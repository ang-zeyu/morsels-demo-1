We're asking his death!\"    \"This is war,\" Gross said, \"and war doesn't wait on the needs of the  individual. You said that yourself. Surely he'll volunteer; we can  keep it on that basis.\"    \"He may already be dead,\" Dolores murmured.    \"We'll find that out,\" Gross said speeding up the car. They drove the  rest of the way in silence.           *       *       *       *       *    For a long time the two of them stood studying the small wood house,  overgrown with ivy, set back on the lot behind an enormous oak. The  little town was silent and sleepy; once in awhile a car moved slowly  along the distant highway, but that was all.    \"This is the place,\" Gross said to Kramer. He folded his arms. \"Quite  a quaint little house.\"    Kramer said nothing. The two Security Agents behind them were  expressionless.    Gross started toward the gate. \"Let's go. According to the check he's  still alive, but very sick. His mind is agile, however. That seems to  be certain. It's said he doesn't leave the house. A woman takes care  of his needs. He's very frail.\"    They went down the stone walk and up onto the porch. Gross rang the  bell. They waited. After a time they heard slow footsteps. The door  opened. An elderly woman in a shapeless wrapper studied them  impassively.    \"Security,\" Gross said, showing his card. \"We wish to see Professor  Thomas.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Government business.\" He glanced at Kramer.    Kramer stepped forward. \"I was a pupil of the Professor's,\" he said.  \"I'm sure he won't mind seeing us.\"    The woman hesitated uncertainly. Gross stepped into the doorway. \"All  right, mother. This is war time. We can't stand out here.\"    The two Security agents followed him, and Kramer came reluctantly  behind, closing the door. Gross stalked down the hall until he came to  an open door. He stopped, looking in. Kramer could see the white  corner of a bed, a wooden post and the edge of a dresser.    He joined Gross.    In the dark room a withered old man lay, propped up on endless  pillows. At first it seemed as if he were asleep; there was no motion  or sign of life. But after a time Kramer saw with a faint shock that  the old man was watching them intently, his eyes fixed on them,  unmoving, unwinking.    \"Professor Thomas?\" Gross said. \"I'm Commander Gross of Security. This  man with me is perhaps known to you--\"    The faded eyes fixed on Kramer.    \"I know him. Philip Kramer.... You've grown heavier, boy.\" The voice  was feeble, the rustle of dry ashes. \"Is it true you're married now?\"    \"Yes. I married Dolores French. You remember her.\" Kramer came toward  the bed. \"But we're separated. It didn't work out very well. Our  careers--\"    \"What we came here about, Professor,\" Gross began, but Kramer cut him  off with an impatient wave.    \"Let me talk. Can't you and your men get out of here long enough to  let me talk to him?\"    Gross swallowed. \"All right, Kramer.\" He nodded to the two men. The  three of them left the room, going out into the hall and closing the  door after them.    The old man in the bed watched Kramer silently. \"I don't think much of  him,\" he said at last. \"I've seen his type before. What's he want?\"    \"Nothing. He just came along. Can I sit down?\" Kramer found a stiff  upright chair beside the bed. \"If I'm bothering you--\"    \"No. I'm glad to see you again, Philip. After so long. I'm sorry your  marriage didn't work out.\"    \"How have you been?\"    \"I've been very ill. I'm afraid that my moment on the world's stage  has almost ended.\" The ancient eyes studied the younger man  reflectively. \"You look as if you have been doing well. Like everyone  else I thought highly of. You've gone to the top in this society.\"    Kramer smiled. Then he became serious. \"Professor, there's a project  we're working on that I want to talk to you about. It's the first ray  of hope we've had in this whole war. If it works, we may be able to  crack the yuk defenses, get some ships into their system. If we can do  that the war might be brought to an end.\"    \"Go on. Tell me about it, if you wish.\"    \"It's a long shot, this project. It may not work at all, but we have  to give it a try.\"    \"It's obvious that you came here because of it,\" Professor Thomas  murmured. \"I'm becoming curious. Go on.\"           *       *       *       *       *    After Kramer finished the old man lay back in the bed without  speaking. At last he sighed.    \"I understand. A human mind, taken out of a human body.\" He sat up a  little, looking at Kramer. \"I suppose you're thinking of me.\"    Kramer said nothing.    \"Before I make my decision I want to see the papers on this, the  theory and outline of construction. I'm not sure I like it.--For  reasons of my own, I mean. But I want to look at the material. If  you'll do that--\"    \"Certainly.\" Kramer stood up and went to the door. Gross and the two  Security Agents were standing outside, waiting tensely. \"Gross, come  inside.\"    They filed into the room.    \"Give the Professor the papers,\" Kramer said. \"He wants to study them  before deciding.\"    Gross brought the file out of his coat pocket, a manila envelope. He  handed it to the old man on the bed. \"Here it is, Professor. You're  welcome to examine it. Will you give us your answer as soon as  possible? We're very anxious to begin, of course.\"    \"I'll give you my answer when I've decided.\" He took the envelope with  a thin, trembling hand. \"My decision depends on what I find out from  these papers. If I don't like what I find, then I will not become  involved with this work in any shape or form.\" He opened the envelope  with shaking hands. \"I'm looking for one thing.\"    \"What is it?\" Gross said.    \"That's my affair. Leave me a number by which I can reach you when  I've decided.\"    Silently, Gross put his card down on the dresser. As they went out  Professor Thomas was already reading the first of the papers, the  outline of the theory.           *       *       *       *       *    Kramer sat across from Dale Winter, his second in line. \"What then?\"  Winter said.    \"He's going to contact us.\" Kramer scratched with a drawing pen on  some paper. \"I don't know what to think.\"    \"What do you mean?\" Winter's good-natured face was puzzled.    \"Look.\" Kramer stood up, pacing back and forth, his hands in his  uniform pockets. \"He was my teacher in college. I respected him as a  man, as well as a teacher. He was more than a voice, a talking book.  He was a person, a calm, kindly person I could look up to. I always  wanted to be like him, someday. Now look at me.\"    \"So?\"    \"Look at what I'm asking. I'm asking for his life, as if he were some  kind of laboratory animal kept around in a cage, not a man, a teacher  at all.\"    \"Do you think he'll do it?\"    \"I don't know.\" Kramer went to the window. He stood looking out. \"In a  way, I hope not.\"    \"But if he doesn't--\"    \"Then we'll have to find somebody else. I know. There would be  somebody else. Why did Dolores have to--\"    The vidphone rang. Kramer pressed the button.    \"This is Gross.\" The heavy features formed. \"The old man called me.  Professor Thomas.\"    \"What did he say?\" He knew; he could tell already, by the sound of  Gross' voice.    \"He said he'd do it. I was a little surprised myself, but apparently  he means it. We've already made arrangements for his admission to the  hospital. His lawyer is drawing up the statement of liability.\"    Kramer only half heard. He nodded wearily. \"All right. I'm glad. I  suppose we can go ahead, then.\"    \"You don't sound very glad.\"    \"I wonder why he decided to go ahead with it.\"    \"He was very certain about it.\" Gross sounded pleased. \"He called me  quite early. I was still in bed. You know, this calls for a  celebration.\"    \"Sure,\" Kramer said. \"It sure does.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Toward the middle of August the project neared completion. They stood  outside in the hot autumn heat, looking up at the sleek metal sides of  the ship.    Gross thumped the metal with his hand. \"Well, it won't be long. We can  begin the test any time.\"    \"Tell us more about this,\" an officer in gold braid said. \"It's such  an unusual concept.\"    \"Is there really a human brain inside the ship?\" a dignitary asked, a  small man in a rumpled suit. \"And the brain is actually alive?\"    \"Gentlemen, this ship is guided by a living brain instead of the usual  Johnson relay-control system. But the brain is not conscious. It will  function by reflex only. The practical difference between it and the  Johnson system is this: a human brain is far more intricate than any  man-made structure, and its ability to adapt itself to a situation, to  respond to danger, is far beyond anything that could be artificially  built.\"    Gross paused, cocking his ear. The turbines of the ship were beginning  to rumble, shaking the ground under them with a deep vibration. Kramer  was standing a short distance away from the others, his arms folded,  watching silently. At the sound of the turbines he walked quickly  around the ship to the other side. A few workmen were clearing away  the last of the waste, the scraps of wiring and scaffolding. They  glanced up at him and went on hurriedly with their work. Kramer  mounted the ramp and entered the control cabin of the ship. Winter was  sitting at the controls with a Pilot from Space-transport.    \"How's it look?\" Kramer asked.    \"All right.\" Winter got up. \"He tells me that it would be best to take  off manually. The robot controls--\" Winter hesitated. \"I mean, the  built-in controls, can take over later on in space.\"    \"That's right,\" the Pilot said. \"It's customary with the Johnson  system, and so in this case we should--\"    \"Can you tell anything yet?\" Kramer asked.    \"No,\" the Pilot said slowly. \"I don't think so. I've been going over  everything. It seems to be in good order. There's only one thing I  wanted to ask you about.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D. (#2)"],[1,"a queer, gliding way; then he  recovered himself and slipped cautiously away from the place of the  explosion, crouching slightly, and still facing the denser part of the  forest. Every few steps he would raise his arm, and point into the  forest with something he held in his hand. Wherever he pointed there was  a terrific explosion, deeper in among the trees. It came to me then that  he was shooting with some form of pistol, though there was neither flash  nor detonation from the muzzle of the weapon itself.    After firing several times, he seemed to come to a sudden resolution,  and turning in my general direction, leaped--to my amazement sailing  through the air between the sparsely scattered trees in such a jump as I  had never in my life seen before. That leap must have carried him a full  fifty feet, although at the height of his arc, he was not more than ten  or twelve feet from the ground.    When he alighted, his foot caught in a projecting root, and he sprawled  gently forward. I say \"gently\" for he did not crash down as I expected  him to do. The only thing I could compare it with was a slow-motion  cinema, although I had never seen one in which horizontal motions were  registered at normal speed and only the vertical movements were slowed  down.    Due to my surprise, I suppose my brain did not function with its normal  quickness, for I gazed at the prone figure for several seconds before I  saw the blood that oozed out from under the tight green cap. Regaining  my power of action, I dragged him out of sight back of the big tree. For  a few moments I busied myself in an attempt to staunch the flow of  blood. The wound was not a deep one. My companion was more dazed than  hurt. But what of the pursuers?    I took the weapon from his grasp and examined it hurriedly. It was not  unlike the automatic pistol to which I was accustomed, except that it  apparently fired with a button instead of a trigger. I inserted several  fresh rounds of ammunition into its magazine from my companion's belt,  as rapidly as I could, for I soon heard, near us, the suppressed  conversation of his pursuers.    There followed a series of explosions round about us, but none very  close. They evidently had not spotted our hiding place, and were firing  at random.    I waited tensely, balancing the gun in my hand, to accustom myself to  its weight and probable throw.    Then I saw a movement in the green foliage of a tree not far away, and  the head and face of a man appeared. Like my companion, he was clad  entirely in green, which made his figure difficult to distinguish. But  his face could be seen clearly. It was an evil face, and had murder in  it.    That decided me. I raised the gun and fired. My aim was bad, for there  was no kick in the gun, as I had expected, and I hit the trunk of the  tree several feet below him. It blew him from his perch like a crumpled  bit of paper, and he _floated_ down to the ground, like some limp, dead  thing, gently lowered by an invisible hand. The tree, its trunk blown  apart by the explosion, crashed down.    There followed another series of explosions around us. These guns we  were using made no sound in the firing, and my opponents were evidently  as much at sea as to my position as I was to theirs. So I made no  attempt to reply to their fire, contenting myself with keeping a sharp  lookout in their general direction. And patience had its reward.    Very soon I saw a cautious movement in the top of another tree. Exposing  myself as little as possible, I aimed carefully at the tree trunk and  fired again. A shriek followed the explosion. I heard the tree crash  down; then a groan.    There was silence for a while. Then I heard a faint sound of boughs  swishing. I shot three times in its direction, pressing the button as  rapidly as I could. Branches crashed down where my shells had exploded,  but there was no body.    Then I saw one of them. He was starting one of those amazing leaps from  the bough of one tree to another, about forty feet away.    I threw up my gun impulsively and fired. By now I had gotten the feel of  the weapon, and my aim was good. I hit him. The \"bullet\" must have  penetrated his body and exploded. For one moment I saw him flying  through the air. Then the explosion, and he had vanished. He never  finished his leap. It was annihilation.    How many more of them there were I don't know. But this must have been  too much for them. They used a final round of shells on us, all of which  exploded harmlessly, and shortly after I heard them swishing and  crashing away from us through the tree tops. Not one of them descended  to earth.    Now I had time to give some attention to my companion. She was, I found,  a girl, and not a boy. Despite her bulky appearance, due to the peculiar  belt strapped around her body high up under the arms, she was very  slender, and very pretty.    There was a stream not far away, from which I brought water and bathed  her face and wound.    Apparently the mystery of these long leaps, the monkey-like ability to  jump from bough to bough, and of the bodies that floated gently down  instead of falling, lay in the belt. The thing was some sort of  anti-gravity belt that almost balanced the weight of the wearer, thereby  tremendously multiplying the propulsive power of the leg muscles, and  the lifting power of the arms.    When the girl came to, she regarded me as curiously as I did her, and  promptly began to quiz me. Her accent and intonation puzzled me a lot,  but nevertheless we were able to understand each other fairly well,  except for certain words and phrases. I explained what had happened  while she lay unconscious, and she thanked me simply for saving her  life.    \"You are a strange exchange,\" she said, eying my clothing quizzically.  Evidently she found it mirth provoking by contrast with her own neatly  efficient garb. \"Don't you understand what I mean by 'exchange?' I mean  ah--let me see--a stranger, somebody from some other gang. What gang do  you belong to?\" (She pronounced it \"gan,\" with only a suspicion of a  nasal sound.)    I laughed. \"I'm not a gangster,\" I said. But she evidently did not  understand this word. \"I don't belong to any gang,\" I explained, \"and  never did. Does everybody belong to a gang nowadays?\"    \"Naturally,\" she said, frowning. \"If you don't belong to a gang, where  and how do you live? Why have you not found and joined a gang? How do  you eat? Where do you get your clothing?\"    \"I've been eating wild game for the past two weeks,\" I explained, \"and  this clothing I--er--ah--.\" I paused, wondering how I could explain that  it must be many hundred years old.    In the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I could,  piecing it together with my assumptions as to what had happened. She  listened patiently; incredulously at first, but with more confidence as  I went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a long time.    \"That's hard to believe,\" she said, \"but I believe it.\" She looked me  over with frank interest.    \"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down in that  mine?\" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never married. \"Well,  that simplifies matters,\" she continued. \"You see, if you were  technically classed as a family man, I could take you back only as an  invited exchange and I, being unmarried, and no relation of yours,  couldn't do the inviting.\"          CHAPTER II    The Forest Gangs      She gave me a brief outline of the very peculiar social and economic  system under which her people lived. At least it seemed very peculiar  from my 20th Century viewpoint.    I learned with amazement that exactly 492 years had passed over my head  as I lay unconscious in the mine.    Wilma, for that was her name, did not profess to be a historian, and so  could give me only a sketchy outline of the wars that had been fought,  and the manner in which such radical changes had come about. It seemed  that another war had followed the First World War, in which nearly all  the European nations had banded together to break the financial and  industrial power of America. They succeeded in their purpose, though  they were beaten, for the war was a terrific one, and left America, like  themselves, gasping, bleeding and disorganized, with only the hollow  shell of a victory.    This opportunity had been seized by the Russian Soviets, who had made a  coalition with the Chinese, to sweep over all Europe and reduce it to a  state of chaos.    America, industrially geared to world production and the world trade,  collapsed economically, and there ensued a long period of stagnation and  desperate attempts at economic reconstruction. But it was impossible to  stave off war with the Mongolians, who by now had subjugated the  Russians, and were aiming at a world empire.    In about 2109, it seems, the conflict was finally precipitated. The  Mongolians, with overwhelming fleets of great airships, and a science  that far outstripped that of crippled America, swept in over the Pacific  and Atlantic Coasts, and down from Canada, annihilating American  aircraft, armies and cities with their terrific _disintegrator_ rays.  These rays were projected from a machine not unlike a searchlight in  appearance, the reflector of which, however, was not material substance,  but a complicated balance of interacting electronic forces. This  resulted in a terribly destructive beam. Under its influence, material  substance melted into \"nothingness\"; i. e., into electronic vibrations.  It destroyed all then known substances, from air to the most dense  metals and stone.    They settled down to the establishment of what became known as the Han  dynasty in America, as a sort of province in their World Empire.    Those were terrible days for the Americans. They were hunted like wild  beasts. Only those survived who finally found refuge in mountains,  canyons and forests. Government was at an end"]]]
