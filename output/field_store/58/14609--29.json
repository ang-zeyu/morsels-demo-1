From its five hundred and forty gates,  each wide enough for eight hundred men abreast to march through,  the warriors rushed every morning to fight a battle that lasted  till nightfall and began again at the break of each day. When the  heroes returned to Valhalla the Valkyries served them with goblets  of mead such as Woden drank himself.    The Teutons believed that before there were any gods or any world  there was a great empty space where the world now is. It was called  by the curious name Gin'nungagap, which means a yawning abyss.    [Illustration: ONE OF THE VALKYRIES BEARING A HERO TO VALHALLA]    To the north of Ginnungagap it was bitterly cold. Nothing was there  but fields of snow and mountains of ice. To the south of Ginnungagap  was a region where frost and snow were never seen. It was always  bright, and was the home of light and heat. The sunshine from the  South melted the ice mountains of the North so that they toppled  over and fell into Ginnungagap. There they were changed into a  frost giant whose name was Ymir (_e'mir_). He had three sons. They  and their father were so strong that the gods were afraid of them.    So Woden and his brothers killed Ymir. They broke his body in pieces  and made the world of them. His bones and teeth became mountains  and rocks; his hair became leaves for trees and plants; out of  his skull was made the sky.    But Ymir was colder than ice, and the earth that was made of his  body was so cold that nothing could live or grow upon it. So the  gods took sparks from the home of light and set them in the sky.  Two big ones were the sun and moon and the little ones were the  stars. Then the earth became warm. Trees grew and flowers bloomed,  so that the world was a beautiful home for men.    Of all the trees the most wonderful was a great ash tree, sometimes  called the \"world tree.\" Its branches covered the earth and reached  beyond the sky till they almost touched the stars. Its roots ran  in three directions, to heaven, to the frost giants' home and to  the under-world, beneath the earth.    Near the roots in the dark under-world sat the Norns, or fates.  Each held a bowl with which she dipped water out of a sacred spring  and poured it upon the roots of the ash tree. This was the reason  why this wonderful tree was always growing, and why it grew as  high as the sky.    When Woden killed Ymir he tried to kill all Ymir's children too;  but one escaped, and ever after he and his family, the frost giants,  tried to do mischief, and fought against gods and men.    According to the belief of the Teutons these wicked giants will  some day destroy the beautiful world. Even the gods themselves  will be killed in a dreadful battle with them. First of all will  come three terrible winters without any spring or summer. The sun  and moon will cease to shine and the bright stars will fall from the  sky. The earth will be shaken as when there is a great earthquake;  the waves of the sea will roar and the highest mountains will totter  and fall. The trees will be torn up by the roots, and even the  \"world tree\" will tremble from its roots to its topmost boughs.  At last the quivering earth will sink beneath the waters of the  sea.    Then Loki, the spirit of evil, will break loose from the fetters  with which the gods have bound him. The frost giants will join him.  They will try to make a secret attack on the gods. But Heimdall, the  sentry of heaven, will be on guard at the end of the rainbow-bridge.  He needs no more sleep than a bird and can see for a hundred miles  either by day or night. He only can sound the horn whose blast  can be heard through heaven and earth and the under-world. Loki  and his army will be seen by him. His loud alarm will sound and  bring the gods together. They will rush to meet the giants. Woden  will wield his spear--Tiew his glittering sword--Thor his terrible  hammer. These will all be in vain. The gods must die. But so must  the giants and Loki.    And then a new earth will rise from the sea. The leaves of its  forests will never fall; its fields will yield harvests unsown.  And in a hall far brighter than Woden's Valhalla the brave and  good will be gathered forever.          THE NIBELUNGS    I    The time came when the people of Western Europe learned to believe  in one God and were converted to Christianity, but the old stories  about the gods and Valkyries and giants and heroes, who were half  gods and half men, were not forgotten.    These stories were repeated from father to son for generations,  and in the twelfth century a poet, whose name we do not know, wrote  them in verse. He called his poem the Ni'bel-ung'en-lied (song  of the Nibelungs). It is the great national poem of the Germans.  The legends told in it are the basis of Wagner's operas.    \"Nibelungs\" was the name given to some northern dwarfs whose king  had once possessed a great treasure of gold and precious stones but  had lost it. Whoever got possession of this treasure was followed  by a curse. The Nibelungenlied tells the adventures of those who  possessed the treasure.    II    In the grand old city of Worms, in Burgundy, there lived long ago  the princess Kriemhilda. Her eldest brother Gunther was king of  Burgundy.    And in the far-away Netherlands, where the Rhine pours its waters  into the sea, dwelt a prince named Siegfried, son of Siegmund,  the king.    Ere long Sir Siegfried heard of the beauty of fair Kriemhilda.  He said to his father, \"Give me twelve knights and I will ride to  King Gunther's land. I must win the heart of Kriemhilda.\"    After seven days' journey the prince and his company drew near  to the gates of Worms. All wondered who the strangers were and  whence they came. Hagen, Kriemhilda's uncle, guessed. He said,  \"I never have seen the famed hero of Netherlands, yet I am sure  that yonder knight is none but Sir Siegfried.\"    \"And who,\" asked the wondering people, \"may Siegfried be?\"    \"Siegfried,\" answered Sir Hagen, \"is a truly wonderful knight.  Once when riding all alone, he came to a mountain where lay the  treasure of the king of the Nibelungs. The king's two sons had  brought it out from the cave in which it had been hidden, to divide  it between them. But they did not agree about the division. So  when Seigfied drew near both princes said, 'Divide for us, Sir  Siegfried, our father's hoard.' There were so many jewels that  one hundred wagons could not carry them, and of ruddy gold there  was even more. Seigfied made the fairest division he could, and as  a reward the princes gave him their father's sword called Balmung.  But although Siegfried had done his best to satisfy them with his  division, they soon fell to quarreling and fighting, and when he  tried to separate them they made an attack on him. To save his  own life he slew them both. Alberich, a mountain dwarf, who had  long been guardian of the Nibelung hoard, rushed to avenge his  masters; but Siegfried vanquished him and took from him his cap of  darkness which made its wearer invisible and gave him the strength  of twelve men. The hero then ordered Alberich to place the treasure  again in the mountain cave and guard it for him.\"    Hagen then told another story of Siegfried:    \"Once he slew a fierce dragon and bathed himself in its blood,  and this turned the hero's skin to horn, so that no sword or spear  can wound him.\"    When Hagen had told these tales he advised King Gunther and the  people of Burgundy to receive Siegfried with all honor.    [Illustration: SIEGFRIED SLAYS THE DRAGON]    So, as the fashion was in those times, games were held in the courtyard  of the palace in honor of Siegfried, and Kriemhilda watched the  sport from her window.    For a full year Siegfried stayed at the court of King Gunther,  but never in all that time told why he had come and never once saw  Kriemhilda.    At the end of the year sudden tidings came that the Saxons and  Danes, as was their habit, were pillaging the lands of Burgundy.  At the head of a thousand Burgundian knights Siegfried conquered  both Saxons and Danes. The king of the Danes was taken prisoner  and the Saxon king surrendered.    The victorious warriors returned to Worms and the air was filled  with glad shouts of welcome. King Gunther asked Kriemhilda to welcome  Siegfried and offer him the thanks of all the land of Burgundy.    Siegfried stood before her, and she said, \"Welcome, Sir Siegfried,  welcome; we thank you one and all.\" He bent before her and she  kissed him.    III    Far over the sea from sunny Burgundy lived Brunhilda, queen of  Iceland. Fair was she of face and strong beyond compare. If a knight  would woo and win her he must surpass her in three contests: leaping,  hurling the spear and pitching the stone. If he failed in even  one, he must forfeit his life.    King Gunther resolved to wed this strange princess and Siegfried  promised to help him. \"But,\" said Siegfried, \"if we succeed, I must  have as my wife thy sister Kriemhilda.\" To this Gunther agreed,  and the voyage to Iceland began.    When Gunther and his companions neared Brunhilda's palace the gates  were opened and the strangers were welcomed.    Siegfried thanked the queen for her kindness and told how Gunther  had come to Iceland in hope of winning her hand.    \"If in three contests he gain the mastery,\" she said, \"I will become  his wife. If not, both he and you who are with him must lose your  lives.\"    Brunhilda prepared for the contests. Her shield was so thick and  heavy that four strong men were needed to bear it. Three could  scarcely carry her spear and the stone that she hurled could just  be lifted by twelve.    Siegfried now helped Gunther in a wonderful way. He put on his  cap of darkness, so that no one could see him. Then he stood by  Gunther's side and did the fighting. Brunhilda threw her spear  against the kings bright shield and sparks flew from the steel.

His mother, at any rate, was a Frenchwoman, whom his  father seduced during a sojourn at Paris, and afterwards deserted. So much  as this Boccaccio has himself told us, under a transparent veil of allegory,  in his Ameto. Of his mother we would fain know more, for his wit has in it  a quality, especially noticeable in the Tenth Novel of the Sixth Day of the  Decameron, which marks him out as the forerunner of Rabelais, and prompts us  to ask how much more his genius may have owed to his French ancestry. His  father was of sufficient standing in Florence to be chosen Prior in 1321;  but this brief term of office--but two months--was his last, as well as his  first experience of public life. Of Boccaccio's early years we know nothing  more than that his first preceptor was the Florentine grammarian, Giovanni  da Strada, father of the poet Zanobi da Strada, and that, when he was about  ten years old, he was bound apprentice to a merchant, with whom he spent  the next six years at Paris, whence he returned to Florence with an  inveterate repugnance to commerce. His father then proposed to make a  canonist of him; but the study of Gratian proved hardly more congenial than  the routine of the counting-house to the lad, who had already evinced a  taste for letters; and a sojourn at Naples, where under the regime of the  enlightened King Robert there were coteries of learned men, and even Greek  was not altogether unknown, decided his future career. According to Filippo  Villani his choice was finally fixed by a visit to the tomb of Vergil on the  Via Puteolana, and, though the modern critical spirit is apt to discount such  stories, there can be no doubt that such a pilgrimage would be apt to make a  deep, and perhaps enduring, impression upon a nature ardent and sensitive,  and already conscious of extraordinary powers. His stay at Naples was also in  another respect a turning point in his life; for it was there that, as we  gather from the Filocopo, he first saw the blonde beauty, Maria, natural  daughter of King Robert, whom he has immortalized as Fiammetta. The place was  the church of San Lorenzo, the day the 26th of March, 1334. Boccaccio's  admiring gaze was observed by the lady, who, though married, proved no Laura,  and forthwith returned his love in equal measure. Their liaison lasted several  years, during which Boccaccio recorded the various phases of their passion  with exemplary assiduity in verse and prose. Besides paying her due and  discreet homage in sonnet and canzone, he associated her in one way or another,  not only with the Filocopo (his prose romance of Florio and Biancofiore, which  he professes to have written to pleasure her), but with the Ameto, the Amorosa  Visione, the Teseide, and the Filostrato; and in L'Amorosa Fiammetta he wove  out of their relations a romance in which her lover, who is there called  Pamfilo, plays Aeneas to her Dido, though with somewhat less tragic  consequences. The Proem to the Decameron shews us the after-glow of his  passion; the lady herself appears as one of the \"honourable company,\" and  her portrait, as in the act of receiving the laurel wreath at the close of  the Fourth Day, is a masterpiece of tender and delicate delineation.    Boccaccio appears to have been recalled to Florence by his father in 1341;  and it was probably in that year that he wrote L'Amorosa Fiammetta and the  allegorical prose pastoral (with songs interspersed) which he entitled  Ameto, and in which Fiammetta masquerades in green as one of the nymphs.  The Amorosa Visione, written about the same time, is not only an allegory but  an acrostic, the initial letters of its fifteen hundred triplets composing two  sonnets and a ballade in honour of Fiammetta, whom he here for once ventures  to call by her true name. Later came the Teseide, or romance of Palamon and  Arcite, the first extant rendering of the story, in twelve books, and the  Filostrato, nine books of the loves and woes of Troilus and Cressida. Both  these poems are in ottava rima, a metre which, if Boccaccio did not invent  it, he was the first to apply to such a purpose. Both works were dedicated  to Fiammetta. A graceful idyll in the same metre, Ninfale Fiesolano, was  written later, probably at Naples in 1345. King Robert was then dead, but  Boccaccio enjoyed the favour of Queen Joan, of somewhat doubtful memory, at  whose instance he hints in one of his later letters that he wrote the  Decameron. Without impugning Boccaccio's veracity we can hardly but think  that the Decameron would have seen the light, though Queen Joan had withheld  her encouragement. He had probably been long meditating it, and gathering  materials for it, and we may well suppose that the outbreak of the plague in  1348, by furnishing him with a sombre background to heighten the effect of  his motley pageant, had far more to do with accelerating the composition  than aught that Queen Joan may have said.    That Boccaccio was not at Florence during the pestilence is certain; but we  need not therefore doubt the substantial accuracy of his marvellous  description of the state of the stricken city, for the course and  consequences of the terrible visitation must have been much the same in all  parts of Italy, and as to Florence in particular, Boccaccio could have no  difficulty in obtaining detailed and abundant information from credible  eye-witnesses. The introduction of Fiammetta, who was in all probability at  Naples at the time, and in any case was not a Florentine, shews, however,  that he is by no means to be taken literally, and renders it extremely  probable that the facetious, irrepressible, and privileged Dioneo is no  other than himself. At the same time we cannot deem it either impossible,  or very unlikely, that in the general relaxation of morale, which the plague  brought in its train, refuge from care and fear was sought in the diversions  which he describes by some of those who had country-seats to which to  withdraw, and whether the \"contado\" was that of Florence or that of Naples  is a matter of no considerable importance. (1) It is probable that  Boccaccio's father was one of the victims of the pestilence; for he was dead  in 1350, when his son returned to Florence to live thenceforth on the modest  patrimony which he inherited. It must have been about this time that he  formed an intimacy with Petrarch, which, notwithstanding marked diversity  of temperament, character and pursuits, was destined to be broken only by  death. Despite his complaints of the malevolence of his critics in the Proem  to the Fourth Day of the Decameron, he had no lack of appreciation on the  part of his fellow-citizens, and was employed by the Republic on several  missions; to Bologna, probably with the view of averting the submission of  that city to the Visconti in 1350; to Petrarch at Padua in March 1351, with  a letter from the Priors announcing his restitution to citizenship, and  inviting him to return to Florence, and assume the rectorship of the newly  founded university; to Ludwig of Brandenburg with overtures for an alliance  against the Visconti in December of the same year; and in the spring of 1354  to Pope Innocent VI. at Avignon in reference to the approaching visit of the  Emperor Charles IV. to Italy. About this time, 1354-5, he threw off, in  striking contrast to his earlier works, an invective against women, entitled  Laberinto d'Amore, otherwise Corbaccio, a coarse performance occasioned by  resentment at what he deemed capricious treatment by a lady to whom he had  made advances. To the same period, though the date cannot be precisely fixed,  belongs his Life of Dante, a work of but mediocre merit. Somewhat later, it  would seem, he began the study of Greek under one Leontius Pilatus, a  Calabrian, who possessed some knowledge of that language, and sought to pass  himself off as a Greek by birth.    Leontius was of coarse manners and uncertain temper, but Boccaccio was his  host and pupil for some years, and eventually procured him the chair of  Greek in the university of Florence. How much Greek Boccaccio learned from  him, and how far he may have been beholden to him in the compilation of  his elaborate Latin treatise De Genealogia Deorum, in which he essayed with  very curious results to expound the inner meaning of mythology, it is  impossible to say. In 1361 he seems to have had serious thoughts of  devoting himself to religion, being prodigiously impressed by the menaces,  monitions and revelations of a dying Carthusian of Siena. One of the  revelations concerned a matter which Boccaccio had supposed to be known only  to Petrarch and himself. He accordingly confided his anxiety to Petrarch,  who persuaded him to "]]]
