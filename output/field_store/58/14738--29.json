The essay on Israel and Judaism with which the Prolegomena close,  may in like manner be profitably compared with sect. II of the  appended sketch--a section which is not taken directly from the  \"Encyclopaedia\", but translated from the German edition of the  article \"Israel\", where the subject is expanded by the author.  Here the reader will learn how close are the bonds that connect  the critical study of the Old Testament with the deepest and  unchanging problems of living faith.

TABLE OF CONTENTS.                           PROLEGOMENA.    INTRODUCTION--    1.  Is the Law the starting-point for the history of ancient  Israel or for that of Judaism ?  The latter possibility  is not precluded a priori by the history of the Canon. Reasons  for considering it. De Wette, George, Vatke, Reuss, Graf    2.  The three strata of the Pentateuch: Deuteronomy, Priestly  Code, Jehovist    3.  The question is as to the Priestly Code and its historical  position.  Method of the investigation        A.  HISTORY OF WORSHIP.      CHAPTER  I.  THE PLACE OF WORSHIP--    I.I.1.   The historical and prophetical books show no trace in Hebrew  antiquity of a sanctuary of exclusive legitimacy    I.I.2.   Polemic of the prophets against the sanctuaries.  Fall of Samaria.  Reformation of Josiah    I.I.3.   Influence of the Babylonian exile    I.II.1.  The Jehovist (JE) sanctions a multiplicity of altars    I.II.2.  Deuteronomy (D) demands local unity of worship    I.II.3.  The Priestly Code (RQ) presupposes that unity, and transfers  it, by means of the Tabernacle, to primitive times    I.III.1. The tabernacle, as a central sanctuary and dwelling  for the ark, can nowhere be found in the historical tradition    I.III.2. Noldeke's view untenable      CHAPTER II. SACRIFICE--    II.I.1.   The ritual is according to RQ the main subject of the Mosaic  legislation, according to JE it is pre-Mosaic usage;  in RQ the point is How, according to JE and D To Whom,  it is offered    II.I.2.   The historical books agree with JE; the prophets down to  Ezekiel contradict RQ    II.II.1.  Material innovations in RQ.  Preliminary  remarks on the  notion, contents, mode of offering, and propitiatory effects of  sacrifice.    II.II.2.  Material and ideal refinement of the offerings in RQ    II.II.3.  The sacrificial meal gives way to holocausts    II.II.4.  Development of the trespass-offering.    II.III.1. The centralisation of worship at Jerusalem destroyed  the connection of sacrifice with the natural occasions of life,  so that it lost its original character          CHAPTER III. THE SACRED FEASTS--      III.I.1.   In JE and D there is a rotation of three festivals.   Easter  and Pentecost mark the beginning and the end of the corn-harvest,  and the autumn feast the vintage and the bringing home the corn  from the threshing-floor.  With the feast of unleavened bread  (Massoth) is conjoined, especially in D, the feast of the  sacrifice of the male firstborn of cattle (Pesah).    III.I.2.   The feasts based on the offering of firstlings of the field and  of the herd.  Significance of the land and of agriculture for religion    III.II.1.  In the historical and prophetical books, the autumn feast  only is distinctly attested, and it is the most important in JE  and D also: of the others there are only faint traces .    III.II.2.  But the nature of the festivals is the same as in JE and D    III.III.1. In RQ the feasts have lost their reference to harvest  and the first fruits; and this essentially changes their  nature    III.III.2. The metamorphosis was due to the centralisation of worship,  and may he traced down through Deuteronomy and Ezekiel to RQ,    III.III.3. To the three festivals RQ adds the great day of atonement,  which arose out of the fast-days of the exile    III.IV.1.  The Sabbath, which is connected with the new moon, was  originally a lunar festival  Exaggeration of the Sabbath rest in the Priestly Code    III.IV.2.  Sabbatical year, and year of Jubilee      CHAP.  IV.  THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES--      IV.I.1.   According to Ezek. xliv., only the Levites of Jerusalem,  the sons of Zadok, are to continue priests in the new  Jerusalem; the other Levites are to be degraded to their servants  and denuded of their priestly rights.  According to RQ  the Levites never possessed the priestly right, but only  the sons of Aaron    IV.I.2.  These answer to the sons of Zadok    IV.II.1.  In the earliest period of the history of Israel there is no  distinction between clergy and laity.  Every one may  slaughter and sacrifice; there are professional priests only at the  great sanctuaries.  Priestly families at Sihiloh and Dan.    No setting apart of what is holy    IV.II.2.  Royal temples of the kings; priests at them as royal officials    IV.II.3.  Importance of the North-Israelite priesthood in the time of the  kings    IV.II.4.  The family of Zadok at Jerusalem    IV.III.1. In the oldest part of JE there are no priests; no Aaron  by the side of Moses    IV.III.2. In D the Levites are priests.  They occur in that character,  not to speak of Judges xviii. seq., only in the literature  of the exile.  Their descent from Moses or Aaron.  The spiritual  and the secular tribe of Levi.  Difficulty of bringing them together    IV.III.3. Consolidation of the spiritual tribe in RQ; separation of  priests and Levites.  Further development of the clergy after the  exile.  The high priest as head of the theocracy        CHAPTER V.  THE ENDOWMENT OF THE CLERGY--      V.I.1.   The sacrificial dues raised in RQ    V.I.2.   The firstlings were turned into contributions to the priests,  and doubled in amount    V.II.1.  Levitical towns    V.II.2.  The historical situation underlying the priestly pretensions  in RQ        B.  HISTORY OF TRADITION.      CHAPTER  VI.  CHRONICLES--    VI.I.1.  David becomes Saul's successor without any exertion, all  Israel being already on his side, namely, the priests and Levites    Distortion of the original story of the bringing of the ark  to Jerusalem.  Omission of unedifying incidents in David's life    VI.I.2.  Preparation for the building of the temple.  Delight of the  narrator in numbers and names.  Inconsistency with 1Kings i, ii.    Picture of David in Chronicles    VI.I.3.  Solomon's sacrifice at the tabernacle at Gibeah.  Building  of the temple.  Retouching of the original narrative    VI.II.1. Estimate of the relation between Judah and Israel; the  Israelites do not belong to the temple, nor, consequently,  to the theocracy    VI.II.2. Levitical idealising of Judah.  View taken of those acts of  rulers in the temple-worship which the books of Kings condemn or  approve. Inconsistencies with the narrative of the sources;  importation of priests and Levites.    VI.II.3. Divine pragmatism of the sacred history, and its results    VI.II.4. The books of Kings obviously present throughout    VI.III.1. The genealogical registers of I Chron.i-ix  The ten tribes    VI.III.2. Judah and Levi    VI.III.3. Chronicles had no other sources for the period before the exile  than the historical books preserved to us in the Canon.  The diversity of historical view is due to the influence of the law,  especially the Priestly Code.  The Midrash      CHAPTER  VII.  JUDGES, SAMUEL, AND KINGS--    VII.I.1.   The formula on which the book of Judges is constructed  in point of chronology and of religion    VII.I.2.   Its relation to the stem of the tradition.  Judg. xix.-xxi.    VI.II.3.   Occasional additions to the original narratives    VII.I.4.   Difference of religious attitude in the latter    VII.II.1.  Chronological and religious formulas in the books of Samuel    VII.II.2.  The stories of the rise of the monarchy and the elevation  of Saul entirely recast    VII.II.3.  Saul's relation to Samuel    VII.II.4.  The narrative of David's youth  The view taken of Samuel may be regarded as a measure of the growth  of the tradition Saul and David    VII.III.1. The last religious chronological revision of the books of  Kings.  Similar in kind to that of Judges and Samuel  Its standpoint Judaean and Deuteronomistic    VII.III.2. Its relation to the materials received from tradition    VII.III.3. Differences of sentiment in the sources    VII.III.4. In Chronicles the history  of ancient Israel is recast  in accordance with the ideas of the Priestly Code; in the  older historical books it is judged according to the standard of  Deuteronomy      CHAPTER  VIII.  THE NARRATIVE OF THE HEXATEUCH--    VIII.I.1.   Genesis i. and Genesis ii. iii.    VIII.I.2.   Genesis iv.-xi.    VIII.I.3.   The primitive world-history in JE and in Q    VIII.II.1.  The history  of the patriarchs in JE    VIII.II.2.  The history  of the patriarchs in Q    VIII.II.3.  Periods, numbers, covenants, sacrifices in the patriarchal  age in Q    VIII.III.1. The Mosaic history in JE and in Q    VII.III.2. Comparison of the various narratives    VII.III.3. Conclusion .      C.  ISRAEL AND JUDAISM.      CHAPTER  IX.  CONCLUSION OF THE CRITICISM OF THE LAW--      IX.I.1.   The veto of critical analysis    IX.I.2.   The historical presuppositions of Deuteronomy    IX.I.3.   The Deuteronomistic revision does not extend over the Priestly  Code    IX.II.1.  The final revision of the Hexateuch proceeds from the  Priestly  Code, as we see from Leviticus xvii. seq.

This  was in November.    Poor Juan, who had always cherished the thought of his brother's  return, now in the depths of his misery nursed his chimera with  redoubled faith. He had a letter written and sent to Havana. As he  had no idea how his brother could be reached, the letter bore no  direction. He made all manner of inquiries, but to no effect, and  he spent long hours on his knees, hoping that Heaven might send  Santiago to his rescue. His only happy moments were those spent in  prayer, as he knelt behind a pillar in the far-off corner of some  solitary church, breathing the acrid odors of dampness and melting  wax, listening to the flickering sputter of the tapers and the faint  murmur rising from the lips of the faithful in the nave of the  temple. His innocent soul then soared above the cruelties of life  and communed with God and the Holy Mother. From his early childhood  devotion to the Virgin had been deeply rooted in his heart. As he had  never known his mother, he instinctively turned to the mother of God  for that tender and loving protection which only a woman can give a  child. He had composed a number of hymns and canticles in her honor,  and he never fell asleep without pressing his lips to the image of  the Carmen, which he wore on his neck.    There came a day, however, when heaven and earth forsook him. Driven  from his last shelter, without a crust to save him from starvation,  or a cloak to protect him from the cold, he realized with terror  that the time had come when he would have to beg. A great struggle  took place in his soul. Shame and suffering made a desperate stand  against necessity. The profound darkness which surrounded him  increased the anguish of the strife; but hunger conquered in the  end. He prayed for strength with sobs, and resigned himself to his  fate. Still, wishing to disguise his humiliation, he determined to  sing in the streets, at night only. His voice was good, and he had a  rare knowledge of the art of singing. It occurred to him that he had  no means of accompaniment. But he soon found another unfortunate,  perhaps a trifle less wretched than himself, who lent him an old  and broken guitar. He mended it as best he could, and with a voice  hoarse with tears he went out into the street on a frosty December  night. His heart beat violently; his knees trembled under him. When  he tried to sing in one of the central thoroughfares, he found he  could not utter a sound. Suffering and shame seemed to have tied a  knot in his throat. He groped about until he had found a wall to lean  against. There he stood for awhile, and when he felt a little calmer  he began the tenor's aria from the first act of \"Favorita.\" A blind  singer who sang neither couplets nor popular songs soon excited some  curiosity among the passers-by, and in a few minutes a crowd had  gathered around him. There was a murmur of surprise and admiration at  the art with which he overcame the difficulties of the composition,  and many a copper was dropped in the hat that dangled from his arm.  After this he sang the aria of the fourth act of \"Africana.\" But too  many had stopped to listen, and the authorities began to fear that  this might be a cause of disturbance; for it is a well-established  fact with officials of the police force that people who congregate in  the streets to hear a blind man sing are always prompted by motives  of rebellion,--it means a peculiar hostility to the institutions; in  a word, an attitude thoroughly incompatible with the peace of society  and the security of the State. Accordingly, a policeman caught Juan  energetically by the arm and said, \"Here, here! go straight home now,  and don't let me catch you stopping at any more street corners.\"    \"I'm doing no harm!\"    \"You are blocking the thoroughfare. Come, move on, move on, if you  don't want to go to the lock-up.\"    It is really encouraging to see how careful our authorities are in  clearing the streets of blind singers; and I really believe, in spite  of all that has been said to the contrary, that if they could keep  them equally free from thieves and murderers, they would do so with  pleasure. Juan went back to his hovel with a heavy heart, for he was  by nature shrinking and timid, and was grieved at having disturbed  the peace and given rise to the interference of the executive power.  He had made twenty-seven cents. With this he bought something to eat  on the following day, and paid rent for the little pile of straw on  which he slept. The next night he went out again and sang a few more  operatic arias; but the people again crowded around him, and once  more a policeman felt himself called upon to interfere, shouting at  him to move on. But how could he? If he kept moving on, he would not  make a cent. He could not expect the people to follow him. Juan moved  on, however, on and on, because he was timid, and the mere thought of  infringing the laws, of disturbing even momentarily the peace of his  native land, was worse than death to him. So his earnings rapidly  decreased. The necessity of moving on, on the one hand, and the fact  that his performances had lost the charm of novelty, which in Spain  always commands its price, daily deprived him of a few coppers. With  what he brought home at night he could scarcely buy enough food to  keep him alive. The situation was desperate. The poor boy saw but one  luminous point in the clouded horizon of his life, and that was his  brother's return to Madrid. Every night as he left his hovel with his  guitar swinging from his shoulder he thought, \"If Santiago should be  in Madrid and hear me sing, he would know me by my voice.\" And this  hope, or rather this chimera, alone gave him the strength to endure  life. However, there came again a day in which his anguish knew no  limit. On the preceding night he had earned only six coppers. It had  been so cold! This was Christmas Eve. When the morning dawned upon  the world, it found Madrid wrapped in a sheet of snow six inches  thick. It snowed steadily all day long, which was a matter of little  consequence to the majority of people, and was even a cause of much  rejoicing among æsthetes generally. Those poets in particular who  enjoy what is called easy circumstances spent the greater part of  the day watching the flakes through the plate-glass of their study  windows, meditating upon and elaborating those graceful and ingenious  similes that cause the audiences at the theatre to shout, \"Bravo,  bravo!\" or those who read their verses to exclaim, \"What a genius  that young fellow is!\"    Juan's breakfast had been a crust of stale bread and a cup of watery  coffee. He could not divert his hunger by contemplating the beauty  of the snow,--in the first place, because he was blind, and in the  second, because, even had he not been blind, he would have had some  difficulty in seeing it through the patched and filthy panes of his  hovel. He spent the day huddled in a corner on his straw mattress,  evoking scenes of his childhood and caressing the sweet dream of his  brother's return. At nightfall he grew very faint, but necessity  drove him into the streets to beg. His guitar was gone. He had sold  it for sixty cents on a day of similar hardship. The snow fell with  the same persistence. His legs trembled as they had when he sang  for the first time, but now it was from hunger rather than shame.  He groped about as best he could, with great lumps of mud above his  ankles. The silence told him that there was scarcely a soul on the  street. The carriages rolled noiselessly along, and he once came  near being run over. In one of the central thoroughfares he began  to sing the first thing that came to his lips. His voice was weak  and hoarse. Nobody stopped to listen. \"Let us try another street,\"  thought he; and he went down the Avenue of San Jerónimo, walking  awkwardly in the snow, with a white coating on his shoulders and  water squirting from his shoes. The cold had begun to penetrate into  his very bones, and hunger gave him a violent pain. For a moment  with the cold and the pain came a feeling of faintness which made  him think that he was about to die, and lifting his spirit to the  Virgin of the Carmen, his protectress, he exclaimed in his anguish,  \"Mother, have pity!\" And after pronouncing these words he felt  relieved and walked, or rather dragged himself, to the Plaza de las  Cortes. There he grasped a lamp-post, and under the impression of the  Virgin's protection sang Gounod's \"Ave Maria.\" Still nobody stopped  to hear him. The people of Madrid were at the theatres, at the cafés,  or at home, dancing their little ones on their knees in the glow  of the hearth,--in the warmth of their love. The snow continued to  fall steadily, copiously, with the evident purpose of furnishing a  topic for the local column of the morning paper, where it would be  described in a thousand delicate phrases. The occasional passers-by  hurried along muffled up to their ears under their umbrellas. The  lamp-posts had put on their white night-caps, from under which  escaped thin rays of dismal light. The silence was broken only by  the vague and distant rumble of carriages and by the light fall of  the snowflakes, that sounded like the faint and continuous rustle  of silk. The voice of Juan alone vibrated in the stillness of the  night, imploring the mother of the unprotected; and his chant seemed  a cry of anguish rather than a hymn of praise, a moan of sadness and  resignation falling dreary and chill, like snow upon the heart.    And his cry for pity was in vain. In vain he repeated the sweet name  of Mary, adjusting it to the modulations of every melody. Heaven and  the Virgin were far away, it seemed, and could not hear him. The  neighbors of the plaza were near at hand, but they did not choose  to hear. Nobody came down to take him in from the cold; no"]]]
