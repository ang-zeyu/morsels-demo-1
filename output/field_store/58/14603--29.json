THE CHAUTAUQUA MANAGERS' ASSOCIATION,                                          ORCHESTRA BUILDING, CHICAGO.      Chas. W. Ferguson, Pres.                       A. L. Flude, Sec'y.          PREFACE      This narrative has been prepared as a general outline of my conquest of  the North Pole. In it the scientific data, the observations, every phase  of the pioneer work with its drain of human energy has been presented in  its proper relation to a strange cycle of events. The camera has been  used whenever possible to illustrate the progress of the expedition as  well as the wonders and mysteries of the Arctic wilds. Herein, with due  after-thought and the better perspective afforded by time, the rough  field notes, the disconnected daily tabulations and the records of  instrumental observations, every fact, every optical and mental  impression, has been re-examined and re-arranged to make a concise  record of successive stages of progress to the boreal center. If I have  thus worked out an understandable panorama of our environment, then the  mission of this book has served its purpose.    Much has been said about absolute geographic proof of an explorer's  work. History demonstrates that the book which gives the final  authoritative narrative is the test of an explorer's claims. By it every  traveler has been measured. From the time of the discovery of America to  the piercing of darkest Africa and the opening of Thibet, men who have  sought the truth of the claims of discovery have sought, not abstract  figures, but the continuity of the narrative in the pages of the  traveler's final book. In such a narrative, after due digestion and  assimilation, there is to be found either the proof or the disproof of  the claims of a discoverer.    In such narratives as the one herewith presented, subsequent travelers  and other experts, with no other interests to serve except those of fair  play, have critically examined the material. With the lapse of time  accordingly, when partisanship feelings have been merged in calm and  conscientious judgment, history has always finally pronounced a fair and  equitable verdict.    In a similar way my claim of being first to reach the North Pole will  rest upon the data presented between the covers of this book.    In working out the destiny of this Expedition, and this book which  records its doings, I have to acknowledge my gratitude for the  assistance of many people. First among those to whom I am deeply  indebted is John R. Bradley. By his liberal hand this Expedition was  given life, and by his loyal support and helpfulness I was enabled to  get to my base of operations at Annoatok. By his liberal donations of  food we were enabled to live comfortably during the first year. To John  R. Bradley, therefore, belong the first fruits of the Polar conquest.    A tribute of praise must be placed on record for Rudolph Francke. After  the yacht returned, he was my sole civilized helper and companion. The  faithful manner in which he performed the difficult duties assigned to  him, and his unruffled cheerfulness during the trying weeks of the long  night, reflect a large measure of credit.    The band of little people of the Farthest North furnished without pay  the vital force and the primitive ingenuity without which the quest of  the Pole would be a hopeless task. These boreal pigmies with golden  skins, with muscles of steel, and hearts as finely human as those of the  highest order of man, performed a task that cannot be too highly  commended. The two boys, Ah-we-lah and E-tuk-i-shook, deserve a place on  the tablet of fame. They followed me with a perseverance which  demonstrates one of the finest qualities of savage life. They shared  with me the long run of hardship; they endured without complaint the  unsatisfied hunger, the unquenched thirst, and the maddening isolation,  with no thought of reward except that which comes from an unselfish  desire to follow one whom they chose to regard as a friend. If a noble  deed was ever accomplished, these boys did it, and history should record  their heroic effort with indelible ink.    At the request of Mrs. Cook, the Canadian Government sent its ship, the  \"Arctic,\" under Captain Bernier, with supplementary supplies for me, to  Etah. These were left under the charge of Mr. Harry Whitney. The return  to civilization was made in comfort, by the splendid manner in which  this difficult problem was carried out. To each and all in this  combination I am deeply indebted.    With sweet memories of the warm hospitality of Danes in Greenland, I  here subscribe my never-to-be-forgotten appreciation. I am also indebted  to the Royal Greenland Trading Company and to the United S. S. Company  for many favors; and, above all, am I grateful to the Danes as a nation,  for the whole-souled demonstrations of friendship and appreciation at  Copenhagen.    In the making of this book, I was relieved of much routine editorial  work by Mr. T. Everett Harry, associate editor of Hampton's Magazine,  who rearranged much of my material, and by whose handling of certain  purely adventure matter a book of better literary workmanship has been  made.    I am closing the pages of this book with a good deal of regret, for, in  the effort to make the price of this volume so low that it can go into  every home, the need for brevity has dictated the number of pages. My  last word to all--to friends and enemies--is, if you must pass judgment,  study the problem carefully. You are as capable of forming a correct  judgment as the self-appointed experts. One of Peary's captains has said  \"that he knew, but never would admit, that Peary did not reach the  Pole.\" Rear Admiral Chester has said the same about me, but he \"admits\"  it in big, flaming type. With due respect to these men, in justice to  the cause, I am bound to say that these, and others of their kind, who  necessarily have a blinding bias, are not better able to judge than the  average American citizen.    If you have read this book, then read Mr. Peary's \"North Pole.\" Put the  two books side by side. When making comparisons, remember that my  attainment of the Pole was one year earlier than Mr. Peary's claim; that  my narrative was written and printed months before that of Mr. Peary;  that the Peary narrative is such that Rear Admiral Schley has  said--\"After reading the published accounts daily and critically of  both claimants, I was forced to the conclusion from their striking  similarity that each of you was the eye-witness of the other's success.  Without collusion, it would have been impossible to have written  accounts so similar.\"    This opinion, coming as it does from one of the highest Arctic and Naval  authorities, is endorsed by practically all Arctic explorers. Captain E.  B. Baldwin goes even further, and proves my claim from the pages of  Peary's own book. Governor Brown of Georgia, after a critical  examination of the two reports, says, \"If it is true, as Peary would  like us to believe, that Cook has given us a gold brick, then Peary has  offered a paste diamond.\"    Since my account was written and printed first, the striking analogy  apparent in the Peary pages either proves my position at the Pole or it  convicts Peary of using my data to fill out and impart verisimilitude to  his own story of a second victory.    Much against my will I find myself compelled to uncover the dark pages  of the selfish unfairness of rival interests. In doing so my aim is not  to throw doubt and distrust on Mr. Peary's success, but to show his  incentive and his methods in attempting to leave the sting of discredit  upon me. I would prefer to close my eye to a long series of wrong doings  as I have done in the passing years, but the Polar controversy cannot be  understood unless we get the perspective of the man who has forced it.  Heretofore I have allowed others to expend their argumentative  ammunition. The questions which I have raised are minor points. On the  main question of Polar attainment there is not now room for doubt. The  Pole has been honestly reached--the American Eagle has spread its wings  of glory over the world's top. Whether there is room for one or two or  more under those wings, I am content to let the future decide.                                                      FREDERICK A. COOK.

Chaffinches are taken in nooses among  the corn, as are larks and buntings. Crisp cresses from the springs  constitute an important source of income, and the embrowned nuts of  autumn a harvest in themselves. It is during his early days of working  upon the land that the erstwhile poacher learns of the rain-bringing  tides; of the time of migration of birds; of the evening gamboling of  hares; of the coming together of the partridge to roost; of the spawning  of salmon and trout; and a hundred other scraps of knowledge which will  serve him in good stead in his subsequent protest against the Game Laws.    [Illustration]    Almost every young rustic who develops into a poacher has some such  outdoor education as that sketched above. He has about him much ready  animal ingenuity, and is capable of almost infinite resource. His snares  and lines are constructed with his pocket knife, out of material he  finds ready to hand in the woods. He early learns to imitate the call of  the game birds, so accurately as to deceive even the birds themselves;  and his weather-stained clothes seem to take on themselves the duns and  browns and olives of the woods. A child brought up in the lap of Nature  is invariably deeply marked with her impress, and we shall see to what  end she has taught him.          [Illustration]    Chapter 2.    UNDER THE NIGHT.        Now came still evening on, and twilight gray      Had in her sober liv'ry all things clad.      When the embryo poacher has once tasted the forbidden fruits of the  land--and it matters not if his game be but field-mice and  squirrels--there is only one thing wanting to win him completely to  Nature's ways. This is that he shall see her sights and hear her sounds  under the night. There is a charm about the night side of nature that  the town dweller can never know. I have been once in London, and well  remember what, as a country lad, impressed me most. It was the fact that  I had, during the small hours of the morning, stood alone on London  Bridge. The great artery of life was still; the pulse of the city had  ceased to beat. Not a moving object was visible. Although bred among the  lonely hills, I felt for the first time that this was to be alone; that  this was solitude. I felt such a sense as Macaulay's New Zealander may  experience when he sits upon the ruins of the same stupendous structure;  and it was then for the first time I knew whence the inspiration, and  felt the full force and realism of a line I had heard, \"O God! the very  houses seemed to sleep.\" I could detect no definite sound, only that  vague and distant hum that for ever haunts and hangs over a great city.  Then my thoughts flew homeward (to the fells and upland fields, to the  cold mists by the river, to the deep and sombre woods). I had never  observed such a time of quiet there; no absolute and general period of  repose. There was always something abroad, some creature of the fields  or woods, which by its voice or movements was betrayed. Just as in an  old rambling house there are always strange noises that cannot be  accounted for, so in the night-paths of nature there are innumerable  sounds which can never be localised. To those, however, who pursue night  avocations in the country, there are always calls and cries which  bespeak life as animate under the night as that of the day. This is  attributable to various animals and birds, to beetles, to night-flying  insects, even to fish; and part of the education of the young poacher is  to track these sounds to their source.    [Illustration]    I have said that our family was a family of poachers. The old instinct  was in us all, though I believe that the same wild spirit which drove  us to the moor and covert at night was only the same as was strongly  implanted in the breast of Lord ----, our neighbour, who was a  legitimate sportsman and a Justice of the Peace. If we were not allowed  to see much real poaching when we were young we saw a good deal of the  preparations for it. As the leaves began to turn in autumn there was  great activity in our old home among nets and snares. When wind and  feather were favourable, late afternoon brought home my father, and his  wires and nets were already spread on the clean sanded floor. There was  a peg to sharpen, or a broken mesh to mend. Every now and then he would  look out on the darkening night, always directing his glance upward. The  two dogs would whine impatiently to be gone, and in an hour, with bulky  pockets, he would start, striking right across the land and away from  the high road. The dogs would prick out their ears on the track, but  stuck doggedly to his heels; and then, as we watched, the darkness would  blot him out of the landscape, and we turned with our mother to the  fireside. In summer we saw little but the \"breaking\" of the lurchers.  These dogs take long to train, but, when perfected, are invaluable. All  the best lurchers are the produce of a cross between the sheep-dog and  greyhound, a combination which secures the speed and silence of the one,  and the \"nose\" of the other. From the batches of puppies we always saved  such as were rough-coated, as these were better able to stand the  exposure of long, cold nights. In colour the best are fawn or  brown--some shade which assimilates well to the duns and browns and  yellows of the fields and woods; but our extended knowledge of the dogs  came in after years.    [Illustration]    The oak gun-rack in our old home contained a motley collection of  fowling pieces, mostly with the barrels filed down. This was that the  pieces might be more conveniently stowed away in the pocket until it was  policy to have them out. The guns showed every graduation in age, size,  and make, and among them was an old flint-lock which had been in the  family for generations. This heirloom was often surreptitiously stolen  away, and then we were able to bring down larger game. Wood pigeons were  waited for in the larches, and shot as they came to roost. The crakes  were called by the aid of a small \"crank,\" and shot as they emerged from  the lush summer grass. Large numbers of green plover were bagged from  time to time, and often in winter we had a chance at their grey cousins,  the whistling species. Both these fed in the water-meadows through  winter, and the former were always abundant. In spring, \"trips\" of rare  dotterel often led us about the higher hills for days, and sometimes we  had to stay all night on the mountain. Then we were up with the first  gray light in the morning, and generally managed to bring down a few  birds. The feathers of these are extremely valuable for fishing, and my  father invariably supplied them to the county justices who lived near  us. He trained a dog to hunt dotterel, and so find their nests, and in  this was most successful--more so than an eminent naturalist who spent  five consecutive summers about the summits of our highest mountains,  though without ever coming across a nest or seeing the birds. Sometimes  we bagged a gaunt heron as it flapped heavily from a ditch--a greater  fish poacher than any in the country side. One of our great resorts on  winter evenings was to an island which bordered a disused mill-dam. This  was thickly covered with aquatic vegetation, and to it came teal,  mallard, and poachard. All through the summer we had worked assiduously  at a small \"dug-out,\" and in this we waited, snugly stowed away behind a  willow root. When the ducks appeared on the sky-line the old flint-lock  was out, a sharp report tore the darkness, and a brace of teal or  mallard floated down stream, and on to the mill island. In this way half  a dozen ducks would be bagged, and, dead or dying, they were left where  they fell, and retrieved next morning. Sometimes big game was obtained  in the shape of a brace of geese, which proved themselves the least wary  of a flock; but these only came in the severest weather.    [Illustration]    Cutting the coppice, assisting the charcoal burners, or helping the old  woodman--all gave facilities for observing the habits of game, and none  of these opportunities were missed. In this way we were brought right  into the heart of the land, and our evil genius was hardly suspected. An  early incident in the woods is worth recording. I have already said that  we took snipe and woodcock by means of \"gins\" and \"springes,\" and one  morning on going to examine a snare, we discovered a large buzzard near  one which was \"struck.\" The bird endeavoured to escape, but, being  evidently held fast, could not. A woodcock had been taken in one of our  snares, which, while fluttering, had been seen and attacked by the  buzzard. Not content, however, with the body of the woodcock, it had  swallowed a leg also, around which the nooze was drawn, and the limb was  so securely lodged in its stomach that no force which the bird could  exert could withdraw it. The gamekeepers would employ us to take  hedgehogs, which we did in steel traps baited with eggs. These prickly  little animals were justly blamed for robbing pheasants' nests, and many  a one paid the penalty for so doing. We received so much per head for  the capture of these, as also for moles which tunnelled the banks of  the water meadows. Being injurious to the stream sides and the young  larches, the farmers were anxious to rid these; and one summer we  received a commission to exercise our knowledge of field-craft against  them. But in the early days our greatest successes were among the sea  ducks and wildfowl which haunted the marram-covered flats and ooze banks  of an inland bay a few miles from our home. Mention of our capturing the  sea birds brings to mind some very early rabbit poaching. At dusk the  rabbits used to come down from the woods, and on to the sandy saline  tracts to nibble the short sea grass. As twilight came we used to lie"]]]
