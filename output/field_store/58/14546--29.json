[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#2)"],[1,"of the Arab prophet. We must, in order to do him justice, give  full consideration to his temperament and to the condition of things around  him. We are here in touch with an untutored but fervent mind, trying to  realise itself and to assimilate certain great truths which have been  powerfully borne in upon him, in order to impart them in a convincing form to  his fellow-tribesmen. He is surrounded by obstacles of every kind, yet he  manfully struggles on with the message that is within him. Learning he has  none, or next to none. His chief objects of knowledge are floating stories  and traditions largely picked up from hearsay, and his over-wrought mind is  his only teacher. The literary compositions to which he had ever listened  were the half-cultured, yet often wildly powerful rhapsodies of early Arabian  minstrels, akin to Ossian rather than to anything else within our knowledge.  What wonder then that his Koran took a form which to our colder temperaments  sounds strange, unbalanced, and fantastic?    Yet the Moslems themselves consider the book the finest that ever appeared  among men. They find no incongruity in the style. To them the matter is all  true and the manner all perfect. Their eastern temperament responds readily  to the crude, strong, and wild appeal which its cadences make to them, and  the jingling rhyme in which the sentences of a discourse generally end adds  to the charm of the whole. The Koran, even if viewed from the point of view  of style alone, was to them from the first nothing less than a miracle, as  great a miracle as ever was wrought.    But to return to our own view of the case. Our difficulty in appreciating the  style of the Koran even moderately is, of course, increased if, instead of  the original, we have a translation before us. But one is happy to be able to  say that Rodwell's rendering is one of the best that have as yet been  produced. It seems to a great extent to carry with it the atmosphere in which  Muhammed lived, and its sentences are imbued with the flavour of the East.  The quasi-verse form, with its unfettered and irregular rhythmic flow of the  lines, which has in suitable cases been adopted, helps to bring out much of  the wild charm of the Arabic. Not the least among its recommendations is,  perhaps, that it is scholarly without being pedantic that is to say, that it  aims at correctness without sacrificing the right effect of the whole to  over-insistence on small details.    Another important merit of Rodwell's edition is its chronological arrangement  of the Suras or chapters. As he tells us himself in his preface, it is now in  a number of cases impossible to ascertain the exact occasion on which a  discourse, or part of a discourse, was delivered, so that the system could  not be carried through with entire consistency. But the sequence adopted is  in the main based on the best available historical and literary evidence; and  in following the order of the chapters as here printed, the reader will be  able to trace the development of the prophet's mind as he gradually advanced  from the early flush of inspiration to the less spiritual and more equivocal  r\\oc\\le of warrior, politician, and founder of an empire.

LATE CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW ZEALAND,    THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED,    WITH SINCERE FEELINGS OF ESTEEM FOR HIS PRIVATE WORTH,    PUBLIC SERVICES,    AND EMINENT LITERARY ATTAINMENTS,    BY        THE TRANSLATOR.        PREFACE    It is necessary that some brief explanation should be given with reference to  the arrangement of the Suras, or chapters, adopted in this translation of the  Koran. It should be premised that their order as it stands in all Arabic  manuscripts, and in all hitherto printed editions, whether Arabic or  European, is not chronological, neither is there any authentic tradition to  shew that it rests upon the authority of Muhammad himself. The scattered  fragments of the Koran were in the first instance collected by his immediate  successor Abu Bekr, about a year after the Prophet's death, at the suggestion  of Omar, who foresaw that, as the Muslim warriors, whose memories were the  sole depositaries of large portions of the revelations, died off or were  slain, as had been the case with many in the battle of Yemâma, A.H. 12, the  loss of the greater part, or even of the whole, was imminent. Zaid Ibn  Thâbit, a native of Medina, and one of the Ansars, or helpers, who had been  Muhammad's amanuensis, was the person fixed upon to carry out the task, and  we are told that he \"gathered together\" the fragments of the Koran from every  quarter, \"from date leaves and tablets of white stone, and from the breasts  of men.\"1 The copy thus formed by Zaid probably remained in the possession of  Abu Bekr during the remainder of his brief caliphate, who committed it to the  custody of Haphsa, one of Muhammad's widows, and this text continued during  the ten years of Omar's caliphate to be the standard. In the copies made from  it, various readings naturally and necessarily sprung up; and these, under  the caliphate of Othman, led to such serious disputes between the faithful,  that it became necessary to interpose, and in accordance with the warning of  Hodzeifa, \"to stop the people, before they should differ regarding their  scriptures, as did the Jews and Christians.\"2 In accordance with this advice,  Othman determined to establish a text which should be the sole standard, and  entrusted the redaction to the Zaid already mentioned, with whom he  associated as colleagues, three, according to others, twelve3 of the  Koreisch, in order to secure the purity of that Meccan idiom in which  Muhammad had spoken, should any occasions arise in which the collators might  have to decide upon various readings. Copies of the text formed were thus  forwarded to several of the chief military stations in the new empire, and  all previously existing copies were committed to the flames.    Zaid and his coadjutors, however, do not appear to have arranged the  materials which came into their hands upon any system more definite than that  of placing the longest and best known Suras first, immediately after the  Fatthah, or opening chapter (the eighth in this edition); although even this  rule, artless and unscientific as it is, has not been adhered to with  strictness. Anything approaching to a chronological arrangement was entirely  lost sight of. Late Medina Suras are often placed before early Meccan Suras;  the short Suras at the end of the Koran are its earliest portions; while, as  will be seen from the notes, verses of Meccan origin are to be found embedded  in Medina Suras, and verses promulged at Medina scattered up and down in the  Meccan Suras. It would seem as if Zaid had to a great extent put his  materials together just as they came to hand, and often with entire disregard  to continuity of subject and uniformity of style. The text, therefore, as  hitherto arranged, necessarily assumes the form of a most unreadable and  incongruous patchwork; \"une assemblage,\" says M. Kasimirski in his Preface,  \"informe et incohérent de préceptes moraux, religieux, civils et politiques,  mêlés d'exhortations, de promesses, et de menaces\"and conveys no idea  whatever of the development and growth of any plan in the mind of the founder  of Islam, or of the circumstances by which he was surrounded and influenced.  It is true that the manner in which Zaid contented himself with simply  bringing together his materials and transcribing them, without any attempt to  mould them into shape or sequence, and without any effort to supply  connecting links between adjacent verses, to fill up obvious chasms, or to  suppress details of a nature discreditable to the founder of Islam, proves  his scrupulous honesty as a compiler, as well as his reverence for the sacred  text, and to a certain extent guarantees the genuineness and authenticity of  the entire volume. But it is deeply to be regretted that he did not combine  some measure of historical criticism with that simplicity and honesty of  purpose which forbade him, as it certainly did, in any way to tamper with the  sacred text, to suppress contradictory, and exclude or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34353"],[0,"The Forest Habitat of the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation (#2)"],[1,"toward hotter  and drier conditions, or a change in native practices, with more  frequent burning, might have brought about the trend.    Further information concerning the distribution and composition of the  forest is afforded by a series of letters from the settlers at  Lawrence, Kansas, that were printed in various Boston newspapers and  in the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel, in 1854, 1855, and 1856. In nine such  letters which discuss, among other things, the availability of timber,  several kinds of trees are listed. Oak (species not mentioned), black  walnut, and cottonwood are each listed in seven of the nine letters,  while elm, hickory and \"white walnut\" are each listed in two, and ash,  hackberry, sycamore, basswood, willow and locust are each mentioned  only once. Copies of these letters are in the files of Dr. James C.  Malin, to whom we are much indebted for the privilege of examining  them, and for his critical reading of parts of the manuscript.    Early U. S. Government maps of northeastern Kansas show the  distribution of forest in the late eighteen fifties, and in general  the pattern agrees well with that indicated by the accounts of Parks  and Robinson. Through the kindness of Dr. Malin, we have been  permitted to examine his photostatic copies of a series of these early  maps, covering the area discussed in our study, and made in the  period extending from 1855 through 1860. A tracing taken from parts of  two of these maps, showing the Kansas River north and east of  Lawrence, and the area between the river and the north boundary of  Douglas County, is reproduced in Fig. 1. For comparison, a map of the  same area showing the stream courses and the distribution of timber,  as traced from recent U. S. Geological Survey maps, is reproduced in  Fig. 2.    The early maps agree with Parks' and Robinson's descriptions in  showing an extensive belt of timber in the flood plain north of the  river, and narrower belts of timber along its tributary streams. In  Fig. 1 the courses of the Kansas River and of Mud Creek agree fairly  well with those shown on modern maps, but there are gross errors in  the minor drainage systems of the sections of land in the northeastern  part. Other evidence indicates that the distribution of forest was  much different than that shown in this part of the map. Field work by  the map-makers in this marginal area must have been extremely sketchy.  Dr. Malin explains that such inaccuracies are to be expected because  the contracts for mapping were made on a political basis, with little  or no regard for other qualifications of the applicant.    The University of Kansas Natural History Reservation is in the  northeasternmost section (Section 4, Township 12S, Range 20E) of  Douglas County, Kansas. Topographically, it is almost evenly divided  into three parts: (1) peninsular extensions of the Kansas River  Valley, sloping gradually up to a level approximately 100 feet above  that of the flood plain; (2) hilltops 200 feet or more above the level  of the flood plain; (3) steep slopes from the hilltops to the valley  floor.    The land that is now the Reservation was part of a tract acquired in  the eighteen sixties by former governor Charles Robinson, after the  Delaware Reserve lands in the northeastern part of Kansas Territory  were sold by the tribe. The section of land now comprising the  Reservation was used primarily for grazing after Robinson acquired it.  However, several squatters settled on the area and cultivated small  acreages for periods of years in the eighteen seventies and eighteen  eighties. In the eighteen nineties parts of the area including some of  the hillsides were still covered with a mixed forest of virgin timber  (_fide_ Frank H. Leonhard in conversation, October 19, 1951). Mr.  Leonhard, who was long in the employ of the Charles Robinson family,  remembered the area as far back as the early eighteen nineties when he  worked on it cutting timber. He remembered, especially, cutting large  walnut trees as much as two feet in diameter, which were valuable  timber, but he thought that elm also was abundant at that time. By  then the area, separated into east and west halves by a rock wall, had  already been heavily grazed, and the original prairie vegetation,  presumably dominated by big bluestem, had been much altered. The open  upland portions were dominated by blue grass.      [Illustration: Fig. 1. Tracing from early (1855-60) U. S.        Government maps of northeastern Douglas County, Kansas, and        adjacent western edge of Leavenworth County, showing stream        courses and approximate distribution of woodland before        deforestation had occurred.

Tracing from 1950 U.S. Geological Survey        maps of same area shown in Fig. 1, indicating present        distribution of woodland, and the pattern of drainage systems.]    By about 1900 control of the area had passed to the J. F. Morgan  family. The homesteads had long since been deserted and the entire  area was used for grazing (_fide_ J. F. Morgan, in conversation,  January 13, 1952). Parts of the bottomland were fenced and broken for  cultivation in 1907, 1912, and 1915, and hilltop fields were first  cultivated in 1909. Tree cutting was more or less continual. Many of  the old stumps still present on the area are remnants of the trees cut  in the \"twenties\" or even earlier. Several acres of hilltop and south  slope in the northwest corner of the area were protected from  livestock and maintained for harvesting of prairie hay. The hay was  mowed annually, and the vegetation was burned at less frequent  intervals, usually in early spring. This treatment served to kill  encroaching woody vegetation and to maintain a prairie type.    In the mid-thirties control of the area passed to the University of  Kansas. At that time a program of development was launched by the  University and the U. S. Soil Conservation Service with relief labor  (_fide_ C. G. Bayles in conversation, November 10, 1953). The work  included: filling gullies, digging diversion ditches and building  check dams and terraces to prevent erosion; clearing extensive  thickets; bindweed eradication from the cultivated areas; and fencing  off the wooded hillsides from the valley and hilltop pastures for  protection from livestock. This work extended over several years, and  one main objective was to utilize the area for growing timber.  However, plans to make extensive plantings of walnut and other  valuable timber never materialized. In the forties the check dams fell  into disrepair. The area was leased to a farmer and was again heavily  overgrazed. In this period there was some tree-cutting by the  University's Department of Buildings and Grounds and by farmers, but  this cutting was not on a commercial scale and was mainly for firewood  and fence posts. One of the chief results of fencing off the wooded  hillsides was that shrubs and young trees, formerly held in check by  livestock, were allowed to flourish. Understory thickets sprang up  throughout most of the woodland, and especially in edge situations.    Late in 1948, after the area had been made a Reservation, livestock  were excluded. In the years following, the parts of the closely grazed  pastures adjacent to woodland passed through stages similar to those  that had occurred 10 to 12 years earlier in the parts protected by  fences. Young trees and shrubs sprang up in thickets, the numbers and  kinds depending on amount of shade, seed sources, soil, moisture, and  various other factors.    Although most of the tree-cutting was done prior to 1934, annual  growth rings are discernible on many of the old stumps, indicating the  age of the tree at the time it was cut. Occasionally the stumps  produced sprouts which had grown into sizable trees by 1954. In such  instances the year that the tree was cut and the year that it  originally began growing could be determined from a study of the  annual growth rings. In 54 instances ring counts were obtained from  stumps or logs, or from trees that had been split and fallen in wind  storms.    Stumps that were otherwise intact often had small central cavities an  inch or more in diameter. For these it was necessary to estimate the  numbers of missing rings in order to obtain a figure for the  approximate total age of the tree at the time it was cut. Many of the  logs and stumps were so much decayed that growth rings were no longer  distinct, and on most there were a few rings that were not clearly  defined. In the majority of instances the time of cutting could not be  determined accurately, but it is known that there was little  tree-cutting after 1934 on most parts of the area. Probably most of  the stumps on the Reservation that were well enough preserved to  provide counts were from 20 to 30 years old. Most of the counts of  growth rings on chestnut oaks were obtained on a hillside adjoining  the Reservation where the trees were cut in the early nineteen  forties.    Width of the annual growth rings reflects rapidity of growth in the  tree and is determined, in part, by the amount of annual rainfall,  especially in this region on the western edge of the deciduous forests  where moisture is the chief limiting factor. Periods of drought or of  unusually heavy rainfall may result in growth rings smaller or larger  than average. Because the trees draw moisture from the deeper soil  layer there is a lag in their response to precipitation, and a single  year that is much wetter or much drier than those preceding or  following it may not stand out clearly in the annual rings. In  individual trees the effect of precipitation is often obscured by the  effects of crowding "]]]
