But perhaps they made a mistake in the  spelling.  The blessed Fathers themselves teach us that the best  holiness lacks education.'    Madonna laughed out a little.  'This is a very good fool!' she murmured,  and yawned.    'I don't know about that,' said Lanti, answering the landlord, and  wagging his sage head.  'I'm not the most pious of men myself.  But tell  us, sirrah, how travels his innocence?'    'On foot, my lord, like a prophet's.'    ''Twill the sooner lie prone.'  He turned to my lady. 'Wouldst like to  add him to Cicada and thy monkey, and carry him along with us?'    'Nay,' she said pettishly, 'I have enough of monstrosities. Will you  keep me in the sun all day?'    'Well,' said Lanti, gathering his reins, 'it puzzles me only how the  Abbot could part thus with his discretion.'    'Nay, Illustrious,' answered the landlord, 'he was in a grievous pet,  'tis stated.  But, there! prophecy will no more be denied than love.  A'  must out or kill.  And so he had to let Messer Bembo go his gaits with a  letter only to this monastery and that, in providence of a sanctuary,  and one even, 'tis whispered, to the good Duchess Bona herself.  But  here, by the token, he comes.'    He bowed deferentially, backing apart.  Messer Lanti stared, and gave a  profound whistle.    'O, indeed!' he muttered, showing his strong teeth, 'this Giuseppe  propagates the faith very prettily!'    Madam Beatrice was staring too.  She expressed no further impatience to  be gone for the moment.  A young man, followed by some kitchen company  adoring and obsequious, had come out by the door, and stood regarding  her quietly.  She had expected some apparition of austerity, some lean,  neurotic friar, wasting between dogmatism and sensuality.  And instead  she saw an angel of the breed that wrestled with Jacob.    He was so much a child in appearance, with such an aspect of wonder and  prettiness, that the first motion of her heart towards him was like the  leap of motherhood. Then she laughed, with a little dye come to her  cheek, and eyed him over the screen of feathers she held in her hand.    He advanced into the sunlight.    'Greeting, sweet Madonna,' he said, in his grave young voice, 'and fair  as your face be your way!' and he was offering to pass her.    She could only stare, the bold jade, at a loss for an answer.  The soft  umber eyes of the youth looked into hers.  They were round and velvety  as a rabbit's, with high, clean-pencilled brows over.  His nose was  short and pretty broad at the bridge, and his mouth was a little mouth,  pouting as a child's, something combative, and with lips like tinted  wax.  Like a girl's his jaw was round and beardless, and his hair a  golden fleece, cut square at the neck, and its ends brittle as if they  had been singed in fire.  His doublet and hose were of palest pink; his  bonnet, shoes, and mantlet of cypress-green velvet.  Rose-coloured  ribbons, knotted into silver buckles, adorned his feet; and over his  shoulder, pendent from a strand of the same hue, was slung a fair lute.  He could not have passed, by his looks, his sixteenth summer.    Lanti pushed rudely forward.    'A moment, saint troubadour, a moment!' he cried. 'It will please us,  hearing of your mission, to have a taste of your quality.'    The youth, looking at him a little, swung his lute forward and smiled.    'What would you have, gracious sir?' he said.    'What?  Why, prophesy us our case in parable.'    'I know not your name nor calling.'    'A pretty prophet, forsooth.  But I will enlighten thee. I am Carlo  Lanti, gentleman of the Duke, and this fair lady the wife of him we call  the Count of Casa Caprona.'    The boy frowned a little, then nodded and touched the strings.  And all  in a moment he was improvising the strangest ditty, a sort of cantefable  between prose and song:--        'A lord of little else possessed a jewel,      Of his small state incomparably the crown.      But he, going on a journey once,      To his wife committed it, saying,      \"This trust with you I pledge till my return;      See, by your love, that I redeem my trust.\"      But she, when he was gone, thinking \"he will not know,\"      Procured its exact fellow in green glass,      And sold her lord's gem to one who bid her fair;      Then, conscience-haunted, wasted all those gains      Secretly, without enjoyment, lest he should hear and wonder.      But he returning, she gave him the bauble,      And, deceived, he commended her; and, shortly after, dying,      Left her that precious jewel for all dower,      Bequeathing elsewhere the residue of his estate.      Now, was not this lady very well served,      Inheriting the whole value, as she had appraised it,      Of her lord's dearest possession?      Gentles, Dishonour is a poor estate.'      Half-chaunting, half-talking, to an accompaniment of soft-touched  chords, he ended with a little shrug of abandonment, and dropped the  lute from his fingers. His voice had been small and low, but pure; the  sweet thrum of the strings had lifted it to rhapsody.  Messer Lanti  scratched his head.    'Well, if that is a parable!' he puzzled.  'But supposing it aims at our  case, why--Casa Caprona is neither poor nor dead; and as to a jewel----'    He looked at Madam Beatrice, who was frowning and biting her lip.    'Why heed the peevish stuff?' she said.  'Will you come?  I am sick to  be moving.'    Carlo was suddenly illuminated.    'O, to be sure, of course!' he ejaculated--'the jewel----'    'Hold your tongue!' cried the lady sharply.    The honest blockhead went into a roar of laughter.    'He has touched thee, he has touched thee!  And these are his means to  convert the Duke!  By Saint Ambrose, 'twill be a game to watch!  I swear  he shall go with us.'    'Not with my consent,' cried madam.    Carlo, chuckling tormentingly, looked at her, then doffed his cap  mockingly to the boy.    'Sweet Messer Bembo,' he said, 'I take your lesson much to heart, and  pray you gratefully--as we are both for Milan, I understand--to give us  the honour of your company thither.  I am in good standing with the  Duke, I say, and you would lose nothing by having a friend at court.  Those half-boots'--he glanced at the pretty pumps--'could as ill afford  the penalties of the road as your innocence its dangers.'    'I have no more fear than my divine Master,' said the boy boldly, 'in  carrying His gospel of love.'    'Well for you,' said Carlo, with a grin of approval for his spirit; 'but  a gospel that goes in silken doublet and lovelocks is like to be struck  dumb before it is uttered.'    'As to my condition, sir,' said the boy, 'I dress as for a feast, our  Master having prepared the board.  Are we not redeemed and invited?  We  walk in joy since the Resurrection, and Limbo is emptied of its gloom.  The kingdom of man shall be love, and the government thereof.  Preach  heresy in rags.  'Twas the Lord Abbot equipped me thus, my own stout  heart prevailing. \"Well, they will encounter an angel walking by the  road,\" quoth he, \"and, if they doubt, show 'em thy white shoulder-knobs,  little Bernardino, and they will see the wings sprouting underneath like  the teeth in a baby's gums.\"'    He was evidently, if sage or lunatic, an amazing child. The rough  libertine was quite captivated by him.    'Well, you will come with us, Bernardino?' said he; 'for with a cracked  skull it might go hard with you to prove your shoulder-blades.'    'I will come, lord, to reap the harvest where I have sowed the grain.'    He looked with a serene severity at the countess.    'Shalt take thee pillion, Beatrice,' shouted Lanti.  'Up, pretty  troubadour, and recount her more parables by the way.'    'May I die but he shall not,' cried the girl.    'He shall, I say.'    'I will bite, and rake him with my nails.'    'The more fool you, to spoil a saint!  Reproofs come not often in such a  guise as this.  Up, Bernardino, and parable her into submission!'    She made a show of resisting, in the midst of which Bembo won to his  place deftly on the fore-saddle.  At the moment of his success, the fool  Cicada sprang from the tavern door, and, lurching with wild, glazed  eyes, leapt, hooting, upon the crupper of the beast, almost bringing it  upon its haunches.  With an oath Lanti brought down his whip with such  fury that the fool rolled in the dust.    'Drunken dog!' he roared, and would have ridden over the writhing body,  had not Bembo backed the white palfrey to prevent him.    'Thou strik'st the livery, not the man!' he cried. 'Hast never thyself  been drunk, and without the excuse of this poor fool to make a trade of  folly?'    Messer Lanti glared, then in a moment laughed.  The battered grasshopper  took advantage of the diversion to rise and slink to the rear.  The next  moment the whole cavalcade was in motion.                                        *CHAPTER II*      They travelled on till sundown through the green plains; and, for one  good hour dating from their start, not a word would Madam Beatrice  utter.  Then she gave out--Messer Carlo being a distance in advance--but  with no grace at all.    'You are an ill horseman, Saint.  I am near jogged from my seat.'    'Put thine arms about me.'    'Nay, I am not holy enough.'    She was silent again, for five minutes.    'Your lute bangs my nose.'    He shifted it.  She held her peace during two minutes.    'Who taught you to play it, Saint?'    'It was one of the fathers.  What would it profit you to know which?'    'Nothing at all.  I trow he was a good master to that and your gospel.'    'My gospel?'    'Ay, of love.  He has made you worldly-wise for a saint.  Hast ever  before been beyond thy walls?'    'Of course.'    'And studied this and that?  Experience, methinks is the right nurse for  such a creed."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],[0,"Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#2)"],[1,"                 72      Hair dressing in the sixteenth century.
