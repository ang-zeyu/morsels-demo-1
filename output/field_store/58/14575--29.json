[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3535"],[0,"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany-Bay (#2)"],[1," recruited since the war  been sent out, sea-sickness would have incapacitated half the men from  performing the duties immediately and indispensably necessary; whereas  the marines, from being accustomed to serve on board ship, accommodated  themselves with ease to every exigency, and surmounted every difficulty.    At daybreak, on the morning of the 30th of May we saw the rocks named  the Deserters, which lie off the south-east end of Madeira; and found  the south-east extremity of the most southerly of them, to be in the  latitude of 32 deg 28 min north, longitude 16 deg 17 1/2 min west of  Greenwich. The following day we saw the Salvages, a cluster of rocks  which are placed between the Madeiras and Canary Islands, and determined  the latitude of the middle of the Great Salvage to be 30 deg 12 min  north, and the longitude of its eastern side to be 15 deg 39 min west.  It is no less extraordinary than unpardonable, that in some very modern  charts of the Atlantic, published in London, the Salvages are totally  omitted.    We made the island of Teneriffe on the 3d of June, and in the evening  anchored in the road of Santa Cruz, after an excellent passage of three  weeks from the day we left England.          CHAPTER III.        From the Fleet's Arrival at Teneriffe, to its Departure for Rio de  Janeiro, in the Brazils.      There is little to please a traveller at Teneriffe. He has heard wonders  of its celebrated Peak, but he may remain for weeks together at the town  of Santa Cruz without having a glimpse of it, and when its cloud-topped  head emerges, the chance is, that he feels disappointed, for, from the  point of view in which he sees it, the neighbouring mountains lessen its  effect very considerably. Excepting the Peak, the eye receives little  pleasure from the general face of the country, which is sterile and  uninviting to the last degree. The town, however, from its cheerful  white appearance, contrasted with the dreary brownness of the back  ground, makes not an unpleasing coup d'oeil. It is neither irregular in  its plan, nor despicable in its style of building; and the churches and  religious houses are numerous, sumptuous, and highly ornamented.    The morning of our arrival, as many officers as could be spared from the  different ships were introduced to the Marquis de Brancifort, Governor  of the Canary Islands, whose reception was highly flattering and polite.  His Excellency is a Sicilian by birth, and is most deservedly popular in  his government. He prefers residing at Teneriffe, for the conveniency  of frequent communication with Europe, to the Grand Canary, which is  properly the seat of power; and though not long fixed here, has already  found means to establish a manufactory in cotton, silk, and thread,  under excellent regulations, which employs more than sixty persons, and  is of infinite service to the common people. During our short stay we  had every day some fresh proof of his Excellency's esteem and attention,  and had the honour of dining with him, in a style of equal elegance and  splendor. At this entertainment the profusion of ices which appeared in  the desert was surprising, considering that we were enjoying them under  a sun nearly vertical. But it seems the caverns of the Peak, very far  below its summit, afford, at all seasons, ice in abundance.    The restless importunity of the beggars, and the immodesty of the lowest  class of women, are highly disgusting. From the number of his countrymen  to be found, an Englishman is at no loss for society. In the mercantile  houses established here, it is from gentlemen of this description that  any information is derived, for the taciturnity of the Spaniards is not  to be overcome in a short acquaintance, especially by Englishmen, whose  reserve falls little short of their own. The inland country is described  as fertile, and highly romantic; and the environs of the small town of  Laguza mentioned as particularly pleasant. Some of our officers who made  an excursion to it confirmed the account amply.    It should seem that the power of the Church, which has been so long  on the decline in Europe, is at length beginning to be shaken in the  colonies of the Catholic powers: some recent instances which have taken  place at Teneriffe, evince it very fully. Were not a stranger, however,  to be apprized of this, he would hardly draw the conclusion from his own  observations. The Bishop of these islands, which conjunctively form a  See, resides on the Grand Canary. He is represented as a man in years,  and of a character as amiable as exalted, extremely beloved both by  foreigners and those of his own church. The bishopric is valued at ten  thousand pounds per annum; the government at somewhat less than two.    In spite of every precaution, while we lay at anchor in the road, a  convict had the address, one night, to secrete himself on the deck, when  the rest were turned below; and after remaining quiet for some hours,  let himself down over the bow of the ship, and floated to a boat that  lay astern, into which he got, and cutting her adrift, suffered himself  to be carried away by the current, until at a sufficient distance to  be out of hearing, when he rowed off. This elopement was not discovered  till some hours after, when a search being made, and boats sent to the  different parts of the island, he was discovered in a small cove, to  which he had fled for refuge. On being questioned, it appeared he had  endeavoured to get himself received on board a Dutch East Indiaman in  the road; but being rejected there, he resolved on crossing over to  the Grand Canary, which is at the distance of ten leagues, and when  detected, was recruiting his strength in order to make the attempt. At  the same time that the boats of the fleet were sent on this pursuit,  information was given to the Spanish Governor of what had happened,  who immediately detached parties every way in order to apprehend the  delinquent.    Having remained a week at Teneriffe, and in that time completed our  stock of water, and taken on board wine, &c. early on the morning of  the 10th of June we weighed anchor, and stood out to sea with a light  easterly breeze. The shortness of our stay, and the consequent hurry,  prevented our increasing much any previous knowledge we might have had  of the place. For the information of those who may follow us on this  service, it may not, however, be amiss to state the little that will be  found of use to them.    The markets afford fresh meat, though it is neither plentiful nor good.  Fish is scarce; but poultry may be procured in almost any quantity, at  as cheap a rate as in the English sea-ports. Vegetables do not abound,  except pumpkins and onions, of which I advise all ships to lay in a  large stock. Milch goats are bought for a trifle, and easily procured.  Grapes cannot be scarce in their season; but when we were here, except  figs and excellent mulberries, no fruit was to be procured. Dry wines,  as the merchants term them, are sold from ten to fifteen pounds a pipe;  for the latter price, the very best, called the London Particular, may  be bought: sweet wines are considerably dearer. Brandy is also a cheap  article. I would not advise the voyager to depend on this place for  either his hogs or sheep. And he will do well to supply himself with  dollars before he quits England, to expend in the different ports he may  happen to touch at. Should he, however, have neglected this precaution,  let him remember when he discounts bills, or exchanges English money  here, not to receive his returns in quarter dollars, which will be  tendered to him, but altogether in whole ones, as he will find the  latter turn to better account than the former, both at Rio de Janeiro  and the Cape of Good Hope.    The latitude of the town of Santa Cruz is 28 deg 27 1/2 min north, the  longitude 16 deg 17 1/2 min west of Greenwich.          CHAPTER IV.        The Passage from Teneriffe to Rio de Janeiro, in the Brazils.      In sailing from Teneriffe to the south-east, the various and picturesque  appearances of the Peak are beautiful to the highest degree. The  stupendous height, which before was lost on the traveller, now strikes  him with awe and admiration, the whole island appearing one vast  mountain with a pyramidal top. As we proceeded with light winds, at an  easy rate, we saw it distinctly for three days after our departure,  and should have continued to see it longer, had not the haziness of the  atmosphere interrupted our view. The good people of Santa Cruz tell some  stories of the wonderful extent of space to be seen from the summit  of it, that would not disgrace the memoirs of the ever-memorable Baron  Munchausen.    On the 18th of June we saw the most northerly of the Cape de Verd  Islands, at which time the Commodore gave the fleet to understand, by  signal, that his intention was to touch at some of them. The following  day we made St. Jago, and stood in to gain an anchorage in Port Praya  Bay. But the baffling winds and lee current rendering it a matter of  doubt whether or not the ships would be able to fetch, the signal for  anchoring was hauled down, and the fleet bore up before the wind. In  passing along them we were enabled to ascertain the south end of the  Isle of Sal to be in 16 deg 40 min north latitude, and 23 deg 5 min west  longitude. The south end of Bonavista to be in 15 deg 57 min north, 23  deg 8 min west. The south end of the Isle of May in 15 deg 11 min north,  23 deg 26 min west; and the longitude of the fort, in the town of Port  Praya, to be 23 deg 36 1/2 min west of Greenwich.    By this time the weather, from the sun being so far advanced in the  northern tropic, was become intolerably hot, which, joined to the heavy  rains that soon after came on, made us very apprehensive for the health  of the fleet. Contrary, however, to expectation, the number of sick in  the ship I was embarked on was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#2)"],[1,"do is to be nice  to them and think of little things to please them. I never think of  any myself. Jerry does; that's why all the old ladies like him. It's  not bribery. It's a sort of honesty like paying for things.\"    \"Well, anyway,\" said Jimmy, putting away the moral question,  \"we've got a ripping day for the woods.\"    They had.    The wide High Street, even at the busy morning hour almost as  quiet as a dream-street, lay bathed in sunshine; the leaves shone  fresh from last night's rain, but the road was dry, and in the  sunshine the very dust of it sparkled like diamonds. The beautiful  old houses, standing stout and strong, looked as though they were  basking in the sunshine and enjoying it.    \"But are there any woods?\" asked Kathleen as they passed the  market-place.    \"It doesn't much matter about woods,\" said Gerald dreamily, \"we're  sure to find something. One of the chaps told me his father said  when he was a boy there used to be a little cave under the bank in  a lane near the Salisbury Road; but he said there was an enchanted  castle there too, so perhaps the cave isn't true either.\" \"If we were  to get horns,\" said Kathleen, \"and to blow them very hard all the  way, we might find a magic castle.\"    \"If you've got the money to throw away on horns...\" said Jimmy  contemptuously.    \"Well, I have, as it happens, so there!\" said Kathleen. And the  horns were bought in a tiny shop with a bulging window full of a  tangle of toys and sweets and cucumbers and sour apples.    And the quiet square at the end of the town where the church is,  and the houses of the most respectable people, echoed to the sound  of horns blown long and loud. But none of the houses turned into  enchanted castles. Away they went along the Salisbury Road,  which was very hot and dusty, so they agreed to drink one of the  bottles of ginger-beer.    \"We might as well carry the ginger-beer inside us as inside the  bottle,\" said Jimmy, \"and we can hide the bottle and call for it as  we come back.    Presently they came to a place where the road, as Gerald said,  went two ways at once.    \"That looks like adventures,\" said Kathleen; and they took the  right-hand road, and the next time they took a turning it was a  left-hand one, \"so as to be quite fair,\" Jimmy said, and then a  right-hand one and then a left, and so on, till they were completely  lost.    \"Completely,\" said Kathleen; \"how jolly!\"    And now trees arched overhead, and the banks of the road were  high and bushy. The adventurers had long since ceased to blow  their horns. It was too tiring to go on doing that, when there was no  one to be annoyed by it.    \"Oh, kriky!\" observed Jimmy suddenly, \"let's sit down a bit and  have some of our dinner. We might call it lunch, you know,\" he  added persuasively.    So they sat down in the hedge and ate the ripe red gooseberries  that were to have been their dessert.    And as they sat and rested and wished that their boots did not feel  so full of feet, Gerald leaned back against the bushes, and the  bushes gave way so that he almost fell over backward. Something  had yielded to the pressure of his back, and there was the sound of  something heavy that fell.    \"Oh, Jimminy!\" he remarked, recovering himself suddenly; \"there's  something hollow in there the stone I was leaning against simply  went!\"    \"I wish it was a cave,\" said Jimmy; \"but of course it isn't.\"    \"If we blow the horns perhaps it will be,\" said Kathleen, and  hastily blew her own.    Gerald reached his hand through the bushes. \"I can't feel anything  but air,\" he said; \"it's just a hole full of emptiness. The other two  pulled back the bushes. There certainly was a hole in the bank.  \"I'm going to go in,\" observed Gerald.    \"Oh, don't!\" said his sister. \"I wish you wouldn't. Suppose there  were snakes!\"    \"Not likely,\" said Gerald, but he leaned forward and struck a  match. \"It is a cave!\" he cried, and put his knee on the mossy stone  he had been sitting on, scrambled over it, and disappeared.    A breathless pause followed.    \"You all right?\" asked Jimmy.    \"Yes; come on. You'd better come feet first there's a bit of a drop.\"    \"I'll go next,\" said Kathleen, and went feet first, as advised. The  feet waved wildly in the air.    \"Look out!\" said Gerald in the dark; \"you'll have my eye out. Put  your feet down, girl, not up. It's no use trying to fly here there's no  room.\"    He helped her by pulling her feet forcibly down and then lifting  her under the arms. She felt rustling dry leaves under her boots,  and stood ready to receive Jimmy, who came in head first, like one  diving into an unknown sea.    \"It is a cave,\" said Kathleen.    \"The young explorers,\" explained Gerald, blocking up the hole of  entrance with his shoulders, \"dazzled at first by the darkness of the  cave, could see nothing.\"    \"Darkness doesn't dazzle,\" said Jimmy.    \"I wish we'd got a candle,\" said Kathleen.    \"Yes, it does,\" Gerald contradicted \"could see nothing. But their  dauntless leader, whose eyes had grown used to the dark while the  clumsy forms of the others were bunging up the entrance, had  made a discovery.    \"Oh, what!\" Both the others were used to Gerald's way of telling a  story while he acted it, but they did sometimes wish that he didn't  talk quite so long and so like a book in moments of excitement.    \"He did not reveal the dread secret to his faithful followers till one  and all had given him their word of honour to be calm.\"    \"We'll be calm all right,\" said Jimmy impatiently.\"Well, then,\" said  Gerald, ceasing suddenly to be a book and becoming a boy,  \"there's a light over there look behind you!\"    They looked. And there was. A faint greyness on the brown walls  of the cave, and a brighter greyness cut off sharply by a dark line,  showed that round a turning or angle of the cave there was  daylight.    \"Attention!\" said Gerald; at least, that was what he meant, though  what he said was \"Shun!\" as becomes the son of a soldier. The  others mechanically obeyed.    \"You will remain at attention till I give the word \"Slow march!' on  which you will advance cautiously in open order, following your  hero leader, taking care not to tread on the dead and wounded.\"    \"I wish you wouldn't!\" said Kathleen.    \"There aren't any,\" said Jimmy, feeling for her hand in the dark;  \"he only means, take care not to tumble over stones and things\"    Here he found her hand, and she screamed.    \"It's only me,\" said Jimmy. \"I thought you'd like me to hold it. But  you're just like a girl.\"    Their eyes had now begun to get accustomed to the darkness, and  all could see that they were in a rough stone cave, that went  straight on for about three or four yards and then turned sharply to  the right.    \"Death or victory!\" remarked Gerald. \"Now, then Slow march!\"    He advanced carefully, picking his way among the loose earth and  stones that were the floor of the cave.    \"A sail, a sail!\" he cried, as he turned the corner.    \"How splendid!\" Kathleen drew a long breath as she came out into  the sunshine.    \"I don't see any sail,\" said Jimmy, following.    The narrow passage ended in a round arch all fringed with ferns  and creepers. They passed through the arch into a deep, narrow  gully whose banks were of stones, moss-covered; and in the  crannies grew more ferns and long grasses. Trees growing on the  top of the bank arched across, and the sunlight came through in  changing patches of brightness, turning the gully to a roofed  corridor of goldy-green. The path, which was of greeny-grey  flagstones where heaps of leaves had drifted, sloped steeply down,  and at the end of it was another round arch, quite dark inside,  above which rose rocks and grass and bushes.    \"It's like the outside of a railway tunnel,\" said James.    \"It's the entrance to the enchanted castle,\" said Kathleen. \"Let's  blow the horns.\"    \"Dry up!\" said Gerald. \"The bold Captain, reproving the silly  chatter of his subordinates ,\"    \"I like that!\" said Jimmy, indignant.    \"I thought you would,\" resumed Gerald \"of his subordinates, bade  them advance with caution and in silence, because after all there  might be somebody about, and the other arch might be an  ice-house or something dangerous.    \"What?\" asked Kathleen anxiously.    \"Bears, perhaps,\" said Gerald briefly.    \"There aren't any bears without bars in England, anyway,\" said  Jimmy. \"They call bears bars in America,\" he added absently.    \"Quick march!\" was Gerald's only reply.    And they marched. Under the drifted damp leaves the path was  firm and stony to their shuffling feet. At the dark arch they  stopped.    \"There are steps down,\" said Jimmy.    \"It is an ice-house,\" said Gerald.    \"Don't let's,\" said Kathleen.    \"Our hero,\" said Gerald, \"who nothing could dismay, raised the  faltering hopes of his abject minions by saying that he was jolly  well going on, and they could do as they liked about it.\"    \"If you call names,\" said Jimmy, \"you can go on by yourself. He  added, \"So there!\"    \"It's part of the game, silly,\" explained Gerald kindly. \"You can be  Captain tomorrow, so you'd better hold your jaw now, and begin to  think about what names you'll call us when it's your turn.\"    Very slowly and carefully they went down the steps. A vaulted  stone arched over their heads. Gerald struck a match when the last  step was found to have no edge, and to be, in fact, the beginning of  a passage, turning to the left.    \"This,\" said Jimmy, \"will take us back into the road.\"    \"Or under it,\" said Gerald. \"We've come down eleven steps.\"    They went on, following their leader, who went very slowly for  fear, as he explained, of steps. The passage was very dark.    \"I don't half like it!\" whispered Jimmy.    Then came a glimmer of daylight that grew and grew, and  presently ended in another arch that looked out over a scene so like  a picture out of a book about Italy that everyone's breath was taken  away, and they simply"]]]
