The reason for this, in the  first place, is that the section which I have selected is the only one of  which I have any special knowledge; it consists of the bees, wasps, ants  and sandwasps, four groups which make up the stinging section of the  order--or perhaps more accurately, which have poison bags connected with  their egg-laying apparatus or _ovipositor_. Another reason for their  selection lies in their nesting habits; these enable one to get a further  insight into their economy and ways than can be obtained from those of  almost any other group or order--at any rate they make them comparatively  easy to study; one can, so to say, find these little creatures at home,  whereas in most orders there seems to be no definite home to which the {2}  individuals may be traced; a great advantage also in selecting the stinging  groups for study is that they are creatures of the spring and summer, and  of the sunshine, so that the weather which tempts them out to their duties  is of the kind most agreeable to those who wish to investigate their  habits.    The habits of the hive bee have not been touched on, as so many excellent  treatises have been written on them that any observations here would be  superfluous.    Although these groups are distinguished by their stinging habits, it is  only the female that possesses a sting--the male is a most harmless  creature and quite incapable of injuring any one. A male wasp or even a  male hornet may be handled with absolute impunity, only it is wise to be  certain as to the sex of the individual before presuming to play with it  too much! A word here may perhaps be said about stinging. People often talk  about a gnat stinging or a stinging fly; it may be difficult to define  exactly what \"to sting\" means, but the writer has always considered that a  sting is inflicted by the tail end of the creature or a {3} bite by the  mouth. A fly or gnat no doubt inserts its proboscis into one's flesh just  as a wasp does its sting; but the actions of such opposite parts of the  body surely demand distinct names. As we have been alluding to flies it may  not be inappropriate to say here that all the creatures we are going to  consider have four membranous wings except the worker ants and a very few  forms which are comparatively seldom met with. By this character they may  at once be known from flies, which have only two membranous wings. The  large brown \"drone flies\", so often seen on the windows of our rooms,  especially in autumn, and which most people mistake for hive bees, to which  they certainly bear a considerable general resemblance, may be detected at  once by wanting the two hind wings of the bee.    The \"aculeate\", or stinging, Hymenoptera, are divided into sections and  families according to their structure; but the groups which stand out most  clearly in regard to their habits are the solitary and social species, the  predaceous and non-predaceous and the inquilines or cuckoos. {4}    The vast majority of the aculeate Hymenoptera are what are called  \"solitary\", i.e. one male and one female alone are interested in the  production of the nest; but there are also three \"social\" groups--the ants,  the true wasps, and the humble and hive bees.    These are called social because they form communities and all work together  towards the maintenance of the nest. In the social species there are two  forms of the females--the queens and the workers; these latter have the  ovaries imperfectly developed, and in the humble bees and wasps they only  differ outwardly from the fully developed females or queens by being  smaller. In the ants, however, the workers are wingless, and of a very  different form from that of the queen. The role of these workers seems to  be to do the general work of the nest; they have been known to lay fertile  eggs, but the resulting offspring has always been male.    Between these conditions of solitary and social we know of no actually  intermediate stages. We do not seem to see any attempts on the part of  solitary bees to become social or vice versa. The only condition known  which {5} could possibly be considered as intermediate is shown in certain  species where a number of individuals make their nests close to each other  in some particular bank, forming a colony. These colonies are sometimes  very extensive, and the burrows of the individual bees very close together;  it has also been shown that the burrows sometimes unite--at the same time  there seems to be no positive evidence that there is any work done in the  colony which could be considered as done for the common good.           *       *       *       *       *    {6}    THE SOLITARY GROUPS    All the solitary kinds appear to feed themselves on vegetable juices,  honey, etc., but there is a well-marked division between those who  provision the cells of their offspring with insects, either fully developed  or in the larval stages, and those who provision them with the pollen of  flowers, honey, etc. The theory is that originally all fed their cells with  insects, but that by degrees the more progressive found that the food which  suited themselves would equally nourish their offspring, and accordingly  provided them with vegetable nourishment. We find no intermediate stages. A  certain class still goes on feeding on the old principle. The members of  this class are known as \"_fossors_\" or diggers, while those which feed on  the new principle are called \"_Anthophila_\" or flower-lovers. These are not  very happy names, as many of the _Anthophila_ dig out holes for their nests  just {7} in the same way as the _fossors_ do, and many of the _fossors_ are  found in flowers, apparently enjoying them just as much as a truly  anthophilous species would, although no doubt often with the ulterior  object of capturing some insect for their young! Still these names are  known as representing these two sections all over the world, and therefore  it is better to keep to them even if they are not as descriptive as one  would like them to be.    The _fossors_, or \"diggers\", have all comparatively short and bifid  tongues, and have, as a rule, little in the way of hairy covering, and what  hairs they have are simple and only in very rare instances branched or  feather-like. The hind legs of the females are not modified in any way so  as to enable them to collect pollen, their legs are usually long and  slender, and they are admirably adapted to their life habits of hunting  spiders, insects, etc., for their young.    On the other hand, the _Anthophila_ or \"flower-lovers\", are specially  adapted for pollen collecting. Their tongues vary from a short form like  that of some _fossors_ to the long tongues of the humble bees. Their hairs  are always plumose {8} or branched on some part of the body and the hind  legs of the females in most species are provided on the tibia or shin with  a special brush on which pollen may be collected. In some of the  long-tongued bees, however, this brush occurs on the underside of the body  instead of on the tibia. The pollen-collecting arrangements of the  different genera of the _Anthophila_ and the corresponding organs for  cleaning off the pollen again are amongst the most interesting instances of  modification and adaptation: some of the more striking of these will be  mentioned later on. (See pp. 65 _sqq._)           *       *       *       *       *    {9}    THE SOLITARY BEES    The life-history of an ordinary pair of solitary bees is, roughly, as  follows: I will take for an example one of the spring species of _Andrena_.  Many people know the little red bee, which for some apparently  unaccountable reason suddenly appears in myriads on their lawn or gravel  path, throwing up little mounds of finely powdered earth--in this respect  being quite different from worm casts, which are formed of wet mould and  the particles of which cling together--sometimes causing considerable alarm  as to the possible effect on the lawn. These have hatched out from burrows  made by their parents in the previous year, the mouths of which have been  filled up with earth and therefore are quite invisible till the newly  fledged bees gnaw their way out. They, in their turn, are now making fresh  burrows for their own broods; possibly they infested some one else's lawn  the year before or were only in comparatively small {10} numbers on the  lawn under notice and so passed unrecognized. They may safely be left  alone, as they never seem to breed many consecutive years in one such  locality: probably the treatment of a lawn does not suit them, mowing and  rolling upsetting their arrangements. We will now consider these  arrangements. The female bee, so soon as she realizes that she is charged  with the duty of providing for her future offspring, makes a burrow in the  ground, and the earth thrown up from the tunnel forms the little heap which  is so observable; this burrow varies in depth from 6 to 12 inches and has  short lateral branches; each of these she shapes, more or less, into the  form of a cell, provisions it with a small mass of pollen mixed with honey  for the maintenance of the larva when hatched, and lays her egg; she then  seals up that cell and proceeds to the next, and in this way fills the  burrow up until pretty near the surface.

Assistance with certain parts  of the study were received from a contract (NR163014) between the  Office of Naval Research of the United States Navy and the University  of Kansas.          MYOLOGY OF THE PELVIC APPENDAGE      General Statement    In an excellent paper in which the muscles of the pelvic appendage of  birds are carefully and accurately described, Hudson (1937) reviewed  briefly the more important literature pertaining to the musculature of  the leg which had been published to that date. A review of such  information here, therefore, seems unnecessary.    Myological formulae suggested by Garrod (1873, 1874) have been  extensively used by taxonomists as aids in characterizing the orders  of birds. Relatively few investigations, however, involving the  comparative myology of the leg have been undertaken at family and  subfamily levels. The works of Fisher (1946), Hudson (1948), and  Berger (1952) are notable exceptions.    The terminology for the muscles used in this paper follows that of  Hudson (1937), except that I have followed Berger (1952) in Latinizing  all names. Homologies are not given since these are reviewed by  Hudson. Osteological terms are from Howard (1929).      Materials and Methods    Specimens were preserved in a solution of one part formalin to eight  parts of water. Thorough injection of all tissues was necessary for  satisfactory preservation. Most of the down and contour feathers were  removed to allow the preservative to reach the skin.    In preparing specimens for study, the legs and pelvic girdle were  removed and washed in running water for several hours to remove much  of the formalin. They were then transferred to a mixture of 50 per  cent alcohol and a small amount of glycerine.    All specimens were dissected with the aid of a low power binocular  microscope. Where possible, several specimens of each species were  examined for individual differences. Such differences were found to be  slight, involving mainly size and shape of the muscles. The size is  dependent partly on the age of the bird, muscles from older birds  being larger and better developed. The shape of a muscle (whether long  and slender or short and thick) is due in part to the position in  which the leg was preserved; that is to say, a muscle may be extended  in one bird and contracted in another. For these reasons, descriptions  and comparisons are based mainly on the origin and insertion of a  muscle and on its position in relation to adjoining muscles.    Birds dissected in this study are listed below (in the order of the A.  O. U. Check-List):                                   SPECIES     _Vireo olivaceus_ (Linnaeus)        _Leucosticte tephrocotis_   _Seiurus motacilla_ (Vieillot)         (Swainson)   _Passer domesticus_ (Linnaeus)      _Spinus tristis_ (Linnaeus)   _Estrilda amandava_ (Linnaeus)      _Loxia curvirostra_ Linnaeus   _Poephila guttata_ (Reichenbach)    _Chlorura chlorura_ (Audubon)   _Icterus galbula_ (Linnaeus)        _Pipilo erythrophthalmus_   _Molothrus ater_ (Boddaert)            (Linnaeus)   _Piranga rubra_ (Linnaeus)          _Calamospiza melanocorys_   _Richmondena cardinalis_ (Linnaeus)    Stejneger   _Guiraca caerulea_ (Linnaeus)       _Chondestes grammacus_ (Say)   _Passerina cyanea_ (Linnaeus)       _Junco hyemalis_ (Linnaeus)   _Spiza americana_ (Gmelin)          _Spizella arborea_ (Wilson)   _Hesperiphona vespertina_ (Cooper)  _Zonotrichia querula_ (Nuttall)   _Carpodacus purpureus_ (Gmelin)     _Passerella iliaca_ (Merrem)   _Pinicola enucleator_ (Linnaeus)    _Calcarius lapponicus_ (Linnaeus)      Description of Muscles    The descriptions which follow are those of the muscles in the leg of  the Red-eyed Towhee, _Pipilo erythrophthalmus_. Differences between  species, where present, are noted for each muscle. The term thigh is  used to refer to the proximal segment of the leg; the term crus is  used for that segment of the leg immediately distal to the thigh.      _+Musculus iliotrochantericus posticus+_ (Fig. 2).--The origin of this  muscle is fleshy from the entire concave lateral surface of the ilium  anterior to the acetabulum. The fibers converge posteriorly, and the  muscle inserts by a short, broad tendon on the lateral surface of the  femur immediately distal to the trochanter. It is the largest muscle  which passes from the ilium to the femur.    Action.--Moves femur forward and rotates it anteriorly.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus iliotrochantericus anticus+_ (Fig. 3).--Covered laterally  by the _m. iliotrochantericus posticus_, this slender muscle  has a fleshy origin from the anteroventral edge of the ilium  between the origins of the _m. sartorius_ anteriorly and the _m.  iliotrochantericus medius_ posteriorly. The _m. iliotrochantericus  anticus_ is directed caudoventrally and inserts by a broad, flat  tendon on the anterolateral surface of the femur between the heads of  the _m. femorotibialis externus_ and _m. femorotibialis medius_ and  just distal to the insertion of the _m. iliotrochantericus medius_.    Action.--Moves femur forward and rotates it anteriorly.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species studied.      _+Musculus iliotrochantericus medius+_ (Fig. 3).--Smallest of the  three _iliotrochantericus_ muscles, this bandlike muscle has a fleshy  origin from the ventral edge of the ilium just posterior to the origin  of the _m. iliotrochantericus anticus_. The fibers are directed  caudoventrally, and the insertion is tendinous on the anterolateral  surface of the femur between the insertion of the other two  _iliotrochantericus_ muscles.    Action.--Moves femur forward and rotates it anteriorly.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus iliacus+_ (Figs. 4, 5).--Arising from a fleshy origin on  the ventral edge of the ilium just posterior to the origin of the _m.  iliotrochantericus medius_, this small slender muscle passes  posteroventrally to its fleshy insertion on the posteromedial surface  of the femur just proximal to the origin of the _m. femorotibialis  internus_.    Action.--Moves femur forward and rotates it posteriorly.    Comparison.--No significant differences among the species studied.      _+Musculus sartorius+_ (Figs. 1, 4).--A long, straplike muscle, the  _sartorius_ forms the anterior edge of the thigh. The origin is  fleshy, half from the anterior edge of the ilium and from the median  dorsal ridge of this bone and half from the posterior one or two free  dorsal vertebrae. The insertion is fleshy along a narrow line on the  anteromedial edge of the head of the tibia and on the medial region of  the patellar tendon.    Action.--Moves thigh forward and upward and extends shank.    Comparison.--In _Loxia_ and _Spinus_, only one-third of the origin is  from the last free dorsal vertebra. In _Hesperiphona_, _Carpodacus_,  _Pinicola_, and _Leucosticte_, only one-fifth of the origin is from  this vertebra.      _+Musculus iliotibialis+_ (Fig. 1).--Broad and triangular, this muscle  covers most of the deeper muscles of the lateral aspect of the thigh.  The middle region is fused with the underlying _femorotibialis_  muscles. In the distal half of this muscle there are three distinct  parts; the anterior and posterior edges are fleshy and the central  part is aponeurotic. The origin is from a narrow line along the iliac  crests--from the origin of the _m. sartorius_, anteriorly, to the  origin of the _m. semitendinosus_ posteriorly. The origin is  aponeurotic in the preacetabular region but fleshy in the  postacetabular region. The distal part of the muscle is aponeurotic  and joins with the _femorotibialis_ muscles in the formation of the  patellar tendon. This tendon incloses the patella and inserts on a  line along the proximal edges of the cnemial crests of the  tibiotarsus.    Action.--Extends crus.    Comparison.--In _Vireo_ the central aponeurotic portion of this muscle  is absent.      _+Musculus femorotibialis externus+_ (Fig. 2).--Covering the lateral  and anterolateral surfaces of the femur, this large muscle has a  fleshy origin from the lateral edge of the proximal three-fourths of  the femur. The origin separates the insertion of the _m.  iliotrochantericus anticus_ from that of the _m. ischiofemoralis_ and,  in turn, is separated from the origin of the _m. femorotibialis  medius_ by the insertions of the _m. iliotrochantericus anticus_ and  _m. iliotrochantericus medius_. Approximately midway of the length of  the femur this muscle fuses anteromesially with the _m. femorotibialis  medius_. Distally, the _m. femorotibialis externus_ contributes to the  formation of the patellar tendon which inserts on a line along the  proximal edges of the cnemial crests of the tibiotarsus.    Action.--Extends crus.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species studied.      _+Musculus femorotibialis medius+_ (Figs. 2, 4).--The origin of this  muscle, which lies along the anterior edge of the femur, is fleshy  from the entire length of the femur proximal to the level of  attachment of the proximal arm of the biceps loop. Laterally this  muscle is completely fused for most of its length with the _m.  femorotibialis externus_ and contributes to the formation of the  patellar tendon, which inserts on a line along the proximal edges of  the cnemial crests of the tibiotarsus. Many of the fibers,  nevertheless, insert on the proximal edge of the patella.    Action.--Extends crus.    Comparison.--No significant differences noted among the species  studied.      _+Musculus femorotibialis internus+_ (Fig. 4).--One of the most  superficial muscles lying on the medial surface of the thigh, this  muscle is divided, especially near the distal end, into two parts,  lateral and medial. The origin of the lateral part is fleshy from a  line on the"]]]
