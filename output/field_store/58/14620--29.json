Walker, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); and John W.  Wright, Los Angeles County Museum (LACM). Specimens in the collection at  the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History are identified as KU.  The abbreviations EHT-HMS refer to the Edward H. Taylor-Hobart M. Smith  collection and FAS to the Frederick A. Shannon collection. The  type-specimens from these collections are now in the Field Museum of  Natural History and the University of Illinois Museum of Natural  History.    I have profited from discussions concerning this problem with several  persons, most notably William E. Duellman, Hobart M. Smith, Edward H.  Taylor and Charles F. Walker. Nevertheless, the ideas and conclusions  presented here should not be construed as necessarily reflecting their  opinions.    David M. Dennis executed all of the figures, and my wife, Marsha, typed  the manuscript.      _Materials and Methods._--In the course of this study, 1003 specimens  of the genus were examined. The holotypes of 21 of the 23  nominal species are extant; I have examined 19 of these. Nine  measurements were taken, and five ratios computed for each of 338  specimens. Females are available for all species but one; thus,  measurements were taken on individuals of both sexes.          ANALYSIS OF CHARACTERS      _Size and proportions._--Frogs of this genus range in size from 16  to 40 mm. in snout-vent length. Five species are relatively small:  _S. cystignathoides_, _modestus_, _nivocolimae_, _pallidus_ and  _rubrimaculatus_; one, _S. longipes_, is relatively large, and the  remaining eight species are intermediate in size (22-30 mm.).    Males are generally smaller than females and have proportionately longer  heads and usually larger tympani. No significant differences were found  among proportions, except that _S. longipes_ has a larger tympanum/eye  ratio than any other species. Frogs in the _Syrrhophus marnockii_ group  tend to have shorter shanks and feet, thereby giving those species a  more stocky appearance. However, the differences are not significant.    A summary of the data on size and proportions for the frogs of the genus  _Syrrhophus_ is given in Tables 4, 5, and 6.      _Hands and Feet._--Taylor and Smith (1945), Smith and Taylor (1948),  Firschein (1954) and Duellman (1958) discussed the value of the palmar  tubercles in identifying frogs of this genus. The eastern complex in  general has a well-developed outer palmar tubercle (Fig. 1) in  distinction to the western complex in which the outer palmar tubercle is  reduced or absent (Fig. 2). Dixon and Webb (1966) imply that the outer  palmar tubercle is rarely absent but is usually smaller than the first  supernumerary tubercle of the fourth finger. My study of the western  species demonstrates that the outer palmar tubercle is indeed usually  present and smaller than the first supernumerary tubercle.    Differences in interpretation of the terms \"unexpanded\" and \"narrow,\" as  well as differences in techniques of preservation, have led to confusion  of the reported digital shapes in various species. Constant specific  differences are evident in the hands (Fig. 1). Except in the cases of  excessive uptake of fluids, all species have a terminal transverse  groove at the tip of each digit. Taylor (1940b) stated that _S. smithi_  lacked grooves, but examination of the holotype reveals faint grooves at  the tops of the digits. _Syrrhophus guttilatus_, _leprus_, _pipilans_,  and _verrucipes_ lack lateral fringes on the fingers. Lateral fringes  are well developed in the _longipes_ and _modestus_ groups but poorly  defined or absent in the other members of the genus. The digital pads of  the frogs of the _longipes_ group are much broader than those of the  other species and are narrowest in the frogs of the _leprus_ group.  Supernumerary tubercles are present on the palmar surfaces of all  species of the genus.       TABLE 4--Size and Proportions in the Frogs of the _Syrrhophus leprus_     Group.

His arms must come down. Portugal  rejects his name forever!\"    The officers of the King tore down the arms. They thought they had  consigned the name for which the arms stood to oblivion. As the Jewish  hierarchy said of Spinoza: \"Let his name be cast out under the whole  heavens!\" That name rose again.    Years passed and a nephew of Magellan inherited one of the family  estates. He was stoned in the streets on account of his name. This man  fled in exile from Portugal to Brazil. He died there, and said: \"Let no  heir or descendant of mine ever restore the arms of my family.\"    In his will he wrote:    \"I desire that the arms of my family (Magellan) should remain forever  obliterated, as was done by order of my Lord and King, _as a punishment  for the crime_ of Ferdinand Magellan, because he entered the service of  Castile to the injury of our kingdom.\"    It is the history of this same Ferdinand Magellan, whom Portugal and  his own family sought to crush out from the world, that we are now about  to trace.    Following his highest inspiration, he shut his eyes to the present, and  followed the light of the star of destiny in his soul. His discovery  seems to open to the West the doors of China.    He was filled from boyhood with a passion for finding unknown lands and  waters; he was haunted by ideals and visions of noble exploits for the  good of mankind. His own country, Portugal, would not listen to his  projects at the time that he offered them to the court; so, like  Columbus, Vespucci, and Cabot, he sought the favor of another country.  Nothing could stand before the high purpose of his soul. \"If not by  Portugal, then by Spain,\" he said to an intimate friend; meaning that,  if his own country denied him the favor of giving him an opportunity for  exploration, he would present his cause to the court of Spain, which he  did.    This man, whose real name was Fernao de Magalhaes, was born about the  year 1480, at Sabrosa, in Portugal, a wintry district where the hardy  soil and the \"gloomy grandeur\" of the mountain scenery produced men of  strong bodies and lofty spirit. He belonged to a noble family, \"one of  the noblest in the kingdom.\" His boyhood was passed in the sierras. He  had a love of works of geography and travel, and he dreamed even then  of sunny zones, undiscovered waters, and unknown regions of the world.  Henry the Navigator and his school of pilots, astronomers, and  explorers, had left the country full of the spirit of new discoveries  which yet lived.    He went to the capital of Portugal to be educated, and was made a page  to the Queen. He was yet a boy when Columbus returned, bringing the  enthralling news of a new world. Spain was filled with excitement at the  event; her cities rang with jubilees by day and flared with torches at  night. Portugal caught the new spirit of her late King, Henry the  Navigator, and was ambitious to rival the discoveries of Spain. She had  already established herself in the glowing realms of India.    In 1509 Magellan went to the West Indies in the service of the  Portuguese Government. He joined the expedition that discovered the  Spice Islands of Banda, and it became his conviction that these islands  could be reached by a new ocean way.    A great vision arose in his mind. It was a suggestion that never left  him until he saw its fulfillment in an unexpected way on seas of which  he never had dreamed.    This view was that he could sail around the world and reach the Spice  Islands by the way of the West.    [Illustration: Lisbon, from the south bank of the Tagus.]    In the service of the King against the Moors in one of the Portuguese  wars, he received a wound which healed, but left him lame for life. He,  like other officers, sent in his claim for the pension due to such  service. He received answer from the parsimonious King (Dom Manoel):    \"Your claim is not good. Your wound has healed.\"    He was wounded more deeply by this insult than he could have been by any  poisoned dart from the Moors. That he should have been refused the  recognition of those who had shed blood in his country's cause rankled  in his heart, especially as he saw his comrades paraded in honor and  pensioned for lesser disabilities. He left Portugal, as an exile, and  went to Spain.    Here the high aspirations of the lame soldier met with recognition, and  it was this service that caused the Portuguese King to issue the strange  order which has introduced the young and high-spirited grandee to the  readers of this story.    If he had faults--as far as history records he had no vices--his high  aim overcame them. He had caught the spirit of Portuguese Henry the  Navigator, and his soul had glowed when the fame of Columbus first  thrilled Spain. He had learned the history of Vasco da Gama, whose name  was the glory of Portugal. He had educated himself for action.    [Illustration: Ferdinand Magellan. After a painting by Velasquez.]    It was the age of opportunity. He saw it; he could not know the way,  but he knew the guide that was in him. As a son of the Church, which he  then was, he consecrated all he had to her glory. What was fame, what  was wealth, what was anything to becoming a benefactor of the world, and  living forever in the heart of all mankind?    So his deserted house crumbed in Sabrosa, and his coat of arms did not  there reappear until centuries had followed the course of his genius,  and the whole world came to know his worth.    In view of recent events his character becomes one of the most  interesting of past history.    After nearly four hundred years that cast-out name rises like a star!    Why, in the view of to-day, was that name cast out?    Because Magellan saw his duty in a larger life than in the restrictions  of a provincial court. The lesson has its significance. He who sinks  self and policy, and follows his highest duty and enters the widest  field, will in the final judgment of man receive the noblest and best  reward.    We love a lover of mankind, and it strengthens faith and hope to follow  the keel of such a sailor on any sea.          CHAPTER II.    FRIENDS WITH A PURPOSE.      Souls kindle kindred souls, and the inspirations of friendship commonly  form a part of the early history of beneficent lives.    One of Magellan's early friends was Francisco Serrao, who sailed with  him for Malacca, a great mart of merchandise in the East. It was to him  that Magellan wrote that he would meet him again in the East, \"if not by  the way of Portugal, by that of Spain;\" words of signal import, which we  have already quoted.    Serrao had a very curious, romantic, and pathetic history. He lived in  the times of the Portuguese Viceroys of India. He was made captain of a  ship which sought to explore the Spice Islands, which were then held to  be the paradise of the East. Cloves and nutmegs then were luxuries, and  when brought to Portugal bore the flavor of the sun lands of the far-off  mysterious seas.    At Banda ships were loaded with spices. On sailing there Serrao suffered  shipwreck and was cast upon a reef and found refuge on a deserted  island. The place was a resort of pirates or wreckers. Some pirates  sighted the wreck of the ship and sought to plunder the wreckage.    \"We have no ship, and the island is without food or water,\" said Serrao  to his men. \"Hide under the rock and obey me, and we will soon have a  ship and water and food.\"    The men hid among the caverns of the reef. The pirates landed, and left  their ship for the wreckage.    Serrao rushed through the surf, followed by his men, and boarded the  pirates' vessel.    The wreckers were filled with terror when they saw what would be their  fate if left there, and they begged to be taken on board, and were  received by Serrao as prisoners.    Serrao traded for many years among the Spice Islands and was advanced to  high positions, but was poisoned at last, as is supposed, by an intrigue  of the King of Tidor.    One of the most inspiring of Magellan's friends was Ruy Faleiro, who had  wonderful instincts and a wide vision, but who became a madman. Faleiro  was a Portuguese who, like Magellan, was out of favor with the court. He  was an astronomer, a geographer, and an astrologer. He had a fiery and  impulsive temper, but with it a passion for discovery, and so was drawn  into Magellan's heart by gravitation. The two journeyed together,  studied together, and started at about the same time for Spain. At  Seville they met in a club of famous discoverers, students, and  refugees.    They had one vision in common, that there was a short route to the  Moluccas by the way of the West. The route was not what they dreamed it  to be; but there was a new way to the Spice Islands by the West and  East, a way that probably no voyager from Europe had ever seen, and  their vision was decisive of one of the greatest events--the  circumnavigation of the world. The angle of vision was not true in their  private meetings, nor had Magellan's been before they met; but another  angle leading from it was true, and would cause a change of the  conception of the world when poor Ruy Faleiro's brain was losing its  hold on such entrancing hopes.    \"We can reach Molucca by a short voyage to the West,\" said Ruy Faleiro.    \"I am sure that I can do this, if I can have an expedition such as the  King of Spain can give me,\" said Magellan.    \"You must never communicate this secret to any man,\" said Ruy.    \"I will never mention the subject to any but you,\" said Magellan, \"until  we can act together.\"    The vision of finding the East by a short passage to the West, involved  so great a prospect of human progress and glory that it would not let  Magellan rest at any time. It haunted him wherever he went. He began to  talk about it under"]]]
