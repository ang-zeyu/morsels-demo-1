The climate of Mesa Verde is semi-arid, and most months are dry and  pleasant. Annual precipitation has averaged about 18.5 inches for the  last 40 years. July and August are the months having the most rainfall.  Snow falls intermittently in winter, and may persist all winter on  north-facing slopes and in valleys. In most years, snow is melting and  the kinds of animals that hibernate are emerging by the first of April.    Because of the great differences in elevation between the northern and  southern ends of the mesas, differences in climate are appreciable at  these locations. Winter always is the more severe on the northern end of  the park, owing to persistent winds, lower temperatures, and more snow.  The northern end of the park is closer to the nearby La Platta Mountains  where ephemeral storms of summer originate. They reach the higher  elevations of the park first, but such storms dissipate rapidly and are  highly localized. The northern end of the park therefore receives much  more precipitation in summer and winter than does the southern end.    The difference in precipitation and the extremes in weather between the  northern and southern ends of the mesas affect the distribution of  plants and animals. Species of mammals, plants, and reptiles are most  numerous on the middle parts of the mesas, as also are cliff-dwellings,  surface sites, and farming terraces of the prehistoric Indians.    Anderson (1961) reported on the mammals of Mesa Verde National Park, and  Douglas (1966) reported on the amphibians and reptiles. In each of these  reports, earlier collections are listed and earlier reports are  summarized.    I lived in Mesa Verde National Park for 28 months in the period July  1961 to September 1964, while working as Biologist for the Wetherill  Mesa Archeological Project, and the study here reported on is one of the  faunal studies that I undertook.          ACKNOWLEDGMENTS      This study could not have been completed without the assistance and  encouragement of numerous persons. I am grateful to Dr. Olwen Williams,  of the University of Colorado, for suggesting this study and helping me  plan the early phases of it.    Mr. Chester A. Thomas, formerly Superintendent, and Mrs. Jean Pinkley,  formerly Chief of Interpretation at Mesa Verde National Park, permitted  me to use the park's facilities for research, issued collecting permits,  and in 1965 appointed me as a research collaborator in order that I  might complete my studies.    Dr. H. Douglas Osborne, California State College, Long Beach, formerly  Supervisory Archeologist of the Wetherill Mesa Project, took an active  interest in my research and provided supplies, transportation and  laboratory and field assistance under the auspices of the Wetherill  Project. His assistance and encouragement are gratefully acknowledged.    Mrs. Marilyn A. Colyer of Mancos, Colorado, ably assisted in analyzing  vegetation in the trapping grid; Mr. Robert R. Patterson, the University  of Kansas, assisted me in the field in October of 1963 and in August of  1965. Mr. James A. Erdman, United States Geological Survey, Denver,  formerly Botanist for the Wetherill Mesa Project, and Dr. Stanley L.  Welsh, Brigham Young University, identified plants for me in the field,  and checked my identifications of herbarium specimens. I owe my  knowledge of the flora in the park to my association with these two  capable botanists.    I am grateful to the following persons for identification of  invertebrates: D. Eldon Beck, fleas and ticks; Paul Winston, mites; V.  Eugene Nelson, mites; William Wrenn, mites; Wayne W. Moss, mites;  William B. Nutting, mites (_Desmodex_); Marilyn A. Colyer, insects; John  E. Ubelaker, endoparasites; Veryl F. Keen, botflies. George A. King,  Architect, of Durango, Colorado, prepared the original map for Figure 1.    Mr. Harold Shepherd of Mancos, Colorado, Senior Game Biologist, Colorado  Department of Fish, Game and Parks, obtained permission for me to use  the department's trapping grid near Far View Ruins, and provided me with  preserved specimens of mice.    Mr. Fred E. Mang Jr., Photographer, National Park Service, processed  large numbers of photomicrographs of plant epidermis. Dr. Kenneth B.  Armitage, The University of Kansas, offered valuable suggestions for the  study of water consumption in the two species of _Peromyscus_, and  permitted me to use facilities of the Zoological Research Laboratories  at The University of Kansas. Dr. Richard F. Johnston, The University of  Kansas, permitted me to house mice in his controlled-temperature room at  the Zoological Research Laboratories. I am grateful to all of the above  mentioned persons for their aid.    I acknowledge with gratitude the guidance, encouragement, and critical  assistance of Professor E. Raymond Hall throughout the course of the  study and preparation of the manuscript. I also extend my sincere thanks  to Professors Henry S. Fitch, Robert W. Baxter, and William A. Clemens  for their helpful suggestions and assistance.    To my wife, Virginia, I am grateful for encouragement and assistance  with many time-consuming tasks connected with field work and preparation  of the manuscript.    Travel funds provided by the Kansas Academy of Science permitted me to  work in the park in August, 1965. The Wetherill Mesa Project was an  interdisciplinary program of the National Park Service to which the  National Geographic Society contributed generously. I am indebted to the  Society for a major share of the support that resulted in this report.  This is contribution No. 44 of the Wetherill Mesa Project.          DESCRIPTIONS OF MAJOR TRAPPING LOCALITIES      Trapping was begun in September of 1961 in order to analyze the  composition of rodent populations within the park. I used the method of  trapping employed by Calhoun (1948) in making the Census of North  American Small Mammals (N. A. C. S. M.). It consisted of two lines of  traps, each 1,000 feet long having 20 trapping stations that were 50  feet apart. The lines were either parallel at a distance of 400 feet  from each other, or were joined to form a line 2,000 feet long. Three  snap traps were placed within a five-foot radius of each station, and  were set for three consecutive nights. More than a dozen areas were  selected for extensive trapping (Fig. 1). Some of these were retrapped  in consecutive years in order to measure changes in populations.    One circular trapline of 159.5 feet radius was established in November  1961, and was tended for 30 consecutive days to observe the effect of  removing the more dominant species (Calhoun, 1959).    Other mouse traps and rat traps were set in suitable places on talus  slopes, rocky cliffs, and in cliff dwellings. Most of these traps were  operated for three consecutive nights.    In order to test hypotheses concerning habitat preferences of each of  the species of _Peromyscus_, several previously untrapped areas that  appeared to be ideal habitat for one species, but not for the other,  were selected for sampling. In the summers of 1963 and 1964 snap traps  were set along an arbitrary line through each of these areas. Traps were  placed in pairs; each pair was 20 feet from the adjacent pairs.    A mixture of equal parts of peanut butter, bacon grease, raisins, roman  meal and rolled oats was used as bait. Rolled oats or coarsely ground  scratch feed was used in areas where insects removed the mixture from  the traps.    Rodents trapped by me were variously prepared as study skins with  skulls, as flat skins with skulls, as skeletons, as skulls only, or as  alcoholics. Representative specimens were deposited in The University of  Kansas Museum of Natural History. In the course of my study, traps were  set in the following areas:      _Morfield Ridge_    In July 1959 a fire destroyed more than 2,000 acres of pinyon-juniper  forest (_Pinus edulis_ and _Juniperus osteosperma_) in the eastern part  of the park. The burned area extends from Morfield Canyon to Waters  Canyon, encompassing several canyons, Whites Mesa, and a ridge between  Morfield Canyon and Waters Canyon that is known locally as Morfield  Ridge (Fig. 1). Beginning on September 4, 1961, three pairs of traplines  were run on this ridge at elevations of 7,300 to 7,600 feet.    Vegetation in the trapping area consisted of dense growths of grasses  and herbaceous plants, which had covered the ground with seeds. In this  and in the following accounts, the generic and specific names of plants  are those used by Welsh and Erdman (1964).
