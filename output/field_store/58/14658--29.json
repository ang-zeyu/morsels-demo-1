Now, if the reader wishes to understand what the scope of the  religion of Dionysus was to the Greeks who lived in it, all it  represented to them by way of one clearly conceived yet complex  symbol, let him reflect what the loss would be if all the effect and  expression drawn from the imagery of the vine and the cup fell out of  the whole body of existing poetry; how many fascinating trains of  reflexion, what colour and substance would therewith have been  deducted from it, filled as it is, apart from the more aweful  associations of the Christian ritual, apart from Galahad's cup, with  all the various symbolism of the fruit of the vine.  That supposed  loss is but an imperfect measure of all that the name of Dionysus  recalled to the Greek mind, under a single imaginable form, an  outward body of flesh presented to the senses, and comprehending, as  its animating soul, a whole world of thoughts, surmises, greater and  less experiences.    [11] The student of the comparative science of religions finds in the  religion of Dionysus one of many modes of that primitive tree-worship  which, growing out of some universal instinctive belief that trees  and flowers are indeed habitations of living spirits, is found almost  everywhere in the earlier stages of civilisation, enshrined in legend  or custom, often graceful enough, as if the delicate beauty of the  object of worship had effectually taken hold on the fancy of the  worshipper.  Shelley's Sensitive Plant shows in what mists of  poetical reverie such feeling may still float about a mind full of  modern lights, the feeling we too have of a life in the green world,  always ready to assert its claim over our sympathetic fancies.  Who  has not at moments felt the scruple, which is with us always  regarding animal life, following the signs of animation further  still, till one almost hesitates to pluck out the little soul of  flower or leaf?    And in so graceful a faith the Greeks had their share; what was crude  and inane in it becoming, in the atmosphere of their energetic,  imaginative intelligence, refined and humanised.  The oak-grove of  Dodona, the seat of their most venerable oracle, did but perpetuate  the fancy that the sounds of the wind in the trees may be, for  certain prepared and chosen ears, intelligible voices; they could  believe in the transmigration of souls into mulberry and laurel, mint  and hyacinth; and the dainty Metamorphoses of Ovid [12] are but a  fossilised form of one morsel here and there, from a whole world of  transformation, with which their nimble fancy was perpetually  playing.  \"Together with them,\" says the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite,  of the Hamadryads, the nymphs which animate the forest trees, \"with  them, at the moment of their birth, grew up out of the soil, oak-tree  or pine, fair, flourishing among the mountains.  And when at last the  appointed hour of their death has come, first of all, those fair  trees are dried up; the bark perishes from around them, and the  branches fall away; and therewith the soul of them deserts the light  of the sun.\"+    These then are the nurses of the vine, bracing it with interchange of  sun and shade.  They bathe, they dance, they sing songs of  enchantment, so that those who seem oddly in love with nature, and  strange among their fellows, are still said to be nympholepti; above  all, they are weavers or spinsters, spinning or weaving with airiest  fingers, and subtlest, many-coloured threads, the foliage of the  trees, the petals of flowers, the skins of the fruit, the long thin  stalks on which the poplar leaves are set so lightly that Homer  compares to them, in their constant motion, the maids who sit  spinning in the house of Alcinous.  The nymphs of Naxos, where the  grape-skin is darkest, weave for him a purple robe.  Only, the ivy is  never transformed, is visible as natural ivy to the last, pressing  the [13] dark outline of its leaves close upon the firm, white, quite  human flesh of the god's forehead.    In its earliest form, then, the religion of Dionysus presents us with  the most graceful phase of this graceful worship, occupying a place  between the ruder fancies of half-civilised people concerning life in  flower or tree, and the dreamy after-fancies of the poet of the  Sensitive Plant.  He is the soul of the individual vine, first; the  young vine at the house-door of the newly married, for instance, as  the vine-grower stoops over it, coaxing and nursing it, like a pet  animal or a little child; afterwards, the soul of the whole species,  the spirit of fire and dew, alive and leaping in a thousand vines, as  the higher intelligence, brooding more deeply over things, pursues,  in thought, the generation of sweetness and strength in the veins of  the tree, the transformation of water into wine, little by little;  noting all the influences upon it of the heaven above and the earth  beneath; and shadowing forth, in each pause of the process, an  intervening person--what is to us but the secret chemistry of nature  being to them the mediation of living spirits.  So they passed on to  think of Dionysus (naming him at last from the brightness of the sky  and the moisture of the earth) not merely as the soul of the vine,  but of all that life in flowing things of which the vine is the  symbol, because its most emphatic example.  At Delos he bears a son,  from whom [14] in turn spring the three mysterious sisters Oeno,  Spermo, and Elais, who, dwelling in the island, exercise respectively  the gifts of turning all things at will into oil, and corn, and wine.  In the Bacchae of Euripides, he gives his followers, by miracle,  honey and milk, and the water gushes for them from the smitten rock.  He comes at last to have a scope equal to that of Demeter, a realm as  wide and mysterious as hers; the whole productive power of the earth  is in him, and the explanation of its annual change.  As some embody  their intuitions of that power in corn, so others in wine.  He is the  dispenser of the earth's hidden wealth, giver of riches through the  vine, as Demeter through the grain.  And as Demeter sends the airy,  dainty-wheeled and dainty-winged spirit of Triptolemus to bear her  gifts abroad on all winds, so Dionysus goes on his eastern journey,  with its many intricate adventures, on which he carries his gifts to  every people.    A little Olympus outside the greater, I said, of Dionysus and his  companions; he is the centre of a cycle, the hierarchy of the  creatures of water and sunlight in many degrees; and that fantastic  system of tree-worship places round him, not the fondly whispering  spirits of the more graceful inhabitants of woodland only, the nymphs  of the poplar and the pine, but the whole satyr circle, intervening  between the headship of the vine and the mere earth, the grosser,  less human [15] spirits, incorporate and made visible, of the more  coarse and sluggish sorts of vegetable strength, the fig, the reed,  the ineradicable weed-things which will attach themselves, climbing  about the vine-poles, or seeking the sun between the hot stones.  For  as Dionysus, the spiritual form of the vine, is of the highest human  type, so the fig-tree and the reed have animal souls, mistakeable in  the thoughts of a later, imperfectly remembering age, for mere  abstractions of animal nature; Snubnose, and Sweetwine, and Silenus,  the oldest of them all, so old that he has come to have the gift of  prophecy.    Quite different from them in origin and intent, but confused with  them in form, are those other companions of Dionysus, Pan and his  children.  Home-spun dream of simple people, and like them in the  uneventful tenour of his existence, he has almost no story; he is but  a presence; the spiritual form of Arcadia, and the ways of human life  there; the reflexion, in sacred image or ideal, of its flocks, and  orchards, and wild honey; the dangers of its hunters; its weariness  in noonday heat; its children, agile as the goats they tend, who run,  in their picturesque rags, across the solitary wanderer's path, to  startle him, in the unfamiliar upper places; its one adornment and  solace being the dance to the homely shepherd's pipe, cut by Pan  first from the sedges of the brook Molpeia.    Breathing of remote nature, the sense of which [16] is so profound in  the Homeric hymn to Pan, the pines, the foldings of the hills, the  leaping streams, the strange echoings and dying of sound on the  heights, \"the bird, which among the petals of many-flowered spring,  pouring out a dirge, sends forth her honey-voiced song,\" \"the crocus  and the hyacinth disorderly mixed in the deep grass\"+--things which  the religion of Dionysus loves--Pan joins the company of the Satyrs.  Amongst them, they give their names to insolence and mockery, and the  finer sorts of malice, to unmeaning and ridiculous fear.  But the  best spirits have found in them also a certain human pathos, as in  displaced beings, coming even nearer to most men, in their very  roughness, than the noble and delicate person of the vine; dubious  creatures, half-way between the animal and human kinds, speculating  wistfully on their being, because not wholly understanding themselves  and their place in nature; as the animals seem always to have this  expression to some noticeable degree in the presence of man.  In the  later school of Attic sculpture they are treated with more and more  of refinement, till in some happy moment Praxiteles conceived a  model, often repeated, which concentrates this sentiment of true  humour concerning them; a model of dainty natural ease in posture,  but with the legs slightly crossed, as only lowly-bred gods are used  to carry them, and with some puzzled trouble of youth, you might wish  for a moment [17] to smoothe away, puckering the forehead a little,  between the pointed ears, on which the goodly hair of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4042"],[0,"Mozart: The Man and the Artist, as Revealed in His Own Words (#2)"],[1,"people too early; refresh and strengthen them with the  fresh and lusty Mozart.\" Another time he writes: \"Does it not  seem as if Mozart's works become fresher and fresher the oftener  we hear them?\"    The more we realize that Wagner places a heavy and intoxicating  draught before us the more we shall appreciate the precious  mountain spring which laves us in Mozart's music, and the less  willing we shall be to permit any opportunity to pass unimproved  which offers us the crystal cup. In the mind of Goethe genius was  summed up in the name of Mozart. In a prophetic ecstasy he spoke  the significant words: \"What else is genius than that productive  power through which deeds arise, worthy of standing in the  presence of God and Nature, and which, for this reason, bear  results and are lasting? All the creations of Mozart are of this  class; within them there is a generative force which is  transplanted from generation to generation, and is not likely  soon to be exhausted or devoured.\"        CHIPS FROM THE WORKSHOP        1. \"If one has the talent it pushes for utterance and torments  one; it will out; and then one is out with it without  questioning. And, look you, there is nothing in this thing of  learning out of books. Here, here and here (pointing to his ear,  his head and his heart) is your school. If everything is right  there, then take your pen and down with it; afterward ask the  opinion of a man who knows his business.\"    (To a musically talented boy who asked Mozart how one might learn  to compose.)    2. \"I can not write poetically; I am no poet. I can not divide  and subdivide my phrases so as to produce light and shade; I am  no painter. I can not even give expression to my sentiments and  thoughts by gestures and pantomime; I am no dancer. But I can do  it with tones; I am a musician....I wish you might live till  there is nothing more to be said in music.\"    (Mannheim, November 8, 1777, in a letter of congratulation to his  father who was born on November 14, 1719. Despite his assertion  Mozart was an admirable dancer and passionately devoted to the  sport. [So says Herr Kerst obviously misconceiving Mozart's  words. It is plain to me that the composer had the classic  definition of the dance in mind when he said that he was no  dancer. The dance of which he was thinking was that described by  Charles Kingsley. \"A dance in which every motion was a word, and  rest as eloquent as motion; in which every attitude was a fresh  motive for a sculptor of the purest school, and the highest  physical activity was manifested, not as in coarse pantomime, in  fantastic bounds and unnatural distortions, but in perpetual  delicate modulations of a stately and self-sustained grace.\"  H.E.K.])    3. \"The poets almost remind me of the trumpeters with their  tricks of handicraft. If we musicians were to stick as faithfully  to our rules (which were very good as long as we had no better)  we should make as worthless music as they make worthless books.\"    (Vienna, October 13, 1781, to his father. He is writing about the  libretto of \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail,\" by Stephanie. The  trumpeters at the time still made use of certain flourishes which  had been traditionally preserved in their guild.)    4. \"I have spared neither care nor labor to produce something  excellent for Prague. Moreover it is a mistake to think that the  practice of my art has become easy to me. I assure you, dear  friend, no one has given so much care to the study of composition  as I. There is scarcely a famous master in music whose works I  have not frequently and diligently studied.\"    (A remark to Conductor Kucharz in Prague, who led the rehearsals  for \"Don Giovanni\" in 1787.)    5. \"They are, indeed, the fruit of long and painstaking labor;  but the hope which some of my friends aroused in me, that my work  would be rewarded at least in part, has given me courage and the  flattering belief that these, my offspring, will some day bring  me comfort.\"    (From the dedication of the Six Quartets to Haydn in 1785. The  quartets were sent back to the publisher, Artaria, from Italy,  because \"they contained so many misprints.\" The unfamiliar chords  and dissonances were looked upon as printers' errors.  Grassalkowitsch, a Hungarian prince, thought his musicians were  playing faultily in some of these passages, and when he learned  differently he tore the music in pieces.)    6. \"I can not deny, but must confess that I shall be glad when I  receive my release from this place. Giving lessons here is no  fun; you must work yourself pretty tired, and if you don't give a  good many lessons you will make but little money. You must not  think that it is laziness;--no!--but it goes counter to my  genius, counter to my mode of life. You know that, so to speak, I  am wrapped up in music,--that I practice it all day long,--that I  like to speculate, study, consider. All this is prevented by my  mode of life here. I shall, of course, have some free hours, but  they will be so few that they will be necessary more for  recuperation than work.\"    (Paris, July 31, 1778, to his father.)    7. \"M. Le Gros bought the 'Sinfonie concertante' of me. He thinks  that he is the only one who has it; but that isn't so. It is  still fresh in my head, and as soon as I get home I'll write it  down again.\"    (Paris, October 3, 1778, to his father. An evidence of the  retentiveness of Mozart's memory. In this instance, however, he  did not carry out his expressed intention. Le Gros was director  of the Concerts spirituels.)    8. \"Melody is the essence of music. I compare a good melodist to  a fine racer, and counterpointists to hack post-horses; therefore  be advised, let well alone and remember the old Italian proverb:  Chi sa piu, meno sa--'Who knows most, knows least.'\"    (To the English tenor Michael Kelly, about 1786, in answer to  Kelly's question whether or not he should take up the study of  counterpoint.)    9. \"One of the priests gave me a theme. I took it on a promenade  and in the middle (the fugue was in G minor) I began in the  major, with something jocose but in the same tempo; finally the  theme again, but backwards. Finally I wondered if I might not use  the playful melody as a theme for a fugue. I did not question  long, but made it at once, and it went as accurately as if Daser  had measured it for the purpose. The dean was beside himself.\"    (Augsburg, October 23, 1777, to his father. Daser was a tailor in  Salzburg.)    10. \"Above us is a violinist, below us another, next door a  singing teacher who gives lessons, and in the last room opposite  ours, a hautboyist. Merry conditions for composing! You get so  many ideas!\"    (Milan, August 23, 1771, to his \"dearest sister.\")    11. \"If I but had the theme on paper,--worked out, of course. It  is too silly that we have got to hatch out our work in a room.\"    (A remark to his wife while driving through a beautiful bit of  nature and humming all manner of ideas that came into his head.)    12. \"I'd be willing to work forever and forever if I were  permitted to write only such music as I want to write and can  write--which I myself think good. Three weeks ago I made a  symphony, and by tomorrow's post I shall write again to  Hofmeister and offer him three pianoforte quartets, if he has  the money.\"    (Written in 1789 to a baron who was his friend and who had  submitted a symphony for his judgment. F.A. Hofmeister was a  composer and publisher in Vienna.)    13. \"You can do a thing like this for the pianoforte, but not for  the theatre. When I wrote this I was still too fond of hearing my  own music, and never could make an end.\"    (A remark to Rochlitz while revising and abbreviating the  principal air in \"Die Entfuhrung.\")    14. \"You know that I had already finished the first Allegro on  the second day after my arrival here, and consequently had seen  Mademoiselle Cannabich only once. Then came young Danner and  asked me how I intended to write the Andante. 'I will make it fit  the character of Mademoiselle Rose.' When I played it, it pleased  immensely....I was right; she is just like the Andante.\"    (Mannheim, December 6, 1777, to his father. Rose Cannabich was a  pupil of Mozart's, aged thirteen and very talented. \"She is very  sensible for her age, has a staid manner, is serious, speaks  little, but when she does speak it is with grace and amiability,\"  writes Mozart in the same letter. It is also related of Beethoven  that he sometimes delineated persons musically. [Also Schumann.  H.E.K.])    15. \"I have composed a Quintet for Oboe, Clarinet, Horn, Bassoon  and Pianoforte, which has been received with extraordinary favor.  (Kochel, No. 452.) I myself think it the best thing I ever wrote  in my life.\"    (Vienna, April 10, 1784, to his father.)    16. \"As an exercise I have set the aria, 'Non so d'onde viene,'  which Bach composed so beautifully. I did it because I know Bach  so well, and the aria pleases me so much that I can't get it out  of my head. I wanted to see whether or not in spite of these  things I was able to make an aria that should not be a bit like  Bach's. It isn't a bit, not a bit like it.\"    (Mannheim, February 28, 1778, to his father. The lovely aria is  No. 294 in Kochel's catalogue. The Bach referred to was Johann  Christian, the \"London\" Bach.)    17. \"I haven't a single quiet hour here. I can not write except  at night and consequently can not get up early. One is not always  in the mood for writing. Of course I could scribble all day long,  but these things go out into the world and I want not to be  ashamed of myself when I see my name on them. And then, as you  know, I become stupid as soon as I am obliged to write for an  instrument that I can not endure. Occasionally for the sake of a  change I have composed something else--pianoforte duets with the  violin, and a bit of the mass.\"    (Mannheim, February 14, 1778, to his father. Mozart was ill"]]]
