Another meeting was held in late August to  discuss the problem with members of the cruise ship industry. It was  agreed that additional research was needed to better define the nature  and possible causes of the problem and that a meeting should be held  to discuss possible research approaches with other professionals in  the marine mammal field. These decisions led to the meeting described  in this report.    Subsequent to the meeting reported here, the National Marine Fisheries  Service in a letter dated December 3, 1979, responded to the National  Park Service's request for a Section 7 consultation. A copy of the  NMFS's response is provided in Appendix D of this report.          INTRODUCTION      Humpback whales (_Megaptera novaeangliae_) inhabit the inland waters  of southeast Alaska, including Glacier Bay during the summer months  (June-August). In the years from 1967 through 1977, 20 to 25  individually recognizable whales were observed feeding in Glacier Bay.  In 1978, the whales entered the bay but left earlier than expected. In  1979, only a few humpbacks entered Glacier Bay. The limited  information available suggests that increased human activity in the  Bay may have been responsible, at least in part, for the observed  shift in distribution. Increased human use of coastal waters is not  limited to Glacier Bay and the movement of humpbacks from Glacier Bay  to areas outside the Bay may be symptomatic of a larger problem.    The purposes of this meeting were: (1) to review available information  concerning the nature and possible causes of the movement of whales  from Glacier Bay; (2) to review present and planned research and  management actions relating to humpback whales in Glacier Bay and  southeast Alaska; and (3) to identify additional research or  management actions that may be necessary to conserve and protect the  North Pacific population(s) of humpback whales.    The meeting was held on the 12th and 13th of October 1979, at the  College of Fisheries, University of Washington, Seattle. The meeting  agenda is included as Appendix A. Individuals who made formal  presentations at the meeting are identified on the agenda. A list of  the meeting attendees, their organizations, addresses, and telephone  numbers are listed in Appendix B.          BACKGROUND      =Distribution and Abundance of Humpback Whales in the North  Pacific=[1]    Humpback whales are seasonal migrants found in all of the world's  oceans. In the North Pacific, humpback whales winter in tropical  regions over the shallow coastal shelfs associated with the Hawaiian  Islands, Baja California, central Mexico, the Ryukyu Islands, Bonin  Islands, and Mariana Islands. They summer in cold temperate regions,  also over shallow coastal shelfs, from Point Conception, California,  north through Alaska, west through the Aleutians, and south to Honshu  Island, Japan. Calving and probably breeding occur on the wintering  grounds. Feeding is believed to occur primarily in the summering  grounds.    In Alaska, humpback whales are known to inhabit Prince William Sound,  the waters of the Alexander Archipelago, and the waters adjacent to  Kodiak Island and the Aleutians. Some whales may also overwinter in  the northern summering areas.    The distribution, movements, abundance, and habitat requirements of  humpback whales are not well known. Based upon Japanese catch  statistics, the pre-exploitation population of humpback whales in the  North Pacific is estimated to have been approximately 15,000. Much of  the exploitation of humpback whales occurred in the twentieth century,  especially during the early 1960's. A small number of whaling stations  established in southeast Alaska took humpbacks between 1907 and 1922.  In 1966, the International Whaling Commission imposed a worldwide ban  on the taking of humpback whales.    The present population of humpback whales in the North Pacific is  estimated to be about 1,000 animals. The number occurring in tropical  waters during the winter is thought to be about 600-700 in Hawaii,  200-300 in Mexican waters, and a \"few whales\" in the western North  Pacific. More than 100 individual whales have been identified in  the inland waters of southeast Alaska during the summer. Tagging  experiments with Discovery Marks indicate movement between  the Aleutian Islands and the Western North Pacific; recent  photo-identification studies have shown movement from Southeast Alaska  to both the Hawaiian Islands and Baja (and southern coastal) Mexico.  There is no substantive evidence to indicate whether the number of  humpback whales, on either summer or winter grounds, in the North  Pacific is increasing or decreasing.

GLACIER BAY, ALASKA]        SHOWING FORMER POSITIONS OF TERMINI 1760-1966        (from Hale and Wright, 1979)      =Glacier Bay=[2]    Glacier Bay is located near the north end of the Alexander Archipelago  (Figures 1 and 2). The Bay opens into Cross Sound and Icy Strait of  the Inside Passage of southeast Alaska. When Vancouver discovered the  area in 1780, glacial ice filled the Bay to its mouth (Figure 3). In  1891, when the Bay was first mapped, Muir Inlet was still filled with  ice. Today the ice has retreated up the right (Muir Inlet) arm of the  \"Y\" shaped Bay to tide-water levels. Recently, glacial ice has started  to readvance in the upper reaches of the west inlets of the Bay.    The Bay is defined by shallow sills at its entrance and the entrance  to Muir Inlet. Constricted channels in which tidal currents are  locally strong occur between sediment covered shores in the lower end  of the Bay and the east (Muir) inlet. Deep, unconstricted bedrock  channels and basins with weak currents occur in mid-Bay and the west  inlet. These features and the configuration of the bay produce a tidal  range of 8 meters. There is reduced mixing of waters within the Bay  and between the Bay and Cross Sound/Icy Strait. Annual precipitation  up to 4 meters, coupled with glacial melt water, create a surface  layer and flow of cold fresh water out of the Bay. Strong flood tides  push sea water into the Bay over the sills. The dynamics of the flow  may effect the behavior and timing of the movement of whales into (on  flood tides) and out of (on ebb tides) the Bay (see below).    During the winter, an increase in sea water flow and mixing occur.  Increased nutrient levels and sunlight in spring/summer provide  sufficient nutrients and energy for phytoplankton \"blooms\" to occur.  In turn, zooplankters appear, especially in the open areas of mid and  lower Bay (e.g., euphausiids) and along glacial ice faces (e.g.,  mysids and amphipods). By autumn, plankton concentrations diminish as  light and nutrient levels decrease. Small schooling fish, (e.g.,  capelin, _Mallotus villosus_ and Pacific sand lance, _Ammodytes  hexapterus_), feed on the plankton when it becomes available. Both  fish and plankton are consumed by humpback whales as well as by other  predators. Other marine mammal species reported in the Bay are harbor  seals (_Phoca vitulina_), harbor porpoise (_Phocoena phocoena_),  killer whales (_Orcinus orca_), and minke whales (_Balaenoptera  acutorostrata_).        [Footnote 2: This summary is based on information provided at        the meeting by Mr. Gregory Streveler.]      =Humpback Whales in Glacier Bay=[3]    The distribution in and use of Glacier Bay by humpback whales was not  well known until Charles and Virginia Jurasz began observations in  1973. Prior to this, only personal recollections of Park Service  employees of the occurrence of humpback whales in the 1950's and the  1960's exist. In 1967, 60 identifiable humpback whales were observed  in three southeast Alaskan areas, i.e., Lynn Canal, Frederick Sound,  and Glacier Bay. The number of identifiable whales remained relatively  constant until 1974 in Lynn Canal, and 1978 (July 17) in Glacier Bay  (Tables 1-3). In the respective areas, the number of identified whales  decreased from 15 and 19 to 1 and 3, respectively. Concurrently, the  number of identified whales sighted in Frederick Sound increased.

Taveta forest has been often described by pens far abler than mine, so I  will not attempt to do this. It is inhabited by a most friendly tribe of  savages, who at the time of my visit to them possessed sufficient food  to be able to supply the wants of my caravan. I therefore made it a base  at which I could leave the major part of my following, and from which I  could with comfort and safety venture forth on shooting trips,  accompanied by only a few men.    The first of these excursions was made to the shores of Lake Jipe, six  hours' march from Taveta, for the purpose of shooting hippos. I took  with me my whole battery and thirteen men. This unlucky number perhaps  influenced my fortunes, for I returned to Taveta empty handed and fever  stricken, after a stay on the shores of the lake lasting some days.  However, my experiences were interesting, if only because they were in  great measure the result of ignorance. Up to this time my sporting  experience had dealt only with snipe and turkey shooting in Florida, for  on my road from the coast, the little game seen was too wary to give me  a chance of putting a rifle to my shoulder.    The shores of Lake Jipe, where I pitched my tent, were quite flat and  separated from the open water of the lake by a wide belt of swamp  growth. I had brought with me, for the purpose of constructing a raft,  several bundles of the stems of a large palm growing in Taveta. These  were dry and as light as cork. In a few hours' time my men constructed a  raft, fifteen feet in length and five feet in width. On trial, it was  found capable of supporting two men, but even with this light load it  sank some inches below the surface of the water. I fastened a deal box  on the forward end as seat, and instructed one of the men, who said he  understood boatman's work, to stand in the stern and punt the craft  along with a pole. During the night my slumbers were constantly  disturbed by the deep, ominous grunting of hippopotami, which, as if to  show their contempt for my prowess, chose a path to their feeding  grounds which led them within a few yards of my camp. The night, though  starlit, was too dark for a shot, so I curbed my impatience till the  morning.    As most people are aware, the day begins in the tropics as nearly as  possible at 6 o'clock and lasts twelve hours. Two hours before dawn I  was up and fortifying myself against the damp morning air with a good  breakfast of roast chicken, rice and coffee. My men, wrapped in their  thin cotton shirts, lay about the fires on the damp ground, seemingly  unmindful of rheumatism and fever, and only desirous to sleep as long  as possible. I awoke my crew at a little after 5, and he, unassisted,  launched the raft. The swamp grass buoyed it up manfully, so that it  looked as if it disdained to touch the yellow waters of the lake. When  it had been pushed along till the water was found to be two feet deep, I  had myself carried to the raft and seated myself on the box. I was clad  only in a flannel shirt, and carried my .577 with ten rounds of  ammunition. As we slowly started on our way, my men woke up one by one,  and shouted cheering words to us, such as, \"Look out for the  crocodiles!\" \"If master dies, who'll pay us!\" These cries, added to the  dismal chill of the air and my boatman's only too apparent dislike of  his job, almost caused me to turn back; but, of course, that was out of  the question.    Half an hour from the shore found me on the edge of the open water, and,  as if to endorse my undertaking, day began to break. That sunrise!  Opposite me the rough outlines of the Ugucno Mountains, rising several  thousand feet, lost their shadows one by one, and far to the right  towered Mt. Kilimanjaro, nearly four miles high, its snowy rounded top  roseate with the soft light of dawn. But in Africa at least one's  higher sensibilities are dulled by the animal side of his nature, and I  fear I welcomed the sun more for the warmth of its rays than for the  beautiful and fleeting vision it produced. Then the hippos! While the  sun was rising my raft was not at rest, but was being propelled by slow  strong strokes toward the center of the lake, and as the darkness  lessened I saw the surface of the lake dotted here and there by spots,  which soon resolved themselves into the black, box-like heads of my  game. They were to all appearance motionless and appeared quite  unconscious or indifferent to the presence, in their particular domain,  of our strange craft and its burden.    I approached them steadily, going more slowly as the water grew deeper,  and more time was needed for the pulling out and dipping in of the pole.  When, however, I had reached a position some 150 yards from the nearest  group, five in number, they all with a loud snort faced me. I kept on,  despite the ardent prayer of the boatman, and when within 100 yards, and  upon seeing three of the hippos disappear beneath the surface, I took  careful aim and fired at the nearest of the remaining two. I could see  the splash of my bullet as it skipped harmlessly along the surface of  the lake, and knew I had missed. At once all heads in sight disappeared.  There must have been fifty in view when the sun rose. Presently, one by  one, they reappeared, and this time, as if impelled by curiosity, came  much closer than before. I took aim at one not fifty yards away, and  could hear the thud of the bullet as it struck. I thought, as the hippo  at once disappeared, that it was done for. I had not yet learned that  the brain of these animals is very small, and that the only fatal shot  is under the ear.    After this shot, as after my first, all heads vanished, but this time I  had to wait much longer ere they ventured to show themselves. When they  did reappear, however, it was too close for comfort. One great head,  blinking its small eyes and holding its little horselike ears at  attention, was not twenty feet away, and another was still closer on my  other side. While hesitating at which to shoot I lost my opportunity,  for they both ducked simultaneously.    I was riveted to my uncomfortable seat, and I could hear my boatman  murmuring \"Allah!\" with fright, when slowly, but steadily, I felt the  raft rise under my feet. Instinctively I remembered I had but one .577  rifle, and hastened, my hands trembling, to fasten it with a loose  rope's end to the raft. My boatman yelled with terror, and at that  fearful cry the raft splashed back in the water and all was again still.  One of the hippos, either with his back or head, must have come in  contact with the bottom of the raft as he rose to the surface. How far  he would have gone had not the negro screamed I do not know, but as it  was it seemed as if we were being held in mid air for many minutes. I  fancy the poor brute was almost as frightened as we were, for he did not  reappear near the raft.    I now thought discretion the better part of valor, and satisfied myself  with shooting at the animal from a somewhat greater distance. I hit two  more in the head and two--who showed a good foot of their fat bodies  above the water--in the sides. None floated on the surface, legs up, as  I had been led to expect they would do; but the men assured me that they  never come to the surface till sundown, no matter what time of day they  may have been shot. This, needless to state, I afterward found, is not  true. My ammunition being exhausted, and the sun blazing hot, I  returned to camp. I awoke the next day feeling anything but energetic;  nevertheless, I set out to see what game the land held ready for the  hunter, dissatisfied with his experiences on water. The country on the  eastern side of Lake Jipe is almost flat, but is dotted here and there  with low steep gneiss hills, stretching in an indefinite line parallel  to the lake and some three miles distant from it. I made my way toward  these hills. On the way I put up some very small antelope, which ran in  such an irregular manner that they presented no mark to my unskilled  arm.    We reached the hills, and I climbed one and scanned the horizon with my  glasses. Far to the northwest I spied two black spots in a grassy plain.  I gave the glasses to my gun-bearer and he at once said, \"Rhinoceros!\" I  had never seen these beasts except in a menagerie, and the mention of  the name brought me to my feet eager to come to a closer acquaintance  with them. The wind blew toward me and the game was too far for the need  of caution, so I walked rapidly in their direction. When I got to within  250 yards, I could quite easily distinguish the appearance of my quarry.  They were lying down and apparently oblivious to my approach--perhaps  asleep. My gun-bearer (a Swahili) now began to show an anxiety to turn  back. This desire is, in many cases, the distinguishing trait of this  race. On we went, but now cautiously and silently. The grass was about  two feet high, so that by crawling on hands and knees, one could conceal  most of his body. But this position is not a pleasant one with a blazing  sun on the back, rough soil under the knees and a thirteen-pound rifle  in the hand.    We got to within fifty yards. I looked back for the negro with my .577.  He was lying flat on his stomach fifty yards to the rear. I stood up to  beckon him, but he did not move. The rhinos did, and my attention was  recalled to them by hearing loud snorts, and, turning my head, I saw the  two beasts on their feet facing me. I had never shot an 8-bore in my  life before, so it is not to be wondered at that the shock of the recoil  placed me on my back. The animals were off before I could recover my  feet, and my second barrel was not discharged. I ran after them, but the  pace of a rhino is much faster than it looks, and I soon found pursuit  useless. I returned to the place where they had lain, and on looking  about found traces of fresh blood. My gun-bearer, as an explanation for "]]]
