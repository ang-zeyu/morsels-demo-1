HILTON      There seems to be little or no literature on the central nervous  system of this form of echinoderm. As might be expected, the general  arrangement of radial and circumoral bands are much as in sea-urchins,  such as shown especially by Delage and Herouard 1903. There are  however some interesting features which make the study of this type of  special value.    In this paper only the chief mass of the central nervous system is  considered. The more evident parts of the central nervous system are  arranged in general as in other forms. The circumoral nerves issue  from under the lantern and run along the oral, cross over at the edge  of the shell and then run along the aboral side. The five radial  nerves converge at the five ocular areas near the center of the aboral  region. The circumoral nerve ring is looped over and under parts of  the lantern. Fig. 1 shows a part of the lantern and parts of three  loops of the circumoral nerve trunk. In the center of the figure one  fifth of the lantern is drawn in and from under it a radial nerve is  shown in the lower part of the figure. To the left and to the right of  the central bony part of the lantern the union of a radial with a  circumoral nerve is shown. At the junction of each radial nerve with  the circumoral, is a little thickening which seems to be a special  cellular mass such as I have not found in other forms. Fig. 7 is a  section through a part of a circumoral strand, much enlarged. There  are only a few nerve cells, from one to two layers.    As the radial nerves leave the lantern they are quite evident in  dissected specimens as they are close to the bony skeleton with very  little connective or other tissues to obscure them. The use of aqueous  methylene blue aids in following the smaller branches. Near the  lantern the branches are small as shown in fig. 2. When the region is  reached where the upper and lower surfaces of the shell begin to fuse,  the branches become larger and more irregularly arranged, as shown in  the lower part of fig. 1 and fig. 2. After the nerve turns to run on  the aboral side there is no change in arrangement until the region of  the tube feet is reached. In the region of the tube feet the nerves  become more numerous, smaller and more regular. The general  distribution of the nerves and the arrangement of the tube feet nerves  are shown in fig. 4 which is from part of the upper end of the aboral  nerve. The holes in the skeleton for the tube feet are shown as  circles on each side of the diagram.    The general structure of the chief central nerve trunks is quite  similar as shown in sections. Figs. 6, 7 and 8. The nerve trunks have  about one to two layers of cells, the main part of the nerves are  composed of longitudinal fibers. There are not so many evident  vertical fibers from cells as found in starfish and some other forms.  This change in position of the fibers may be in part due to the  general modification of structure. Whether this arrangement leads to  other types of nerve association is a question.    When the nerve trunks are removed, stained in methylene blue and  examined with the microscope something of the arrangement of the cells  may be seen. In the circumoral and oral radial nerves the nerve cells  are thickly massed from side to side, but in the upper part of the  aboral nerve there is an evident arrangement of nerve cells in zones.  There is usually a central more or less clear zone, next on each side  a rather dense cell area and next on each side a very dense cell area,  then a narrow nearly clear zone on each side again.    As a rule slightly larger cells are found near the nerve trunks and as  some of these seem to send long branches out into the lateral trunks,  they may be motor or sensory, the association neurones are probably  the smaller cells in farther. The cells seem multipolar in most cases  and in fact much more modified than the cells of starfish or  sea-urchin. Figs. 9 and 10.

"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34098"],[0,"Science of Trapping (#2)"],[1,"placed that in attempting to reach it the animal places  its foot in the trap. The most common way is by setting the trap in  the entrance to some natural enclosure, such as a hollow log or  stump, a hollow between trees, or a hole in the rocks, or under a  stump the bait being placed in the enclosure beyond the trap. Failing  to find a natural enclosure, the trapper constructs one, using such  material as may be found on the spot. It is advisable as a rule to  make as little disturbance as possible and to give the enclosure a  natural appearance.    It sometimes happens that an animal can not be induced to approach a  bait and in such cases the \"blind set\" is resorted to,--in other  words the trap is set without bait in a trail where the animal  travels or at the entrance of its den. Failing to find such a place  the trapper carefully studies the route of the animal and selects a  place where some natural or artificial obstruction will crowd it into  a certain spot where he carefully sets his trap in such a way as to  catch the animal the next time it comes along. These blind sets are  as a rule very successful and many trappers use such methods  exclusively.    In setting steel traps, great care is advised for the one who learns  to do this most neatly, leaving everything natural is, as a rule, the  most successful. One should always be certain to get the trap in the  right position for to miss catching an animal not only means its loss  for the time being but many of them will become wiser from such  experiences and their capture will be more difficult afterwards. The  trapper is wise also who gives sufficient attention to the fastening  of the trap, thus reducing the animal's chances of escape after it is  once caught.    To properly set a steel trap on dry land one should dig a \"nest\" for  the trap, deep enough to allow the covering to be flush with the  surroundings and just a little larger than, and of the same shape as  the trap when set. This hollow should be lined with dry leaves or  moss and the trap placed therein. To make the trap rest solidly so  that there is no danger of it being tipped over also to make the jaws  set level, the spring should be twisted around towards the jaw which  is held down by the trigger or \"dog\". The trap should then be covered  with some light, dry material in keeping with the surroundings, a few  dead leaves or a sheet of paper being used first to prevent the  covering from rolling under the pan and in that way prevent the trap  from springing. Instead of doing this some trappers place a bunch of  cotton or dry moss under the pan but I do not think this advisable.      [Illustration: Trap Set in Correct Position at Entrance of Den.]    In all cases when setting traps at dens, on trails or at the  entrances of enclosures, the trap should be so placed that the jaws  will be lengthwise of the animal's approach so that it will step  between the jaws and not over one of them. If the setting is reversed  the rising jaw will sometimes throw the animal's foot out of the  trap.    There are various good methods of fastening and the proper one to use  depends on the nature of the surrounding and the species of animal  that one is setting for. Water animals should be drowned as quickly  as possible after they are caught and in order to secure this result  the \"sliding pole\" is used. This is simply an inclined pole leading  into deep water and of a size that will enable the ring of the trap  chain to travel easily its entire length. The most common way of  using the sliding pole is to thrust the small end into the bed of the  stream and fasten the other end securely to the bank. The pole should  have a few branches near the small end to prevent the ring from  sliding off. All water animals when caught in traps plunge into deep  water immediately and the ring of the trap chain sliding down the  pole makes it impossible for the captured animal to again regain the  shore. In order to make this outfit more certain when setting for  large animals such as otters and beavers, a stone of six or eight  pounds should be tied firmly to the chain but not near enough to the  trap to interfere with the action of the swivel.    In trapping for muskrats and mink the usual practice is to simply  stake the trap the length of the chain into the deepest water  available, the weight of the trap being sufficient to hold the animal  under water.    For land animals the trap may be fastened to a \"clog\". This is simply  a chunk of wood, a pole, brush or stone, the object being to hamper  the animal in its movements and prevent it from getting a dead pull  on the trap and chain. In fastening to the clog the staple may be  used or the chain may be dropped through the ring so as to form a  loop which is slipped over the clog, a few snags being left stand to  prevent the chain from being drawn over the end. When setting for  bears the ring is slipped over the clog,--a pole,--and fastened with  a spike or wedge. Some trappers prefer to use a pronged iron drag and  this is especially desirable when trapping for the more cunning  animals such as the fox, coyote and wolf as the drag may be covered  without leaving much sign. A stone may be used in the same manner by  securing with wire to the end of the chain.    For the animals mentioned the traps are sometimes staked down  solidly, the stake being driven out of sight but this gives the  animal a dead pull and they will sometimes escape.    Such of the fur-bearers as are likely to escape by gnawing or  twisting off a foot may sometimes be held securely by the use of the  \"spring pole\" or better still, the \"balance pole\". The spring pole is  a small springy sapling, trimmed of its branches and planted firmly  in the ground. The trap is fastened to the small end which is drawn  down and held in that position by being hooked lightly under a  crotched stake or a link of the chain may be hooked to a headless  nail driven in the side of the stake. In theory this device works  nicely but in practice it is not found to be perfect as the wood will  lose its \"spring\" if kept bent for some time, especially in freezing  weather.      [Illustration: The Balance Pole.]    The balance pole is more faithful in its action. It is simply a long  slender pole fastened in a crotch or tied to the side of a sapling,  the trap being secured to the small end. It is so balanced that the  weight of the butt will not only lift the trap but the captured  animal as well. It is fastened down in the same way as the spring  pole and is released by the struggles of the animal.    In order to keep steel traps in perfect working order they should  have a certain amount of attention. Repairs will be necessary at  times and before the trapping season commences one should look them  all over and see that they are in good condition. The triggers should  be so adjusted that the pan will set level. All parts should work  freely and the trap should neither spring too easily nor too hard.  Rust on traps is not desirable and may be prevented to a great extent  by boiling the traps occasionally in a solution of evergreen boughs,  maple, willow or oak bark or walnut hulls. This will give the traps a  blue-black color and they will not rust for a considerable length of  time. New traps will not take the color very well but they should be  boiled just the same to remove the oil also the varnish with which  some manufacturers coat their traps. Some trappers smoke their traps  before setting believing that the odor of the smoke will smother that  of the metal. This however is not in my opinion a good idea as clean  iron has no odor and the smell of smoke enables the animal to locate  the trap, thus having just the opposite of the effect desired.    Others again, grease or oil the traps which is also bad for the same  reason and another thing worth considering is the fact that a greased  trap does not have as good a grip as one which has not been so  treated. For my own part I would rather have my traps red with rust  than to have them oiled, and if it is necessary to oil the joints of  a stiff working trap, use some oil having practically no odor, never  strong smelling substances such as kerosene.    As to the number of traps that one can handle, this depends on  conditions. The kind of animals that one intends to trap for, the  nature of the country, the method of setting and tending traps, the  amount of fur to be found, etc., must all be considered. The muskrat  trapper who is in a good location where traps may be set from a boat  or in the marshes where muskrat houses are plentiful as on some parts  of the Atlantic Coast, can easily handle from seventy-five to a  hundred or more traps, looking at them once a day. The marten  trappers of the Northwest sometimes use five or six hundred traps,  but the traps are not set far apart and the trapper spends a number  of days in going over the line. In the thickly settled districts  there are comparatively few who use more than five or six dozen traps  for they must be seen each day, and for beginners from two to three  dozen traps will be sufficient.    As before mentioned, steel traps are made in various sizes so that  they may be used for all animals, from the smallest to the largest.    The No. 0 is the smallest size and is intended for such small animals  as the pocket gopher, the rat and the weasel. If the spring is of  fair strength as it is in the higher grades they may also be used for  muskrat and marten. They are used extensively by the marten trappers  of the Rocky Mountain region.    The No. 1 is known as the muskrat trap and is the best size for this  animal. It is also used for mink, skunk, opossum and marten.    The No. 1 1/2 is a very popular trap as its size and strength adapt  it for general use. It is known as the mink trap, but the tendency  among trappers is to use the 1 1/2 for larger game and the No. 1 for  mink. It is the best size for"]]]
