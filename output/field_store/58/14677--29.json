RANKEILLOR       XXVIII     I GO IN QUEST OF MY INHERITANCE       XXIX       I COME INTO MY KINGDOM       XXX        GOOD-BYE        CHAPTER I    I SET OFF UPON MY JOURNEY TO THE HOUSE OF SHAWS    I will begin the story of my adventures with a certain morning early in  the month of June, the year of grace 1751, when I took the key for the  last time out of the door of my father's house. The sun began to shine  upon the summit of the hills as I went down the road; and by the time  I had come as far as the manse, the blackbirds were whistling in the  garden lilacs, and the mist that hung around the valley in the time of  the dawn was beginning to arise and die away.    Mr. Campbell, the minister of Essendean, was waiting for me by the  garden gate, good man! He asked me if I had breakfasted; and hearing  that I lacked for nothing, he took my hand in both of his and clapped it  kindly under his arm.    \"Well, Davie, lad,\" said he, \"I will go with you as far as the ford, to  set you on the way.\" And we began to walk forward in silence.    \"Are ye sorry to leave Essendean?\" said he, after awhile.    \"Why, sir,\" said I, \"if I knew where I was going, or what was likely  to become of me, I would tell you candidly. Essendean is a good place  indeed, and I have been very happy there; but then I have never been  anywhere else. My father and mother, since they are both dead, I shall  be no nearer to in Essendean than in the Kingdom of Hungary, and, to  speak truth, if I thought I had a chance to better myself where I was  going I would go with a good will.\"    \"Ay?\" said Mr. Campbell. \"Very well, Davie. Then it behoves me to tell  your fortune; or so far as I may. When your mother was gone, and your  father (the worthy, Christian man) began to sicken for his end, he gave  me in charge a certain letter, which he said was your inheritance. 'So  soon,' says he, 'as I am gone, and the house is redd up and the gear  disposed of' (all which, Davie, hath been done), 'give my boy this  letter into his hand, and start him off to the house of Shaws, not far  from Cramond. That is the place I came from,' he said, 'and it's where  it befits that my boy should return. He is a steady lad,' your father  said, 'and a canny goer; and I doubt not he will come safe, and be well  lived where he goes.'\"    \"The house of Shaws!\" I cried. \"What had my poor father to do with the  house of Shaws?\"    \"Nay,\" said Mr. Campbell, \"who can tell that for a surety? But the name  of that family, Davie, boy, is the name you bear--Balfours of Shaws:  an ancient, honest, reputable house, peradventure in these latter  days decayed. Your father, too, was a man of learning as befitted his  position; no man more plausibly conducted school; nor had he the manner  or the speech of a common dominie; but (as ye will yourself remember)  I took aye a pleasure to have him to the manse to meet the gentry; and  those of my own house, Campbell of Kilrennet, Campbell of Dunswire,  Campbell of Minch, and others, all well-kenned gentlemen, had pleasure  in his society. Lastly, to put all the elements of this affair before  you, here is the testamentary letter itself, superscrived by the own  hand of our departed brother.\"    He gave me the letter, which was addressed in these words: \"To the hands  of Ebenezer Balfour, Esquire, of Shaws, in his house of Shaws, these  will be delivered by my son, David Balfour.\" My heart was beating hard  at this great prospect now suddenly opening before a lad of seventeen  years of age, the son of a poor country dominie in the Forest of  Ettrick.    \"Mr. Campbell,\" I stammered, \"and if you were in my shoes, would you  go?\"    \"Of a surety,\" said the minister, \"that would I, and without pause.  A pretty lad like you should get to Cramond (which is near in by  Edinburgh) in two days of walk. If the worst came to the worst, and  your high relations (as I cannot but suppose them to be somewhat of your  blood) should put you to the door, ye can but walk the two days back  again and risp at the manse door. But I would rather hope that ye shall  be well received, as your poor father forecast for you, and for anything  that I ken come to be a great man in time. And here, Davie, laddie,\" he  resumed, \"it lies near upon my conscience to improve this parting, and  set you on the right guard against the dangers of the world.\"    Here he cast about for a comfortable seat, lighted on a big boulder  under a birch by the trackside, sate down upon it with a very long,  serious upper lip, and the sun now shining in upon us between two peaks,  put his pocket-handkerchief over his cocked hat to shelter him. There,  then, with uplifted forefinger, he first put me on my guard against a  considerable number of heresies, to which I had no temptation, and urged  upon me to be instant in my prayers and reading of the Bible. That done,  he drew a picture of the great house that I was bound to, and how I  should conduct myself with its inhabitants.    \"Be soople, Davie, in things immaterial,\" said he. \"Bear ye this in  mind, that, though gentle born, ye have had a country rearing. Dinnae  shame us, Davie, dinnae shame us! In yon great, muckle house, with all  these domestics, upper and under, show yourself as nice, as circumspect,  as quick at the conception, and as slow of speech as any. As for the  laird--remember he's the laird; I say no more: honour to whom honour.  It's a pleasure to obey a laird; or should be, to the young.\"    \"Well, sir,\" said I, \"it may be; and I'll promise you I'll try to make  it so.\"    \"Why, very well said,\" replied Mr. Campbell, heartily. \"And now to come  to the material, or (to make a quibble) to the immaterial. I have here  a little packet which contains four things.\" He tugged it, as he spoke,  and with some great difficulty, from the skirt pocket of his coat. \"Of  these four things, the first is your legal due: the little pickle money  for your father's books and plenishing, which I have bought (as I have  explained from the first) in the design of re-selling at a profit to  the incoming dominie. The other three are gifties that Mrs. Campbell and  myself would be blithe of your acceptance. The first, which is round,  will likely please ye best at the first off-go; but, O Davie, laddie,  it's but a drop of water in the sea; it'll help you but a step, and  vanish like the morning. The second, which is flat and square and  written upon, will stand by you through life, like a good staff for the  road, and a good pillow to your head in sickness. And as for the last,  which is cubical, that'll see you, it's my prayerful wish, into a better  land.\"    With that he got upon his feet, took off his hat, and prayed a little  while aloud, and in affecting terms, for a young man setting out into  the world; then suddenly took me in his arms and embraced me very hard;  then held me at arm's length, looking at me with his face all working  with sorrow; and then whipped about, and crying good-bye to me, set off  backward by the way that we had come at a sort of jogging run. It might  have been laughable to another; but I was in no mind to laugh. I watched  him as long as he was in sight; and he never stopped hurrying, nor once  looked back. Then it came in upon my mind that this was all his sorrow  at my departure; and my conscience smote me hard and fast, because I,  for my part, was overjoyed to get away out of that quiet country-side,  and go to a great, busy house, among rich and respected gentlefolk of my  own name and blood.    \"Davie, Davie,\" I thought, \"was ever seen such black ingratitude? Can  you forget old favours and old friends at the mere whistle of a name?  Fie, fie; think shame.\"    And I sat down on the boulder the good man had just left, and opened the  parcel to see the nature of my gifts. That which he had called cubical,  I had never had much doubt of; sure enough it was a little Bible, to  carry in a plaid-neuk. That which he had called round, I found to be a  shilling piece; and the third, which was to help me so wonderfully both  in health and sickness all the days of my life, was a little piece of  coarse yellow paper, written upon thus in red ink:      \"TO MAKE LILLY OF THE VALLEY WATER.--Take the flowers of lilly of the  valley and distil them in sack, and drink a spooneful or two as there is  occasion. It restores speech to those that have the dumb palsey. It is  good against the Gout; it comforts the heart and strengthens the memory;  and the flowers, put into a Glasse, close stopt, and set into ane hill  of ants for a month, then take it out, and you will find a liquor which  comes from the flowers, which keep in a vial; it is good, ill or well,  and whether man or woman.\"        And then, in the minister's own hand, was added:    \"Likewise "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4210"],[0,"Our War with Spain for Cuba's Freedom (#2)"],[1,"court of  last resort. From her malignant verdict there has been no possible  appeal, no power to which her victims could turn for help.    But the end has come at last. The woe, the grief, the humiliation,  the agony, the despair that Spain has heaped upon the helpless,  and multiplied in the world until the world is sickened with it,  will be piled in one avalanche on her own head.    Liberty has grown slowly. Civilization has been on the defensive.  Now liberty fights for liberty, and civilization takes the  aggressive in the holiest war the world has even known.    Never was there a war before in which so many stimulating deeds of  bravery were done in such a short time, and this in spite of the  fact that the public has been restless for more action. It is  almost worth a war to have inscribed such a deed of cool,  intelligent heroism as that of Hobson and his men with the  Merrimac, in the entrance to the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. That  is an event in world history, one never to be forgotten, and in  the countries of Europe quite as generously recognized as by our  own people. There is a word to say for the Spanish admiral. In his  chivalry after that act of heroism, Cervera proved himself a  worthy adversary, who could realize and admire bravery in a foe,  even when it had been directed against himself with such signal  success. Not every commander would be great enough in that  circumstance to send a flag of truce to the opposing admiral, in  order to inform him that his brave men were safe and that they  were honored as brave men by their captors.    Of another sort was the bravery of Dewey at Manila, more notable  in its results but in no other way surpassing that of Hobson and  his men. Dewey went forward in spite of unknown dangers of  torpedoes, to engage an enemy in the place it had selected as most  favorable for Spanish arms, an enemy with more ships, more men,  more guns than had the American. A day later the nation was at the  feet of Dewey and the United States had taken a position among the  powers of the world never before admitted by them. In larger  degree than ever before, from that moment the United States became  a factor in the international history of the world. At this  writing one cannot tell what will be the end of the relations of  the United States to the Philippines and the Orient, but the  solution cannot fail to be of profit to this nation. This was a  holy war for the liberty of Cuba, but like many another good deed  it is bringing its additional rewards. Cuba, Puerto Rico, the  Philippines and the Caroline islands are to be liberated, four  colonies of Spain instead of one, and the direct and indirect  profit, looked at from a purely commercial basis, will be far more  than enough to compensate the United States for the cost of the  war. The annexation of the Hawaiian islands as a war measure must  be credited to the same cause, for the success of that effort  under any other circumstances was problematical.    Yet another sort of bravery was that in the harbor of Cardenas  when the little torpedo boat Winslow lay a helpless hulk under the  rain of fire from the shore batteries, without rudder or engine to  serve, and the Hudson, a mere tugboat with a few little guns on  deck, stood by for forty minutes to pass a hawser and tow the  disabled vessel out of range. Both were riddled, the Winslow had  half her total complement of men killed and wounded by a single  shell, but there was no faltering, and they all worked away as  coolly as if nothing were happening.    If one started to catalogue the instances of personal bravery that  the war brought out in its first few months, the list would be a  cumbersome one. It is enough here to say that there have been a  hundred times when personal courage was needed to be shown, and  never a moment's hesitancy on the part of any man to whom the call  came. Furthermore, in every case in which a particularly hazardous  undertaking was contemplated, and volunteers were called for, the  number offering has been in every instance far more than was  needed. This was eminently notable on the occasion of Hobson's  sinking of the Merrimac, when more than a thousand in the fleet  volunteered for a service requiring but six, and from which it  seemed impossible that any could come out alive.    The public must know all about the war, and the only avenue of  information is the press. Never before has any war been covered as  to its news features with the accuracy and energy which have  characterized this. American journalism has outstripped the world.  The expense of a news service for this war is something enormous,  with little return compensation. Yet the work is done,  metropolitan papers have from ten to twenty correspondents in the  field, and the public has the benefit. Dispatch boats follow the  fleets and are present at every battle. They must be near enough  to see, which means that they are in as much danger at times as  are the ships of the fighting squadron, far more if one remembers  that the former are in no way protected. Some of them are heavy  sea-going tugs and others are yachts. The expense of charter,  insurance and running cost amounts to from $200 to $400 a day  each, and yet some metropolitan newspapers have fleets of these  boats to the number of six.    All the foregoing facts are related in detail in the volume which  these paragraphs introduce. The only object in reiterating them  here is that they are entitled to emphasis for their prominence,  and it is desired to call special attention to them and their  accompanying matter when the book itself shall be read. The number  of those who believe we are engaged in a righteous war is  overwhelming. The records of the brave deeds of our men afloat and  ashore will inspire Americans to be better citizens as long as  time shall last. The country has proven its faith in the cause by  giving to the needs of war hundreds of thousands of young men to  fight for the liberty of others. From every corner of the land  regiments of volunteer soldiers have sprung in an instant at the  call of the President, while as many more are waiting for another  call to include those for whom there was not room the first time.  The country which can show such an inspiring movement has little  to fear in the race of progress among the nations of the world.            OUR WAR WITH SPAIN.    CHAPTER I.    A WAR FOR LIBERTY AND HUMANITY.      Again at War with a Foreign Power--Spain's Significant Flag--  Three Years Without an American Flag in Cuban Waters--Visit of the  Maine to Havana Harbor--The Maine Blown Up by Submerged Mine--  Action of President and Congress--Spain Defies America--Martial  Spirit Spreading--First Guns Are Fired--Cuban Ports Blockaded--  Many Spanish Ships Captured--Excitement in Havana--Spain and the  United States Both Declare War--Internal Dissension Threatens  Spain--President McKinley Calls a Volunteer Army.    Civilization against barbarism, freedom against oppression,  education against ignorance, progress against retrogression, the  West against the East, the United States against Spain. In this  cause the flag of freedom was again unfurled in the face of a  foreign foe, and our nation entered war against the people of  another land, carrying the star spangled banner through successive  victories in the name of liberty and humanity.    It is a proud banner, which stands the whole world over for  freedom and right, with few stains of defeat or injustice upon its  folds. The great heart of the nation swelled with pride at the  righteousness of the cause, with an assurance that eternal history  would praise America for the unselfish work. On land and sea the  boys in blue gave new fame to the flag, and their proud record in  the past was more than justified by the honors that they won.    Two wars with Great Britain and one with Mexico were the more  notable predecessors of this conflict with Spain. If to these  should be added the hostilities between the United States and the  Barbary pirates of Algiers, Morocco and Tripoli, and the scattered  brushes with two or three Oriental and South American countries,  the list might be extended. But those affairs are not remembered  as wars in the true sense of the word.    Except for protection against Indian outbreaks, the United States  had been at peace for thirty years, when the war cloud began to  loom in the horizon. It was with a full realization of the  blessings of peace that the American people yielded to the  demands, of humanity and righteous justice, to take up arms again  in the cause of liberty. There was no haste, no lack of caution,  no excited plunge into hostilities without proper grounds. The  nation made sure that it was right. An intolerable condition of  affairs resulting from years of agony in a neighbor island, with  half a dozen immediate reasons, any one sufficient, was the  absolute justification for this holy war.    Spain is the Turk of the West. Spain is an obsolete nation. Living  in the past, and lacking cause for pride to-day, she gloats over  her glorious explorations and her intellectual prowess of the  middle ages when much of Europe was in darkness. Then Spain's flag  led pioneers throughout the world. But her pride was based on  achievements, many of which, to the people of any other nation,  would have been the disgrace of its history. No indictment of  Spain can ever be more severe, more scathing, if its true  significance be considered, than the famous phrase which one of  her proudest poets created to characterize her flag of red and  yellow.    \"Sangre y oro,\" he said, \"blood and gold--a stream of gold between  two rivers of blood.\"    It is almost a sufficient characterization to indicate the whole  national spirit of Spain, to recall that this phrase is the proud  expression used by the Spanish people to glorify their own flag.  That sentiment is in no stronger contrast to the "]]]
