Werler of the Hermann Park Zoo, Houston,  Texas, contributed live individuals; Mr. Richard S. Funk contributed  information on the birth of a brood of cottonmouths; and Dr. Henry M.  Parrish contributed information on the incidence of snakebite. To  numerous other persons at leading museums throughout the United States  for information on the cottonmouths in their collections, to all who  helped with the field work in various ways, and to others at the  University of Kansas for their help and suggestions I am grateful.          SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIPS AND DISTRIBUTION      Snakes of the genus _Agkistrodon_ are relatively primitive members of  the Crotalidae, which is one of the most specialized families of snakes.  A majority of the pit-vipers are found in the Americas, but close  relatives are found from extreme southeastern Europe through temperate  Asia to Japan (_A. halys_) and southeastern Asia including Indonesia  (_Agkistrodon_ and _Trimeresurus_). Familial characters include:  vertical pupil of the eye; facial pit present between the preoculars and  loreal; scales usually keeled; short, rotatable maxilla bearing a large  hollow fang; toothless premaxilla; chiefly hematoxic venom; and  undivided anal plate.    The genus _Agkistrodon_ includes about nine species in the Old World and  three in North and Central America. Some of the primitive characters of  the genus are: head covered with nine enlarged shields or having the  internasals and prefrontals broken up into small scales; subcaudals on  proximal part of tail undivided; fangs relatively short; tail lacking  rattles. In one species, _A. rhodostoma_, the scales are smooth; and the  female is oviparous and guards her eggs until they hatch. Other species  have keeled scales and are ovo-viviparous.    There is little paleontological evidence illustrating evolution of the  cottonmouth or for that matter of crotalids in general. Brattstrom  (1954) summarized the current knowledge of fossil pit-vipers in North  America. The few fossils found of the cottonmouth are from Alacha,  Brevard, Citrus, Levy, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, Florida  (Brattstrom, _op. cit._:35; Auffenberg, 1963:202). All are of late  Pleistocene Age and well within the present geographic range of the  cottonmouth.    Of crotalid genera only _Agkistrodon_ occurs in both the Old World and  the New World, suggesting that this genus is relatively old. Schmidt  (1946: 149-150) mentioned several other closely related groups of  animals found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America, including  the reptilian genera: _Natrix_, _Opheodrys_, _Elaphe_, _Ophisaurus_,  _Leiolopisma_ (= _Lygosoma_), _Eumeces_, _Clemmys_, _Emmys_, and  _Alligator_. Of the groups of animals now confined to these two regions  the most important are the cryptobranchid salamanders, the genus  _Alligator_, and the spoon-bills (_Psephurus_ in China and _Polyodon_ in  the Mississippi drainage). Fossil evidence for these groups indicates  that existing forms common to eastern Asia and eastern North America are  remnants of a late Cretaceous or early Tertiary Holarctic fauna which  was forced southward as the climate became gradually cooler to the  north. \"Other clues suggest that both _Agkistrodon_ and _Trimeresurus_  (_Bothrops_) moved from Asia to America, one of these presumably giving  rise to the rattlesnakes.\" (Darlington, 1957:228).    The named, American kinds of _Agkistrodon_ currently are arranged as  three species: the copperhead, the cantil and the cottonmouth. The  copperhead (_A. contortrix_) is divided into four subspecies, all of  which are terrestrial. This species occurs from southern New England to  eastern Kansas and along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains, exclusive  of peninsular Florida and the delta of the Mississippi River in  Louisiana. It extends southwest from Kansas through the Edwards Plateau  of west-central Texas. Isolated populations occur in the Chisos and  Davis mountains of Trans-Pecos Texas. The cantil or Mexican moccasin  (_A. bilineatus_), probably the nearest relative of the cottonmouth (_A.  piscivorus_), is divisible into two subspecies and occupies a nearly  complementary range from Mexico south to Nicaragua. The cottonmouth  occurs throughout the coastal plains of the southeastern United States,  usually at altitudes of 500 feet or less. Two subspecies are recognized,  the eastern _A. p. piscivorus_ and the western _A. p. leucostoma_. A  revision of the genus is underway by Professor Howard K. Gloyd.    The basic pattern and various behavioral traits are common to all three  species. The young are more nearly alike in appearance than adults, the  copperhead and the cottonmouth being easily confused. Adults differ in  color, size, body proportions, habitat, and habits. In range and habitat  preference the cottonmouth more closely resembles the southern  subspecies of the copperhead, _A. c. contortrix_, which is usually found  in lowlands, near swamps and streams, but seldom in water.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    FIG. 1. Geographic range of the cottonmouth, showing marginal and  near-marginal records, based largely upon maps by Gloyd and Conant  (1943:165) and Conant (1958:336) but including additional records. The  more important of these records (from east to west) are discussed in the  following paragraphs. Crosshatching indicates the area of intergradation  between the eastern and western subspecies. Old records, indicated by  dates, and their sources are as follows: 1850's and 1891--U. S. National  Museum numbers 4263 and 32753 respectively; 1897--Hurter (1897); and  1895--Stejneger (1895:408).    The northernmost record for the eastern subspecies is in the Petersburg  area, Prince George County, Virginia (Anon., 1953:24). A sight record  (Hickman, 1922:39) near Bristol, West Virginia, probably was based on a  water-snake (_Natrix_ sp.), since the stream in which the snake was seen  flows north into the Ohio River rather than southeast through Virginia.  In North Carolina the most inland record is from the Neuse River, six to  eight miles east of Raleigh (Stejneger, 1895:408). Neill (1947:205)  reported a population in the vicinity of Dry Fork Creek on the boundary  line of Wilkes and Oglethorpe counties, Georgia. Distribution of  cottonmouths in Florida is statewide, including the Keys and other  offshore islands.    The ranges of the two subspecies, _piscivorus_ and _leucostoma_, meet  near the eastern border of Mississippi. _A. p. piscivorus_ has been  reported from Tishomingo County to the Gulf and east of the Loess Bluff  area in central Mississippi, and _A. p. leucostoma_ has been reported  from this area westward. A few specimens from along the Coast indicate  intergradation (Cook, 1962:33) between the two subspecies.    Barbour (1956:33) reported one specimen from Cypress Creek, in the Green  River drainage, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, and stated that suitable  habitat can be found in several areas east of Kentucky Lake. Hence,  cottonmouths may have entered this area via the Ohio River. Stejneger  (_loc. cit._) reported the species in the Wabash River at Mount Carmel,  Wabash County, Illinois, and mentioned a former occurrence at Vincennes,  Knox County, Indiana; but there are no recent records at these  localities. Hurter (1897) reported having seen cottonmouths in Illinois,  opposite St. Louis; Smith (1961:265) believes that this and a population  in Monroe County, Illinois, are isolated relicts, since no specimens  have been found within 50 miles to the south of Monroe County. The  specimens reported by Anderson (1941:178; 1945:274) near Chillicothe  (three miles southwest and seven miles northwest, respectively),  Livingston County, Missouri, also are thought to represent a relict  population. Hall and Smith (1947:453) reported one specimen from Jasper  County, Missouri, in the Spring River which flows through extreme  southeastern Kansas and into Oklahoma and another in the Neosho River at  Chetopa, Kansas. Both of these specimens were taken after a flood, and  no additional specimens have been taken in this region. Nevertheless,  sufficient habitat is probably available along the Neosho and Verdigris  rivers in the southeastern part of Kansas.    In Texas the cottonmouth has penetrated marginal habitat perhaps farther  than anywhere else in its range. Formerly it was thought to be limited  to the country east of the Balcones Escarpment (Smith and Buechner,  1947:8), but semiarid areas of the state have been invaded primarily via  the Colorado and Brazos River systems up to altitudes of 2300 feet. Two  additional specimens are said to have been collected along the Rio  Grande. Dr. Howard K. Gloyd (_in litt._) stated that the specimen  reported from Eagle Pass, Maverick County, is believed to have been  taken in the 1850's; and the one said to have come from the mouth of the  Devil's River is actually marked \"near Santa Rosa, Cameron County,  September 30, 1891.\" No additional specimens have been taken in that  area; and the range now probably extends no farther south than Corpus  Christi, Texas. Brown's (1903:554) knowledge of the extension of the  range of the cottonmouth west of longitude 98 deg. is probably based upon  the records along the Rio Grande reported in the nineteenth century.    Three extensions of the known range in Texas are reported herein. One  specimen was captured by Mr. Harry Green (HWG 346) along the San Saba  River, 8.1 miles west of Menard, Menard County. The other two specimens  (KU 84375 and 84376) were taken by the late Paul Anderson one and  one-half miles north of Pecan Crossing, South Concho River, Tom Green  County, and one mile west of Mertzon, Irion County.    In the hypsithermal period following Pleistocene glaciation,  cottonmouths gradually moved northward occupying areas beyond their  present range.
