She was put into the stable in November, fed on  good hay and a very small quantity of meal, it being the design to feed  her a long time. On the fourth day of January following she was sold to  a butcher for ten dollars per cwt., estimated at 1,000 pounds. She was  slaughtered at Hartford, Conn., being four years and five months old,  having eaten less than _two bushels_ of meal in her life. Her beef was  sold, all the prime pieces at twenty-five cents per pound; was a very  beautiful animal, with handling properties of the very highest order of  excellence.    In the month of January, 1862, Pocahontas, a thorough bred Heifer, was  sold and slaughtered, then five years and one month old. Her dressed  weight was as follows: hide, ninety pounds; tallow, one hundred and  twenty-seven pounds; quarters, eleven hundred and eighteen pounds; total  dressed weight, thirteen hundred and thirty-five pounds; was sold for  eight cents per pound, making $106.80. Her feed, other than hay and  grass, being twenty and one-half bushels of meal in all.      _Dairy Qualities._    Lucilla, a thorough bred Heifer, at four years old, gave in June  fifty-five pounds of milk on an average for one month; her greatest  yield in one day was fifty-nine pounds and eight ounces, and during this  month yielded fourteen pounds and eight ounces of butter in one week;  her feed, grass, with three quarts of meal daily. At five years old the  first week in June, her milk yielded fifteen pounds three ounces of  butter, on grass only.    Dorothy, a thorough bred Cow, gave thirty-nine pounds eight ounces of  milk per day, three months after calving, on grass only; and in seven  days made fifteen pounds one ounce of butter, in October.    Nymph 5th, in the month of June, 1860, gave twenty-four quarts of milk  daily for two weeks in succession, and made butter at the rate of two  pounds four ounces per day, or fifteen pounds three ounces per week, on  grass only.    Rose 2d, a thorough bred Cow, produced seventeen pounds four ounces of  butter from one week's milk in June, on grass only.      _Longevity._    Princess, a thorough bred Cow, bred regularly up to eighteen years old;  was then dried off and turned to grass for beef, and slaughtered in the  fall without stall-feeding, and made merchantable beef.    Arabella, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to seventeen years old,  and died in 1861, at eighteen years old.    Lilac 4th, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to nineteen years old,  and died in 1861.      _Scale of Points for Short Horn Bulls._                                                                       Points.

I therefore searched for proofs among the  evidence given at the trial of witches, and was, as I expected, rewarded  for my trouble. What a Cat would do now would not unreasonably be  thought clever and showing much sagacity, if not attributes of a deeper  kind.    Yet I find that at a trial for witchcraft, the following questions were  put to a man: \"Well! and what did you see?\" \"Well! I saw her Cat walk up  and try to open the door by the latch.\" \"What did you do?\" \"I  immediately killed it.\" This, which is now regarded as an everyday  example of the intelligence of the Cat, bore hardly in the evidence  against the witch. Sir Walter Scott, in his letter on \"Demonology and  Witchcraft,\" tells of \"a poor old woman condemned, as usual, on her own  confession, and on the testimony of a neighbour, who deposed that he saw  a Cat jump in the accused person's cottage through the window at  twilight, one evening, and that he verily believed the Cat to be the  devil, on which precious testimony the poor wretch was hanged.\" One more  note and I leave the subject. A certain carpenter, named William  Montgomery, was so infested with Cats, which, as his servant-maid  reported, \"spoke among themselves,\" that he fell in a rage upon a party  of these animals, which had assembled in his house at irregular hours,  and betwixt his Highland arms of knife, dirk, and broadsword, and his  professional weapon of an axe, he made such a dispersion that they were  quiet for the night. In consequence of his blows _two witches_ are said  to have died.    Since writing of the English wild Cat, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr.  Francis Darwin (brother of Mr. Charles Darwin) on board the steamboat  going to St. Servan, when, in the course of conversation, he informed me  that a wild Cat was killed at Bramhope Moor Plantation, in 1841, a  keeper having caught it in _two_ traps.    In February of this year, 1891, my kind friend, Mr. Dresser, of  Orpington, the well-known naturalist, wrote to me to know whether I  would like to have a kitten half-bred between the British Wild Cat and a  domestic she Cat, which I was unfortunately obliged to decline, fearing  it would \"make matters unpleasant\" with what I had. He very kindly  supplied me with the following particulars forwarded to him by O. H.  Mactheyer, Esq.: \"Mr. Harrison Weir can see the papa of the kitten at  the Zoo.    \"He is a young Cat (under a year old, we thought, by the teeth). He was  seen one moonlight night in company with my 'stalker's' small lean black  Cat, right away in my deer forest. We caught the papa in a trap after he  had killed a number of grouse, and not being badly hurt, I sent him to  Bartlett at the Zoo. We are thoroughly up to real wild Cats here. I have  caught them forty-three inches from nose to tail-end; tails as thick at  the point as at the root; the ears are also differently set on. Martin  Cats, Polecats, and Badgers are all extinct here, and it is ten years  since we got the last wild Cat, but three have been killed in this  district this winter.\"    I insert the foregoing as being of much interest, it having been  frequently stated that the wild Cat will not mate with the domestic Cat.  The kitten offered to me is now at Fawley Court, Bucks.    Among the numerous letters I have received from America is one from Mrs.  Mary A. C. Livermore, of Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A., who writes: \"I have  just come possessed of a black long-haired Cat from Maine. It is neither  Persian, Angora, nor Indian. They are called here 'Coon' Cats, and it is  vulgarly supposed to be a cross between a common Cat and a 'Coon.' Mine  is a rusty bear-brown colour, but his relatives have been black and  white, blue and white, and fawn and white, the latter the gentlest,  prettiest Cat I know. His tail is very bushy and a fine ruff adorns his  neck. A friend of mine has a pair of these Cats, all black, and the  female consorts with no one but her mate. Yet often she has in her  litter a common short-haired kitten.\"    Since the above reached me, I have received from another correspondent  in the United States a very beautiful photograph of what is termed a  \"Coon\" Cat. It certainly differs much from the ordinary long-haired Cat  in appearance; but as to its being a cross with the Racoon, such a  supposition is totally out of the question, and the idea cannot be  entertained. The photographs sent to me show that the ears are unusually  large, the head long, the length being in excess from the eyes to the  tip of the nose, the legs and feet are large and evenly covered with  long, somewhat coarse hair, the latter being devoid of tufts between and  at the extremity of the toes; there are no long hairs of any consequence  either within the ears or at their apex. The frill or mane is  considerable, as is the length of the hair covering the body; the tail  is rather short and somewhat thick, well covered with hair of equal  length, and in shape like a fox's brush. The eyes are large, round, and  full, with a wild staring expression. Certainly, the breed, however it  may be obtained, is most interesting to the Cat naturalist, and the  colour, as before stated, being peculiar, must of course attract his  attention independently of its general appearance.    Since the above was written, I have received the following from Mr.  Henry Brooker, The Elms, West Midford, Massachusetts, United States of  America. After asking for information respecting Cats of certain breeds,  he says: \"I have had for a number of years a peculiar strain of  long-haired Cats; they come from the islands off the coast of Maine, and  are known in this country as 'Coon' Cats. The belief is that they have  been crossed with the 'Coon.' This, of course, is untrue. The  inhabitants of these islands are seafaring people, and many years ago  some one on his vessel had a pair of long-haired Cats from which the  strain has sprung. There are few short-haired cats on the island as  there is no communication with the mainland except by boat. I want to  improve my strain and get finer hair than the Cats now have. Yellow Cats  are the most popular kind here, and I have succeeded in producing Cats  of a rich mahogany colour with brushes like a fox. They hunt in the  fields with me, and my Scotch terriers and they are on the most friendly  terms.\" This, as a corroboration of the foregoing letters and the  photographs, is, I take it, eminently satisfactory.    I have been shown a Siberian Cat, by Mr. Castang, of Leadenhall Market;  the breed is entirely new to me. It is a small female Cat of a  slaty-blue colour, rather short in body and legs; the head is small and  much rounded, while the ears are of medium size. The iris of the eyes is  a deep golden colour, which, in contrast to the bluish colour of the  fur, makes them to appear still more brilliant; the tail is short and  thick, very much so at the base, and suddenly pointed at the tip. It is  particularly timid and wild in its nature, and is difficult to approach;  but, as Mr. Castang observed, this timidity may be \"because it does not  understand our language and does not know when it is called or spoken  to.\" I think it would make a valuable Cat to cross with some English  varieties.    A correspondent writes: \"In your book on Cats you do not mention  Norwegian Cats. I was in Norway last year, and was struck by the Cats  being different to any I had ever seen, being much stouter built, with  thick close fur, mostly sandy, with stripes of dark yellow.\" I suppose I  am to infer that both the sexes are of sandy yellow colour. If so, I  should say it is more a matter of selection than a new colour. I find  generally in the colder countries the fur is short, dense, and somewhat  woolly, and as a rule, judging from the information that I am  continually receiving, whole or entire colours predominate.    Large Cats are by some sought after. This, I take it, is a great  mistake, the fairly medium-sized Cat being much the handsomer of the  two, and they are generally also devoid of that coarseness that is found  apparent in the former; while small Cats are extremely pretty, and I  understand are not only likely to be \"in vogue,\" but are actually now  being bred for their extreme _prettiness_. I have heard of some of these  \"Bantam\" Cats being produced by that true and most excellent fancier,  Mr. Herbert Young, who not only has produced a Tortoiseshell Tom Cat on  lines laid down by myself, but is also engaged in breeding more, and I  have not the least doubt he will be most successful, he having so been  in producing new colours and some of the finest silver tabby  short-haired Cats as yet seen; these short-haired Cats, in my opinion,  far surpassing for beauty any long-hair ever exhibited, and are  certainly of a \"sweeter disposition.\"    In my former edition of \"Our Cats,\" I wrote hopefully and expectantly of  much good to be derived from the institution of the so-called National  Cat Club, and of which I was then President; but I am sorry to say that  none of those hopes or expectations have been realised, and I now feel  the _deepest regret_ that I was ever induced to be in any way associated  with it. I do not care to go into particulars further than to say I  found the principal idea of many of its members consisted not so much in  promoting the welfare of the Cat as of winning prizes, and more  particularly their own Cat Club medals, for which, though offered at  public shows, the public were not allowed to compete, and when won by  the members, in many cases the"]]]
