Some men brought their hunting dogs on leashes to  follow scent trails to the animal. The men threw stones and spears with  flint points at the animals. They used wood clubs to beat them, at the  same time using wood shields to protect their bodies. They watched the  phases of the moon and learned to predict when it would be full and  give the most light for night hunting. This began the concept of a  month. Circles of stone like Stonehenge were built with alignments to  paths of the moon.            If hunting groups from two clans tried to follow the same deer,  there might be a fight between the clans or a blood feud. After the  battle, the clan would bring back its dead and wounded. A priest  officiated over a funeral for a dead man. His wife would often also go  on the funeral pyre with him.            The priest also officiated over sacrifices of humans, who were  usually offenders found guilty of transgressions. Sacrifices were  usually made in time of war or pestilence, and usually before the  winter made food scarce.            The clan ate deer that had been cooked on a spit over a fire,  and fruits and vegetables which had been gathered by the women. They  drank water from springs. In the spring, food was plentiful. There were  eggs of different colors in nests and many hare to eat. The goddess  Easter was celebrated at this time.            Later, there was farming and domestication of animals such as  horses, pigs, sheep, goats, chicken, and cattle. Of these, the pig was  the most important meat supply, being killed and salted for winter use.  Next in importance were the cattle. Sheep were kept primarily for their  wool. Flocks and herds were taken to pastures. The male cattle, with  wood yokes, pulled ploughs in the fields of barley and wheat. The  female goat and cow provided milk, butter, and cheese. The chickens  provided eggs. The hoe, spade, and grinding stone were used. Thread was  spun with a hand-held spindle which one hand held while the other hand  alternately formed the thread from a mass and then wound it around the  spindle. A coarse cloth was woven and worn as a tunic which had been  cut from the cloth. Kings wore tunics decorated with sheet gold.  Decorated pottery was made from clay and used to hold liquids and for  food preparation and consumption. During the period of \"lent\" [from the  word \"lencten\", which means spring], it was forbidden to eat any meat  or fish. This was the season in which many animals were born and grew  to maturity. Wood carts with four wheels were used to transport produce  and manure. Horses were used for transportation of people or goods.  Wood dug-out boats and paddles were used to fish on rivers or on the  seacoast.            Clans had settlements near rivers. Each settlement had a  meadow, for the mowing of hay, and a simple mill, with round timber  huts, covered with branches or thatch or turf supported by a ring of  posts. Inside was a hearth with smoke going up through a hole in the  roof, and a cauldron for cooking food. There was an upright loom in the  darkness. The floor was swept clean. At the door were spears or bags of  slingstones ready for immediate use. The King lived in the largest hut.  Gullies outside carried off excess water. Each hut had a garden for  fruit and vegetables. A goat or cow might be tied out of reach of the  garden. There was a fence or hedge surrounding and protecting the  garden area and dwelling. Buckets and cauldrons which had originated  from the Mediterranean were used. Querns with the top circular stone  turned by hand over the bottom stone were used for grinding grain.  There were ovens to dry and roast grain. Grain was first eaten as a  porridge or cereal. There were square wood granaries on stilts and wood  racks on which to dry hay. Grain was stored in concealed pits in the  earth which were lined with drystone or basket work or clay and made  airtight by sealing with clay or dung. Old pits were converted into  waste dumps, burials, or latrines. Outside the fence were an acre or  two of fields of wheat and barley, and sometimes oats and rye. Wheat  and rye were sown in the fall, and oats and barley in the spring.  Sowing was by men or two oxen drawing a simple scratch plough. The  crops were all harvested in the summer. In this two-field system, land  was held by peasants in units designed to support a single extended  family. These fields were usually enclosed with a hedge to keep animals  from eating the crop and to define the territory of the settlement from  that of its neighbors. Flax was grown and made into linen cloth. Beyond  the fields were pastures for cattle and sheep grazing. There was often  an area for beehives. This was subsistence level farming.            Pottery was given symmetry when formed with use of a wheel and  heated in increasingly hot kilns. From kilns used for pottery, it was  noticed that lumps of gold or copper ore within would melt and assume  the shape of what they had been resting on. These were the first  metals, and could be beaten into various shapes, such as ornaments.  Then the liquid ore was poured into moulds carved out of stones to make  axes [small pointed tool for piercing holes in leather, wood, or other  soft materials] and daggers, which were reheated and hammered to become  strong. Copper-tipped drills, chisels, punches and awls were also made.            The bodies of deceased were buried far away from any village in  wood coffins, except for kings, who were placed in large stone coffins  after being wrapped in linen. Buried with them were a few personal  items, such as copper daggers, flat copper axes, and awls. The deceased  was buried in a coffin with a stone on top deep in the earth to keep  the spirit of the dead from coming out to haunt the living.            It was learned that tin added to the copper made a stronger  metal: bronze. Stone hammers, and bronze and iron tools, were used to  make cooking pots, weapons, breast plates, and horse bits, which were  formed from moulds and/or forged by bronze smiths and blacksmiths from  iron extracted from iron ore heated in bowl- shaped hearths. Typically  one man operated the bellows to keep the fire hot while another did the  hammering. Bronze was made into sickles for harvesting, razors for  shaving, tweezers, straight hair pins, safety pins for clothes,  armlets, neck-rings, and mirrors. Weapons included bows and arrows,  flint and copper daggers, bronze swords and spears, stone axes, and  shields of wood with bronze mountings. The bows and arrows probably  evolved from spear throwing rods. Kings in body armor fought with  chariots drawn by two horses. The horse harnesses had bronze fittings.  The chariots had wood wheels, later with iron rims. When bronze came  into use, there was a demand for its constituent parts: copper and tin,  which were traded by rafts on waterways and the sea. When iron came  into use, there were wrought iron axes, saws, adzes [ax with curved  blade used to dress wood], files, ploughshares, harrows [set of spikes  to break clods of earth on ploughed land and also to cover seed when  sewn], scythes, billhooks [thick knife with hooked point used to prune  shrubs], and spits for hearths. Lead was mined. There was some  glassmaking of beads. Wrought iron bars were used as currency.            Hillforts now had wooden palisades on top of their banks to  protect the enclosed farmsteads and villages from stock wandering off  or being taken by rustlers, and from attacks by wild animals or other  people. Later a rampart was added from which sentries could patrol.  These were supported by timber and/or stone structures. Timbers were  probably transported by carts or dragged by oxen. At the entrances were  several openings only one of which really allowed entry. The others  went between banks into dead ends and served as traps in which to kill  the enemy from above. Gates were of wood, some hung from hinges on  posts which could be locked. Later guard chambers were added, some with  space for hearths and beds. Sometimes further concentric circles of  banks and ditches, and perhaps a second rampart, were added around  these forts. They could reach to 14 acres. The ramparts are  sufficiently widely spaced to make sling-shotting out from them highly  effective, but to minimize the dangers from sling-shotting from  without. The additional banks and ditches could be used to create  cattle corridors or to protect against spear-thrown firebrands.  However, few forts had springs of water within them, indicating that  attacks on them were probably expected to be short. Attacks usually  began with warriors bristling with weapons and blowing war trumpets  shouting insults to the foe, while their kings dashed about in  chariots. Sometimes champions from each side fought in single combat.  They took the heads of those they killed to hang from their belts or  place on wood spikes at the gates. Prisoners, including women and  children, might become slaves. Kings sometimes lived in separate  palisades where they kept their horses and chariots.            Circles of big stones like Stonehenge were rebuilt so that the  sun's position with respect to the stones would indicate the day of  longest sunlight and the day of shortest sunlight. Between these days  there was an optimum time to harvest the crops before fall, when plants  dried up and leaves fell from the trees. The winter solstice, when the  days began to get longer was cause for celebration. In the next season,  there was an optimum time to plant seeds so they could spring up from  the ground as new growth. So farming gave rise to the concept of a  year. Certain changes of the year were celebrated, such as Easter,  named for the Goddess of the Dawn, which occurred in the east (after  lent); May Day celebrating the revival of life; Lammas around July,  when the wheat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4081"],[0,"The Alchemist (#2)"],[1," of the time.  The real quality of this  comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are  conceived.  Ben Jonson had theories about poetry and the drama, and  he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with  them in his plays.  This makes Jonson, like Dryden in his time, and  Wordsworth much later, an author to reckon with; particularly when  we remember that many of Jonson's notions came for a time  definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English  poetry.  First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed  in restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent  ungoverned and irresponsible Renaissance spirit.  Jonson believed  that there was a professional way of doing things which might be  reached by a study of the best examples, and he found these  examples for the most part among the ancients.  To confine our  attention to the drama, Jonson objected to the amateurishness and  haphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and set himself to do  something different; and the first and most striking thing that he  evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours.    As Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote  his own words as to \"humour.\"  A humour, according to Jonson, was a  bias of disposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which       \"Some one peculiar quality      Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw      All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,      In their confluctions, all to run one way.\"    But continuing, Jonson is careful to add:       \"But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,      The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,      A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot      On his French garters, should affect a humour!      O, it is more than most ridiculous.\"    Jonson's comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage  personages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable  simplification of actual life be it observed in passing); and,  placing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict  and contrast, struck the spark of comedy. Downright, as his name  indicates, is \"a plain squire\"; Bobadill's humour is that of the  braggart who is incidentally, and with delightfully comic effect, a  coward; Brainworm's humour is the finding out of things to the end  of fooling everybody: of course he is fooled in the end himself.  But it was not Jonson's theories alone that made the success of  \"Every Man in His Humour.\"  The play is admirably written and each  character is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on  observation of the men of the London of the day.  Jonson was  neither in this, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that  he wrote), a supine classicist, urging that English drama return to  a slavish adherence to classical conditions.  He says as to the  laws of the old comedy (meaning by \"laws,\" such matters as the  unities of time and place and the use of chorus): \"I see not then,  but we should enjoy the same licence, or free power to illustrate  and heighten our invention as they [the ancients] did; and not be  tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few,  who are nothing but form, would thrust upon us.\"  \"Every Man in His  Humour\" is written in prose, a novel practice which Jonson had of  his predecessor in comedy, John Lyly.  Even the word \"humour\" seems  to have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman before  Jonson's use of it.  Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only a  heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,  viewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent  species of comedy in the language.  None the less, Jonson's comedy  merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in  which comedy long continued to run.  To mention only Shakespeare's  Falstaff and his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the  rest, whether in \"Henry IV.\" or in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\"  all are conceived in the spirit of humours.  So are the captains,  Welsh, Scotch, and Irish of \"Henry V.,\" and Malvolio especially  later; though Shakespeare never employed the method of humours for  an important personage.  It was not Jonson's fault that many of his  successors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated, that is,  degrade \"the humour\" into an oddity of speech, an eccentricity of  manner, of dress, or cut of beard.  There was an anonymous play  called \"Every Woman in Her Humour.\"  Chapman wrote \"A Humourous  Day's Mirth,\" Day, \"Humour Out of Breath,\" Fletcher later, \"The  Humourous Lieutenant,\" and Jonson, besides \"Every Man Out of His  Humour,\" returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies  in \"The Magnetic Lady or Humours Reconciled.\"    With the performance of \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" in 1599, by  Shakespeare's company once more at the Globe, we turn a new page in  Jonson's career.  Despite his many real virtues, if there is one  feature more than any other that distinguishes Jonson, it is his  arrogance; and to this may be added his self-righteousness,  especially under criticism or satire.  \"Every Man Out of His  Humour\" is the first of three \"comical satires\" which Jonson  contributed to what Dekker called the poetomachia or war of the  theatres as recent critics have named it.  This play as a fabric of  plot is a very slight affair; but as a satirical picture of the  manners of the time, proceeding by means of vivid caricature,  couched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that  righteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all true  satire--as a realisation, in short, of the classical ideal of  comedy--there had been nothing like Jonson's comedy since the  days of Aristophanes.  \"Every Man in His Humour,\" like the two  plays that follow it, contains two kinds of attack, the critical or  generally satiric, levelled at abuses and corruptions in the  abstract; and the personal, in which specific application is made  of all this in the lampooning of poets and others, Jonson's  contemporaries.  The method of personal attack by actual caricature  of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama.  Aristophanes so lampooned Euripides in \"The Acharnians\" and  Socrates in \"The Clouds,\" to mention no other examples; and in  English drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again.  What Jonson really did, was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an  art, and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a  dramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency.  With the  arrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in  scorn, vituperation, and invective, it is no wonder that Jonson  soon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with  his fellow-authors.  The circumstances of the origin of this  'poetomachia' are far from clear, and those who have written on the  topic, except of late, have not helped to make them clearer.  The  origin of the \"war\" has been referred to satirical references,  apparently to Jonson, contained in \"The Scourge of Villainy,\" a  satire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by John  Marston, a fellow playwright, subsequent friend and collaborator of  Jonson's.  On the other hand, epigrams of Jonson have been  discovered (49, 68, and 100) variously charging \"playwright\"  (reasonably identified with Marston) with scurrility, cowardice,  and plagiarism; though the dates of the epigrams cannot be  ascertained with certainty.  Jonson's own statement of the matter  to Drummond runs: \"He had many quarrels with Marston, beat him,  and took his pistol from him, wrote his 'Poetaster' on him; the  beginning[s] of them were that Marston represented him on the  stage.\"*         * The best account of this whole subject is to be       found in the edition of \"Poetaster\" and \"Satiromastrix\" by       J. H. Penniman in \"Belles Lettres Series\" shortly to appear.       See also his earlier work, \"The War of the Theatres,\" 1892,       and the excellent contributions to the subject by H. C. Hart       in \"Notes and Queries,\" and in his edition of Jonson, 1906.    Here at least we are on certain ground; and the principals of the  quarrel are known.  \"Histriomastix,\" a play revised by Marston in  1598, has been regarded as the one in which Jonson was thus  \"represented on the stage\"; although the personage in question,  Chrisogonus, a poet, satirist, and translator, poor but proud, and  contemptuous of the common herd, seems rather a complimentary  portrait of Jonson than a caricature.  As to the personages  actually ridiculed in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" Carlo Buffone  was formerly thought certainly to be Marston, as he was described  as \"a public, scurrilous, and profane jester,\" and elsewhere as \"the  grand scourge or second untruss [that is, satirist], of the time.\"  (Joseph Hall being by his own boast the first, and Marston's work  being entitled \"The Scourge of Villainy\").  Apparently we must now  prefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of  whom gossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was \"a bold  impertinent fellow...a perpetual talker and made a noise like a  drum in a room.  So one time at a tavern Sir Walter Raleigh beats  him and seals up his mouth (that is his upper and nether beard)  with hard wax.  From him Ben Jonson takes his Carlo Buffone  ['i.e.', jester] in \"Every Man in His Humour\" ['sic'].\"  Is it  conceivable that after all Jonson was ridiculing Marston, and that  the point of the satire consisted in an intentional confusion of  \"the grand scourge or second untruss\" with \"the scurrilous and  profane\" Chester?    We have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify  the difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the  allusions in these forgotten quarrels.  We are on sounder ground of  fact in recording other manifestations of Jonson's enmity.  In \"The  Case is Altered\""]]]
