[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/348"],[0,"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica (#2)"],[1,", Hesiod lived a farmer's life  until, according to the very early tradition preserved by the author of  the \"Theogony\" (22-23), the Muses met him as he was tending sheep on  Mt. Helicon and 'taught him a glorious song'--doubtless the \"Works and  Days\". The only other personal reference is to his victory in a poetical  contest at the funeral games of Amphidamas at Chalcis in Euboea, where  he won the prize, a tripod, which he dedicated to the Muses of Helicon  (\"Works and Days\", 651-9).    Before we go on to the story of Hesiod's death, it will be well to  inquire how far the \"autobiographical\" notices can be treated as  historical, especially as many critics treat some, or all of them,  as spurious. In the first place attempts have been made to show that  \"Hesiod\" is a significant name and therefore fictitious: it is only  necessary to mention Goettling's derivation from IEMI to ODOS (which  would make 'Hesiod' mean the 'guide' in virtues and technical arts),  and to refer to the pitiful attempts in the \"Etymologicum Magnum\" (s.v.  {H}ESIODUS), to show how prejudiced and lacking even in plausibility  such efforts are. It seems certain that 'Hesiod' stands as a proper name  in the fullest sense. Secondly, Hesiod claims that his father--if not  he himself--came from Aeolis and settled in Boeotia. There is fairly  definite evidence to warrant our acceptance of this: the dialect of the  \"Works and Days\" is shown by Rzach [1103] to contain distinct Aeolisms  apart from those which formed part of the general stock of epic poetry.  And that this Aeolic speaking poet was a Boeotian of Ascra seems even  more certain, since the tradition is never once disputed, insignificant  though the place was, even before its destruction by the Thespians.    Again, Hesiod's story of his relations with his brother Perses have been  treated with scepticism (see Murray, \"Anc. Gk. Literature\", pp. 53-54):  Perses, it is urged, is clearly a mere dummy, set up to be the target  for the poet's exhortations. On such a matter precise evidence is  naturally not forthcoming; but all probability is against the sceptical  view. For 1) if the quarrel between the brothers were a fiction, we  should expect it to be detailed at length and not noticed allusively and  rather obscurely--as we find it; 2) as MM. Croiset remark, if the  poet needed a lay-figure the ordinary practice was to introduce some  mythological person--as, in fact, is done in the \"Precepts of Chiron\".  In a word, there is no more solid ground for treating Perses and his  quarrel with Hesiod as fictitious than there would be for treating  Cyrnus, the friend of Theognis, as mythical.    Thirdly, there is the passage in the \"Theogony\" relating to Hesiod and  the Muses. It is surely an error to suppose that lines 22-35 all refer  to Hesiod: rather, the author of the \"Theogony\" tells the story of his  own inspiration by the same Muses who once taught Hesiod glorious song.  The lines 22-3 are therefore a very early piece of tradition about  Hesiod, and though the appearance of Muses must be treated as a graceful  fiction, we find that a writer, later than the \"Works and Days\" by  perhaps no more than three-quarters of a century, believed in the  actuality of Hesiod and in his life as a farmer or shepherd.    Lastly, there is the famous story of the contest in song at Chalcis. In  later times the modest version in the \"Works and Days\" was elaborated,  first by making Homer the opponent whom Hesiod conquered, while a later  period exercised its ingenuity in working up the story of the contest  into the elaborate form in which it still survives. Finally the contest,  in which the two poets contended with hymns to Apollo [1104],  was transferred to Delos. These developments certainly need no  consideration: are we to say the same of the passage in the \"Works and  Days\"? Critics from Plutarch downwards have almost unanimously rejected  the lines 654-662, on the ground that Hesiod's Amphidamas is the hero  of the Lelantine Wars between Chalcis and Eretria, whose death may be  placed circa 705 B.C.--a date which is obviously too low for the  genuine Hesiod. Nevertheless, there is much to be said in defence of  the passage. Hesiod's claim in the \"Works and Days\" is modest, since  he neither pretends to have met Homer, nor to have sung in any but an  impromptu, local festival, so that the supposed interpolation lacks  a sufficient motive. And there is nothing in the context to show that  Hesiod's Amphidamas is to be identified with that Amphidamas whom  Plutarch alone connects with the Lelantine War: the name may have been  borne by an earlier Chalcidian, an ancestor, perhaps, of the person to  whom Plutarch refers.    The story of the end of Hesiod may be told in outline. After the contest  at Chalcis, Hesiod went to Delphi and there was warned that the 'issue  of death should overtake him in the fair grove of Nemean Zeus.' Avoiding  therefore Nemea on the Isthmus of Corinth, to which he supposed  the oracle to refer, Hesiod retired to Oenoe in Locris where he was  entertained by Amphiphanes and Ganyetor, sons of a certain Phegeus. This  place, however, was also sacred to Nemean Zeus, and the poet, suspected  by his hosts of having seduced their sister [1105], was murdered there.  His body, cast into the sea, was brought to shore by dolphins and buried  at Oenoe (or, according to Plutarch, at Ascra): at a later time his  bones were removed to Orchomenus. The whole story is full of miraculous  elements, and the various authorities disagree on numerous points of  detail. The tradition seems, however, to be constant in declaring that  Hesiod was murdered and buried at Oenoe, and in this respect it is at  least as old as the time of Thucydides. In conclusion it may be worth  while to add the graceful epigram of Alcaeus of Messene (\"Palatine  Anthology\", vii 55).         \"When in the shady Locrian grove Hesiod lay dead, the Nymphs       washed his body with water from their own springs, and       heaped high his grave; and thereon the goat-herds sprinkled       offerings of milk mingled with yellow-honey: such was the       utterance of the nine Muses that he breathed forth, that old       man who had tasted of their pure springs.\"          The Hesiodic Poems    The Hesiodic poems fall into two groups according as they are didactic  (technical or gnomic) or genealogical: the first group centres round the  \"Works and Days\", the second round the \"Theogony\".          I. \"The Works and Days\":    The poem consists of four main sections. a) After the prelude, which  Pausanias failed to find in the ancient copy engraved on lead seen by  him on Mt. Helicon, comes a general exhortation to industry. It begins  with the allegory of the two Strifes, who stand for wholesome Emulation  and Quarrelsomeness respectively. Then by means of the Myth of Pandora  the poet shows how evil and the need for work first arose, and goes on  to describe the Five Ages of the World, tracing the gradual increase in  evil, and emphasizing the present miserable condition of the world, a  condition in which struggle is inevitable. Next, after the Fable of the  Hawk and Nightingale, which serves as a condemnation of violence  and injustice, the poet passes on to contrast the blessing which  Righteousness brings to a nation, and the punishment which Heaven  sends down upon the violent, and the section concludes with a series  of precepts on industry and prudent conduct generally. b) The second  section shows how a man may escape want and misery by industry and care  both in agriculture and in trading by sea. Neither subject, it should  be carefully noted, is treated in any way comprehensively. c) The third  part is occupied with miscellaneous precepts relating mostly to actions  of domestic and everyday life and conduct which have little or no  connection with one another. d) The final section is taken up with  a series of notices on the days of the month which are favourable or  unfavourable for agricultural and other operations.    It is from the second and fourth sections that the poem takes its name.  At first sight such a work seems to be a miscellany of myths, technical  advice, moral precepts, and folklore maxims without any unifying  principle; and critics have readily taken the view that the whole is a  canto of fragments or short poems worked up by a redactor. Very probably  Hesiod used much material of a far older date, just as Shakespeare  used the \"Gesta Romanorum\", old chronicles, and old plays; but close  inspection will show that the \"Works and Days\" has a real unity and that  the picturesque title is somewhat misleading. The poem has properly no  technical object at all, but is moral: its real aim is to show men  how best to live in a difficult world. So viewed the four seemingly  independent sections will be found to be linked together in a real bond  of unity. Such a connection between the first and second sections is  easily seen, but the links between these and the third and fourth are no  less real: to make life go tolerably smoothly it is most important to  be just and to know how to win a livelihood; but happiness also largely  depends on prudence and care both in social and home life as well, and  not least on avoidance of actions which offend supernatural powers and  bring ill-luck. And finally, if your industry is to be fruitful, you  must know what days are suitable for various kinds of work. This  moral aim--as opposed to the currently accepted technical aim of the  poem--explains the otherwise puzzling incompleteness of the instructions  on farming and seafaring.    Of the Hesiodic poems similar in character to the \"Works and Days\", only  the scantiest fragments survive. One at least of these, the \"Divination  by Birds\", was, as we know from Proclus, attached to the end of the  \"Works\" until it was rejected by Apollonius Rhodius: doubtless it  continued the same theme of how to live, showing how man can "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34804"],[0,"Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated (#2)"],[1,"             237        Conversion of the Peruvians                                       239        Are the origins of the American civilizations to be sought in      the Old World?                                                    241        Real significance and importance of analogies observed            243        Sacrifice                                                         245        Three stages of religious faith: animistic nature-worship,      anthropomorphic polytheism and spiritual monotheism               246        The genesis of the temple                                         249        Primitive independence and subsequent mutual interpenetration      of religion and morals                                            250        Human nature invincibly religious                                 252        The guiding principle                                             254        Farewell                                                          255          ADDENDA ET CORRIGENDA.

COMMON BASES OF CIVILIZATION  AND RELIGION.      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    My first duty is to acknowledge the signal honour which the Hibbert  Trustees have done me in inviting me to follow such a series of eminent  men as the previous occupiers of this Chair, and to address you, in the  free and earnest spirit of truth-loving and impartial research, on those  great questions of religious history which so justly pre-occupy the  chosen spirits of European society. Our age is not, as is sometimes  said, an age of positive science and of industrial discoveries alone,  but also, and in a very high degree, an age of criticism and of history.  It is to history, indeed, more than to anything else, that it looks for  the lights which are to guide it in resolving the grave difficulties  presented by the problems of the hour, in politics, in organization, and  in social and religious life. Penetrated more deeply than the century  that preceded it by the truth that the development of humanity is not  arbitrary, that the law of continuity is no less rigorously applicable  to the successive evolutions of the human mind than to the animal and  vegetable transformations of the physical world, it perceives that the  present can be no other than the expansion of germs contained in the  past; it attempts to pierce to the very essence of spiritual realities  by investigating the methods and the laws of their historical  development; it strives, here as elsewhere, to separate the permanent  from the transient, the substance from the accident, and is urged on in  these laborious researches by no mere dilettante curiosity, but rather  by the hope of arriving at a more accurate knowledge of all that is  true, all that is truly precious, all that can claim, as the pure truth,  our deliberate adhesion and our love. And in the domain of Religion,  more especially, we can never lose our confidence that, if historical  research may sometimes compel us to sacrifice illusions, or even beliefs  that have been dear to us, it gives us in return the right to walk in  the paths of the Eternal with a firmer step, and reveals with growing  clearness the marvellous aspiration of humanity towards a supreme  reality, mysterious, nay incomprehensible, and yet in essential affinity  with itself, with its ideal, with its all that is purest and sublimest.  The history of religion is not only one of the branches of human  knowledge, but a prophecy as well. After having shown us whence we come  and the path we have trodden, it shadows forth the way we have yet to  go, or at the very least it effects the orientation by which we may know  in which direction it lies.    Gentlemen, in these Lectures I shall be loyal to the principles of  impartial scholarship to which I understand this Chair to be  consecrated. Expect neither theological controversy nor dogmatic  discussion of any kind from me. It is as a historian that I am here, and  as a historian I shall speak. Only let me say at once, that, while  retaining my own very marked preferences, I place religion itself, as a  faculty, an attribute, a tendency natural to the human mind, above all  the forms, even the most exalted, which it has assumed in time and  space. I can conceive a _Templum Serenum_ where shall meet in that love  of truth, which at bottom is but one of the forms of love of God, all  men of upright heart and pure will. To me, religion is a natural  property and tendency, and consequently an innate need of the human  spirit. That spirit, accidentally and in individual cases, may indeed be  deprived of it; but if so, it is incomplete, mutilated, crippled. But  observe that the recognition of religion itself (in distinction from the  varied forms it may assume), as a natural tendency and essential need of  the human mind, implies the reality of its object, even if that sacred  object should withdraw itself from our understanding behind an  impenetrable veil, even could we say nothing concerning it save this one  word: IT IS! For it would be irrational to the last degree to lay down  the existence of such a need and such a tendency, and yet believe that  the need corresponds to nothing, that the tendency has no goal.  Religious history, by bringing clearly into light the universality, the  persistency and the prodigious intensity of religion in human life, is  therefore, to my mind, one unbroken attestation to God.    And now it remains for me to express my lively regret that I am unable  to address you in your own tongue. I often read your authors: I profit  much by them. But I have emphatically not received the gift of tongues.  By such an audience as I am now addressing, I am sure to be understood  if I speak my mother-tongue; but were I to venture on mutilating yours,  I should instantly become completely unintelligible! Let me throw  myself, then, upon your kind indulgence.      I.    I am about to speak to you on a subject little known in general, though  it has already been studied very closely by specialists of great  merit--I mean the religions professed in Mexico and Peru when, in the  sixteenth century, a handful of Spanish adventurers achieved that  conquest, almost like a fairy tale, which still remains one of the most  extraordinary chapters of history. But I shall perhaps do well at the  outset briefly to explain the very special importance of these now  vanished religions.    The intrinsic interest of all the strange, original, dramatic and even  grotesque features that they present to the historian, is in itself  sufficiently great; for they possessed beliefs, institutions, and a  developed mythology, which would bear comparison with anything known to  antiquity in the Old World. But we have another very special and weighty  reason for interesting ourselves in these religions of a  demi-civilization, brusquely arrested in its development by the European  invasion.    To render this motive as clear as possible, allow me a supposition.  Suppose, then, that by a miracle of human genius we had found means of  transporting ourselves to one of the neighbouring planets, Mars or Venus  for example, and had found it to be inhabited, like our earth, by  intelligent beings. As soon as we had satisfied the first curiosity  excited by those physical and visible novelties which the planetary  differences themselves could not fail to produce, we should turn with  re-awakened interest to ask a host of such questions as the following:  Do these intelligent inhabitants of Mars or Venus reason and feel as we  do? Have they history? Have they religion? Have they politics, arts,  morals? And if it should happen that after due examination we found  ourselves able to answer all these questions affirmatively, can you not  imagine what interest there would be in comparing the history, politics,  arts, morals and religion of these beings with our own? And if we found  that the same fundamental principles, the same laws of evolution and  transformation, the same internal logic, had asserted itself in Mars, in  Venus and on the Earth, is it not clear that the fact would constitute a  grand confirmation of our theories as to the fundamental identity of  spiritual being, the conditions of its individual and collective  genesis--in a word, the universal character of the laws of mind?    And now consider this. For the Europeans of the early sixteenth century,  America, especially continental America, was absolutely equivalent to  another planet upon which, thanks to the presaging genius of Christopher  Columbus, the men of the Old World had at last set foot. At first they  only found certain islands inhabited by men of another type and another  colour than their own, still close upon the savage state. But before  long they had reason to suspect that immense regions stretched to the  west of the archipelago of the Antilles; they ventured ashore,"]]]
