[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#2)"],[1," the night in Creil. English, Irish, Scottish soldiers, stragglers  from units still keeping some kind of order, were coming in, bronzed,  dusty, parched with thirst, with light wounds tied round with rags,  with blistered feet. French soldiers, bearded, dirty, thirsty as dogs,  crowded the station platforms. They, too, had been retreating and  retreating. A company of sappers had blown up forty bridges of France.  Under a gas-lamp in a foul-smelling urinal I copied out the diary of  their officer. Some spiritual faith upheld these men. \"Wait,\" they said.  \"In a few days we shall give them a hard knock. They will never get  Paris. Jamais de la vie!\"...    In Beauvais there was hardly a living soul when three English  correspondents went there, after escape from Amiens, now in German  hands. A tall cuirassier stood by some bags of gunpowder, ready to  blow up the bridge. The streets were strewn with barbed wire and broken  bottles... In Paris there was a great fear and solitude, except where  grief-stricken crowds stormed the railway stations for escape and where  French and British soldiers--stragglers all--drank together, and sang  above their broken glasses, and cursed the war and the Germans.    And down all the roads from the front, on every day in every month  of that first six months of war--as afterward--came back the tide of  wounded; wounded everywhere, maimed men at every junction; hospitals  crowded with blind and dying and moaning men....    \"Had an interesting time?\" asked a man I wanted to kill because of his  smug ignorance, his damnable indifference, his impregnable stupidity  of cheerfulness in this world of agony. I had changed the clothes  which were smeared with blood of French and Belgian soldiers whom I had  helped, in a week of strange adventure, to carry to the surgeons. As an  onlooker of war I hated the people who had not seen, because they could  not understand. All these things I had seen in the first nine months I  put down in a book called The Soul of the War, so that some might know;  but it was only a few who understood....          II      In 1915 the War Office at last moved in the matter of war  correspondents. Lord Kitchener, prejudiced against them, was being  broken down a little by the pressure of public opinion (mentioned from  time to time by members of the government), which demanded more news of  their men in the field than was given by bald communiques from  General Headquarters and by an \"eye-witness\" who, as one paper had  the audacity to say, wrote nothing but \"eye-wash.\" Even the enormous,  impregnable stupidity of our High Command on all matters of psychology  was penetrated by a vague notion that a few \"writing fellows\" might be  sent out with permission to follow the armies in the field, under the  strictest censorship, in order to silence the popular clamor for more  news. Dimly and nervously they apprehended that in order to stimulate  the recruiting of the New Army now being called to the colors by vulgar  appeals to sentiment and passion, it might be well to \"write up\"  the glorious side of war as it could be seen at the base and in the  organization of transport, without, of course, any allusion to dead or  dying men, to the ghastly failures of distinguished generals, or to the  filth and horror of the battlefields. They could not understand, nor did  they ever understand (these soldiers of the old school) that a nation  which was sending all its sons to the field of honor desired with a deep  and poignant craving to know how those boys of theirs were living and  how they were dying, and what suffering was theirs, and what chances  they had against their enemy, and how it was going with the war which  was absorbing all the energy and wealth of the people at home.    \"Why don't they trust their leaders?\" asked the army chiefs. \"Why don't  they leave it to us?\"    \"We do trust you--with some misgivings,\" thought the people, \"and we do  leave it to you--though you seem to be making a mess of things--but  we want to know what we have a right to know, and that is the life and  progress of this war in which our men are engaged. We want to know more  about their heroism, so that it shall be remembered by their people and  known by the world; about their agony, so that we may share it in our  hearts; and about the way of their death, so that our grief may be  softened by the thought of their courage. We will not stand for this  anonymous war; and you are wasting time by keeping it secret, because  the imagination of those who have not joined cannot be fired by cold  lines which say, 'There is nothing to report on the western front.'\"    In March of 1915 I went out with the first body of accredited war  correspondents, and we saw some of the bad places where our men lived  and died, and the traffic to the lines, and the mechanism of war in  fixed positions as were then established after the battle of the Marne  and the first battle of Ypres. Even then it was only an experimental  visit. It was not until June of that year, after an adventure on the  French front in the Champagne, that I received full credentials as a war  correspondent with the British armies on the western front, and joined  four other men who had been selected for this service, and began that  long innings as an authorized onlooker of war which ended, after long  and dreadful years, with the Army of Occupation beyond the Rhine.          III      In the very early days we lived in a small old house, called by courtesy  a chateau, in the village of Tatinghem, near General Headquarters  at St.-Omer. (Afterward we shifted our quarters from time to time,  according to the drift of battle and our convenience.) It was very  peaceful there amid fields of standing corn, where peasant women worked  while their men were fighting, but in the motor-cars supplied us by  the army (with military drivers, all complete) it was a quick ride over  Cassel Hill to the edge of the Ypres salient and the farthest point  where any car could go without being seen by a watchful enemy and blown  to bits at a signal to the guns. Then we walked, up sinister roads, or  along communication trenches, to the fire-step in the front line, or  into places like \"Plug Street\" wood and Kemmel village, and the ruins  of Vermelles, and the lines by Neuve Chapelle--the training-schools of  British armies--where always birds of death were on the wing, screaming  with high and rising notes before coming to earth with the cough that  killed... After hours in those hiding-places where boys of the New Army  were learning the lessons of war in dugouts and ditches under the range  of German guns, back again to the little white chateau at Tatinghem,  with a sweet scent of flowers from the fields, and nightingales singing  in the woods and a bell tinkling for Benediction in the old church tower  beyond our gate.    \"To-morrow,\" said the colonel--our first chief--before driving in for  a late visit to G. H. Q., \"we will go to Armentieres and see how the  'Kitchener' boys are shaping in the line up there. It ought to be  interesting.\"    The colonel was profoundly interested in the technic of war, in its  organization of supplies and transport, and methods of command. He was  a Regular of the Indian Army, a soldier by blood and caste and training,  and the noblest type of the old school of Imperial officer, with  obedience to command as a religious instinct; of stainless honor, I  think, in small things as well as great, with a deep love of England,  and a belief and pride in her Imperial destiny to govern many peoples  for their own good, and with the narrowness of such belief. His  imagination was limited to the boundaries of his professional interests,  though now and then his humanity made him realize in a perplexed way  greater issues at stake in this war than the challenge to British  Empiry.    One day, when we were walking through the desolation of a battlefield,  with the smell of human corruption about us, and men crouched in chalky  ditches below their breastworks of sand-bags, he turned to a colleague  of mine and said in a startled way:    \"This must never happen again! Never!\"    It will never happen again for him, as for many others. He was too tall  for the trenches, and one day a German sniper saw the red glint of his  hat-band--he was on the staff of the 11th Corps--and thought, \"a gay  bird\"! So he fell; and in our mess, when the news came, we were sad at  his going, and one of our orderlies, who had been his body-servant, wept  as he waited on us.    Late at night the colonel--that first chief of ours--used to come home  from G. H. Q., as all men called General Headquarters with a sense of  mystery, power, and inexplicable industry accomplishing--what?--in those  initials. He came back with a cheery shout of, \"Fine weather to-morrow!\"  or, \"A starry night and all's well!\" looking fine and soldierly as the  glare of his headlights shone on his tall figure with red tabs and a  colored armlet. But that cheeriness covered secret worries. Night after  night, in those early weeks of our service, he sat in his little office,  talking earnestly with the press officers--our censors. They seemed  to be arguing, debating, protesting, about secret influences and  hostilities surrounding us and them. I could only guess what it was all  about. It all seemed to make no difference to me when I sat down before  pieces of blank paper to get down some kind of picture, some kind  of impression, of a long day in place where I had been scared awhile  because death was on the prowl in a noisy way and I had seen it pounce  on human bodies. I knew that tomorrow I was going to another little  peep-show of war, where I should hear the same noises. That talk  downstairs, that worry about some mystery at G. H. Q. would make no  difference to the life or death of men, nor get rid of that coldness  which came to me when men were being killed nearby. Why all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3327"],[0,"Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable (#2)"],[1," are those with which we have most to do in history and in  literature.  Our own English language is made up of the dialects  of different tribes, many of whom agreed in their use of words  which they had derived from our Aryan ancestry.  Thus our  substantive verb I AM appears in the original Sanscrit of the  Aryans as ESMI, and m for ME (MOI), or the first person singular,  is found in all the verbal inflections.  The Greek form of the  same verb was ESMI, which became ASMI,   and in Latin the first  and last vowels have disappeared, the verb is SUM.  Similar  relationships are traced in the numerals, and throughout all the  languages of these nations.    The Romans, like the Etruscans who came before them, were neither  poetical nor imaginative in temperament.  Their activity ran in  practical directions.  They therefore invented few, if any  stories, of the gods whom they worshipped with fixed rites.  Mr.  Macaulay speaks of these gods as \"the sober abstractions of the  Roman pantheon.\"  We owe most of the stories of the ancient  mythology to the wit and fancy of the Greeks,   more playful and  imaginative,   who seized from Egypt and from the East such  legends as pleased them,   and adapted them in their own way.  It  often happens that such stories, resembling each other in their  foundation, are found in the Greek and Roman authors in several  different forms.    To understand these stories, we will here first acquaint  ourselves with the ideas of the structure of the universe, which  the poets and others held, and which will form the scenery, so to  speak, of the narratives.    The Greek poets believed the earth to be flat and circular, their  own country occupying the middle of it, the central point being  either Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or Delphi, so famous  for its oracle.    The circular disk of the earth was crossed from west to east, and  divided into two equal parts by the SEA, as they called the  Mediterranean, and its continuation the Euxine.    Around the earth flowed the RIVER OCEAN, its course being from  south to north on the western side of the earth, and in a  contrary direction on the eastern side.  It flowed in a steady,  equable current, unvexed by storm or tempest.  The sea, and all  the rivers on earth, received their waters from it.    The northern portion of the earth was supposed to be inhabited by  a happy race named the Hyperboreans [this word means \"who live  beyond the north\" from the word \"hyper,\" beyond, and boreas, the  north wind], dwelling in everlasting bliss and spring beyond the  lofty mountains whose caverns were supposed to send forth the  piercing blasts of the north wind, which chilled the people of  Hellas (Greece).  Their country was inaccessible by land or sea.  They lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and  warfare.  Moore has given us the \"Song of a Hyperborean,\"  beginning      \"I come from a land in the sun-bright deep,    Where golden gardens glow,    Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,    Their conch-shells never blow.\"    On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean,  dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the Hyperboreans.  They were  named the AEthiopians.  The gods favored them so highly that they  were wont to leave at times their Olympian abodes, and go to  share their sacrifices and banquets.    On the western margin of the earth, by the stream of Ocean, lay a  happy place named the Elysian Plain, whither mortals favored by  the gods were transported without tasting of death, to enjoy an  immortality of bliss.  This happy region was also called the  \"fortunate fields,\" and the \"Isles of the Blessed.\"    We thus see that the Greeks of the early ages knew little of any  real people except those to the east and south of their own  country, or near the coast of the Mediterranean.  Their  imagination meantime peopled the western portion of this sea with  giants, monsters, and enchantresses; while they placed around the  disk of the earth, which they probably regarded as of no great  width, nations enjoying the peculiar favor of the gods, and  blessed with happiness and longevity.    The Dawn, the Sun, and the Moon were supposed to rise out of the  Ocean, on the western side, and to drive through the air, giving  light to gods and men.  The stars also, except those forming  Charles' Wain or Bear, and others near them, rose out of and sank  into the stream of Ocean.  There the sun-god embarked in a winged  boat, which conveyed him round by the northern part of the earth,  back to his place of rising in the east.  Milton alludes to this  in his \"Commmus.\"      \"Now the gilded car of day    His golden axle doth allay    In the steep Atlantic stream,    And the slope sun his upward beam    Shoots against the dusky pole,    Pacing towards the other goal    Of his chamber in the east.\"    The abode of the gods was on the summit of Mount Olympus, in  Thessaly.  A gate of clouds, kept by the goddesses named the  Seasons, opened to permit the passage of the Celestials to earth,  and to receive them on their return.  The gods had their separate  dwellings; but all, when summoned, repaired to the palace of  Jupiter [Or Zeus.  The relation of these names to each other will  be explained on the next page], as did also those deities whose  usual abode was the earth, the waters, or the underworld.  It was  also in the great hall of the palace of the Olympian king that  the gods feasted each day on ambrosia and nectar, their food and  drink, the latter being handed round by the lovely goddess Hebe.  Here they conversed of the affairs of heaven and earth; and as  they quaffed their nectar, Apollo, the god of music, delighted  them with the tones of his lyre, to which the muses sang in  responsive strains.  When the sun was set, the gods retired to  sleep in their respective dwellings.    The following lines from the Odyssey will show how Homer  conceived of Olympus:--      \"So saying, Minerva, goddess azure-eyed,    Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat    Eternal of the gods, which never storms    Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm   The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.    T here the inhabitants divine rejoice    Forever.:\" Cowper    Such were the abodes of the gods as the Greeks conceived them.  The Romans, before they knew the Greek poetry, seem to have had  no definite imagination of such an assembly of gods.  But the  Roman and Etruscan races were by no means irreligious.  They  venerated their departed ancestors,   and in each family the  worship of these ancestors was an important duty.  The images of  the ancestors were kept in a sacred place,   each family  observed, at fixed times, memorial rites in their honor,   and  for these and other religious observances the family hearth was  consecrated.  The earliest rites of Roman worship are supposed to  be connected with such family devotions.    As the Greeks and Romans became acquainted with other nations,  they imported their habits of worship, even in early times.  It  will be remembered that as late as St. Paul's time, he found an  altar at Athens \"to an unknown god.\"  Greeks and Romans alike  were willing to receive from other nations the legends regarding  their gods, and to incorporate them as well as they could with  their own.  It is thus that in the poetical mythology of those  nations, which we are now to study, we frequently find a Latin  and a Greek name for one imagined divinity.  Thus Zeus, of the  Greeks, becomes in Latin   with the addition of the word pater (a  father) [The reader will observe that father is one of the words  derived from an Ayan root.  Let p and t become rough, as the  grammarians say,   let p become ph, and t th, and you have  phather or father], Jupiter   Kronos of the Greeks appears as  \"Vulcanus\" of the Latins, \"Ares\" of the Greeks is \"Mars\" or  Mavors of the Latins, \"Poseidon\" of the Greeks is \"Neptunus\" of  the Latins, \"Aphrodite\" of the Greeks is \"Venus\" of the Latins.  This variation is not to be confounded with a mere translation,  as where \"Paulos\" of the Greek becomes \"Paulus\" in Latin, or  \"Odysseus\" becomes \"Ulysses,\"   or as when \"Pierre\" of the French  becomes \"Peter\" in English.  What really happened was, that as  the Romans, more cultivated than their fathers, found in Greek  literature a god of fire and smithery,   they transferred his  name \"Hephaistos\" to their own old god \"Vulcanus,\"   who had the  same duties,   and in their after literature the Latin name was  used for the stories of Greek and Latin origin.    As the English literature came into being largely on French and  Latin models, and as French is but a degraded Latin and retains  Latin roots largely,   in our older English poets the Latin forms  of these names are generally used.  In our own generation, with  the precision now so much courted, a fashion has come in, of  designating Mars by his Greek name of \"Ares,\" Venus by her name  of \"Aphrodite,\" and so on.  But in this book, as our object is to  make familiar the stores of general English literature which  refer to such subjects, we shall retain, in general, the Latin  names,   only calling the attention of the reader to the Greek  names, as they appear in Greek authors,   and in many writers of  the more recent English schools.    The real monarch of the heavens in the mythology of both Greece  and Rome is Jupiter (Zeus-pater, father-Jove) [Jove appears to be  a word derived from the same root as Zeus, and it appears in the  root dev of the Sanscrit, where devas are gods of different  forms.  Our English word devil probably comes from the French  diable, Italian diavolo, Latin diabolus, one who makes division,-  - literally one who separates balls, or throws balls about,--  instead of throwing them frankly and truly at the batsman.  It is  not to be traced to the Sanscrit deva.]    In the mythological system we are tracing Zeus is himself the  father of many of the"]]]
