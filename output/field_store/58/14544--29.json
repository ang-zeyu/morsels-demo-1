When by your violence you drove me from your house, you set spies to  watch me in the life I had chosen. I have nothing in common with you.  I have long felt it. Now when I learn for the first time whose son I  really am, I rejoice to think that I have less to thank you for than  I once believed. I accept the terms you offer. I will go. Nay, mother,  think of your good name.\"    Sir Richard Devine laughed again. \"I am glad to see you are so well  disposed. Listen now. To-night I send for Quaid to alter my will. My  sister's son, Maurice Frere, shall be my heir in your stead. I give  you nothing. You leave this house in an hour. You change your name; you  never by word or deed make claim on me or mine. No matter what strait  or poverty you plead--if even your life should hang upon the issue--the  instant I hear that there exists on earth one who calls himself Richard  Devine, that instant shall your mother's shame become a public scandal.  You know me. I keep my word. I return in an hour, madam; let me find him  gone.\"    He passed them, upright, as if upborne by passion, strode down the  garden with the vigour that anger lends, and took the road to London.    \"Richard!\" cried the poor mother. \"Forgive me, my son! I have ruined  you.\"    Richard Devine tossed his black hair from his brow in sudden passion of  love and grief.    \"Mother, dear mother, do not weep,\" he said. \"I am not worthy of your  tears. Forgive! It is I--impetuous and ungrateful during all your years  of sorrow--who most need forgiveness. Let me share your burden that  I may lighten it. He is just. It is fitting that I go.

So--you are calmer, mother!\"              *          *          *          *          *    Sir Richard Devine, knight, shipbuilder, naval contractor, and  millionaire, was the son of a Harwich boat carpenter. Early left an  orphan with a sister to support, he soon reduced his sole aim in life to  the accumulation of money. In the Harwich boat-shed, nearly fifty years  before, he had contracted--in defiance of prophesied failure--to build  the Hastings sloop of war for His Majesty King George the Third's Lords  of the Admiralty. This contract was the thin end of that wedge which  eventually split the mighty oak block of Government patronage into  three-deckers and ships of the line; which did good service under  Pellew, Parker, Nelson, Hood; which exfoliated and ramified into huge  dockyards at Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Sheerness, and bore, as its buds  and flowers, countless barrels of measly pork and maggoty biscuit. The  sole aim of the coarse, pushing and hard-headed son of Dick Devine was  to make money. He had cringed and crawled and fluttered and blustered,  had licked the dust off great men's shoes, and danced attendance in  great men's ante-chambers. Nothing was too low, nothing too high for  him. A shrewd man of business, a thorough master of his trade, troubled  with no scruples of honour or of delicacy, he made money rapidly, and  saved it when made. The first hint that the public received of his  wealth was in 1796, when Mr. Devine, one of the shipwrights to the  Government, and a comparatively young man of forty-four or thereabouts,  subscribed five thousand pounds to the Loyalty Loan raised to prosecute  the French war. In 1805, after doing good, and it was hinted not  unprofitable, service in the trial of Lord Melville, the Treasurer  of the Navy, he married his sister to a wealthy Bristol merchant, one  Anthony Frere, and married himself to Ellinor Wade, the eldest daughter  of Colonel Wotton Wade, a boon companion of the Regent, and uncle by  marriage of a remarkable scamp and dandy, Lord Bellasis. At that time,  what with lucky speculations in the Funds--assisted, it was whispered,  by secret intelligence from France during the stormy years of '13, '14,  and '15--and the legitimate profit on his Government contracts, he had  accumulated a princely fortune, and could afford to live in princely  magnificence. But the old-man-of-the-sea burden of parsimony and avarice  which he had voluntarily taken upon him was not to be shaken off,  and the only show he made of his wealth was by purchasing, on his  knighthood, the rambling but comfortable house at Hampstead, and  ostensibly retiring from active business.    His retirement was not a happy one. He was a stern father and a severe  master. His servants hated, and his wife feared him. His only son  Richard appeared to inherit his father's strong will and imperious  manner. Under careful supervision and a just rule he might have been  guided to good; but left to his own devices outside, and galled by  the iron yoke of parental discipline at home, he became reckless and  prodigal. The mother--poor, timid Ellinor, who had been rudely torn from  the love of her youth, her cousin, Lord Bellasis--tried to restrain him,  but the head-strong boy, though owning for his mother that strong love  which is often a part of such violent natures, proved intractable, and  after three years of parental feud, he went off to the Continent, to  pursue there the same reckless life which in London had offended Sir  Richard. Sir Richard, upon this, sent for Maurice Frere, his sister's  son--the abolition of the slave trade had ruined the Bristol House of  Frere--and bought for him a commission in a marching regiment, hinting  darkly of special favours to come. His open preference for his nephew  had galled to the quick his sensitive wife, who contrasted with some  heart-pangs the gallant prodigality of her father with the niggardly  economy of her husband. Between the houses of parvenu Devine and  long-descended Wotton Wade there had long been little love. Sir Richard  felt that the colonel despised him for a city knight, and had heard that  over claret and cards Lord Bellasis and his friends had often lamented  the hard fortune which gave the beauty, Ellinor, to so sordid a  bridegroom. Armigell Esme Wade, Viscount Bellasis and Wotton, was a  product of his time. Of good family (his ancestor, Armigell, was reputed  to have landed in America before Gilbert or Raleigh), he had inherited  his manor of Bellasis, or Belsize, from one Sir Esme Wade, ambassador  from Queen Elizabeth to the King of Spain in the delicate matter of  Mendoza, and afterwards counsellor to James I, and Lieutenant of the  Tower. This Esme was a man of dark devices. It was he who negotiated  with Mary Stuart for Elizabeth; it was he who wormed out of Cobham the  evidence against the great Raleigh. He became rich, and his sister (the  widow of Henry de Kirkhaven, Lord of Hemfleet) marrying into the family  of the Wottons, the wealth of the house was further increased by the  union of her daughter Sybil with Marmaduke Wade. Marmaduke Wade was a  Lord of the Admiralty, and a patron of Pepys, who in his diary [July  17,1668] speaks of visiting him at Belsize. He was raised to the peerage  in 1667 by the title of Baron Bellasis and Wotton, and married for  his second wife Anne, daughter of Philip Stanhope, second Earl of  Chesterfield. Allied to this powerful house, the family tree of Wotton  Wade grew and flourished.    In 1784, Philip, third Baron, married the celebrated beauty, Miss Povey,  and had issue Armigell Esme, in whose person the family prudence seemed  to have run itself out.    The fourth Lord Bellasis combined the daring of Armigell, the  adventurer, with the evil disposition of Esme, the Lieutenant of the  Tower. No sooner had he become master of his fortune than he took  to dice, drink, and debauchery with all the extravagance of the last  century. He was foremost in every riot, most notorious of all the  notorious \"bloods\" of the day.    Horace Walpole, in one of his letters to Selwyn in 1785, mentions a  fact which may stand for a page of narrative. \"Young Wade,\" he says, \"is  reported to have lost one thousand guineas last night to that vulgarest  of all the Bourbons, the Duc de Chartres, and they say the fool is not  yet nineteen.\" From a pigeon Armigell Wade became a hawk, and at thirty  years of age, having lost together with his estates all chance of  winning the one woman who might have saved him--his cousin Ellinor--he  became that most unhappy of all beings, a well-born blackleg. When he  was told by thin-lipped, cool Colonel Wade that the rich shipbuilder,  Sir Richard Devine, had proposed an alliance with fair-haired gentle  Ellinor, he swore, with fierce knitting of his black brows, that no  law of man nor Heaven should further restrain him in his selfish  prodigality. \"You have sold your daughter and ruined me,\" he said; \"look  to the consequences.\" Colonel Wade sneered at his fiery kinsman: \"You  will find Sir Richard's house a pleasant one to visit, Armigell; and he  should be worth an income to so experienced a gambler as yourself.\" Lord  Bellasis did visit at Sir Richard's house during the first year of his  cousin's marriage; but upon the birth of the son who is the hero of this  history, he affected a quarrel with the city knight, and cursing him  to the Prince and Poins for a miserly curmudgeon, who neither diced nor  drank like a gentleman, departed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34259"],[0,"Hunting Dogs (#2)"],[1," the 'coon, one at a time or  in a bunch, and see them clay him. You will see the old 'coon slap  the faces off your dogs, and the shortest route home will be all too  long for them.    Killing a 'coon appears to be an art with a dog, and, of course, much  more easily acquired by a natural born 'coon hound than by a dog of  any other breed. A year-old hound of good breeding and from good  'coon hound parents, can kill a 'coon with less ado about it than  half a dozen of any other breed. It is in swimming that the 'coon is  most difficult to handle. I have known several hounds to be drowned  by 'coons in deep water. The dog goes for the 'coon, and the 'coon  gets on top of the dog's head. Down they both go, and, of course, the  dog and 'coon both let go their hold on each other. Again the dog  grabs the 'coon, and under the water they both go. This is repeated,  until the dog becomes exhausted, his lungs fill with water, and old  Mr. 'Coon seems to understand the situation exactly and seats himself  firmly on top of the dog's head, holding him under the water, till  outside assistance is all that will save him from a watery grave.    As there is but little chance--practically none--to kill a 'coon  while he is swimming, the wise old 'cooner, on to his job, will seize  the 'coon, strike a bee line to the bank, and kill him on terra  firma.    I once saw a big old boar 'coon completely outdo and nearly drown a  half dozen young hounds in Hatchie River, when an old crippled hound,  with not a tooth in his head, arrived on the scene, plunged into the  river and brought Mr. 'Coon to the bank, where the young hounds soon  killed him.    Another of the tricks Mr. 'Coon uses to advantage when closely  followed by the hounds, is to follow the meanderings of a stream  until he comes to a log reaching across to the other bank; then he  runs to the middle of the log and leaps as far as he can out into the  water, usually swimming down stream, as if he is not making for a den  or a tree in some other direction. This ruse invariably delays even  the best of 'coon hounds, as, being at about full speed, they will  run on across the log, and if the dogs know their job they will  circle out until they again find the trail; but during this momentary  bother, the 'coon is not waiting to see what they are going to do  about it. He keeps moving and I want to say that a 'coon is a much  swifter traveler than many persons suppose. He delays no time, but  keeps everlastingly at it, and it takes a speedy hound to force him  up a tree.    The 'coon may be defined as being a dwarf bear. They have many points  in common. The 'coon can lie up in his den for weeks at a time during  severely cold weather, without food or water. The only difference  between the foot prints of the 'coon and those of the bear is the  size. In shape and appearance they are exactly alike. The flesh, when  cooked, tastes similar, and not one in a thousand could tell any  difference between cooked 'coon and cooked bear, if served in same  size pieces.    By nature the 'coon is a very selfish individual. He deserts Mrs.  'Coon when his children are a day old and lets her provide for them  as best she can. The young 'coons grow rapidly, and at the tender age  of from six to eight weeks old they begin to accompany their faithful  mother in search of food. Fishes, birds, rabbits, nuts, acorns,  berries and green corn are the principal dishes on the 'coon family's  bill of fare.    At first the little 'coons stay close to their mother's heels, but  they grow more venturesome as they grow older, and soon begin to make  little journeys on their own account. This often proves their undoing  when dogs are about. Any sort of an old dog can tree or catch on the  ground a baby 'coon, but this is an advantage no true sportsman will  knowingly take.    That a mother 'coon will even brave death herself to save her babies  is evident to one who has studied the habits of the 'coon. When  closely pursued by the hounds and she and her young are all compelled  to go up the same tree, as soon as the hounds begin to bark fiercely  and the hunters arrive and begin to chop on the tree or to try to  shine their eyes, old mother 'coon picks an opening and jumps out of  the tree and is usually caught, or run up another tree close by and  then caught. But she has again saved her young, as in all likelihood  the hunters will not go back to the tree where the little coons are  serenely sitting on the leafy boughs, or never think of there being  any more coons there.    There are many reasons why the 'coon hunt is fast becoming one of the  most popular of the manly sports. The 'coon is found in many sections  of the United States. Other game is becoming very scarce. The wealthy  business man, the man of affairs who is tied to his desk six days out  of the week, can own a 'coon hound and in the stilly hours of the  night, after the day's turmoil of business, can enjoy a few hours of  the most strenuous sport now left to us and witness a battle royal  between his faithful hound and the monarch of the forest, the wily  'coon. Nothing that I can contemplate is more exhilarating or more  soothing to the nerves than the excitement of the 'coon hunt. From  the first long drawn note when the trail is struck until the hound's  victorious cry at the tree, it is one round of excitement and  anticipation. What or whose hound is leading? What direction will Mr.  Coon take? What dog will be first to tree? And then the fight! It is  simply great! And then showing the hide to the boys who didn't go,  and telling them about it for days to come.    The 'coon hunt calls for manhood. Tender weaklings cannot endure the  exertions necessary to enjoy this sport. It is too strenuous for the  lazy man or the effeminate man to enjoy. They shudder at the thoughts  of donning a pair of heavy hip boots and tramping thru swamps and  slashes, crossing creeks and barbed wire fences, thru briars and  thickets, maybe for several miles, and the probability of getting  lost and having to stay all night. But to the man with nerve and  backbone this is one of the enjoyable features. It affords great fun  to get a tenderfoot to go out for the first time and initiate him  into the \"'coon hunters' club.\" The tenderfoot will use every cuss  word ever invented and will coin new ones when the supply of old ones  becomes worn out and ineffective. He will cuss the briars, cuss the  ditches, cuss the creek, cuss the fences, cuss the swamps, cuss the  slashes, cuss the man who persuaded him to go, and finally cuss  himself for going. But when the excitement of the chase is on and  when the fight commences he becomes reconciled; and if good luck is  had he is very likely to be the next man to propose another \"'coon  hunt.\"    A half dozen hunts will make an enthusiastic 'coon hunter of any able  bodied man--and I might suggest that a half a thousand 'coon hunts  will make an able bodied man out of any man. It will throw off the  waste matter and dead tissues of the body, cause deep breathing,  arouse torpid and sluggish livers, promote digestion, and is a  general panacea for all human ailments of both mind and body.    (The foregoing contains much of value but is overdrawn even tho from  the pen of a \"Southern Gentleman\" who should be well versed in 'coon  hunting. Now and then a 'coon will go up a tree and come down or even  run out on a limb and jump off or may leap from a log across a stream  into the water. Such instances, however, are rarely done to fool the  dog. Generally when such happens, the 'coon has been feeding, going  up and down trees, etc. When a 'coon does go up a tree, jump to  another and similar tricks to fool a dog, that animal has been  trailed before and is apt to be an \"old timer.\")      [Illustration: Veteran Coon Detectives.]    Added to this is the promise of other game, if the hunter is desirous  of combining sport and profit. The skunk and opossum are common to  many sections of this country. They are less resourceful and gritty  than the 'coon, and their taking is simply a matter of choice and  method, rather than concern for opportunities. A dog trained to hunt  'coon will have no trouble attending to opossum and skunk, if his  owner desires it. Very frequently the trainer does not desire that  his dog pay attention to anything save 'coon.    Still another profitable animal taken by night hunters is the mink.  There is not so much sport in this branch, however, as the dogs  simply trail or locate them in their dens, and are captured by  digging or frightening them out, when they are dispatched by the  dogs.    A good mink dog will often locate a mink in the den during the day.  If the den has more than one entrance, is not very deep in the  ground, the animal will often run out by stamping or striking a few  licks with a mattock. The mink generally comes out at the entrance  nearest the water (quite often under water) when it can be shot, if  you are quick enough, or if the dog is an active one, caught.    When hunting at night along streams, or places frequented by both  mink and 'coon, it is sometimes difficult to tell, at first, which  your dog is after. These two animals travel about the same along  streams. Some dogs will not run mink unless especially trained while  others take naturally to mink hunting. Unless a dog is not afraid of  water, he will never make a good mink dog (or 'coon dog either for  that matter), as mink go into a great many dens both on the bank and  in the water.    Where the hunting is done in woods, considerable distance from  streams or ponds and mink seldom travel, your dog may \"pass them by\"  but if you should catch one in a trap and let him kill it, the  chances are that you will have a mink dog.    Again by hunting certain stretches of creek where mink frequent, your  dog will soon learn that you wish him to hunt these animals. A mink  holed is far from caught, especially after "]]]
