THE very title of this book may give offense. \"A New Witness for God!\"  will exclaim both ministry and laity of Christendom; \"are not the Old  Witnesses sufficient? Has not their testimony withstood the assaults of  unbelievers, atheists and agnostics alike for nineteen centuries? What  need have we for a New Witness? Every weapon that hostile criticism  could suggest, has been brought to bear against the tower of our  faith based on the testimony of the Old Witnesses; and it stands more  victorious now than ever, four square to all the winds that blow. [1]  The testimony of the Old Witnesses has outlived the ridicule of  Voltaire, the solemn sneers of Gibbon, the satire of Bolingbroke, the  ribaldry of Paine; just as it will outlive the insidious assaults of  the German mythical school, and the rationalistic school of critics,  which are now much in vogue. Such the confident boast of orthodox  Christians.    \"Meanwhile, every diocesan conference rings with the wail over 'infidel  opinions.' It grows notoriously more and more difficult to get educated  men to take any interest in the services or doctrines of the church;  * * * literature and the periodical press are becoming either more  indifferent, or more hostile to the accepted Christianity year by year;  the upper strata of the working class, upon whom the future of that  class depends, either stand coldly aloof from all the Christian sects,  or throw themselves into secularism. Passionate appeals are made to all  sections of Christians, to close their ranks, not against each other,  but against the 'skepticism rampant' among the cultivated class and the  religious indifference of the democracy.\" [2]    In the face of these facts, notwithstanding the confident boasts of  orthodox Christians about the invulnerableness of the testimony of the  Old Witnesses, it will be well for us to look a little more closely  into the achievements of Christianity, Catholic as well as Protestant,  and see if they are as satisfactory when measured by actual results, as  they are claimed to be in the fervid rhetoric of the orthodox special  pleader.    What is distinctly and commonly recognized as the Christian religion,  was founded some nineteen centuries ago [3], by the personal ministry  of Jesus Christ, and those whom he chose as Apostles. For about three  centuries it had a hard struggle for existence. The persecutions waged  against it, first by the Jews, from whose religious faith it may be  said to have sprung; and second, from the pagans, then in possession  of all secular power, well-nigh overcame it. The \"beast\" made war upon  the saints and \"prevailed against them.\" Then Constantine, the friend  of Christianity, succeeded to the imperial throne of Rome, and external  persecution ceased. Christian ministers were invited to the court of  the emperor and loaded with wealth and honors. Magnificent churches  were erected, and the hitherto despised religion became the favorite  _protege_ of the imperial government. From a precarious and wretched  existence, the Christian church was suddenly raised to a position of  magnificence and power. Nor was it long in playing the part of the  camel which, being permitted by the kind indulgence of its master to  put its head within the tent during a violent storm, next protruded  its shoulders, then its whole body, and turning about kicked out its  master. [4] So did the Christian ecclesiastical power with the civil  power. That is to say, that which was at first granted to the church  as a privilege was soon demanded as a right; and what was at first  received by grace, was at the last taken by force. On the ruins of  pagan Rome, rose papal Rome, and while the latter power did not abolish  secular government, it did make it subservient to ecclesiasticism. From  the chair of St. Peter, the Roman pontiffs ruled the world absolutely.  Kings and emperors obeyed them, and all stood in awe before the throne  of the triple-crowned successor of St. Peter.    Finally, through the mutual jealousy and ambition of the bishops of  Rome and Constantinople, a controversy arose which, in the ninth  century, resulted in a great and lasting division of Christendom into  two great ecclesiastical bodies; viz., the Greek Catholic or Eastern  Church, and the Roman Catholic or Western Church. In the Western Church  the secular or civil power continued to be regarded as subordinate to  ecclesiastical authority, a sort of convenient instrument to execute  the decrees of the church. Hence Roman Catholic Christianity drew to  itself all that prestige in the propagation of its doctrines which  comes from the authority and support of the state; and though the power  of the state was held to be subordinate to that of the church, no  one who has read our Christian annals can help being struck with the  importance of the civil power as a factor in the propagation of Roman  Catholic Christianity. The barbarous peoples who came in contact with  the Christian nations, were often compelled to accept the so-called  Christian religion as one of the terms of capitulation; and the fear  of the sword often eked out the arguments of the priests, and was  generally much more effective.    I think it proper that the above statement should be emphasized by the  following proofs:    \"In the year 772, A. D., Charlemagne, king of the Franks, undertook  to tame, and to withdraw from idolatry, the extensive nation of the  Saxons, who occupied a large portion of Germany, and were almost  perpetually at war with the Franks, respecting their boundaries and  other things; for he hoped that if their minds could become imbued  with the Christian doctrines, they would gradually lay aside their  ferocity, and learn to yield submission to the empire of the Franks.  The first attack upon their heathenism produced little effect, being  made not with the force of arms, but by some bishops and monks whom  the victor had left for that purpose among the vanquished nation. But  much better success attended the subsequent wars which Charlemagne  undertook, in the years 775, 776, and 780, A D., against that heroic  people, so fond of liberty, and so impatient, especially of sacerdotal  domination. For in these assaults, not only rewards, but also the sword  and punishments were so successfully applied upon those adhering to  the superstition of their ancestors, that they reluctantly ceased from  resistance, and allowed the doctors whom Charles employed to administer  to them Christian baptism. Widekind and Albion, indeed, who were two  of the most valiant Saxon chiefs, renewed their former insurrections;  and attempted to prostrate again by violence and war, that Christianity  which had been set up by violence. But the martial courage, and the  liberality of Charles at length brought them, in the year 785, solemnly  to declare that they were Christians, and would continue to be so. *  * * The Huns inhabiting Pannonia, were treated the same way as the  Saxons; for Charles so exhausted and humbled them by successive wars,  as to compel them to prefer becoming Christians to being slaves.\" [5]    In Denmark, during the tenth century, \"the Christian cause had to  struggle with great difficulties and adversities, under King Gorman,  although the queen was a professed Christian. But Harald, surnamed  Blatand, the son of Gorman, having been vanquished by Otto the Great,  about the middle of the century, made a profession of Christianity in  the year 949, and was baptized. * * * Perhaps Harald, who had his birth  and education from a Christian mother, Tyra, was not greatly averse  from the Christian religion; and yet it is clear that in the present  transaction he yielded rather to the demands of his conqueror, than to  his own inclinations. For Otto, being satisfied that the Danes would  never cease to harass their neighbors with wars and rapine, if they  retained the martial religion of their fathers, made it a condition of the  peace with Harald that he and his people should become Christians.\" [6]    \"Waldemar I., King of Denmark, obtained very great fame by the many  wars he undertook against the pagan nations, the Slavs, the Wends,  the Vandals, and others. He fought not only for the interests of his  subjects, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#2)"],[1,"or more of pickers-up  of unconsidered trifles, who forthwith race for the prize.  How they get  to know of its existence is a mystery.  Perhaps some strange  psychological influence is at work to prompt them to dive down a  pestilential alley for the first and last time in their lives.  Did you  ever see a millionaire groping in the gutter for a dropped coin?  His  energy is nothing to that of the book-man who has reason to suspect--why  he knows not--that here or there may perhaps lie hid and unrecognised a  volume which fashion has made omnipotent.  And his energy is not  confined to himself alone, for one decree of a naughty world changes  not--it is ever the same: What many men want, more men will search for;  what one man only has, many will want.  The path of the book-hunter is  trodden flat and hard with countless footsteps, and this is the reason  why it is so unsatisfactory to look specially for anything valuable.    We may take it, therefore, that, though hunting for books may be a  highly exhilarating pastime, it is seldom remunerative from a pecuniary  point of view.  There are, no doubt, hundreds of thousands of good and  useful volumes which can be bought at any time for next to nothing; but  they have no halo round them at the moment, and so they are abandoned to  their fate by the typical collector, who insists not only on having the  best editions in exchange for his money, but that his books shall be of  a certain description--that is to say, of a kind to please him, or which  for the time being is in great demand.    And men are pleased at various times by books of a widely different  character, as the old catalogues tell us plainly enough.  In 1676, when  William Cooper bookseller, dwelling at the Sign of the Pelican in Little  Britain, held the first auction sale ever advertised in England--that of  the library of Dr. Lazarus Seaman--works critical of the Fathers and  Schoolmen; learned and critical volumes of distressing profundity,  appealed to the comparative few who could read and write sufficiently  well to make reading a pleasurable experience.  Poetry is absent  entirely. Shakespeare and Milton are elbowed out by Puritan fanatics who  fulminate curses against mankind.  No doubt, if a book-man of those days  had been asked what kind of literature would be in vogue a couple of  centuries hence, he would have pointed to Seaman's collection and  replied, 'Books like those can never die.  So long as learning holds its  sway over the few, they will be bought and treasured by the many.'  In  this he would have been wrong, for few people care nowadays for volumes  such as these.  The times have changed utterly, and we with them.    At this same sale was a book which sold for less than almost any other,  and it lay hidden away under this bald and misleading title: 'Veteris et  Novi Testamenti in Ling. Indica, Cantabr. in Nova Anglia.'  Simply this,  and nothing more.  No statement as to date, condition or binding appears  in Cooper's catalogue, and yet this Bible is none other than John  Eliot's translation into the Indian language, with a metrical version of  the Psalms in the same vernacular, published at Cambridge, Mass., in  1663-61.  An auctioneer of the present day would print the title of this  volume in large capitals, and tell us whether or no it had the rare  dedication to King Charles II., of pious memory, which was only inserted  in twenty copies sent to England as presents.  If it had, then this  book, wherever it may be, is now worth much more than its weight in  gold, for at Lord Hardwicke's sale, held in London on June 29, 1888,  such a desirable copy was knocked down for L580.    Why this immense advance in price, seeing that probably there is no man  in England to-day who could read a single line of John Eliot's free  translation?  The reason is plain.  Since 1661 sleepy New England has  vanished like the light canoes of countless Indians, and in the busy  United States there has grown up a great demand for anything which  illustrates the early history of North America.  Had such a contingency  struck old Lazarus Seaman, he would have made his will to suit the  exigences of the case, and perhaps taken more interest in John Eliot and  his missionary enterprises than anyone did at the time, or has done  since.    It may perhaps be said that Seaman's library must have been of a special  kind, one which such a learned divine might be expected to gather within  his walls; but as a matter of fact this was not so.  Between 1676 and  1682, October to October in each of those years, exactly thirty sales of  books were held by auction in London, among them the libraries of Sir  Kenelm Digby, Dr. Castell, the author of the 'Lexicon Heptaglotton,' Dr.  Gataker, Lord Warwick, and other noted persons.  The general character  of all the seventeenth-century catalogues which time has spared for our  perusal is substantially the same. Every one of them reflects the taste  and fashion of the day, as did Agrippa's magic glass the forms of absent  friends.  Still harping chiefly on theology! as Polonius might say,  these catalogues are crammed with polemics and books of grave discourse.  Anything which could not, by hook or by crook, be dragged, as to its  contents, within the circumference of the fashionable craze, was  disposed of for a trifling sum.  Even in 1682 the learned world, or at  least our narrow corner of it, was inhabited almost entirely by  crop-eared Puritans, with sugar-loaf hats on their heads and broad  buckles to their shoes, and by Philosophers.  True!  Cromwell had gone  to his account, and Charles II. held Court at St. James's and elsewhere,  but the King and his merry companions were not reading men unless a  profound knowledge of 'Hudibras,' that book which Pepys could not abide  the sight of, could make them so.  The anti-Puritans patronized Butler,  and doted on Sir Charles Sedley, the Earl of Rochester and a few more,  who scribbled love-verses by day, and gambled and fought and drank at  night.  But these worshipped Thalia and Erato only, with music and  dancing and other delights, and knew nothing of solid hard work by the  midnight oil.  They had no books to speak of, and the few they had were  light and airy like themselves, and for the most part as worthless.    On November 25, 1678, a great sale was held at the White Hart, in  Bartholomew Close.  The books were 'bought out of the best libraries  abroad, and out of the most eminent seats of learning beyond the seas,'  or, more truthfully, had been removed from the shops of seven London  book-sellers who had combined to rig the market.  Books of all kinds  were dispersed at this sale, which continued _de die in diem_ till the  heptarchy was satisfied.  Were the members of this pioneer combination  alive now, they would weep to think that they gave away on that  occasion--practically gave away--scores of what have long since become  aristocrats among books. Americana were there in plenty, and some of  these are now so extremely rare and valuable that they are hardly to be  procured for love or money; some few, indeed, have completely  disappeared, tossed lightly aside, probably by disgusted purchasers, or  carted back again to the shops from whence they came, to be stacked once  more till they perished utterly of damp and neglect, moth, mice and  rust. On the other hand our old friends, the Puritans, revelled in grim  folios bought up at prices which, the change in the value of money  notwithstanding, would hardly be exceeded now.  Walton's 'Biblia Sacra  Polyglotta' was an immense favourite, a distinction it doubtless  deserved, and, indeed, deserves yet, though we can see that Walton must  have 'gone down' woefully in the last hundred years, when we come to  calculate the necessaries of life that could be bought then with a piece  of gold, and to contrast them with the meagre display such a sum would  purchase now. The truth perhaps, is that, although education was less  widely diffused in the days of the Stuarts, it was more deep and  thorough.  A savant was then like a huge octopus that devastates whole  districts, and daily grows fatter and more bloated at the expense of  everything that moves within reach of its spreading tendrils.    To this effect are we taught by these ancient catalogues, which,  however, do not exhaust all their interest in mere matters of prices and  fashion.  We can learn much from their pages and advertisements of the  manners and customs of our ancestors in Bookland.  It seems that there  were travelling auctioneers a couple of centuries ago who prefaced their  remarks with eulogies of the Mayor and Corporation of each town at which  they stopped, by way, no doubt, of securing their patronage.  Sales  began at eight o'clock in the morning then, and went on, with a mid-day  interval for refreshment, until late at night.  Sometimes the auctioneer  sold by the candle-end; that is to say, lit a morsel of candle on  putting up some coveted volume for competition, and knocked it down to  him who had bid the most when the light flickered out.  This was,  distinctly, an excellent method for bolstering up excitement, for every  splutter must have been good for a hasty advance, regretted very  possibly when the modicum of tallow entered on a fresh lease of life.  When not selling by the candle-end, an auctioneer would dispose of about  thirty lots in the course of an hour, and was quite willing to accept  the most trifling bids.  Business is more rapidly conducted now, for few  auctioneers stop to curse their fate, or to regale their audience with  anecdotes, as one George Smalridge, who in 1689 wrote and published a  skit on the prevalent way of doing business, says was quite the usual  custom in his day.  His tract is written in Latin, under the title  'Auctio Davisiana,' and gives a fanciful account of the extraordinary  proceedings that took place at the sale of the books of Richard"]]]
