But listen to this message, dad. It's from a Mr. Hosmer  Fenwick, of Philadelphia. He says:\"    \"'Tom Swift--Can you come on to Philadelphia at once and aid me in  perfecting my new electric airship? I want to get it ready for a  flight before some government experts who have promised to purchase  several if it works well. I am in trouble, and I can't get it to  rise off the ground. I need help. I have heard about your airship,  and the other inventions you and your father have perfected, and I  am sure you can aid me. I am stuck. Can you hurry to the Quaker  City? I will pay you well. Answer at once!'\"    \"Well?\" remarked Mr. Swift, questioningly, as his son finished  reading the telegram. \"What are you going to do about it, Tom?\"    \"I don't exactly know, dad. I was going to ask your advice. What  would you do? Who is this Mr. Fenwick?\"    \"Well, he is an inventor of some note, but he has had many failures.  I have not heard of him in some years until now. He is a gentleman  of wealth, and can be relied upon to do just as he says. We are  slightly acquainted. Perhaps it would be well to aid him, if you can  spare the time. Not that you need the money, but inventors should be  mutually helpful. If you feel like going to Philadelphia, and aiding  him in getting his electric airship in shape, you have my  permission.\"    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, doubtfully. \"I was just getting my  monoplane in shape for a little flight. It was nothing particular,  though. Dad, I think I WILL take a run to Philadelphia, and see if I  can help Mr. Fenwick. I'll wire him that I am coming, to-morrow or  next day.\"    \"Very well,\" assented Mr. Swift, and then he and his son went into  one of the shops, talking of a new invention which they were about  to patent.    Tom little knew what a strange series of adventures were to follow  his decision to go to the Quaker City, nor the danger involved in  aiding Mr. Fenwick to operate his electric airship.          CHAPTER II    MISS NESTOR'S NEWS      \"When do you think you will go to Philadelphia, Tom?\" asked Mr.  Swift, a little later, as the aged inventor and his son were looking  over some blueprints which Garret Jackson, an engineer employed by  them, had spread out on a table.    \"I don't exactly know,\" was the answer. \"It's quite a little run  from Shopton, because I can't get a through train. But I think I'll  start tomorrow.\"    \"Why do you go by train?\" asked Mr. Jackson.    \"Why--er--because--\" was Tom's rather hesitating reply. \"How else  would I go?\"    \"Your monoplane would be a good deal quicker, and you wouldn't have  to change cars,\" said the engineer. \"That is if you don't want to  take out the big airship. Why don't you go in the monoplane?\"    \"By Jove! I believe I will!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I never thought of  that, though it's a wonder I didn't. I'll not take the RED CLOUD, as  she's too hard to handle alone. But the BUTTERFLY will be just the  thing,\" and Tom looked over to where a new monoplane rested on the  three bicycle wheels which formed part of its landing frame. \"I  haven't had it out since I mended the left wing tip,\" he went on,  \"and it will also be a good chance to test my new rudder. I believe  I WILL go to Philadelphia by the BUTTERFLY.\"    \"Well, as long as that's settled, suppose you give us your views on  this new form of storage battery,\" suggested Mr. Swift, with a fond  glance at his son, for Tom's opinion was considered valuable in  matters electrical, as those of you, who have read the previous  books in this series, well know.    The little group in the machine shop was soon deep in the discussion  of ohms, amperes, volts and currents, and, for a time, Tom almost  forgot the message calling him to Philadelphia.    Taking advantage of the momentary lull in the activities of the  young inventor, I will tell my readers something about him, so that  those who have no previous introduction to him may feel that he is a  friend.    Tom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, a widower, in the  village of Shopton, New York. There was also in the household Mrs.  Baggert, the aged housekeeper, who looked after Tom almost like a  mother. Garret Jackson, an engineer and general helper, also lived  with the Swifts.    Eradicate Sampson might also be called a retainer of the family, for  though the aged colored man and his mule Boomerang did odd work  about the village, they were more often employed by Tom and his  father than by any one else. Eradicate was so called because, as he  said, he \"eradicated\" the dirt. He did whitewashing, made gardens,  and did anything else that was needed. Boomerang was thus named by  his owner, because, as Eradicate said, \"yo' nebber know jest what  dat mule am goin' t' do next. He may go forward or he may go  backward, jest laik them Australian boomerangs.\"    There was another valued friend of the family, Wakefield Damon by  name, to whom the reader will be introduced in due course. And then  there was Mary Nestor, about whom I prefer to let Tom tell you  himself, for he might be jealous if I talked too much about her.    In the first book of this series, called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle,\"  there was told how he became possessed of the machine, after  it had nearly killed Mr. Damon, who was learning to ride it. Mr.  Damon, who had a habit of \"blessing\" everything from his collar  button to his shoe laces, did not \"bless\" the motor-cycle after it  tried to climb a tree with him; and he sold it to Tom very cheaply.  Tom repaired it, invented some new attachments for it, and had a  number of adventures on it. Not the least of these was trailing  after a gang of scoundrels who tried to get possession of a valuable  patent model belonging to Mr. Swift.    Our second book, called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat,\" related some  exciting times following the acquisition by the young inventor of a  speedy craft which the thieves of the patent model had stolen. In  the boat Tom raced with Andy Foger, a town bully, and beat him. Tom  also took out on pleasure trips his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in  a Shopton bank, and the two had fine times together. Need I also say  that Mary Nestor also had trips in the motor-boat? Besides some other  stirring adventures in his speedy craft Tom rescued, from a burning  balloon that fell into the lake, the aeronaut, John Sharp. Later Mr.  Sharp and Tom built an airship, called the RED CLOUD, in which they  had some strenuous times.    Their adventures in this craft of the air form the basis for the  third book of the series, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Airship.\" In  the RED CLOUD, Tom and his friends, including Mr. Damon, started to  make a record flight. They left Shopton the night when the bank  vault was blown open, and seventy-five thousand dollars stolen.    Because of evidence given by Andy Foger, and his father, suspicion  pointed to Tom and his friends as the robbers, and they were  pursued. But they turned the tables by capturing the real burglars,  and defeating the mean plans of the Fogers.    Not satisfied with having mastered the air Tom and his father turned  their attention to the water. Mr. Swift perfected a new type of  craft, and in the fourth book of the series, called \"Tom Swift and  His Submarine,\" you may read how he went after a sunken treasure.  The party had many adventures, and were in no little danger from  their enemies before they reached the wreck with its store of gold.    The fifth book of the series, named \"Tom Swift and His Electrical  Runabout,\" told how Tom built the speediest car on the road, and won  a prize with it, and also saved a bank from ruin.    Tom had to struggle against odds, not only in his inventive work,  but because of the meanness of jealous enemies, including Andy  Foger, who seemed to bear our hero a grudge of long standing. Even  though Tom had, more than once, thrashed Andy well, the bully was  always seeking a chance to play some mean trick on the young  inventor. Sometimes he succeeded, but more often the tables were  effectually turned.    It was now some time since Tom had won the prize in his electric car  and, in the meanwhile he had built himself a smaller airship, or,  rather, monoplane, named the BUTTERFLY. In it he made several  successful trips about the country, and gave exhibitions at numerous  aviation meets; once winning a valuable prize for an altitude  flight. In one trip he had met with a slight accident, and the  monoplane had only just been repaired after this when he received  the message summoning him to Philadelphia.    \"Well, Tom,\" remarked his father that afternoon, \"if you are going  to the Quaker City, to see Mr. Fenwick to-morrow, you'd better be  getting ready. Have you wired him that you will come?\"    \"No, I haven't, dad,\" was the reply. \"I'll get a message ready at  once, and when Eradicate comes back I'll have him take it to the  telegraph office.\"    \"I wouldn't do that, Tom.\"    \"Do what?\"    \"Trust it to Eradicate. He means all right, but there's no telling  when that mule of his may lie down in the road, and go to sleep.  Then your message won't get off, and Mr. Fenwick may be anxiously  waiting for it. I wouldn't like to offend him, for, though he and I  have not met in some years, yet I would be glad if you could do him  a favor. Why not take the message yourself?\"    \"Guess I will, dad. I'll run over to Mansburg in my electric car,  and send the message from there. It will go quicker, and, besides, I  want to get some piano wire to strengthen the wings of my  monoplane.\"    \"All right, Tom, and when you telegraph to Mr. Fenwick, give him my  regards, and say that I hope his airship will be a success. So it's  an electric one, eh? I wonder how it works? But you can tell me"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4230"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle; Or, Fun and Adventures on the Road (#2)"],[1,"used to say he would never amount to anything, that inventors never  did, but Mr. Swift proved them all wrong by amassing a considerable  fortune out of his many patents. He grew up, married and had one  son, Tom. Mrs. Barton died when Tom was three years old, and since  then he had lived with his father and a succession of nurses and  housekeepers. The last woman to have charge of the household was a  Mrs. Baggert, a motherly widow, and she succeeded so well, and Tom  and his father formed such an attachment for her, that she was  regarded as a fixture, and had now been in charge ten years.    Mr. Swift and his son lived in a handsome house on the outskirts of  the village of Shopton, in New York State. The village was near a  large body of water, which I shall call Lake Carlopa, and there Tom  and his father used to spend many pleasant days boating, for Tom and  the inventor were better chums than many boys are, and they were  often seen together in a craft rowing about, or fishing. Of course  Tom had some boy friends, but he went with his father more often  than he did with them.    Though many of Mr. Swift's inventions paid him well, he was  constantly seeking to perfect others. To this end he had built near  his home several machine shops, with engines, lathes and apparatus  for various kinds of work. Tom, too, had the inventive fever in his  veins, and had planned some useful implements and small machines.    Along the pleasant country roads on a fine day in April rode Tom  Swift on his way to Mansburg to register the letter. As he descended  a little hill he saw, some distance away, but coming toward him, a  great cloud of dust.    \"Somebody must be driving a herd of cattle along the road,\" thought  Tom. \"I hope they don't get in my way, or, rather, I hope I don't  get in theirs. Guess I'd better keep to one side, yet there isn't  any too much room.\"    The dust-cloud came nearer. It was so dense that whoever or whatever  was making it could not be distinguished.    \"Must be a lot of cattle in that bunch,\" mused the young inventor,  \"but I shouldn't think they'd trot them so on a warm day like this.  Maybe they're stampeded. If they are I've got to look out.\" This  idea caused him some alarm.    He tried to peer through the dust-cloud, but could not. Nearer and  nearer it came. Tom kept on, taking care to get as far to the side  of the road as he could. Then from the midst of the enveloping mass  came the sound of a steady \"chug-chug.\"    \"It's a motor-cycle!\" exclaimed Tom. \"He must have his muffler wide  open, and that's kicking up as much dust as the wheels do. Whew! But  whoever's on it will look like a clay image at the end of the line!\"    Now that he knew it was a fellow-cyclist who was raising such a  disturbance, Tom turned more toward the middle of the road. As yet  he had not had a sight of the rider, but the explosions of the motor  were louder. Suddenly, when the first advancing particles of dust  reached him, almost making him sneeze, Tom caught sight of the  rider. He was a man of middle age, and he was clinging to the  handle-bars of the machine. The motor was going at full speed.    Tom quickly turned to one side, to avoid the worst of the dust. The  motor-cyclist glanced at the youth, but this act nearly proved  disastrous for him. He took his eyes from the road ahead for just a  moment, and he did not see a large stone directly in his path. His  front wheel hit it, and the heavy machine, which he could not  control very well, skidded over toward the lad on the bicycle. The  motor-cyclist bounced up in the air from the saddle, and nearly lost  his hold on the handle-bars.    \"Look out!\" cried Tom. \"You'll smash into me!\"    \"I'm--I'm--try--ing--not--to!\" were the words that were rattled out  of the middle-aged man.    Tom gave his wheel a desperate twist to get out of the way. The  motor-cyclist tried to do the same, but the machine he was on  appeared to want matters its own way. He came straight for Tom, and  a disastrous collision might have resulted had not another stone  been in the way. The front wheel hit this, and was swerved to one  side. The motor-cycle flashed past Tom, just grazing his wheel, and  then was lost to sight beyond in a cloud of dust that seemed to  follow it like a halo.    \"Why don't you learn to ride before you come out on the road!\" cried  Tom somewhat angrily.    Like an echo from the dust-cloud came floating back these words:    \"I'm--try--ing--to!\" Then the sound of the explosions became  fainter.    \"Well, he's got lots to learn yet!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That's twice  to-day I've nearly been run down. I expect I'd better look out for the  third time. They say that's always fatal,\" and the lad leaped from his  wheel. \"Wonder if he bent any of my spokes?\" the young inventor  continued as he inspected his bicycle.          CHAPTER II.    TOM OVERHEARS SOMETHING      \"Everything seems to be all right,\" Tom remarked, \"but another inch  or so and he'd have crashed into me. I wonder who he was? I wish I  had a machine like that. I could make better time than I can on my  bicycle. Perhaps I'll get one some day. Well, I might as well ride  on.\"    Tom was soon at Mansburg, and going to the post-office handed in the  letter for registry. Bearing in mind his father's words, he looked  about to see if there were any suspicious characters, but the only  person he noticed was a well-dressed man, with a black mustache, who  seemed to be intently studying the schedule of the arrival and  departure of the mails.    \"Do you want the receipt for the registered letter sent to you here  or at Shopton?\" asked the clerk of Tom. \"Come to think of it,  though, it will have to come here, and you can call for it. I'll  have it returned to Mr. Barton Swift, care of general delivery, and  you can get it the next time you are over,\" for the clerk knew Tom.    \"That will do,\" answered our hero, and as he turned away from the  window he saw that the man who had been inquiring about the mails  was regarding him curiously. Tom thought nothing of it at the time,  but there came an occasion when he wished that he had taken more  careful note of the well-dressed individual. As the youth passed out  of the outer door he saw the man walk over to the registry window.    \"He seems to have considerable mail business,\" thought Tom, and then  the matter passed from his mind as he mounted his wheel and hurried  to the machine shop.    \"Say, I'm awfully sorry,\" announced Mr. Merton when Tom said he had  come for the bolts, \"but they're not quite done. They need  polishing. I know I promised them to your father to-day, and he can  have them, but he was very particular about the polish, and as one  of my best workers was taken sick, I'm a little behind.\"    \"How long will it take to polish them?\" asked Tom.    \"Oh, about an hour. In fact, a man is working on them now. If you  could call this afternoon they'll be ready. Can you?\"    \"I s'pose I've got to,\" replied Tom good-naturedly. \"Guess I'll have  to stay in Mansburg for dinner. I can't get back to Shopton in time  now.\"    \"I'll be sure to have them for you after dinner,\" promised Mr.  Merton. \"Now, there's a matter I want to speak to you about, Tom.  Has your father any idea of giving the work he has been turning over  to me to some other firm?\"    \"Not that I know of. Why?\" and the lad showed his wonder.    \"Well, I'll tell you why. Some time ago there was a stranger in  here, asking about your father's work. I told Mr. Swift of it at the  time. The stranger said then that he and some others were thinking  of opening a machine shop, and he wanted to find out whether they  would be likely to get any jobs from your father. I told the man I  knew nothing about Mr. Swift's business, and he went away. I didn't  hear any more of it, though of course I didn't want to lose your  father's trade. Now a funny thing happened. Only this morning the  same man was back here, and he was making particular inquiries about  your father's private machine shops.\"    \"He was?\" exclaimed Tom excitedly.    \"Yes. He wanted to know where they were located, how they were laid  out, and what sort of work he did in them.\"    \"What did you tell him?\"    \"Nothing at all. I suspected something, and I said the best way for  him to find out would be to go and see your father. Wasn't that  right?\"    \"Sure. Dad doesn't want his business known any more than he can  help. What do you suppose they wanted?\"    \"Well, the man talked as though he and his partners would like to  buy your father's shops.\"    \"I don't believe he'd sell. He has them arranged just for his own  use in making patents, and I'm sure he would not dispose of them.\"    \"Well, that's what I thought, but I didn't tell the man so. I judged  it would be best for him to find out for himself.\"    \"What was the man's name?\"    \"He didn't tell me, and I didn't ask him.\"    \"How did he look?\"    \"Well, he was well dressed, wore kid gloves and all that, and he had  a little black mustache.\"    Tom started, and Mr. Merton noticed it.    \"Do you know him?\" he asked.    \"No,\" replied Tom, \"but I saw--\" Then he stopped. He recalled the  man he had seen in the post-office. He answered this description,  but it was too vague to be certain.    \"Did you say you'd seen him?\" asked Mr. Merton, regarding Tom  curiously.    \"No--yes--that is--well, I'll tell my father about it,\" stammered  Tom, who concluded that it would be best to say nothing of his  suspicions. \"I'll be back right after dinner, Mr. Merton. Please  have the bolts ready for me, if you can.\"    \"I will. Is your father going to use them in a new machine?\"    \"Yes; dad is always making new machines,\" answered the youth, as the  most polite way of not giving the proprietor of the shop any  information. \"I'll be back right after dinner,\" he called as he went  out to get on his wheel.    Tom was much puzzled. He felt certain that the man in the post-office  and the one "]]]
