Although some zoologists have recently revived the old belief that the  sponges and the coelenterates are closely allied, no one in recent times  has suggested that there is any morphological relationship between  either of these groups and the polyzoa. Personally I do not think that  any one of the three groups is allied to any other so far as anatomy is  concerned; but for biological reasons it is convenient to describe the  freshwater representatives of the three groups in one volume of the  \"Fauna.\"    Indeed, I originally proposed to the Editor that this volume should  include an account not only of the freshwater species, but of all those  that have been found in stagnant water of any kind. It is often  difficult to draw a line between the fauna of brackish ponds and marshes  and that of pure fresh water or that of the sea, and this is  particularly the case as regards the estuarine tracts of India and  Burma.    Pelseneer[A] has expressed the opinion that the Black Sea and the  South-east of Asia are the two districts in the world most favourable  for the study of the origin of a freshwater fauna from a marine one. The  transition in particular from the Bay of Bengal, which is much less salt  than most seas, to the lower reaches of the Ganges or the Brahmaputra is  peculiarly easy, and we find many molluscs and other animals of marine  origin in the waters of these rivers far above tidal influence.  Conditions are unfavourable in the rivers themselves for the development  and multiplication of organisms of many groups, chiefly because of the  enormous amount of silt held in suspension in the water and constantly  being deposited on the bottom, and a much richer fauna exists in ponds  and lakes in the neighbourhood of the rivers and estuaries than in  running water. I have only found three species of polyzoa and three of  sponges in running water in India, and of these six species, five have  also been found in ponds or lakes. I have, on the other hand, found  three coelenterates in an estuary, and all three species are essentially  marine forms, but two have established themselves in ponds of brackish  water, one (the sea-anemone _Sagartia schilleriana_) undergoing in so  doing modifications of a very peculiar and interesting nature. It is not  uncommon for animals that have established themselves in pools of  brackish water to be found occasionally in ponds of fresh water; but I  have not been able to discover a single instance of an estuarine species  that is found in the latter and not in the former.         [Footnote A: \"L'origine des animaux d'eau douce,\" Bull. de       l'Acad. roy. de Belgique (Classe des Sciences), No. 12,       1905, p. 724.]    For these reasons I intended, as I have said, to include in this volume  descriptions of all the coelenterates and polyzoa known to occur in  pools of brackish water in the estuary of the Ganges and elsewhere in  India, but as my manuscript grew I began to realize that this would be  impossible without including also an amount of general introductory  matter not justified either by the scope of the volume or by special  knowledge on the part of its author. I have, however, given in the  introduction to each part a list of the species found in stagnant  brackish water with a few notes and references to descriptions.      BIOLOGICAL PECULIARITIES OF THE SPONGES, COELENTERATES, AND POLYZOA OF  FRESH WATER.    There is often an external resemblance between the representatives of  the sponges, coelenterates, and polyzoa that causes them to be classed  together in popular phraseology as \"zoophytes\"; and this resemblance is  not merely a superficial one, for it is based on a similarity in habits  as well as of habitat, and is correlated with biological phenomena that  lie deeper than what are ordinarily called habits. These phenomena are  of peculiar interest with regard to difficult questions of nutrition and  reproduction that perhaps can only be solved by a close study of animals  living together in identical conditions and exhibiting, apparently in  consequence of so living, similar but by no means identical tendencies,  either anatomical or physiological, in certain directions.    One of the most important problems on which the study of the sponges,  coelenterates, and polyzoa of stagnant water throws light is that of the  production of resting buds and similar reproductive bodies adapted to  withstand unfavourable conditions in a quiescent state and to respond to  the renewal of favourable conditions by a renewed growth and activity.    Every autumn, in an English pond or lake, a crisis takes place in the  affairs of the less highly organized inhabitants, and preparations are  made to withstand the unfavourable conditions due directly or indirectly  to the low winter temperature of the water: the individual must perish  but the race may be preserved. At this season _Hydra_, which has been  reproducing its kind by means of buds throughout the summer, develops  eggs with a hard shell that will lie dormant in the mud until next  spring; the phylactolaematous polyzoa produce statoblasts, the  ctenostomatous polyzoa resting-buds (\"hibernacula\"), and the sponges  gemmules. Statoblasts, hibernacula, and gemmules are alike produced  asexually, but they resemble the eggs of _Hydra_ in being provided with  a hard, resistant shell, and in having the capacity to lie dormant until  favourable conditions return.    In an Indian pond or lake a similar crisis takes place in the case of  most species, but it does not take place at the same time of year in the  case of all species. Unfortunately the phenomena of periodic  physiological change have been little studied in the freshwater fauna of  most parts of the country, and as yet we know very little indeed of the  biology of the Himalayan lakes and tarns, the conditions in which  resemble those to be found in similar masses of water in Europe much  more closely than they do those that occur in ponds and lakes in a  tropical plain. In Bengal, however, I have been able to devote  considerable attention to the subject, and can state definitely that  some species flourish chiefly in winter and enter the quiescent stage at  the beginning of the hot weather (that is to say about March), while  others reach their maximum development during the \"rains\" (July to  September) and as a rule die down during winter, which is the driest as  well as the coolest time of year.    The following is a list of the forms that in Bengal are definitely known  to produce hard-shelled eggs, gemmules, resting-buds, or statoblasts  only or most profusely at the approach of the hot weather and to  flourish during winter:--         _Spongilla carteri._       _Sponging alba._       _Spongilla alba_ var. _bengalensis_.       _Spongilla crassissima._       _Hydra vulgaris._       _Victorella bengalensis._       _Plumatella fruticosa._       _Plumatella emarginata._       _Plumatella javanica._    The following forms flourish mainly during the \"rains\":--         _Spongilla lacustris_ subsp. _reticulata_.       _Trochospongilla latouchiana._       _Trochospongilla phillottiana._       _Stolella indica._    The following flourish throughout the year:--         _Spongilla proliferens._       _Hislopia lacustris._    It is particularly interesting to note that three of the species that  flourish in the mild winter of Bengal, namely _Hydra vulgaris_,  _Plumatella emarginata_, and _P. fruticosa_, are identical with species  that in Europe perish in winter. There is evidence, moreover, that the  statoblasts of the genus to which two of them belong burst more readily,  and thus give rise to new colonies, after being subjected to a  considerable amount of cold. In Bengal they only burst after being  subjected to the heat of the hot weather. Does extreme heat have a  similar effect on aquatic organisms as extreme cold? There is some  evidence that it has.    The species that flourish in India during the rains are all forms which  habitually live near the surface or the edge of ponds or puddles, and  are therefore liable to undergo desiccation as soon as the rains cease  and the cold weather supervenes.

Unlike every other  manufacturing district I have ever visited, they retain unimpaired all  their rural and primitive virtues. Clean to a proverb, in their houses and  persons, hospitable and amiable in their manners, simple in their habits,  cheerful and devoted in their religion, they form perhaps, the happiest  community in the world. In passing through the country, a stranger would  never find out that he was in a manufacturing district, but might fancy  himself in the green valleys of a partly pastoral, partly agricultural  people. Thickly inhabited, the beautiful little cottages, clustered into  villages, or scattered along the glens, or sides of the hills, are  embowered with fruit trees, and encircled with shrubs and flowers, which  each cottager cultivates with a zeal peculiar to his race; on every side  rich fields of grain or pasture stretch out like a vast enamelled carpet  between the hills, which are clothed in dense forest of spruce, fir, pine,  and beech, filled with deer, roe, and capercalzie; they extend in every  direction, far beyond the reach of the eye, one vast cloud of verdure. The  fabriques or factories, are placed generally in the middle of one of these  villages, the extent of which can only be known by going from house to  house; so closely is each hid in its own fruit-bower, and so surrounded by  shrubs and flowers, that the eye can only pick up the buildings by their  blue smoke, or get a glimpse of them here and there as you advance; thus  some of the villages are elongated to three miles, forming the most  delicious walk along its grassy road, generally accompanied by a stream,  _always_ overhung by a profusion of wild flowers, the mountain-ash, and  weeping birch; many of the former only to be found in our gardens. It has a  very picturesque effect to see the inhabitants of these villages with their  simple costume; and if it rains, their umbrellas, often of rich colors like  their glass, scarlet, green, and deep crimson, with beautiful ruby,  emerald, or turquoise handles; not such as a stranger might suppose a gaudy  glass bauble, but rich and massive, and having all the appearance of the  solid, gold, and gem-studded handles of the oriental weapons.    The fabrique is built like the rest of the cottages, and only differs from  them in size, and the shape and height of its chimney, which emitting only  wood smoke, has none of the dense sulphuric cloud which blackens and  poisons the neighborhood of coal-fed factories: it is never that  ostentatious building for whose magnitude and embellishments the public are  obliged to pay, in the increased charges on its productions. The glass  fabriques of Bohemia are all small, in fact only one large apartment, in  the centre of which is the furnace, a circular structure divided into eight  compartments containing the melted metal for as many colors; one man and a  boy are stationed at the door of each compartment, the former to extract  the fluid with his pipe, the latter to hold the wooden mould[1] in which  the article is blown and shaped. The number of hands employed in an  ordinary fabrique, are:--Eight men who work in the metal, take it from the  fire, and blow it in the moulds; eight helps to hold the moulds, &c.; four  to stir the metal, &c.; two breakers; four day laborers.    The best men are sometimes paid from eighteen to twenty shillings a week,  and provide their own food, which is good; and as they require much  nourishment from the exhausting effects of the heat, it consists of meat,  vegetables, and a vast quantity of beer; those who are employed about the  furnace especially, drink from twelve to fifteen quarts a day; it is a  clear, bitter beverage, which they, in common with all the German race,  like beyond every thing else, but it is of little strength; intoxication is  almost unknown, and as a proof of their careful and excellent character, in  one of the above-mentioned villages, three miles in length, a fire had not  been known in the memory of the oldest inhabitants I questioned, though the  houses from the ground to the roof are made entirely of wood.    The materials of which the glass is composed, as far as can be ascertained,  and they seem to make no secret of it, appear to be the same as those in  use in England; they say, they derive their perfection from their mode of  mixing and burning the material. Thus the principal component parts  are:--Sand; chalk; potash; brimstone; arsenic, mixed with various colors,  regulated by the principal:--Uran oxide; cobalt oxide; coppre oxide; nickel  oxide; chrom oxide; minium; tin oxide.    The gold used in ornamenting the glass is from the purest ducats, dissolved  in strong acid (artz wasser), the oil with which the colors are mixed is of  turpentine (harz oehl).    Nothing is done in most of the blowing fabriques but mixing the material,  and coloring; and for cutting, polishing, &c., from three to six wheels are  used--all the finishing goes on in the little cottages by which the furnace  is surrounded, and with which the valleys and sides of the hills are  studded; here you find, within the contracted chambers of these small  block-houses, if on the ground-flat, standing on an earthen[2] floor like  our Highland cottages, an artist of the first ability, tracing the  exquisite scrolls and flowers which we see in these beautiful works of art;  and which are performed by men bearing all the appearance of simple  cotters; but whose hand sweeps free and careless over the glass with the  confidence and ease of an experienced artist; seldom being provided with  more than two very ordinary looking brushes, a small one and another a size  larger, and working frequently without any pattern, or indicating lines  upon the glass they are painting; but perfect from habitude, the scrolls,  and wreaths, and flowers, come out with the same facility as one traces a  name upon the dewy pane of a window. Often the whole family are brought up  from childhood in painting and in drawing on glass, and thus producing a  race of hereditary artists; boys from thirteen and upwards are employed in  the most delicate works in this genre of art. Each cottage where the  painting and gilding go on, is provided with a small oven, into which the  glass is put to bake in the colors, where it is kept for a day and allowed  to cool down; the white figures and flowers, when they go into the oven,  are of a dark chrome color, but come out pure white, as will be observed on  examining any glass on which flowers of this color are painted; the gold,  also, when laid on, is of a dead brown, and when burnt in, is polished,  generally by women of the family. The gold in many instances is left  unpolished, and only the stalks and fibres are burnished, which give an  excellent effect. It is most interesting to go from one cottage to another;  in one you are amazed by the exquisite paintings in gold, silver, and  colors; in another, the cutting out all those beautiful leaf-work, lily,  bell-flower, octagon, and star-shaped vases, which is done, not only by  men, but by their children, girls and boys. In one cottage, I was  particularly struck by a man, his two daughters, and son, sitting at as  many wheels, cutting the most elaborate, but delicate, figures; shaping  from the merely turned over bell vases, those beautiful varieties of lily  and flower-indented lamps for suspension, and vessels for holding bouquets,  tracing the scrolls, stalks, and fibres, with the same ease as the  bare-footed wife and mother prepared their supper in the wooden bowl on the  earth-floor behind them; for there was but one apartment for the fine arts,  the nursery, and the kitchen, yet all was neatness, perfect cleanliness,  and order; while on the long beam which formed the sill of the three  mullion windows, was arranged a number of glass objects in the glorious  colors of Bohemian art--ruby, emerald, topaz, chrysopras, turquoise; with  pure crystals, which, richly cut, reflected, like a rainbow, the gems by  which they are surrounded. In another cottage, in Steinchoenau, I was much  pleased with the designs which two young men were painting, both in gold,  and colors; of which the former were scrolls of a very superior character,  and the latter, flowers, butterflies, and insects. I questioned one of the  men respecting the forms and characteristics of those he was painting, and  which were beautiful illustrations of Natural History; when he brought me  in, from a little bed-room, or rather closet, two boxes full of exquisitely  preserved specimens of a great variety of native insects, which he had  collected in his leisure hours, and arranged himself, to assist him in his  painting. The copies were facsimiles of the originals, both as to colors  and character. Among these insects I observed a beautiful miniature  crawfish, not so large as a shrimp, a native, also, of the streams in his  neighborhood. So identified had these productions of nature become with his  imagination, that he was, at the moment I came in, painting some most  correctly, without any specimen before him. It is impossible to express the  feelings produced by these people, so simple, so industrious, and, above  all, _so_ modest. They could not refrain from surprise at the admiration  their every-day productions created in us; and these simple artisans would  with difficulty believe that their works were sought for, and thus valued,  in all powerful and wealthy England, where they believe nothing is unknown,  nothing imperfect, nothing impossible! One man whom I visited is an  extraordinary genius, rarely to be met with; he has been driven by the  force of that same genius, to seek abroad, in France and Bavaria (Munich),  food for his mind, and has brought back with him several folio works of  engravings from the best masters, from which he designs. Placing before him  one of these works, a Raphael or a Rubens, he either copies the group, or"]]]
