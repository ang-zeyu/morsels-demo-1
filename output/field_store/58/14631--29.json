somewhat dangerous harbour of Mombasa, on the  east coast of Africa. The town lies on an island of the same name,  separated from the mainland only by a very narrow channel, which forms  the harbour; and as our vessel steamed slowly in, close under the  quaint old Portuguese fortress built over three hundred years ago, I  was much struck with the strange beauty of the view which gradually  opened out before me. Contrary to my anticipation, everything looked  fresh and green, and an oriental glamour of enchantment seemed to hang  over the island. The old town was bathed in brilliant sunshine and  reflected itself lazily on the motionless sea; its flat roofs and  dazzlingly white walls peeped out dreamily between waving palms and  lofty cocoanuts, huge baobabs and spreading mango trees; and the darker  background of well-wooded hills and slopes on the mainland formed a  very effective setting to a beautiful and, to me, unexpected picture.    The harbour was plentifully sprinkled with Arab dhows, in some of  which, I believe, even at the present day, a few slaves are  occasionally smuggled off to Persia and Arabia. It has always been a  matter of great wonder to me how the navigators of little vessels find  their way from port to port, as they do, without the aid of either  compass or sextant, and how they manage to weather the terrible storms  that at certain seasons of the year suddenly visit eastern seas. I  remember once coming across a dhow becalmed in the middle of the Indian  Ocean, and its crew making signals of distress, our captain slowed down  to investigate. There were four men on board, all nearly dead from  thirst; they had been without drink of any kind for several days and  had completely lost their bearings. After giving them some casks of  water, we directed them to Muscat (the port they wished to make), and  our vessel resumed its journey, leaving them still becalmed in the  midst of that glassy sea. Whether they managed to reach their  destination I never knew.    As our steamer made its way to its anchorage, the romantic surroundings  of the harbour of Mombasa conjured up, visions of stirring adventures  of the past, and recalled to my mind the many tales of reckless doings  of pirates and slavers, which as a boy it had been my delight to read.  I remembered that it was at this very place that in 1498 the great  Vasco da Gama nearly lost his ship and life through the treachery of  his Arab pilot, who plotted to wreck the vessel on the reef which bars  more than half the entrance to the harbour. Luckily, this nefarious  design was discovered in time, and the bold navigator promptly hanged  the pilot, and would also have sacked the town but for the timely  submission and apologies of the Sultan.
