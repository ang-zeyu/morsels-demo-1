One of these is illustrated in Fig. 4. An ingenious  boy with a block of wood for a base, some stout wire and corks, can make  one almost as useful, though not so handsome.      [Illustration: FIG. 6.]    A more elaborate form is shown in Fig. 5. It has a glass stage to hold  transparent objects, and a brass one for opaque objects, and a mirror  below to reflect light up through transparent objects.    It is much better to use a good simple microscope than a poor and cheap  compound one; be sure and remember this and not be enticed to buy such  an one by any representations as to its great magnifying power.    A compound microscope is one with a tube from four to ten inches long,  an arrangement for holding the object to be looked at, and a mirror  below to reflect light upon or through it. The lenses at the end next  the object are small, and are set in a small brass tube, which is called  an \"objective.\" It screws into the large tube. The lenses at the end of  the large tube next the eye are set in a tube, called the eye-piece,  which slides in and out of the large tube. Different objectives contain  lenses of different sizes according to the magnifying power desired, and  they are named \"two inch,\" \"one inch,\" \"half inch,\" and so on down to  \"one seventy-fifth.\" Eye-pieces are sometimes named \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" but  more properly \"two inch,\" and so on down to \"one eighth.\" There is a  very great variety in the forms of compound microscopes, from the very  simple up to the very elaborate, and the prices vary accordingly. A  simple but useful form is given in Fig. 6.    A great deal of money can be expended on a microscope and the various  instruments made to use with it and which are called \"accessory  apparatus\"; but it is best not to buy these instruments until you know  just what you want, and not to spend much money at first except under  the advice of a \"microscopist.\"    Some simple things, however, you will need at once, such as a few slips  of glass three inches long and one inch wide, called \"glass slides,\"  some pieces of very thin glass, called \"cover glass,\" a pair of  tweezers, some needles fastened into pen-holders for handles, and a few  glass tubes commonly called \"pipettes,\" or \"dipping tubes.\" These can be  readily bought, and some of them easily made.      [Illustration: CATCHING ANIMALCULA WITH A PIPETTE.]      III.--OBJECTS.    As soon as you have a microscope you will begin to look at everything  and anything: dust, crumbs of bread, flour, starch, mosquitoes, flies,  and moth millers in their season; flowers and leaves, cotton, wool, and  silk. But this scattering kind of observation will soon weary you. In  order to get the greatest pleasure and best results from your work, you  must proceed with some system.      [Illustration: BULL'S EYE LENS.]    There are so many objects visible only through the microscope that life  is not long enough for you to see them all, much less to study them.  Some microscopists devote the time they have for such studies to the  observation of single classes of objects; the physician observes the  various parts of the animal structure, and calls his work \"histology;\"  the botanist examines the vegetable kingdom; the entomologist, insects;  but in all these departments there are numerous subdivisions. As a guide  to your work, you will find some book on the microscope very useful; the  best one is _The Microscope and its Revelations_, by Dr. William B.  Carpenter.      [Illustration: MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]      [Illustration: FLY'S EYE--5 DIAMETERS.]    Objects through which you can see light are called \"transparent,\" and  are the easiest to look at with the microscope, because you can lay them  on a glass slide and throw light up through them with your mirror. Thick  objects through which light cannot pass are called \"opaque,\" and are  more difficult to examine, and can only be seen with low powers and a  bright light.    In order to see such objects in the evening, you will need a \"bull's  eye\" lens mounted on a stand, which you can place beside your microscope  and between the lamp and the stage, condensing the light of the lamp on  the object. (_Fig. 1._) There are other methods of illuminating opaque  objects, but they are expensive and difficult to manage, yet by and by  if you persevere in this delightful occupation you will learn what they  are.      [Illustration: Scale of Butterfly    MAGNIFIED 200 DIAMETERS.]      [Illustration: HEAD OF MOSQUITO. MAGNIFIED 15 DIAMETERS.]    Some persons will expect you to show them a fly as big as a horse; but  you will soon be able to prove to them that you know more about the  matter than they do. With a large hand-lens, you can see a whole fly at  once and magnify it two or three times; but when you put it on the stage  of your compound microscope and try to magnify it still more, you will  find that you can only see a part of it at a time, and the higher the  power you use, the less can you see; in other words, the more you  magnify an object, the smaller is the field of view.    An inch-objective will show the head of an housefly, which in a bright  light is a very beautiful object. No picture can equal the delicacy of  the color of the eyes of a live fly.      [Illustration: SECTION OF WOOD.    MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]    After a little practise you will be able to separate the different parts  of insects and look at them with higher powers. The moth fly will soon  be on the wing, and your aunt will not call you cruel if you kill and  cut up large numbers of them. Put a little of the dust that comes off  from the wing of a moth on a glass slide, look at it with a high power,  and you will find that each particle of dust is a pretty leaf-like  scale. You have seen in summer the dust on the wings of butterflies;  remember this, and look at this butterfly dust with your microscope.    Flowers and leaves you can always easily obtain; but in looking at them  you must remember what has already been said about \"transparent\" and  \"opaque\" objects.    Thin slices or sections of stems, leaves, and portions of flowers, can  be made with a sharp knife, and examined as transparent objects, so that  thus you can observe the internal or cellular structure of the vegetable  kingdom.      IV.--HOME EXPERIMENTS.      [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    During the cold weather it is not pleasant to make excursions into the  country and search for objects for the microscope; so you will look  about and see what you can find at home; and if you live in Boston,  Cochituate water will invite your inspection. The best way to get at the  minute objects in this or any water that is supplied through pipes, is  to make a bag of cotton cloth, not too fine, well washed in water  without soap, about a foot long, large enough at the top to slip over a  faucet that has a screw on it (like the common kitchen faucet adapted  for a filter), so that it can be tied with a string, and small enough at  the bottom to be tied on to the neck of a small bottle such as is used  for homoeopathic pills. This bag should taper gradually in size from  the top to the bottom. (_Fig. 1._)      [Illustration: The Water Flea    FIG. 2. CYCLOPS QUADRICORNIS. MAGNIFIED 20 DIAMETERS.]      [Illustration: FIG. 3. CANTHOCAMPTUS MINUTUS. 40 DIAMETERS.]    If there is a strong head of water where your faucet is, you must reduce  the pressure by opening other faucets on the same floor, such as those  in the laundry, otherwise many of the small creatures will be crushed in  the interstices of the bag. Now let the water run. The bag will swell  out and the water ooze through its sides, and all objects too small to  pass through it will fall down and settle in the little bottle at the  bottom. When you see that there is a considerable amount of sediment in  the bottle, shut off the water and gently squeeze the bag between your  thumb and forefinger, beginning at the top and moving your hand down  towards the bottle. This movement will cause much of the sediment that  has adhered to the sides of the bag to fall down. Now untie your bottle  and set it aside and let the water run through the bag to clean it. If  you have a filter attached to your kitchen faucet you can get a very  good idea of the solid contents of the water by unscrewing it, or  turning it over if it is made so as to reverse, and letting the sediment  that has collected on it drip into a tumbler, but the bag gives much  better results, as many of the delicate forms that live in the water are  crushed to death on the filter.      [Illustration: FIG. 4. CHYDORUS SPHOERICUS. 50 DIAMETERS.]    Having got the sediment in either a tumbler or a bottle, you must make  your first observation on it with the naked eye by holding it up to the  light and looking through it. You will find it of a brown color, because  a large part of it consists of particles of earth and decayed vegetable  matter, but you will presently see many little white specks moving about  with a jumping or hopping movement. These are commonly called  \"water-fleas,\" on account of their peculiar movements, but the name is  misleading, as they belong to the crustacea (animals having a shell or  crust like the lobster), and not to the insects.    They are found abundantly in ponds and ditches, and in salt water.  Sometimes they are so abundant in drinking water that has not been  filtered, as to alarm a timid person, but you will find them just as  good to eat raw as they are cooked. The most common of these little  creatures is the _Cyclops Quadricornis_, so called because he has one  eye and four horns. (_Fig. 2._)    This picture represents a female, and she carries her eggs in the two  little black bags that you see fastened on each side of the abdomen. You  will find it very interesting by and by to watch the eggs hatch and see"]]]
