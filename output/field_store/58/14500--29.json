The  price of gram varies very greatly, according to the locality and season,  and is a subject of much speculation and gambling amongst the native  community. I have known it as high as 7 seers (14 lbs. weight), and as low  as a maund (80 lbs. weight), per rupee. It also varies greatly in  quality, depending on the locality in which it is grown and the conditions  under which it has been harvested, and is by native grain-sellers known as  first and second class gram. Good gram, when a small quantity is taken up  and examined in the palm of the hand, should be free from sand, dirt,  small pieces of stick, straws, or other sorts of seeds; in fact, it  should, what is known in the trade, \"run clean.\" Each individual grain  should be round and plump, as if the husk was well filled. It should not  be shrivelled up and wrinkled, and be free from worm or weevil marks,  which can be told by there being a small round hole in it, and the grain,  when cracked, being found hollowed out and eaten away. Generally the  weevil (kirim) will be found in the cavity, but if not, it will be full of  a fine powder. Weevil-eaten gram cannot be mistaken, and denotes that the  grain is old, and has been badly stored. In most samples of gram, unless  quite new, a small proportion of worm-eaten grains will be found, and this  is not of any consequence; but if there are a large number, there will be  a larger proportion of husk (which has no nourishing properties) than  grain, and a larger quantity will have to be given. When a grain of gram  is crushed between the teeth it should impart the taste of a dry pea in  the mouth, and be devoid of all mustiness, which is present if it has got  wet or mouldy, as it is very apt to do. In new gram the husk at the point  is of a slightly greenish shade, that disappears with keeping. It is  generally supposed that new gram is not so good as when it is a few months  old; but myself, I have never seen any ill effects from its use. The only  thing to be careful about is that it is perfectly ripe, for natives have a  great trick of cutting and plucking every grain, fruit, and vegetable  before they have arrived at full maturity. Gram should be crushed or  bruised, not _ground_, so as to break the outer husk and allow the juices  of the stomach to act on the kernel. It should be crushed or bruised only,  as if ground into a fine powder a good deal goes to waste. It is  sufficient if each seed is so crushed that it is split in two. Gram,  wheat, and all other grains in the East are ground by the women of the  family between two stones, one of which revolves on the top of the other  by means of a wooden handle fixed in it. To crush gram the stones require  to be sharper set than if they are to grind any other grain into flour.  Gram can be got ready crushed from the corn-dealer (baniah) at a small  increased charge per maund (80 lbs.), or what I generally do is to pay my  head groom (syce) the regular bazaar rate (nirrick), and get the women of  his family to crush it, they providing their own mill (chuckie). The only  disadvantage of this plan is that it is necessary to weigh the grain a  second time after it has been crushed, otherwise it will be short, as  natives eat it themselves. But I found in the long run the syces would not  steal it; natives are sharp enough to see when any profit can be made, and  it was not to their advantage to give back short weight. Excellent  gram-crushing machines, working with fluted rollers, are sold by several  firms in India, and are adjustable so as to take any grain. They are made  to fit into a box for travelling, which, when in use, forms a stand for  the crusher to work on. They are, however, somewhat expensive, and  although admirable for a large stud of horses, are hardly required for a  private stable. If, however, expense is no object, they are certainly  preferable to the native mill, as they are cleaner, bits of grit not  coming off the stone, and each individual grain being crushed, which even  the best native mills will not do. Crushed grain is much quicker digested  than whole, particularly by old horses whose teeth are not in good order,  and who cannot masticate their food properly. It is a common mistake to  give too much gram or other grain, there being a prevailing idea that the  more that is given the more work the horse will do. There is no greater  error; it is like putting more coal into the furnace of an engine that can  only consume a certain amount; the extra quantity only goes to waste, and  upsets the digestive functions of the stomach. What is required is a  judicious admixture of food given at a proper time; not a large quantity  improperly given of an improper quality. Gram should be given in the  proportion of one part of bran to two of gram; or what is better, one part  each of bran (choker), gram, and parched barley (adarwah), or oats (jai),  by weight. These can be purchased separately from the corn-dealer and  mixed together, and thus cannot be eaten by any of the servants, like pure  gram can be. If the horse is not digesting his food properly, whole grains  will be found in his droppings that have passed through the bowels  unaltered. There will be always a few of these found, especially if the  horse is getting parched barley or oats, as the husks of both these grains  are very indigestible. If the horse begins to get thin, and fall away in  condition as well, it is then time to take some measures to remedy  matters, otherwise no notice need be taken.      Barley (_jow_).    In many parts of Northern India, especially on the Afghan frontier, whole,  uncrushed barley is used. It does not seem to hurt country-breds, but with  old animals that are not used to it, and particularly Australians, the  practice is dangerous. During the Afghan War, on one occasion there being  no other grain available, whole barley was supplied to the horses of the  battery of artillery to which I then belonged. A number of them were  attacked with colic, and several died from the irritation caused by the  pointed awns or ends of the beards to the bowels. No doubt horses, and  particularly young ones, will get used to feeding on most grains if the  change is brought about gradually, but a sudden change from any one to  another is dangerous. At the best, whole barley is not an economical food.  The husk resists the digestive action of the stomach and intestines, and a  quantity is always passed out of the body whole. Barley ought certainly  always to be crushed, or, better still, parched, and turned into  \"adarwah.\" This is done by professional grain parchers in the bazaar; but  sometimes, though rarely, some of the women of the servants' families can  do it. It consists of half filling a wide shallow iron pan with sand, and  placing it over a fire till nearly red hot. A couple of handfuls of the  grain is then thrown into the sand with a peculiar turn of the wrist which  scatters it over the hot surface, about which it is stirred for a few  seconds with an iron spoon or small shovel pierced with holes like a  fish-ladle. The grain is partially baked, swells up and becomes brittle,  the husk cracking, when it is scraped up and lifted out with the ladle,  the sand being riddled through back into the pan. A good parcher will turn  out a \"maund\" (80 lbs.) in a wonderfully short space of time, the whole  process being gone through with a dexterity only acquired by long  practice. In India barley usually runs very light, there being a great  deal of husk. Boiled barley is a most useful diet for a sick horse. It  requires well boiling for at least half an hour, and the water then  drained off. I have known horses drink this barley-water when they won't  look at anything else.      Bran (_choker_).    In most of the large stations in India there are flour-mills in which  wheat is ground with the latest machinery, and when obtained from them,  bran differs but little from what is seen in England; but in smaller  places wheat is ground by native mills, and then the bran is not so clean.  When native-made bran is run over the hand, it will be seen that there is  a large amount of flour in it, which adheres to the skin like a white  powder, and which makes it much more nourishing than the cleaner prepared  article. The scales also of native-made bran are much more irregular in  size than the European manufactured article. Bran should have a clean,  fresh smell about it, and the newer it is the better; if kept long it is  likely to get mouldy. This is particularly the case during the rainy  season, when the atmosphere being saturated with moisture, a good deal is  absorbed by the bran, and if kept in this state for any time will get  mouldy. On this account, if it is necessary to store bran during the rainy  season, it should be kept in tin boxes. The inside lining of old packing  cases, in which perishable goods are brought out from England, do well for  this purpose, and plenty can be got for a small sum in the bazaar shops;  or, if not, any native tinsmith will make a box out of old kerosine oil  tins for a small sum.      Bran Mash.    It is a good plan, particularly in warm weather, in any country to give  horses a bran mash once a week, and if one particular evening is fixed  upon, syces get into the habit of giving it regularly without special  orders. I generally used to give a standing order to give it on Saturday  night, for, as a rule, the horses are not required on Sunday. Bran has a  slightly relaxing effect, that in warm climates is particularly  beneficial. Bran mash is made by simply putting the necessary quantity of  bran into a bucket, pouring boiling water gradually on to it, at the same  time stirring it round with a stick until the whole is moist and mixed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#2)"],[1," Miller (1924:2) used it, to denote  the sum of the physical modifications which any mammal, or taxonomic  category of mammals, is supposed by the author to have undergone during  the course of its development away from its original or generalized  mammalian stock.

For each subspecies, or species if it has not been divided into  subspecies, there is given (1) the accepted scientific name (selected  in accordance with the rules of the International Commission of  Zoological Nomenclature); (2) a citation to the account in which the  terminal part of the name was first proposed (the original description  of zoological parlance) followed by a statement of the type locality;  (3) a citation to the account in which the combination of names  (generic, specific and subspecific) used in the present account first  was employed unless the name combination used here is the same as that  in the original description; (4) synonyms arranged in chronological  order, and (5) marginal record stations of occurrence.    These marginal records are arranged in clockwise order beginning with  the northernmost locality. If more than one of the marginal localities  lies on the line of latitude that is northernmost for a given kind of  mammal, the westernmost of these is recorded first.

Order LAGOMORPHA--Hares, Rabbits and Pikas        Families and genera revised by Lyon, Smithsonian Miscl. Coll.,      45:321-447, June 15, 1904. For taxonomic status of group see Gidley,      Science, n. s., 36:285-286, August 30, 1912.    The order Lagomorpha is old in the geological sense; fossilized bones  and teeth of both pikas and rabbits are known from deposits of Oligocene  age and even at that early time the structural features distinguishing  these animals from other orders were well developed.    A noteworthy character of the order is the presence of four upper  incisor teeth (instead of only two as in the Rodentia); also, the fibula  is ankylosed to the tibia and articulates with the calcaneum. Each of  the first upper incisors has a longitudinal groove on its anterior face.    All lagomorphs are herbivorous. They eat principally leaves and  non-woody stems although the bark of sprouts and bushes is taken as  second choice by rabbits and hares.    Correlation of structure and function is well illustrated among the  lagomorphs by the means which the different species employ to detect and  escape from their enemies. A gradient series is evident in which the  pikas and jack rabbits are the extremes. The black-tailed jack rabbit,  for example, in relation to size of the entire animal, has the longest  ears and longest hind legs. This kind of lagomorph takes alarm when an  enemy, for example, a coyote, is yet a long way off. The jack rabbit  seeks safety in running; even when being overtaken by a pursuer that is  close behind, the jack rabbit still relies on its running ability  instead of entering thick brush or a hole in the ground where its  larger-sized pursuer would be unable to follow. A cottontail has shorter  ears and shorter hind legs. It allows the enemy to approach more closely  than the jack rabbit does before running, and then, although relying in  some measure on its running ability for escape, flees to a burrow or  thicket for safety from its pursuer. The brush rabbit with ears and hind  legs shorter than those of the cottontail seldom if ever ventures  farther than 45 feet away from the edge of dense cover. After an enemy  is near, the brush rabbit has merely to scamper back into the brush.  Still shorter of ear and hind leg is the pigmy rabbit which ventures  outside its burrow to feed only among the tall and closely-spaced bushes  of sagebrush among which its burrow is dug. Detection of the slightest  movement of an enemy on the opposite side of the bush sends the pigmy  rabbit, in one or a few jumps, into the mouth of its burrow and, if  need be, below ground. The pika, with the shortest ears and legs of all,  lives in the rock slides and has to do little more than drop off the top  of a rock into a space between the broken rocks when an enemy is  detected near enough to the pika to have a chance of seizing it.    The number of molts in a year, depending on the kind of lagomorph,  varies in adults from one (according to Nelson, 1909:31) in the  cottontails (genus _Sylvilagus_) to as many as three (according to  Lyman, 1943, and Severaid, 1945) in the varying hare (_Lepus  americanus_). Difficulties that I have experienced in attempting to  account for the variations in color and wear of the pelage of the pika,  _Ochotona princeps_, on the basis of two molts per year, make me wonder  if it, too, has three molts. _Lepus townsendii_ certainly has at least  two molts per year.

All of the living members of the family Ochotonidae belong to this  genus. American pikas all belong to the subgenus _Pika_, which occurs  also in Eurasia.    The distribution is boreal and the animals live in talus. This broken  rock at the foot of a cliff provides interstices in which the animals  live and store grass and herbs. These plant materials are cut for food  and stacked in piles to dry in the sun, often beneath slabs of rock  which protect the hay-piles from rain. Pikas are diurnal, active  throughout the year, and have a characteristic call, \"chickck-chickck.\"  Young number two to five per litter.
