Judging by the relative size of the feelers and the eyes, do you  think the fly relies more upon its sight or its feeling? Since the  eyes can probably see you any place where you see them, determine  through how much of a circle the fly can see.    5. How does the fly eat? Does it eat solid or liquid food?    6. Where is the extensible mouth (_proboscis_) kept when not in use?  What is the fly doing when \"washing its face\"?    7. From your own observation in the barn and the alley what do you  know about the fly's cleanliness in choosing its food? How would it  affect articles in the pantry?    8. From the foregoing statements show how flies may be a serious  factor in dealing with disease.    9. What means may be employed as protection against adult flies?  against their breeding places and \"maggots\"?          _Suggested drawing._    a. The entire fly, seen from above, x 4.      THE LIVING MAGGOT          _Materials._    Living specimens in pans or cotton-stoppered bottles, with some food  material and moist cloth or paper; lenses.          _Observations._    Notice the general worm-like form of the maggot, or grub, the plain  and uniform color, and the absence of all elaborate structures, as  wings and feelers.    1. Since this creature is destined to become a flying or walking  insect, what organs will have to appear? Is there any indication of  these structures at present?    2. Give the color of the specimen, and explain how the presence or  absence of strong light seems to have affected the color. Is this  effect usual in animals or plants that you know?    3. Tell how the animal gets from place to place, describing any  special structures you find which aid in this work.    4. How can you tell the head end? Tell how the amount of work that  the mouth and mouth parts do affects their size and indirectly that  of the region where they are.    5. What senses and sense organs has the maggot? Test any of these  senses or organs gently, by any means at your disposal, or recall any  experience you have had along this line. Which senses or organs seem  to be best developed?      6. Explain briefly how the active or sluggish habits either    determine or are determined by the condition of the senses or    sense organs.      7. Since \"Mother Nature\" seems to want maggots to develop    rapidly, tell how she economizes in energy and material when    forming them.      8. Show how the development of maggots in refuse matter is    actually beneficial.      9. From the standpoint of flies and human welfare, show why    maggots should not be allowed to live,--stating how they may be    prevented.      10. Look up the story of the pupa of the house fly; the    development and work of the botfly; of the ox-warble; of the    tsetse fly.          _Suggested drawing._    a. The maggot or grub, side view, x 4.      THE LIVING COCKROACH          _Materials._    Individual specimens in cages, jars, or wide-mouth vials with cotton  stoppers to admit air. Several roaches in large cages with material  for food and concealment.          _Observations._    1. What is the general color and the average size of cockroaches?    2. During what time of the day are roaches most active? Where do they  hide at other times? How do their shape and color aid concealment?  Note any odd or striking colors or marks which might make them  distinguishable to their mates.    3. Is the roach a quick or a slow moving animal? How does it get  about,--by running, jumping, walking, crawling, swimming, or flying?  Turn your specimen on its back and see how it recovers its proper  position. Notice the relative size and development of the wings and  their use in flying.    4. If uninjured, your specimen has six legs. Why don't they step on  each other? Notice the stiff hairs on the legs and the white pads  under the feet. How would these structures be useful to the animal?    5. The large, black, shiny eyes are on the front and sides of the  head; the long \"horns,\" or feelers, are attached just below the eyes.  Upon which sense, sight or feeling, do you think the roach depends  more? Explain your statement.    6. Beside the mouth are a long and a short pair of \"feelers\"; perhaps  these are for tasting or smelling. What do roaches like to eat? Do  they choose their food? What damage do they do?      7. How can a house be rid of cockroaches?          _Suggested drawing._    a. A cockroach, seen from above.      THE LIVING SPIDER          _Materials._    Living spiders, preferably large ones, in cages; individual specimens  in battery jars or wide-mouth bottles. Cocoons. Simple lenses.          _Observations._    Each pupil may feel sure that if treated fairly any of the common  spiders may be handled without fear of bite or injury.    1. Note that the spider's body is of two regions, the head-thorax and  the abdomen, and that it is supported by eight legs. To what part of  the body are the legs attached?    2. Find the feelers; if they are club-shaped, your specimen is a  male. State their number and tell where they are attached. What is  the sex of your spider?    3. Usually there are eight tiny near-sighted eyes on the front of the  head. State the color of the eyes and by a diagram indicate their  arrangement.    4. With what kind of material is the body covered (use the lens)?    5. What is the color of your specimen? What special markings has it?      Find out the name of your kind of spider.    6. Holding the spider aloft in your fingers, allow it to drop upon  the thread it will spin, and watch it climb and spin. Record the  number of the spinners, their situation, and how they act. Are the  threads sticky? If so, why doesn't the spider stick to its web? Is  the web used for a home or for a snare?    7. Try to discover how the feet are enabled to cling to the thread.    8. Examine a cocoon, noting its outer form and structure, and look  for an opening at the top. If you can open a cocoon carefully with  scissors, look for its two coats and inspect its contents.    9. State three uses for the spider's silk.      10. What is the work of spiders amongst the animal population of    the earth, or of what use are they?      11. Out of doors find webs of various kinds: wheel web, tent web,    triangle web, etc.      12. How do the jumping spiders differ from others in their    spinning and feeding habits?      13. Look up what is meant by ballooning spiders. Find out when    ballooning occurs and what is accomplished by it.          _Suggested drawings._    a. The entire spider, seen from above.    b. A cocoon.      THE LIVING CRICKET          _Materials._    Living crickets in cages, with materials for food and concealment,  and individual specimens in wide-mouth bottles or vials with cotton  stoppers.          _Observations._    1. What is the average size and the general color of crickets?    2. Just what do they do when you try to catch them? What structures  enable them to do these things?    3. Of the three pairs of legs, which extend sidewise for running or  grasping, and which backward for jumping or climbing? What structures  have the legs to enable them to do their work properly?    4. Notice how well developed the cricket's wings are, and state how  much they are used or how they influence the habits of the animal.    5. How many projecting spines are there on the hinder end of the  body? Are they ornamental or useful? how? The female crickets have a  special spear-shaped spine for depositing eggs.    6. In a column make a list of the senses (sight, feeling, etc.), and  opposite each state what kind of an organ is used and where it is  located. The ears are oblong white spots on the second long piece of  the front legs.    7. Find out whether the cricket chews solid food or sucks liquid  food, and whether it has biting jaws or protrusible lips. See whether  it will attack a toothpick or your finger, and if the crickets  have been confined long, whether there has been any attempt at  cannabalism. Is its natural food animal or vegetable matter?      8. How do crickets chirp?      9. What work do they do in nature?      10. How does a baby cricket develop?      THE LIVING GRASSHOPPER OR LOCUST          _Materials._    Individual specimens in wide-mouth bottles or jars, and other  specimens in cages, with turf or foliage for food and concealment.  Simple lenses.          _Observations._    Notice the form and size of your specimen, its color, the number of  its legs and of its feelers. Find the eyes; the two large eyes, a  tiny one between the two feelers, and near the inner edge of each  large eye, another tiny one. With a lens notice the markings on the  large eyes. Find the mouth, and note its lips and finger-like  feelers. Draw out an outer wing, and then carefully draw out the  delicate under wing, allowing them both to fold into place again.  Under the wings find the circular or crescent-shaped membranes, the  eardrums. Watch the grasshopper's body expand and contract in  breathing, and find the small breathing holes along each side the  body. Compare its rate of breathing with your own.          _Questions._    1. In what surroundings and how does the grasshopper's color protect  it? What color markings has it which might serve for other  grasshoppers to see as signals? Explain how this signaling is done.    2. Explain how the legs are placed so as to act as springs in jumping  and alighting.    3. What advantages in having the wings attached on the upper side and  the legs on the under side of the body?    4. Explain how the small wings are protective, and how the large ones  are protected.    5. Why is it better for the grasshopper to have its mouth on the  under side of its head instead of in front?    6. The large eyes are supposed to be far-sighted, the small ones  near-sighted. State how the large eyes have the more advantageous  position, and around how much of a circle they can see.    7.

Two were shot, one  was captured and returned to the mainland, and the male escaped; his  fate is unknown.    The second transplant effort took place on uninhabited, 36-square-mile  (92 km^{2}) Coronation Island in southeastern Alaska (Merriam 1964; Mech  1970). In 1960, two male and two female, 19-month-old captive wolves,  were released there. They learned to prey on black-tailed deer  (_Odocoileus hemionus columbianus_), and multiplied to about 11 members  by 1964.    In the third case, two male and three female laboratory wolves from  Barrow, Alaska were released near Umiat in August 1972, 175 miles (282  km) southeast of Barrow (Henshaw and Stephenson 1974). Eventually, all  moved toward centers of human habitation and three were shot within 7  months. A fourth returned to the pens where she was reared, and was  recaptured, while the fate of the fifth wolf remains unknown. Three of  the five had taken the correct homing direction.    Because results of the earlier attempts at translocating wolves  suggested that pen-reared wolves did not fare well in the wild, we  decided to use wild wolves that were accustomed to fending for  themselves and avoiding people. They would have to be released in the  most inaccessible area we could find and encouraged to stay there. To  maximize their chances of breeding, we would have to try to obtain  animals with already established social ties, that is, members of the  same pack. Approval was obtained from the Minnesota Department of  Natural Resources to live-trap up to five wolves in Minnesota, and a  permit was granted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to  release up to five in Upper Michigan.    This bulletin describes the results of the experimental translocation.                                       THE STUDY AREA      The area selected for the release of the translocated wolves was the  Huron Mountain area (Fig. 2) in northern Marquette County in the Upper  Peninsula of Michigan (47 deg. N Latitude; 88 deg. W Longitude). This is  one of the largest roadless tracts in Michigan, and has one of the  lowest year-around densities of resident humans. Much of the area is  owned by the Huron Mountain Club, on which accessibility is restricted.    The Upper Peninsula is 16,491 square miles (42,693 km^{2}) in area,  bounded by Lake Superior to the north, and by Lakes Huron and Michigan  to the east and south. The Wisconsin border along the western portion of  the Upper Peninsula forms no distinctive ecological boundary. The Upper  Peninsula is in the Canadian biotic province (Dice 1952), characterized  by a northern hardwoods climax, interspersed with spruce-fir and pine  subclimaxes. The northwestern portion of the Upper Peninsula, including  Marquette, Baraga, Houghton, Ontonagon, and Iron Counties, contains  rugged highlands and rock outcroppings which rise to elevations  approaching 2,000 feet (610 m) in several locations.    The human population of the Upper Peninsula is 303,342, with a rural  density of about 9.0 persons per square mile or 3.5 persons per square  kilometer (Table 1). The population of the Upper Peninsula has remained  at about 300,000 for the past 50 years, and the rural human populations  of local areas have generally declined or remained stable. During those  50 years, the wolf population has declined from several hundred animals  to near extinction, with the population estimated by Hendrickson et al.  (1975) at 6 to 10 remaining wolves. These authors concluded that the  bounty on wolves between 1935 and 1960 was largely responsible for the  demise of the species in the Upper Peninsula. The bounty was removed  in 1960, after only one wolf was taken in 1959. Legal protection was  granted by Michigan in 1965. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 added  federal protection in 1974.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources pellet  count estimates for the spring deer population in the Upper Peninsula in  1973 was 10 +/- 21.9% deer per square mile (3.9 +/- 21.9% per km^{2}). Deer  densities of 10 to 15 per square mile (3.9 to 5.8 per km^{2}) supported  wolf densities of one wolf per 10 square miles (26 km^{2}) in Algonquin  Provincial Park, Ontario (Pimlott 1967).    The population of deer wintering on the 14 square-mile (36 km^{2}) Huron  Mountain deer yard in winter 1973-74 was estimated at 73.3 +/- 49.5% deer  per square mile (28.3 +/- 49.5% deer per km^{2}) by the pellet count  method (Laundre 1975). Thus total wintering population on the Huron  Mountain Club, the wolf release area, would be about 1,000 deer.    The utilization of available browse by deer in the Huron Mountain deer  yard reached 95% by March 8, 1969 and 92% by March 5, 1970 (Westover  1971). The minimum winter deer loss (actual number found) in 1969 was 40  animals, of which at least 12 had starved, and it was estimated that  perhaps up to 33% of the deer starved in the Huron Mountain Yard in  1968-69 (Westover 1971). The Huron Mountain yard continues to be  overbrowsed, with high deer mortality expected in severe winters. Many  other northern deer yards of the Upper Peninsula are also overbrowsed  and are dwindling in area. Thus we expected that numbers of vulnerable  deer (Pimlott et al. 1969; Mech and Frenzel 1971) would be available to  wolves.    Beavers (_Castor canadensis_) are an important food source for wolves in  many areas during summer (Mech 1970), and they are common throughout the  Upper Peninsula. The beaver population on the 26 square-mile (67 km^{2})  Huron Mountain Club was estimated at 46.9, or about 1.9 beavers per  square mile (0.7 per km^{2}) (Laundre 1975). Moose (_Alces alces_) are  rare on mainland Michigan.                                          METHODS      The general procedure for this study was to attempt to capture an intact  pack of wolves in Minnesota, fit each animal with a radio-collar  (Cochran & Lord 1963), release them in northern Michigan, and follow  their fate through aerial and ground radio-tracking (Kolenosky and  Johnston 1967).    A pack was selected from an area near Ray, Minnesota (Fig. 3), south of  International Falls (48 deg. N Latitude, 93 deg. W Longitude), where wolf  hunting and trapping were legal. Two male and two female wolves were  captured by professional trapper Robert Himes, under contract for the  project, between December 24, 1973 and January 21, 1974 (Table 2). Three  of the wolves were trapped (Fig. 4) in No. 4 or 14 steel traps (Mech  1974), and one (No. 13) was live-snared (Nellis 1968). If these animals  had not been solicited for this study, they would have been killed and  their pelts sold, as part of the trapper's livelihood, before the  Endangered Species Act of 1973 took effect.    [Illustration: _Fig. 3.--Capture and release points of the translocated  wolves_]    At capture each wolf was immobilized with a combination of phencyclidine  hydrochloride (Sernylan) and promazine hydrochloride (Sparine)  intramuscularly (Mech 1974), with dosage recommendations from Seal et  al. (1970). They were then carried out of the woods (Fig. 5), held in  pens in Minnesota, and fed road-killed white-tailed deer, supplemented  with beef scraps.    [Illustration: _Fig. 4.--Wolf caught in trap (Photo by Don Breneman)_]    [Illustration: _Fig. 5.--The captured wolves were drugged and carried to  an enclosure in Minnesota (USFWS Photo by L. David Mech)_]    There is no certain way of ascertaining that wolves are related or that  they belong to the same pack. Thus to maximize chances that members of  the same pack would be captured, the trapper set traps where he  suspected only one pack ranged. To try to determine whether the  individual wolves he caught were socially related, we instructed the  trapper to hold the wolves in individual pens until we could observe  their introductions to each other. Wolves No. 10 and 11 were placed  together on January 23, 1974, and No. 13 and 14 were released into the  pen with No. 10 and 11 on February 4.
