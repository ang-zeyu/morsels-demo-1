C and D.--Hand and foot of _Hyla s. staufferi_x (KU    57790), x 6]    In life, dorsum tan or brown with dark spots on snout, head, and  scapular region; interorbital triangle and blotch posteriorly on dorsum  dark brown; flanks pale green; groin pale green or orange, mottled with  dark brown; thighs tan or brown above with dark transverse bars on  anterior and posterior surfaces; spaces between bars green or orange;  inner surfaces of shanks and outer surfaces of tarsi brown and orange;  foot brown above; forelimbs brown and pale green above, weakly barred;  belly creamy white with scattered brown spots; vocal sac creamy white  flecked with brown; lower jaw brown with white spots on lips (Pl. 1A).    In preservative, head and dorsum dark brown with triangular spot  between eyes; dark spots on head and scapular region and dark brown  blotch posteriorly on dorsum; flanks creamy white with brown spots;  groin creamy white mottled with dark brown; thighs brown above with  dark brown transverse bars on anterior and posterior surfaces; inner  surfaces of shanks and outer surfaces of tarsi barred with pale brown;  dorsal surface of foot mottled brown and creamy white; ventral surface  of foot and toes pale brown; forelimbs faintly barred with pale brown;  belly white with a few pale brown spots; vocal sac flecked with pale  brown; lower jaw marked with small white spots on lips.    _Variation._--Geographic variation is evident in the snout-vent length,  tibia length, and foot length, all in relation to snout-vent length,  and the relative size of the tympanum to the eye (Table 1). The largest  specimens are from the humid Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica;  individuals from the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, Canal Zone, and  South America are smaller. A general trend for increase in size extends  from South America to the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica.    Most variation in color does not seem to be correlated with geography;  color variation is nearly as great within a given population as between  separated populations. However, most specimens from Rincon de Osa,  Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, are dusky brown, but a few are darker.  In comparison with specimens from the Caribbean lowlands of Central  America, specimens from the Pacific slopes in Costa Rica have a darker  interorbital triangle. In some specimens from the latter area  rugosities are present on the borders of the interorbital triangle, on  the snout, on the upper eyelid, and on the heel. Specimens from the  Caribbean lowlands are less tuberculate, and most individuals from  there lack rugosities on the tarsus. Living individuals from Puerto  Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, and from the Canal Zone, Panama,  are brown above with a metallic green tint. Rugosities are present on  the posterior edges of the forelimbs in some specimens from throughout  the range. In most respects, specimens from the Canal Zone resemble  those from the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica more than they resemble  those from the Pacific lowlands of Costa Rica, but some individuals  from the Canal Zone are less metallic above and have small white spots  dorsally on the body, head, and limbs.    A moderate amount of color change from night to day has been noted. At  night, a male from Puerto Viejo, Heredia Province, Costa Rica, was  grayish tan above with slightly darker markings; the flanks were pale  yellowish green. By day, the dorsum was brown with darker markings, and  the throat was pale gray with white flecks; the rest of the venter was  creamy white. The groin was pale green with black mottling; the  anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs and inner edges of the  tarsi were greenish yellow with black bars.

(#2)"],[1,"name get love and commendation.    How happy it would make me if I thought the perusal of these few pages  would induce any one to pause and reflect before condemning any one  animal! And here I do not refer to my own race alone, but to the world  of beasts at large; whether the Lion, creating a sensation in the class  to which he belongs, or the Ass, laughed at for his stupidity in the  circle to which his position in life assigns him. The same animal would  often be judged differently if differently situated: were the Lion and  the Ass, by some freak of nature, to change places, the stupidity of the  latter would be set down as wit, and his every saying would be  applauded; whilst the Lion, instead of being looked on as the perfection  of nobleness and beauty, would be styled a surly brute, and considered  at the best no better than a bore.    I think I hear some of my readers exclaim, \"Who is this old Cat,  forsooth, that she should thus presume to teach us lessons? The 'itch  for scratching' must be very strong upon her that she should insist on  swelling her tale in so outrageous a manner!\" I own my fault, and will  bring my musings to a stop.    My wish was to meet my readers with a friendly rub; my desire was to  part from them with a gentle warning. Above all, my wish was to have  them think of me kindly; for, though a Cat, and no longer young,--though  no more possessed of those graces which once distinguished me, when the  eye, as I have been told, felt pleasure in gazing on my form,--my heart  still beats warmly, tenderly, and without envy, and would feel no common  joy if it thought it had not dwelt in this earthly abode in vain.    [Illustration: A JUVENILE PARTY.]          KITTENHOOD.      There is nothing like beginning at the very commencement of a story, if  we wish it to be thoroughly understood; at least, _I_ think so; and, as  I wish _my_ story to be clear and intelligible, in order that it may  furnish a hint or a warning to others, I shall at least act up to my  opinion, and begin at the beginning,--I may say, at the very tip of my  tale.    Being now a Cat of some years' standing (I do not much like remembering  how many), I was of course a Kitten on making my entry into life,--my  first appearance being in company with a brother and three sisters.    We were all declared to be \"the prettiest little darlings that ever  were seen;\" but as the old Puss who made the remark had said precisely  the same thing at sight of every fresh Kitten she beheld, and she was  accustomed to see ten or twelve new ones every week, the observation is  no proof of our being very charming or very beautiful.    I cannot remember what passed during the first few days of my existence,  for my eyes were close-shut till the ninth morning. I have an indistinct  recollection however of overhearing a few words which passed between my  mother and a friend of the family who had dropped in for a little chat,  on the evening of the eighth day.    The latter had been remarking on my efforts to unclose my lids, to  obtain a little peep at what was going on, when my good parent  exclaimed,    \"Ah! yes, she tries hard enough to stare at life now, because she knows  nothing of it; but when she is as old as you or I, neighbour, she will  wish more than once that she had always kept her eyes closed, or she  is no true Cat.\"    I could not of course, at the time, have any notion what my mother  meant, but I think, indeed I am _sure_, that I have discovered her  meaning long ago; and all those who have lived to have sorrow,--and  who has not?--will understand it too.    I had found my tongue and my legs, and so had my brother and sisters,  before we got the use of our eyes. With the first we kept up a perfect  concert of sounds; the legs we employed in dragging our bodies about our  capacious cradle, crawling over each other, and getting in everybody's  way, for we somehow managed, in the dark as we were, to climb to the  edge of our bed and roll quickly over it, much to our astonishment and  the amusement or annoyance of the family, just as they happened to be  in the humour.    Our sight was at last granted us. On that eventful morning our mother  stepped gently into our bed, which she had left an hour before; and,  taking us one by one in her maternal embrace, she held us down with her  legs and paws, and licked us with more affection and assiduity than she  had ever bestowed on our toilet before. Her tongue, which she rendered  as soft for the occasion as a Cat's tongue can be made, I felt pass and  repass over my eyes until the lids burst asunder, and I could _see_!    And what a confusion of objects I first beheld! It seemed as if  everything above was about to fall upon my head and crush me, and that  everything around was like a wall to prevent my moving; and when, after  a day or two, I began to understand better the distance that these  objects were from me, I fell into the opposite error, and hurt my nose  not a little through running it against a chair, which I fancied to  be very much further off. These difficulties however soon wore away.  Experience, bought at the price of some hard knocks, taught me better;  and, a month after my first peep at the world, it seemed almost  impossible I could ever have been so ignorant.    No doubt my brother and sisters procured their knowledge in a similar  way: it is certain that it cost them something. One incident, which  happened to my brother, I particularly remember; and it will serve to  prove that he did not get _his_ experience for nothing.    We were all playing about the room by ourselves, our mother being out  visiting or marketing, I do not know which, and the nurse, who was  charged to take care of us, preferring to chat to the handsome footman  in the tortoise-shell coat over the way, to looking after us Kittens.    A large pan full of something sticky, but I do not remember what, was in  a corner; and as the edge of it was very broad, we climbed on to it and  peeped in.    Our brother, who was very venturesome, said he could jump over it to the  opposite brim. We said it was not possible, for the pan was broad and  rather slippery; and what a thing it would be if he fell into it! But  the more we exclaimed about its difficulty, the more resolved he was to  try.    Getting his legs together, he gave a spring; but, slipping just as he  got to the other side, his claws could not catch hold of anything to  support himself, and he went splash backwards into the sticky mess.  His screams, and indeed ours, ought to have been enough to call nurse  to our assistance; but she was making such a noise herself with the  tortoise-shell footman, that my brother might have been drowned or  suffocated before _she_ would have come to his assistance. As it was, he  managed to drag himself to the edge without any help at all; and as we  feared that all of us would get punished if the adventure were known, my  sisters and myself set to work and licked him all over; and then getting  into bed, we cuddled up together to make him dry, and were soon fast  asleep.    Although the accident was not known at the time, we all suffered for it;  for my brother caught a dreadful cold, and myself and sisters were ill  for several days, through the quantity of the stuff we had licked off my  brother's coat, and one of us nearly died through it.    As we grew stronger and older, we were permitted, under the care of our  nurse, to go into the country for a few hours to play. It may be perhaps  thought, from what I have said, that nurse's care was not worth much,  and that we might just as well have looked after ourselves, as the  poorer Kittens of our city were accustomed to do. But this was not  precisely the case; for when nurse had nobody to chat with she was very  strict with us, I assure you, and on such occasions made up for her  inattention at other times. That unlucky fondness of hers however for  gossiping, was the cause of a great deal of mischief; and about this  time it partly occasioned a sad misfortune in our family. I said  _partly_, because the accident was also due to an act of disobedience;  and as the adventure may serve as a double warning, I will briefly  relate it.    It was a lovely morning in early summer; the sun shone gaily upon the  city, looked at his brilliant face in the river, danced about among the  leaves of the trees, and polished the coats of every Cat and Dog which  came out to enjoy the beautiful day he was making.    To our great delight we were allowed to take a long walk in the country.  Two of our cousins, and a young Pussy who was visiting at our house,  were to accompany us; and nurse had strict charge to prevent our getting  into mischief. Before we started our mother called us and said, that,  although she had desired nurse to look after us, and take care that no  harm should happen while we were out, she desired also that we should  take care of _ourselves_, and behave like Kittens of station and  good-breeding, not like the young Cats about the streets, poor things!  who had no home except the first hole they could creep into, no food but  what they could pick up or steal, and no father or mother that they knew  of to teach them what was good. Such creatures were to be pitied and  relieved, but not imitated; and she hoped we would, by our behaviour,  show that we bore her advice in mind. \"Above all,\" she added, \"do not  let me hear of your climbing and racing about in a rude and extravagant  way, for a great deal of mischief is often done by such rough modes of  amusement.\"    We hastily promised all and everything. If we had kept our words, we  should have been perfect angels of Cats, for we declared in a chorus  that we would do only what was good, and would carefully avoid  everything that was evil; and with these fine promises in our mouths,  we started off in pairs under the guidance of nurse.    We soon came to the wood, situated at some"]]]
