Elevations range from sea level to 300 meters. The area is in general a  flat plain inclined to the sea but this plain is broken by several  small sierras. The more important of these are the Sierra de  Tamaulipas, which rises to more than 1000 meters, and the Sierra San  Carlos, which has a maximum elevation of approximately 1670 meters. The  Sierra de San Jose de las Rucias is smaller.      Sierra Madre Oriental    This physiographic region is represented in Tamaulipas by a small part  of the long Sierra Madre Oriental that extends from the Big Bend area  in Texas southward to the Trans-volcanic Belt of central Mexico. The  Sierra Madre Oriental is in the southwestern part of Tamaulipas. The  Sierra was formed by folding of the Middle and Upper Cretaceous and  Cenozoic deposits that now are 400 to 2700 meters in elevation. In  general, the soils are Chernozems.    This physiographic region is situated between the other two  physiographic regions in Tamaulipas and represents a barrier to the  distribution of some tropical mammals on the one hand and to those from  the Mexican Plateau on the other.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Three physiographic regions: 1 Coastal Plain; 2  Sierra Madre Oriental; 3 Central Plateau.]      Central Plateau    This physiographic region, commonly termed the Mexican Plateau,  occupies only a small area of Tamaulipas in its southwesternmost part.  The plateau is approximately 900 meters above sea level. In general,  the Mexican Plateau was formed by Cretaceous sediments. The most common  type of soil is Chestnut.          CLIMATE      Owing to the differences in elevations and varying distances from the  sea, the climate of Tamaulipas is varied. Tamayo (1949), following the  Koeppen System, assigned to Tamaulipas 10 different climate types that  result principally from differences in temperature, precipitation, and  humidity.      Temperature    The annual mean temperature for the lands less than 1000 meters in  elevation, which make up most of the state, is between 20 deg. and 25 deg. C.;  and the difference in monthly means is 5 deg. C.    In the areas above 1000 meters, the annual mean is between 15 deg. and 20 deg.  C., and the difference in the monthly means is 15 deg. C.    The maximum temperature recorded in the state is 45 deg. C. in the region  of Ciudad Victoria, between the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra San  Carlos, and the Sierra de Tamaulipas. Minima recorded are between O deg.  and 5 deg. C. on the southeastern coast, O deg. to -5 deg. C. between 98 deg. 20' long.  and 99 deg. 00' long., and -5 deg. to -10 deg. C. in the Sierra Madre Oriental.      Precipitation    Rainfall varies seasonally and can be described as follows: In January  it amounts to 25 to 50 mm. in the coastal region and 10 to 25 mm. in  the rest of the state. In April there is more than 25 mm. to the north  of about 23 deg. north latitude, 10 to 25 mm. in the Sierra de Tamaulipas  and Sierra Madre Oriental, and less than 10 mm. in the extreme  southwestern part of the state.    In July rainfall amounts to less than 25 mm. in Nuevo Laredo and San  Fernando, is from 25 to 50 mm. in the northeastern and central parts of  the state, 50 to 100 mm. in the Sierra San Carlos and Sierra Madre  Oriental, and 100 to 200 mm. in the area south of Soto la Marina and  east of the Sierra Madre Oriental. In October rainfall is less than 50  mm. in the northern half of the state, including the Sierra de  Tamaulipas, and 50 to 100 mm. in the rest of the state, except on the  east side of the Sierra Madre Oriental and in the area near Tampico,  which receive between 100 and 200 mm.    The number of rainy days per year varies from 60 to 90 at Sierra San  Carlos, Sierra Madre Oriental, and in the lowlands south of 23 deg. north  latitude; the rest of the state has about 60 rainy days, excepting the  Mexican Plateau, which has fewer than 60.    Although Tamayo (1949) followed the Koeppen System in classifying types  of climate and thereby recognized 10 different kinds of climate in  Tamaulipas, these can be grouped into three major categories as  follows:      Steppe Dry Climate (Clima Seco de Estepa)    This kind of climate can be divided into two categories based on the  average annual temperature.      _Warm_    The average annual temperature exceeds 18 deg. C. but the mean of the  coolest month is less than 18 deg. C. This sub-climate is characterized by  a short rainy season in summer and occurs on the west side of the  southern part of the Sierra Madre Oriental and on the Mexican Plateau;  it occurs also in the area northwest of Reynosa and on the east side of  the Sierra Madre Oriental but in these areas the rainfall is  irregularly distributed in the year.      _Cool_    The average annual temperature is less than 18 deg. C. but the mean of the  warmest month exceeds 18 deg. C. This sub-climate occurs only on the west  side of the northern part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.      Moderate Rainy Temperature Climate (Clima Templado Moderato Lluvioso)    This type of climate is characterized by the coolest month having a  temperature of between -3 deg. and 18 deg. C. In the northeastern and central  parts of Tamaulipas, including the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Ciudad  Victoria, Gomez Farias, Rancho Pano Ayuctle, and Llera, the average  temperature of the warmest month is less than 22 deg. C.; the winters are  dry and not rigorous, and the wettest month has ten times as much rain  as the driest. In the Sierra San Carlos the average temperature of the  warmest month is less than 22 deg. C., and the rainy season is in the  autumn.      Tropical Rainy Climate (Clima Tropical Lluvioso)    This climate is characterized by the average temperature of all months  being above 18 deg. C. and the mean-annual rainfall being above 75 cm.  According to the distribution of precipitation this type of climate can  be divided into: (1) areas having periodic rain and wet winters  (southeastern Tamaulipas, south of 22 deg. north latitude and east of 99 deg.  west longitude), and (2) areas having an irregular rainy season and dry  winters (area around Ciudad Mante, between 99 deg. 30' and 98 deg. 30' west  longitude and south of 22 deg. 30' north latitude).          AFFINITIES OF TAMAULIPAN MAMMALS      Owing to the differences in climate from one region to another, the  flora and fauna also differ, especially in the southern part of the  state as compared with the northern part.         For expressing the taxonomic resemblance of mammalian faunas       having nearly equal numbers of taxa, Burt (1959:139)       recommended the following formula: C x 100/(N_{1} + N_{2} - C)       (where C is the number of taxa common to the two faunas,       N_{1} is the number of taxa in the smaller fauna, and N_{2}       is the number of taxa in the larger fauna). For non-flying       mammals the resemblance of the Tamaulipan fauna to that of       Texas, adjacent to the north, and Veracruz, adjacent to the       south, is as follows:         _Genera._--Texas 65 per cent, Veracruz 60 per cent.         _Species._--Texas 45 per cent, Veracruz 39 per cent.         For bats the resemblance of the Tamaulipan fauna to those of       Texas and Veracruz is as follows:         _Genera._--Texas 40 per cent, Veracruz 51 per cent.         _Species._--Texas 24, Veracruz 39.

On the whole, the fauna of Tamaulipas resembles faunas of both the  Brazilian Subregion and the North American part of the Nearctic  Subregion (see Hershkovitz, 1958:611). Considering the 48 genera of  non-flying land mammals of Tamaulipas, 24 genera occur in habitats from  the North American part through habitats of northern Mexico into the  Brazilian Subregion. Of the remaining 24 genera, 16 occur in the North  American part of the Nearctic Subregion or in it and the part of  northern Mexico north of the Brazilian boundary, whereas eight occur in  the Brazilian Subregion or in it and the northern part of Mexico. None  occurs only in Tamaulipas or only in northern Mexico.    The non-flying fauna of the coastal plain east of the Sierra Madre  Oriental and south of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Soto la Marina is  mainly tropical in affinities; only 27 per cent of that fauna (at the  subspecific level) resembles the fauna north of Soto la Marina, which  is Nearctic in its affinities. The fauna of the Sierra de Tamaulipas  has a greater taxonomic resemblance (20.4 per cent at subspecific  level) to that of the Sierra Madre Oriental, than does the fauna of the  Sierra San Carlos (17.6 per cent). Taxonomic resemblance between the  faunas from the Sierra San Carlos and the Sierra de Tamaulipas amounts  to only 16.1 per cent. Therefore, the faunas of these two Sierras (both  are included in the same zoogeographic unit) resemble each other less  than either resembles the fauna of the Sierra Madre Oriental (in  another zoogeographic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39396"],[0,"A Population Study of the Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster) in Northeastern (#2)"],[1,"inadequate, vegetation was pulled and  piled over the nest boxes. The traps usually were faced north so that  the attached number-ten cans, which served as shelters, cast shadows  over the hardware cloth runways during midday. Even these measures were  inadequate when the temperature reached 90 deg.F. or above. Such high  temperatures rarely occurred early in the day, however, so that removal  of the animals from traps between eight and ten a. m. almost eliminated  mortality. Those individuals captured in the night were not yet harmed,  but it was already hot enough to reduce the activity of the voles and  prevent further captures until late afternoon. When it was necessary to  run trap lines earlier, the traps were closed in the morning and reset  in late afternoon.    Reactions of small mammals to live-traps and the effects of prebaiting  were described by Chitty and Kempson (1949). In general, the results of  my trapping program fit their conclusions. Each of my trapping periods,  consisting of seven to ten consecutive days, showed a gradual increase  in the number of captures per day for the first three days, with a  tendency for the number of captures to level off during the remainder of  the period. Leaving the traps baited and locked open for a day or two  before a trapping period tended to increase the catch during the first  few days of the period without any corresponding increase during the  latter part of the period. Initial reluctance of the voles to enter the  traps decreased as the traps became familiar parts of their environment.    At the beginning of the study the traps were set in a grid with  intervals of 20 feet. The interval was increased to 30 feet after three  months because a larger area could thus be covered and no loss in  trapping efficiency was apparent. The traps were set within a three foot  radius of the numbered stations, and were locked and left in position  between trapping periods.    Each individual that was captured was weighed and sexed. The resulting  data were recorded in a field notebook together with the location of the  capture and other pertinent information. Newly captured voles were  marked by toe-clipping as described by Fitch (1952:32). Information was  transferred from the field notebook to a file which contained a separate  card for each individual trapped.    In the course of the program of live-trapping, many marked voles were  recaptured one or more times. Most frequently captured among the females  were number 8 (33 captures in seven months) and number 73 (30 captures  in eight months). Among the males, number 37 (21 captures in six months)  and number 62 (21 captures in eight months) were most frequently taken.  The mean number of captures per individual was 3.6. For females, the  mean number of captures per individual was 3.8 and for males it was 3.4.  Females seemingly acquired the habit of entering traps more readily than  did males. No correlation between any seasonally variable factor and the  number of captures per individual was apparent. To a large degree, the  formation of trap habits by voles was an individual peculiarity.    In order to study the extent of utilization of various habitats by  _Microtus_, a number of areas were sampled with Museum Special  snap-traps. These traps were set in linear series approximately 25 feet  apart. The number of traps used varied with the size of the area sampled  and ranged from 20 to 75. The lines were maintained for three nights.  The catch was assumed to indicate the relative abundance of _Microtus_  and certain other small mammals but no attempt to estimate actual  population densities from snap-trapping data was made. In August, 1952,  when the live-trapping program was concluded, the study areas were  trapped out. The efficiency of the live-trapping procedure was  emphasized by the absence of unmarked individuals among the 45 voles  caught at that time.    Further details of the methods and procedures used are described in the  appropriate sections which follow.          HABITAT      Although other species of the genus _Microtus_, especially _M.  pennsylvanicus_, have been studied intensively in regard to habitat  preference (Blair, 1940:149; 1948:404-405; Bole, 1939:69; Eadie, 1953;  Gunderson, 1950:32-37; Hamilton, 1940:425-426; Hatt, 1930:521-526;  Townsend, 1935:96-101) little has been reported concerning the habitat  preferences of _M. ochrogaster_. Black (1937:200) reported that, in  Kansas, _Microtus_ (mostly _M. ochrogaster_) preferred damp situations.  _M. ochrogaster_ was studied in western Kansas by Brown (1946:453) and  Wooster (1935:352; 1936:396) and found to be almost restricted to the  little-bluestem association of the mixed prairie (Albertson, 1937:522).  Brumwell (1951:213), in a survey of the Fort Leavenworth Military  Reservation, found that _M. ochrogaster_ preferred sedge and bluegrass  meadows but occurred also in a sedge-willow association. Dice (1922:46)  concluded that the presence of green herbage, roots or tubers for use as  a water source throughout the year was a necessity for _M. ochrogaster_.  Goodpastor and Hoffmeister (1952:370) found _M. ochrogaster_ to be  abundant in a damp meadow of a lake margin in Tennessee. In a study made  on and near the campus of the University of Kansas, within a few miles  of the area concerned in the present report, Jameson (1947:132) found  that voles used grassy areas in spring and summer, but that in the  autumn, when the grass began to dry, they moved to clumps of Japanese  honeysuckle (_Lonicera japonica_) and stayed among the shrubbery  throughout the winter. Johnson (1926:267, 270) found _M. ochrogaster_  only in uncultivated areas where long grass furnished adequate cover. He  stated that the entire biotic association, rather than any single  factor, was the key to the distribution of the voles. None of these  reports described an intensive study of the habitat of voles, but the  data presented indicate that voles are characteristic of grassland and  that _M. ochrogaster_ can occupy drier areas than those used by _M.  pennsylvanicus_. Otherwise, the preferred habitats of the two species  seem to be much the same.    In the investigation described here I attempted to evaluate various  types of habitats on the basis of their carrying capacity at different  stages of the annual cycle and in different years. The habitats were  studied and described in terms of yield, cover and species composition.  The areas upon which live-trapping was done were studied most  intensively.    These two areas, herein designated as House Field and Quarry Field, were  both occupied by voles throughout the period of study. Population  density varied considerably, however (Fig. 5). Both of these areas were  dominated by _Bromus inermis_, and, in clipped samples taken in June,  1951, this grass constituted 67 per cent of the vegetation on House  Field and 54 per cent of the vegetation on Quarry Field. Estimates made  at other times in 1950, 1951 and 1952 always confirmed the dominance of  smooth brome and approximated the above percentages. Parts of House  Field had nearly pure stands of this grass. Those traps set in spots  where there was little vegetation other than the dominant grass caught  fewer voles than traps set in spots with a more varied cover. _Poa  pratensis_ formed an understory over most of the area studied,  especially on House Field, and attained local dominance in shaded spots  on both fields. The higher basal cover provided by the _Poa_ understory  seemed to support a vole population larger than those that occurred in  areas lacking the bluegrass. Disturbed situations, such as roadsides,  were characterized by the dominance of _Bromus japonicus_. This grass  occurred also in low densities over much of the study area among _B.  inermis_. Other grasses present included _Triodia flava_, common in  House Field, but with only spotty distribution in Quarry Field; _Elymus  canadensis_, distributed over both areas in spotty fashion and almost  always showing evidence of use by voles and other small mammals;  _Aristida oligantha_ and _Bouteloua curtipendula_, both more common on  the higher and drier Quarry Field; _Panicum virgatum_, _Setaria_ spp.,  especially on disturbed areas; and three bluestems, _Andropogon  gerardi_, _A. virginicus_ and _A. scoparius_. The bluestems increased  noticeably during the study period (even though grasses in general were  being replaced by woody plants) and they furnished a preferred habitat  for voles because of their high yield of edible foliage and relatively  heavy debris which provided shelter.    On House Field the most common forbs were _Vernonia baldwini_, _Verbena  stricta_ and _Solanum carolinense_. On Quarry Field, _Solidago_ spp. and  _Asclepias_ spp. were also abundant. All of them seemed to be used by  the voles for food during the early stages of growth, when they were  tender and succulent. The fruits of the horse nettle (_Solanum  carolinense_) were also eaten. The forbs themselves did not provide  cover dense enough to constitute good vole habitat. Mixed in a grass  dominated association they nevertheless raised the carrying capacity  above that of a pure stand of grass. Other forbs noted often enough to  be considered common on both House Field and Quarry Field included  _Carex gravida_, observed frequently in House Field and less often in  Quarry Field; _Amorpha canescens_, more common in Quarry Field;  _Tradescantia bracteata_, _Capsella bursapastoris_, _Oxalis violacea_,  _Euphorbia marginata_, _Convolvulus arvensis_, _Lithospermum arvense_,  _Teucrium canadense_, _Physalis longifolia_, _Phytolacca americana_,  _Plantago major_, _Ambrosia trifida_, _A. artemisiifolia_, _Helianthus  annuus_, _Cirsium altissimum_ and _Taraxacum erythrospermum_. Both areas  were being invaded from one side by forest-edge vegetation; the woody  plants noted included _Prunus americana_, _Rubus argutus_,"]]]
