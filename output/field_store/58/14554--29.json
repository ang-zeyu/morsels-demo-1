In 1881,          she opened the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in          Boston, under the seal of the Commonwealth, a law  xi:30   relative to colleges having been passed, which enabled          her to get this institution chartered for medical pur-  xii:1   poses. No charters were granted to Christian Scien-          tists for such institutions after 1883, and up to that  xii:3   date, hers was the only College of this character which          had been established in the United States, where          Christian Science was first introduced.    xii:6   During seven years over four thousand students          were taught by the author in this College. Meanwhile          she was pastor of the first established Church of  xii:9   Christ, Scientist; President of the first Christian Sci-          entist Association, convening monthly; publisher of          her own works; and (for a portion of this time) sole  xii:12  editor and publisher of the Christian Science Journal,          the first periodical issued by Christian Scientists. She          closed her College, October 29, 1889, in the height of  xii:15  its prosperity with a deep-lying conviction that the          next two years of her life should be given to the prep-          aration of the revision of SCIENCE AND HEALTH, which  xii:18  was published in 1891. She retained her charter, and          as its President, reopened the College in 1899 as auxil-          iary to her church. Until June 10, 1907, she had never  xii:21  read this book throughout consecutively in order to elu-          cidate her idealism.            In the spirit of Christ's charity, as one who \"hopeth  xii:24  all things, endureth all things,\" and is joyful to bear          consolation to the sorrowing and healing to the sick,          she commits these pages to honest seekers for Truth.

CHAPTER I - PRAYER            For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this          mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and          shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those          things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have          whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things          soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them,          and ye shall have them.          Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask          Him. - CHRIST JESUS.    1:1     THE prayer that reforms the sinner and heals the          sick is an absolute faith that all things are  1:3     possible to God,- a spiritual understanding of Him,          an unselfed love. Regardless of what another may say          or think on this subject, I speak from experience.  1:6     Prayer, watching, and working, combined with self-im-          molation, are God's gracious means for accomplishing          whatever has been successfully done for the Christian-  1:9     ization and health of mankind.            Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine          Mind. Desire is prayer; and no loss can occur from  1:12    trusting God with our desires, that they may be          moulded and exalted before they take form in words          and in deeds.                                  Right motives    2:1     What are the motives for prayer? Do we pray to          make ourselves better or to benefit those who hear us,  2:3     to enlighten the infinite or to be heard of          men? Are we benefited by praying? Yes,          the desire which goes forth hungering after righteous-  2:6     ness is blessed of our Father, and it does not return          unto us void.                               Deity unchangeable            God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more  2:9     than He has already done, nor can the infinite do less          than bestow all good, since He is unchang-          ing wisdom and Love. We can do more for  2:12    ourselves by humble fervent petitions, but the All-lov-          ing does not grant them simply on the ground of lip-          service, for He already knows all.    2:15    Prayer cannot change the Science of being, but it          tends to bring us into harmony with it. Goodness at-          tains the demonstration of Truth. A request that  2:18    God will save us is not all that is required. The mere          habit of pleading with the divine Mind, as one pleads          with a human being, perpetuates the belief in God as  2:21    humanly circumscribed,- an error which impedes spirit-          ual growth.                                 God's standard            God is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is  2:24    intelligence. Can we inform the infinite Mind of any-          thing He does not already comprehend?          Do we expect to change perfection? Shall  2:27    we plead for more at the open fount, which is pour-          ing forth more than we accept? The unspoken desire          does bring us nearer the source of all existence and  2:30    blessedness.            Asking God to /be/ God is a vain repetition. God is          \"the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever;\" and  3:1     He who is immutably right will do right without being          reminded of His province. The wisdom of man is not  3:3     sufficient to warrant him in advising God.                            The spiritual mathematics            Who would stand before a blackboard, and pray the          principle of mathematics to solve the problem? The  3:6     rule is already established, and it is our          task to work out the solution. Shall we          ask the divine Principle of all goodness to do His own  3:9     work? His work is done, and we have only to avail          ourselves of God's rule in order to receive His bless-          ing, which enables us to work out our own salvation.    3:12    The Divine Being must be reflected by man, - else          man is not the image and likeness of the patient,          tender, and true, the One \"altogether lovely;\" but to  3:15    understand God is the work of eternity, and demands          absolute consecration of thought, energy, and desire.                              Prayerful ingratitude            How empty are our conceptions of Deity! We admit  3:18    theoretically that God is good, omnipotent, omni-          present, infinite, and then we try to give          information to this infinite Mind. We plead  3:21    for unmerited pardon and for a liberal outpouring of          benefactions. Are we really grateful for the good          already received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the  3:24    blessings we have, and thus be fitted to receive more.          Gratitude is much more than a verbal expression of          thanks. Action expresses more gratitude than speech.    3:27    If we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and Love, and          yet return thanks to God for all blessings, we are in-          sincere and incur the sharp censure our Master pro-  3:30    nounces on hypocrites. In such a case, the only          acceptable prayer is to put the finger on the lips and          remember our blessings. While the heart is far from  4:1     divine Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the ingrati-          tude of barren lives.                              Efficacious petitions    4:3     What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire          for growth in grace, expressed in patience, meekness,          love, and good deeds. To keep the com-  4:6     mandments of our Master and follow his          example, is our proper debt to him and the only          worthy evidence of our gratitude for all that he has  4:9     done. Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to          express loyal and heartfelt gratitude, since he has          said: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\"    4:12    The habitual struggle to be always good is unceas-          ing prayer. Its motives are made manifest in the          blessings they bring,- blessings which, even if not  4:15    acknowledged in audible words, attest our worthiness          to be partakers of Love.                             Watchfulness requisite            Simply asking that we may love God will never  4:18    make us love Him; but the longing to be better          and holier, expressed in daily watchful-          ness and in striving to assimilate more of  4:21    the divine character, will mould and fashion us          anew, until we awake in His likeness. We reach the          Science of Christianity through demonstration of the  4:24    divine nature; but in this wicked world goodness          will \"be evil spoken of,\" and patience must bring          experience.                               Veritable devotion    4:27    Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual          understanding, which regenerates; but silent prayer,          watchfulness, and devout obedience enable  4:30    us to follow Jesus' example. Long prayers,          superstition, and creeds clip the strong pinions of love,          and clothe religion in human forms. Whatever mate-  5:1     rializes worship hinders man's spiritual growth and keeps          him from demonstrating his power over error.                             Sorrow and reformation    5:3     Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform          and the very easiest step. The next and great step re-          quired by wisdom is the test of our sincerity,  5:6     - namely, reformation. To this end we are          placed under the stress of circumstances. Temptation          bids us repeat the offence, and woe comes in return for  5:9     what is done. So it will ever be, till we learn that there          is no discount in the law of justice and that we must pay          \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34582"],[0,"Mozart : The story of a little boy and his sister who gave concerts (#2)"],[1,".    11.
