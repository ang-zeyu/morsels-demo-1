We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus  Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.    2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not  for Adam's transgression.    3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be  saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.    4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel  are:--(1) Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) Repentance; (3) Baptism  by immersion for the remission of sins; (4) Laying on of Hands for the  Gift of the Holy Ghost.    5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by  the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach the  Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.    6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive  Church, viz.: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.    7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions,  healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.    8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is  translated correctly; We also believe the Book of Mormon to be the  word of God.    9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal,  and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things  pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the  restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this [the  American] continent; That Christ will reign personally upon the earth;  and, That the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal  glory.    11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the  dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege,  let them worship how, where or what they may.    12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and  magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.    13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous,  and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the  admonition of Paul. We believe all things, we hope all things, we have  endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If  there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy,  we seek after these things.--Joseph Smith.          LECTURES    ON    THE ARTICLES OF FAITH    OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.          LECTURE I.    INTRODUCTORY.      =1."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#2)"],[1,"that left me free to pursue my studies. I journeyed in Zamora, in  Vendhya, in Stygia, and among the haunted jungles of Khitai. I read the  iron-bound books of Skelos, and talked with unseen creatures in deep  wells, and faceless shapes in black reeking jungles. I obtained a  glimpse of your sarcophagus in the demon-haunted crypts below the black  giant-walled temple of Set in the hinterlands of Stygia, and I learned  of the arts that would bring back life to your shriveled corpse. From  moldering manuscripts I learned of the Heart of Ahriman. Then for a year  I sought its hiding-place, and at last I found it.'    'Then why trouble to bring me back to life?' demanded Xaltotun, with his  piercing gaze fixed on the priest. 'Why did you not employ the Heart to  further your own power?'    'Because no man today knows the secrets of the Heart,' answered Orastes.  'Not even in legends live the arts by which to loose its full powers. I  knew it could restore life; of its deeper secrets I am ignorant. I  merely used it to bring you back to life. It is the use of your  knowledge we seek. As for the Heart, you alone know its awful secrets.'    Xaltotun shook his head, staring broodingly into the flaming depths.    'My necromantic knowledge is greater than the sum of all the knowledge  of other men,' he said; 'yet I do not know the full power of the jewel.  I did not invoke it in the old days; I guarded it lest it be used  against me. At last it was stolen, and in the hands of a feathered  shaman of the barbarians it defeated all my mighty sorcery. Then it  vanished, and I was poisoned by the jealous priests of Stygia before I  could learn where it was hidden.'    'It was hidden in a cavern below the temple of Mitra, in Tarantia,' said  Orastes. 'By devious ways I discovered this, after I had located your  remains in Set's subterranean temple in Stygia.    'Zamorian thieves, partly protected by spells I learned from sources  better left unmentioned, stole your mummy-case from under the very  talons of those which guarded it in the dark, and by camel-caravan and  galley and ox-wagon it came at last to this city.    'Those same thieves--or rather those of them who still lived after their  frightful quest--stole the Heart of Ahriman from its haunted cavern  below the temple of Mitra, and all the skill of men and the spells of  sorcerers nearly failed. One man of them lived long enough to reach me  and give the jewel into my hands, before he died slavering and gibbering  of what he had seen in that accursed crypt. The thieves of Zamora are  the most faithful of men to their trust. Even with my conjurements, none  but they could have stolen the Heart from where it has lain in  demon-guarded darkness since the fall of Acheron, three thousand years  ago.'    Xaltotun lifted his lion-like head and stared far off into space, as if  plumbing the lost centuries.    'Three thousand years!' he muttered. 'Set! Tell me what has chanced in  the world.'    'The barbarians who overthrew Acheron set up new kingdoms,' quoted  Orastes. 'Where the empire had stretched now rose realms called  Aquilonia, and Nemedia, and Argos, from the tribes that founded them.  The older kingdoms of Ophir, Corinthia and western Koth, which had been  subject to the kings of Acheron, regained their independence with the  fall of the empire.'    'And what of the people of Acheron?' demanded Xaltotun. 'When I fled  into Stygia, Python was in ruins, and all the great, purple-towered  cities of Acheron fouled with blood and trampled by the sandals of the  barbarians.'    'In the hills small groups of folk still boast descent from Acheron,'  answered Orastes. 'For the rest, the tide of my barbarian ancestors  rolled over them and wiped them out. They--my ancestors--had suffered  much from the kings of Acheron.'    A grim and terrible smile curled the Pythonian's lips.    'Aye! Many a barbarian, both man and woman, died screaming on the altar  under this hand. I have seen their heads piled to make a pyramid in the  great square in Python when the kings returned from the west with their  spoils and naked captives.'    'Aye. And when the day of reckoning came, the sword was not spared. So  Acheron ceased to be, and purple-towered Python became a memory of  forgotten days. But the younger kingdoms rose on the imperial ruins and  waxed great. And now we have brought you back to aid us to rule these  kingdoms, which, if less strange and wonderful than Acheron of old, are  yet rich and powerful, well worth fighting for. Look!' Orastes unrolled  before the stranger a map drawn cunningly on vellum.    Xaltotun regarded it, and then shook his head, baffled.    'The very outlines of the land are changed. It is like some familiar  thing seen in a dream, fantastically distorted.'    'Howbeit,' answered Orastes, tracing with his forefinger, 'here is  Belverus, the capital of Nemedia, in which we now are. Here run the  boundaries of the land of Nemedia. To the south and southeast are Ophir  and Corinthia, to the east Brythunia, to the west Aquilonia.'    'It is the map of a world I do not know,' said Xaltotun softly, but  Orastes did not miss the lurid fire of hate that flickered in his dark  eyes.    'It is a map you shall help us change,' answered Orastes. 'It is our  desire first to set Tarascus on the throne of Nemedia. We wish to  accomplish this without strife, and in such a way that no suspicion will  rest on Tarascus. We do not wish the land to be torn by civil wars, but  to reserve all our power for the conquest of Aquilonia.    'Should King Nimed and his sons die naturally, in a plague for instance,  Tarascus would mount the throne as the next heir, peacefully and  unopposed.'    Xaltotun nodded, without replying, and Orastes continued.    'The other task will be more difficult. We cannot set Valerius on the  Aquilonian throne without a war, and that kingdom is a formidable foe.  Its people are a hardy, war-like race, toughened by continual wars with  the Picts, Zingarians and Cimmerians. For five hundred years Aquilonia  and Nemedia have intermittently waged war, and the ultimate advantage  has always lain with the Aquilonians.    'Their present king is the most renowned warrior among the western  nations. He is an outlander, an adventurer who seized the crown by force  during a time of civil strife, strangling King Namedides with his own  hands, upon the very throne. His name is Conan, and no man can stand  before him in battle.    'Valerius is now the rightful heir of the throne. He had been driven  into exile by his royal kinsman, Namedides, and has been away from his  native realm for years, but he is of the blood of the old dynasty, and  many of the barons would secretly hail the overthrow of Conan, who is a  nobody without royal or even noble blood. But the common people are  loyal to him, and the nobility of the outlying provinces. Yet if his  forces were overthrown in the battle that must first take place, and  Conan himself slain, I think it would not be difficult to put Valerius  on the throne. Indeed, with Conan slain, the only center of the  government would be gone. He is not part of a dynasty, but only a lone  adventurer.'    'I wish that I might see this king,' mused Xaltotun, glancing toward a  silvery mirror which formed one of the panels of the wall. This mirror  cast no reflection, but Xaltotun's expression showed that he understood  its purpose, and Orastes nodded with the pride a good craftsman takes in  the recognition of his accomplishments by a master of his craft.    'I will try to show him to you,' he said. And seating himself before the  mirror, he gazed hypnotically into its depths, where presently a dim  shadow began to take shape.    It was uncanny, but those watching knew it was no more than the  reflected image of Orastes' thought, embodied in that mirror as a  wizard's thoughts are embodied in a magic crystal. It floated hazily,  then leaped into startling clarity--a tall man, mightily shouldered and  deep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He  was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked  in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his  square-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more  natural to him than the regal accouterments. His brow was low and broad,  his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His  dark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his  velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his  limbs.    'That man is no Hyborian!' exclaimed Xaltotun.    'No; he is a Cimmerian, one of those wild tribesmen who dwell in the  gray hills of the north.'    'I fought his ancestors of old,' muttered Xaltotun. 'Not even the kings  of Acheron could conquer them.'    'They still remain a terror to the nations of the south,' answered  Orastes. 'He is a true son of that savage race, and has proved himself,  thus far, unconquerable.'    Xaltotun did not reply; he sat staring down at the pool of living fire  that shimmered in his hand. Outside, the hound howled again, long and  shudderingly.          2    A Black Wind Blows      The year of the dragon had birth in war and pestilence and unrest. The  black plague stalked through the streets of Belverus, striking down the  merchant in his stall, the serf in his kennel, the knight at his banquet  board. Before it the arts of the leeches were helpless. Men said it had  been sent from hell as punishment for the sins of pride and lust. It was  swift and deadly as the stroke of an adder. The victim's body turned  purple and then black, and within a few minutes he sank down dying, and  the stench of his own putrefaction was in his nostrils even before death  wrenched his soul from his rotting body. A hot, roaring wind blew  incessantly from the south, and the crops withered in the fields, the  cattle sank and died in their tracks.    Men"]]]
