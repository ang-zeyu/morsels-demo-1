There are considerable areas of flood-plain along the Galien River, and  except for the recently formed mud bars the flood-plains are heavily  covered with a mixed forest in which the linden, _Tilia americana_,  white elm, _Ulmus americana_, and sycamore, _Platanus occidentalis_, are  conspicuous species. Under this forest there are a few small trees, but  there is very little underbrush. The herbage also is sparse and, though  in a few places there is a considerable growth of ferns, grasses, and  sedges, and of other herbs, there are also many bare areas.    One of the significant features of the flood-plains, so far as the  mammals are concerned, is the flooding to which these areas are  subjected during the spring high-water. At that time the flood-plain for  a number of days or weeks may be covered with several feet of water.    During the period between July 29 and August 28 a total of one hundred  and seventy mouse traps set in the flood-plain forests along the  Galien River took for the first nights' trapping, twenty-two northern  white-footed mice and one house mouse. Short-tailed shrews, more  white-footed mice, pine voles, and a jumping mouse were secured on  nights after the first. Larger traps took during the whole period one  raccoon, one New York weasel, and two woodchucks. Several other  woodchucks and a number of red squirrels were seen. Ridges of moles  were numerous, but no specimens were secured. Tooth marks on an old,  partly fallen linden were probably made, perhaps a number of years  ago, by a porcupine.    Throughout the woods there are a number of small ravines. These  ravines are forested with trees mostly of the flood-plain type, and  there is evidence in many of the ravines, at least in their lower  parts, that flooding occurs in the ravine bottom during the spring.    Fifty mouse traps set August 26 in a large ravine north of the county  road took on the first day five northern white-footed mice and one  house mouse. Short-tailed shrews, more white-footed mice, and pine  voles were trapped on following days. Here also red squirrels and a  cottontail were seen, and tracks of raccoon noted. Evidently the fauna  is the same as that of the flood-plain, with which it is here included.      _Beech-maple forest habitat_:         _Blarina brevicauda talpoides._ Short-tailed shrew. 7.         _Procyon lotor lotor._ Raccoon. Tracks.         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 86.         _Microtus pinetorum scalopsoides._ Northern pine vole. 5.         _Zapus hudsonius hudsonius._ Hudson Bay jumping mouse. 1.         _Marmota monax monax._ Southern woodchuck. Burrows.         _Tamias striatus lysteri._ Northeastern chipmunk. 1.         _Sciurus hudsonicus loquax._ Southern red squirrel. 10.         _Sciurus niger rufiventer._ Fox squirrel. 7.         _Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii._ Mearns cottontail. 1.    The climax forest of the region is dominated by the beech, _Fagus  grandiflora_, and the sugar maple, _Acer saccharum_. The trees in this  forest are very large, so that the forest crown is high and the shade  dense. Only a few small trees occur and these are mostly young beeches  and young sugar maples. The underbrush varies much in height and  denseness; mostly it is quite open, so that one can easily walk  through the forest, but in a few places the growth is more dense.  Common members of the underbrush on the higher ground are the small  beeches, sugar maples, and the spice-bush, _Benzoin aestivale_; while  on the lower benches along the river seedlings of the paw-paw dominate  the undergrowth. The ground is heavily covered by decaying leaves and  a little dead brush and fallen branches, but nearly all the logs have  been removed. Early in the spring a thick growth of herbs covers the  ground, but by July the herbs are mostly gone, only a few remaining,  and there are many small bare areas covered only by leaves. The soil  under this forest seems to be mainly clay; in spring or after heavy  rains pools of water are formed, and these remain for a long time.    Between July 21 and August 27 a total of two hundred and eighty-five  mouse traps set in the upland forest took on the first nights one  short-tailed shrew and thirty northern white-footed mice. In addition  to these species pine voles and a jumping mouse were trapped on days  after the first. One shrew was caught alive August 30, as he was  running about on the forest floor at 7:30 A.M. A few tracks of raccoon  were seen from time to time on the road leading through the woods. A  few fresh burrows of woodchucks were noted at the edges of benches and  of ravines. A few red squirrels were seen at different times and two  collected. Fox squirrels were rare, being noted only a few times; Mr.  Norman A. Wood also saw these squirrels on two occasions in May. One  cottontail was shot, in the climax forest. Mr. Wood collected a  chipmunk in the climax forest on May 15, 1918, and saw another in the  same habitat in May, 1919.      _Aerial habitat_:    Bats were seen on a few evenings, flying about over the climax forest,  and over the adjacent region, but they were extremely rare, and  efforts to shoot a specimen failed.          MODIFIED AND ARTIFICIAL HABITATS      _Second-growth forest and scrub habitat_:         _Mustela noveboracensis noveboracensis._ New York weasel. 1.         _Mephitis nigra._ Eastern skunk. 1.         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 5.         _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 4.         _Mus musculus musculus._ House mouse. 1.         _Marmota monax monax._ Southern woodchuck. 1.         _Sciurus hudsonicus loquax._ Southern red squirrel. 1.         _Sylvilagus floridanus mearnsii._ Mearns cottontail. 5.    Small trees and brush have grown up along the edges of many of the  ravines in the cleared fields in and surrounding the preserve. Many of  the trees are oaks, but beech and hard maple also occur, a few of them  being relics from the original forest. Considerable brush is present,  formed by a large variety of species. A few other small patches,  especially in ravine bottoms and on flood-plains have been allowed to  grow up to brush and small trees. In nearly every case these areas are  heavily pastured.    The conditions here included in the second-growth forest and scrub  habitat are not homogeneous, but differ in each different location  where the habitat is found, tree and shrub species abundant in one  situation not being present in another. The habitat is usually narrow  in extent, being often confined to the width of the steep ravine wall.    Owing to its poor development and uncertain characteristics no  intensive trapping was done in this type of habitat. A weasel was  trapped in open beech-maple-oak forest at the edge of a cleared  ravine, and a woodchuck was shot in the same type of habitat. Another  woodchuck and a skunk were trapped at different times in low willow  brush on the banks of the river just north of the woods. Northern  white-footed mice, Pennsylvania voles, and a house mouse were trapped  in thick oak brush and trees alongside a road north of the woods. A  red squirrel was shot in second-growth oak and aspen woods in the  north part of the preserve, and they were seen in open woods along  ravines. Cottontails were noted a few times in blackberry thickets,  in brush in ravines, in clearings along the river, and in  beech-maple-oak forest along ravines.      _Cleared-ravine sedge habitat_:         _Blarina brevicauda talpoides._ Short-tailed shrew. 1.         _Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis._ Northern white-footed       mouse. 3.         _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 5.    A large ravine south of the river had been cleared of trees evidently  several years previously, and it has now grown up mostly to sedges,  grass, and iris in its more moist parts. Along the little brook which  flows through the ravine there is a fringe of willows, and among the  sedges a number of shrubs and small trees occur, mostly thorns and a  few young sycamores and black walnuts.    Fifty mouse traps set in this habitat took on the first day, August  16, three northern white-footed mice and three Pennsylvania voles.  More voles and a short-tailed shrew were taken on later days.      _Cleared-upland rush habitat_:         _Mephitis nigra._ Eastern skunk. Den.         _Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii._ Prairie white-footed mouse. 1.         _Synaptomys cooperi._ Cooper lemming-vole. 1.         _Microtus pennsylvanicus pennsylvanicus._ Pennsylvania vole. 7.         _Microtus ochrogaster._ Prairie vole. 1.         _Citellus tridecemlineatus tridecemlineatus._ Thirteen-striped       ground squirrel. 2.    In the shallow, poorly drained depressions of the cleared upland the  vegetation is dominated by rushes, which grow in clumps and form a  thick growth, reaching a height of about one meter as a maximum. At  the edges of the habitat and in places not thickly covered by the  rushes a growth of sedges, grasses, and moss covers the ground; but  under the thickest growth of rushes the ground is bare and is  evidently covered by water during a part of the year. On this upland  one small pond surrounded by rushes did not dry up until late in  August. In a few places small blackberry thickets occur in the areas  of rushes and dominate all other plants.    Fifty traps set in this habitat, on August 8, took on the first night  one prairie white-footed mouse and one Pennsylvania vole; the prairie  white-footed mouse was taken just at the edge of the growth of rushes.  Other Pennsylvania voles as well as a lemming-vole, a prairie vole,  and several young ground squirrels were secured on later nights by the  same trap-line. A skunk den was situated in a blackberry thicket in  "]]]
