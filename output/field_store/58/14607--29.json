In size and strength the bull moose is probably the equal of any antlered  animal that ever lived, one having been shot in Maine with a spread of over  six feet. He sheds these splendid antlers every winter, generally in  January. They are found sometimes by woodsmen, but usually are gnawed and  eaten up by small animals as soon as dropped, as they have a salty flavor  that makes them palatable to squirrels, sable, and the like.    Owing to the color of his coat, it is hard to detect a moose sometimes in  \"black growth,\" that is, spruce or hemlock, for his upper part is brownish  black, and his legs tone off into gray or yellowish white. The shanks are  esteemed by residents of the woods country for making boots or \"shoepacks,\"  the hair being left on and turned outward. Such foot covering lasts  indefinitely and sheds water perfectly. The hoof is peculiarly flexible,  and divided farther, for example, than in the case of the ox. This enables  him to walk easily on slippery surfaces, and through bogs, by spreading the  hoofs. It is said that he can pass through a swamp where a man would become  foundered, while the speed with which he passes over moss-grown boulders,  or masses of blown-down trees, is remarkable.    It is most discouraging, after tracking your game for hours at a time, to  finally have to give it up on account of darkness setting in. Lighting your  pipe, you retrace your steps to camp and await the coming of the morrow,  when the routine of the previous day is gone over. It is the quiet, careful  man who succeeds in tracking, as the breaking of a twig or the brushing of  one's coat against a tree will jump your game, and in his fright he travels  many miles before stopping.    He is an exceptionally keen-scented animal, and mark you well as to the  general direction of the wind before leaving camp, as to work along with it  is fatal. Miles before you have seen him he smells you and immediately  increases the distance from his would-be foe.    [Illustration: TWIN MOOSE CALVES, THREE DAYS OLD.    (Taken at the Headwaters of the Liverpool River, Nova Scotia.)    Photographed from Life.]    When the rutting season is at its height, along about the first of October,  and the days warm, another method of moose-hunting is brought into  play,--that of imitating the call of the cow with a birch horn about  eighteen inches in length. There are many expert moose-callers in Maine and  the Canadian Provinces, though they have by no means a monopoly of this  accomplishment. The sound is most peculiar, and can only be acquired by  long practice. The most expert callers are those who have taken lessons  from nature,--that is, have been close to a female moose when she was  calling the male. At least one in three of the Maine guides can call  moose. With his birch horn, and seated beside some lake on a quiet evening,  he sends back into the forest or across some shallow logan the weird  \"woo-oo-oo, woo-woo-oo\" of the cow moose calling the bull. If there be a  bull within hearing he will respond with a deep grunt. He will then tear  along through the woods in the direction of the call, and perhaps splash  out with a great noise into the shallow water where he expects to find a  mate answering his amorous advances.    Ordinarily the moose is a silent animal, being very careful not to make a  noise. Old guides have said that in spite of his great spread of horns he  will pass quietly through a thick growth. Generally, if seen in summer at  the edge of a lake or stream, he slips noiselessly into the woods, but when  the rutting season begins he casts his discretion to the winds and responds  to the call of the cow with noisy disregard of consequences. He is also  quarrelsome at such times, and should another bull happen to trespass on  what he considers his territory there may be trouble. The rutting season is  generally over by the first week in October, and the bulls will not answer  the calls after that, unless the weather should hold very warm. Most guides  claim that during the rutting season the bulls have a wide range, but that  the cows remain in one neighborhood.    While yarded moose are very methodical in their habits: they have,  however, a single eye to one object, the detection of any intruder,  therefore it is only by a knowledge of their habits that they can be  approached by the hunter. It is their keen sense of hearing and smell that  are to be guarded against, for as a rule, when the animal can see the  hunter, he can also see the moose, and his capture becomes simply a  question of marksmanship. It is certainly a unique sport and has few  successful aspirants.    Of the two, still hunting is usually the more successful and the greater  number of moose are secured in that way. In the late fall, the coming of  the first snow doubles one's chances of success as every step of the animal  is shown. In tracking he usually goes through the worst places possible for  him to find, which adds to one's discomfort and lessens one's chances of a  shot.    [Illustration: BULL MOOSE SWIMMING MUSQUOCOOK LAKE.    (St. John Waters.)    Photographed from Life.]    Nature has bestowed upon him methods of passing through underbrush or  blowdowns silently where a man in following makes a noise ten times as  loud. The very silence of the forest is noisy. The wind whistling through  the tree-tops, the bushes grating against one another, both contribute to  make noise.    Those of my readers who have heard the low, weird grunt of the bull moose,  and have listened to the music of the crashing of the underbrush as he  forces his way through in answer to the melancholy and drawn-out bellow of  the cow, will understand full well when I say that it cannot be described,  but must be heard to be appreciated, and is certainly worth all the  hardships it entails to be listened to only once.    I remember well of a time that my guide called from the edge of a lake at  sunset, and received an answer from a large bull on a mountain a mile or  two away, where we could hear him coming nearer and nearer as the moments  wore on. After a half hour had elapsed he had reached the other side of the  lake, and was so close that we did not dare to repeat the call for fear he  would detect the artificial from the natural. He did not venture nearer,  and as it was too dark to see him across the lake, we returned to camp, but  that fifteen minutes will live long in my memory.    To hunt moose successfully one must \"rough it,\" and sleep without a fire,  as the best time to hunt is at sunset and daylight, and with their keen  sight and scent a fire means no moose.    In his visits to the Maine woods half a century ago, Thoreau made copious  notes about the moose, which was then slaughtered indiscriminately, by  Indians and others, for their hides. This slaughter, which could not be  called hunting, shocked the gentle naturalist from Concord, who made the  prediction that \"the moose will, perhaps, some day become extinct, and  exist only as a fossil relic.\" This may be true, but the animal has  judicial friends, and so long as they protect him, it does not appear as if  the moose could become extinct from slaughter. Indeed, it is claimed that  as many if not more moose are to be found now than fifty years ago.    [Illustration: LARGE BULL MOOSE ON MUD POND BROOK.    (West Branch Waters.)    Photographed from Life. Time exposure.]          CHAPTER II.         THE PROVINCIAL MOOSE. A BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY. LUCK AND       ILL-LUCK. THE JUDGE AND THE BANKER.      One of the greatest moose regions in the world is that portion of land  drained by the tributaries of the St. John, Miramichi, and Restigouche  rivers. It is true that portions of Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Labrador are  roamed over by herds of these magnificent animals, but the best specimens  of the race are found within the compass of Eastern New Brunswick.    It is a country of hill and dale, cedar swamps, hardwood ridges, and  barrens, where the blueberry, the hackmatack, and here and there stunted  tamaracks break the general sweep of waste country. Along these barrens the  moose loves to roam. Here he finds the moss of which he is so fond, and  here, too, he gets the young shoots of various shrubs on which he feeds. He  can also keep a weather eye on the approach of danger, and as he feeds, he  occasionally throws his massive head in the air, and takes a sudden and  piercing glance around the landscape. If satisfied, he gives a short grunt  of evident pleasure and proceeds with his feeding.    The best horns are secured in the months of late October, November, and  early December. In January the horn begins to get soft, and soon falls off.  It is said by hunters that the largest animals lose their antlers weeks  earlier than the younger bulls. It is also claimed that the natural color  of the moose-horn is white; that this is the color when the velvet comes  off, but that contact with the trees, and rubbing against the  bark--something which the moose apparently delights in--causes the horn to  take that pretty shade of antique oak. There is all the difference in the  world in horns. Some have a multitude of points; some have wider webs; some  have stouter horn stems; some set more gracefully on the skull; some lie  more horizontally than others; so that when the term a \"choice head\" is  used it means that nature has given the bull all the beauty of antlers in  profusion.    With far greater agility and cunning than any other animal of its weight,  the moose is a formidable opponent when attacked. Some narrow escapes have  been made by hunters using the old cap gun, but now with the breech-loader  the speed that guarantees security is given.    I have seen a great curiosity in the form of the horns of two moose  inextricably interlocked. The story these horns tell is that a duel to the  death had taken place in a forest glade between a bull"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#2)"],[1,"heat warped it one way, the masses of autumn rain warped it  another. Put a chair against it. Lock the last door and hide the key.  Sling the knapsack on one's back, take the kitchenino in one's hand and  look round. The dawn-red widening, between the purpling sea and the  troubled sky. A light in the capucin convent across there. Cocks crowing  and the long, howling, hiccuping, melancholy bray of an ass. \"All  females are dead, all females--och! och! och!--hoooo! Ahaa!--there's one  left.\" So he ends on a moaning grunt of consolation. This is what the  Arabs tell us an ass is howling when he brays.           *       *       *       *       *    Very dark under the great carob tree as we go down the steps. Dark still  the garden. Scent of mimosa, and then of jasmine. The lovely mimosa tree  invisible. Dark the stony path. The goat whinnies out of her shed. The  broken Roman tomb which lolls right over the garden track does not fall  on me as I slip under its massive tilt. Ah, dark garden, dark garden,  with your olives and your wine, your medlars and mulberries and many  almond trees, your steep terraces ledged high up above the sea, I am  leaving you, slinking out. Out between the rosemary hedges, out of the  tall gate, on to the cruel steep stony road. So under the dark, big  eucalyptus trees, over the stream, and up towards the village. There, I  have got so far.           *       *       *       *       *    It is full dawn--dawn, not morning, the sun will not have risen. The  village is nearly all dark in the red light, and asleep still. No one  at the fountain by the capucin gate: too dark still. One man leading a  horse round the corner of the Palazzo Corvaia. One or two dark men along  the Corso. And so over the brow, down the steep cobble-stone street  between the houses, and out to the naked hill front. This is the  dawn-coast of Sicily. Nay, the dawn-coast of Europe. Steep, like a vast  cliff, dawn-forward. A red dawn, with mingled curdling dark clouds, and  some gold. It must be seven o'clock. The station down below, by the sea.  And noise of a train. Yes, a train. And we still high on the steep  track, winding downwards. But it is the train from Messina to Catania,  half an hour before ours, which is from Catania to Messina.           *       *       *       *       *    So jolt, and drop, and jolt down the old road that winds on the cliff  face. Etna across there is smothered quite low, quite low in a dense  puther of ink-black clouds. Playing some devilry in private, no doubt.  The dawn is angry red, and yellow above, the sea takes strange colors. I  hate the station, pigmy, drawn out there beside the sea. On this steep  face, especially in the windless nooks, the almond blossom is already  out. In little puffs and specks and stars, it looks very like bits of  snow scattered by winter. Bits of snow, bits of blossom, fourth day of  the year 1921. Only blossom. And Etna indescribably cloaked and  secretive in her dense black clouds. She has wrapped them quite round  her, quite low round her skirts.           *       *       *       *       *    At last we are down. We pass the pits where men are burning  lime--red-hot, round pits--and are out on the high-way. Nothing can be  more depressing than an Italian high-road. From Syracuse to Airolo it is  the same: horrible, dreary, slummy high-roads the moment you approach a  village or any human habitation. Here there is an acrid smell of lemon  juice. There is a factory for making citrate. The houses flush on the  road, under the great lime-stone face of the hill, open their slummy  doors, and throw out dirty water and coffee dregs. We walk over the  dirty water and coffee dregs. Mules rattle past with carts. Other people  are going to the station. We pass the Dazio and are there.           *       *       *       *       *    Humanity is, externally, too much alike. Internally there are  insuperable differences. So one sits and thinks, watching the people on  the station: like a line of caricatures between oneself and the naked  sea and the uneasy, clouding dawn.    You would look in vain this morning for the swarthy feline southerner of  romance. It might, as far as features are concerned, be an early morning  crowd waiting for the train on a north London suburb station. As far as  features go. For some are fair and some colorless and none racially  typical. The only one that is absolutely like a race caricature is a  tall stout elderly fellow with spectacles and a short nose and a  bristling moustache, and he is the German of the comic papers of twenty  years ago. But he is pure Sicilian.    They are mostly young fellows going up the line to Messina to their job:  not artizans, lower middle class. And externally, so like any other  clerks and shop-men, only rather more shabby, much less _socially_  self-conscious. They are lively, they throw their arms round one  another's necks, they all but kiss. One poor chap has had earache, so a  black kerchief is tied round his face, and his black hat is perched  above, and a comic sight he looks. No one seems to think so, however.  Yet they view my arrival with a knapsack on my back with cold  disapprobation, as unseemly as if I had arrived riding on a pig. I ought  to be in a carriage, and the knapsack ought to be a new suit-case. I  know it, but am inflexible.    That is how they are. Each one thinks he is as handsome as Adonis, and  as \"fetching\" as Don Juan. Extraordinary! At the same time, all flesh is  grass, and if a few trouser-buttons are missing or if a black hat  perches above a thick black face-muffle and a long excruciated face, it  is all in the course of nature. They seize the black-edged one by the  arm, and in profound commiseration: \"Do you suffer? Are you suffering?\"  they ask.    And that also is how they are. So terribly physically all over one  another. They pour themselves one over the other like so much melted  butter over parsnips. They catch each other under the chin, with a  tender caress of the hand, and they smile with sunny melting tenderness  into each other's face. Never in the world have I seen such melting gay  tenderness as between casual Sicilians on railway platforms, whether  they be young lean-cheeked Sicilians or huge stout Sicilians.    There must be something curious about the proximity of a volcano. Naples  and Catania alike, the men are hugely fat, with great macaroni paunches,  they are expansive and in a perfect drip of casual affection and love.  But the Sicilians are even more wildly exuberant and fat and all over  one another than the Neapolitans. They never leave off being amorously  friendly with almost everybody, emitting a relentless physical  familiarity that is quite bewildering to one not brought up near a  volcano.    This is more true of the middle classes than of the lower. The working  men are perforce thinner and less exuberant. But they hang together in  clusters, and can never be physically near enough.           *       *       *       *       *    It is only thirty miles to Messina, but the train takes two hours. It  winds and hurries and stops beside the lavender grey morning sea. A  flock of goats trail over the beach near the lapping wave's edge,  dismally. Great wide deserts of stony river-beds run down to the sea,  and men on asses are picking their way across, and women are kneeling by  the small stream-channel washing clothes. The lemons hang pale and  innumerable in the thick lemon groves. Lemon trees, like Italians, seem  to be happiest when they are touching one another all round. Solid  forests of not very tall lemon trees lie between the steep mountains and  the sea, on the strip of plain. Women, vague in the orchard  under-shadow, are picking the lemons, lurking as if in the undersea.  There are heaps of pale yellow lemons under the trees. They look like  pale, primrose-smouldering fires. Curious how like fires the heaps of  lemons look, under the shadow of foliage, seeming to give off a pallid  burning amid the suave, naked, greenish trunks. When there comes a  cluster of orange trees, the oranges are red like coals among the darker  leaves. But lemons, lemons, innumerable, speckled like innumerable tiny  stars in the green firmament of leaves. So many lemons! Think of all  the lemonade crystals they will be reduced to! Think of America drinking  them up next summer.           *       *       *       *       *    I always wonder why such vast wide river-beds of pale boulders come out  of the heart of the high-rearing, dramatic stone mountains, a few miles  to the sea. A few miles only: and never more than a few threading  water-trickles in river-beds wide enough for the Rhine. But that is how  it is. The landscape is ancient, and classic--romantic, as if it had  known far-off days and fiercer rivers and more verdure. Steep, craggy,  wild, the land goes up to its points and precipices, a tangle of  heights. But all jammed on top of one another. And in old landscapes, as  in old people, the flesh wears away, and the bones become prominent.  Rock sticks up fantastically. The jungle of peaks in this old Sicily.           *       *       *       *       *    The sky is all grey. The Straits are grey. Reggio, just across the  water, is white looking, under the great dark toe of Calabria, the toe  of Italy. On Aspromonte there is grey cloud. It is going to rain. After  such marvelous ringing blue days, it is going to rain. What luck!           *       *       *       *       *    Aspromonte! Garibaldi! I could always cover my face when I see it,  Aspromonte. I wish Garibaldi had been prouder. Why did he go off so  humbly, with his bag of seed-corn and a flea in his ear, when His  Majesty King Victor Emmanuel arrived with his little short legs on the  scene. Poor Garibaldi! He wanted to be a hero and a dictator of free  Sicily. Well, one can't be a dictator and humble at the same time. One  must be a hero, which he was, and proud,"]]]
