The  collector was Sir Julius Caesar, of England, and this exquisite and unique  collection is in the British Museum. The books were all printed between  1591 and 1616.    Southey brought together fourteen thousand volumes, the most valuable  collection which had up to that time been acquired by any man whose means  and estate lay, as he once said of himself, in his inkstand. Time fails me  to speak of Erasmus, De Thou, Grotius, Goethe, Bodley; Hans Sloane, whose  private library of fifty thousand volumes was the beginning of that of the  British Museum; the Cardinal Borromeo, who founded the Ambrosian Library  at Milan with his own forty thousand volumes, and the other great names  entitled to the description of Bibliomaniac. We must not forget Sir  Richard Whittington, of feline fame, who gave 400 pounds to found the  library of Christ's Hospital, London.    The fair sex, good and bad, have been lovers of books or founders of  libraries; witness the distinguished names of Lady Jane Gray, Catherine De  Medicis, and Diane de Poictiers.    It only remains to speak of the great opium-eater, who was a sort of  literary ghoul, famed for borrowing books and never returning them, and  whose library was thus made up of the enforced contributions of  friends--for who would have dared refuse the loan of a book to Thomas de  Quincey? The name of the unhappy man would have descended to us with that  of the incendiary of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus. But the great Thomas  was recklessly careless and slovenly in his use of books; and Burton, in  the \"Book-hunter,\" tells us that \"he once gave in copy written on the  edges of a tall octavo 'Somnium Scipionis,' and as he did not obliterate  the original matter, the printer was rather puzzled, and made a funny  jumble between the letter-press Latin and the manuscript English.\" I  seriously fear that with him must be ranked the gentle Elia, who said: \"A  book reads the better which is our own, and has been so long known to us  that we know the topography of its blots and dog's ears, and can trace the  dirt in it to having read it at tea with buttered muffins, or over a pipe,  which I think is the maximum.\" And yet a great degree of slovenliness may  be excused in Charles because, according to Leigh Hunt, he once gave a  kiss to an old folio Chapman's \"Homer,\" and when asked how he knew his  books one from the other, for hardly any were lettered, he answered: \"How  does a shepherd know his sheep?\"    The love of books displayed by the sensual Henry and the pugnacious Junot  is not more remarkable than that of the epicurean and sumptuous Lucullus,  to whom Pompey, when sick, having been directed by his physician to eat a  thrush for dinner, and learning from his servants that in summer-time  thrushes were not to be found anywhere but in Lucullus' fattening coops,  refused to be indebted for his meal, observing: \"So if Lucullus had not  been an epicure, Pompey had not lived.\" Of him the veracious Plutarch  says: \"His furnishing a library, however, deserved praise and record, for  he collected very many and choice manuscripts; and the use they were put  to was even more magnificent than the purchase, the library being always  open, and the walks and reading rooms about it free to all Greeks, whose  delight it was to leave their other occupations and hasten thither as to  the habitation of the Muses.\"    It is not recorded that Socrates collected books--his wife probably  objected--but we have his word for it that he loved them. He did not love  the country, and the only thing that could tempt him thither was a book.  Acknowledging this to Phaedrus he says:    \"Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse me when you  hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge, and the men who  dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees or the country.  Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell with which to draw  me out of the city into the country, like a hungry cow before whom a bough  or a bunch of fruit is waved. For only hold up before me in like manner a  book, and you may lead me all round Attica, and over the wide world. And  now having arrived, I intend to lie down, and do you choose any posture in  which you can read best.\"          III.    DIVERSE TASTES.      It is fortunate for the harmony of book-collectors that they do not all  desire the same thing, just as it was fortunate for their young State that  all the Romans did not want the same Sabine woman. Otherwise the Helenic  battle of the books would be fiercer than it is. Thus there are  bibliomaniacs who reprint rare books from their own libraries in limited  numbers; authors, like Walpole, who print their own works, and whose fame  as printers is better deserved than their reputation as writers; like  Thackeray, who design the illustrations for their own romances, or, like  Astor, who procure a single copy of their novel to be illustrated at  lavish expense by artists; amateurs who bind their own books; lunatics who  yearn for books wholly engraved, or printed only on one side of the leaf,  or Greek books wholly in capitals, or others in the italic letter; or  black-letter fanciers; or tall copy men; or rubricists, missal men, or  first edition men, or incunabulists.    One seeks only ancient books; another limited editions; another those  privately printed; a fourth wants nothing but presentation copies; yet  another only those that have belonged to famous men, and still another  illustrated or illuminated books. There is a perfectly rabid and incurable  class, of whom the most harmless are devoted to pamphlets; another,  rather more dangerous, to incorrect or suppressed editions; and a third,  stark mad, to play-bills and portraits. One patronizes the drama, one  poetry, one the fine arts, another books about books and their collectors;  and a very recherche class devote themselves to works on playing-cards,  angling, magic, or chess, emblems, dances of death, or the jest books and  facetiae. Finally, there are those unhappy beings who run up and down for  duplicates, searching for every edition of their favorite authors. In very  recent days there has arisen a large class who demand the first editions  of popular novelists like Dickens, Thackeray and Hawthorne, and will pay  large prices for these issues which have no value except that of rarity. I  can quite understand the enthusiasm of the collector over the beautiful  first editions of the Greek and Latin classics, or for the first \"Paradise  Lost,\" or even for the ugly first folio \"Shakespeare,\" and why he should  prefer the comparatively rude first Walton's Angler to Pickering's  edition, the handsomest of this century, with its monumental title page.  But why a first edition of a popular novel should be more desirable than a  late one, which is usually the more elegant, I confess I cannot  understand. It is one of those things which, like the mystery of religion,  we must take on trust. So when a bookseller tells me that a copy of the  first issue of \"The Scarlet Letter\" has sold for seventy-five dollars,  and that a copy of the second, with the same date, but put out six months  later, is worth only seventy-five cents, I open my eyes but not my purse,  especially when I consider that the second is greatly superior to the  first on account of its famous preface of apology, and when I read of some  one's bidding $1875 for a copy of Poe's worthless \"Tamerlane,\" I am  flattered by the reflection that there is one man in the world whom I  believe to be eighteen hundred and seventy-five times as great a fool as I  am!          IV.    THE SIZE OF BOOKS.      Were I a despotic ruler of the universe I would make it a serious offense  to publish a book larger than royal octavo. Books should be made to read,  or at all events to look at, and in this view comfort and ease should be  consulted. Any one who has ever undertaken to read a huge quarto or folio  will sympathize with this view. The older and lazier the Book-Worm grows  the more he longs for little books, which he can hold in one hand without  getting a cramp, or at least support with arms in an elbow chair without  fatigue. Darwin remorselessly split big books in two. Mr. Slater says in  \"Book Collecting:\" \"When the library at Sion College took fire the  attendants, at the risk of their lives, rescued a pile of books from the  flames, and it is said that the librarian wept when he found that the  porters had taken it for granted that the value of a book was in exact  proportion to its size.\" Few of us, I suspect, ever read our family Bible,  and all of us probably groan when we lift out the unabridged dictionary.  The \"Century Dictionary\" is a luxury because it is published in small and  convenient parts. I cannot conceive any good in a big book except that the  ladies may use it to press flowers or mosses in, or the nurses may put it  in a chair to sit the baby on at table. I have heard of a gentleman who  inherited a mass of folio volumes and arranged them as shelves for his  smaller treasures, and of another who arranged his 12-mos on a stand made  up of the seventeen volumes of Pinkerton's \"Voyages\" and Denon's \"Egypt\"  for shelves. What reader would not prefer a dainty little Elzevir to the  huge folio, Caesar's \"Commentaries,\" even with the big bull in it, and the  wicker idol full of burning human victims? What can be more pleasing than  the modern Quantin edition of the classics? Or, to speak of a popular  book, take the \"Pastels in Prose,\" the most exquisite book for the price  ever known in the history of printing. The small book ought however to  be easily legible. The health and comfort of the human eye should be  consulted in the size of the type. Nothing can be worse in this regard  than the Pickering diamond classics, if meant to be read; and it seems  that there are too many of them to be intended"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#2)"],[1," here  declare, without wishing to reflect on brother sportsmen whose methods  are more Cromwellian, that when victorious in the war with a badger,  when, after many a hard-fought battle in his subterranean  fortress--when mine and counter-mine, tunnel, shaft, and trench have  driven him fighting to his last stand in his deepest and innermost  citadel, and he has been forced to capitulate--I have never abandoned  him to a victorious soldiery howling for blood, but have always given  him honourable terms. I have never willingly or wantonly killed a  badger; he has invariably become a pampered prisoner, or been  transported to some new home, where some one whom I had interested in  his species was prepared to give him protection, and a new start in  life. Among those who have given my badgers protection I may name Mr.  Edward North Buxton, who has done so much to maintain the natural beauty  of Epping Forest, and to protect wild life within its borders. I know of  several thriving colonies of badgers within the forest precincts  descended from my prisoners of war.    I have kept many badgers in confinement, but never to \"try\" my dogs, and  all my terriers learnt their trade in legitimate fashion. Badger-baiting  I unreservedly condemn--it is as much a profanation of sport as  coursing bagged hares in enclosed grounds. There are degrees of  wickedness, and when a badger is placed in a properly-constructed  badger-box there are few terriers that would not be vanquished in the  encounter. The figure below illustrates the correct box.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    One of the atrocious methods by which the badger was baited in the last  century is described and denounced in volume xii. of the _Sporting  Magazine_, 1788. \"They dig a place in the earth about a yard long, so  that one end is four feet deep. At this end a strong stake is driven  down. Then the badger's tail is split, a chain put through it, and  fastened to the stake with such ability that the badger can come up to  the other end of the place. The dogs are brought and set upon the poor  animal, who sometimes destroys several dogs before it is killed.\"    Badger-baiting, it seems, was the price the race had to pay for its  existence, and with the happy disuse of a brutal sport the harmless  badger has been doomed to extinction. The only method by which any  British wild animal can be preserved from extinction in this age of what  is termed progress, is to hunt it. Who can doubt, that if fox-hunting  and otter-hunting were stopped to-day, both these creatures would be  extinct within the next few years? It may be a hard bargain to make with  them, but considering their own crimes of violence, and their  incompatibility with \"civilization,\" it does not seem to be a too severe  condition to impose on the fox and the otter, that if they are permitted  to live they must at least submit to the risks and fortunes of the  chase. Not being able to do more than speculate on the intellectual and  nervous capacity of animals, we are apt to assign to them some measure  of human powers of thought and feeling. Undoubtedly they are physically  less sensitive, and we probably err when we ascribe to them more than a  slight ability to anticipate, or credit them with such sentiments as  anxiety, mental distress, and those thoughts and sensations that in the  main make pain intolerable. Those species that have long been associated  with man have, I think, a greater capacity for suffering. The  individuality of each domestic race has been developed; the difference  of temperament and character of each individual becomes more marked, and  more or less humanized, according to the influences by which it is  surrounded. There is a more uniform character and greater similarity of  temperament among wild animals, and the more refined the civilization  and the more cultivated the senses, the more sensitive will the whole  animal become. This may be seen in the most common of Nature's  operations. The wild beast produces its young with ease and without  pain. With woman, raised amidst the refinements of civilization, the  same operation is with every precaution and assistance sometimes a  dangerous, always an agonizing ordeal.    No, the terms are not hard. Take the case of a fox, the most hunted of  animals. The ordinary lot of a fox compared with that of any other  creature, wild or domestic, or even with man himself, is not an  unenviable one. Unlike the domestic animals, he is not born into  servitude or to die in early life by the butcher's knife or axe. Happier  than man, he lives his life, whether longer or shorter, free from the  worries, cares, and the thousand ills which flesh is heir to. The fox's  life is free as air. Protected for the most part from the natural  consequences of his marauding disposition, fair play is given to him to  avoid the punishment he deserves by the exercise of that strategy,  activity, and endurance with which he is so abundantly endowed. Two or  three days in the three hundred and sixty-five he may have to exert  himself more or less to save his brush, or the end may come swiftly and  suddenly after a long run; but even so, are there not many of us who  would be glad to know that our death would come as swiftly and  painlessly to us as to the fox, who, flying for forty minutes before the  pack, confident, perhaps, to the last that he is a match for his  pursuers, is rolled over in his stride? The sportsman may pity the  sinking fox, with every desire to see the victory of the straining pack,  in the moment when, after gallantly standing up before hounds, a  straight-necked veteran finds he has shot his last bolt, and turns with  fire yet in his eye to meet death in its swiftest form.    There is something strange in the mixture of pain with pleasure. My  little son comes out cub-hunting with me in the early morning of a  September day. He is the picture of delight, sitting on his pony among  the hounds, the effigy of enjoyment as he follows them with his and his  pony's head just above the high bracken, the incarnation of satisfaction  as he receives his first brush and is blooded. He is none the less a  little sportsman for sobbing himself to sleep at night with his brush  hugged under the bedclothes, because of the thought that the bright  little cubs he saw killed will never again run in and out of the wood  on the hillside as of yore. I look into his room the following day, and  find him in his night-shirt busy extracting the tail-bone from his  trophy, and he stops in his work only to ask when the hounds will be out  again.    The power of enjoying hunting of any sort is no evidence of want of  tenderer feelings. It may be that the days of sport are numbered by the  exigencies of what is termed the progress of civilization; but whether  men's hearts will be braver, their bodies and minds healthier, or their  natures kindlier and happier for the change, only time may show. All  this is something in the nature of apology; but, excuse or none,  thousands are conscious that the nearest approach to pure unmixed  pleasure that they have known has been derived from the chase, where  cares are forgotten, pulses quickened, eyes brightened, and the mind  refreshed. About conscious or unconscious vicarious sacrifice with  regard to the badger I will not say more than this, that the baiting of  an animal in confinement, even though he be but the scapegoat for a  thousand of his kind, is so repugnant to humanity, and so likely to  breed cruelty, that though I lament his imminent extinction I would say,  \"perish _Meles taxus_\" rather than let him pay this price for the  continuance of his race, and, whatever view he might have himself, I  would refuse him the option.    The badger has made a wonderful struggle for existence, and may linger  on for many years yet in the more secluded corners of England and Wales  (in Scotland he is almost extinct), but he owes all to his own  mysterious silent ways, and nothing to man's mercy in the matter. The  intelligent and unprejudiced wearers of velveteen, who, with the tacit  consent of their masters, have by means of the steel trap, flag-trap,  and gun, exterminated and banished for ever the most interesting of our  animals and the most beautiful of our birds, have hitherto failed in  their ruthless attempt to rid earth and heaven of everything but furred  and feathered game, so far as the badger is concerned. In many English  counties, however, the badger has given in before ceaseless digging,  snaring, and shooting, and the silent covert where he had his earth,  where he dug and delved and made his wonderful subterranean stronghold,  knows him no more. He has gone with the polecat, the pine marten, the  wild cat, the harriers, the buzzards, and a host of the brightest and  loveliest of our birds. Guiltless of the crimes of his fellow-victims  against game, he was and is still ignorantly classed under that  all-embracing word of the keeper, \"vermin.\" There are few who lament his  disappearance save perhaps the makers of shaving-brushes, and the old  people whose faith in the efficacy of \"badger-grease\" can no longer find  the opportunity of exercising the same. This faith is an old one. I read  in the _Sporting Magazine_, 1800, volume xvii.--\"The flesh, blood, and  grease of the badger are very useful for oils, ointments, salves, and  powders, for shortness of breath, the cough of the lungs, for the stone,  sprained sinews, coll-achs, etc. The skin, being well dressed, is very  warm and comfortable for ancient people who are troubled with paralytic  disorders.\" Evidently a few badgers in the good old days supplied the  place of the country doctor. About the fancied or really mischievous  habits of the badger I shall have something to say later on.          PART II      The badger (_Meles taxus_, or _Ursus meles_) is known under various  aliases, viz. the Brock (Danish _Broc_, Erse _Broc_, Welsh _Brock_), the"]]]
