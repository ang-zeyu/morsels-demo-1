Six of the party returned more rapidly, covering the 100  miles in forty-six hours, the last 50 being covered in seven and a-half  hours. During these marches the horses were ridden for eighty-three  hours, the remaining fifty-eight hours of the time occupied being  absorbed by halts.    The reconnaissance party having returned on the 5th, the regiment,  numbering 8 officers and 127 men, with 155 horses, started, on January  8, to march with General Sir Herbert Stewart's column across the desert  to Gubat. This march, 336 miles, occupied from January 8 to February 20,  4 miles only being covered in the hour they were moving on the last  date. They halted on the 13th at Gakdul; whereby the average day's  journey works out at nearly 26 miles per day, or, if we ignore the march  (4 miles in one hour) of January 20, at nearly 28 miles per day. The  hardest day was the 16th, when the regiment travelled 40 miles in 11-1/2  hours, from 4.30 a.m. to 4 p.m., the horses receiving each half-a-gallon  of water and 4 lbs. of food grain. Their ability to work on scanty diet  was put to the test on this fortnight's march. The average daily ration  for the first ten days was from 5 to 6 lbs. of grain and 2 gallons of  water; the horses covering an average of 31 miles per day exclusive of  the halt at Gakdul on the 13th.    When the final advance to the Nile was made, the horses went fifty-five  hours with no water at all, and only 1 lb. of grain; some 15 or 20  horses were upwards of seventy hours without water. During their halt at  Gubat from January 20 to February 14, they had received but one ration  of grain, 6 lbs. given them two days before they had to start for the  Nile. During this period they performed out-post and patrol duty  averaging about 8 miles daily.    On the return march, the journey between Dongola and Wady Halfa, 250  miles, was performed on an average rate of 16 miles per day, with one  two-days' halt. On this march the regiment usually travelled at night  for the sake of coolness, but the scanty shade available generally  compelled exposure to the hot sun all day.    Colonel Barrow remarks, \"I think it may be considered a most remarkable  circumstance that out of 350 horses, during nine months on a hard  campaign, only twelve died from disease.\" Colonel Biddulph sums up the  work of the horses in a few words: \"The performance of the small Arab  horses, both with the river and desert columns, carrying a heavy weight,  on scanty fare and less water, is a marvel of endurance.\" The former  officer attributes the small percentage of loss from disease to the  facts (1) that the climate of the Soudan is most suitable for horses,  (2) that the Syrian horse has a wonderful constitution, and is admirably  suited for warfare in an Eastern climate. Colonel Barrow's opinion on  the suitability of the Eastern climate for horses must not be read as  meaning for horses of all breeds. On the contrary, Colonel Biddulph, in  words quoted on a previous page, states that experience had shown that  English horses could not withstand the conditions of campaigning in the  Soudan.    Sir Richard Green Price, writing over the familiar pen-name of  \"Borderer,\" in _Baily's Magazine_, has urged the formation of a regiment  of Lilliputian horse, to consist of men under five feet, or five feet  six inches, weighing not over eleven stone, of good chest measurement:  these he would mount on ponies not over 14.2 and equip with light arms  and accoutrements. As he points out, increase in our cavalry is an  admitted necessity, and this branch of it in particular appeals to the  common sense of the people as a quick and handy service:         \"After many years of practical experience of what ponies can       and do accomplish, especially well-bred ones hardily reared, I       do not hesitate to say that they will beat moderate horses of       double their size, and that very few of our present cavalry       horses could live with them in a campaign--they are more easily       taught, handled and mounted than bigger horses, and with twice       their constitution and thrice their sense--with riders to suit       them, where are the drawbacks to their employment?\"    Sir Richard, in brief, urges the creation of a regiment of scouts or  mounted infantry whose horses shall be of much the same type of those  described by Colonel Barrow.    The special correspondent of the _Times_ with the Modder River force, in  course of an article on this arm, which appears likely to play a large  part in the wars of the future, writes thus of the animals used by the  Colonists and Boers:--         \"Here in South Africa the country-bred pony, tractable, used to       fire, and taught to remain where he is left if the reins be       dropped from the bit, is already a half-trained animal for       these purposes, and the work of training has been slight in       consequence; but in Afghanistan, and other places where the       mounted infantry man has been tried in a lesser degree, the       chief cause of trouble has been found in his mount.\"    The South African ponies ridden by the Colonial scouts and mounted  infantry have acquired their education as shooting ponies on the veldt  under conditions very similar to those prevailing in warfare. There is  radical difference between animals so trained and ill-broken Indian  country-breds whose tempers have been far too frequently spoiled by  rough usage in native hands. The mounted infantry in Afghanistan might  well find trouble with such ponies.      [Illustration: ONE OF REMINGTON'S HORSE.    _Showing type of horse used by mounted infantry and scouts in the South    African War._    (By permission of the Proprietors of the \"Daily Graphic.\")]          BURNABY'S RIDE TO KHIVA.      Captain Burnaby, in his well-known book, _A Ride to Khiva_, describes  the animals brought up for his inspection at Kasala, in Turkestan, when  his wish to buy a horse was made known:--         \"The horses were for the most part of the worst description,       that is to say, as far as appearance was concerned.... Except       for their excessive leanness, they looked more like huge       Newfoundland dogs than as connected with the equine race, and       had been turned out in the depth of winter with no other       covering save the thick coats which nature had given them....       At last, after rejecting a number of jades which looked more       fit to carry my boots than their wearer, I selected a little       black horse. He was about 14 hands in height, and I eventually       became his owner, saddle and bridle into the bargain, for the       sum of L5, this being considered a very high price at Kasala.\"    The reader may be reminded that the winter of 1876-7, during which  Captain Burnaby accomplished his adventurous journey, was an  exceptionally severe one even for that part of the world, where long and  severe winters are the rule. On the day of his departure from Kasala the  thermometer stood at eight degrees below zero. The traveller was by no  means favourably impressed with the powers of the horse he had selected  as the least bad of a very poor lot, and the native guides started  apparently satisfied that it would break down under its heavy rider clad  to resist the penetrating cold.    After his second march, Captain Burnaby began to acquire a certain  measure of respect for this pony:--         \"What had surprised me most during our morning's march was the       extreme endurance of our horses. The guide frequently had been       obliged to dismount and to clean out their nostrils, which were       entirely stuffed with icicles; but the little animals had       ploughed their way steadily through the snow.... The one I       rode, which in England would not have been considered able to       carry my boots, was as fresh as possible after his march of       seventeen miles. In spite of the weight on his back--quite       twenty stone--he had never shown the least sign of fatigue.\"    Again, a few days later, the conditions of the journey having been no  less trying:--         \"From Jana Darya we rode forty miles without a halt. I must say       that I was astonished to see how well the Kirghiz horses stood       the long journeys. We had now gone 300 miles; and my little       animal, in spite of his skeleton-like appearance, carried me       quite as well as the day he left Kasala, this probably being       owing to the change in his food from grass to barley. We are       apt to think very highly of English horses, and deservedly as       far as pace is concerned; but if it came to a question of       endurance, I much doubt whether our large and well fed horses       could compete with the little half-starved Kirghiz animals.       This is a subject which must be borne in mind in the event of       future complications in the East.\"    It is clear that Captain Burnaby was somewhat puzzled by the qualities  displayed by a steed which looked so unpromising; he seeks to explain  its performance by the better food it had enjoyed while on the march,  and begins to compare the staying power of English horses with those of  the Kirghiz pony with doubts as to the superiority of the former. At a  later date he records without surprise that his party travelled forty  miles in six hours, the horses having gone all the time at a slow steady  trot. On his return journey, while staying at Petro-Alexandrovsk, he was  given a mount on a little bay, hardly 14 hands high, for a day's  hunting; and records that it \"danced about beneath me as if he had been  carrying a feather-weight jockey for the Cambridgeshire.\" The Kirghiz  and Bokharans who accompanied him evidently thought his weight would  prove too much for the pony, and when there was a ditch to be jumped  looked round to see how the bay would manage it. \"Never a stumble "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],[0,"In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#2)"],[1,"very useful to him on  his first start in life. After breakfast next morning Dr. Sandwith  asked Harry to take a turn in the garden with him, for the holidays  had just begun.    \"What do you think of this, Harry?\"    \"I have not thought much about it one way or the other, sir,\"  Harry said, looking up with a smile. \"It seemed to me better that  you should do the thinking for both of us.\"    \"I might perhaps be better able to judge whether it would  be advantageous or otherwise for you to accept the offer, but you  must be the best judge as to whether you would like to accept it  or not.\"    \"I can't quite make up my mind as to that, sir. I like school very  much and I like being at home. I don't want to learn Frenchified  ways, nor to eat frogs and snails and all sorts of nastiness;  still, it would be fun going to a place so different to England,  and hearing no English spoken, and learning all their rum ways,  and getting to jabber French.\"    \"It might be very useful to you in the army, Harry;\" and then the  doctor stopped suddenly.    \"The army!\" Harry exclaimed in a tone of astonished delight.  \"Oh,  sir, do you really think of my going into the army? You never said  a word about that before. I should like that immensely.\"    \"That slipped out, Harry, for I did not mean to say anything about  it until you had left school; still, if you go to France I do not  know why you should not keep that before you. I don't think the army  is a very good profession, but you do not seem to have any marked  talent for anything else. You don't like the idea of medicine or  the church, and you were almost heart-broken when I wanted you to  accept the offer of your uncle John of a seat in his counting-house.  It seems to me that the army would suit you better than anything  else, and I have no doubt that I could get you a commission. Now,  whenever we fight France is sure to be on the other side, and I  think that it would be of great advantage to you to have a thorough  knowledge of French--a thing which very few officers in our army  possess. If you accept this offer you will have the opportunity of  attaining this, and at the same time of earning a nice little sum  which would pay for your outfit and supply you with pocket-money  for some time.\"    \"Yes, sir, it would be first rate!\" Harry exclaimed excitedly. \"Oh,  please, accept the offer; I should like it of all things; and even  if I do get ever so skinny on frogs and thin soup, I can get fat  on roast beef again when I get back.\"    \"That is all nonsense, Harry, about frogs and starving. The French  style of cookery differs from ours, but they eat just as much, and  although they may not, as a rule, be as broad and heavy as Englishmen,  that is simply a characteristic of race; the Latin peoples are of  slighter build than the Teutonic. As to their food, you know that  the Romans, who were certainly judges of good living, considered  the snail a great luxury, and I dare say ate frogs too. A gentleman  who had made the grand tour told me that he had tasted them in Paris  and found them very delicate eating. You may not like the living  quite at first, but you will soon get over that, and once accustomed  to it you will like it quite as well as our solid joints. My  principal objection to your going lies quite in another direction.  Public opinion in France is much disturbed. In the National Assembly,  which is the same as our Parliament, there is a great spirit  of resistance to the royal authority, something like a revolution  has already been accomplished, and the king is little more than a  prisoner.\"    \"But that would surely make no difference to me, sir!\"    \"No, I don't see that it should, Harry. Still, it would cause your  mother a good deal of anxiety.\"    \"I don't see it could make any difference,\" Harry repeated; \"and  you see, sir, when I go into the army and there is war, mother  would be a great deal more anxious.\"    \"You mean, Harry,\" the doctor said with a smile, \"that whether her  anxiety begins a little sooner or later does not make much difference.\"    \"I don't think I quite meant that, sir,\" Harry said; \"but yes,\"  he added frankly, after a moment's thought, \"I suppose I did; but  I really don't see that supposing there were any troubles in France  it could possibly make any difference to me; even if there were a  civil war, such as we had in England, they would not interfere with  boys.\"    \"No, I don't see that it would make any difference, and the chance  is so remote that it need not influence our decision. Of course if  war broke out between the two countries the marquis would see that  you were sent back safely. Well, then, Harry, I am to consider that  your decision is in favour of your accepting this appointment.\"    \"If you please, sir. I am sure it will be a capital thing for me,  and I have no doubt it will be great fun. Of course at first it  will be strange to hear them all jabbering in French, but I suppose  I shall soon pick it up.\"    And so Mrs. Sandwith was informed by her husband that after talking  it over with Harry he had concluded that the proposed arrangement  would really be an excellent one, and that it would be a great pity  to let such an opportunity slip.    The good lady was for a time tearful in her forebodings that Harry  would be starved, for in those days it was a matter of national  opinion that our neighbours across the Channel fed on the most meagre  of diet; but she was not in the habit of disputing her husband's  will, and when the letter of acceptance had been sent off, she  busied herself in preparing Harry's clothes for his long absence.    \"He ought to be measured for several suits, my dear,\" she said to  her husband, \"made bigger and bigger to allow for his growing.\"    \"Nonsense, my dear! You do not suppose that clothes cannot be  purchased in France! Give him plenty of under-linen, but the fewer  jackets and trousers he takes over the better; it will be much  better for him to get clothes out there of the same fashion as  other people; the boy will not want to be stared at wherever he  goes. The best rule is always to dress like people around you. I  shall give him money, and directly he gets there he can get a suit  or two made by the tailor who makes for the lads he is going to be  with. The English are no more loved in France than the French are  here, and though Harry has no reason to be ashamed of his nationality  there is no occasion for him to draw the attention of everyone  he meets to it by going about in a dress which would seem to them  peculiar.\"    In due time a letter was received from Count Auguste de St.  Caux,  stating that the marquis had requested him to write and say that  he was much gratified to hear that one of the doctor's own sons  was coming over to be a companion and friend to his boys, and that  he was sending off in the course of two days a gentleman of his  household to Calais to meet him and  conduct him to Paris. On young  Mr. Sandwith's arrival at Calais he was to go at once to the Hotel  Lion door and ask for M. du Tillet.    During the intervening time Harry had been very busy, he had to  say good-bye to all his friends, who looked, some with envy, some  with pity, upon him, for the idea of a three years' residence in  France was a novel one to all. He was petted and made much of at  home, especially by his sisters, who regarded him in the light of  a hero about to undertake a strange and hazardous adventure.    Three days after the arrival of the letter of the marquis, Dr.  Sandwith and Harry started by stage for Dover, and the doctor put  his son on board the packet sailing for Calais. The evening before,  he gave him much good advice as to his behaviour.    \"You will see much that is new, and perhaps a good deal that you  don't like, Harry, but it is better for you never to criticize or  give a hostile opinion about things; you would not like it if a  French boy came over here and made unpleasant remarks about English  ways and manners. Take things as they come and do as others do;  avoid all comparisons between French and English customs; fall in  with the ways of those around you; and adopt as far as you can the  polite and courteous manner which is general among the French, and  in which, I must say, they are far ahead of us. If questioned, you  will, of course, give your opinion frankly and modestly; it is the  independence of thought among English boys which has attracted the  attention and approval of Auguste de St. Caux.    \"Be natural and simple, giving yourself no airs, and permitting  none on the part of the lads you are with; their father says you  are to be treated as their equal. But, upon the other hand, do not  be ever on the lookout for small slights, and bear with perfect  good temper any little ridicule your, to them foreign, ways and  manners may excite.  I need not tell you to be always straightforward,  honest, and true, for of those qualities I think you possess a fair  share. Above all things restrain any tendency to use your fists;  fighting comes naturally to English boys, but in France it is  considered as brutal and degrading--a blow is a deadly insult,  and would  never be forgiven.    \"So, whatever the provocation, abstain from striking anyone.  Should  you find that in any way your position is made intolerable, you  will of course appeal to the marquis, and unless you obtain redress  you will come home--you will find  no difficulty in travelling  when you once understand the language--but avoid anything like  petty complaints. I trust there will be no reason for complaints at  all, and that you will find your position an exceedingly pleasant  one as soon as you become accustomed to it; but should occasion  arise bear my words in mind.\"    Harry promised to follow his father's advice implicitly, but in  his own mind he wondered what fellows did when they quarrelled if  they were not allowed to fight; however, he supposed that he "]]]
