[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#2)"],[1," everything else  worth having, must be worked for--must be earned by patient endurance,  self-restraint, and loving consideration for the tastes, and even for  the faults, of him or her with whom life is to be lived.    And yet before the first year of married life has ended, most people  discover that Skelton's subject, \"How to be happy though married,\" was  not an unpractical one. Then they know that the path upon which they  have entered may be strewn with thorns instead of with roses, unless  mutual forbearance and mutual respect guard the way. The old bachelor  who said that marriage was \"a very harmless amusement\" would not have  pronounced such an unconditional judgment had he known more about it.  Matrimony is a harmless and a happy state only when careful precaution  is taken to defend the domain of the affections from harshness and  petulance, and to avoid certain moral and physical pitfalls.    Like government, marriage must be a series of compromises; and however  warm the love of both parties may be, it will very soon cool unless they  learn the golden rule of married life, \"To bear and to forbear.\" In  matrimony, as in so many other things, a good beginning is half the  battle. But how easily may good beginnings be frustrated through  infirmity of temper and other causes, and then we must \"tread those  steps with sorrow which we might have trod with joy.\"    \"I often think,\" says Archdeacon Farrar, \"that most of us in life are  like many of those sight-seers who saunter through this (Westminster)  Abbey. Their listless look upon its grandeur and its memorials furnishes  an illustration of the aspect which we present to higher powers as we  wander restlessly through the solemn minster-aisles of life.... We talk  of human misery; how many of us derive from life one-tenth part of what  God meant to be its natural blessedness? Sit out in the open air on a  summer day, and how many of us have trained ourselves to notice the  sweetness and the multiplicity of the influences which are combining for  our delight--the song of birds; the breeze beating balm upon the  forehead; the genial warmth; the delicate odour of ten thousand  flowers?\"    What is said here of life in general is also true of married life. We go  through the temple of Hymen without noticing, much less appreciating,  its beauty. Certainly few people gain as much happiness from their  marriage as they might. They expect to find happiness without taking any  trouble to make it, or they are so selfishly preoccupied that they  cannot enjoy. In this way many a husband and wife only begin to value  each other when death is at hand to separate them.    In married life sacrifices must be ever going on if we would be happy.  It is the power to make another glad which lights up our own face with  joy. It is the power to bear another's burden which lifts the load from  our own heart. To foster with vigilant, self-denying care the  development of another's life is the surest way to bring into our own  joyous, stimulating energy. Bestow nothing, receive nothing; sow  nothing, reap nothing; bear no burden of others, be crushed under your  own. If many people are miserable though married, it is because they  ignore the great law of self-sacrifice that runs through all nature, and  expect blessedness from receiving rather than from giving. They reckon  that they have a right to so much service, care, and tenderness from  those who love them, instead of asking how much service, care, and  tenderness they can give.    No knowledge is so well worth acquiring as the science of living  harmoniously for the most part of a life with another, which we might  take as a definition of matrimony. This science teaches us to avoid  fault-finding, bothering, boring, and other tormenting habits. \"These  are only trifling faults,\" you say. Yes, but trifles produce domestic  misery, and domestic misery is no trifle.      \"Since trifles make the sum of human things,    And half our misery from those trifles springs,    Oh! let the ungentle spirit learn from thence,    A _small_ unkindness is a _great_ offence.    To give rich gifts perhaps we wish in vain,    But all may shun the guilt of giving pain.\"    Husband and wife should burn up in the bonfire of first-love all hobbies  and \"little ways\" that could possibly prevent home from being sweet. How  happy people are, though married, when they can say of each other what  Mrs. Hare says of her husband in \"Memorials of a Quiet Life\": \"I never  saw anybody so easy to live with, by whom the daily petty things of  life were passed over so lightly; and then there is a charm in the  _refinement_ of feeling which is not to be told in its influence upon  trifles.\"    A married pair should be all the world to each other. Sydney Smith's  definition of marriage is well known: \"It resembles a pair of shears, so  joined that they cannot be separated, often moving in opposite  directions, yet always punishing any one who comes between them.\"  Certainly those who go between deserve to be punished; and in whatever  else they may differ, married people should agree to defend themselves  from the well-meant, perhaps, but irritating interference of friends.  Above all, they should remember the proverb about the home-washing of  soiled linen, for, as old Fuller said, \"Jars concealed are half  reconciled; while, if generally known, 'tis a double task to stop the  breach at home and men's mouths abroad.\"    Why should love-making end with courtship, and of what use are conquests  if they are not guarded? If the love of a life-partner is of far more  value than our perverse fancies, it is the part of wisdom to restrain  these in order to keep that. A suggestion was recently made from an  American pulpit that there was room for a new society which should teach  husband and wife their duty to each other. \"The first article of the  constitution should be that any person applying for membership should  solemnly covenant and agree that throughout married life he or she would  carefully observe and practise all courtesy, thoughtfulness, and  unselfishness that belong to what is known as the 'engagement' period.  The second article should be that neither member of a conjugal  partnership should listen to a single word of criticism of the other  member from any relative whatever, even should the words of wisdom drop  from the lips of father, mother, brother, or sister. The rules of the  new society need not extend beyond these two, for there would be nothing  in the conduct of members in good standing to require other special  attention.\"    The wife, on her part, ought not to be less desirous than she was in the  days of courtship of winning her husband's admiration, merely because  she now wears upon her finger a golden pledge of his love. Why should  she give up those pretty wiles to seem fair and pleasant in his eyes,  that were suggested in love-dreams? Instead of lessening her charms, she  should endeavour to double them, in order that home may be to him who  has paid her the greatest compliment in his power, the dearest and  brightest spot upon earth--one to which he may turn for comfort when  sick of business and the weary ways of men generally.    George Eliot tells us that marriage must be a relation either of  sympathy or of conquest; and it is undoubtedly true that much of the  matrimonial discord that exists arises from the mutual struggle for  supremacy. They go to church and say \"I will,\" and then, perhaps, on the  way home, one or other says \"I won't,\" and that begins it. \"What is the  reason,\" said one Irishman to another, \"that you and your wife are  always disagreeing?\" \"Because,\" replied Pat, \"we are both of one  mind--she wants to be master and so do I.\" How shall a man retain his  wife's affections? Is it by not returning them? Certainly not. The  secret of conjugal felicity is contained in this formula: demonstrative  affection and self-sacrifice. A man should not only love his wife  dearly, but he should tell her that he loves her, and tell her very  often, and each should be willing to yield, not once or twice, but  constantly, and as a practice to the other. Selfishness crushes out  love, and most of the couples who are living without affection for each  other, with cold and dead hearts, with ashes where there should be a  bright and holy flame, have destroyed themselves by caring too much for  themselves and too little for each other.    Each young couple that begins housekeeping on the right basis brings the  Garden of Eden before man once more. There are they, two, alone; love  raises a wall between them and the outer world. There is no serpent  there--and, indeed, he need never come, nor does he, so long as Adam and  Eve keep him at bay; but too often the hedge of love is broken, just a  little, by small discourtesies, little inattentions, small incivilities,  that gradually but surely become wider and wider holes, until there is  no hedge at all, and all sorts of monsters enter in and riot there.      \"Out of the very ripeness of life's core,    A worm was bred.\"    The only real preservative against this worm is true religion. Unhappily  for themselves the healthy and young sometimes fancy that _they_ need  not think of this. They forget that religion is required to ennoble and  sanctify this present life, and are too liable to associate it  exclusively with the contemplation of death. \"So 'a cried out--God, God,  God! three or four times: now I, to comfort him, bid him 'a should not  think of God; I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such  thoughts yet.\" This advice, which Mrs. Quickly gave to Falstaff on his  deathbed, reflects the thoughts of many people, but it was not sound  advice. Certainly it would be cruel rather than kind to advise a young  pair who have leaped into the dark of married life not to think of God.  He is a Saviour from trouble rather than a troubler, and the husband and  wife"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35542"],[0,"House Rats and Mice (#2)"],[1,"in cities.=--Aside from old dwellings, the chief refuges  for rats in cities are sewers, wharves, stables, and outbuildings.  Modern sewers are used by the animals merely as highways and not as  abodes, but old-fashioned brick sewers often afford nesting crannies.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Rat-proofing a frame dwelling by concrete side  wall (United States Public Health Service, New Orleans, La., 1914).]    Wharves, stables, and outbuildings in cities should be so built as to  exclude rats. Cement is the chief means to this end. Old tumble-down  buildings and wharves should not be tolerated in any city. (See fig. 2.)    In both city and country, wooden floors of sidewalks, areas, and porches  are commonly laid upon timbers resting on the ground. Under such floors  rats have a safe retreat from nearly all enemies. The conditions can be  remedied in towns by municipal action requiring that these floors be  replaced by others made of cement. Areas or walks made of brick are  often undermined by rats and may become as objectionable as those of  wood. Wooden floors of porches should always be well above the ground.    =Farm buildings.=--Granaries, corncribs, and poultry houses may be made  rat-proof by a liberal use of cement in the foundations and floors; or  the floors may be of wood resting upon concrete. Objection has been  urged against concrete floors for horses, cattle, and poultry, because  the material is too good a conductor of heat, and the health of the  animals suffers from contact with these floors. In poultry houses, dry  soil or sand may be used as a covering for the cement floor, and in  stables a wooden floor resting on concrete is just as satisfactory so  far as the exclusion of rats is concerned.    The common practice of setting corncribs on posts with inverted pans at  the top often fails to exclude rats, because the posts are not high  enough to place the lower cracks of the structure beyond reach of the  animals. As rats are excellent jumpers, the posts should be tall enough  to prevent the animals from obtaining a foothold at any place within 3  feet of the ground. A crib built in this way, however, is not very  satisfactory.    For a rat-proof crib a well-drained site should be chosen. The outer  walls, laid in cement, should be sunk about 20 inches into the ground.  The space within the walls should be grouted thoroughly with cement and  broken stone and finished with rich concrete for a floor. Upon this the  structure may be built. Even the walls of the crib may be of concrete.  Corn will not mold in contact with them, provided there is good  ventilation and the roof is water-tight.    However, there are cheaper ways of excluding rats from either new or old  corncribs. Rats, mice, and sparrows may be kept out effectually by the  use of either an inner or an outer covering of galvanized-wire netting  of half-inch mesh and heavy enough to resist the teeth of the rats. The  netting in common use in screening cellar windows is suitable for  covering or lining cribs. As rats can climb the netting, the entire  structure must be screened, or, if sparrows are not to be excluded, the  wire netting may be carried up about 3 feet from the ground, and above  this a belt of sheet metal about a foot in width may be tacked to the  outside of the building.    Complete working drawings for the practical rat-proof corncrib shown in  figures 3 and 4 may be obtained from the Office of Public Roads and  Rural Engineering of the department.    =Buildings for storing foodstuffs.=--Whenever possible, stores of food  for man or beast should be placed only in buildings of rat-proof  construction, guarded against rodents by having all windows near the  ground and all other possible means of entrance screened with netting  made of No. 18 or No. 20 wire and of 1/4-inch mesh. Entrance doors  should fit closely, should have the lower edges protected by wide strips  of metal, and should have springs attached, to insure that they shall  not be left open. Before being used for housing stores, the building  should be inspected as to the manner in which water, steam, or gas  pipes go through the walls, and any openings found around such pipes  should be closed with concrete.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Perspective of rat-proof corncrib, showing  concrete foundation by dotted lines; also belt of metal.]    If rat-proof buildings are not available, it is possible, by the use of  concrete in basements and the other precautions just mentioned, to make  an ordinary building practically safe for food storage.    When it is necessary to erect temporary wooden structures to hold  forage, grain, or food supplies for army camps, the floors of such  buildings should not be in contact with the ground, but elevated, the  sills having a foot or more of clear space below them. Smooth posts  rising 2 or 3 feet above the ground may be used for foundations, and the  floor itself may be protected below by wire netting or sheet metal at  all places where rats could gain a foothold. Care should be taken to  have the floors as tight as possible, for it is chiefly scattered grain  and fragments of food about a camp that attract rats.    =Rat-proofing by elevation.=--The United States Public Health Service  reports that in its campaigns against bubonic plague in San Francisco  (1907) and New Orleans (1914) many plague rats were found under the  floors of wooden houses resting on the ground. These buildings were made  rat-proof by elevation, and no case of either human or rodent plague  occurred in any house after the change. Placing them on smooth posts 18  inches above the ground, with the space beneath the floor entirely open,  left no hiding place for rats.    This plan is adapted to small dwellings throughout the South, and to  small summer homes, temporary structures, and small farm buildings  everywhere. Wherever rats might obtain a foothold on the top of the post  they may be prevented from gnawing the adjacent wood by tacking metal  plates or pieces of wire netting to floor or sill.      KEEPING FOOD FROM RATS AND MICE.    The effect of an abundance of food on the breeding of rodents should be  kept in mind. Well-fed rats mature quickly, breed often, and have large  litters. Poorly fed rats, on the contrary, reproduce less frequently and  have smaller litters. In addition, scarcity of food makes measures for  destroying the animals far more effective.    =Merchandise in stores.=--In all parts of the country there is a serious  economic drain in the destruction by rats and mice of merchandise held  for sale by dealers. Not only foodstuffs and forage, but textiles,  clothing, and leather goods are often ruined. This loss is due mainly to  the faulty buildings in which the stores are kept. Often it would be a  measure of economy to tear down the old structures and replace them by  new ones. However, even the old buildings may often be repaired so as to  make them practically rat-proof; and foodstuffs, as flour, seeds, and  meats, may always be protected in wire cages at slight expense. The  public should be protected from insanitary stores by a system of rigid  inspection.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Floor plan of rat-proof corncrib shown in figure  3.]    =Household supplies.=--Similar care should be exercised in the home to  protect household supplies from mice and rats. Little progress in  ridding the premises of these animals can be made so long as they have  access to supplies of food. Cellars, kitchens, and pantries often  furnish subsistence not only to rats that inhabit the dwelling, but to  many that come from outside. Food supplies may always be kept from rats  and mice if placed in inexpensive rat-proof containers covered with wire  netting. Sometimes all that is needed to prevent serious waste is the  application of concrete to holes in the basement wall or the slight  repair of a defective part of the building.    =Produce in transit.=--Much loss of fruits, vegetables, and other  produce occurs in transit by rail and on ships. Most of the damage is  done at wharves and in railway stations, but there is also considerable  in ships' holds, especially to perishable produce brought from warm  latitudes. Much of this may be prevented by the use of rat-proof cages  at the docks, by the careful fumigation of seagoing vessels at the end  of each voyage, and by the frequent fumigation of vessels in coastwise  trade; but still more by replacing old and decrepit wharves and station  platforms with modern ones built of concrete.    Where cargoes are being loaded or unloaded at wharves or depots, food  liable to attack by rats may be temporarily safeguarded by being placed  in rat-proof cages, or pounds, constructed of wire netting. Wooden boxes  containing reserve food held in depots for a considerable time or  intended for shipment by sea may be made rat-proof by light coverings of  metal along the angles. This plan has long been in use to protect naval  stores on ships and in warehouses. It is based on the fact that rats do  not gnaw the plane surfaces of hard materials, but attack doors,  furniture, and boxes at the angles only.    =Packing houses.=--Packing houses and abattoirs are often sources from  which rats secure subsistence, especially where meats are prepared for  market in old buildings. In old-style cooling rooms with double walls of  wood and sawdust insulation, always a source of annoyance because of rat  infestation, the utmost vigilance is required to prevent serious loss of  meat products. On the other hand, packing houses with modern  construction and sanitary devices have no trouble from rats or mice.    =Garbage and waste.=--Since much of the food of rats consists of garbage  and other waste materials, it is not enough to bar the animals from  markets, granaries, warehouses, and private food stores. Garbage and  offal of all kinds must be so disposed of that rats can not obtain them.    In cities and towns an"]]]
