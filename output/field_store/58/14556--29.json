Back of solid \"country kip\"; fronts of substantial  French calf; heel one inch high, with steel nails; countered outside;  straps narrow, of fine French calf put on \"astraddle,\" and set down to  the top of the back. The out-sole stout, Spanish oak, and pegged rather  than sewed, although either is good. They will weigh considerably less  than half as much as the clumsy, costly boots usually recommended for  the woods; and the added comfort must be tested to be understood.    The hat should be fine, soft felt with moderately low crown and wide  brim; color to match the clothing.    The proper covering for head and feet is no slight affair, and will be  found worth some attention. Be careful that the boots are not too tight,  or the hat too loose. The above rig will give the tourist one shirt, one  pair of drawers and a pair of socks to carry as extra clothing. A soft,  warm blanket-bag, open at the ends, and just long enough to cover the  sleeper, with an oblong square of water-proofed cotton cloth 6x8 feet,  will give warmth and shelter by night and will weigh together five or  six pounds. This, with the extra clothing, will make about eight pounds  of dry goods to pack over carries, which is enough. Probably, also, it  will be found little enough for comfort.    During a canoe cruise across the Northern Wilderness in the late summer,  I met many parties at different points in the woods, and the amount of  unnecessary duffle with which they encumbered themselves was simply  appalling. Why a shrewd business man, who goes through with a guide and  makes a forest hotel his camping ground nearly every night, should  handicap himself with a five-peck pack basket full of gray woolen and  gum blankets, extra clothing, pots, pans, and kettles, with a 9-pound  10-bore, and two rods--yes, and an extra pair of heavy boots hanging  astride of the gun--well, it is one of the things I shall never  understand. My own load, including canoe, extra clothing, blanket-bag,  two days' rations, pocket-axe, rod and knapsack, never exceeded 26  pounds; and I went prepared to camp out any and every night.    [Sidenote: Preparations]    People who contemplate an outing in the woods are pretty apt to commence  preparations a long way ahead, and to pick up many trifling articles  that suggest themselves as useful and handy in camp; all well enough in  their way, but making at least a too heavy load. It is better to  commence by studying to ascertain just how light one can go through  without especial discomfort. A good plan is to think over the trip  during leisure hours, and make out a list of indispensable articles,  securing them beforehand, and have them stowed in handy fashion, so that  nothing needful may be missing just when and where it cannot be  procured. The list will be longer than one would think, but need not be  cumbersome or heavy. As I am usually credited with making a cruise or a  long woods tramp with exceptionally light duffle, I will give a list of  the articles I take along--going on foot over carries or through the  woods.          Chapter II         KNAPSACK, HATCHET, KNIVES, TINWARE, RODS, FISHING TACKLE,       DITTY-BAG      The clothing, blanket-bag and shelter-cloth are all that need be  described in that line. The next articles that I look after are knapsack  (or pack basket), rod with reel, lines, flies, hooks, and all my fishing  gear, pocket-axe, knives and tinware. Firstly, the knapsack; as you are  apt to carry it a great many miles, it is well to have it right, and  easy-fitting at the start. Don't be induced to carry a pack basket. I am  aware that it is in high favor all through the Northern Wilderness, and  is also much used in other localities where guides and sportsmen most do  congregate. But I do not like it. I admit that it will carry a loaf of  bread, with tea, sugar, etc., without jamming; that bottles, crockery,  and other fragile duffle is safer from breakage than in an oil-cloth  knapsack. But it is by no means water-proof in a rain or a splashing  head sea, is more than twice as heavy--always growing heavier as it gets  wetter--and I had rather have bread, tea, sugar, etc., a little jammed  than water-soaked. Also, it may be remarked that man is a vertebrate  animal and ought to respect his backbone. The loaded pack basket on a  heavy carry never fails to get in on the most vulnerable knob of the  human vertebrae. The knapsack sits easy, and does not chafe. The one  shown in the engraving is of good form; and the original--which I have  carried for years--is satisfactory in every respect. It holds over half  a bushel, carries blanket-bag, shelter tent, hatchet, ditty-bag,  tinware, fishing tackle, clothes and two days' rations. It weighs,  empty, just twelve ounces.    [Sidenote: Hatchet and Knives]    [Illustration: KNAPSACK AND DITTY-BAG]    The hatchet and knives shown in the engraving will be found to fill the  bill satisfactorily so far as cutlery may be required. Each is good and  useful of its kind, the hatchet especially, being the best model I have  ever found for a \"double-barreled\" pocket-axe. And just here let me  digress for a little chat on the indispensable hatchet; for it is the  most difficult piece of camp kit to obtain in perfection of which I have  any knowledge. Before I was a dozen years old I came to realize that a  light hatchet was a sine qua non in woodcraft, and I also found it a  most difficult thing to get. I tried shingling hatchets, lathing  hatchets, and the small hatchets to be found in country hardware stores,  but none of them were satisfactory. I had quite a number made by  blacksmiths who professed skill in making edge tools, and these were  the worst of all, being like nothing on the earth or under  it--murderous-looking, clumsy, and all too heavy, with no balance or  proportion. I had hunted twelve years before I caught up with the  pocket-axe I was looking for. It was made in Rochester, by a surgical  instrument maker named Bushnell. It cost time and money to get it. I  worked one rainy Saturday fashioning the pattern in wood. Spoiled a day  going to Rochester, waited a day for the blade, paid $3.00 for it, and  lost a day coming home. Boat fare $1.00, and expenses $2.00, besides  three days lost time, with another rainy Sunday for making leather  sheath and hickory handle.    [Illustration: HATCHET AND KNIVES]    My witty friends, always willing to help me out in figuring the cost of  my hunting and fishing gear, made the following business-like estimate,  which they placed where I would be certain to see it the first thing in  the morning. Premising that of the five who assisted in that little  joke, all stronger, bigger fellows than myself, four have gone \"where  they never see the sun,\" I will copy the statement as it stands today,  on paper yellow with age. For I have kept it over forty years.                             A WOODSMAN,      _To getting up one limber-go-shiftless pocket-axe:_    DR.      Cost of blade                                        $3.00    Fare on boat                                          1.00    Expenses for 3 days                                   3.00    Three days lost time at $1.25 per day                 3.75    Two days making model, handle and sheath, say         2.00                                                      --------    Total                                               $12.75    Per contra, by actual value of axe                    2.00                                                      --------    Balance                                             $10.75    Then they raised a horse laugh, and the cost of that hatchet became a  standing joke and a slur on my \"business ability.\" What aggravated me  most was, that the rascals were not so far out in their calculation. And  was I so far wrong? That hatchet was my favorite for nearly thirty  years. It has been \"upset\" twice by skilled workmen; and, if my friend  \"Bero\" has not lost it, is still in service.    Would I have gone without it any year for one or two dollars? But I  prefer the double blade. I want one thick, stunt edge for knots, deers'  bones, etc., and a fine, keen edge for cutting clear timber.    A word as to knife, or knives. These are of prime necessity, and should  be of the best, both as to shape and temper. The \"bowies\" and \"hunting  knives\" usually kept on sale, are thick, clumsy affairs, with a sort of  ridge along the middle of the blade, murderous-looking, but of little  use; rather fitted to adorn a dime novel or the belt of \"Billy the Kid,\"  than the outfit of the hunter. The one shown in the cut is thin in the  blade, and handy for skinning, cutting meat, or eating with. The strong  double-bladed pocket knife is the best model I have yet found, and, in  connection with the sheath knife, is all sufficient for camp use. It is  not necessary to take table cutlery into the woods. A good fork may be  improvised from a beech or birch stick; and the half of a fresh-water  mussel shell, with a split stick by way of handle, makes an excellent  spoon.    [Sidenote: _Cooking Utensils_]    My entire outfit for cooking and eating dishes comprises five pieces of  tinware. This is when stopping in a permanent camp. When cruising and  tramping, I take just two pieces in the knapsack.    I get a skillful tinsmith to make one dish as follows: Six inches on  bottom, 6-3/4 inches on top, side 2 inches high. The bottom is of the  heaviest tin procurable, the sides of lighter tin, and seamed to be  water-tight without solder. The top simply turned, without wire. The  second dish to be made the same, but small enough to nest in the first,  and also to fit into it when inverted as a cover. Two other dishes made  from common pressed tinware, with the tops cut off and turned, also  without wire.

What is the true reason for this change, a change which, born in America  and in England, is now commencing to exert some slight influence in  Germany? The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. Every act  of wrong done to Jews rendered them the more rigid in their belief,  causing at the same time differentiation in their surroundings.  Whenever, through the operation of better, more humane laws, oppression  was removed, Jews became more like the men among whom they lived. Why  should M. Renan find fault with the French Jew, and take the Parisian  Israelite as the type of some Hebraic Athenian? Under normal conditions  men float in the general current, at about equal depths, for the social  law of specific gravity remains forever the same. Those sociologists  are ignorant of their calling who demand, then, of the Jew an  instantaneous reversal of an existence formed by his surroundings, and a  forgetting of the great belief which has been burned into his heart by  the fires of thousands of years.    To the American Jew, \"The Jews of Barnow\" shows very clearly a great  many things he may have been ignorant about. Jews who came to this  country fifty years since, who by thrift, honesty, and intelligence,  have secured an ample store of the world's goods, are prone to forget  their early surroundings, or hesitate to tell their American children of  that bigotry which existed in their European birth-places. They have  educated their children in their own creed; but American school-boys or  school-girls have had one inestimable blessing, the contact with an  outer world and the opportunity of thinking for themselves. Education  and superstition can never have a co-existence. These fathers would feel  ashamed, then, did they tell their children the absurdities which they  once were taught. That one story of Franzos's, \"The Child of Atonement,\"  is a revelation. As an American Jew reads it, he might be inclined to  deem the Rabbi of Sadagora a Torquemada, or that it was a clever  creation, having no existence save in the brain of the romance-writer.  But it is not a fancy-drawn picture, but had once actual being. Such  stories as \"The Child of Atonement\" and \"The Nameless Graves\" can not be  read by any intelligent Jew without the burning brand of shame rising  to his cheeks. As to the truthfulness of many portions of Franzos's  book, unfortunately there can be no possible doubt. There may not be  many Rabbis of Sadagora, but excommunication, the _cherem_, that social  inquisition, is as prevalent in Russia and Poland, in 1882, as it was a  thousand years ago. The Rabbi of Sadagora of Franzos's book is dead, but  his son actually lives, exercises perhaps not the same cruelties, but  attributes to himself the identical miraculous functions as did his  wicked father before him, and still this younger medicine-man has his  followers.    \"The Jews of Barnow\" should make the existence of a Rabbi of Sadagora an  impossibility. Jewish women who read \"The Jews of Barnow\" will be amazed  to learn how degraded is the condition of their sex in Eastern Europe.  That one horrible text in their prayer-book, said by the men, \"Thank God  that thou hast not made me a woman,\" belongs to the period of the  coarsest barbarity. It is incorporated in innumerable volumes, now  perhaps being printed. Educated Jews who read this vicious paragraph,  who think of mother, wife, and daughter, feel the degradation of it, and  loathe its interpretation. We can not agree with Frances Power Cobbe in  the general application of this sentence of hers, that \"something  appears to be lacking in Jewish feeling concerning women. Too much of  Oriental materialism still lingers. Too little of Occidental chivalry  and romance has yet arisen.\" This might be applicable for the East, even  in its most exaggerated sense, but is hardly just to the West. Still, as  Franzos tells us in his book, girls are sold to men, and become, it is  true, wives, but with as little ceremony as if they were Circassians.    The oldest source of any religion is not the purest, \"If it be an  historical religion, fanaticism always assumes the form of a return to  the primitive type.\" The ultra-orthodox Jew is ruled by the Ashkenazim  of Jerusalem, the most superstitious, the most ignorant of men. This  sect still fights for power. Even the purity of the Ashkenazim's belief,  monotheism, the only thing left it, must be taken with suspicion,  because the sanity or sincerity of any Cabalist is to be doubted.    There are little, if any, differences existing in the social strata,  educated or uneducated, which uphold Christian beliefs. If Rome is the  fountain-head of Catholicity, Jerusalem ought to be the true source  whence Hebraism flows. The Holy City of the Jews does exert its  influence over millions of the ultra-orthodox, but for educated  Israelites has no more weight than have the decrees of any  miracle-working rabbi who holds forth in Cracow. If there be in Russia,  Finland, Scandinavia, Austria, Hungary, Roumania, Turkey, some five and  a half million Jews, and in England, France, and the United States, half  a million more, what a vast proportion are steeped in darkness!    What does as much as anything else to injure the Jew, and to make  mankind his enemy, is that belief he entertains that he is the race \"God  cherishes most.\" This is, indeed, tribalism. Selected by the Creator as  his special favorites, pious Jews think that to them \"all blessings  shall be given.\" Once it was believed that a Jew's brain was made of a  finer material, that he was less subject to dementia, than others. Some  very sad personal observations assure the writer that such is not the  case. If anything, in that struggle for wealth in which Jews engage in  the large cities of the United States, they have children more prone to  feeble-mindedness than Christians. The close-marriage system of the Jews  may in a certain measure induce degeneracy by exhaustion of the original  stock, for the laws of nature are inexorable, and act alike in Christian  or Mohammedan. That preservation of his race is something the Jew most  particularly prides himself about. The Parsee, who for so long a time  has had a religion apart, presents the precise condition of an isolated  existence which the Jew is so proud of. Morality, continence, the sacred  character of the marriage-ties, do in a certain measure preserve the  Jewish race, but the miraculous in such fractional existence has nothing  marvelous about it. This self-laudation of race, that \"pride-belief,\" is  the most difficult to eradicate, for it has been the consolation of an  oppressed race.    What, then, is reform, this Jewish reform? It is pure, unadulterated  monotheism. It believes that men, though they may expound religion, can  not create it. It looks on the Talmud, as did Emanuel Deutsch, as the  most poetical, the most confusing of chronicles, but utterly worthless  for the guidance of any human being--a curiosity, patched over,  embroidered, by a thousand different hands, something to be placed in a  cabinet, to be gazed on, but as practically useless for human  instruction as would be the Arthurian romances. Yahya ibn Main was a  worshiper of the Prophet, and labored all his life to purify the text of  his Koran, and thus he is recorded to have said: \"I wrote down numbers  of traditions under the dictation of liars, and made use of the paper  for heating my ovens. I thus obtained at least one advantage--my bread  was well baked.\" One saying in the Talmud is applicable to it: \"They  dived into the ocean and brought up a potsherd.\" Oh, the _olla-podrida_  of nonsense in it! And still it shapes the lives of millions of Jews; it  warps their ways, for it is almost their only book.    The Reformer is no iconoclast, he is educated enough not to wish to  destroy this relic of a past, but he is striving to expunge it, to  deprive the Talmud from exerting its baleful influence. The reformed Jew  believes in a God of mercy--one of love. He thinks that his Creator is  not a vengeful being. He does not believe that Christ was the Son of  God, doubts even a coming Messiah, but thinks that modern teachings have  done for man's immortal soul what the older lawgivers did for grosser  flesh and blood only. What the Reformer desires most especially is that  he shall have readers, clergymen (call them what you please), who shall  not only be familiar with the language they live in, but have the  highest, the very highest education, be in fact the equals of those who  preach to their Christian friends. These Reformers sicken over those  attempts of crass ignorance which, through the borrowed sanctity of a  salaried office, assume the direction of educated intelligence. The  majority of these Reformers are utterly indifferent to dietary  regulations. Can peace with God, a resurrection of the soul after the  death of the body, entrance to heaven, have anything to do with the  eating of a mollusk? Could the great Creator have made food for one man  which another dare not eat? Trivialities, mixed up in religion, debase  it, weaken it, sap it to its very vitals. A stronger, more hearty belief  must emancipate itself from puerilities. A reformed Jew can not be a  materialist, though he may strip religion of its symbolisms.    Millennium is far distant, and a Bishop of Sadagora and a Goldwin Smith  may never, perhaps, lie in the same bed, or sup at the same banquet, for  both of them represent that antagonism which inflamed England in King  John's time, or is rampant to-day with Pastor Stoecker in King William of  Prussia's reign. \"Every country has the Jews it deserves,\" writes  Franzos, quoting the most direful of sayings. God help, in his infinite  mercy, American-born Jews if, in generations to come, this cruel speech  had ever an application! It"]]]
