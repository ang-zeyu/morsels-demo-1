Indeed, for two periods,  each of several years, any attempt at bookish occupation would have been  merely suicidal. A condition of sight arising from kindred sources has  also retarded the work, since it has never permitted reading or  writing continuously for much more than five minutes, and often has not  permitted them at all. A previous work, \"The Conspiracy of Pontiac,\" was  written in similar circumstances.    The writer means, if possible, to carry the present design to its  completion. Such a completion, however, will by no means be essential  as regards the individual volumes of the series, since each will form  a separate and independent work. The present work, it will be seen,  contains two distinct and completed narratives. Some progress has been  made in others.    Boston. January 1,1865.          Part One      HUGOENOTS IN FLORIDA          PREFATORY NOTE TO THE    HUGUENOTS IN FLORIDA.    The story of New France opens with a tragedy. The political and  religious enmities which were soon to bathe Europe in blood broke out  with an intense and concentrated fury in the distant wilds of Florida.  It was under equivocal auspices that Coligny and his partisans essayed  to build up a Calvinist France in America, and the attempt was met by  all the forces of national rivalry, personal interest, and religious  hate.    This striking passage of our early history is remarkable for the  fullness and precision of the authorities that illustrate it. The  incidents of the Huguenot occupation of Florida are recorded by eight  eye-witnesses. Their evidence is marked by an unusual accord in respect  to essential facts, as well as by a minuteness of statement which  vividly pictures the events described. The following are the principal  authorities consulted for the main body of the narrative.    Ribauld, 'The Whole and True Discovery of Terra Florida,' This is  Captain Jean Ribaut's account of his voyage to Florida in 1562. It  was \"prynted at London,\" \"newly set forthe in Englishe,\" in 1563, and  reprinted by Hakluyt in 1582 in his black-letter tract entitled 'Divers  Voyages.' It is not known to exist in the original French.    'L'Histoire Notable de la Floride, mise en lumiere par M. Basanier'  (Paris, 1586). The most valuable portion of this work consists of the  letters of Rene de Laudonniere, the French commandant in Florida in  1564-65. They are interesting, and, with necessary allowance for the  position and prejudices of the writer, trustworthy.    Challeux, Discours de l'Histoire de la Floride (Dieppe, 1566). Challeux  was a carpenter, who went to Florida in 1565. He was above sixty years  of age, a zealous Huguenot, and a philosopher in his way. His story is  affecting from its simplicity. Various editions of it appeared under  various titles.    Le Moyne, Brevis Narratio eorum qucs in Florida Americce Provincia  Gallis acciderunt. Le Moyne was Laudonniere's artist. His narrative  forms the Second Part of the Grands Voyages of De Bry (Frankfort, 1591).  It is illustrated by numerous drawings made by the writer from memory,  and accompanied with descriptive letter-press.    Coppie d'une Lettre venant de la Floride (Paris, 1565). This is a letter  from one of the adventurers under Laudonniere. It is reprinted in the  Recueil de Pieces sur la Floride of Ternaux.-Compans. Ternaux also  prints in the same volume a narrative called Histoire memorable du  dernier Voyage faict par le Capitaine Jean Ribaut. It is of no original  value, being compiled from Laudonniere and Challeux.    Une Bequete au Roy, faite en forme de Complainte (1566). This is a  petition for redress to Charles the Ninth from the relatives of the  French massacred in Florida by the Spaniards. It recounts many incidents  of that tragedy.    La Reprinse de la Floride par le Cappitaine Gourgue. This is a  manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale, printed in the Recueil of  Ternaux-Compans. It contains a detailed account of the remarkable  expedition of Dominique de Gourgues against the Spaniards in Florida in  1567-68.    Charlevoix, in his Histoire de la Nouvelle France, speaks of another  narrative of this expedition in manuscript, preserved in the Gourgues  family. A copy of it, made in 1831 by the Vicomte de Gourgues, has been  placed at the writer's disposal.    Popeliniere, De Thou, Wytfleit, D'Aubigne De Laet, Brantome, Lescarbot,  Champlain, and other writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,  have told or touched upon the story of the Huguenots in Florida; but  they all draw their information from one or more of the sources named  above.    Lettres et Papiers d' Estat du Sieur de Forguevaulx (Bibliotheque  Nationale). These include the correspondence of the French and Spanish  courts concerning the massacre of the Huguenots. They are printed by  Gaffarel in his Histoire de le Floride Francaise.    The Spanish authorities are the following--Barcia (Cardenas y Cano),  Ensayo Cronologico para la Historia General de la Florida (Madrid,  1723). This annalist had access to original documents of great interest.  Some of them are used as material for his narrative, others are copied  entire. Of these, the most remarkable is that of Solis de las Meras,  Memorial de todas las Jornadas de la Conquista de la Florida.    Francisco Lopez de Mendoza Grajales, Relacion de la Jornada de Pedro  Menendez de Aviles en la Florida (Documentos Ineditos del Archivo de  Indias, III. 441). A French translation of this journal will be found  in the Recueil de Pieces sur let Floride of Ternaux-Compans. Mendoza was  chaplain of the expedition commanded by Menendez de Aviles, and, like  Solfs, he was an eye-witness of the events which he relates.    Pedro Menendez de Aviles, Siete Cartas escritas al Rey, Anos de 1565 y  1566, MSS. These are the despatches of the Adelantado Menendez to Philip  the Second. They were procured for the writer, together with other  documents, from the archives of Seville, and their contents are now for  the first time made public. They consist of seventy-two closely written  foolscap pages, and are of the highest interest and value as regards the  present subject, confirming and amplifying the statements of Solis and  Mendoza, and giving new and curious information with respect to the  designs of Spain upon the continent of North America.    It is unnecessary to specify the authorities for the introductory and  subordinate portions of the narrative.    The writer is indebted to Mr. Buckingham Smith, for procuring copies of  documents from the archives of Spain; to Mr. Bancroft, the historian of  the United States, for the use of the Vicomte de Gourgues's copy of the  journal describing the expedition of his ancestor against the Spaniards;  and to Mr. Charles Russell Lowell, of the Boston Athenaeum, and Mr.  John Langdon Sibley, Librarian of Harvard College, for obliging aid in  consulting books and papers.            HUGUENOTS IN FLORIDA.        CHAPTER I.    1512-1561.    EARLY SPANISH ADVENTURE.    Towards the close of the fifteenth century, Spain achieved her final  triumph over the infidels of Granada, and made her name glorious through  all generations by the discovery of America. The religious zeal and  romantic daring which a long course of Moorish wars had called forth  were now exalted to redoubled fervor. Every ship from the New World came  freighted with marvels which put the fictions of chivalry to shame; and  to the Spaniard of that day America was a region of wonder and mystery,  of vague and magnificent promise. Thither adventurers hastened,  thirsting for glory and for gold, and often mingling the enthusiasm  of the crusader and the valor of the knight-errant with the bigotry of  inquisitors and the rapacity of pirates. They roamed over land and sea;  they climbed unknown mountains, surveyed unknown oceans, pierced the  sultry intricacies of tropical forests; while from year to year and from  day to day new wonders were unfolded, new islands and archipelagoes, new  regions of gold and pearl, and barbaric empires of more than Oriental  wealth. The extravagance of hope and the fever of adventure knew  no bounds. Nor is it surprising that amid such waking marvels the  imagination should run wild in romantic dreams; that between the  possible and the impossible the line of distinction should be but  faintly drawn, and that men should be found ready to stake life and  honor in pursuit of the most insane fantasies.    Such a man was the veteran cavalier Juan Ponce de Leon. Greedy of honors  and of riches, he embarked at Porto Rico with three brigantines, bent  on schemes of discovery. But that which gave the chief stimulus to  his enterprise was a story, current among the Indians of Cuba and  Hispaniola, that on the island of Bimini, said to be one of the Bahamas,  there was a fountain of such virtue, that, bathing in its waters,  old men resumed their youth. [1] It was said, moreover, that on a  neighboring shore might be found a river gifted with the same beneficent  property, and believed by some to be no other than the Jordan. [2]  Ponce de Leon found the island of Bimini, but not the fountain. Farther  westward, in the latitude of thirty degrees and eight minutes, he  approached an unknown land, which he named Florida, and, steering  southward, explored its coast as far as the extreme point of the  peninsula, when, after some farther explorations, he retraced his course  to Porto Rico.    Ponce de Leon had not regained his youth, but his active spirit was  unsubdued.    Nine years later he attempted to plant a colony in Florida; the Indians  attacked him fiercely; he was mortally wounded, and died soon afterwards  in Cuba.  [3]    The voyages of Garay and Vasquez de Ayllon threw new light on the  discoveries of Ponce, and the general outline of the coasts of Florida  became known to the Spaniards.

A miserable  sensation of having said too much crept over the general.    \"Ha!\" Van Schouten exclaimed. \"You say we must have a new resident. That  has been my idea, too. What bush-fighter have you that can lead two  hundred cut-throats like himself and harry these tigers out of their  lairs till they crawl on their bellies to beg for peace?\"    Inwardly cursing himself for his folly in ceasing to advocate Muller,  the general twiddled his thumbs and said nothing.    \"Well, _generaal_?\" Van Schouten rasped irascibly.    \"Ahem--you know what troops I have, your excellency. Mostly raw  recruits, here scarce three months. There is not a man among them I  would trust alone in the bush. After all, it might be wisest to give  Mynheer Muller another chance.\" His cheeks puffed till they were purple.    Van Schouten's face flamed.    \"Enough! Enough!\" he roared. \"If the military cannot keep our house in  order, Sachsen and I will find a man. That is all, _generaal_.  _Goedendag!_\"    Vanden Bosch made a hasty and none too dignified exit, damning under his  breath the administration that had transferred him from a highly  ornamental post in Amsterdam to live with this pepper-pot. He was hardly  out of the door before the governor shouted:    \"Sachsen! _Hola_, Sachsen!\"    The sound of the governor's voice had scarcely died in the marbled  corridors when Sachsen, the omniscient, the indispensable secretary,  bustled into the sanctum. His stooped shoulders were crooked in a  perpetual obeisance, and his damp, gray hair was plastered thinly over  his ruddy scalp; but the shrewd twinkle in his eyes and the hawklike  cast of his nose and chin belied the air of humility he affected.    \"Sachsen,\" the governor demanded, the eagle gleaming in his lean,  Caesarian face, \"where can I find a man that will bring peace to  Bulungan?\"    The wrinkled features of the all-knowing Sachsen crinkled with a smile  of inspiration.    \"Your excellency,\" he murmured, bowing low, \"there is Peter Gross,  freeholder of Batavia.\"    \"Peter Gross, _Pieter_ Gross,\" Van Schouten mused, his brow puckered  with a thoughtful frown. \"The name seems to have slipped my memory. What  has Peter Gross, freeholder of Batavia, done to merit such an  appointment at our hands, Sachsen?\"    The secretary bowed again, punctiliously.    \"Your excellency perhaps remembers,\" he reminded, \"that it was Peter  Gross who rescued Lieutenant Hendrik de Koren and twelve men from the  pirates of Lombock.\"    \"Ha!\" the governor exclaimed, his stern features relaxing a trifle.  \"Now, Sachsen, answer me truthfully, has this Peter Gross an eye for  women?\"    The secretary bent low.    \"Your excellency, the fairest flowers of Batavia are his to pick and  choose. The good God has given him a brave heart, a comely face, and  plenty of flesh to cover his bones. But his only mistress is the sea.\"    \"If I should send him to Bulungan, would that she-devil, Koyala, make  the same fool of him that she has of Muller?\" the governor demanded  sharply.    \"Your excellency, the angels above would fail sooner than he.\"    The governor's fist crashed on the table with a resounding thwack.    \"Then he is the man we need!\" he exclaimed. \"Where shall I find this  Peter Gross, Sachsen?\"    \"Your excellency, he is now serving as first mate of the Yankee  barkentine, _Coryander_, anchored in this port. He was here at the  _paleis_ only a moment ago, inquiring for news of three of his crew who  had exceeded their shore leave. I think he has gone to Ah Sing's _rumah  makan_, in the Chinese campong.\"    Van Schouten sprang from his great chair of state like a cockerel  fluttering from a roost. He licked his thin lips and curved them into a  smile.    \"Sachsen,\" he said, \"except myself, you are the only man in Java that  knows anything. My hat and coat, Sachsen, and my cane!\"          CHAPTER II    AH SING COUNTS HIS NAILS      Captain Threthaway, of the barkentine, _Coryander_, of Boston, should  have heeded the warning he received from his first mate, Peter Gross, to  keep away from the roadstead of Batavia. He had no particular business  in that port. But an equatorial sun, hot enough to melt the marrow in a  man's bones, made the _Coryander's_ deck a blistering griddle; there was  no ice on board, and the water in the casks tasted foul as bilge. So the  captain let his longing for iced tea and the cool depths of a palm-grove  get the better of his judgment.    Passing Timor, Floris, and the other links in the Malayan chain, Captain  Threthaway looked longingly at the deeply shaded depths of the mangrove  jungles. The lofty tops of the cane swayed gently to a breeze scarcely  perceptible on the _Coryander's_ sizzling deck. When the barkentine  rounded Cape Karawang, he saw a bediamonded rivulet leap sheer off a  lofty cliff and lose itself in the liana below. It was the last straw;  the captain felt he had to land and taste ice on his tongue again or  die. Calling his first mate, he asked abruptly:    \"Can we victual at Batavia as cheaply as at Singapore, Mr. Gross?\"    Peter Gross looked at the shore-line thoughtfully.    \"One place is as cheap as the other, Mr. Threthaway; but if it's my  opinion you want, I advise against stopping at Batavia.\"    The captain frowned.    \"Why, Mr. Gross?\" he asked sharply.    \"Because we'd lose our crew, and Batavia's a bad place to pick up  another one. That gang for'ard isn't to be trusted where there's liquor  to be got. 'Twouldn't be so bad to lose a few of them at  Singapore--there's always English-speaking sailors there waiting for a  ship to get home on; but Batavia's Dutch. We might have to lay around a  week.\"    \"I don't think there's the slightest danger of desertions,\" Captain  Threthaway replied testily. \"What possible reason could any of our crew  have to leave?\"    \"The pay is all right, and the grub is all right; there's no kicking on  those lines,\" Peter Gross said, speaking guardedly. \"But most of this  crew are drinking men. They're used to their rations of grog regular.  They've been without liquor since we left Frisco, except what they got  at Melbourne, and that was precious little. Since the water fouled on  us, they're ready for anything up to murder and mutiny. There'll be no  holding them once we make port.\"    Captain Threthaway flushed angrily. His thin, ascetic jaw set with  Puritan stubbornness as he retorted:    \"When I can't sail a ship without supplying liquor to the crew, I'll  retire, Mr. Gross.\"    \"Don't misunderstand me, captain,\" Peter Gross replied, with quiet  patience.    \"I'm not disagreeing with your teetotaler principles. They improve a  crew if you've got the right stock to work with. But when you take grog  away from such dock-sweepings as Smith and Jacobson and that little  Frenchman, Le Beouf, you take away the one thing on earth they're  willing to work for. We had all we could do to hold them in hand at  Melbourne, and after the contrary trades we've bucked the past week, and  the heat, their tongues are hanging out for a drop of liquor.\"    \"Let them dare come back drunk,\" the captain snapped angrily. \"I know  what will cure them.\"    \"They won't come back,\" Peter Gross asserted calmly.    \"Then we'll go out and get them,\" Captain Threthaway said grimly.    \"They'll be where they can't be found,\" Peter Gross replied.    Captain Threthaway snorted impatiently.    \"Look here, captain!\" Peter Gross exclaimed, facing his skipper  squarely. \"Batavia is my home when I'm not at sea. I know its ins and  outs. Knowing the town, and knowing the crew we've got, I'm sure a stop  there will be a mighty unpleasant experience all around. There's a  Chinaman there, Ah Sing, a public-house proprietor and a crimp, that  has runners to meet every boat. Once a man goes into his _rumah makan_,  he's as good as lost until the next skipper comes along short-handed and  puts up the price.\"    Captain Threthaway smiled confidently.    \"Poor as the crew is, Mr. Gross, there's no member of it will prefer  lodging in a Chinese crimp's public house ten thousand miles from home  to his berth here.\"    \"They'll forget his color when they taste his hot rum,\" Peter Gross  returned bruskly. \"And once they drink it, they'll forget everything  else. Ah Sing is the smoothest article that ever plaited a queue, and  they don't make them any slicker than they do in China.\"    Captain Threthaway's lips pinched together in irritation.    \"There are always the authorities,\" he remarked pettishly, to end the  controversy.    Peter Gross restrained a look of disgust with difficulty.    \"Yes, there are always the authorities,\" he conceded. \"But in the  Chinese campong they're about as much use as a landlubber aloft in a  blow. The campong is a little republic in itself, and Ah Sing is the man  that runs it. If the truth was known, I guess he's the boss Chinaman of  the East Indies--pirate, trader, politician--anything he can make a  guilder at. From his rum-shop warrens run into every section of  Chinatown, and they're so well hid that the governor, though he's sharp  as a weasel and by all odds the best man the Dutch ever had here, can't  find them. It's the real port of missing men.\"    Captain Threthaway looked shoreward, where dusky, breech-clouted natives  were resting in the cool shade of the heavy-leafed mangroves. A bit of  breeze stirred just then, bringing with it the rich spice-grove and  jungle scents of the thickly wooded island. A fierce longing for the  shore seized the captain. He squared his shoulders with decision.    \"I'll take the chance, Mr. Gross,\" he said. \"This heat is killing me.  You may figure on twenty-four hours in port.\"    Twelve hours after the _Coryander_ cast anchor in Batavia harbor, Smith,  Jacobson, and Le Beouf were reported missing. When Captain Threthaway,  for all his Boston upbringing, had exhausted "]]]
