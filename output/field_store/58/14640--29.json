In 1911 Alexander G.  Ruthven collected in the savanna country near Cuatotolapam, Veracruz;  the report on his collections (1912) is the first dealing with the  herpetofauna of a part of the isthmus. His specimens are in the  collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. Norman  Hartweg and James A. Oliver collected for the University of Michigan  Museum of Zoology in the vicinity of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, during the  summer of 1936. The results of their work were published as an  annotated list of species occurring on the Pacific slopes of the  isthmus (1940). Hobart M. Smith collected in the vicinity of  Tehuantepec in January, 1940; his specimens are in the United States  National Museum. Specimens collected by Smith served as the types of  _Eleutherodactylus avocalis_ Taylor and Smith and _Diaglena reticulata_  Taylor. Walter W. Dalquest collected vertebrates for the University of  Kansas in southern Veracruz in the winters of 1947 and 1948; he spent  about six months on the Gulf lowlands of the isthmus, principally in  the vicinity of Jesus Carranza. For the past two decades Thomas  MacDougall, a resident of New York City, has spent his winters  collecting biological specimens in southern Mexico. He makes his  headquarters at Tehuantepec, but his compulsion to see the \"back  country\" has taken him to many remote parts of southern Oaxaca. His  earlier collections are in the American Museum of Natural History; the  later ones are in the University of Illinois Museum of Natural History.    Minor collections include those made by Matthew W. Stirling at San  Lorenzo, Veracruz, February-April, 1946 (United States National  Museum), by Fred G. Thompson on a trip across the isthmus in December,  1955 (University of Michigan Museum of Zoology), by the University of  Kansas Museum of Natural History field party under the direction of  Rollin H. Baker at Tolosita, Oaxaca, and by David A. Langebartel and  associates from southern Oaxaca in June, 1958 (University of Illinois  Museum of Natural History).    In the collections of the United States National Museum are several  species of amphibians sent to the museum from Tehuantepec by Francis  Sumichrast. These include _Bolitoglossa platydactyla_ (USNM 30305,  30344-6, 30528), _Bolitoglossa rufescens_ (10042), _Chiropterotriton  chiropterus_ (30347), _Lineatriton lineola_ (30353), _Parvimolge  townsendi_ (30352), _Pseudoeurycea cephalica_ (30350), _Thorius  pennatulus_ (30348-9), _Hyla miotympanum_ (30302-3), and _Hyla picta_  (30304). Because of the poor condition of the specimens, determinations  of those listed as _Bolitoglossa rufescens_ and _Pseudoeurycea  cephalica_ are uncertain. With the exception of the _Bolitoglossa  rufescens_, which is stated to have come from Santa Efigenia, all of  these specimens are catalogued as having come from Tehuantepec. None of  these species has since been recorded from the Pacific slopes of the  isthmus; however, they all occur in the vicinity of Orizaba, Veracruz.  Probably Sumichrast carried the specimens with him from Orizaba, his  home before moving to Santa Efigenia, and shipped them from Tehuantepec  to the United States National Museum. These species definitely should  not be considered as inhabitants of the Pacific slopes of the Isthmus  of Tehuantepec.          DESCRIPTION OF THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC      The Isthmus of Tehuantepec is a strip of land forming a low pass, which  separates the mountain masses of Mexico proper from those of Central  America, and at the same time provides a continuum of lowlands from the  Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. This topography combines with the  climatic conditions to create extremely diverse environments, the  distribution of which can be adequately understood only after an  acquaintance with the topography and climate of the region.      _Physiography_    In east-central Oaxaca the mountain masses comprising the Sierra Madre  Oriental and the Sierra del Sur terminate in a series of ranges--Sierra  de Juarez, Sierra de los Mijes, and Sierra de Choapam. From lofty  peaks, such as Cerro de Zempoaltepetl (3400 meters), the highlands  diminish eastward to succeedingly lower ridges, until in the middle of  the Isthmus of Tehuantepec the continental divide is about 250 meters  above sea level. Eastward from this low divide the land rises to form  the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, which is continuous with the highland  masses of Guatemala.    For the purposes of this description, the lowlands of the isthmus may  be divided into three parts--the Gulf Coastal Plain, the central  ridges, and the Pacific Coastal Plain, which in the isthmus is called  the Plains of Tehuantepec (Figs. 1 and 2).    The Gulf Coastal Plain is broad and fairly level near the coast, but  rolling in the interior. The plain, throughout most of its length in  the isthmus, is at least 75 kilometers wide. The majority of the region  in the isthmus is drained by the Rio Coatzacoalcos, which flows in a  northerly course to the Gulf of Mexico. The western part is drained by  the Rio San Juan, the principal tributary of the Rio Papaloapan. Behind  the coastal dunes are frequent, and sometimes large, lagoons.  Immediately inland from Coatzacoalcos and along the lower stretches of  the Rio Papaloapan are extensive marshes. Essentially the entire  coastal plain, with the exception of the coastal dunes, consists of  rich alluvial deposits.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Vertical exaggeration approximately 165  times.]    The central ridges extend from the Rio Jaltepec southward to within 40  kilometers of the Pacific coast. It is in this area that the continuity  of the high ridges and volcanic peaks, which extend nearly the entire  length of the Americas, is interrupted at a point almost directly in  line with the shortest distance between the two oceans. The northern  part of this central region consists of hills dissected by tributaries  of the Rio Coatzacoalcos; the principal ones from north to south  are--Rio Jaltepec, Rio Tortuguero, Rio Sarabia, and Rio Malatengo. The  plains of Chivela are south of these rivers and lie at an elevation of  about 200 meters; at the southern edge of these plains a range of hills  rises to 250 to 400 meters above sea level. These hills drop abruptly  to the Plains of Tehuantepec. In the northern and central parts of this  central region the rocks are granitic; the hills to the south of the  Plains of Chivela are limestone.    The Pacific Coastal Plain or Plains of Tehuantepec have a maximum width  of about 30 kilometers. From the base of the hills at an elevation of  about 75 meters the plains slope gradually to the sea. To the west of  the Rio Tehuantepec and to the east of the Plains of Tehuantepec at the  base of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the coastal plain becomes much  narrower; in these places the continuity of the plain is frequently  interrupted by low north-south ridges extending outward from the  mountains or by isolated hills. The soil is poor, varying from volcanic  rock to gravel and sand.      _Climate_    The prevailing winds are from the north across the Gulf of Mexico.  These moisture-laden winds precipitate most of their moisture north of  the central ridges. This results in high rainfall on the northern  slopes and Gulf Coastal Plain and relatively little rainfall on the  southern slopes and the Pacific Coastal Plain. Precipitation is cyclic;  there is a marked wet and a dry season throughout the region, but this  is most noticeable on the Pacific lowlands (Fig. 3). At Salina Cruz on  the Pacific Ocean the average annual rainfall is 1040 mm. (Contreras,  1942); of this amount, only 15 mm. falls from November through April.  On the Gulf Coastal Plain (Minatitlan station) the average annual  rainfall is 3085 mm. In this region the driest months are February  through May, during which time 236 mm. of rain falls. At Salina Cruz  the wettest month is June; at Minatitlan it is September. There is  little variation in temperature throughout the isthmus; the average  annual temperature at Salina Cruz is 26.6 deg. C.; that at Minatitlan is  26.2 deg. C.

Whoever wishes to form an accurate idea of the power and might of the  British nation, and is desirous to discover the sources of the  all-important influence the \"island race\" exercise over the destinies of  humanity, should visit, not England, but her colonies in America, Africa,  Asia, and Australia. In these he will see in full and beneficial  operation, that system which one of the greatest of German political  economists, the ingenious Fredrick List, recommended more than thirty  years ago to the German Government, when he spoke of the serious detriment  the Northern country sustained year after year by the emigration _en  masse_ of skilled German labourers, and when he repeatedly urged to make  agriculture under the tropics reciprocally beneficial to the manufacturing  industry of the temperate zone.[1]    England has comprehended better than Germany how to utilize the energies  of such of her children as emigrate to distant quarters of the globe, and  to make them subservient to her own advancement as well; she evinced the  most anxious solicitude for these pioneers of progress, extended her  protection to them, flung the aegis of her own power over their adopted  home, regarding each new settlement as but an extension of the limit of  her empire, as an enlargement of the sources whence she drew the materials  for her industrial handicrafts, as a new market for her manufactures! In  all parts of the inhabited earth English activity has thus displayed  itself, busily engaged in supplying the demand for raw materials in her  home market, by exchanging for them her own manufactures, till English  ships have become the all but universal carriers of the commerce of the  globe, while the English language has been adopted as the medium of  intercommunication of all seafarers.    Australia, or New Holland,[2] as it was originally termed by its first  discoverers, proud of their nationality, furnishes of all the British  colonies the most conspicuous and instructive example of this policy.  England has not merely thrown open this immense continent to European  civilization, peopled it with hundreds of thousands of her sons, and  created a new market for herself and all navigating nations,--she has also  in this colony furnished the solution of a psychological problem, namely,  that it is by no means an innate natural propensity to do evil, but rather  the force of circumstances which drives man to vice and crime, and that  the diviner portion of his nature forthwith re-asserts itself, so soon as  he is provided with another more favourable sphere of action, and a fair  opportunity is offered to him of earning his livelihood in an honourable,  independent manner by the free, unshackled development of his mental and  physical powers.    Originally founded as a penal settlement for convicts sentenced to  transportation for long periods of years, and in fact composed at first of  such unpromising elements, this splendid country is at present one of the  wealthiest and most important colonies of the British Crown, and close to  that spot where, on 28th January, 1788, 850 criminals were landed, there  to take up their involuntary abode, there now rises in one of the numerous  coves of the splendidly situate Bay of Port Jackson, a city of such  magnificence, so large and so beautiful, that it has been called the  \"Queen of the South,\" or even, with more enthusiasm than accuracy, \"Little  London.\" The population of the city and environs is estimated at 93,000,  that of this single colony at 350,000, while its trade has increased to  such an extent that it keeps employed 1000 ships and 18,000 men, the value  of exports of raw, and import of manufactured products, amounting for this  one port to upwards of L12,000,000 per annum. The discovery of abundant  gold-fields in the adjacent colony of Victoria has undoubtedly materially  contributed to this enormous expansion, and has perceptibly increased the  immigration, but the development of the capabilities of the land itself  has not been less steadily increasing, wherever the population have  pursued the surer and more solid occupation of agriculture and  cattle-rearing. The wool growth of Australia, which in 1820 was barely 50  tons, has since then risen to nearly 25,000 tons, rivalling in bulk and  quality that of the Cape, and rapidly becoming a dangerous competitor with  those countries of Europe, whose wools have hitherto commanded their own  terms in the English market.    A continent of such immeasurable natural resources, with a climate,[3]  especially on its southern coasts, remarkable for its mildness,  equability, and salubrity, and a population so limited[4] in proportion to  the extent of surface, was naturally an object of deep interest for the  members of the _Novara_ Expedition. Accordingly during their stay of  thirty-two days they set diligently to work, not only to enlarge their  acquaintance with the scientific idiosyncrasies of this vast portion of  the globe, but also to examine minutely the prospects it holds out to  German commerce and German emigration, and to investigate the influence  which has been exercised on the development of the colony by the system of  transporting convicts thither. And it is not less significant of the high  repute enjoyed by the Imperial Expedition in foreign countries, as  honourable to its members, to record, that the then Governor-General of  New South Wales, Sir William Denison, who has since been transferred to  the much more important and lucrative post of Governor of the Madras  Presidency, and who enjoys no slight reputation in scientific circles as a  conchyliologist, expressed his anxious desire that the geologist of the  _Novara_ should thoroughly examine the geological formation of the  province of Auckland in New Zealand, and exerted himself vigorously to  forward the accomplishment of this project.    From the German residents in Sydney, as well as from all the officials and  the inhabitants generally, we received the utmost assistance and most  cordial co-operation in our various inquiries. The former received the  Expedition with a most enthusiastic welcome, and it was truly gratifying  to learn that some of the more keenly susceptible of home-influences had  weeks before made the beach their favourite promenade, in order that they  might be the first to see and welcome the long-expected German man-of-war  at her arrival! The German newspaper \"_Australische Zeitung_\" (published  by a native of Graetz, named Degotardi) of November 6th was quite filled  with advertisements and notices relating to the _Novara_, and the  festivities which had been prepared in her honour. Every member of the  staff received a copy on board, so that before even we set foot on shore,  we were apprized of the old German hospitality which awaited us on our  arrival in this the fifth quarter of the globe. As, however, it was  imperatively necessary to have the frigate taken to the Government dock,  in order to repair the damages she sustained in the typhoon, the  contemplated rejoicings had to stand over for the moment, till the  _Novara_ could come forth in renewed splendour, and was fit to give a  proper reception to the homage intended to be offered in her honour. These  rather extensive repairs would require three weeks to complete, and"]]]
