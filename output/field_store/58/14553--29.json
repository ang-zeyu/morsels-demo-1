James Russell Lowell.          THE ICE KING    (Indian Legend)      Once upon a time there was an Indian village built on the bank of a  wide river. During the spring, summer, and autumn the people were very  happy. There was plenty of fuel and game in the deep woods; the river  afforded excellent fish. But the Indians dreaded the months when the  Ice King reigned.    One winter the weather was terribly cold and the people suffered  severely. The Ice King called forth the keen wind from the northern  sky, and piled the snowdrifts so high in the forests that it was most  difficult to supply the wigwams with game. He covered the river with  ice so thick that the Indians feared it would never melt.    \"When will the Ice King leave us?\" they asked each other. \"We shall  all perish if he continues his cruel reign.\"    At last signs of spring encouraged the stricken people. The great  snowdrifts in the forests disappeared and the ice on the river broke  into large pieces. All of these floated downstream except one huge  cake which lodged on the bank very near the village. And when the  Indians saw that the spring sunshine did not melt this great mass of  ice they were puzzled and anxious.    \"It is the roof of the Ice King's lodge,\" they said. \"We shall never  enjoy warm weather while he dwells near us. Have we no brave who is  willing to do battle with this winter tyrant?\"    At last, a courageous young hunter armed himself with a huge club and  went forth to see if he could shatter the glittering frozen mass and  rid the village of the giant who dwelt beneath it. With all his  strength he struck the ice roof blow upon blow, crying out, \"Begone, O  cruel Ice King! Your time is past! Begone!\"    Finally, there was a deafening noise like the crashing of forest trees  when the lightning strikes, and the huge ice cake split into several  pieces.    \"Begone!\" cried the young brave, as he struggled with each great lump  of ice until he pushed it from the bank and tumbled it into the river  below.    And when the mighty task was finished the white figure of the Ice King  stood before the Indian brave.    \"You have ruined my lodge,\" said the giant.    \"The winter season is past,\" answered the brave. \"Begone!\"    \"After several moons I shall return to stay,\" threatened the Ice King.  Then he stalked away toward the North.    The people were very happy when they knew that the young brave had  conquered the giant; but their joy was somewhat dampened when they  heard about the threatened return of the Ice King.    \"I shall prepare for his return and do battle with him again,\"  declared the Indian conqueror.    This promise comforted the people somewhat, but still they thought of  the coming winter with dread.    During the autumn the hunter built near the river a strong wigwam and  stored therein abundant fuel and dried game. He filled many bags made  of skin, with oil, which he procured from the animals he killed. Also,  he was well supplied with fur rugs, blankets, and warm clothes.    At last the winter season came. The cold north wind blew unceasingly,  the snow piled high around the wigwams; ice several feet thick covered  the river.    \"The Ice King has come,\" said the Indians. \"If he keeps his threat to  stay among us we shall surely perish.\"    One bitter cold day the young Indian who had prepared well for the  severe weather sat in his wigwam near a blazing fire. Suddenly, a  strong gust of wind tore aside the bear skin which protected the  doorway and into the lodge stalked the Ice King. His freezing breath  filled the place and dampened the fire. He took a seat opposite the  Indian brave who said, \"Welcome, Ice King.\"    \"I've come to stay,\" answered the giant.    The Indian shivered with cold at the sudden change of temperature in  his wigwam, but he rose and brought more logs to the fire. Also, he  opened one of his bags of oil and poured the contents on the great  pieces of wood. The flames soon caught the oil-soaked logs and a  roaring fire crackled and blazed in the wigwam. More and more fuel the  young brave piled on his fire until finally the frosty cold air was  changed to summer heat.    The Ice King shifted his seat away from the glowing fire. Farther and  farther away he pushed until he sat with his back against the wall of  the wigwam. As he moved he seemed to grow smaller and weaker. The icy  feathers of his headgear drooped about his forehead and great drops of  sweat covered his face. But still the Indian brave piled fuel on the  blazing fire.    \"Spare me, O hunter,\" cried the Ice King.    But to the words of the giant the young Indian was deaf. He opened  another bag of oil and poured it on the logs.    \"Have mercy, I beg you!\" pleaded the Ice King. He rose and staggered  toward the door.    \"You have conquered me,\" he said in a weak voice. \"I will depart.  Twice you have won a victory over me. I give up my hope of reigning  continually among your people. My season shall last during three  moons, only.\"    He staggered out of the wigwam and stalked wearily away. Since that  day the giant Ice King has not tried to reign throughout the year.          A SONG OF THE SNOW          Sing, Ho, a song of the winter dawn,      When the air is still and the clouds are gone,      And the snow lies deep on hill and lawn,          And the old clock ticks, \"'Tis time! 'Tis time!\"      And the household rises with many a yawn      Sing, Ho, a song of the winter dawn!              Sing, Ho!

Sing, Ho!        Sing, Ho, a song of the winter day,      When ermine capped are the stocks of hay,      And the wood-smoke pillars the air with gray,          And the old clock ticks, \"To work! To work!\"      And the goodwife sings as she churns away      Sing, Ho, a song of the winter day!              Sing, Ho!                            Madison Cawein.          KING FROST AND KING WINTER    Margaret T. Canby      King Winter lives in a very strong palace near the cold North Pole; it  is built of great blocks of thick ice, and all around it stand high,  pointed icebergs, and cross, white bears keep guard at the gate. He  has many little fairy servants to do his bidding and they are like  their master, cross and spiteful, and seldom do any kind actions, so  that few are found who love them. King Winter is rich and powerful,  but he keeps all his wealth so tightly locked up that it does no one  any good; and what is worse, he often tries to get the treasures of  other persons, to add to the store in his money chests.    One day when this selfish old king was walking through the woods he  saw the leaves thickly covered with gold and precious stones, which  had been spread upon them by King Frost, to make the trees more  beautiful and give pleasure to all who saw them. But looking at them  did not satisfy King Winter; he wanted to have the gold for his own,  and he made up his mind to get it, somehow. Back he went to his palace  to call his servants home to do this new work. As soon as he reached  the gate, he blew a loud, shrill note on his horn and in a few minutes  his odd little fairies came flying in at the windows and doors and  stood before him quietly waiting their commands. The king ordered some  to go out into the forest, at nightfall, armed with canes and clubs,  and beat off all the gold and ruby leaves; and he told others to take  strong bags, and gather up all the treasure, and bring it to him.    \"If that silly King Frost does not think any more of gold and precious  stones than to waste them on trees I shall teach him better,\" said the  old king.    The fairies promised to obey him, and as soon as night came, off they  rushed to the forest, and a terrible noise they made, flying from one  beautiful tree to another, banging and beating the leaves off.  Branches were cracking and falling on all sides, and leaves were  flying about, while the sound of shouting and laughing and screaming  told all who heard it that the spiteful winter fairies were at some  mischief. The other fairies followed, and gathered up the poor  shattered leaves, cramming them into the great bags they had brought,  and taking them to King Winter's palace as fast as they were filled.    This work was kept up nearly all night and when morning came, the  magic forest of many-colored leaves was changed into a dreary place.  Bare trees stretched their long brown branches around and seemed to  shiver in the cold wind and to sigh for the beautiful dress of shining  leaves so rudely torn from them.    King Winter was very much pleased, as one great sack after another was  tugged in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34579"],[0,"Bees from British Guiana (#2)"],[1,"has five linear  red bands on abdomen, but in another the bands are very indistinct,  almost obsolete.    #Melipona intermixta# Cockerell.--The ground color of the first three  abdominal tergites varies; in the lighter forms that of the first is  pale fulvous with the shoulders blackish, of the second and third clear  ferruginous.    #Euglossa singularis# Mocsary.--Judging from the brief description, it  appears that #E. meliponoides# Ducke is probably the same species.      #Euglossa decorata# Smith, var. #ruficauda#, new variety    Both sexes with abdomen ferruginous, apically more or less dusky, but  the whole effect lighter and redder than typical; scutellum green with  the hind margin red. Tuft on female scutellum light fulvous. The female,  from Kalacoon, (Hym. 212) is the type of the variety.      #Euglossa ignita# Smith, var. #chlorosoma#, new variety    Green, without coppery tints, but variably suffused with purple. It is  smaller than _E. piliventris_, with shorter mouth-parts, and the labrum  pallid with a pair of dusky spots. A male in the U. S. Nat. Museum from  Bartica, which I reported as _E. piliventris_, belongs here. Female _E.  piliventris_ has long yellow hairs on the anterior margin of hind  basitarsus, but in _chlorosoma_ the hair in this situation is black. The  type of the variety is a female labelled Hym. 140. A female from  Kalacoon has brassy and coppery tints on the apical part of abdomen, and  must be referred to _E. ignita_ proper. The type locality of _ignita_ is  Jamaica.    #Ceratina laeta# Spinola. This was described from the female. The  specimen sent is a male, and differs from the female in being smaller,  and having a transverse band on anterior margin of clypeus, triangular  marks on lower corners of face, and a large patch (emarginate above) on  labrum all ivory-white. This is very like _C. viridula_ Smith, which  Ducke considers a synonym of _laeta_, but the base of the metathorax  seems to differ, and the nervures are piceous. For the present,  therefore, I retain _C. viridula_ as a distinct species. The female of  _C. viridula_, collected by Busck in the Panama Canal Zone, is also  distinguishable from that sex of _C. laeta_.      #Epicharis maculata# var. #barticana#, new variety    [Female].--Base of mandibles with a large cuneiform yellow mark; a broad  black band down each side of labrum; yellow spots on prothorax large;  scutellum with a pair of large transversely oval yellow areas, separated  by a narrow black band; band on second abdominal segment with a  posterior median projection. Kalacoon, 1916. (Hym. 217.)      #Rhathymus beebei#, new species    [Female].--Length about 22 mm., anterior wing 18 mm.; head clear  ferruginous, with red hair, lower part of face more pallid, with a  creamy tint; apical half of mandibles black; clypeus prominent, minutely  roughened, with a smooth median line; mesothorax black, with a median  ridge, the surface on each side of this strongly punctured, but shining  between the punctures; rest of thorax ferruginous, and all of thorax  with ferruginous hair; scutellum not bigibbous, but with an elevated  transverse ridge; pleura with a blackish area below the wings; lower  part of mesopleura with a shining tubercle; tegulae clear ferruginous,  finely punctured; wings strongly reddened; legs clear ferruginous;  abdomen fusiform, shining; first two segments dull reddish, pallid  posterolaterally, the others reddish black, with the hind margins  redder; apical plate very large, concave. Bartica District (Hym. 19).  Very distinct by the transverse straight ridge on scutellum; nearest  perhaps to the considerably smaller _R. unicolor_ Smith, but that has  dark fuscous wings. The antennae are unfortunately missing.      #Augochlora callichlorura#, new species    [Female].--Length a little over 7 mm.; first two abdominal segments  rather weakly vibrissate on hind margin with orange hairs; hind spur of  hind leg with long spines. Head and thorax very dark purplish, nearly  black, but a blue-green spot at upper end of clypeus, supraclypeal area  brilliant purple, and base of metathorax strongly tinged with purple;  anterior and middle legs dark, with weak purple tints, but hind femora,  tibiae and basal half of basitarsi all brilliant green on outer side;  abdomen short and broad, shining, very brilliant emerald green. Head  broad, eyes strongly converging below; clypeus with extremely large  punctures; front dull and granular; ocelli ordinary; cheeks with thin  white hair; mesothorax and scutellum shining, but well punctured; base  of metathorax with strong short plicae; angles of prothorax not  prominent; tegulae rufotestaceous; wings grayish translucent, stigma and  nervures dusky pale brown; first recurrent nervure meeting second  transversocubital; abdomen with thin pale hair, hind margins of segments  not darkened. Bartica District.    Unique by the combination of purplish head and thorax and green abdomen,  the general effect recalling _A. atropos_ Smith.      #Florilegus barticanus#, new species.    [Male].--Length about 11 mm.; black, except as follows: first abdominal  segment strongly greenish; clypeus and labrum entirely yellow; mandibles  fulvous apically (but base black); antennae, except the first two joints,  ferruginous beneath; hind tarsi, and apex of hind tibiae, dusky red; hair  of head and thorax ferruginous, paler below, no admixture of dark hairs;  eyes reddish; mesothorax shining, but distinctly punctured; tegulae clear  ferruginous; wings dusky hyaline, nervures reddish fuscous; legs with  pale hair, conspicuously plumose on hind tibiae; abdomen with four broad  dense ochraceous hair-bands, that on fourth segment broadly excavated in  middle posteriorly, on fifth broadly interrupted; sixth segment with a  small patch of fulvous hair on each side; apical part of abdomen  dorsally, except for the bands and patches, with very dark fuscous hair.  Bartica District (Hym. 11).    Related to _F. lanieri_ Guer. from Cuba and _F. condigna_ Cresson from  the United States. In the coloration of the legs it is intermediate  between these two.    #Tetrapedia lacteipennis# Vachal.--It should be added to Vachal's  description, that the dorsal abdominal segments 2 to 4 have yellow  bands.    The Bartica collection contains a _Megalopta_ from Hoorie, but it is  unfortunately broken. I have _Megalopta panamensis_ Cockerell from  Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Museum, 42).    I add the description of a new species from French Guiana, the type of  which is in my collection.      #Augochlora maroniana#, new species    [Female].--Length slightly over 8 mm.; head, thorax and legs bright  green; abdomen yellowish green strongly suffused with coppery, the first  two segments with apical fringes of orange hair; face rather narrow;  antennae black; lower middle of clypeus black; mesothorax and scutellum  rough with dense punctatures, the scutellum with two copper-red spots;  area of metathorax with very feeble plicae; tegulae black with pallid  margin, the basal side broadly green; wings dusky; second s. m. square;  first r. n. meeting second t. c; stigma dusky reddish; legs with mainly  pale hair, hind tibiae with dark hair on outer side basally; hind spur  with about six long spines; basal half of basitarsi green on outer side;  abdomen shining, with pale ochreus hair.    Maroni, French Guiana (Queensland Mus., 43). Related to _A. cupreola_  (Ckll.), but with the vibrissate fringes on abdomen nearly twice as  long, and deep orange-fulvous, and the mesothorax much more densely  punctured. Also related to _A. diversipennis_ (Lep.), but with the face  much narrower, and the area of metathorax much less distinctly plicate.  From _A. calypso_ Sm. it is known by the wings not being yellowish, the  inner orbits not edged with blue, and the tarsi not ferruginous.
