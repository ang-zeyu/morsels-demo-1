By the sixth resolution of this plan the national  legislature was to have the power of negativing all state laws which,  in its opinion, contravened \"the Articles of Union, or any treaty  subsisting under the authority of the Union,\" and by the eighth  resolution \"a convenient number of the national judiciary\" were to be  associated with the Executive, \"with authority to examine every act of  the national legislature before it shall operate, and every act of a  particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final\" and to  impose a qualified veto in either case.    But, as discussion in the Convention proceeded, three principles  obtained clearer and clearer recognition, if not from all its members,  certainly from the great majority of them: first, that the Constitution  is law, in the sense of being enforcible by courts; secondly, that it  is supreme law, with which ordinary legislation must be in harmony to  be valid; and thirdly--a principle deducible from the doctrine of the  separation of powers--that, while the function of making new law belongs  to the legislative branch of the Government, that of expounding the  standing law, of which the Constitution would be part and parcel,  belongs to the Judiciary. The final disposition of the question of  insuring the conformity of ordinary legislation to the Constitution  turned to no small extent on the recognition of these three great  principles.    The proposal to endow Congress with the power to negative state  legislation having been rejected by the Convention, Luther Martin of  Maryland moved that \"the legislative acts of the United States made in  virtue and in pursuance of the Articles of Union, and all treaties  made or ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the  supreme law of the respective States, and the judiciaries of the several  States shall be bound thereby in their decisions, anything in  the respective laws of the individual States to the contrary  notwithstanding.\" The motion was agreed to without a dissenting voice  and, with some slight changes, became Article VIII of the report of  the Committee of Detail of the 7th of August, which in turn became \"the  linch-pin of the Constitution.\" * Then, on the 27th of August, it was  agreed that \"the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court\" should \"extend to  all cases arising under the laws passed by the Legislature of the United  States,\" whether, that is, such laws should be in pursuance of the  Constitution or not. The foundation was thus laid for the Supreme  Court to claim the right to review any state decision challenging on  constitutional grounds the validity of any act of Congress. Presently  this foundation was broadened by the substitution of the phrase  \"judicial power of the United States\" for the phrase \"jurisdiction  of the Supreme Court,\" and also by the insertion of the words \"this  Constitution\" and \"the\" before the word \"laws\" in what ultimately became  Article III of the Constitution. The implications of the phraseology of  this part of the Constitution are therefore significant:         * Article VI, paragraph 2.      Section I. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in  one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from  time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the Supreme and  inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and  shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which  shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.    Section II. 1. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and  equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States,  and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all  cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all  cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which  the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more  States, between a State and citizens of another State, between citizens  of different States, between citizens of the same State claiming lands  under grants of different States, and between a State, or the citizens  thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.      Such, then, is the verbal basis of the power of the courts, and  particularly of the Supreme Court, to review the legislation of any  State, with reference to the Constitution, to acts of Congress, or to  treaties of the United States. Nor can there be much doubt that the  members of the Convention were also substantially agreed that the  Supreme Court was endowed with the further right to pass upon the  constitutionality of acts of Congress. The available evidence strictly  contemporaneous with the framing and ratification of the Constitution  shows us seventeen of the fifty-five members of the Convention asserting  the existence of this prerogative in unmistakable terms and only three  using language that can be construed to the contrary. More striking  than that, however, is the fact that these seventeen names include fully  three-fourths of the leaders of the Convention, four of the five members  of the Committee of Detail which drafted the Constitution, and four of  the five members of the Committee of Style which gave the Constitution  its final form. And these were precisely the members who expressed  themselves on all the interesting and vital subjects before the  Convention, because they were its statesmen and articulate members. *         * The entries under the names of these members in the Index       to Max Farrand's \"Records of the Federal Convention\" occupy       fully thirty columns, as compared with fewer than half as       many columns under the names of all remaining members.      No part of the Constitution has realized the hopes of its framers more  brilliantly than has Article III, where the judicial power of the United  States is defined and organized, and no part has shown itself to be more  adaptable to the developing needs of a growing nation. Nor is the reason  obscure: no part came from the hands of the framers in more fragmentary  shape or left more to the discretion of Congress and the Court.    Congress is thus placed under constitutional obligation to establish  one Supreme Court, but the size of that Court is for Congress itself to  determine, as well as whether there shall be any inferior Federal Courts  at all. What, it may be asked, is the significance of the word \"shall\"  in Section II? Is it merely permissive or is it mandatory? And, in  either event, when does a case arise under the Constitution or the  laws of the United States? Here, too, are questions which are left for  Congress in the first instance and for the Supreme Court in the last.  Further, the Supreme Court is given \"original jurisdiction\" in certain  specified cases and \"appellate jurisdiction\" in all others--subject,  however, to \"such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress  shall make.\" Finally, the whole question of the relation of the national  courts to the state judiciaries, though it is elaborately discussed  by Alexander Hamilton in the \"Federalist,\" is left by the Constitution  itself to the practically undirected wisdom of Congress, in the exercise  of its power to pass \"all laws which shall be necessary and proper  for carrying into execution\" * its own powers and those of the other  departments of the Government.        * Article I, section VIII, 18.      Almost the first official act of the Senate of the United States,  after it had perfected its own organization, was the appointment of a  committee \"to bring in a bill for organizing the judiciary of the  United States.\" This committee consisted of eight members, five of  whom, including Oliver Ellsworth, its chairman, had been members of  the Federal Convention. To Ellsworth is to be credited largely the  authorship of the great Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, the  essential features of which still remain after 130 years in full force  and effect.    This famous measure created a chief justiceship and five associate  justiceships for the Supreme Court; fifteen District Courts, one for  each State of the Union and for each of the two Territories, Kentucky  and Ohio; and, to stand between these, three Circuit Courts consisting  of two Supreme Court justices and the local district judge. The \"cases\"  and \"controversies\" comprehended by the Act fall into three groups:  first, those brought to enforce the national laws and treaties, original  jurisdiction of which was assigned to the District Courts; secondly,  controversies between citizens of different States *; lastly, cases  brought originally under a state law and in a State Court but  finally coming to involve some claim of right based on the National  Constitution, laws, or treaties. For these the twenty-fifth section of  the Act provided that, where the decision of the highest State Court  competent under the state law to pass upon the case was adverse to the  claim thus set up, an appeal on the issue should lie to the Supreme  Court. This twenty-fifth section received the hearty approval of the  champions of State Rights, though later on it came to be to them an  object of fiercest resentment. In the Senate, as in the Convention,  the artillery of these gentlemen was trained upon the proposed inferior  Federal Judiciary, which they pictured as a sort of Gargantua ready at  any moment \"to swallow up the state courts.\"         * Where the national jurisdiction was extended to these in       the interest of providing an impartial tribunal, it was       given to the Circuit Court.      The first nominations for the Supreme Court were sent in by Washington  two days after he had signed the Judiciary Act. As finally constituted,  the original bench consisted of John Jay of New"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#2)"],[1,"ck; but he knew that they were not following  the precise line by which they came.    It was now nearly dark.  The snow was falling thicker than ever, and the  ground, except upon the uplands exposed to the full force of the wind,  was covered with a white mantle.    On arriving at the bottom of a steep hill, they stopped again.    \"Do you know where we are, Tom?\"    \"Not in the least,\" Tom answered.    \"This ought to be the last valley,\" Dick said, \"and after one more climb  we ought to go straight down into Castleton.  Don't you remember in that  valley there were a lot of sheep in a fold, with a wall round it?  If we  can find that, we shall know that we are right.  It is near the bottom,  so we shall not miss it.  Which way shall we turn, left or right?\"    \"Let us try the left first,\" Tom said.    They walked for half a mile, gradually ascending.    \"It is not this way,\" Tom said at last.  \"We are getting to the head of  the valley.  What are you doing, James?\" as the young boy, who had been  sobbing for some time, threw himself on the snow.    \"I cannot go any farther,\" he murmured.  \"I am so cold, and so tired,  and so sleepy.\"    \"Oh, nonsense!\"  Dick said.  \"Here, take hold of his arm, Tom, and lift  him up; give him a good shake; he must go on; he would die if he stopped  here.\"    The two lads raised the younger boy, and half-supporting half-dragging  him turned and retraced their footsteps.    It was pitch dark now, and they could not see a yard before them.  For  some time they continued their way.    \"There is no shepherd's hut.  Certainly, this is not the valley.  What  on earth are we to do?\"    \"I don't know,\" Tom said, beginning to cry.    \"Shut up, Tom Jackson.  What are you thinking about?  This is no time  for howling like a baby; you have got to think of what is best to do.  It is no use climbing the next hill, for we might be going away from  home, instead of getting nearer.  Besides, we should have to haul Jimmy  up, for he can scarcely stand now; and, although it is bitterly cold  here, it would be worse on the top of the hill.  No, we have got to step  here all night, that is clear.\"    \"We shall be dead before morning!\"  Tom roared.    \"I will hit you in the eye, Tom Jackson, if you don't shut up; you are  as bad as a girl; I am ashamed of you.  Now, what we have got to do, is  to find some sort of shelter, either a wall or bush, and we must keep on  until we come to something.  Keep awake, Jimmy; we shan't have much  farther to go, and then you can lie down quietly.\"    They went on for a bit.    \"It is no use,\" Dick said.  \"They don't put walls across bottoms; more  likely to find one either to the right or left.  Now, Tom, you stop here  for a minute or two, and I will look about; you keep shouting every  minute, so that I can find my way back to you.\"    Turning off, he began to ascend the next hill, and in two or three  minutes shouted the glad news to Tom that he had found the wall; then he  returned.    Jimmy, cheered at the prospect of lying down, made an effort, and they  soon reached the wall.    Like most of the walls in Derbyshire, it was formed of flat stones laid  without mortar, some four feet high.    \"Now, Tom, set to work; get some stones off the wall on both sides, and  build up two other walls against this; three feet wide inside will do,  and just long enough to lie in.  Here, Jimmy, you help; it will keep you  awake, and, you see, the higher we make the walls the snugger it will  be; we will have quite a nice house.\"    The boys all set to work, and in half an hour three walls were built.  At the point where the two side walls touched the other, they were three  feet high, and sloped down to two at the lower end.    \"Now, Jimmy, you chuck the snow out.  Tom and I will go, one each way,  along the wall; likely enough we may come upon some bushes--they often  grow in shelter of the walls: if we can find a few sticks we will cover  the house over.  Lots of these stones are a couple of feet long, and we  will manage a sort of roof.  The snow will soon cover it, and we shall  be as warm as possible.\"    A quarter of an hour later the two boys returned; both had been  successful and brought a bundle of sticks; these were laid across the  top, interspersed with smaller twigs, the ends being kept down with  stones to prevent their being blown away.  The last were placed in  position after the boys had crept inside.  They did not attempt to roof  it with stones, for the supply of sticks and brushwood was large enough  to catch the snow-flakes as they fell, and these would soon form a  covering, while it would have been difficult to balance the stones.    Jimmy was by this time in a state almost of lethargy; but the others  were fairly warm from their exertions.  They now lay down close beside  the younger boy, one on each side.  At first they felt the cold  extremely.    \"Let us keep awake as long as we can,\" Dick said.    \"I don't feel inclined to sleep at all,\" Tom answered; \"my hands and  feet feel frozen, but I am warm enough everywhere else, and the ground  is precious hard and bumpy.\"    \"I am only afraid about Jimmy,\" Dick said; \"he is sound asleep, and he  was so awfully cold; lie as close as you can to him, Tom, and put your  arm over him and keep your legs huddled up against his.\"    \"It feels warmer than it did,\" he went on, after a pause of half an  hour; \"don't you think so, Tom?\"    \"A lot warmer,\" Tom said.  \"I expect the snow has made a good thick  roof.\"    \"Yes, and the wind does not blow through the stones as it did.  I expect  the snow is drifting up all round; it was getting very deep against the  wall when we got in, and if it goes on all night, Tom, I should not  wonder if we are covered deep before morning.  The wind always sweeps it  off the hills, and makes deep drifts in the bottoms.\"    \"What shall we do, then?\"    \"I don't know,\" Dick answered; \"but there will be plenty of time to  think of that in the morning.  I think Jimmy is all right, Tom; I have  just put my hand inside his waistcoat and he feels quite warm now.  Say  your prayers, and then let us try to get off to sleep.\"    This they were not very long in doing, for the air in the little hut was  soon heated by the action of their bodies.  Outside the storm was still  raging, and the wind, laden with swirling snow from the uplands, was  piling it high in the valleys.  Already the hut was covered and the wall  behind it.    All night and all next day the snow continued to fall; the next day, and  the next, it kept on.  Old folks down in Castleton said they never  remembered such a storm.  It lay three feet deep in the fields, and  there was no saying how deep the drifts might be in the hollows.  For  the first two days the wind had tried its best to keep the hills clear,  but it had tired of the work, and for the last two had ceased to blow,  and the great feathered flakes formed steadily and silently.    Tom was the first to wake.    \"Holloa!\" he exclaimed, \"where are we?  Oh!  I remember.  Dick, are you  awake?\"    \"Yes, I am awake now,\" Dick said.  \"What is it?  It is not morning yet.  I seem to have been asleep a long time, and don't my bones just ache?  Jimmy, old boy, are you all right?\"    \"Yes,\" Jimmy grunted.    \"It is quite warm,\" Dick said.  \"It feels very close, and how still it  is!  The wind has quite gone down.  Do you know, Tom, I think it must be  morning.  There seems a faint sort of light.  I can see the stones in  the wall behind you.\"    \"So it must,\" Tom assented.  \"Oh! how stifling it is!\" and he raised  himself into a sitting position.    \"I am afraid we are buried deep in the snow-drift.  Put your hand up,  Tom; don't you feel some of these sticks are bent in the middle?\"    \"Ever so much; there must be a great weight on them.  What are we to do,  Dick; shall we try and dig a way out?\"    \"That will be no good,\" Dick answered; \"not if it is deep; and if it has  been snowing all night, there is no saying how deep it may be this  morning down in this bottom.  This drift-snow is like dust.  I remember  last winter that Bill Jones and Harry Austin and I tried to make a  tunnel in a deep drift, but the snow fell in as fast as we scraped it  away.  It was just like dry sand.\"    \"We are all right for warmth,\" Tom said; \"but it feels quite stifling.\"    \"Yes, we must try and get some air,\" Dick said.  \"The roof-sticks are  close together down at our feet.  There were three or four left over  when we had finished, so we can take them away without weakening the  roof.  We might shove one of them up through the snow.\"    The sticks were removed carefully, but a quantity of fine snow fell in  on their feet.  One was then shoved up through the top, but the only  effect, when it was removed, was that it was followed by some snow  powdering down on their faces.    \"Let us tie four of them together,\" Dick said.  \"I have plenty of string  in my pocket.\"    This was done, fresh sticks being tied to the bottom as the first were  shoved up through the snow.    \"Now, Tom, help me to work it about a bit, so as to press the snow all  round, and make a sort of tube.\"    For some time a shower of little particles fell as they worked, but  gradually these ceased.  Then the stick was cautiously lowered, being  untied joint by joint, and looking up the boys gave a shout of pleasure.  At the top of the hole, which was some six inches wide at the bottom,  was a tiny patch of light.    \"We have only just reached the top,\" Dick said; \"the snow must be near  fifteen feet deep.\"    Small though the aperture was, it effected a sensible relief.  The  feeling of oppression ceased; half an hour later the hole was closed up,  and they knew that the snow was still falling.    Another length of stick was added, and the daylight again appeared.    The boys slept a good deal; they had no sensation of cold whatever, the  heat of their bodies keeping the air at a comfortable temperature.  They  did not "]]]
