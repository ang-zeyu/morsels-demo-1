[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2376"],[0,"Up from Slavery: An Autobiography (#5)"],[1," not one, so far as  I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive  industry. The girls were not taught to cook, sew, or to take care of the  house. All of this was left to the slaves. The slaves, of course,  had little personal interest in the life of the plantation, and their  ignorance prevented them from learning how to do things in the most  improved and thorough manner. As a result of the system, fences were  out of repair, gates were hanging half off the hinges, doors creaked,  window-panes were out, plastering had fallen but was not replaced, weeds  grew in the yard. As a rule, there was food for whites and blacks, but  inside the house, and on the dining-room table, there was wanting that  delicacy and refinement of touch and finish which can make a home the  most convenient, comfortable, and attractive place in the world. Withal  there was a waste of food and other materials which was sad. When  freedom came, the slaves were almost as well fitted to begin life anew  as the master, except in the matter of book-learning and ownership of  property. The slave owner and his sons had mastered no special industry.  They unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not  the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases,  had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling,  to labour.    Finally the war closed, and the day of freedom came. It was a momentous  and eventful day to all upon our plantation. We had been expecting it.  Freedom was in the air, and had been for months. Deserting soldiers  returning to their homes were to be seen every day. Others who had been  discharged, or whose regiments had been paroled, were constantly passing  near our place. The \"grape-vine telegraph\" was kept busy night and day.  The news and mutterings of great events were swiftly carried from one  plantation to another. In the fear of \"Yankee\" invasions, the silverware  and other valuables were taken from the \"big house,\" buried in the  woods, and guarded by trusted slaves. Woe be to any one who would have  attempted to disturb the buried treasure. The slaves would give the  Yankee soldiers food, drink, clothing--anything but that which had been  specifically intrusted to their care and honour. As the great day drew  nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It  was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the  verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. True, they  had sung those same verses before, but they had been careful to explain  that the \"freedom\" in these songs referred to the next world, and had  no connection with life in this world. Now they gradually threw off the  mask, and were not afraid to let it be known that the \"freedom\" in their  songs meant freedom of the body in this world. The night before the  eventful day, word was sent to the slave quarters to the effect that  something unusual was going to take place at the \"big house\" the next  morning. There was little, if any, sleep that night. All as excitement  and expectancy. Early the next morning word was sent to all the slaves,  old and young, to gather at the house. In company with my mother,  brother, and sister, and a large number of other slaves, I went to  the master's house. All of our master's family were either standing or  seated on the veranda of the house, where they could see what was to  take place and hear what was said. There was a feeling of deep interest,  or perhaps sadness, on their faces, but not bitterness. As I now recall  the impression they made upon me, they did not at the moment seem to be  sad because of the loss of property, but rather because of parting with  those whom they had reared and who were in many ways very close to them.  The most distinct thing that I now recall in connection with the scene  was that some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer,  I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper--the  Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that  we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother,  who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while  tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all  meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but  fearing that she would never live to see.    For some minutes there was great rejoicing, and thanksgiving, and wild  scenes of ecstasy. But there was no feeling of bitterness. In fact,  there was pity among the slaves for our former owners. The wild  rejoicing on the part of the emancipated coloured people lasted but for  a brief period, for I noticed that by the time they returned to their  cabins there was a change in their feelings. The great responsibility of  being free, of having charge of themselves, of having to think and plan  for themselves and their children, seemed to take possession of them. It  was very much like suddenly turning a youth of ten or twelve years  out into the world to provide for himself. In a few hours the great  questions with which the Anglo-Saxon race had been grappling for  centuries had been thrown upon these people to be solved. These were  the questions of a home, a living, the rearing of children, education,  citizenship, and the establishment and support of churches. Was it any  wonder that within a few hours the wild rejoicing ceased and a feeling  of deep gloom seemed to pervade the slave quarters? To some it seemed  that, now that they were in actual possession of it, freedom was a more  serious thing than they had expected to find it. Some of the slaves  were seventy or eighty years old; their best days were gone. They had  no strength with which to earn a living in a strange place and among  strange people, even if they had been sure where to find a new place of  abode. To this class the problem seemed especially hard. Besides, deep  down in their hearts there was a strange and peculiar attachment to \"old  Marster\" and \"old Missus,\" and to their children, which they found it  hard to think of breaking off. With these they had spent in some cases  nearly a half-century, and it was no light thing to think of parting.  Gradually, one by one, stealthily at first, the older slaves began  to wander from the slave quarters back to the \"big house\" to have a  whispered conversation with their former owners as to the future.        Chapter II. Boyhood Days    After the coming of freedom there were two points upon which practically  all the people on our place were agreed, and I found that this was  generally true throughout the South: that they must change their names,  and that they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or  weeks in order that they might really feel sure that they were free.    In some way a feeling got among the coloured people that it was far from  proper for them to bear the surname of their former owners, and a great  many of them took other surnames. This was one of the first signs of  freedom. When they were slaves, a coloured person was simply called  \"John\" or \"Susan.\" There was seldom occasion for more than the use of  the one name. If \"John\" or \"Susan\" belonged to a white man by the  name of \"Hatcher,\" sometimes he was called \"John Hatcher,\" or as  often \"Hatcher's John.\" But there was a feeling that \"John Hatcher\" or  \"Hatcher's John\" was not the proper title by which to denote a freeman;  and so in many cases \"John Hatcher\" was changed to \"John S. Lincoln\" or  \"John S. Sherman,\" the initial \"S\" standing for no name, it being simply  a part of what the coloured man proudly called his \"entitles.\"    As I have stated, most of the coloured people left the old plantation  for a short while at least, so as to be sure, it seemed, that they  could leave and try their freedom on to see how it felt. After they  had remained away for a while, many of the older slaves, especially,  returned to their old homes and made some kind of contract with their  former owners by which they remained on the estate.    My mother's husband, who was the stepfather of my brother John and  myself, did not belong to the same owners as did my mother. In fact, he  seldom came to our plantation. I remember seeing him there perhaps once  a year, that being about Christmas time. In some way, during the war, by  running away and following the Federal soldiers, it seems, he found  his way into the new state of West Virginia. As soon as freedom was  declared, he sent for my mother to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West  Virginia. At that time a journey from Virginia over the mountains  to West Virginia was rather a tedious and in some cases a painful  undertaking. What little clothing and few household goods we had were  placed in a cart, but the children walked the greater portion of the  distance, which was several hundred miles.    I do not think any of us ever had been very far from the plantation, and  the taking of a long journey into another state was quite an event. The  parting from our former owners and the members of our own race on the  plantation was a serious occasion. From the time of our parting till  their death we kept up a correspondence with the older members of the  family, and in later years we have kept in touch with those who were the  younger members. We were several weeks making the trip, and most of  the time we slept in the open air and did our cooking over a log fire  out-of-doors. One night I recall that we camped near an abandoned log  cabin, and my mother decided to build a fire in that for cooking, and  afterward to make a \"pallet\" on the floor for our sleeping. Just as the  fire had gotten well started a large black snake fully a yard and a half  long dropped down the chimney and ran out on the floor. Of course we at  once abandoned that cabin. Finally we reached our destination--a little  town called Malden, which is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23770"],[0,"Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 1 (#5)"],[1,"  full width of the sides, since the edges of the shelves are to be faced  with leather. Make each shelf 1/2 in. less than the width of the side,  at the place that the shelf is to be fastened.    The top will be squared up in the usual manner, 15 in. wide by 16 in.  long.    These parts may now be put together. They may be fastened in any one of  a variety of ways. Round-head blued screws may be placed at regular  intervals through the sides. Finishing nails may be used and the heads  set and covered with putty stained to match the wood. Finish nails may  be placed at regular intervals and fancy headed nails used to cover the  heads.    [Illustration: Details of the Magazine Stand]    The braces should be formed and fitted but not fastened until the finish  has been applied. Thoroughly scrape and sandpaper all parts not already  so treated. Probably no other finish appeals to so many people as golden  oak. There is no fixed standard of color for golden oak. Different  manufacturers have set standards in their part of the country, but the  prevailing idea of golden oak is usually that of a rich reddish brown.    Proceed as follows: Egg shell gloss: 1.--One coat of golden oak water  stain, diluted with water if a light golden is desired. 2.--Allow time  to dry, then sandpaper lightly with fine sandpaper. This is to smooth  the grain and to bring up the high lights by removing the stain from the  wood. Use No. 00 sandpaper and hold it on the finger tips. 3.--Apply a  second coat of the stain diluted about one-half with water. This will  throw the grain into still higher relief and thus produce a still  greater contrast. Apply this coat of stain very sparingly, using a rag.  Should this stain raise the grain, again rub lightly with fine worn  sandpaper, just enough to smooth. 4.--When this has dried, put on a  light coat of thin shellac. Shellac precedes filling that it may prevent  the high lights--the solid parts of the wood--from being discolored by  the stain in the filler, and thus causing a muddy effect. The shellac  being thin does not interfere with the filler's entering the pores of  the open grain. 5.--Sand lightly with fine sandpaper. 6.--Fill with  paste filler colored to match the stain. 7.--Cover this with a coat of  orange shellac. This coat of shellac might be omitted, but another coat  of varnish must be added. 8.--Sandpaper lightly. 9.--Apply two or three  coats of varnish. 10.--Rub the first coats with hair cloth or curled  hair and then with pulverized pumice stone, crude oil or linseed oil.  Affix the braces just after filling, using brads and puttying the holes  with putty colored to match the filler. The shelves may be faced with  thin leather harmonizing with the oak, ornamental headed tacks being  used to fasten it in place.          HOME-MADE LAWN SWING      [Illustration: The Completed Swing]    The coming of spring and summer calls forth various kinds of porch and  lawn furniture. A porch or lawn swing to accommodate two or more persons  is a thing desired by most people. The lawn swing as shown in the  picture is portable and does not need stakes to hold it to the ground.  While this swing is substantial and rigid it can be moved from place to  place on the lawn, or the chains can be fastened with heavy hooks to the  ceiling of a porch instead of using the stand. Either ropes or chains  may be used to hang the swing and should be of such length that the seat  will be about 20 in. from the ground or floor.    The drawing giving the dimensions for constructing the seat shows how  the parts are put together. The front and back apron pieces are mortised  to receive a 1-in. square tenon cut on the crosspieces that support the  slats. Each end of the apron pieces extends 4 in., and a hole is bored  at A into which the hanging ropes or chains are fastened. If ropes are  used, bore the holes to fit the rope and when the end of each rope is  put through a hole it is tied in a knot to keep from slipping out.  Chains can be fastened with eye bolts. Small carriage or stove bolts are  used to hold the slats on the framework and cross pieces. The arm rests  are fastened with wood screws.    [Illustration: Details of Seat]    The drawing for the stand gives all the dimensions for its construction.  Split the upright pieces or legs with a saw cut to the length as shown.  A bolt should be put through each piece edgewise at the end of the saw  cut, to keep the wood from splitting any farther when the ends are  spread to receive the bolts through the cross pieces at the top. The  upper ends of the ropes or chains are fastened close to and under the  bolt holding the inside forks of the uprights. This bolt can be long  enough to fasten a clevis that will hang underneath for this purpose.  The whole swing can be painted with a forest green color which is very  suitable for summer outdoor furniture.    [Illustration: Showing Construction of Stand]          HOW TO MAKE A PORTABLE TABLE      [Illustration: Table for Outdoor Use]    A table for outdoor use that can be taken apart, stored or changed from  place to place may be made at small expense. Fasten cleats with screws,  as shown in Fig. 1, to the bottom of a board of suitable size. The legs  are built with a cross piece, A, Fig. 4, at the top which fits into slot  formed by the cleats, CC, and a crosspiece, B, that has two cleats, D,  making a place to receive the bottom end of the brace, E, Fig. 2. The  upper ends of the braces, EE, fit in between two pieces, F, fastened in  the middle of the board. The three pins fitting loosely in DD and F,  Fig. 2, are all that holds table together. The end view is shown in Fig.  3.          HOW TO MAKE A COMBINATION BILLIARD TABLE AND DAVENPORT      A small size billiard table which can be converted quickly into a  davenport is made as follows: Secure clear, selected plain sawed white  oak in sizes as indicated by the drawing. Have these planed at the mill  to the widths and thicknesses specified.    The lower part should be made first. Cut the four posts to length,  chamfering the ends somewhat so that they will not splinter when in use.  Lay out and cut the mortises which are to receive the rails. The lower  rails are to be 1-1/8 in. thick and the mortises are to be laid out in  the legs so as to bring their outer surfaces almost flush with those of  the posts. The upper rails are 2-1/4 in. wide. The slats are 3/4 in.  thick. Tenons should be thoroughly pinned to the sides of the mortises  as shown in the illustration. The braces are 1-3/4 in. thick and are  fastened to place with roundhead screws and glue.    The seat may be made by putting in a solid bottom that shall rest upon  cleats fastened to the inner surfaces of the rails. The top of this  bottom should rest about 3/4 in. below the top edge of the rails. A well  filled leather cushion completes this part.    A more satisfactory result is obtained by putting in springs and  upholstering the seat. Upon this the leather cushion can be placed.    [Illustration: By Swinging the Top Back the Table is Transformed into  the Elegant Davenport Seen on the Opposite Page]    [Illustration: The Billiard Table as Converted into a Luxurious  Davenport--A Child Can Make the Change in a Moment]    The top or table is built upon and about a heavy frame of well seasoned  1-3/4-in. by 5-3/4-in. white pine. The parts to this frame are  thoroughly mortised and tenoned together. Middle stretchers, lengthwise  and crosswise, give added strength and rigidity. Upon this frame the  slate bed is leveled by planing the frame wherever necessary. Slats are  fastened to the bed by screws, the heads of which are countersunk so  that they may be covered over even with plaster of paris.    [Illustration: Details Showing Dimensions of Parts]    The top and side facings are built together, the angle being reinforced  with block and glue, as shown in detail. These facings, to which the  cushions are attached, are afterward made fast to the frame by  ornamental headed screws. The detail and photograph show the manner of  applying the under facing.    Before attaching the top and side facings, the bed cloth should be  placed over the slate and fastened. The nap of the cloth should run from  the head toward the opposite end of the table. Draw the cloth as tight  as possible, taking care that there shall be no wrinkles.    The billiard cushions can be bought ready to cover. The bumpers which  keep the top from striking the front posts can be obtained by making  proper selection from oak door bumpers carried in stock by hardware  dealers. The brass swing bars, most likely, can be obtained at the same  place.    The upholstering on the under side of the top--the back of the  davenport--is to be built upon a stout frame made of some suitable  common wood, and the whole set in the recess formed as shown in the  detail drawing--the whole being fastened from the back before the slate  bed is put in position.    Effort should be made to select leather of a color that will harmonize  with the wood finish which is to be applied.          EASILY MADE BOOK SHELVES      Very cheap but useful and attractive book shelves are shown in the  accompanying drawing. The vertical strips, A, may be 3/4 in. by 2 in.  and are screwed to four shelves, B, each cut to the shape of a quarter  circle. The screws are all countersunk and as the heads all come on the  side next to the wall, they do not show. The design might be varied  somewhat to suit the fancy of the builder, although the appearance of  the shelves constructed as shown is very pleasing, especially so if the  workmanship is good and the wood carefully stained and varnished. The  total cost of construction was less than 75 cents.
