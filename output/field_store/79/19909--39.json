That was a very pleasant  life--full of mice!\"    \"Who was full of mice?\" asked the white kitten, waking up for a moment.    \"I was,\" said the mother sharply; \"and I should have stayed in the mill  for ever, but the miller had another cat sent him by his sister.    \"However, he gave me away to a man who worked a barge up and down the  river. I suppose he thought he should like to see me again sometimes as  the barge passed by.    \"Life in a barge is very exciting. There are such lots of rats, some of  them as big as you kittens. I got quite clever at catching them, though  sometimes they made a very good fight for it. I used to have plenty of  milk, and I slept with the bargee in his warm little bunk, and of nights  I sat and toasted myself in front of his fire in the small, cosy cabin.  He was very fond of me, and used to talk to me a great deal. It is so  lonely on a barge that you are glad of a little conversation. He was  very kind to me, and I was very grieved when he married a lady who  didn't like cats, and who chased me out of the barge with a barge-pole.\"    \"What is a barge-pole?\" the yellow kitten asked lazily.    \"The only leg a barge has. I ran away into the woods, and there I lived  on birds and rabbits.\"    \"What are rabbits?\"    \"Something like cats with long ears; very wholesome and nutritious. And  I should have liked my sixth life very much, but for the keeper. No,  don't interrupt to ask what a keeper is. He is a man who, when he meets  a cat or a rabbit, points a gun at it, and says 'Bang!' so loud that you  die of fright.\"    \"How horrible!\" said all the kittens.    \"I was looking out for my seventh life, and also for the gamekeeper, and  was sitting by the river with both eyes and both ears open, when a  little girl came by--a nice little girl in a checked pinafore.    \"She stopped when she saw me, and called--'Pussy! pussy!' So I went very  slowly to her, and rubbed myself against her legs. Then she picked me up  and carried me home in the checked pinafore. My seventh life was spent  in a clean little cottage with this little girl and her mother. She was  very fond of me, and I was as fond of her as a cat can be of a human  being. Of course, we are never so _unreasonably_ fond of them as they  are of us.\"    \"Why not?\" asked the yellow kitten, who was young and affectionate.    \"Because they're only human beings, and we are Cats,\" returned the  mother, turning her large, calm green eyes on Goldie, who said, \"Oh!\"  and no more.    \"Well, what happened then?\" asked the black kitten, catching its  mother's eye.    \"Well, one day the little girl put me into a basket, and carried me out.  I was always a fine figure of a cat, and I must have been a good weight  to carry. Several times she opened the basket to kiss and stroke me. The  last time she did it we were in a room where a sick girl lay on a bed.    \"'I did not know what to bring you for your birthday,' said my little  girl, 'so I've brought you my dear pussy.'    \"The sick girl's eyes sparkled with delight. She took me in her arms and  stroked me. And though I do not like sick people, I felt flattered and  pleased. But I only stayed a very little time with her.\"    \"Why?\" asked all the kittens at once.    \"Because----but no; that story's too sad for you children; I will tell  it you when you're older.\"    \"But that only makes eight lives,\" said Sweep, who had been counting on  his claws, \"and you said you had nine. Which was the ninth?\"    \"Why, _this_, you silly child,\" said the brindled pussy, sitting up, and  beginning to wash the kitten's face very hard indeed. \"And as it's my  last life, I must be very careful of it. That's why I'm so particular  about what I eat and drink, and why I make a point of sleeping so many  hours a-day. But it's your _first_ life, Snowball, and I can't have you  wasting it all in sleep. Go and catch a mouse at once.\"    \"Yes, mamma,\" said Snowball, and went to sleep again immediately.    \"Ah!\" said Mrs. Brindle, \"I'll wash you next. That'll make you wake up,  my dear.\"    \"Snowball's always sleepy,\" said the yellow kitten, stretching itself.  \"But, mamma dear, she doesn't care for history, and yours was a very  long tale.\"    \"You can't have too much of a good thing,\" said the mother, looking down  at her long brindled tail. \"If it's a good tail, the longer it is the  better.\"          Doggy Tales          Tinker      MY name is Stumps, and my mistress is rather a nice little girl; but she  has her faults, like most people. I myself, as it happens, am  wonderfully free from faults. Among my mistress's faults is what I may  call a lack of dignity, joined to a desire to make other people  undignified too.    You will hardly believe that, before I had belonged to her a month, she  had made me learn to dance and to jump. I am a very respectable  dachshund, of cobby build, and jumping is the very last exercise I  should have taken to of my own accord. But when Miss Daisy said, \"Now  jump, Stumps; there's a darling!\" and held out her little arms, I could  not well refuse. For, after all, the child is my mistress.    I never could understand why the cat was not taught to dance. It seemed  to me very hard that, when I was having those long, miserable lessons,  the cat should be allowed to sit down doing nothing but smile at my  misfortunes. Trap always said we ought to feel honoured by being taught,  and the reason why Pussy wasn't asked to learn was because she was so  dreadfully stupid, and had no brains for anything but the pleasures of  the chase and the cares of a family; but I didn't think that could be  the reason, because the doll was _taught_ to dance, though she never  _learned_, and I am sure _she_ was stupid enough.    Another thing which Miss Daisy taught me to do was to beg; and the  action fills me with shame and pain every time I perform it, and as the  years go on I hate it more and more.    For a stout, middle-aged dog, the action is absurd and degrading. Yet,  such is the force of habit, that I go through the performance now quite  naturally whenever I want anything. Trap does it too, and says what does  it matter? but then he has no judgment, and, besides, he's thin.    But one of the most thoughtless things my little mistress ever did was  one day last summer when she was out without me. I chose to stay at home  because it was very hot, and I knew that the roads would be dusty; and  she was only going down to the village shop, where no one ever thinks  of offering a dog anything to drink. If she had been going to the farm,  I should have gone with her, because the lady there shows proper  attention to visitors, and always sets down a nice dish of milk for us  dogs. Besides, I was a little unwell just then; the family had had duck  for dinner, and I always feel a little faint after duck. All our family  do. So I stayed at home. Well, Miss Daisy had gone out with only Trap  and her hoop. I wish I had been there, for Trap is far too easy-going,  and a hoop never gives any advice worth listening to. Trap told me all  about it as well as he could. Trap can't tell a story very well, poor  fellow!    It seems that, as Miss Daisy went across the village green, she saw a  crowd of children running after a dog with--I hardly like to mention  such a thing--a tin saucepan tied to his tail! The dog bolted into the  empty dog-kennel by the blacksmith's shop, and stayed there, growling.    \"Go away, bad children,\" said Miss Daisy; \"how dare you treat a poor  dear doggie so?\"    The children wouldn't go away at first. \"Very well,\" said Miss Daisy; \"I  shall tell Trap what I think of you all.\"    Then she whispered to Trap, and he began to growl so fiercely that the  children dared not come nearer. Any one can growl. Presently the  children got tired of listening to him, and went away. Then Miss Daisy  coaxed the unpleasant, tin-tailed creature out of the kennel, and untied  the string, and took off the pan. Then, if you'll believe a dog of my  character (and of course you must), she carried that low dog home in her  arms, and washed him, and set him down to eat out of the same plate as  Trap and myself! Trap was friends with him directly--some people have  no spirit--but I hope I know my duty to myself too well for that. I  snarled at the base intruder till he was quite ashamed of himself. I  knew from the first that he'd be taught jumping and begging, and things  like that. I hate those things myself, but that's no reason why every  low dog should be taught them. Miss Daisy called him Tinker, because he  once carried a tin pan about with him, and she tried very hard to make  me friendly to him; but I can choose my own friends, I hope.    Every one made a great fuss about one thing he did, but actually it was  nothing but biting; and if biting isn't natural to a dog, I should like  to know what is; and why people should be praised and petted, and have  new collars, and everybody else's share of the bones, only for doing  what is quite natural to them, I have never been able to comprehend.  Besides, barking is as good as biting, any day, and I'm sure I barked  enough, though it wasn't my business.    Miss Daisy had gone away to stay with her cousins in London, and she had  taken Trap with her. Why she should have taken him instead of me is a  matter on which I can offer no opinion. If my opinion had been asked, I  should have said that I thought it more suitable for her to have a heavy  middle-aged dog of good manners than a harum-scarum young stripling like  Trap. Trap told me afterwards that he thought the reason he was taken  was because Miss Daisy would have had more to pay for the dog-ticket of  such a heavy dog as I am; but I can't believe that dogs are charged for  by the weight, like butter. As I was saying, Miss Daisy took Trap with  her, and also her father and mother; and Tinker and I were left to take  care of the servants. We had a very agreeable time, though I confess  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27238"],[0,"Woodworking Tools 1600-1900 (#5)"],[1,"_Mechanick Exercises_ (3rd ed., 1703) and to the splendid  drawing of the bench plane from Andre-Jacob Roubo's _L'Art du  menuisier_, published in 1769 (fig. 32). In all of them, the rounded  handle, or tote, and the fore-horn appear, characteristics of both  European and English planes of the period before 1750. The similarity  ends with the mass production of hand tools from the shops of the  English toolmaking centers, principally Sheffield. An illustration from  a pattern and design book of the Castle Hill Works, Sheffield, dating  from the last quarter of the 18th century (fig. 33), shows the achieved,  familiar form of the bench planes, as well as other tools. The use of  this form in America is readily documented in Lewis Miller's  self-portrait while working at his trade in York, Pennsylvania, in 1810  (fig. 34) and by the shop sign carved by Isaac Fowle in 1820 for John  Bradford (fig. 35). In each example, the bench plane clearly follows the  English prototype.

Barber's ratchet brace shown in figure 66 completes the metamorphosis of  this tool form in the United States. (Original patent drawing 51,660,  U.S. Patent Office, Record Group 241, the National Archives.)]    The carpenter's brace is another instance of divergent design after a  common origin. Refer again to Van Vliet's etching of the woodworker's  shop (fig. 28), to the detail from Moxon (fig. 36), and from Roubo (fig.  37). All show the brace in a form familiar since the Middle Ages, a  shape common to both delineators and craftsmen of the Continent and the  British Isles. But, as the plane changed, so changed the brace. The  standard form of this tool as it was used and produced in the United  States in the 19th century can be seen in another plate from the  catalogue of the Castle Hill Works at Sheffield (fig. 38). This English  influence on American tool design is no surprise, since as early as 1634  William Wood in _New England's Prospect_ suggested that colonists take  to the New World \"All manner of Ironwares, as all manner of nailes for  houses ... with Axes both broad and pitching ... All manners of Augers,  piercing bits, Whip-saws, Two handed saws, Froes ..., rings for Bettle  heads, and Iron-wedges.\"    [Illustration: Figure 45.--19TH CENTURY: THE UPHOLSTERER'S HAMMER is an  unknown; it is not dated, its maker is anonymous, as is its user. It is  of American origin, yet of a style that might have been used in England  or on the Continent. This lack of provenance need not detract from its  significance as a material survival. This hammer, the brace (fig. 46),  the bevel (fig. 47), and the compass saw (fig. 48) are sufficiently  provocative in their design to conjure some image of a technology  dependent upon the skilled hand of craftsmen working in wood and of the  relationship between the hand, the tool, and the finished product.  (Smithsonian photo 49793-A.)]    [Illustration: Figure 46.--18TH CENTURY: THE BRACE AND BIT in its  nonfactory form conforms to a general design pattern in which none of  the components are ever precisely alike. This aspect of variety of  detail--sophistication, crudeness, decorative qualities or the  like--reflects something of the individuality of the toolmaker, a  quality completely lost in the standardization of the carpenter's brace.  (Smithsonian photo 49794-A.)]    English tool design in the 18th century also influenced the continental  toolmakers. This can be seen in figure 39 in a transitional-type  bitstock (accession 319556) from the Low Countries. Adopting an English  shape, but still preserving the ancient lever device for holding the bit  in place, the piece with its grapevine embellishment is a marked  contrast to the severely functional brass chucks on braces of English  manufacture. No less a contrast are metallic versions of the brace.  These begin to appear with some regularity in the U.S. patent  specifications of the 1840's; their design is apparently derived from  18th-century precedents. Roubo (fig. 40) illustrated a metal bitstock in  1769, as did Ford, Whitmore & Brunton, makers of jewelers' and  watchmakers' tools, of Birmingham, England, in their trade catalogue of  1775 (fig. 41). Each suggests a prototype of the patented forms of the  1840's. For example, in 1852, Jacob Switzer of Basil, Ohio, suggested,  as had Roubo a hundred years earlier, that the bitstock be used as a  screwdriver (fig. 42); but far more interesting than Switzer's idea was  his delineation of the brace itself, which he described as \"an ordinary  brace and bit stock\" (U.S. pat. 9,457). The inference is that such a  tool form was already a familiar one among the woodworking trades in the  United States. Disregarding the screwdriver attachment, which is not  without merit, Switzer's stock represents an accurate rendering of what  was then a well-known form if not as yet a rival of the older wooden  brace. Likewise, J. Parker Gordon's patent 52,042 of 1866 exemplifies  the strengthening of a basic tool by the use of iron (fig. 43) and, as a  result, the achievement of an even greater functionalism in design. The  complete break with the medieval, however, is seen in a drawing  submitted to the Commissioner of Patents in 1865 (pat. 51,660) by Milton  V. Nobles of Rochester, New York.[9] Nobles' creation was of thoroughly  modern design and appearance in which, unlike earlier types, the bit was  held in place by a solid socket, split sleeve, and a tightening ring  (fig. 44). In three centuries, three distinct design changes occurred in  the carpenter's brace. First, about 1750, the so-called English or  Sheffield bitstock appeared. This was followed in the very early 19th  century by the reinforced English type whose sides were splinted by  brass strips. Not only had the medieval form largely disappeared by the  end of the 18th century, but so had the ancient lever-wedge method of  fastening the bit in the stock, a device replaced by the pressure-spring  button on the side of the chuck. Finally, in this evolution, came the  metallic stock, not widely used in"]]]
