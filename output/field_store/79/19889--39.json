Cast in the lap of naked nature, and exposed to every hardship, the  forms of women, in savage life, are but little engaging. With nothing  that deserves the name of culture, their latent qualities, if they have  any, are like the diamond, while enclosed in the rough flint, incapable  of shewing any lustre. Thus destitute of every thing by which they can  excite love, or acquire esteem; destitute of beauty to charm, or art to  soothe, the tyrant man; they are by him destined to perform every mean  and servile office. In this the American and other savage women differ  widely from those of Asia, who, if they are destitute of the  qualifications necessary for gaining esteem, have beauty, ornaments, and  the art of exciting love.    In civilized countries a woman acquires some power by being the mother  of a numerous family, who obey her maternal authority, and defends her  honor and her life. But, even as a mother, a female savage has not much  advantage. Her children, daily accustomed to see their father treat her  nearly as a slave, soon begin to imitate his example, and either pay  little regard to her authority or shake it off altogether.    Of this the Hottentot boys afford a remarkable proof. They are brought  up by the women, till they are about fourteen years of age. Then, with  several ceremonies they are initiated into the society of men. After  this initiation is over it is reckoned manly for a boy to take the  earliest opportunity of returning to the hut of his mother, and beating  her in the most barbarous manner, to show that he is now out of her  jurisdiction. Should the mother complain to the men, they would only  applaud the boy for showing so laudable a contempt for the society and  authority of women.    In the Brazils, the females are obliged to follow their husbands to war,  to supply the place of beasts of burden, and to carry on their backs  their children, provisions, hammocks, and every thing wanted in the  field.    In the Isthmus of Darien, they are sent along with warriors and  travellers, as we do baggage horses. Even their Queen appeared before  some English gentlemen, carrying her sucking child, wrapt in a red  blanket.    The women among the Indians of America are what the Helots were among  the Spartans, a vanquished people obliged to toil for their conquerors.  Hence on the banks of the Oroonoko we have heard of mothers slaying  their daughters out of compassion, and smothering them in the hour of  their birth. They consider this barbarous pity as a virtue.    Father Joseph Gumilla, reproving one of them for this inhuman crime,  received the following answer:--\"I wish to God, Father, I wish to God,  that my mother had, by my death, prevented the manifold distresses I  have endured, and have yet to endure as long as I live. Had she kindly  stilled me in my birth, I should not have felt the pain of death, nor  the numberless other pains to which life has subjected me. Consider,  Father, our deplorable condition. Our husbands go to hunt with their  bows and arrows, and trouble themselves no farther: we are dragged along  with one infant at our breast, and another in a basket. They return in  the evening without any burden; we return with the burden of our  children. Though tired with long walking, we are not allowed to sleep,  but must labor the whole night, in grinding maize to make _chica_ for  them. They get drunk, and in their drunkenness beat us, draw us by the  hair of the head, and tread us under foot. A young wife is brought upon  us and permitted to abuse us and our children. What kindness can we show  to our female children, equal to that of relieving them from such  servitude, more bitter a thousand times than death? I repeat again,  would to God my mother had put me under ground, the moment I was born.\"    \"The men,\" says Commodore Byron, in his account of the inhabitants of  South America, \"exercise a most despotic authority over their wives whom  they consider in the same view they do any other part of their property,  and dispose of them accordingly. Even their common treatment of them is  cruel. For, though the toil and hazard of procuring food lies entirely  on the women, yet they are not suffered to touch any part of it, until  the husband is satisfied; and then he assign them their portion, which  is generally very scanty, and such as he has not a stomach for himself.\"    The Greenlanders, who live mostly upon seals, think it sufficient to  catch and bring them on shore; and would rather submit to starve than  assist their women in skinning, dressing, or dragging home the cumbrous  animals to their huts.    In some parts of America, when the men kill any game in the woods, they  lay it at the root of a tree, fix a mark there, and travelling until  they arrive at their habitation, send their women to fetch it, a task  which their own laziness and pride equally forbid.    Among many of the tribes of wandering Arabs, the women are not only  obliged to do every domestic and every rural work, but also to feed, to  dress, and saddle the horses, for the use of their husbands.    The Moorish women, besides doing all the same kinds of drudgery, are  also obliged to cultivate the fields, while their husbands stand idle  spectators of the toil, or sleep inglorious beneath a neighboring shade.    In Madura the husband generally speaks to his wife in the most imperious  tone; while she with fear and trembling approaches him, waits upon him  while at meals, and pronounces not his name, but with the addition of  every dignifying title she can devise. In return for all this submission  he frequently beats and abuses her in the most barbarous manner. Being  asked the reason of such a behavior, one of them answered, \"As our wives  are so much our inferiors why should we allow them to eat and drink with  us? Why should they not serve us with whatever we call for, and  afterwards sit down and eat up what we leave? If they commit faults, why  should they not suffer correction? It is their business only to bring up  our children, pound our rice, make our oil, and do every other kind of  drudgery, purposes to which only their low and inferior natures are  adapted.\"    The Circassian custom of breeding young girls, on purpose to be sold in  the public market to the highest bidder, is generally known. Perhaps,  however, upon minute examination, we shall find that women are, in some  degree, bought and sold in every country, whether savage or civilized.      EASTERN WOMEN.    The women of the East, have in general, always exhibited the same  appearance. Their manners, customs, and fashions, unalterable like their  rocks, have stood the test of many revolving ages. Though the kingdoms  of their country have often changed masters, though they have submitted  to the arms of almost every invader, yet the laws by which their sex are  governed and enslaved, have never been revised nor amended.    Had the manners and customs of the Asiatic women been subject to the  same changes as they are in Europe, we might have expected the same  changes in the sentiments and writings of their men. But, as this is not  the case, we have reason to presume that the sentiments entertained by  Solomon, by the apocryphal writers, and by the ancient Bramins, are the  sentiments of this day.    Though the confinement of women be an unlawful exertion of superior  power, yet it affords a proof that the inhabitants of the East are  advanced some degrees farther in civilization than mere savages, who  have hardly any love and consequently as little jealousy.    This confinement is not very rigid in the empire of the Mogul. It is,  perhaps, less so in China, and in Japan hardly exists.    Though women are confined in the Turkish empire, they experience every  other indulgence. They are allowed, at stated times, to go to the public  baths; their apartments are richly, if not elegantly furnished; they  have a train of female slaves to serve and amuse them; and their persons  are adorned with every costly ornament which their fathers or husbands  can afford.    Notwithstanding the strictness of confinement in Persia, their women are  treated with several indulgences. They are allowed a variety of precious  liquors, costly perfumes, and beautiful slaves: their apartments are  furnished with the most elegant hangings and carpets; their persons  ornamented with the finest silks, and even loaded with the sparkling  jewels of the East. But all these trappings, however elegant, or however  gilded, are only like the golden chains sometimes made use of to bind a  royal prisoner.    Solomon had a great number of queens and concubines; but a petty Hindoo  chief has been known to have two thousand women confined within the  walls of his harem, and appropriated entirely to his pleasure. Nothing  less than unlimited power in the husband is able to restrain women so  confined, from the utmost disorder and confusion. They may repine in  secret, but they must clothe their features with cheerfulness when their  lord appears. Contumacy draws down on them immediate punishment: they  are degraded, chastised, divorced, shut up in dark dungeons, and  sometimes put to death.    Their persons, however, are so sacred, that they must not in the least  be violated, nor even be looked at, by any one but their husbands. This  female privilege has given an opportunity of executing many  conspiracies. Warriors, in such vehicles as are usually employed to  carry women, have been often conveyed, without examination, into the  apartments of the great; from whence, instead of issuing forth in the  smiles of beauty, they have rushed out in the terror of arms, and laid  the tyrants at their feet.    No stranger is ever allowed to see the women of Hindostan, nor can even  brothers visit their sisters in private. To be conscious of the  existence of a man's wives seems a crime; and he looks surly and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2612"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 3 (#5)"],[1,"were deficient. He had long been  preeminently distinguished as a negotiator. He was the author and the  soul of the European coalition against the French ascendency. The clue,  without which it was perilous to enter the vast and intricate maze  of Continental politics, was in his hands. His English counsellors,  therefore, however able and active, seldom, during his reign, ventured  to meddle with that part of the public business which he had taken as  his peculiar province. [11]    The internal government of England could be carried on only by the  advice and agency of English ministers. Those ministers William selected  in such a manner as showed that he was determined not to proscribe any  set of men who were willing to support his throne. On the day after  the crown had been presented to him in the Banqueting House, the Privy  Council was sworn in. Most of the Councillors were Whigs; but the names  of several eminent Tories appeared in the list. [12] The four highest  offices in the state were assigned to four noblemen, the representatives  of four classes of politicians.    In practical ability and official experience Danby had no superior among  his contemporaries. To the gratitude of the new Sovereigns he had a  strong claim; for it was by his dexterity that their marriage had been  brought about in spite of difficulties which had seemed insuperable. The  enmity which he had always borne to France was a scarcely less powerful  recommendation. He had signed the invitation of the thirtieth of June,  had excited and directed the northern insurrection, and had, in the  Convention, exerted all his influence and eloquence in opposition to  the scheme of Regency. Yet the Whigs regarded him with unconquerable  distrust and aversion. They could not forget that he had, in evil days,  been the first minister of the state, the head of the Cavaliers, the  champion of prerogative, the persecutor of dissenters. Even in becoming  a rebel, he had not ceased to be a Tory. If he had drawn the sword  against the Crown, he had drawn it only in defence of the Church. If he  had, in the Convention, done good by opposing the scheme of Regency, he  had done harm by obstinately maintaining that the throne was not vacant,  and that the Estates had no right to determine who should fill it. The  Whigs were therefore of opinion that he ought to think himself  amply rewarded for his recent merits by being suffered to escape the  punishment of those offences for which he had been impeached ten years  before. He, on the other hand, estimated his own abilities and services,  which were doubtless considerable, at their full value, and thought  himself entitled to the great place of Lord High Treasurer, which he had  formerly held. But he was disappointed. William, on principle, thought  it desirable to divide the power and patronage of the Treasury among  several Commissioners. He was the first English King who never, from the  beginning to the end of his reign, trusted the white staff in the hands  of a single subject. Danby was offered his choice between the Presidency  of the Council and a Secretaryship of State. He sullenly accepted the  Presidency, and, while the Whigs murmured at seeing him placed so high,  hardly attempted to conceal his anger at not having been placed higher.  [13]    Halifax, the most illustrious man of that small party which boasted that  it kept the balance even between Whigs and Tories, took charge of the  Privy Seal, and continued to be Speaker of the House of Lords. [14] He  had been foremost in strictly legal opposition to the late Government,  and had spoken and written with great ability against the dispensing  power: but he had refused to know any thing about the design of  invasion: he had laboured, even when the Dutch were in full march  towards London, to effect a reconciliation; and he had never deserted  James till James had deserted the throne. But, from the moment of that  shameful flight, the sagacious Trimmer, convinced that compromise was  thenceforth impossible, had taken a decided part. He had distinguished  himself preeminently in the Convention: nor was it without a peculiar  propriety that he had been appointed to the honourable office of  tendering the crown, in the name of all the Estates of England, to the  Prince and Princess of Orange; for our Revolution, as far as it can  be said to bear the character of any single mind, assuredly bears the  character of the large yet cautious mind of Halifax. The Whigs, however,  were not in a temper to accept a recent service as an atonement for an  old offence; and the offence of Halifax had been grave indeed. He had  long before been conspicuous in their front rank during a hard fight  for liberty. When they were at length victorious, when it seemed that  Whitehall was at their mercy, when they had a near prospect of dominion  and revenge, he had changed sides; and fortune had changed sides with  him. In the great debate on the Exclusion Bill, his eloquence had struck  them dumb, and had put new life into the inert and desponding party of  the Court. It was true that, though he had left them in the day of  their insolent prosperity, he had returned to them in the day of their  distress. But, now that their distress was over, they forgot that he had  returned to them, and remembered only that he had left them. [15]    The vexation with which they saw Danby presiding in the Council, and  Halifax bearing the Privy Seal, was not diminished by the news that  Nottingham was appointed Secretary of State. Some of those zealous  churchmen who had never ceased to profess the doctrine of nonresistance,  who thought the Revolution unjustifiable, who had voted for a Regency,  and who had to the last maintained that the English throne could never  be one moment vacant, yet conceived it to be their duty to submit to the  decision of the Convention. They had not, they said, rebelled against  James. They had not selected William. But, now that they saw on the  throne a Sovereign whom they never would have placed there, they were  of opinion that no law, divine or human, bound them to carry the contest  further. They thought that they found, both in the Bible and in the  Statute Book, directions which could not be misunderstood. The Bible  enjoins obedience to the powers that be. The Statute Book contains an  act providing that no subject shall be deemed a wrongdoer for adhering  to the King in possession. On these grounds many, who had not concurred  in setting up the new government, believed that they might give it  their support without offence to God or man. One of the most eminent  politicians of this school was Nottingham. At his instance the  Convention had, before the throne was filled, made such changes in the  oath of allegiance as enabled him and those who agreed with him to take  that oath without scruple. \"My principles,\" he said, \"do not permit me  to bear any part in making a King. But when a King has been made, my  principles bind me to pay him an obedience more strict than he can  expect from those who have made him.\" He now, to the surprise of some  of those who most esteemed him, consented to sit in the council, and  to accept the seals of Secretary. William doubtless hoped that this  appointment would be considered by the clergy and the Tory country  gentlemen as a sufficient guarantee that no evil was meditated against  the Church. Even Burnet, who at a later period felt a strong antipathy  to Nottingham, owned, in some memoirs written soon after the Revolution,  that the King had judged well, and that the influence of the Tory  Secretary, honestly exerted in support of the new Sovereigns, had saved  England from great calamities. [16]    The other Secretary was Shrewsbury. [17] No man so young had within  living memory occupied so high a post in the government. He had but just  completed his twenty-eighth year. Nobody, however, except the solemn  formalists at the Spanish embassy, thought his youth an objection to his  promotion. [18] He had already secured for himself a place in history  by the conspicuous part which he had taken in the deliverance of his  country. His talents, his accomplishments, his graceful manners, his  bland temper, made him generally popular. By the Whigs especially he  was almost adored. None suspected that, with many great and many amiable  qualities, he had such faults both of head and of heart as would  make the rest of a life which had opened under the fairest auspices  burdensome to himself and almost useless to his country.    The naval administration and the financial administration were confided  to Boards. Herbert was First Commissioner of the Admiralty. He had in  the late reign given up wealth and dignities when he found that he could  not retain them with honour and with a good conscience. He had carried  the memorable invitation to the Hague. He had commanded the Dutch fleet  during the voyage from Helvoetsluys to Torbay. His character for courage  and professional skill stood high. That he had had his follies and vices  was well known. But his recent conduct in the time of severe trial had  atoned for all, and seemed to warrant the hope that his future career  would be glorious. Among the commissioners who sate with him at the  Admiralty were two distinguished members of the House of Commons,  William Sacheverell, a veteran Whig, who had great authority in his  party, and Sir John Lowther, an honest and very moderate Tory, who in  fortune and parliamentary interest was among the first of the English  gentry. [19]    Mordaunt, one of the most vehement of the Whigs, was placed at the head  of the Treasury; why, it is difficult to say. His romantic courage, his  flighty wit, his eccentric invention, his love of desperate risks and  startling effects, were not qualities likely to be of much use to him in  financial calculations and negotiations.
