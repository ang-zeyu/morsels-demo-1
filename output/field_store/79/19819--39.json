But you must think,  whatsoever they have said could be taken where they came but for a  dream.  Now for our travelling from henna into parts abroad, our  Lawgiver thought fit altogether to restrain it.  So is it not in China.  For the Chinese sail where they will or can; which sheweth that their  law of keeping out strangers is a law of pusillanimity and fear.  But  this restraint of ours hath one only exception, which is admirable;  preserving the good which cometh by communicating with strangers, and  avoiding the hurt; and I will now open it to you.  And here I shall  seem a little to digress, but you will by and by find it pertinent.    \"Ye shall understand (my dear friends) that amongst the excellent acts  of that king, one above all hath the pre-eminence.  It was the erection  and institution of an Order or Society, which we call Salomon's House;  the noblest foundation (as we think) that ever was upon the earth; and  the lanthorn of this kingdom.  It is dedicated to the study of the  works and creatures of God.  Some think it beareth the founder's name a  little corrupted, as if it should be Solamona's House.  But the records  write it as it is spoken.  So as I take it to be denominate of the king  of the Hebrews, which is famous with you, and no stranger to us.  For  we have some parts of his works, which with you are lost; namely, that  natural history, which he wrote, of all plants, from the cedar of  Libanus to the moss that groweth out of the wall, and of all things  that have life and motion.  This maketh me think that our king, finding  himself to symbolize in many things with that king of the Hebrews  (which lived many years before him), honored him with the title of this  foundation.  And I am rather induced to be of this opinion, for that I  find in ancient records this Order or Society is sometimes called  Salomon's House, and sometimes the College of the Six Days Works;  whereby I am satisfied that our excellent king had learned from the  Hebrews that God had created the world and all that therein is within  six days: and therefore he instituting that House for the finding out  of the true nature of all things, (whereby God might have the more  glory in the workmanship of them, and insert the more fruit in the use  of them), did give it also that second name.    \"But now to come to our present purpose.  When the king had forbidden  to all his people navigation into any part that was not under his  crown, he made nevertheless this ordinance; that every twelve years  there should be set forth, out of this kingdom two ships, appointed to  several voyages; That in either of these ships there should be a  mission of three of the Fellows or Brethren of Salomon's House; whose  errand was only to give us knowledge of the affairs and state of those  countries to which they were designed, and especially of the sciences,  arts, manufactures, and inventions of all the world; and withal to  bring unto us books, instruments, and patterns in every kind: That the  ships, after they had landed the brethren, should return; and that the  brethren should stay abroad till the new mission.  These ships are not  otherwise fraught, than with store of victuals, and good quantity of  treasure to remain with the brethren, for the buying of such things and  rewarding of such persons as they should think fit.  Now for me to tell  you how the vulgar sort of mariners are contained from being discovered  at land; and how they that must be put on shore for any time, color  themselves under the names of other nations; and to what places these  voyages have been designed; and what places of rendezvous are appointed  for the new missions; and the like circumstances of the practique; I  may not do it: neither is it much to your desire.  But thus you see we  maintain a trade not for gold, silver, or jewels; nor for silks; nor  for spices; nor any other commodity of matter; but only for God's first  creature, which was Light: to have light (I say) of the growth of all  parts of the world.\"    And when he had said this, he was silent; and so were we all.  For  indeed we were all astonished to hear so strange things so probably  told.  And he, perceiving that we were willing to say somewhat but had  it not ready in great courtesy took us off, and descended to ask us  questions of our voyage and fortunes and in the end concluded, that we  might do well to think with ourselves what time of stay we would demand  of the state; and bade us not to scant ourselves; for he would procure  such time as we desired: Whereupon we all rose up, and presented  ourselves to kiss the skirt of his tippet; but he would not suffer us;  and so took his leave.  But when it came once amongst our people that  the state used to offer conditions to strangers that would stay, we had  work enough to get any of our men to look to our ship; and to keep them  from going presently to the governor to crave conditions.  But with  much ado we refrained them, till we might agree what course to take.    We took ourselves now for free men, seeing there was no danger of our  utter perdition; and lived most joyfully, going abroad and seeing what  was to be seen in the city and places adjacent within our tedder; and  obtaining acquaintance with many of the city, not of the meanest  quality; at whose hands we found such humanity, and such a freedom and  desire to take strangers as it were into their bosom, as was enough to  make us forget all that was dear to us in our own countries: and  continually we met with many things right worthy of observation and  relation: as indeed, if there be a mirror in the world worthy to hold  men's eyes, it is that country.    One day there were two of our company bidden to a Feast of the Family,  as they call it.  A most natural, pious, and reverend custom it is,  shewing that nation to be compounded of all goodness.  This is the  manner of it.  It is granted to any man that shall live to see thirty  persons descended of his body alive together, and all above three years  old, to make this feast which is done at the cost of the state. The  Father of the Family, whom they call the Tirsan, two days before the  feast, taketh to him three of such friends as he liketh to choose; and  is assisted also by the governor of the city or place where the feast  is celebrated; and all the persons of the family, of both sexes, are  summoned to attend him.  These two days the Tirsan sitteth in  consultation concerning the good estate of the family.  There, if there  be any discord or suits between any of the family, they are compounded  and appeased.  There, if any of the family be distressed or decayed,  order is taken for their relief and competent means to live. There, if  any be subject to vice, or take ill courses, they are reproved and  censured.  So likewise direction is given touching marriages, and the  courses of life, which any of them should take, with divers other the  like orders and advices.  The governor assisteth, to the end to put in  execution by his public authority the decrees and orders of the Tirsan,  if they should be disobeyed; though that seldom needeth; such reverence  and obedience they give to the order of nature.  The Tirsan doth also  then ever choose one man from among his sons, to live in house with  him; who is called ever after the Son of the Vine.  The reason will  hereafter appear.    On the feast day, the father or Tirsan cometh forth after divine  service into a large room where the feast is celebrated; which room  hath an half-pace at the upper end.  Against the wall, in the middle of  the half-pace, is a chair placed for him, with a table and carpet  before it.  Over the chair is a state, made round or oval, and it is of  ivy; an ivy somewhat whiter than ours, like the leaf of a silver asp;  but more shining; for it is green all winter.  And the state is  curiously wrought with silver and silk of divers colors, broiding or  binding in the ivy; and is ever of the work of some of the daughters of  the family; and veiled over at the top with a fine net of silk and  silver.  But the substance of it is true ivy; whereof, after it is  taken down, the friends of the family are desirous to have some leaf or  sprig to keep.    The Tirsan cometh forth with all his generation or linage, the males  before him, and the females following him; and if there be a mother  from whose body the whole linage is descended, there is a traverse  placed in a loft above on the right hand of the chair, with a privy  door, and a carved window of glass, leaded with gold and blue; where  she sitteth, but is not seen.  When the Tirsan is come forth, he  sitteth down in the chair; and all the linage place themselves against  the wall, both at his back and upon the return of the half-pace, in  order of their years without difference of sex; and stand upon their  feet.  When he is set; the room being always full of company, but well  kept and without disorder; after some pause, there cometh in from the  lower end of the room, a taratan (which is as much as an herald) and on  either side of him two young lads; whereof one carrieth a scroll of  their shining yellow parchment; and the other a cluster of grapes of  gold, with a long foot or stalk.  The herald and children are clothed  with mantles of sea-water green satin; but the herald's mantle is  streamed with gold, and hath a train.    Then the herald with three curtesies, or rather inclinations, cometh up  as far as the half-pace; and there first taketh into his hand the  scroll.  This scroll is the king's charter, containing gifts of  revenew, and many privileges, exemptions, and points of honour, granted  to the Father of the Family; and is ever styled and directed, To such  do one our well beloved friend and creditor: which is a title proper  only to this case.

That Yves de Cornault disliked dogs, and that his  wife, to gratify her own fancy, persistently ignored this dislike.  As for pleading this trivial disagreement as an excuse for her  relations--whatever their nature--with her supposed accomplice, the  argument was so absurd that her own lawyer manifestly regretted having  let her make use of it, and tried several times to cut short her story.  But she went on to the end, with a kind of hypnotized insistence, as  though the scenes she evoked were so real to her that she had forgotten  where she was and imagined herself to be re-living them.    At length the Judge who had previously shown a certain kindness to her  said (leaning forward a little, one may suppose, from his row of dozing  colleagues): \"Then you would have us believe that you murdered your  husband because he would not let you keep a pet dog?\"    \"I did not murder my husband.\"    \"Who did, then? Herve de Lanrivain?\"    \"No.\"    \"Who then? Can you tell us?\"    \"Yes, I can tell you. The dogs--\" At that point she was carried out of  the court in a swoon.    *****    It was evident that her lawyer tried to get her to abandon this line  of defense. Possibly her explanation, whatever it was, had seemed  convincing when she poured it out to him in the heat of their first  private colloquy; but now that it was exposed to the cold daylight of  judicial scrutiny, and the banter of the town, he was thoroughly ashamed  of it, and would have sacrificed her without a scruple to save his  professional reputation. But the obstinate Judge--who perhaps, after  all, was more inquisitive than kindly--evidently wanted to hear  the story out, and she was ordered, the next day, to continue her  deposition.    She said that after the disappearance of the old watchdog nothing  particular happened for a month or two. Her husband was much as usual:  she did not remember any special incident. But one evening a pedlar  woman came to the castle and was selling trinkets to the maids. She had  no heart for trinkets, but she stood looking on while the women made  their choice. And then, she did not know how, but the pedlar coaxed her  into buying for herself a pear-shaped pomander with a strong scent in  it--she had once seen something of the kind on a gypsy woman. She had  no desire for the pomander, and did not know why she had bought it. The  pedlar said that whoever wore it had the power to read the future;  but she did not really believe that, or care much either. However, she  bought the thing and took it up to her room, where she sat turning it  about in her hand. Then the strange scent attracted her and she began to  wonder what kind of spice was in the box. She opened it and found a grey  bean rolled in a strip of paper; and on the paper she saw a sign she  knew, and a message from Herve de Lanrivain, saying that he was at home  again and would be at the door in the court that night after the moon  had set....    She burned the paper and sat down to think. It was nightfall, and her  husband was at home.... She had no way of warning Lanrivain, and there  was nothing to do but to wait....    At this point I fancy the drowsy court-room beginning to wake up. Even  to the oldest hand on the bench there must have been a certain relish  in picturing the feelings of a woman on receiving such a message at  nightfall from a man living twenty miles away, to whom she had no means  of sending a warning....    She was not a clever woman, I imagine; and as the first result of her  cogitation she appears to have made the mistake of being, that evening,  too kind to her husband. She could not ply him with wine, according to  the traditional expedient, for though he drank heavily at times he had  a strong head; and when he drank beyond its strength it was because  he chose to, and not because a woman coaxed him. Not his wife, at any  rate--she was an old story by now. As I read the case, I fancy there was  no feeling for her left in him but the hatred occasioned by his supposed  dishonour.    At any rate, she tried to call up her old graces; but early in the  evening he complained of pains and fever, and left the hall to go up to  the closet where he sometimes slept. His servant carried him a cup  of hot wine, and brought back word that he was sleeping and not to be  disturbed; and an hour later, when Anne lifted the tapestry and listened  at his door, she heard his loud regular breathing. She thought it might  be a feint, and stayed a long time barefooted in the passage, her ear  to the crack; but the breathing went on too steadily and naturally to  be other than that of a man in a sound sleep. She crept back to her room  reassured, and stood in the window watching the moon set through the  trees of the park. The sky was misty and starless, and after the moon  went down the night was black as pitch. She knew the time had come,  and stole along the passage, past her husband's door--where she stopped  again to listen to his breathing--to the top of the stairs. There she  paused a moment, and assured herself that no one was following her; then  she began to go down the stairs in the darkness. They were so steep and  winding that she had to go very slowly, for fear of stumbling. Her one  thought was to get the door unbolted, tell Lanrivain to make his escape,  and hasten back to her room. She had tried the bolt earlier in the  evening, and managed to put a little grease on it; but nevertheless,  when she drew it, it gave a squeak... not loud, but it made her heart  stop; and the next minute, overhead, she heard a noise....    \"What noise?\" the prosecution interposed.    \"My husband's voice calling out my name and cursing me.\"    \"What did you hear after that?\"    \"A terrible scream and a fall.\"    \"Where was Herve de Lanrivain at this time?\"    \"He was standing outside in the court. I just made him out in the  darkness. I told him for God's sake to go, and then I pushed the door  shut.\"    \"What did you do next?\"    \"I stood at the foot of the stairs and listened.\"    \"What did you hear?\"    \"I heard dogs snarling and panting.\" (Visible discouragement of the  bench, boredom of the public, and exasperation of the lawyer for the  defense. Dogs again--! But the inquisitive Judge insisted.)    \"What dogs?\"    She bent her head and spoke so low that she had to be told to repeat her  answer: \"I don't know.\"    \"How do you mean--you don't know?\"    \"I don't know what dogs....\"    The Judge again intervened: \"Try to tell us exactly what happened. How  long did you remain at the foot of the stairs?\"    \"Only a few minutes.\"    \"And what was going on meanwhile overhead?\"    \"The dogs kept on snarling and panting. Once or twice he cried out. I  think he moaned once. Then he was quiet.\"    \"Then what happened?\"    \"Then I heard a sound like the noise of a pack when the wolf is thrown  to them--gulping and lapping.\"    (There was a groan of disgust and repulsion through the court, and  another attempted intervention by the distracted lawyer. But the  inquisitive Judge was still inquisitive.)    \"And all the while you did not go up?\"    \"Yes--I went up then--to drive them off.\"    \"The dogs?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well--?\"    \"When I got there it was quite dark. I found my husband's flint and  steel and struck a spark. I saw him lying there. He was dead.\"    \"And the dogs?\"    \"The dogs were gone.\"    \"Gone--whereto?\"    \"I don't know. There was no way out--and there were no dogs at Kerfol.\"    She straightened herself to her full height, threw her arms above her  head, and fell down on the stone floor with a long scream. There was a  moment of confusion in the court-room. Some one on the bench was heard  to say: \"This is clearly a case for the ecclesiastical authorities\"--and  the prisoner's lawyer doubtless jumped at the suggestion.    After this, the trial loses itself in a maze of cross-questioning and  squabbling. Every witness who was called corroborated Anne de Cornault's  statement that there were no dogs at Kerfol: had been none for several  months. The master of the house had taken a dislike to dogs, there was  no denying it But, on the other hand, at the inquest, there had been  long and bitter discussions as to the nature of the dead man's wounds.  One of the surgeons called in had spoken of marks that looked like  bites. The suggestion of witchcraft was revived, and the opposing  lawyers hurled tomes of necromancy at each other.    At last Anne de Cornault was brought back into court--at the instance of  the same Judge--and asked if she knew where the dogs she spoke of could  have come from. On the body of her Redeemer she swore that she did not.  Then the Judge put his final question: \"If the dogs you think you heard  had been known to you, do you think you would have recognized them by  their barking?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you recognize them?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What dogs do you take them to have been?\"    \"My dead dogs,\" she said in a whisper.... She was taken out of court,  not to reappear there again. There was some kind of ecclesiastical  investigation, and the end of the business was that the Judges disagreed  with each other, and with the ecclesiastical committee, and that    Anne de Cornault was finally handed over to the keeping of her husband's  family, who shut her up in the keep of Kerfol, where she is said to have  died many years later, a harmless mad-woman.    So ends her story. As for that of Herve de Lanrivain, I had only to  apply to his collateral descendant for its subsequent details. The  evidence against the young man being insufficient, and his family  influence in the duchy considerable, he was set free, and left soon  afterward for Paris. He was probably in no mood for a worldly life, and  he appears to have come almost immediately under the influence of the  famous M. Arnauld d'Andilly and the gentlemen of Port Royal.
