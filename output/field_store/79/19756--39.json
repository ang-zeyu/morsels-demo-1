But his letter marks an epoch  none the less.  At first, as we have seen, the avowed policy of the  Premier, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of the King was the  same.  The difference which now emerges is that M. Venizelos desired to  throw Greece into the War immediately, without conditions and without  any invitation from the Entente, while the King and M. Streit were more  circumspect.  M. Venizelos chose to interpret their circumspection as  prompted by regard for Germany, and did not hesitate to convey this  view to Entente quarters.  It was, perhaps, a plausible insinuation,  since the King had a German wife and M. Streit was of German descent.  But, as a matter of fact, at the moment when it was made, King  Constantine voluntarily presented to the British Admiralty through  Admiral Kerr the plans for the taking of the Dardanelles which his  Staff had {16} elaborated, and for a long time afterwards continued to  supply the British Government, through the same channel, with  information from his secret service.[19]        [1] See Art. 1 of the Military Convention.  As this article originally  stood, the promise of mutual support was expressly limited to the \"case  of war between Greece and Bulgaria or between Servia and Bulgaria.\"  It  was altered at the eleventh hour at Servia's request, and not without  objections on the part of Greek military men, into a \"case of war  between one of the allied States and a third Power breaking out under  the circumstances foreseen by the Graeco-Servian Treaty of Alliance.\"  But the only circumstances foreseen and provided for by that Treaty  relate to war with Bulgaria, and it is a question whether any other  interpretation would stand before a court of International Law, despite  the \"third Power\" phrase in the Military Convention.

As much  acrimonious discussion has arisen over King Constantine's last  dispatch, it is worth while noting the circumstances under which it was  sent.  Vice-Admiral Mark Kerr, Chief of the British Naval Mission in  Greece, relates how the King brought the Kaiser's telegram and read it  to him: \"He was indignant at the interference in his country's affairs.  However, to stop such telegrams coming in daily, he determined to send  on this occasion a sympathetic answer.\"  (See _The Times_, 9 Dec.,  1920.)  The communication, therefore, was no secret from the British  Government.  Nor was it from M. Venizelos; for the King's dispatch is  but a summary of an identical declaration made by M. Venizelos's  Government itself to the German Government: Streit to Greek Legation,  Berlin, 26 July/8 Aug., 1914.

Though the plans in question were  not used, they were among the very few sources of reliable information  with which Sir Ian Hamilton left England to take up the command of the  Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.--_Dardanelles Commission, Final  Report_, par. 17.          {17}    CHAPTER II    Before proceeding any further with the development of the position in  Greece, it will be well to cast a glance on the attitudes maintained by  the other Balkan States and the views entertained towards them by the  Entente Powers.  One must know all the possible combinations on the  Balkan chess-board before one can profitably study or estimate the real  place of the Greek pawn.    Bulgaria proclaimed her firm intention to remain neutral; but, to judge  from the Greek diplomatic representatives' reports, there was every  indication that she only awaited a favourable opportunity, such as some  brilliant military success of the Central Powers, in order to invade  Servia without risk.  Meanwhile, well-armed irregular bands, equipped by  the Bulgarian Government and commanded by Bulgarian officers \"on  furlough,\" made their appearance on the Servian frontier, and the  Bulgarian Press daily grew more hostile in its tone.[1]    Alarmed by these symptoms, the Greek General Staff renewed the efforts  which it had been making since the beginning of 1914, to concert plans  with the Servian military authorities for common action in accordance  with their alliance, and asked the Servian Minister of War if, in case  Bulgaria ordered a general mobilization, Servia would be disposed to  bring part of her forces against her, so as to prevent the concentration  of the Bulgarian army and give the Greek army time to mobilize.  The  reply was that, if Bulgaria did order mobilization, the Serbs were  obliged to turn against her with all their available forces.  Only, as  Austria had just started an offensive, nobody could know how many forces  they would have available--perhaps they could face the situation with the  25,000 or 30,000 men in the new provinces; but, in {18} any case, it did  not seem that Bulgaria meant to mobilize, or, if she did, it would be  against Turkey.  A little later, in answer to another Greek step, M.  Passitch, the Servian Premier, after a conference with the military  chiefs, stated that, as long as there was no imminent danger from  Bulgaria, Servia could not draw troops from the Austrian frontier,  because of her engagements towards the Entente, and that, should the  danger become imminent, Servia would have to consult first the  Entente.[2]  By Entente, he meant especially Russia, for M.  Sazonow had  already told the Greek Minister at Petrograd that it was all-important  that the Servian army should be left free to devote its whole strength  against the Austrians.[3]    Rumania, on whose co-operation Greece counted for restraining Bulgaria  and preserving the balance established by the Treaty of Bucharest,  maintained an equivocal attitude: both belligerent groups courted her,  and it was as yet uncertain which would prevail.[4]  For the present  Rumanian diplomacy was directed to the formation of a Balkan _bloc_ of  neutrality--between Rumania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece--which might  enable those four States to remain at peace with each other and the whole  world, exempt from outside interference.  The first step to the  realization of this idea, the Rumanian Government considered, was a  settlement of the differences between Greece and Turkey; and, in  compliance with its invitation, both States sent their plenipotentiaries  to Bucharest.    The only result of this mission was to enlighten the Hellenic Government  on Turkey's real attitude.  At the very first sitting, the Turkish  delegate, Talaat Bey, in answer to a remark that the best thing for the  Balkan States would be to keep out of the general conflagration, blurted  out: \"But Turkey is no longer free as to her movements\"--an avowal of the  Germano-Turkish alliance which the Greeks already knew from the Kaiser's  own indiscretions.  After that meeting, in a conversation with the  Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which that gentleman reported to  the Greeks, Talaat said that, in his opinion, Greece could ignore her  Servian alliance, for, {19} as things stood, she might find herself at  war, not only with Bulgaria, but also with Turkey--a contingency not  foreseen when that alliance was made.  From these utterances the Greeks  derived a clear impression that Talaat acted on a plan drawn up in  Berlin.[5]  For the rest, the despatch of the _Goeben_ and the _Breslau_  to Constantinople, followed by the continued arrival of German officers  and sailors for the Ottoman Navy, spoke for themselves.  M. Sazonow  shared the Greek conviction that Turkey had made up her mind, and that no  amount of concessions would avail: \"It is,\" he said to the Greek Minister  at Petrograd, \"an abscess which must burst.\" [6]  The Greeks had even  reason to suspect that Turkey was secretly negotiating an agreement with  Bulgaria, and on this point also the information of the Russian  Government confirmed theirs.[7]    It was his intimate knowledge of the Balkan situation that had inspired  King Constantine's proposal to the Entente Powers in August for common  action against Turkey, qualified with the stipulation of holding Bulgaria  in check.  The proposal took cognizance of Balkan difficulties and might  perhaps have solved them, had it been accepted: an advance of the Greek  army on Thrace, combined with a naval attack by the British Fleet, early  in September, might have settled Turkey, secured Bulgaria's neutrality,  if not indeed her co-operation, or forced her into a premature  declaration of hostility, and decided Rumania to throw in her lot with us.    But the Entente Powers were not yet ripe for action against Turkey: they  were still playing--with what degree of seriousness is a delicate  question--for the neutrality of Turkey, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22690"],[0,"Rembrandt and His Works (#5)"],[1,"kind-natured Sir, that the exact sum of money at my disposal may      be at once made clear, in order that I may at last receive the sum      of 1244 florins, long since due; as I shall always strive to      recompense such by reciprocal services, and with lasting friendship;      so that with my most cordial greetings, and the prayer that God may      long keep you in good health, and grant you bliss hereafter,          I remain,          Your Honour's            Obedient and devoted Servant,                REMBRANDT.        I am living on the Binnen Aemstel, at the Confectioner's.        10th Oct.        VAN SUYLYKEN, Esq.      Counsellor and Secretary to his Highness in the Hague.        _Per post._      We cannot reflect upon the foregoing Catalogue without regretting that  Rembrandt, in his old age, should have, like our own Milton,                          \"Fall'n on evil days,    On evil days though fall'n and evil tongues.\"      The troubles existing at that time pervaded the whole of Europe, and  works, both of poetry and painting, produced little emolument to the  possessors; consequently the whole of this rich assemblage of works of  art, the accumulation of years, fell a sacrifice to the hammer of the  auctioneer, producing little more than four thousand nine hundred  guilders. By its list, however, we are enabled to refute the assertion  of many of his biographers, that he neglected the antique, and the works  of the great masters of the Italian school, the catalogue including  casts from ancient sculpture, and drawings and prints after Michael  Angelo, Raffaelle, and Titian, which at that time were rare and of great  value. We find by a memorandum on the back of one of Rembrandt's proofs,  on India paper, of his etching of \"Christ Healing the Sick,\" which now  goes by the name of \"The Hundred Guilder Print,\" that, \"wishing to  possess a print of the Plague, by Mark Antonio, after Raffaelle, valued  by the dealer Van Zomers at a hundred florins, he gave the proof in  exchange;\" and further, \"that such proofs were never sold, but given as  presents to his friends.\" We may perceive by this the anxiety he had to  collect works that were excellent. As we do not discover amongst the  various articles enumerated, either palette or brushes, we may infer  that on quitting Amsterdam he carried off all his working apparatus.    With this short notice of his life, and these few remarks, I must now  enter into what is more properly the subject of this work, a critical  examination into his principles and practice.    [Footnote 1: Mr. Nieuwenhuys, in a note in his Life of Rembrandt,  mentions that the Directors of the Anatomical Theatre resolved to sell  this picture by auction, for the purpose of augmenting the funds for  supporting the widows of members, and in consequence the sale was  announced for Monday the 4th of August, 1828. Since the year 1632, until  this period, it had always remained in that establishment, as a gift  from Professor N. Tulp, who presented it as a remembrance of himself and  colleagues. Mr. N. had no sooner heard that the piece in question was to  be sold, than he went to Amsterdam, with the intention of purchasing  it; but, upon arriving, was informed that his Majesty, the King of the  Netherlands, had opposed the sale, and given orders to the Minister for  the Home Department to obtain it for the sum of 32,000 guldens, and  caused it to be placed in the Museum at the Hague, where it remains.  The picture is on canvas: height 64-1/2 inches, width 83-1/2 inches.]          REMBRANDT AND HIS WORKS.      The early pictures, in all ages, either merely indicate the character  of bas-reliefs or single statues,--a cold continuity of outline, and  an absence of foreshortening. The first move in advance, and that  which constitutes their pictorial character, in contradistinction to  sculpture, is an assemblage of figures, repeating the various forms  contained in the principal ones, and thus rendering them less harsh by  extension and doubling of the various shapes, as we often perceive in a  first sketch of a work, where the eye of the spectator chooses, out of  the multiplicity of outlines, those forms most agreeable to his taste.  The next step to improvement, and giving the work a more natural  appearance, is the influence of shadow, so as to make the outlines of  the prominent more distinct, and those in the background less harsh  and cutting, and consequently more retiring. The application of shadow,  however, not only renders works of art more natural, by giving the  appearance of advancing and retiring to objects represented upon a flat  surface--thus keeping them in their several situations, according to the  laws of aerial perspective--but enables the artist to draw attention to  the principal points of the story, and likewise to preserve the whole in  agreeable form, by losing and pronouncing individual parts. Coreggio was  the first who carried out this principle to any great extent; but it was  reserved for Rembrandt, by his boldness and genius, to put a limit to  its further application. Breadth, the constituent character of this mode  of treatment, cannot be extended; indeed, it is said that Rembrandt  himself extended it too far; for, absorbing seven-eighths in obscurity  and softness, though it renders the remaining portion more brilliant,  yet costs too much. This principle, however, contains the greatest  poetry of the art, in contradistinction to the severe outline and harsh  colouring of the great historical style.          COMPOSITION.      To arrive at a true knowledge of the inventions and compositions of  Rembrandt, it is necessary, in the first instance, to examine those  of Albert Durer, the Leonardo da Vinci of Germany. The inventions of  this extraordinary man are replete with the finest feelings of art,  notwithstanding the Gothic dryness and fantastic forms of his figures.  The folds of his draperies are more like creased pieces of paper than  cloth, and his representation of the naked is either bloated and  coarse, or dry and meagre. His backgrounds have all the extravagant  characteristics of a German romance, and are totally destitute of aerial  perspective; yet, with the exception of the character of the people and  scenery of Nuremburg, he is not more extravagant in his forms than the  founder of the Florentine school, and had he been educated in Italy, he  in all probability would have rivalled Raffaelle in the purity of his  design. In his journal, which he kept when he travelled into the  Netherlands, he mentions some prints he sent to Rome, in exchange for  those he expected in return, and it is mentioned that Raffaelle admired  his works highly. The multitude of his engravings, both on copper and  wood, which were spread over Germany, influenced, in a great degree,  the style of composition of those artists who came after him, and  accordingly we see many points of coincidence in the compositions of  Rembrandt. A century, however, had opened up a greater insight into the  mysteries of painting than either Leonardo da Vinci or Albert Durer ever  thought of; one alone,--viz. aerial perspective, seems to mark the line  between the ancient and modern school; for though Durer invented several  instruments for perfecting lineal perspective, his works exhibit no  attempt at giving the indistinctness of distant objects. To Rubens,  Germany and Holland were indebted for this essential part of the art, so  necessary to a true representation of Nature. This great genius, in his  contemplation of the works of Titian and others, both at Venice and in  Madrid, soon emancipated the art of his country from the Gothic hardness  of Lucas Cranach, Van Eyck, and Albert Durer; but notwithstanding his  taste and knowledge of what constituted the higher qualities of the  Italian school, the irregular combinations and multitudinous assemblage  of figures found in the early German compositions remained with him to  the last. His works are like a melodrama, filled with actors who have  no settled action or expression allotted them, while in the works of  Raffaelle, and other great composers, the persons introduced are limited  to the smallest number necessary to explain the story. This condensing  of the interest, if I may use the expression, was borrowed originally  from the Greeks, of whose sculptures the Romans availed themselves to a  great degree. On the other hand, this looseness of arrangement, and what  may be termed ornamental, not only spread through Germany, but infected  the schools of Venice; witness the works of Tintoret and Paul Veronese,  in which the expression of the countenance absolutely goes for nothing,  and the whole arrangement is drawn out in a picturesque point of view,  merely to amuse and gratify the eye of the spectator.    Now, with all these infectious examples before him, Rembrandt has done  much to concentrate the action, and reduce the number drawn out on the  canvas to the mere personages who figure in the history. Witness his  \"Salutation of the Virgin,\" in the Marquis of Westminster's collection,  which is evidently engendered from the idea contained in the design of  Albert Durer. His strict application to nature, while it enabled him  to destroy the unmeaning combinations of his predecessors, led him  into many errors, by the simple fact of drawing from the people in his  presence. But are not others chargeable with some incongruities? Are the  Madonnas of Murillo anything but a transcript of the women of Andalusia?  The women of Venice figure in the historical compositions of Titian and  Paul Veronese, and the Fornarina of Raffaelle is present in his most  sacred subjects; those, therefore, who accuse Rembrandt of vulgarity  of form, might with equal justice draw an invidious comparison between  classic Italian and high Dutch. In many of his compositions he has  embodied the highest feeling and sentiment, and in his study of natural  "]]]
