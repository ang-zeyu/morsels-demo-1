[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23997"],[0,"Eugene Oneguine [Onegin] (#5)"],[1," Are oft deceptive--like their feet.    XXXII    Where is Oneguine? Half asleep,  Straight from the ball to bed he goes,  Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep  The drum already doth arouse.  The shopman and the pedlar rise  And to the Bourse the cabman plies;  The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,(15)  Crunching the morning snow she treads;  Morning awakes with joyous sound;  The shutters open; to the skies  In column blue the smoke doth rise;  The German baker looks around  His shop, a night-cap on his head,  And pauses oft to serve out bread.    [Note 15: i.e. the milkmaid from the Okhta villages, a suburb of St.  Petersburg on the right bank of the Neva chiefly inhabited by the  labouring classes.]    XXXIII    But turning morning into night,  Tired by the ball's incessant noise,  The votary of vain delight  Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,  Late in the afternoon to rise,  When the same life before him lies  Till morn--life uniform but gay,  To-morrow just like yesterday.  But was our friend Eugene content,  Free, in the blossom of his spring,  Amidst successes flattering  And pleasure's daily blandishment,  Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare  Was he in health and void of care?--    XXXIV    Even so! His passions soon abated,  Hateful the hollow world became,  Nor long his mind was agitated  By love's inevitable flame.  For treachery had done its worst;  Friendship and friends he likewise curst,  Because he could not gourmandise  Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies  And irrigate them with champagne;  Nor slander viciously could spread  Whene'er he had an aching head;  And, though a plucky scatterbrain,  He finally lost all delight  In bullets, sabres, and in fight.    XXXV    His malady, whose cause I ween  It now to investigate is time,  Was nothing but the British spleen  Transported to our Russian clime.  It gradually possessed his mind;  Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed  To slay himself with blade or ball,  Indifferent he became to all,  And like Childe Harold gloomily  He to the festival repairs,  Nor boston nor the world's affairs  Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh  Impressed him in the least degree,--  Callous to all he seemed to be.    XXXVI    Ye miracles of courtly grace,  He left _you_ first, and I must own  The manners of the highest class  Have latterly vexatious grown;  And though perchance a lady may  Discourse of Bentham or of Say,  Yet as a rule their talk I call  Harmless, but quite nonsensical.  Then they're so innocent of vice,  So full of piety, correct,  So prudent, and so circumspect  Stately, devoid of prejudice,  So inaccessible to men,  Their looks alone produce the spleen.(16)    [Note 16: Apropos of this somewhat ungallant sentiment, a Russian  scholiast remarks:--\"The whole of this ironical stanza is but a  _refined eulogy_ of the excellent qualities of our countrywomen.  Thus Boileau, in the guise of invective, eulogizes Louis XIV.  Russian ladies unite in their persons great acquirements,  combined with amiability and strict morality; also a species of  Oriental charm which so much captivated Madame de Stael.\" It will  occur to most that the apologist of the Russian fair \"doth  protest too much.\" The poet in all probability wrote the offending  stanza in a fit of Byronic \"spleen,\" as he would most likely  himself have called it. Indeed, since Byron, poets of his school  seem to assume this virtue if they have it not, and we take their  utterances under its influence for what they are worth.]    XXXVII    And you, my youthful damsels fair,  Whom latterly one often meets  Urging your droshkies swift as air  Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,  From you too Eugene took to flight,  Abandoning insane delight,  And isolated from all men,  Yawning betook him to a pen.  He thought to write, but labour long  Inspired him with disgust and so  Nought from his pen did ever flow,  And thus he never fell among  That vicious set whom I don't blame--  Because a member I became.    XXXVIII    Once more to idleness consigned,  He felt the laudable desire  From mere vacuity of mind  The wit of others to acquire.  A case of books he doth obtain--  He reads at random, reads in vain.  This nonsense, that dishonest seems,  This wicked, that absurd he deems,  All are constrained and fetters bear,  Antiquity no pleasure gave,  The moderns of the ancients rave--  Books he abandoned like the fair,  His book-shelf instantly doth drape  With taffety instead of crape.    XXXIX    Having abjured the haunts of men,  Like him renouncing vanity,  His friendship I acquired just then;  His character attracted me.  An innate love of meditation,  Original imagination,  And cool sagacious mind he had:  I was incensed and he was sad.  Both were of passion satiate  And both of dull existence tired,  Extinct the flame which once had fired;  Both were expectant of the hate  With which blind Fortune oft betrays  The very morning of our days.    XL    He who hath lived and living, thinks,  Must e'en despise his kind at last;  He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks  From shades of the relentless past.  No fond illusions live to soothe,  But memory like a serpent's tooth  With late repentance gnaws and stings.  All this in many cases brings  A charm with it in conversation.  Oneguine's speeches I abhorred  At first, but soon became inured  To the sarcastic observation,  To witticisms and taunts half-vicious  And gloomy epigrams malicious.    XLI    How oft, when on a summer night  Transparent o'er the Neva beamed  The firmament in mellow light,  And when the watery mirror gleamed  No more with pale Diana's rays,(17)  We called to mind our youthful days--  The days of love and of romance!  Then would we muse as in a trance,  Impressionable for an hour,  And breathe the balmy breath of night;  And like the prisoner's our delight  Who for the greenwood quits his tower,  As on the rapid wings of thought  The early days of life we sought.    [Note 17: The midsummer nights in the latitude of St. Petersburg  are a prolonged twilight.]    XLII    Absorbed in melancholy mood  And o'er the granite coping bent,  Oneguine meditative stood,  E'en as the poet says he leant.(18)  'Tis silent all! Alone the cries  Of the night sentinels arise  And from the Millionaya afar(19)  The sudden rattling of a car.  Lo! on the sleeping river borne,  A boat with splashing oar floats by,  And now we hear delightedly  A jolly song and distant horn;  But sweeter in a midnight dream  Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.    [Note 18: Refers to Mouravieff's \"Goddess of the Neva.\" At St.  Petersburg the banks of the Neva are lined throughout with  splendid granite quays.]    [Note 19:  A street running parallel to the Neva, and leading from  the Winter Palace to the Summer Palace and Garden.]    XLIII    Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,  O Brenta, once more we shall meet  And, inspiration firing me,  Your magic voices I shall greet,  Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,  And after Albion's proud lyre (20)  Possess my love and sympathy.  The nights of golden Italy  I'll pass beneath the firmament,  Hid in the gondola's dark shade,  Alone with my Venetian maid,  Now talkative, now reticent;  From her my lips shall learn the tongue  Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.    [Note 20: The strong influence exercised by Byron's genius on the  imagination of Pushkin is well known. Shakespeare and other  English dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,  which, at all events in its earlier developments, was of an  essentially imitative type. As an example of his Shakespearian  tastes, see his poem of \"Angelo,\" founded upon \"Measure for Measure.\"]    XLIV    When will my hour of freedom come!  Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales  Awaiting on the shore I roam  And beckon to the passing sails.  Upon the highway of the sea  When shall I wing my passage free  On waves by tempests curdled o'er!  'Tis time to quit this weary shore  So uncongenial to my mind,  To dream upon the sunny strand  Of Africa, ancestral land,(21)  Of dreary Russia left behind,  Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,  Wherein I buried left my heart.    [Note 21: The poet was, on his mother's side, of African extraction,  a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of  his imagination. His great-grandfather, Abraham Petrovitch Hannibal,  was seized on the coast of Africa when eight years of age by a  corsair, and carried a slave to Constantinople. The Russian  Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused  him to be baptized at Vilnius. Subsequently one of Hannibal's  brothers made his way to Constantinople and thence to St. Petersburg  for the purpose of ransoming him; but Peter would not surrender his  godson who died at the age of ninety-two, having attained the rank  of general in the Russian service.]    XLV    Eugene designed with me to start  And visit many a foreign clime,  But Fortune cast our lots apart  For a protracted space of time.  Just at that time his father died,  And soon Oneguine's door beside  Of creditors a hungry rout  Their claims and explanations shout.  But Eugene, hating litigation  And with his lot in life content,  To a surrender gave consent,  Seeing in this no deprivation,  Or counting on his uncle's death  And what the old man might bequeath.    XLVI    And in reality one day  The steward sent a note to tell  How sick to death his uncle lay  And wished to say to him farewell.  Having this mournful document  Perused, Eugene in postchaise went  And hastened to his uncle's side,  But in his heart dissatisfied,  Having for money's sake alone  Sorrow to counterfeit and wail--  Thus we began our little tale--  But, to his uncle's mansion flown,  He found him on the table laid,  A due which must to earth be paid.    XLVII    The courtyard full of serfs he sees,  And from the country all around  Had come both friends and enemies--  Funeral amateurs abound!  The body they consigned to rest,  And then made merry pope and guest, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2400"],[0,"Vikram and the Vampire: Classic Hindu Tales of Adventure, Magic, and Romance (#5)"],[1,"husband, we are old,  and what are the enjoyments of the stricken in years? Truly quoth the  poet--                   Die loved in youth, not hated in age.    If that fruit could have restored thy dimmed eyes, and deaf ears, and  blunted taste, and warmth of love, I had not spoken to thee thus.\"    After which the Brahman threw away the apple, to the great joy of his  wife, who felt a natural indignation at the prospect of seeing her  goodman become immortal, whilst she still remained subject to the laws  of death; but she concealed this motive in the depths of her thought,  enlarging, as women are apt to do, upon everything but the truth. And  she spoke with such success, that the priest was about to toss in his  rage the heavenly fruit into the fire, reproaching the gods as if by  sending it they had done him an injury. Then the wife snatched it out  of his hand, and telling him it was too precious to be wasted, bade him  arise and gird his loins and wend him to the Regent's palace, and  offer him the fruit--as King Vikram was absent--with a right reverend  brahmanical benediction. She concluded with impressing upon her  unworldly husband the necessity of requiring a large sum of money as a  return for his inestimable gift. \"By this means,\" she said, \"thou mayst  promote thy present and future welfare.[27]\"    Then the Brahman went forth, and standing in the presence of the Raja,  told him all things touching the fruit, concluding with \"O, mighty  prince! vouchsafe to accept this tribute, and bestow wealth upon me. I  shall be happy in your living long!\"    Bhartari Raja led the supplicant into an inner strongroom, where stood  heaps of the finest gold-dust, and bade him carry away all that he  could; this the priest did, not forgetting to fill even his eloquent and  toothless mouth with the precious metal. Having dismissed the devotee  groaning under the burden, the Regent entered the apartments of his  wives, and having summoned the beautiful Queen Dangalah Rani, gave her  the fruit, and said, \"Eat this, light of my eyes! This fruit--joy of my  heart!--will make thee everlastingly young and beautiful.\"    The pretty queen, placing both hands upon her husband's bosom, kissed  his eyes and lips, and sweetly smiling on his face--for great is the  guile of women--whispered, \"Eat it thyself, dear one, or at least share  it with me; for what is life and what is youth without the presence of  those we love?\" But the Raja, whose heart was melted by these unusual  words, put her away tenderly, and, having explained that the fruit would  serve for only one person, departed.    Whereupon the pretty queen, sweetly smiling as before, slipped the  precious present into her pocket. When the Regent was transacting  business in the hall of audience she sent for the ambassador who  regulated war and peace, and presented him with the apple in a manner at  least as tender as that with which it had been offered to her.    Then the ambassador, after slipping the fruit into his pocket also,  retired from the presence of the pretty queen, and meeting Lakha, one of  the maids of honour, explained to her its wonderful power, and gave  it to her as a token of his love. But the maid of honour, being an  ambitious girl, determined that the fruit was a fit present to set  before the Regent in the absence of the King. Bhartari Raja accepted it,  bestowed on her great wealth, and dismissed her with many thanks.    He then took up the apple and looked at it with eyes brimful of tears,  for he knew the whole extent of his misfortune. His heart ached, he felt  a loathing for the world, and he said with sighs and groans[28]:    \"Of what value are these delusions of wealth and affection, whose  sweetness endures for a moment and becomes eternal bitterness? Love is  like the drunkard's cup: delicious is the first drink, palling are the  draughts that succeed it, and most distasteful are the dregs. What is  life but a restless vision of imaginary pleasures and of real pains,  from which the only waking is the terrible day of death? The affection  of this world is of no use, since, in consequence of it, we fall at last  into hell. For which reason it is best to practice the austerities of  religion, that the Deity may bestow upon us hereafter that happiness  which he refuses to us here!\"    Thus did Bhartari Raja determine to abandon the world. But before  setting out for the forest, he could not refrain from seeing the queen  once more, so hot was the flame which Kama had kindled in his heart.  He therefore went to the apartments of his women, and having caused  Dangalah Rani to be summoned, he asked her what had become of the fruit  which he had given to her. She answered that, according to his command,  she had eaten it. Upon which the Regent showed her the apple, and she  beholding it stood aghast, unable to make any reply. The Raja gave  careful orders for her beheading; he then went out, and having had the  fruit washed, ate it. He quitted the throne to be a jogi, or religious  mendicant, and without communicating with any one departed into the  jungle. There he became such a devotee that death had no power over him,  and he is wandering still. But some say that he was duly absorbed into  the essence of the Deity.          *     *     *     *     *     *    We are next told how the valiant Vikram returned to his own country.    Thus Vikram's throne remained empty. When the news reached King Indra,  Regent of the Lower Firmament and Protector of Earthly Monarchs, he sent  Prithwi Pala, a fierce giant,[29] to defend the city of Ujjayani till  such time as its lawful master might reappear, and the guardian used to  keep watch and ward night and day over his trust.    In less than a year the valorous Raja Vikram became thoroughly tired of  wandering about the woods half dressed: now suffering from famine, then  exposed to the attacks of wild beasts, and at all times very ill at  ease. He reflected also that he was not doing his duty to his wives and  children; that the heir-apparent would probably make the worst use of  the parental absence; and finally, that his subjects, deprived of his  fatherly care, had been left in the hands of a man who, for ought he  could say, was not worthy of the high trust. He had also spied out  all the weak points of friend and foe. Whilst these and other equally  weighty considerations were hanging about the Raja's mind, he heard a  rumour of the state of things spread abroad; that Bhartari, the regent,  having abdicated his throne, had gone away into the forest. Then quoth  Vikram to his son, \"We have ended our wayfarings, now let us turn our  steps homewards!\"    The gong was striking the mysterious hour of midnight as the king and  the young prince approached the principal gate. And they were pushing  through it when a monstrous figure rose up before them and called out  with a fearful voice, \"Who are ye, and where are ye going? Stand and  deliver your names!\"    \"I am Raja Vikram,\" rejoined the king, half choked with rage, \"and I am  come to mine own city. Who art thou that darest to stop or stay me?\"    \"That question is easily answered,\" cried Prithwi Pala the giant, in his  roaring voice; \"the gods have sent me to protect Ujjayani. If thou be  really Raja Vikram, prove thyself a man: first fight with me, and then  return to thine own.\"    The warrior king cried \"Sadhu!\" wanting nothing better. He girt his  girdle tight round his loins, summoned his opponent into the empty space  beyond the gate, told him to stand on guard, and presently began to  devise some means of closing with or running in upon him. The giant's  fists were large as watermelons, and his knotted arms whistled through  the air like falling trees, threatening fatal blows. Besides which the  Raja's head scarcely reached the giant's stomach, and the latter, each  time he struck out, whooped so abominably loud, that no human nerves  could remain unshaken.    At last Vikram's good luck prevailed. The giant's left foot slipped, and  the hero, seizing his antagonist's other leg, began to trip him up. At  the same moment the young prince, hastening to his parent's assistance,  jumped viciously upon the enemy's naked toes. By their united exertions  they brought him to the ground, when the son sat down upon his stomach,  making himself as weighty as he well could, whilst the father, climbing  up to the monster's throat, placed himself astride upon it, and pressing  both thumbs upon his eyes, threatened to blind him if he would not  yield.    Then the giant, modifying the bellow of his voice, cried out--    \"O Raja, thou hast overthrown me, and I grant thee thy life.\"    \"Surely thou art mad, monster,\" replied the king, in jeering tone, half  laughing, half angry. \"To whom grantest thou life? If I desire it I can  kill thee; how, then, cost thou talk about granting me my life?\"    \"Vikram of Ujjayani,\" said the giant, \"be not too proud! I will save  thee from a nearly impending death. Only hearken to the tale which I  have to tell thee, and use thy judgment, and act upon it. So shalt  thou rule the world free from care, and live without danger, and die  happily.\"    \"Proceed,\" quoth the Raja, after a moment's thought, dismounting from  the giant's throat, and beginning to listen with all his ears.    The giant raised himself from the ground, and when in a sitting posture,  began in solemn tones to speak as follows:    \"In short, the history of the matter is, that three men were born in  this same city of Ujjayani, in the same lunar mansion, in the same  division of the great circle described upon the ecliptic, and in the  same period of time. You, the first, were born in the house of a king.  The second was an oilman's son, who was slain by the third, a jogi,  or anchorite, who kills all he can, wafting the sweet scent of human  sacrifice to the nostrils of Durga, goddess of destruction. Moreover,  the holy man, after compassing the death of the "]]]
