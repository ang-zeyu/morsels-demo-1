No  repairing could be done after the ice made; and if the dam should give  way at any time during the winter, the pond would be drained, and the  entrances of the lodge and the burrow would be thrown open to any  prowling marauders that might happen to pass that way. So it was  imperative to have things in good order before cold weather came on.    There came a quiet, windless day, when the sky was gray, and when the  big snow-flakes came floating lazily down, some to lose themselves in  the black water, and some to robe the woods and the shores in white. At  nightfall the clouds broke up, the stars shone forth, and the air grew  odder and keener till long crystal spears shot out across the pond, and  before morning a sheet of glass had spread from shore to shore. I do not  think it was unwelcome. The beavers were shut in for the winter, or  could only go abroad with considerable difficulty, but they had each  other, and there was a little world of their own down under the ice and  snow. The chamber of the lodge was home, and just outside was their food  storehouse--the big pile of wood which it had cost so much labor to  gather. One of the entrances was shorter and straighter than the other,  and through this they used to bring in sticks from the heap, and lay  them on the floor between the beds, where they could devour the bark at  their leisure. If they grew restless, and wanted to go farther afield,  there was the bottom of the pond to be explored, and the big luscious  lily-roots to be dug up for a change of diet. It was a peaceful time, a  time of rest from the labors of the past year, and of growing fat and  strong for those of the year to come. We have much goods laid up for  many months; let us eat, drink, and be merry, and hope that the trappers  will not come to-morrow.    The babies came in May, and I suppose that the young father and mother  were almost as proud and happy as some of you who are in similar  circumstances. The Beaver did not wander very far from home that spring  and summer, nor was he away very long at a time.    There were five of the children, and they were very pretty--about as  large as rats, and covered with thick, soft, silky, reddish-brown fur,  but without any of the longer, coarser, chestnut-colored hairs that  formed their parents' outer coats. They were very playful, too, as the  father and mother had been in their own youthful days. For a while they  had to be nursed, like other babies; but by and by the old beavers began  to bring in little twigs for them, about the size of lead-pencils; and  if you had been there, and your eyes had been sharp enough to pierce the  gloom, you might have seen the youngsters exercising their brand new  teeth, and learning to sit up and hold sticks in their baby hands while  they ate the bark. And wouldn't you have liked to be present on the  night when they first went swimming down the long, dark tunnel; and,  rising to the surface, looked around on their world of woods and  water--on the quiet pond, with its glassy smoothness broken only by  their own ripples; on the tall trees, lifting their fingers toward the  sky; and on the stars, marching silently across the heavens, and looking  down with still, unwinking eyes on another family of babies that had  come to live and love and be happy for a little while on God's earth?    One of the children was killed by an otter before the summer was over,  but I am glad to say that the other four grew up and were a credit to  their parents.    The babies were not the only addition to the new city during that year,  for about mid-summer another pair of beavers came and built a lodge near  the upper end of the pond. It was a busy season for everybody--for our  old friends as well as for the new-comers. The food-sticks which had  been peeled off their bark during the winter furnished a good supply of  construction material, and the dam was built up several inches higher,  and was lengthened to the buttress-tree on one side, and for a distance  of two or three rods on the other, so as to keep the water from flowing  around the ends. As the water-level rose it became necessary to build up  the floor of the lodge in order to keep it from being flooded; and that,  in turn, necessitated raising the roof by the simple process of  hollowing it out from within and adding more material on the outside. In  the same way the lodge was made both longer and broader, to accommodate  the growing family and the still further increase that was to be  expected the following spring. More burrows were dug in the shore of  the pond--you can't have too many of them--and a much larger stock of  food wood was gathered, for there were six mouths, instead of two, to be  fed through the coming winter. The father and mother worked very hard,  and even the babies helped with the lighter tasks, such as carrying home  small branches, and mending little leaks in the dam. The second pair of  beavers was also busy with lodge and burrow and storehouse, and so the  days slipped by very rapidly.    Only once that year did a man come to town, and then he did not do  anything very dreadful. He was not a trapper, he was only an amateur  naturalist who wanted to see the beavers at their work, and who thought  he was smart enough to catch them at it. His plan was simple enough; he  made a breach in the dam one night, and then climbed a tree and waited  for them to come and mend it. It was bright moonlight, and he thought he  would see the whole thing and learn some wonderful secrets.    The Beaver was at work in the woods not very far away, and presently he  came down to the edge of the pond, rolling a heavy birch cutting before  him. He noticed at once that the water was falling, and he started  straight for the dam to see what was the matter. The amateur naturalist  saw him coming, a dark speck moving swiftly down the pond, with a long  V-shaped ripple spreading out behind him like the flanks of a flock of  wild geese. But the beaver was doing some thinking while he swam. He had  never before known the water to fall so suddenly and rapidly; there must  be a very bad break in the dam. How could it have happened? It looked  suspicious. It looked very suspicious indeed; and just before he reached  the dam he stopped to reconnoitre, and at once caught sight of the  naturalist up in the tree. His tail rose in the air and came down with  the loudest whack that had ever echoed across the pond, a stroke that  sent the spray flying in every direction, and that might have been heard  three-quarters of a mile away. His wife heard it, and paused in her work  of felling a tree; the children heard it, and the neighbors heard it;  and they all knew it meant business. The Beaver dived like a loon and  swam for dear life, and he did not come to the surface again till he had  reached the farther end of the pond and was out of sight behind a grassy  point. There he stayed, now and then striking the water with his tail  as a signal that the danger was not yet over. It isn't every animal that  can use his caudal appendage as a stool, as a rudder, as a third hind  leg, as a trowel for smoothing the floor of his house, and as a tocsin  for alarming his fellow-citizens.    The naturalist roosted in the tree till his teeth were chattering and he  was fairly blue with cold, and then he scrambled down and went back to  his camp, where he had a violent chill. The next night it rained, and as  he did not want to get wet there was nothing to do but stay in his tent.  When he visited the pond again the dam had been repaired and the water  was up to its usual level. He decided that watching beavers wasn't very  interesting, hardly worth the trouble it cost; and he guessed he knew  enough about them, anyhow. So the next day he packed up his camping  outfit and went home.    In the following year the population was increased to eighteen, for six  more babies arrived in our Beaver's lodge, and four in his neighbors'.  In another twelvemonth the first four were old enough to build lodges  and found homes of their own; and so the city grew, and our Beaver and  his wife were the original inhabitants, the first settlers, the most  looked-up-to of all the citizens. You are not to suppose, however, that  the Beaver was mayor of the town. There was no city government. The  family was the unit, and each household was a law unto itself. But that  did not keep him from being the oldest, the wisest, the most knowing of  all the beavers in the community, just as his father had been before him  in another town.    I don't believe you care to hear all about the years that followed. They  were years of peace and growth, of marriages and homebuilding, of many  births and a few deaths, of winter rest and summer labor, and of quiet  domestic happiness. There was little excitement, and, best of all, there  were no trappers. The time came when the Beaver might well say, as he  looked around on the community which he and his wife had founded, that  he was a citizen of no mean city.    But this could not last. A great calamity was coming--a calamity beside  which the slow destruction of the former town would seem tame and  uninteresting.    One bright February day the Beaver and his wife left their lodge to look  for lily-roots. They had found a big fat one and were just about to  begin their feast, when they heard foot-steps on the ice over their  heads, and the voices of several men talking eagerly. They made for the  nearest burrow as fast as they could go, and stayed there the rest of  the day, and when they returned to their lodge they found--but I'm going  too fast.    The men were Indians and half-breeds, and they were in high feather over  their discovery.

The colour is of a deep brown,  nearly black on the head, and lighter about the neck and shoulders. The  legs are firm and muscular; the tail is short, with a tuft at the end.    The female is, in every respect, much smaller than the male; her horns  are more slender, and the hair on her neck and shoulders is not so thick  or long, nor the colour so dark. She brings forth in the spring, and  rarely more than one. The calves continue to be suckled nearly twelve  months, and follow the cows for a much longer period. It is said that  the cows are not unfrequently followed by the calves of two, or even  three, breeding seasons.    These animals, both male and female, are timid and shy, notwithstanding  their fierce appearance; unless they are wounded, or during the breeding  season, when it is dangerous to approach. Their mode of attack is to  throw down, by pushing, as they run with their head; then to crush, by  trampling their enemy under their fore-feet, which, surmounted as they  are, by their tremendous head and shoulder, form most effectual weapons  of destruction.    [Illustration: Young female Bison, after Cuvier.]    The following account, by Dr. Richardson, affords an instance of the  danger to be apprehended from these powerful animals, when wounded, and  not disabled: \"Mr. Finnan M'Donald, one of the Hudson's Bay Company's  clerks was descending the Saskatchewan in a boat; and one evening,  having pitched his tent for the night, he went out in the dusk to look  for game. It had become nearly dark when he fired at a Bison bull, which  was galloping over an eminence; and as he was hastening forward to see  if this shot had taken effect, the wounded beast made a rush at him. He  had the presence of mind to seize the animal by the long hair on the  forehead, as it struck him on the side with its horn, and being a  remarkably tall and powerful man, a struggle ensued, which continued  until his wrist was severely sprained, and his arm was rendered  powerless; he then fell, and after receiving two or three blows, became  senseless. Shortly afterwards he was found by his companions, lying  bathed in his blood, being gored in several places, and the Bison was  couched beside him, apparently waiting to renew the attack, had he shown  any signs of life. Mr. M'Donald recovered from the immediate effects of  the injuries, but he died a few months afterwards. Many instances might  be mentioned of the tenaciousness with which this animal pursues its  revenge; and I have been told of a hunter being detained for many hours  in a tree, by an old bull, which had taken its post below, to watch  him.\"    [Illustration: Wounded Bison, after Catlin.]    The capture of the Bison is effected in various ways, chiefly with the  rifle, and on foot. Their sense of smelling, however, is so acute, that  they are extremely difficult of approach, scenting their enemy from  afar, and retiring with the greatest precipitation. Care, therefore,  must be taken to go against the wind, in which case they may be  approached very near, being almost blinded by the long hair hanging over  their foreheads. The hunters generally aim at the shoulder, which, if  effectually hit, causes them to drop at once; otherwise they are  infuriated, and become dangerous antagonists, as was proved in the  result of Mr. M'Donald's adventure.    When flying before their pursuers, it would be in vain for the foremost  to halt, or attempt to obstruct the progress of the main body, as the  throng in the rear, still rushing onwards, the leaders must advance,  although destruction await the movement. The Indians take advantage of  this circumstance to destroy great quantities of this favorite game; and  certainly no method could be resorted to more effectually destructive,  nor could a more terrible devastation be produced, than that of forcing  a numerous herd of these large animals to leap from the brink of a  dreadful precipice upon a rocky and broken surface, a hundred feet  below.    When the Indians determine to destroy Bisons in this way, one of their  swiftest-footed and most active young men is selected, who is disguised  in a Bison skin, having the head, ears, and horns adjusted on his own  head, so as to make the deception very complete; and thus accoutred, he  stations himself between the Bison herd and some of the precipices,  which often extend for several miles along the rivers. The Indians  surround the herd as nearly as possible, when, at a given signal, they  show themselves, and rush forward with loud yells. The animals being  alarmed, and seeing no way open but in the direction of the disguised  Indian, run towards him, and he, taking to flight, dashes on to the  precipice, where he suddenly secures himself in some previously  ascertained crevice. The foremost of the herd arrives at the  brink,--there is no possibility of retreat, no chance of escape; the  foremost may, for an instant, shrink with terror, but the crowd behind,  who are terrified by the approaching hunters, rush forward with  increasing impetuosity, and the aggregate force hurls them successively  into the gulf, where certain death awaits them.    Sometimes they are taken by the following method:--A great number of men  divide and form a vast square; each band then sets fire to the dry grass  of the savannah, where the herds are feeding; seeing the fire advance on  all sides, they retire in great consternation to the centre of the  square; the men then close and kill them without the least hazard.    Great numbers are also taken in pounds, constructed with an embankment  of such an elevation as to prevent the return of the Bisons when once  they are driven into it. A general slaughter then takes place with  rifles or arrows.    The following vivid sketch is from the narrative of John Tanner, who,  when about seven or eight years of age, was stolen from his parents by  the Indians, and remained with them during a period of thirty years.    \"By the end of the second day after we left Pembinah we had not a  mouthful to eat, and were beginning to be very hungry. When we laid down  in our camp (near Craneberry River) at night, and put our ears close to  the ground, we could hear the tramp of the buffaloes, but when we sat up  we could hear nothing; and on the following morning nothing could be  seen of them; though we could command a very extensive view of the  prairie. As we knew they must not be far off in the direction of the  sounds we had heard, eight men, of whom I was one, were selected and  dispatched to kill some, and bring the meat to a point where it was  agreed the party should stop next night. The noise we could still hear  next morning, by applying our ears to the ground; and it seemed about as  far distant, and in the same direction, as before. We started early, and  rode some hours before we could begin to see them; and when we first  discovered the margin of the herd, it must have been at least ten miles  distant. It was like a black line drawn along the edge of the sky, or a  low shore seen across a lake. The distance of the herd from the place  where we first heard them could not have been less than twenty miles.  But it was now the rutting season, and various parts of the herd were  all the time kept in rapid motion by the severe fights of the bulls. To  the noise produced by the knocking together of the two divisions of the  hoof, when they raised their feet from the ground, and of their  incessant tramping, was added the loud and furious roar of the bulls,  engaged, as they all were, in their terrific and appalling conflicts. We  were conscious that our approach to the herd would not occasion the  alarm now, that it would at any other time, and we rode directly towards  them. As we came near we killed a wounded bull, which scarcely made an  effort to escape from us. He had wounds in his flanks, into which I  could put my whole hand. As we knew that the flesh of the bulls was not  now good to eat, we did not wish to kill them, though we might easily  have shot any number. Dismounting, we put our horses in the care of some  of our number, who were willing to stay back for that purpose, and then  crept into the herd to try to kill some cows. I had separated from the  others, and advancing, got entangled among the bulls. Before I found an  opportunity to shoot a cow, the bulls began to fight very near me. In  their fury they were totally unconscious of my presence, and came  rushing towards me with such violence, that in some alarm for my safety,  I took refuge in one of those holes which are so frequent where those  animals abound, and which they themselves dig to wallow in. Here I found  they were pressing directly upon me, and I was compelled to fire to  disperse them, in which I did not succeed until I had killed four of  them. By this firing the cows were so frightened, that I perceived I  should not be able to kill any in this quarter; so regaining my horse, I  rode to a distant part of the herd, where the Indians had succeeded in  killing a fat cow. But from this cow, as is usual in similar cases, the  herd had all moved off, except one bull, who, when I came up, still kept  the Indians at bay. 'You are warriors,' said I, as I rode up, 'going far  from your own country, to seek an enemy, but you cannot take his wife  from that old bull, who has nothing in his hands.' So saying, I passed  them directly towards the bull, then standing something more than two  hundred yards distant. He no sooner saw me approach, than he came  plunging towards me with such impetuosity, that, knowing the danger to  my horse and myself, I turned and fled. The Indians laughed heartily at  my repulse, but they did not give over their attempts to get at the cow.  By dividing the attention of the bull, and creeping up to him on  different sides, they at length shot him down. While we were cutting up  the cow, the herd were at no great distance; and an old cow,"]]]
