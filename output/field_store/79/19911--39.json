This is the hammer, as Jeremiah says, 23,  29: Is not My Word like a hammer that breaketh the rock in  pieces? This is not activa contritio or manufactured  repentance, but passiva contritio [torture of conscience],  true sorrow of heart, suffering and sensation of death.    This, then, is what it means to begin true repentance; and  here man must hear such a sentence as this: You are all of no  account, whether you be manifest sinners or saints [in your  own opinion]; you all must become different and do otherwise  than you now are and are doing [no matter what sort of people  you are], whether you are as great, wise, powerful, and holy  as you may. Here no one is [righteous, holy], godly, etc.    But to this office the New Testament immediately adds the  consolatory promise of grace through the Gospel, which must be  believed, as Christ declares, Mark 1,15: Repent and believe  the Gospel, i.e., become different and do otherwise, and  believe My promise. And John, preceding Him, is called a  preacher of repentance, however, for the remission of sins,  i.e., John was to accuse all, and convict them of being  sinners, that they might know what they were before God, and  might acknowledge that they were lost men, and might thus be  prepared for the Lord, to receive grace, and to expect and  accept from Him the remission of sins. Thus also Christ  Himself says, Luke 24, 47: Repentance and remission of sins  must be preached in My name among all nations.    But whenever the Law alone, without the Gospel being added  exercises this its office there is [nothing else than] death  and hell, and man must despair, like Saul and Judas; as St.  Paul, Rom. 7, 10, says: Through sin the Law killeth. On the  other hand, the Gospel brings consolation and remission not  only in one way, but through the word and Sacraments, and the  like, as we shall hear afterward in order that [thus] there is  with the Lord plenteous redemption, as Ps. 130, 7 says against  the dreadful captivity of sin.    However, we must now contrast the false repentance of the  sophists with true repentance, in order that both may be the  better understood.    Of the False Repentance of the Papists.    It was impossible that they should teach correctly concerning  repentance, since they did not [rightly] know the real sins  [the real sin]. For, as has been shown above, they do not  believe aright concerning original sin, but say that the  natural powers of man have remained [entirely] unimpaired and  incorrupt; that reason can teach aright, and the will can in  accordance therewith do aright [perform those things which are  taught], that God certainly bestows His grace when a man does  as much as is in him, according to his free will.    It had to follow thence [from this dogma] that they did [must  do] penance only for actual sins such as wicked thoughts to  which a person yields (for wicked emotion [concupiscence,  vicious feelings, and inclinations], lust and improper  dispositions [according to them] are not sins ), and for  wicked words and wicked deeds, which free will could readily  have omitted.    And of such repentance they fix three parts contrition,  confession, and satisfaction, with this [magnificent]  consolation and promise added: If man truly repent, [feel  remorse,] confess, render satisfaction, he thereby would have  merited forgiveness, and paid for his sins before God [atoned  for his sins and obtained a plenary redemption]. Thus in  repentance they instructed men to repose confidence in their  own works. Hence the expression originated, which was employed  in the pulpit when public absolution was announced to the  people: Prolong O God, my life, until I shall make  satisfaction for my sins and amend my life.    There was here [profound silence and] no mention of Christ nor  faith; but men hoped by their own works to overcome and blot  out sins before God. And with this intention we became priests  and monks, that we might array ourselves against sin.    As to contrition, this is the way it was done: Since no one  could remember all his sins (especially as committed through  an entire year), they inserted this provision, namely, that if  an unknown sin should be remembered later [if the remembrance  of a concealed sin should perhaps return], this also must be  repented of and confessed etc. Meanwhile they were [the person  was] commended to the grace of God.    Moreover, since no one could know how great the contrition  ought to be in order to be sufficient before God, they gave  this consolation: He who could not have contrition, at least  ought to have attrition, which I may call half a contrition or  the beginning of contrition, for they have themselves  understood neither of these terms nor do they understand them  now, as little as I. Such attrition was reckoned as contrition  when a person went to confession.    And when it happened that any one said that he could not have  contrition nor lament his sins (as might have occurred in  illicit love or the desire for revenge, etc.), they asked  whether he did not wish or desire to have contrition [lament].  When one would reply Yes (for who, save the devil himself,  would here say No?), they accepted this as contrition, and  forgave him his sins on account of this good work of his  [which they adorned with the name of contrition]. Here they  cited the example of St. Bernard, etc.    Here we see how blind reason, in matters pertaining to God,  gropes about, and, according to its own imagination, seeks for  consolation in its own works, and cannot think of [entirely  forgets] Christ and faith. But if it be [clearly] viewed in  the light, this contrition is a manufactured and fictitious  thought [or imagination], derived from man's own powers,  without faith and without the knowledge of Christ. And in it  the poor sinner, when he reflected upon his own lust and  desire for revenge, would sometimes [perhaps] have laughed  rather than wept [either laughed or wept, rather than to think  of something else], except such as either had been truly  struck by [the lightning of] the Law, or had been vainly vexed  by the devil with a sorrowful spirit. Otherwise [with the  exception of these persons] such contrition was certainly mere  hypocrisy, and did not mortify the lust for sins [flames of  sin]; for they had to grieve, while they would rather have  continued to sin, if it had been free to them.    As regards confession, the procedure was this: Every one had  [was enjoined] to enumerate all his sins (which is an  impossible thing). This was a great torment. From such as he  had forgotten [But if any one had forgotten some sins] he  would be absolved on the condition that, if they would occur  to him, he must still confess them. In this way he could never  know whether he had made a sufficiently pure confession  [perfectly and correctly], or when confessing would ever have  an end. Yet he was pointed to his own works, and comforted  thus: The more fully [sincerely and frankly] one confesses,  and the more he humiliates himself and debases himself before  the priest, the sooner and better he renders satisfaction for  his sins; for such humility certainly would earn grace before  God.    Here, too, there was no faith nor Christ, and the virtue of  the absolution was not declared to him, but upon his  enumeration of sins and his self-abasement depended his  consolation. What torture, rascality, and idolatry such  confession has produced is more than can be related.    As to satisfaction, this is by far the most involved  [perplexing] part of all. For no man could know how much to  render for a single sin, not to say how much for all. Here  they have resorted to the device of imposing a small  satisfaction, which could indeed be rendered, as five  Paternosters, a day's fast, etc.; for the rest [that was  lacking] of the [in their] repentance they were directed to  purgatory.    Here, too, there was nothing but anguish and [extreme] misery.  [For] some thought that they would never get out of purgatory,  because, according to the old canons seven years' repentance  is required for a single mortal sin. Nevertheless, confidence  was placed upon our work of satisfaction, and if the  satisfaction could have been perfect, confidence would have  been placed in it entirely, and neither faith nor Christ would  have been of use. But this confidence was impossible. For  although any one had done penance in that way for a hundred  years, he would still not have known whether he had finished  his penance. That meant forever to do penance and never to  come to repentance.    Here now the Holy See at Rome, coming to the aid of the poor  Church, invented indulgences, whereby it forgave and remitted  [expiation or] satisfaction, first, for a single instance, for  seven years, for a hundred years and distributed them among  the cardinals and bishops, so that one could grant indulgence  for a hundred years and another for a hundred days. But he  reserved to himself alone the power to remit the entire  satisfaction.    Now, since this began to yield money, and the traffic in bulls  became profitable he devised the golden jubilee year [a truly  goldbearing year], and fixed it at Rome. He called this the  remission of all punishment and guilt. Then the people came  running, because every one would fain have been freed from  this grievous, unbearable burden. This meant to find [dig up]  and raise the treasures of the earth. Immediately the Pope  pressed still further, and multiplied the golden years one  upon another. But the more he devoured money, the wider grew  his maw.    Later, therefore, he issued them [those golden years of his]  by his legates [everywhere] to the countries, until all  churches and houses were full of the Golden Year. At last he  also made an inroad into purgatory among the dead, first, by  founding masses and vigils, afterwards, by indulgences and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27341"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 4, June 1906 (#5)"],[1,"concepts of cause and effect!--And  _not_ an attack with the fists, with the knife, with honesty in hate and  love!

BRAIN WORK AND MANUAL WORK.    By PETER KROPOTKIN.      IN olden times men of science, and especially those who have done most  to forward the growth of natural philosophy, did not despise manual work  and handicraft. Galileo made his telescopes with his own hands. Newton  learned in his boyhood the art of managing tools; he exercised his young  mind in contriving most ingenious machines, and when he began his  researches in optics he was able himself to grind the lenses for his  instruments, and himself to make the well-known telescope, which, for  its time, was a fine piece of workmanship. Leibnitz was fond of  inventing machines: windmills and carriages to be moved without horses  preoccupied his mind as much as mathematical and philosophical  speculations. Linnaeus became a botanist while helping his father--a  practical gardener--in his daily work. In short, with our great geniuses  handicraft was no obstacle to abstract researches--it rather favored  them. On the other hand, if the workers of old found but few  opportunities for mastering science, many of them had, at least, their  intelligences stimulated by the very variety of work which was performed  in the then unspecialized workshops; and some of them had the benefit of  familiar intercourse with men of science. Watt and Rennie were friends  with Professor Robinson; Brindley, the road-maker, despite his  fourteen-pence-a-day wages, enjoyed intercourse with educated men, and  thus developed his remarkable engineering faculties; the son of a  well-to-do family could \"idle\" at a wheelwright's shop, so as to become  later on a Smeaton or a Stephenson.    We have changed all that. Under the pretext of division of labor, we  have sharply separated the brain worker from the manual worker. The  masses of the workmen do not receive more scientific education than  their grandfathers did; but they have been deprived of the education of  even the small workshop, while their boys and girls are driven into a  mine or a factory from the age of thirteen, and there they soon forget  the little they may have learned at school. As to the men of science,  they despise manual labor. How few of them would be able to make a  telescope, or even a plainer instrument? Most of them are not capable  of even designing a scientific instrument, and when they have given a  vague suggestion to the instrument-maker they leave it with him to  invent the apparatus they need. Nay, they have raised the contempt of  manual labor to the height of a theory. \"The man of science,\" they say,  \"must discover the laws of nature, the civil engineer must apply them,  and the worker must execute in steel or wood, in iron or stone, the  patterns devised by the engineer. He must work with machines invented  for him, not by him. No matter if he does not understand them and cannot  improve them: the scientific man and the scientific engineer will take  care of the progress of science and industry.\"    It may be objected that nevertheless there is a class of men who belong  to none of the above three divisions. When young they have been manual  workers, and some of them continue to be; but, owing to some happy  circumstances, they have succeeded in acquiring some scientific  knowledge, and thus they have combined science with handicraft. Surely  there are such men; happily enough there is a nucleus of men who have  escaped the so-much-advocated specialization of labor, and it is  precisely to them that industry owes its chief recent inventions. But in  old Europe at least, they are the exceptions; they are the  irregulars--the Cossacks who have broken the ranks and pierced the  screens so carefully erected between the classes. And they are so few,  in comparison with the ever-growing requirements of industry--and of  science as well, as I am about to prove--that all over the world we hear  complaint about the scarcity of precisely such men.    What is the meaning, in fact, of the outcry for technical education  which has been raised at one and the same time in England, in France, in  Germany, in the States, and in Russia, if it does not express a general  dissatisfaction with the present division into scientists, scientific  engineers, and workers? Listen to those who know industry, and you will  see that the substance of their complaint is this: \"The worker whose  task has been specialized by the permanent division of labor has lost  the intellectual interest in his labor, and it is especially so in the  great industries: he has lost his inventive powers. Formerly, he  invented very much. Manual workers--not men of science nor trained  engineers--have invented, or brought to perfection, the prime motors and  all that mass of machinery which has revolutionized industry for the  last hundred years. But since the great factory has been enthroned, the  worker, depressed by the monotony of his work, invents no more. What can  a weaver invent who merely supervises four looms, without knowing  anything either about their complicated movements or how the machines  grew to be what they are? What can a man invent who is condemned for  life to bind together the ends of two threads with the greatest  celerity, and knows nothing beyond making a knot?    \"At the outset of modern industry, three generations of workers _have_  invented; now they cease to do so. As to the inventions of the  engineers, specially trained for devising machines, they are either  devoid of genius or not practical enough. Those \"nearly to nothings,\" of  which Sir Frederick Bramwell spoke once at Bath, are missing in their  inventions--those nothings which can be learned in the workshop only,  and which permitted a Murdoch and the Soho workers to make a practical  engine of Watt's schemes. None but he who knows the machine--not in its  drawings and models only, but in its breathing and throbbings--who  unconsciously thinks of it while standing by it, can really improve it.  Smeaton and Newcomen surely were excellent engineers; but in their  engines a boy had to open the steam valve at each stroke of the piston;  and it was one of those boys who once managed to connect the valve with  the remainder of the machine, so as to make it open automatically, while  he ran away to play with other boys. But in the modern machinery there  is no room left for naive improvements of that kind. Scientific  education on a wide scale has become necessary for further inventions,  and that education is refused to the workers. So that there is no issue  out of the difficulty unless scientific education and handicraft are  combined together--unless integration of knowledge takes the place of  the present divisions.\" Such is the real substance of the present  movement in favor of technical education. But, instead of bringing to  public consciousness the, perhaps, unconscious motives of the present  discontent, instead of widening the views of the discontented and  discussing the problem to its full extent, the mouth-pieces of the  movement do not mostly rise above the shopkeeper's view of "]]]
