But greater than any of these is the inclination of the orbit  of the tiny planet Eros, viz. nearly 11 deg.    The systems of satellites revolving around their respective planets  being, as we have already pointed out, mere miniature editions of the  solar system, the considerations so far detailed, which regulate the  behaviour of the planets in their relations to the sun, will of  necessity apply to the satellites very closely. In one respect, however,  a system of satellites differs materially from a system of planets. The  central body around which planets are in motion is self-luminous,  whereas the planetary body around which a satellite revolves is not.  True, planets shine, and shine very brightly too; as, for instance,  Venus and Jupiter. But they do not give forth any light of their own, as  the sun does; they merely reflect the sunlight which they receive from  him. Putting this one fact aside, the analogy between the planetary  system and a satellite system is remarkable. The satellites are  spherical in form, and differ markedly in size; they rotate, so far as  we know, upon their axes in varying times; they revolve around their  governing planets in orbits, not circular, but elliptic; and these  orbits, furthermore, do not of necessity lie in the same plane. Last of  all the satellites revolve around their primaries at rates which are  directly comparable with those at which the planets revolve around the  sun, the rule in fact holding good that the nearer a satellite is to its  primary the faster it revolves.      [3] As there seems to be much difference of opinion concerning the  diameters of Uranus and Neptune, it should here be mentioned that the  above figures are taken from Professor F.R. Moulton's _Introduction to  Astronomy_ (1906). They are there stated to be given on the authority of  \"Barnard's many measures at the Lick Observatory.\"          CHAPTER IV    CELESTIAL MECHANISM      As soon as we begin to inquire closely into the actual condition of the  various members of the solar system we are struck with a certain  distinction. We find that there are two quite different points of view  from which these bodies can be regarded. For instance, we may make our  estimates of them either as regards _volume_--that is to say, the mere  room which they take up; or as regards _mass_--that is to say, the  amount of matter which they contain.    Let us imagine two globes of equal volume; in other words, which take up  an equal amount of space. One of these globes, however, may be composed  of material much more tightly put together than in the other; or of  greater _density_, as the term goes. That globe is said to be the  greater of the two in mass. Were such a pair of globes to be weighed in  scales, one globe in each pan, we should see at once, by its weighing  down the other, which of the two was composed of the more tightly packed  materials; and we should, in astronomical parlance, say of this one that  it had the greater mass.    Volume being merely another word for size, the order of the members of  the solar system, with regard to their volumes, will be as follows,  beginning with the greatest:--the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,  Neptune, the Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury.    With regard to mass the same order strangely enough holds good. The  actual densities of the bodies in question are, however, very different.  The densest or closest packed body of all is the Earth, which is about  five and a half times as dense as if it were composed entirely of water.  Venus follows next, then Mars, and then Mercury. The remaining bodies,  on the other hand, are relatively loose in structure. Saturn is the  least dense of all, less so than water. The density of the Sun is a  little greater than that of water.    This method of estimating is, however, subject to a qualification. It  must be remembered that in speaking of the Sun, for instance, as being  only a little denser than water, we are merely treating the question  from the point of view of an average. Certain parts of it in fact will  be ever so much denser than water: those are the parts in the centre.  Other portions, for instance, the outside portions, will be very much  less dense. It will easily be understood that in all such bodies the  densest or most compressed portions are to be found towards the centre;  while the portions towards the exterior being less pressed upon, will be  less dense.    We now reach a very important point, the question of Gravitation.  _Gravitation_, or _gravity_, as it is often called, is the attractive  force which, for instance, causes objects to fall to the earth. Now it  seems rather strange that one should say that it is owing to a certain  force that things fall towards the earth. All things seem to us to fall  so of their own accord, as if it were quite natural, or rather most  unnatural if they did not. Why then require a \"force\" to make them fall?    The story goes that the great Sir Isaac Newton was set a-thinking on  this subject by seeing an apple fall from a tree to the earth. He then  carried the train of thought further; and, by studying the movements of  the moon, he reached the conclusion that a body even so far off as our  satellite would be drawn towards the earth in the same manner. This  being the case, one will naturally ask why the moon herself does not  fall in upon the earth. The answer is indeed found to be that the moon  is travelling round and round the earth at a certain rapid pace, and it  is this very same rapid pace which keeps her from falling in upon us.  Any one can test this simple fact for himself. If we tie a stone to the  end of a string, and keep whirling it round and round fast enough, there  will be a strong pull from the stone in an outward direction, and the  string will remain tight all the time that the stone is being whirled.  If, however, we gradually slacken the speed at which we are making the  stone whirl, a moment will come at length when the string will become  limp, and the stone will fall back towards our hand.    It seems, therefore, that there are two causes which maintain the stone  at a regular distance all the time it is being steadily whirled. One of  these is the continual pull inward towards our hand by means of the  string. The other is the continual pull away from us caused by the rate  at which the stone is travelling. When the rate of whirling is so  regulated that these pulls exactly balance each other, the stone travels  comfortably round and round, and shows no tendency either to fall back  upon our hand or to break the string and fly away into the air. It is  indeed precisely similar with regard to the moon. The continual pull of  the earth's gravitation takes the place of the string. If the moon were  to go round and round slower than it does, it would tend to fall in  towards the earth; if, on the other hand, it were to go faster, it would  tend to rush away into space.    The same kind of pull which the earth exerts upon the objects at its  surface, or upon its satellite, the moon, exists through space so far as  we know. Every particle of matter in the universe is found in fact to  attract every other particle. The moon, for instance, attracts the earth  also, but the controlling force is on the side of the much greater mass  of the earth. This force of gravity or attraction of gravitation, as it  is also called, is perfectly regular in its action. Its power depends  first of all exactly upon the mass of the body which exerts it. The  gravitational pull of the sun, for instance, reaches out to an enormous  distance, controlling perhaps, in their courses, unseen planets circling  far beyond the orbit of Neptune. Again, the strength with which the  force of gravity acts depends upon distance in a regularly diminishing  proportion. Thus, the nearer an object is to the earth, for instance,  the stronger is the gravitational pull which it gets from it; the  farther off it is, the weaker is this pull. If then the moon were to be  brought nearer to the earth, the gravitational pull of the latter would  become so much stronger that the moon's rate of motion would have also  to increase in due proportion to prevent her from being drawn into the  earth. Last of all, the point in a body from which the attraction of  gravitation acts, is not necessarily the centre of the body, but rather  what is known as its _centre of gravity_, that is to say, the balancing  point of all the matter which the body contains.    It should here be noted that the moon does not actually revolve around  the centre of gravity of the earth. What really happens is that both  orbs revolve around their _common_ centre of gravity, which is a point  within the body of the earth, and situated about three thousand miles  from its centre. In the same manner the planets and the sun revolve  around the centre of gravity of the solar system, which is a point  within the body of the sun.    The neatly poised movements of the planets around the sun, and of the  satellites around their respective planets, will therefore be readily  understood to result from a nice balance between gravitation and speed  of motion.    The mass of the earth is ascertained to be about eighty times that of  the moon. Our knowledge of the mass of a planet is learned from  comparing the revolutions of its satellite or satellites around it, with  those of the moon around the earth. We are thus enabled to deduce what  the mass of such a planet would be compared to the earth's mass; that is  to say, a study, for instance, of Jupiter's satellite system shows that  Jupiter must have a mass nearly three hundred and eighteen times that of  our earth. In the same manner we can argue out the mass of the sun from  the movements of the planets and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],[0,"Letters on an Elk Hunt (#5)"],[1,"  \"I don't have time,\" he answered. \"I came West eighteen years ago to  make a start and a home for Jennie and me, but I can't find time to go  back and get her. In the summer I have to hustle to make the hay and  grain, and I have to stay and feed the stock all the rest of the  time.\"    \"You write her once in a while, don't you?\" asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I wrote her two years ago come April; then I was so  busy I didn't go to town till I went for my year's supplies. I went to  the post office, and sure enough there was a letter for me,--been  waitin' for me for six months. You see the postmaster knows me and  never would send a letter back. I set down there right in the office  and answered it. I told her how it was, told her I was coming after  her soon as I could find time. You see, she refuses to come to me  'cause I am so far from the railroad, and she is afraid of Indians and  wild animals.\"    \"Have you got your answer?\" asked Elizabeth.    \"No,\" he said, \"I ain't had time yet to go, but I kind of wish  somebody would think to bring the mail. Not many people pass here,  only when the open season takes hunters to the mountains. When you  people come back will you stop and ask for the mail for me?\"    We promised.    In the purple and amber light of a new day we were about, and soon  were on the road. By nightfall we had bidden the desert a glad  farewell, and had camped on a large stream among trees. How glad we  were to see so much water and such big cottonwoods! Mr. and Mrs.  Burney were within a day's drive of home, so they left us. This camp  is at Newfork, and our party has four new members: a doctor, a  moving-picture man, and two geological fellows. They have gone on, but  we will join them soon.    Just across the creek from us is the cabin of a new settler. Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy and I slept together last night,--only we couldn't sleep  for the continual, whining cry of a sick baby at the cabin. So after a  while we rose and dressed and crossed over to see if we could be of  any help. We found a woefully distressed young couple. Their first  child, about a year old, was very sick. They didn't know what to do  for it; and she was afraid to stay alone while he went for help.    They were powerfully glad to see us, and the young father left at  once to get Grandma Mortimer, a neighborhood godsend such as most  Western communities have one of. We busied ourselves relieving the  young mother as much as we could. She wouldn't leave the baby and lie  down. The child is teething and had convulsions. We put it into a hot  bath and held the convulsions in check until Mrs. Mortimer came. She  bustled in and took hold in a way to insure confidence. She had not  been there long before she had both parents in bed, \"saving themselves  for to-morrow,\" and was gently rubbing the hot little body of the  baby. She kept giving it warm tea she had made of herbs, until soon  the threatening jerks were over, the peevish whining ceased, and the  child slept peacefully on Grandma's lap. I watched her, fascinated.  There was never a bit of faltering, no indecision; everything she did  seemed exactly what she ought to do.    \"How did you learn it all?\" I asked her. \"How can you know just what  to do, and then have the courage to do it? I should be afraid of  doing the wrong thing.\"    \"Why,\" she said, \"that is easy. Just do the very best you can and  trust God for the rest. After all, it is God who saves the baby, not  us and not our efforts; but we can help. He lets us do that. Lots of  times the good we do goes beyond any medicine. Never be afraid to  _help_ your best. I have been doing that for forty years and I am  going to keep it up till I die.\"    Then she told us story after story--told us how her different  ambitions had \"boosted\" her along, had made her swim when she just  wanted to float. \"I was married when I was sixteen, and of course, my  first ambition was to own a home for Dave. My man was poor. He had a  horse, and his folks gave him another. My father gave me a heifer, and  mother fitted me out with a bed. That was counted a pretty good start  then, but we would have married even if we hadn't had one thing. Being  young we were over-hopeful. We both took to work like a duck to  water. Some years it looked as if we were going to see every dream  come true. Another time and we would be poorer than at first. One year  the hail destroyed everything; another time the flood carried away all  we had.    \"When little Dave was eleven years old, he had learned to plough.  Every one of us was working to our limit that year. I ploughed and  hoed, both, and big Dave really hardly took time to sleep. You see,  his idea was that we must do better by our children than we had been  done by, and Fanny, our eldest, was thirteen. Big Dave thought all  girls married at sixteen because his mother did, and so did I; so that  spring he said, 'In just three years Fanny will be leaving us and we  _must_ do right by her. I wanted powerfully bad that _you_ should have  a blue silk wedding dress, mother, but of course it couldn't be had,  and you looked as pretty as a rose in your pink lawn. But I've always  wanted you to have a blue silk. As you can't have it, let us get it  for Fanny; and of course we must have everything else according.' And  so we worked mighty hard.    \"Little Dave begged to be allowed to plough. Every other boy in the  neighborhood did,--some of them younger than he,--but somehow I didn't  want him to. One of our neighbors had been sick a lot that year and  his crops were about ruined. It was laying-by time and we had finished  laying by our crops--all but about half a day's ploughing in the corn.  That morning at breakfast, big Dave said he would take the horses and  go over to Henry Boles's and plough that day to help out,--said he  could finish ours any time, and it didn't matter much if it didn't get  ploughed. He told the children to lay off that day and go fishing and  berrying. So he went to harness his team, and little Dave went to help  him. Fanny and I went to milk, and all the time I could hear little  Dave begging his father to let him finish the ploughing. His father  said he could if I said so.    \"I will never forget his eager little face as he began on me. He had a  heap of freckles; I remember noticing them that morning; he was  barefooted, and I remember that one toe was skinned. Big Dave was  lighting his pipe, and till to-day I remember how he looked as he held  the match to his pipe, drew a puff of smoke, and said, 'Say yes,  mother.' So I said yes, and little Dave ran to open the gate for his  father.    \"As big Dave rode through the gate, our boy caught him by the leg and  said, 'I just _love_ you, daddy.' Big Dave bent down and kissed him,  and said, 'You're a _man_, son.' How proud that made the little  fellow! Parents should praise their children more; the little things  work hard for a few words of praise, and many of them never get their  pay.    \"Well, the little fellow would have no help to harness his mule; so  Fanny and I went to the house, and Fanny said, 'We ought to cook an  extra good dinner to celebrate Davie's first ploughing. I'll go down  in the pasture and gather some blackberries if you will make a  cobbler.'    \"She was gone all morning. About ten o'clock, I took a pail of fresh  water down to the field. I knew Davie would be thirsty, and I was  uneasy about him, but he was all right. He pushed his ragged old hat  back and wiped the sweat from his brow just as his father would have  done. I petted him a little, but he was so mannish he didn't want me  to pet him any more. After he drank, he took up his lines again, and  said, 'Just watch me, mother; see how I can plough.' I told him that  we were going to have chicken and dumplings for dinner, and that he  must sit in his father's place and help us to berry-cobbler. As he had  only a few more rows to plough, I went back, telling myself how  foolish I had been to be afraid.    \"Twelve o'clock came, but not Davie. I sent Fanny to the spring for  the buttermilk and waited a while, thinking little Dave had not  finished as soon as he had expected. I went to the field. Little Dave  lay on his face in the furrow. I gathered him up in my arms; he was  yet alive; he put one weak little arm around my neck, and said, 'Oh,  mammy, I'm hurt. The mule kicked me in the stomach.'    \"I don't know how I got to the house with him; I stumbled over clods  and weeds, through the hot sunshine. I sank down on the porch in the  shade, with the precious little form clasped tightly to me. He smiled,  and tried to speak, but the blood gurgled up into his throat and my  little boy was gone.    \"I would have died of grief if I hadn't had to work so hard. Big Dave  got too warm at work that day, and when Fanny went for him and told  him about little Dave, he ran all the way home; he was crazy with  grief and forgot the horses. The trouble and the heat and the overwork  brought on a fever. I had no time for tears for three months, and by  that time my heart was hardened against my Maker. I got deeper in the  rut of work, but I had given up my ambition for a home of my own; all  I wanted to do was to work so hard that I could not think of the  little grave on which the leaves were falling. I wanted, too, to save  enough money to mark the precious spot, and then I wanted to leave.  But first one thing and then another took every dollar we made for  three years.    \"One morning big Dave looked so worn out and pale that I said, 'I am  going to get out of here; I am not going to stay here and bury _you_,  Dave. Sunrise to-morrow will see us on the road West. We have worked  for eighteen years as hard as we knew how, and have given up my boy  besides; and now we can't even afford to mark his grave decently. It  is time we left.'    \"Big Dave went back to bed, and I went out and sold what we had. It  was so little that it didn't take "]]]
