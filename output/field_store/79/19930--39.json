Mental exercises, such as completing stanzas or verses on receiving  a part of them; or supplying one, two or three lines when the remaining  lines are given indiscriminately from different verses, so as to make  the whole an entire verse with regard to its meaning; or arranging the  words of a verse written irregularly by separating the vowels from the  consonants, or leaving them out altogether; or putting into verse or  prose sentences represented by signs or symbols. There are many other  such exercises.    50. Composing poems.    51. Knowledge of dictionaries and vocabularies.    52. Knowledge of ways of changing and disguising the appearance of  persons.    53. Knowledge of the art of changing the appearance of things, such as  making cotton to appear as silk, coarse and common things to appear as  fine and good.    54. Various ways of gambling.    55. Art of obtaining possession of the property of others by means of  muntras or incantations.    56. Skill in youthful sports.    57. Knowledge of the rules of society, and of how to pay respects and  compliments to others.    58. Knowledge of the art of war, of arms, of armies, &c.    59. Knowledge of gymnastics.    60. Art of knowing the character of a man from his features.    61. Knowledge of scanning or constructing verses.    62. Arithmetical recreations.    63. Making artificial flowers.    64. Making figures and images in clay.    A public woman, endowed with a good disposition, beauty and other  winning qualities, and also versed in the above arts, obtains the name  of a Ganika, or public woman of high quality, and receives a seat of  honour in an assemblage of men. She is, moreover, always respected by  the king, and praised by learned men, and her favour being sought for by  all, she becomes an object of universal regard. The daughter of a king  too, as well as the daughter of a minister, being learned in the above  arts, can make their husbands favourable to them, even though these may  have thousands of other wives besides themselves. And in the same  manner, if a wife becomes separated from her husband, and falls into  distress, she can support herself easily, even in a foreign country, by  means of her knowledge of these arts. Even the bare knowledge of them  gives attractiveness to a woman, though the practice of them may be only  possible or otherwise according to the circumstances of each case. A man  who is versed in these arts, who is loquacious and acquainted with the  arts of gallantry, gains very soon the hearts of women, even though he  is only acquainted with them for a short time.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 11: The author wishes to prove that a great many things are  done by people from practice and custom, without their being acquainted  with the reason of things, or the laws on which they are based, and this  is perfectly true.]    [Footnote 12: The proviso of being married applies to all the teachers.]          CHAPTER IV.    THE LIFE OF A CITIZEN.[13]      Having thus acquired learning, a man, with the wealth that he may have  gained by gift, conquest, purchase, deposit,[14] or inheritance from his  ancestors, should become a householder, and pass the life of a citizen.  He should take a house in a city, or large village, or in the vicinity  of good men, or in a place which is the resort of many persons. This  abode should be situated near some water, and divided into different  compartments for different purposes. It should be surrounded by a  garden, and also contain two rooms, an outer and an inner one. The inner  room should be occupied by the females, while the outer room, balmy with  rich perfumes, should contain a bed, soft, agreeable to the sight  covered with a clean white cloth, low in the middle part, having  garlands and bunches of flowers[15] upon it, and a canopy above it, and  two pillows, one at the top, another at the bottom. There should be also  a sort of couch besides, and at the head of this a sort of stool, on  which should be placed the fragrant ointments for the night, as well as  flowers, pots containing collyrium and other fragrant substances, things  used for perfuming the mouth, and the bark of the common citron tree.  Near the couch, on the ground, there should be a pot for spitting, a box  containing ornaments, and also a lute hanging from a peg made of the  tooth of an elephant, a board for drawing, a pot containing perfume,  some books, and some garlands of the yellow amaranth flowers. Not far  from the couch, and on the ground, there should be a round seat, a toy  cart, and a board for playing with dice; outside the outer room  there should be cages of birds,[16] and a separate place for spinning,  carving, and such like diversions. In the garden there should be a  whirling swing and a common swing, as also a bower of creepers covered  with flowers, in which a raised parterre should be made for sitting.    Now the householder having got up in the morning and performed his  necessary duties,[17] should wash his teeth, apply a limited quantity of  ointments and perfumes to his body, put some ornaments on his person and  collyrium on his eyelids and below his eyes, colour his lips with  alacktaka,[18] and look at himself in the glass. Having then eaten betel  leaves, with other things that give fragrance to the mouth, he should  perform his usual business. He should bathe daily, anoint his body with  oil every other day, apply a lathering[19] substance to his body every  three days, get his head (including face) shaved every four days, and  the other parts of his body every five or ten days.[20] All these things  should be done without fail, and the sweat of the armpits should also be  removed. Meals should be taken in the forenoon, in the afternoon, and  again at night, according to Charayana. After breakfast, parrots and  other birds should be taught to speak, and the fighting of cocks,  quails, and rams should follow. A limited time should be devoted to  diversions with Pithamardas, Vitas, and Vidushakas,[21] and then should  be taken the midday sleep.[22] After this the householder, having put on  his clothes and ornaments, should, during the afternoon, converse with  his friends. In the evening there should be singing, and after that the  householder, along with his friend, should await in his room, previously  decorated and perfumed, the arrival of the woman that may be attached to  him, or he may send a female messenger for her, or go for her himself.  After her arrival at his house, he and his friend should welcome her,  and entertain her with a loving and agreeable conversation. Thus end the  duties of the day.    The following are the things to be done occasionally as diversions or  amusements.    1. Holding festivals[23] in honour of different Deities.    2. Social gatherings of both sexes.    3. Drinking parties.    4. Picnics.    5. Other social diversions.      _Festivals._    On some particular auspicious day, an assembly of citizens should be  convened in the temple of Saraswati.[24] There the skill of singers, and  of others who may have come recently to the town, should be tested, and  on the following day they should always be given some rewards. After  that they may either be retained or dismissed, according as their  performances are liked or not by the assembly. The members of the  assembly should act in concert, both in times of distress as well as in  times of prosperity, and it is also the duty of these citizens to show  hospitality to strangers who may have come to the assembly. What is said  above should be understood to apply to all the other festivals which may  be held in honour of the different Deities, according to the present  rules.      _Social Gatherings._    When men of the same age, disposition and talents, fond of the same  diversions and with the same degree of education, sit together in  company with public women,[25] or in an assembly of citizens, or at the  abode of one among themselves, and engage in agreeable discourse with  each other, such is called a sitting in company or a social gathering.  The subjects of discourse are to be the completion of verses half  composed by others, and the testing the knowledge of one another in the  various arts. The women who may be the most beautiful, who may like the  same things that the men like, and who may have power to attract the  minds of others, are here done homage to.      _Drinking Parties._    Men and women should drink in one another's houses. And here the men  should cause the public women to drink, and should then drink  themselves, liquors such as the Madhu, Aireya, Sara, and Asawa, which  are of bitter and sour taste; also drinks concocted from the barks of  various trees, wild fruits and leaves.      _Going to Gardens or Picnics._    In the forenoon, men, having dressed themselves should go to gardens on  horseback, accompanied by public women and followed by servants. And  having done there all the duties of the day, and passed the time in  various agreeable diversions, such as the fighting of quails, cocks and  rams, and other spectacles, they should return home in the afternoon in  the same manner, bringing with them bunches of flowers, &c.    The same also applies to bathing in summer in water from which wicked or  dangerous animals have previously been taken out, and which has been  built in on all sides.      _Other Social Diversions._    Spending nights playing with dice. Going out on moonlight nights.  Keeping the festive day in honour of spring. Plucking the sprouts and  fruits of the mangoe trees. Eating the fibres of lotuses. Eating the  tender ears of corn. Picnicing in the forests when the trees get their  new foliage. The Udakakashvedika or sporting in the water. Decorating  each other with the flowers of some trees. Pelting each other with the  flowers of the Kadamba tree, and many other sports which may either be  known to the whole country, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2785"],[0,"The Elusive Pimpernel (#5)"],[1," again  of Marguerite Blakeney, and the terrible alternative he had put before  HER less than a year ago.    Well! he was prepared to take the risk. He would not fail again. He was  going to England under more favourable conditions this time. He knew who  the man was, whom he was bidden to lure to France and to death.    And he returned Robespierre's threatening gaze boldly and unflinchingly;  then he prepared to go. He took up his hat and cloak, opened the door  and peered for a moment into the dark corridor, wherein, in the far  distance, the steps of a solitary sentinel could be faintly heard: he  put on his hat, turned to look once more into the room where Robespierre  stood quietly watching him, and went his way.          Chapter IV: The Richmond Gala        It was perhaps the most brilliant September ever known in England, where  the last days of dying summer are nearly always golden and beautiful.    Strange that in this country, where that same season is so peculiarly  radiant with a glory all its own, there should be no special expression  in the language with which to accurately name it.    So we needs must call it \"fin d'ete\": the ending of the summer; not the  absolute end, nor yet the ultimate departure, but the tender lingering  of a friend obliged to leave us anon, yet who fain would steal a day  here and there, a week or so in which to stay with us: who would make  that last pathetic farewell of his endure a little while longer still,  and brings forth in gorgeous array for our final gaze all that he has  which is most luxuriant, most desirable, most worthy of regret.    And in this year of grace 1793, departing summer had lavished the  treasures of her palette upon woodland and river banks; had tinged the  once crude green of larch and elm with a tender hue of gold, had brushed  the oaks with tones of warm russet, and put patches of sienna and  crimson on the beech.    In the gardens the roses were still in bloom, not the delicate blush  or lemon ones of June, nor yet the pale Banksias and climbers, but the  full-blooded red roses of late summer, and deep-coloured apricot ones,  with crinkled outside leaves faintly kissed by the frosty dew. In  sheltered spots the purple clematis still lingered, whilst the dahlias,  brilliant of hue, seemed overbearing in their gorgeous insolence,  flaunting their crudely colored petals against sober backgrounds of  mellow leaves, or the dull, mossy tones of ancient, encircling walls.    The Gala had always been held about the end of September. The weather,  on the riverside, was most dependable then, and there was always  sufficient sunshine as an excuse for bringing out Madam's last new  muslin gown, or her pale-coloured quilted petticoat. Then the ground  was dry and hard, good alike for walking and for setting up tents and  booths. And of these there was of a truth a most goodly array this year:  mountebanks and jugglers from every corner of the world, so it seemed,  for there was a man with a face as black as my lord's tricorne, and  another with such flat yellow cheeks as made one think of batter  pudding, and spring aconite, of eggs and other very yellow things.    There was a tent wherein dogs--all sorts of dogs, big, little, black,  white or tan--did things which no Christian with respect for his own  backbone would have dared to perform, and another where a weird-faced  old man made bean-stalks and walking sticks, coins of the realm and lace  kerchiefs vanish into thin air.    And as it was nice and hot one could sit out upon the green and listen  to the strains of the band, which discoursed sweet music, and watch the  young people tread a measure on the sward.    The quality had not yet arrived: for humbler folk had partaken of very  early dinner so as to get plenty of fun, and long hours of delight for  the sixpenny toll demanded at the gates.    There was so much to see and so much to do: games of bowls on the  green, and a beautiful Aunt Sally, there was a skittle alley, and two  merry-go-rounds: there were performing monkeys and dancing bears, a  woman so fat that three men with arms outstretched could not get round  her, and a man so thin that he could put a lady's bracelet round his  neck and her garter around his waist.    There were some funny little dwarfs with pinched faces and a knowing  manner, and a giant come all the way from Russia--so 'twas said.    The mechanical toys too were a great attraction. You dropped a penny  into a little slit in a box and a doll would begin to dance and play the  fiddle: and there was the Magic Mill, where for another modest copper  a row of tiny figures, wrinkled and old and dressed in the shabbiest of  rags, marched in weary procession up a flight of steps into the Mill,  only to emerge again the next moment at a further door of this wonderful  building looking young and gay, dressed in gorgeous finery and tripping  a dance measure as they descended some steps and were finally lost to  view.    But what was most wonderful of all and collected the goodliest crowd of  gazers and the largest amount of coins, was a miniature representation  of what was going on in France even at this very moment.    And you could not help but be convinced of the truth of it all, so  cleverly was it done. There was a background of houses and a very  red-looking sky. \"Too red!\" some people said, but were immediately  quashed by the dictum of the wise, that the sky represented a sunset, as  anyone who looked could see. Then there were a number of little figures,  no taller than your hand, but with little wooden faces and arms and  legs, just beautifully made little dolls, and these were dressed in  kirtles and breeches--all rags mostly--and little coats and wooden  shoes. They were massed together in groups with their arms all turned  upwards.    And in the center of this little stage on an elevated platform there  were miniature wooden posts close together, and with a long flat board  at right angles at the foot of the posts, and all painted a bright red.  At the further end of the boards was a miniature basket, and between the  two posts, at the top, was a miniature knife which ran up and down in a  groove and was drawn by a miniature pulley. Folk who knew said that this  was a model of a guillotine.    And lo and behold! when you dropped a penny into a slot just below the  wooden stage, the crowd of little figures started waving their arms up  and down, and another little doll would ascend the elevated platform and  lie down on the red board at the foot of the wooden posts. Then a figure  dressed in brilliant scarlet put out an arm presumably to touch the  pulley, and the tiny knife would rattle down on to the poor little  reclining doll's neck, and its head would roll off into the basket  beyond.    Then there was a loud whirr of wheels, a buzz of internal mechanism, and  all the little figures would stop dead with arms outstretched, whilst  the beheaded doll rolled off the board and was lost to view, no doubt  preparatory to going through the same gruesome pantomime again.    It was very thrilling, and very terrible: a certain air of hushed awe  reigned in the booth where this mechanical wonder was displayed.    The booth itself stood in a secluded portion of the grounds, far from  the toll gates, and the band stand and the noise of the merry-go-round,  and there were great texts, written in red letters on a black ground,  pinned all along the walls.    \"Please spare a copper for the starving poor of Paris.\"    A lady, dressed in grey quilted petticoat and pretty grey and black  striped paniers, could be seen walking in the booth from time to time,  then disappearing through a partition beyond. She would emerge again  presently carrying an embroidered reticule, and would wander round among  the crowd, holding out the bag by its chain, and repeating in tones  of somewhat monotonous appeal: \"For the starving poor of Paris, if you  please!\"    She had fine, dark eyes, rather narrow and tending upwards at the outer  corners, which gave her face a not altogether pleasant expression.  Still, they were fine eyes, and when she went round soliciting alms,  most of the men put a hand into their breeches pocket and dropped a coin  into her embroidered reticule.    She said the word \"poor\" in rather a funny way, rolling the \"r\" at the  end, and she also said \"please\" as if it were spelt with a long line of  \"e's,\" and so it was concluded that she was French and was begging for  her poorer sisters. At stated intervals during the day, the mechanical  toy was rolled into a corner, and the lady in grey stood up on a  platform and sang queer little songs, the words of which nobody could  understand.    \"Il etait une bergere et ron et petit pataplon....\"    But it all left an impression of sadness and of suppressed awe upon the  minds and susceptibilities of the worthy Richmond yokels come with  their wives or sweethearts to enjoy the fun of the fair, and gladly  did everyone emerge out of that melancholy booth into the sunshine, the  brightness and the noise.    \"Lud! but she do give me the creeps,\" said Mistress Polly, the pretty  barmaid from the Bell Inn, down by the river. \"And I must say that I  don't see why we English folk should send our hard-earned pennies to  those murdering ruffians over the water. Bein' starving so to speak,  don't make a murderer a better man if he goes on murdering,\" she added  with undisputable if ungrammatical logic. \"Come, let's look at something  more cheerful now.\"    And without waiting for anyone else's assent, she turned towards the  more lively portion of the grounds, closely followed by a ruddy-faced,  somewhat sheepish-looking youth, who very obviously was her attendant  swain.    It was getting on for three o-clock now, and the quality were beginning  to arrive. Lord Anthony Dewhurst was already there, chucking every  pretty girl under the chin, to the annoyance of her beau.
