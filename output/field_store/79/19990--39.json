I thought it was dawn and set out for  Alimos.(1) I had hardly got beyond the walls, when a footpad struck me  in the back with his bludgeon; down I went and wanted to shout, but he  had already made off with my mantle.    f(1) Noted as the birthplace of Thucydides, a deme of Attica of the  tribe of Leontis. Demosthenes tells us it was thirty-five stadia from  Athens.    PISTHETAERUS Formerly also the kite was ruler and king over the Greeks.    EPOPS The Greeks?    PISTHETAERUS And when he was king, 'twas he who first taught them to  fall on their knees before the kites.(1)    f(1) The appearance of the kite in Greece betokened the return of  springtime; it was therefore worshipped as a symbol of that season.    EUELPIDES By Zeus! 'tis what I did myself one day on seeing a kite; but  at the moment I was on my knees, and leaning backwards(1) with mouth  agape, I bolted an obolus and was forced to carry my bag home empty.(2)    f(1) To look at the kite, who no doubt was flying high in the sky.    f(2) As already shown, the Athenians were addicted to carrying small  coins in their mouths.--This obolus was for the purpose of buying flour  to fill the bag he was carrying    PISTHETAERUS The cuckoo was king of Egypt and of the whole of Phoenicia.  When he called out \"cuckoo,\" all the Phoenicians hurried to the fields  to reap their wheat and their barley.(1)    f(1) In Phoenicia and Egypt the cuckoo makes its appearance about  harvest-time.    EUELPIDES Hence no doubt the proverb, \"Cuckoo! cuckoo! go to the fields,  ye circumcised.\"(1)    f(1) This was an Egyptian proverb, meaning, 'When the cuckoo sings we  go harvesting.' Both the Phoenicians and the Egyptians practised  circumcision.    PISTHETAERUS So powerful were the birds that the kings of Grecian  cities, Agamemnon, Menelaus, for instance, carried a bird on the tip of  their sceptres, who had his share of all presents.(1)    f(1) The staff, called a sceptre, generally terminated in a piece of  carved work, representing a flower, a fruit, and most often a bird.    EUELPIDES That I didn't know and was much astonished when I saw Priam  come upon the stage in the tragedies with a bird, which kept watching  Lysicrates(1) to see if he got any present.    f(1) A general accused of treachery. The bird watches Lysicrates,  because, according to Pisthetaerus, he had a right to a share of the  presents.    PISTHETAERUS But the strongest proof of all is, that Zeus, who now  reigns, is represented as standing with an eagle on his head as a symbol  of his royalty;(1) his daughter has an owl, and Phoebus, as his servant,  has a hawk.    f(1) It is thus that Phidias represents his Olympian Zeus.    EUELPIDES By Demeter, 'tis well spoken. But what are all these birds  doing in heaven?    PISTHETAERUS When anyone sacrifices and, according to the rite, offers  the entrails to the gods, these birds take their share before Zeus.  Formerly men always swore by the birds and never by the gods; even now  Lampon(1) swears by the goose, when he wants to lie....Thus 'tis clear  that you were great and sacred, but now you are looked upon as slaves,  as fools, as Helots; stones are thrown at you as at raving madmen, even  in holy places. A crowd of bird-catchers sets snares, traps, limed-twigs  and nets of all sorts for you; you are caught, you are sold in heaps  and the buyers finger you over to be certain you are fat. Again, if  they would but serve you up simply roasted; but they rasp cheese into a  mixture of oil, vinegar and laserwort, to which another sweet and greasy  sauce is added, and the whole is poured scalding hot over your back, for  all the world as if you were diseased meat.    f(1) One of the diviners sent to Sybaris (in Magna Graecia, S. Italy)  with the Athenian colonists, who rebuilt the town under the new name of  Thurium.    CHORUS Man, your words have made my heart bleed; I have groaned over the  treachery of our fathers, who knew not how to transmit to us the high  rank they held from their forefathers. But 'tis a benevolent Genius, a  happy Fate, that sends you to us; you shall be our deliverer and I  place the destiny of my little ones and my own in your hands with every  confidence. But hasten to tell me what must be done; we should not  be worthy to live, if we did not seek to regain our royalty by every  possible means.    PISTHETAERUS First I advise that the birds gather together in one city  and that they build a wall of great bricks, like that at Babylon, round  the plains of the air and the whole region of space that divides earth  from heaven.    EPOPS Oh, Cebriones! oh, Porphyrion!(1) what a terribly strong place!    f(1) As if he were saying, \"Oh, gods!\" Like Lampon, he swears by the  birds, instead of swearing by the gods.--The names of these birds are  those of two of the Titans.    PISTHETAERUS Th(en), this being well done and completed, you demand back  the empire from Zeus; if he will not agree, if he refuses and does not  at once confess himself beaten, you declare a sacred war against him and  forbid the gods henceforward to pass through your country with lust, as  hitherto, for the purpose of fondling their Alcmenas, their Alopes, or  their Semeles!(1) if they try to pass through, you infibulate them with  rings so that they can work no longer. You send another messenger to  mankind, who will proclaim to them that the birds are kings, that for  the future they must first of all sacrifice to them, and only afterwards  to the gods; that it is fitting to appoint to each deity the bird  that has most in common with it. For instance, are they sacrificing to  Aphrodite, let them at the same time offer barley to the coot; are they  immolating a sheep to Posidon, let them consecrate wheat in honour of  the duck;(2) is a steer being offered to Heracles, let honey-cakes be  dedicated to the gull;(3) is a goat being slain for King Zeus, there is  a King-Bird, the wren,(4) to whom the sacrifice of a male gnat is due  before Zeus himself even.    f(1) Alcmena, wife of Amphitryon, King of Thebes and mother of  Heracles.--Semele, the daughter of Cadmus and Hermione and mother of  Bacchus; both seduced by Zeus.--Alope, daughter of Cercyon, a robber,  who reigned at Eleusis and was conquered by Perseus. Alope was honoured  with Posidon's caresses; by him she had a son named Hippothous, at first  brought up by shepherds but who afterwards was restored to the throne of  his grandfather by Theseus.    f(2) Because water is the duck's domain, as it is that of Posidon.    f(3) Because the gull, like Heracles, is voracious.    f(4) The Germans still call it 'Zaunkonig' and the French 'roitelet,'  both names thus containing the idea of 'king.'    EUELPIDES This notion of an immolated gnat delights me! And now let the  great Zeus thunder!    EPOPS But how will mankind recognize us as gods and not as jays? Us, who  have wings and fly?    PISTHETAERUS You talk rubbish! Hermes is a god and has wings and flies,  and so do many other gods. First of all, Victory flies with golden  wings, Eros is undoubtedly winged too, and Iris is compared by Homer to  a timorous dove.(1) If men in their blindness do not recognize you as  gods and continue to worship the dwellers in Olympus, then a cloud of  sparrows greedy for corn must descend upon their fields and eat up all  their seeds; we shall see then if Demeter will mete them out any wheat.      f(1) The scholiast draws our attention to the fact that Homer says this  of Here and not of Iris (Iliad, V, 778); it is only another proof that  the text of Homer has reached us in a corrupted form, or it may be that  Aristophanes was liable, like other people, to occasional mistakes of  quotation.    EUELPIDES By Zeus, she'll take good care she does not, and you will see  her inventing a thousand excuses.    PISTHETAERUS The crows too will prove your divinity to them by pecking  out the eyes of their flocks and of their draught-oxen; and then  let Apollo cure them, since he is a physician and is paid for the  purpose.(1)      f(1) In sacrifices.    EUELPIDES Oh! don't do that! Wait first until I have sold my two young  bullocks.    PISTHETAERUS If on the other hand they recognize that you are God, the  principle of life, that you are Earth, Saturn, Posidon, they shall be  loaded with benefits.    EPOPS Name me one of these then.    PISTHETAERUS Firstly, the locusts shall not eat up their vine-blossoms;  a legion of owls and kestrels will devour them. Moreover, the gnats and  the gall-bugs shall no longer ravage the figs; a flock of thrushes shall  swallow the whole host down to the very last.    EPOPS And how shall we give wealth to mankind? This is their strongest  passion.    PISTHETAERUS When they consult the omens, you will point them to the  richest mines, you will reveal the paying ventures to the diviner, and  not another shipwreck will happen or sailor perish.    EPOPS No more shall perish? How is that?    PISTHETAERUS When the auguries are examined before starting on a voyage,  some bird will not fail to say, \"Don't start! there will be a storm,\" or  else, \"Go! you will make a most profitable venture.\"    EUELPIDES I shall buy a trading-vessel and go to sea, I will not stay  with you.    PISTHETAERUS You will discover treasures to them, which were buried in  former times, for you know them. Do not all men say, \"None knows where  my treasure lies, unless perchance it be some bird.\"(1)      f(1) An Athenian proverb.    EUELPIDES I shall sell my boat and buy a spade to unearth the vessels.    EPOPS And how are we to give them health, which belongs to the gods?    PISTHETAERUS If they are happy, is not that the chief thing towards  health? The miserable man is never well.    EPOPS Old Age also dwells in Olympus. How will they get at it? Must they  die in early youth?    PISTHETAERUS "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30181"],[0,"Fungi: Their Nature and Uses (#5)"],[1," with  gonidia. Mr. Thwaites was the first to point out[R] the relation of  the gonidia in the different sections of lichens to different types of  supposed algae. The question cannot be settled by mere _a priori_  notions. It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that in _Chionyphe Carteri_  the threads grow over the cysts exactly as the hypha of lichens is  represented as growing over the gonidia.    Recently, Dr. Thwaites has communicated his views on one phase of this  controversy,[S] which will serve to illustrate the question as seen  from the mycological side. As is well known, this writer has had  considerable experience in the study of the anatomy and physiology of  all the lower cryptogamia, and any suggestion of his on such a subject  will at least commend itself to a patient consideration.    \"According to our experience,\" he writes, \"I think parasitic fungi  invariably produce a sad effect upon the tissues they fix themselves  upon or in. These tissues become pale in colour, and in every respect  sickly in appearance. But who has ever seen the gonidia of lichens the  worse for having the 'hypha' growing amongst them? These gonidia are  always in the plumpest state, and with the freshest, healthiest colour  possible. Cannot it enter into the heads of these most patient and  excellent observers, that a cryptogamic plant may have two kinds of  tissue growing side by side, without the necessity of one being  parasitic upon the other, just as one of the higher plants may have  half a dozen kinds of tissue making up its organization? The  beautifully symmetrical growth of the same lichens has seemed to me a  sufficient argument against one portion being parasitic upon another,  but when we see all harmony and robust health, the idea that one  portion is subsisting parasitically upon another appears to me to be a  perfect absurdity.\"    It appears to us that a great deal of confusion and a large number of  errors which creep into our modern generalizations and hypotheses, may  be traced to the acceptance of analogies for identities. How many  cases of mistaken identity has the improvement of microscopes revealed  during the past quarter of a century. This should at least serve as a  caution for the future.    Apart, however, from the \"gonidia,\" whatever they may be, is the  remainder of the lichen a genuine fungus? Nylander writes, \"The  anatomical filamentose elements of lichens are distinguished by  various characters from the hyphae of fungi. They are firmer, elastic,  and at once present themselves in the texture of lichens. On the other  hand, the hyphae of fungi are very soft, they possess a thin wall, and  are not at all gelatinous, while they are immediately dissolved by the  application of hydrate of potash, &c.\"[T]    Our own experience is somewhat to the effect, that there are some few  lichens which are doubtful as to whether they are fungi or lichens,  but, in by far the majority of cases, there is not the slightest  difficulty in determining, from the peculiar firmness and elasticity  of the tissues, minute peculiarities which the practised hand can  detect rather than describe, and even the general character of the  fruit that they differ materially from, though closely allied to  fungi. We have only experience to guide us in these matters, but that  is something, and we have no experience in fungi of anything like a  _Cladonia_, however much it may resemble a _Torrubia_ or _Clavaria_.  We have _Pezizae_ with a subiculum in the section _Tapesia_, but the  veriest tyro would not confound them with species of _Parmelia_. It is  true that a great number of lichens, at first sight, and casually,  resemble species of the _Hysteriacei_, but it is no less strange than  true, that lichenologists and mycologists know their own sufficiently  not to commit depredations on each other.    Contributions are daily being made to this controversy, and already  the principal arguments on both sides have appeared in an English  dress,[U] hence it will be unnecessary to repeat those which are  modifications only of the views already stated, our own conclusions  being capable of a very brief summary: that lichens and fungi are  closely related the one to the other, but that they are not identical;  that the \"gonidia\" of lichens are part of the lichen-organization, and  consequently are not algae, or any introduced bodies; that there is no  parasitism; and that the lichen thallus, exclusive of gonidia, is  wholly unknown amongst fungi.    The Rev. J. M. Crombie has therefore our sympathies in the remark with  which his summary of the gonidia controversy closes, in which he  characterizes it as a \"sensational romance of lichenology,\" of the  \"unnatural union between a captive algal damsel and a tyrant fungal  master.\"       [A] De Bary, \"Des Myxomycetes,\" in \"Ann. des Sci.

[H] Gray, \"Notices of Insects which form the Basis of Fungoid         Parasites.\"       [I] On the relation or connection between fungi and lichens, H. C.         Sorby has some pertinent remarks in his communication to the         Royal Society on \"Comparative Vegetable Chromatology\"         (Proceedings Royal Society, vol. xxi. 1873, p. 479), as one         result of his spectroscopic examinations. He says, \"Such being         the relations between the organs of reproduction and the         foliage, it is to some extent possible to understand the         connection between parasitic plants like fungi, which do not         derive their support from the constructive energy of their         fronds, and those which are self-supporting and possess true         fronds. In the highest classes of plants the flowers are         connected with the leaves, more especially by means of         xanthophyll and yellow xanthophyll, whereas in the case of         lichens the apothecia contain very little, if any, of those         substances, but a large amount of the lichenoxanthines so         characteristic of the class. Looking upon fungi from this         chromatological point of view, they bear something like the         same relation to lichens that the petals of a leafless         parasitic plant would bear to the foliage of one of normal         character--that is to say, they are, as it were, the coloured         organs of reproduction of parasitic plants of a type closely         approaching that of lichens, which, of course, is in very         close, if not in absolute agreement with the conclusions drawn         by botanists from entirely different data.\"       [J] Schwendener, \"Untersuchungen ueber den Flechtenthallus.\"       [K] Crombie (J.

Without some knowledge of the structure of fungi, it is scarcely  possible to comprehend the principles of classification, or to  appreciate the curious phenomena of polymorphism. Yet there is so  great a variety in the structure of the different groups, that this  subject cannot be compressed within a few paragraphs, neither do we  think that this would be desired if practicable, seeing that the  anatomy and physiology of plants is, in itself, sufficiently important  and interesting to warrant a rather extended and explicit survey. In  order to impart as much practical utility as possible to this chapter,  it seems advisable to treat some of the most important and typical  orders and suborders separately, giving prominence to the features  which are chiefly characteristic of those sections, following the  order of systematists as much as possible, whilst endeavouring to  render each section independent to a considerable extent, and complete  in itself. Some groups naturally present more noteworthy features than  others, and will consequently seem to receive more than their  proportional share of attention, but this seeming inequality could  scarcely have been avoided, inasmuch as hitherto some groups have been  more closely investigated than others, are more intimately associated  with other questions, or are more readily and satisfactorily examined  under different aspects of their life-history.
