In the present instance only two leaves are set  in each cluster; and the architect has been determined that the  naturalism should be perfect. For he was no common man who designed that  cathedral of Dunblane. I know not anything so perfect in its simplicity,  and so beautiful, as far as it reaches, in all the Gothic with which I  am acquainted. And just in proportion to his power of mind, that man was  content to work under Nature's teaching; and instead of putting a merely  formal dogtooth, as everybody else did at the time, he went down to the  woody bank of the sweet river beneath the rocks on which he was  building, and he took up a few of the fallen leaves that lay by it, and  he set them in his arch, side by side, forever. And, look--that he might  show you he had done this,--he has made them all of different sizes,  just as they lay; and that you might not by any chance miss noticing the  variety, he has put a great broad one at the top, and then a little one  turned the wrong way, next to it, so that you must be blind indeed if  you do not understand his meaning. And the healthy change and  playfulness of this just does in the stone-work what it does on the tree  boughs, and is a perpetual refreshment and invigoration; so that,  however long you gaze at this simple ornament--and none can be simpler,  a village mason could carve it all round the window in a few hours--you  are never weary of it, it seems always new.    15. It is true that oval windows of this form are comparatively rare in  Gothic work, but, as you well know, circular or wheel windows are used  constantly, and in most traceries the apertures are curved and pointed  as much at the bottom as the top. So that I believe you will now allow  me to proceed upon the assumption, that the pointed arch is indeed the  best form into which the head either of door or window can be thrown,  considered as a means of sustaining weight above it. How these pointed  arches ought to be grouped and decorated, I shall endeavor to show you  in my next lecture. Meantime I must beg of you to consider farther some  of the general points connected with the structure of the roof.    16. I am sure that all of you must readily acknowledge the charm which  is imparted to any landscape by the presence of cottages; and you must  over and over again have paused at the wicket gate of some cottage  garden, delighted by the simple beauty of the honeysuckle porch and  latticed window. Has it ever occurred to you to ask the question, what  effect the cottage would have upon your feelings if it had _no roof_? no  visible roof, I mean;--if instead of the thatched slope, in which the  little upper windows are buried deep, as in a nest of straw--or the  rough shelter of its mountain shales--or warm coloring of russet  tiles--there were nothing but a flat leaden top to it, making it look  like a large packing-case with windows in it? I don't think the rarity  of such a sight would make you feel it to be beautiful; on the contrary,  if you think over the matter, you will find that you actually do owe,  and ought to owe, a great part of your pleasure in all cottage scenery,  and in all the inexhaustible imagery of literature which is founded upon  it, to the conspicuousness of the cottage roof--to the subordination of  the cottage itself to its covering, which leaves, in nine cases out of  ten, really more roof than anything else. It is, indeed, not so much the  whitewashed walls--nor the flowery garden--nor the rude fragments of  stones set for steps at the door--nor any other picturesqueness of the  building which interest you, so much as the gray bank of its heavy  eaves, deep-cushioned with green moss and golden stone-crop. And there  is a profound, yet evident, reason for this feeling. The very soul of  the cottage--the essence and meaning of it--are in its roof; it is that,  mainly, wherein consists its shelter; that, wherein it differs most  completely from a cleft in rocks or bower in woods. It is in its thick  impenetrable coverlet of close thatch that its whole heart and  hospitality are concentrated. Consider the difference, in sound, of the  expressions \"beneath my roof\" and \"within my walls,\"--consider whether  you would be best sheltered, in a shed, with a stout roof sustained on  corner posts, or in an inclosure of four walls without a roof at  all,--and you will quickly see how important a part of the cottage the  roof must always be to the mind as well as to the eye, and how, from  seeing it, the greatest part of our pleasure must continually arise.    17. Now, do you suppose that which is so all-important in a cottage, can  be of small importance in your own dwelling-house? Do you think that by  any splendor of architecture--any height of stories--you can atone to  the mind for the loss of the aspect of the roof? It is vain to say you  take the roof for granted. You may as well say you take a man's kindness  for granted, though he neither looks nor speaks kindly. You may know him  to be kind in reality, but you will not like him so well as if he spoke  and looked kindly also. And whatever external splendor you may give your  houses, you will always feel there is something wanting, unless you see  their roofs plainly. And this especially in the north. In southern  architecture the roof is of far less importance; but here the soul of  domestic building is in the largeness and conspicuousness of the  protection against the ponderous snow and driving sleet. You may make  the facade of the square pile, if the roof be not seen, as handsome as  you please,--you may cover it with decoration,--but there will always be  a heartlessness about it, which you will not know how to conquer; above  all, a perpetual difficulty in finishing the wall at top, which will  require all kinds of strange inventions in parapets and pinnacles for  its decoration, and yet will never look right.    Now, I need not tell you that, as it is desirable, for the sake of the  effect upon the mind, that the roof should be visible, so the best and  most natural form of roof in the north is that which will render it  _most_ visible, namely, the steep gable: the best and most natural, I  say, because this form not only throws off snow and rain most  completely, and dries fastest, but obtains the greatest interior space  within walls of a given height, removes the heat of the sun most  effectually from the upper rooms, and affords most space for  ventilation.    18. You have then, observed, two great principles, as far as northern  architecture is concerned; first, that the pointed arch is to be the  means by which the weight of the wall or roof is to be sustained;  secondly, that the steep gable is the form most proper for the roof  itself. And now observe this most interesting fact, that all the  loveliest Gothic architecture in the world is based on the group of  lines composed of the pointed arch and the gable. If you look at the  beautiful apse of Amiens Cathedral--a work justly celebrated over all  Europe--you will find it formed merely of a series of windows surmounted  by pure gables of open work. If you look at the transept porches of  Rouen, or at the great and celebrated porch of the Cathedral of Rheims,  or that of Strasbourg, Bayeux, Amiens, or Peterborough, still you will  see that these lovely compositions are nothing more than richly  decorated forms of gable over pointed arch. But more than this, you must  be all well aware how fond our best architectural artists are of the  street effects of foreign cities; and even those now present who have  not personally visited any of the continental towns must remember, I  should think, some of the many interesting drawings by Mr. Prout, Mr.  Nash, and other excellent draughtsmen, which have for many years adorned  our exhibitions. Now, the principal charm of all those continental  street effects is dependent on the houses having high-pitched gable  roofs. In the Netherlands, and Northern France, where the material for  building is brick or stone, the fronts of the stone gables are raised  above the roofs, and you have magnificent and grotesque ranges of steps  or curves decorated with various ornaments, succeeding one another in  endless perspective along the streets of Antwerp, Ghent, or Brussels. In  Picardy and Normandy, again, and many towns of Germany, where the  material for building is principally wood, the roof is made to project  over the gables, fringed with a beautifully carved cornice, and casting  a broad shadow down the house front. This is principally seen at  Abbeville, Rouen, Lisieux, and others of the older towns of France. But,  in all cases, the effect of the whole street depends on the prominence  of the gables; not only of the fronts towards the streets, but of the  sides also, set with small garret or dormer windows, each of the most  fantastic and beautiful form, and crowned with a little spire or  pinnacle. Wherever there is a little winding stair, or projecting bow  window, or any other irregularity of form, the steep ridges shoot into  turrets and small spires, as in _fig._ 8,[6] each in its turn crowned by  a fantastic ornament, covered with curiously shaped slates or shingles,  or crested with long fringes of rich ironwork, so that, seen from above  and from a distance, the intricate grouping of the roofs of a French  city is no less interesting than its actual streets; and in the streets  themselves, the masses of broad shadow which the roofs form against the  sky, are a most important background to the bright and sculptured  surfaces of the walls.    [Footnote 6: This figure is copied from Prout.]    19. Finally, I need not remind you of the effect upon the northern mind  which has always been produced by the heaven-pointing spire, nor of the  theory which has been founded upon it of the general meaning of Gothic  architecture as expressive of religious aspiration.

As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled          Once, twice and again!       And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back       To carry the word to the waiting pack,       And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track          Once, twice and again!         As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled          Once, twice and again!       Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!         Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark!       Tongue--give tongue to it!  Hark!  O hark!          Once, twice and again!          Kaa's Hunting         His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the          Buffalo's pride.       Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the          gloss of his hide.       If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed          Sambhur can gore;       Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons          before.       Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister          and Brother,       For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is          their mother.       \"There is none like to me!\" says the Cub in the pride of his          earliest kill;       But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small.  Let him          think and be still.                                   Maxims of Baloo      All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of  the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It  was in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The  big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil,  for the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle  as applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can  repeat the Hunting Verse--\"Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in  the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white  teeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the  Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.\" But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to  learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther  would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting  on, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the  day's lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could  swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of  the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch  from a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came  upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the  Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the  water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them. None of  the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at  an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers' Hunting Call,  which must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the  Jungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, \"Give  me leave to hunt here because I am hungry.\" And the answer is, \"Hunt  then for food, but not for pleasure.\"    All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he  grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as  Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off  in a temper, \"A man's cub is a man's cub, and he must learn all the Law  of the Jungle.\"    \"But think how small he is,\" said the Black Panther, who would have  spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way. \"How can his little head carry  all thy long talk?\"    \"Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is  why I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly,  when he forgets.\"    \"Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?\" Bagheera  grunted. \"His face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.\"    \"Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than  that he should come to harm through ignorance,\" Baloo answered very  earnestly. \"I am now teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that  shall protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all that hunt  on four feet, except his own pack. He can now claim protection, if he  will only remember the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that worth  a little beating?\"    \"Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub. He is no  tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But what are those Master  Words? I am more likely to give help than to ask it\"--Bagheera stretched  out one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end  of it--\"still I should like to know.\"    \"I will call Mowgli and he shall say them--if he will. Come, Little  Brother!\"    \"My head is ringing like a bee tree,\" said a sullen little voice over  their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant,  adding as he reached the ground: \"I come for Bagheera and not for thee,  fat old Baloo!\"    \"That is all one to me,\" said Baloo, though he was hurt and grieved.  \"Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught  thee this day.\"    \"Master Words for which people?\" said Mowgli, delighted to show off.  \"The jungle has many tongues. I know them all.\"    \"A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank  their teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank  old Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People,  then--great scholar.\"    \"We be of one blood, ye and I,\" said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear  accent which all the Hunting People use.    \"Good. Now for the birds.\"    Mowgli repeated, with the Kite's whistle at the end of the sentence.    \"Now for the Snake-People,\" said Bagheera.    The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his  feet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped  on to Bagheera's back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on  the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at Baloo.    \"There--there! That was worth a little bruise,\" said the brown bear  tenderly. \"Some day thou wilt remember me.\" Then he turned aside to  tell Bagheera how he had begged the Master Words from Hathi the Wild  Elephant, who knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken  Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a water-snake, because  Baloo could not pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe  against all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor  beast would hurt him.    \"No one then is to be feared,\" Baloo wound up, patting his big furry  stomach with pride.    \"Except his own tribe,\" said Bagheera, under his breath; and then aloud  to Mowgli, \"Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this  dancing up and down?\"    Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheera's  shoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him he was  shouting at the top of his voice, \"And so I shall have a tribe of my  own, and lead them through the branches all day long.\"    \"What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?\" said Bagheera.    \"Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,\" Mowgli went on. \"They  have promised me this. Ah!\"    \"Whoof!\" Baloo's big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera's back, and as the  boy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.    \"Mowgli,\" said Baloo, \"thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the  Monkey People.\"    Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and  Bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones.    \"Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people  without a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.\"    \"When Baloo hurt my head,\" said Mowgli (he was still on his back), \"I  went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on  me. No one else cared.\" He snuffled a little.    \"The pity of the Monkey People!\" Baloo snorted. \"The stillness of the  mountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?\"    \"And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and  they--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said  I was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their  leader some day.\"    \"They have no leader,\" said Bagheera. \"They lie. They have always lied.\"    \"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken  among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do  not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad  Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again.\"    \"Listen, man-cub,\" said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on  a hot night. \"I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the  peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.  They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own,  but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,  and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are  without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and  pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the  jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all  is forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not  drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do  not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever  heard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?\"    \"No,\" said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo  had finished.    \"The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds.  They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they  have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle"]]]
