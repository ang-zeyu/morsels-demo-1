So far all had gone well, and as long as they remained in the rich and  beautiful Italian plains, Suovarow had nothing but praise for the  courage and devotion of his soldiers. But when to the fertile fields of  Lombardy, watered by its beautiful river, succeeded the rough ways of  the Levantine, and when the lofty summits of the St. Gothard, covered  with the eternal snows, rose before them, their enthusiasm was quenched,  their energy disappeared, and melancholy forebodings filled the hearts  of these savage children of the North.    Unexpected grumblings ran through the ranks; then suddenly the vanguard  stopped, and declared that it would go no farther. In vain Foedor, who  commanded a company, begged and entreated his own men to set an example  by continuing the march: they threw down their arms, and lay down beside  them. Just as they had given this proof of insubordination, fresh  murmurs, sounding like an approaching storm, rose from the rear of the  army: they were caused by the sight of Souvarow, who was riding from the  rear to the vanguard, and who arrived at the front accompanied by this  terrible proof of mutiny and insubordination. When he reached the head  of the column, the murmurings had developed into imprecations.    Then Souvarow addressed his soldiers with that savage eloquence to which  he owed the miracles he had effected with them, but cries of \"Retreat!  Retreat!\" drowned his voice. Then he chose out the most mutinous, and  had them thrashed until they were overcome by this shameful punishment:  But the thrashings had no more influence than the exhortation, and the  shouts continued. Souvarow saw that all was lost if he did not employ  some powerful and unexpected means of regaining the mutineers. He  advanced towards Foedor. \"Captain,\" said he, \"leave these fools here,  take eight non-commissioned officers and dig a grave.\" Foedor,  astonished, gazed at his general as though demanding an explanation of  this strange order. \"Obey orders,\" said Souvarow.    Foedor obeyed, and the eight men set to work; and ten minutes later the  grave was dug, greatly to the astonishment of the whole army, which had  gathered in a semicircle on the rising slopes of the two hills which  bordered the road, standing as if on the steps of a huge amphitheatre.    Souvarow dismounted from his horse, broke his sword in two and threw it  into the grave, detached his epaulets one by one and threw them after  his sword, dragged off the decorations which covered his breast and cast  these after the sword and epaulets, and then, stripping himself naked,  he lay down in the grave himself, crying in a loud voice--    \"Cover me with earth! Leave your general here. You are no longer my  children, and I am no longer your father; nothing remains to me but  death.\"    At these strange words, which were uttered in so powerful a voice that  they were heard by the whole army, the Russian grenadiers threw  themselves weeping into the grave, and, raising their general, asked  pardon of him, entreating him to lead them again against the enemy.    \"At last,\" cried Souvarow, \"I recognise my children again. To the  enemy!\"    Not cries but yells of joy greeted his words. Souvarav dressed himself  again, and whilst he was dressing the leaders of the mutiny crept in the  dust to kiss his feet. Then, when his epaulets were replaced on his  shoulders, and when his decorations again shone on his breast, he  remounted his horse, followed by the army, the soldiers swearing with  one voice that they would all die rather than abandon their father.    The same day Souvarow attacked Aerolo; but his luck had turned: the  conqueror of Cassano, Trebia, and Novi had left his good-fortune behind  in the plains of Italy. For twelve hours six hundred French opposed  three thousand Russian grenadiers beneath the walls of the town, and so  successfully that night fell without Souvarow being able to defeat them.  Next day he marched the whole of his troops against this handful of  brave men, but the sky clouded over and the wind blew a bitter rain into  the faces of the Russians; the French profited by this circumstance to  beat a retreat, evacuating the valley of Ursern, crossing the Reuss, and  taking up their position on the heights of the Furka and Grimsel. One  portion of the Russian army's design had been achieved, they were  masters of the St. Gothard. It is true that as soon as they marched  farther on, the French would retake it and cut off their retreat; but  what did this matter to Souvarow? Did he not always march forward?    He marched on, then, without worrying about that which was behind him,  reached Andermatt, cleared Trou d'Ury, and found Lecourbe guarding the  defile of the Devil's Bridge with fifteen hundred men. There the  struggle began again; for three days fifteen hundred Frenchmen kept  thirty thousand Russians at bay. Souvarow raged like a lion trapped in a  snare, for he could not understand this change of fortune. At last, on  the fourth day, he heard that General Korsakoff, who had preceded him  and who was to rejoin him later, had been beaten by Molitor, and that  Massena had recaptured Zurich and occupied the canton of Glaris.  Souvarow now gave up the attempt to proceed up the valley of the Reuss,  and wrote to Korsakoff and Jallachieh, \"I hasten to retrieve your  losses; stand firm as ramparts: you shall answer to me with your heads  for every step in retreat that you take.\" The aide-de-camp was also  charged to communicate to the Russian and Austrian generals a verbal  plan of battle. Generals Linsken and Jallachieh were to attack the  French troops separately and then to join the forces in the valley of  Glaris, into which Souvarow himself was to descend by the Klon-Thal,  thus hemming Molitor in between two walls of iron.    Souvarow was so sure that this plan would be successful, that when he  arrived on the borders of the lake of Klon-Thal, he sent a bearer with a  flag of truce, summoning Molitor to surrender, seeing that he was  surrounded on every side.    Molitor replied, to the field-marshal that his proposed meeting with his  generals had failed, as he had beaten them one after the other, and  driven them back into the Grisons, and that moreover, in retaliation, as  Massena was advancing by Muotta, it was he, Souvarow, who was between  two fires, and therefore he called upon him to lay down his arms  instead.    On hearing this strange reply, Souvarow thought that he must be  dreaming, but soon recovering himself and realising the danger of his  position in the defiles, he threw himself on General Molitor, who  received him at the point of the bayonet, and then closing up the pass  with twelve hundred men, the French succeeded in holding fifteen to  eighteen thousand Russians in check for eight hours. At length night  came, and Molitor evacuated the Klon Thal, and retired towards the  Linth, to defend the bridges of Noefels and Mollis.    The old field-marshal rushed like a torrent over Glaris and Miltodi;  there he learnt that Molitor had told him the truth, and that Jallachieh  and Linsken had been beaten and dispersed, that Massena was advancing on  Schwitz, and that General Rosenberg, who had been given the defence of  the bridge of Muotta, had been forced to retreat, so that he found  himself in the position in which he had hoped to place Molitor.    No time was to be lost in retreating. Souvarow hurried through the  passes of Engi, Schwauden, and Elm. His flight was so hurried that he  was obliged to abandon his wounded and part of his artillery.  Immediately the French rushed in pursuit among the precipices and  clouds. One saw whole armies passing over places where chamois-hunters  took off their shoes and walked barefoot, holding on by their hands to  prevent themselves from falling. Three nations had come from three  different parts to a meeting-place in the home of the eagles, as if to  allow those nearest God to judge the justice of their cause. There were  times when the frozen mountains changed into volcanoes, when cascades  now filled with blood fell into the valleys, and avalanches of human  beings rolled down the deepest precipices. Death reaped such a harvest  there where human life had never been before, that the vultures,  becoming fastidious through the abundance, picked out only the eyes of  the corpses to carry to their young--at least so says the tradition of  the peasants of these mountains.    Souvarow was able to rally his troops at length in the neighbourhood of  Lindau. He recalled Korsakoff, who still occupied Bregenz; but all his  troops together did not number more than thirty thousand men-all that  remained of the eighty thousand whom Paul had furnished as his  contingent in the coalition. In fifteen days Massena had defeated three  separate armies, each numerically stronger than his own. Souvarow,  furious at having been defeated by these same Republicans whom he had  sworn to exterminate, blamed the Austrians for his defeat, and declared  that he awaited orders from his emperor, to whom he had made known the  treachery of the allies, before attempting anything further with the  coalition.    Paul's answer was that he should immediately return to Russia with his  soldiers, arriving at St. Petersburg as soon as possible, where a  triumphal entry awaited them.    The same ukase declared that Souvarow should be quartered in the  imperial palace for the rest of his life, and lastly that a monument  should be raised to him in one of the public places of St. Petersburg.    Foedor was thus about to see Vaninka once more. Throughout the campaign,  where there was a chance of danger, whether in the plains of Italy, in  the defiles of Tesino, or on the glaciers of Mount Pragal, he was the  first to throw himself into it, and his name had frequently been  mentioned as worthy of distinction. Souvarow was too brave himself to be  prodigal of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#5)"],[1,"a strange shudder  when she heard the proposal. Remembrance of the prediction made to her  returned immediately to her mind. The recent and ill explained attempt  to poison her, too, very naturally added to her fears.    Without directly and positively suspecting her brothers-in-law of that  crime, she knew that in them she had two implacable enemies. This  journey to a little town, this abode in a lonely castle, amid new,  unknown neighbours, seemed to her of no good omen; but open opposition  would have been ridiculous. On what grounds, indeed, could she base  resistance? The marquise could only own her terrors by accusing her  husband and her brothers-in-law. And of what could she accuse them? The  incident of the poisoned cream was not a conclusive proof. She resolved  accordingly to lock up all her fears in her heart, and to commit herself  to the hands of God.    Nevertheless, she would not leave Avignon without signing the will which  she had contemplated making ever since M. de Nocheres' death. A notary  was called in who drew up the document. The Marquise de Ganges made her  mother, Madame de Rossan, her sole inheritor, and left in her charge the  duty of choosing between the testatrix's two children as to which of  them should succeed to the estate. These two children were, one a boy of  six years old, the other a girl of five. But this was not enough for the  marquise, so deep was her impression that she would not survive this  fatal journey; she gathered together, secretly and at night, the  magistrates of Avignon and several persons of quality, belonging to the  first families of the town, and there, before them, verbally at first,  declared that, in case of her death, she begged the honourable witnesses  whom she had assembled on purpose, not to recognise as valid, voluntary,  or freely written anything except the will which she had signed the day  before, and affirmed beforehand that any later will which might be  produced would be the effect of fraud or of violence. Then, having made  this verbal declaration, the marquise repeated it in writing, signed the  paper containing it, and gave the paper to be preserved by the honour of  those whom she constituted its guardians. Such a precaution, taken with  such minute detail, aroused the lively curiosity of her hearers. Many  pressing questions were put to the marquise, but nothing could be  extracted from her except that she had reasons for her action which she  could not declare. The cause of this assemblage remained a secret, and  every person who formed part of it promised the marquise not to reveal  it.    On the next day, which was that preceding her departure for Ganges, the  marquise visited all the charitable institutions and religious  communities in Avignon; she left liberal alms everywhere, with the  request that prayers and masses should be said for her, in order to  obtain from God's grace that she should not be suffered to die without  receiving the sacraments of the Church. In the evening, she took leave  of all her friends with the affection and the tears of a person  convinced that she was bidding them a last farewell; and finally she  spent the whole night in prayer, and the maid who came to wake her found  her kneeling in the same spot where she, had left her the night before.    The family set out for Ganges; the journey was performed without  accident. On reaching the castle, the marquise found her mother-in-law  there; she was a woman of remarkable distinction and piety, and her  presence, although it was to be but temporary, reassured the poor  fearful marquise a little. Arrangements had been made beforehand at the  old castle, and the most convenient and elegant of the rooms had been  assigned to the marquise; it was on the first floor, and looked out upon  a courtyard shut in on all sides by stables.    On the first evening that she was to sleep here, the marquise explored  the room with the greatest attention. She inspected the cupboards,  sounded the walls, examined the tapestry, and found nothing anywhere  that could confirm her terrors, which, indeed, from that time began to  decrease. At the end of a certain time; however, the marquis's mother  left Ganges to return to Montpellier. Two, days after her departure, the  marquis talked of important business which required him to go back to  Avignon, and he too left the castle. The marquise thus remained alone  with the abbe, the chevalier, and a chaplain named Perette, who had been  attached for five-and-twenty years to the family of the marquis. The  rest of the household consisted of a few servants.    The marquise's first care, on arriving at the castle, had been to  collect a little society for herself in the town. This was easy: not  only did her rank make it an honour to belong to her circle, her kindly  graciousness also inspired at first-sight the desire of having her for a  friend. The marquise thus endured less dulness than she had at first  feared. This precaution was by no means uncalled for; instead of  spending only the autumn at Ganges, the marquise was obliged, in  consequence of letters from her husband, to spend the winter there.  During the whole of this time the abbe and the chevalier seemed to have  completely forgotten their original designs upon her, and had again  resumed the conduct of respectful, attentive brothers. But with all  this, M. de Ganges remained estranged, and the marquise, who had not  ceased to love him, though she began to lose her fear, did not lose her  grief.    One day the abbe entered her room suddenly enough to surprise her before  she had time to dry her tears; the secret being thus half surprised, he  easily obtained a knowledge of the whole. The marquise owned to him that  happiness in this world was impossible for her so long as her husband  led this separate and hostile life. The abbe tried to console her; but  amid his consolations he told her that the grief which she was suffering  had its source in herself; that her husband was naturally wounded by her  distrust of him--a distrust of which the will, executed by her, was a  proof, all the more humiliating because public, and that, while that  will existed, she could expect no advances towards reconciliation from  her husband. For that time the conversation ended there.    Some days later, the abbe came into the marquise's room with a letter  which he had just received from his brother. This letter, supposed  confidential, was filled with tender complaints of his wife's conduct  towards him, and showed, through every sentence, a depth of affection  which only wrongs as serious as those from which the marquis considered  himself to be feeling could counterbalance. The marquise was, at first,  very much touched by this letter; but having soon reflected that just  sufficient time had elapsed since the explanation between herself and  the abbe for the marquis to be informed of it, she awaited further and  stronger proofs before changing her mind.    From day to day, however, the abbe, under the pretext of reconciling the  husband and wife, became more pressing upon the matter of the will, and  the marquise, to whom this insistence seemed rather alarming, began to  experience some of her former fears. Finally, the abbe pressed her so  hard as to make her reflect that since, after the precautions which she  had taken at Avignon, a revocation could have no result, it would be  better to seem to yield rather than irritate this man, who inspired her  with so great a fear, by constant and obstinate refusals. The next time  that he returned to the subject she accordingly replied that she was  ready to offer her husband this new proof of her love if it would bring  him back to her, and having ordered a notary to be sent for, she made a  new will, in the presence of the abbe and the chevalier, and constituted  the marquis her residuary legatee. This second instrument bore date the  5th of May 1667. The abbe and the chevalier expressed the greatest joy  that this subject of discord was at last removed, and offered themselves  as guarantees, on their brother's behalf, of a better future. Some days  were passed in this hope, which a letter from the marquis came to  confirm; this letter at the same time announced his speedy return to  Ganges.    On the 16th of May; the marquise, who for a month or two had not been  well, determined to take medicine; she therefore informed the chemist of  what she wanted, and asked him to make her up something at his  discretion and send it to her the next day. Accordingly, at the agreed  hour in the morning, the draught was brought to the marquise; but it  looked to her so black and so thick that she felt some doubt of the  skill of its compounder, shut it up in a cupboard in her room without  saying anything of the matter, and took from her dressing-case some  pills, of a less efficacious nature indeed, but to which she was  accustomed, and which were not so repugnant to her.    The hour in which the marquise was to take this medicine was hardly over  when the abbe and the chevalier sent to know how she was. She replied  that she was quite well, and invited them to a collation which she was  giving about four o'clock to the ladies who made up her little circle.  An hour afterwards the abbe and the chevalier sent a second time to  inquire after her; the marquise, without paying particular attention to  this excessive civility, which she remembered afterwards, sent word as  before that she was perfectly well. The marquise had remained in bed to  do the honours of her little feast, and never had she felt more  cheerful. At the hour named all her guests arrived; the abbe and the  chevalier were ushered in, and the meal was served. Neither one nor the  other would share it; the abbe indeed sat down to table, but the  chevalier remained leaning on the foot of the bed. The abbe appeared  anxious, and only roused himself with a start from his absorption;"]]]
