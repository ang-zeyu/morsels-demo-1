After Herodotus we must pass over a century and a half, and only  note, in passing, the Physician Ctesias, a contemporary of Xenophon,  who published the account of a voyage to India that he really never  made; and we shall come in chronological order to Pytheas, who was  at once a traveller, geographer, and historian, one of the most  celebrated men of his time. It was about the year B.C. 340 that  Pytheas set out from the columns of Hercules with a single vessel,  but instead of taking a southerly course like his Carthaginian  predecessors, he went northwards, passing by the coasts of Iberia  and Gaul to the furthest points which now form the Cape of  Finisterre, and then he entered the English Channel and came upon  the English coast--the British Isles--of which he was to be the  first explorer. He disembarked at various points on the coast and  made friends with the simple, honest, sober, industrious inhabitants,  who traded largely in tin.    Pytheas ventured still further north, and went beyond the Orcades  Islands to the furthest point of Scotland, and he must have reached  a very high latitude, for during the summer the night only lasted  two hours. After six days further sailing, he came to lands which he  calls Thule, probably the Jutland or Norway of the present day,  beyond which he could not pass, for he says, \"there was neither land,  sea, nor air there.\" He retraced his course, and changing it  slightly, he came to the mouth of the Rhine, to the country of the  Ostians, and, further inland, to Germany. Thence he visited the  mouth of the Tanais, that is supposed to be the Elbe or the Oder,  and he retuned to Marseilles, just a year after leaving his native  town. Pytheas, besides being such a brave sailor, was a remarkably  scientific man: he was the first to discover the influence that the  moon exercises on the tides, and to notice that the polar star is  not situated at the exact spot at which the axis of the globe is  supposed to be. Some years after the time of Pytheas, about B.C. 326  a Greek traveller made his name famous. This was Nearchus, a native  of Crete, one of Alexander's admirals, and he was charged to visit  all the coast of Asia from the mouth of the Indus to that of the  Euphrates. When Alexander first resolved that this expedition should  take place, which had for its object the opening up of a  communication between India and Egypt, he was at the upper part of  the Indus. He furnished Nearchus with a fleet of thirty-three  galleys, of some vessels with two decks, and a great number of  transport ships, and 2000 men. Nearchus came down the Indus in about  four months, escorted on either bank of the river by Alexander's  armies, and after spending seven months in exploring the Delta, he  set sail and followed the west line of what we call Beloochistan in  the present day.    He put to sea on the second of October, a month before the winter  storms had taken a direction that was favourable to his purpose, so  that the commencement of his voyage was disastrous, and in forty  days he had scarcely made eighty miles in a westerly direction. He  touched first at Stura and at Corestis, which do not seem to answer  to any of the now-existing villages on the coast; then at the Island  of Crocala, which forms the bay of Caranthia. Beaten back by  contrary winds, after doubling the cape of Monze, the fleet took  refuge in a natural harbour that its commander thought that he could  fortify as a defence against the attacks of the barbarous natives,  who, even at the present day, keep up their character as pirates.    After spending twenty-four days in this harbour, Nearchus put to sea  again on the 3rd of November. Severe gales often obliged him to keep  very near the coast, and when this was the case he was obliged to  take all possible precautions to defend himself from the attacks of  the ferocious Beloochees, who are described by eastern historians  \"as a barbarous nation, with long dishevelled hair, and long flowing  beards, who are more like bears or satyrs than human beings.\" Up to  this time, however, no serious disaster had happened to the fleet,  but on the 10th of November in a heavy gale two galleys and a ship  sank. Nearchus then anchored at Crocala, and there he was met by a  ship laden with corn that Alexander had sent out to him, and he was  able to supply each vessel with provisions for ten days.    After many disasters and a skirmish with some of the natives,  Nearchus reached the extreme point of the land of the Orites, which  is marked in modern geography by Cape Morant. Here, he states in his  narrative that the rays of the sun at mid-day are vertical, and  therefore there are no shadows of any kind; but this is surely a  mistake, for at this time in the Southern hemisphere the sun is in  the Tropic of Capricorn; and, beyond this, his vessels were always  some degrees distant from the Tropic of Cancer, therefore even in  the height of summer this phenomenon could not have taken place, and  we know that his voyage was in winter.    Circumstances seemed now rather more in his favour; for the time of  the eastern monsoon was over, when he sailed along the coast which  is inhabited by a tribe called Ichthyophagi, who subsist solely on  fish, and from the failure of all vegetation are obliged to feed  even their sheep upon the same food. The fleet was now becoming very  short of provisions; so after doubling Cape Posmi Nearchus took a  pilot from those shores on board his own vessel, and with the wind  in their favour they made rapid progress, finding the country less  bare as they advanced, a few scattered trees and shrubs being  visible from the shore. They reached a little town, of the name of  which we have no record, and as they were almost without food  Nearchus surprised and took possession of it, the inhabitants making  but little resistance. Canasida, or Churbar as we call it, was their  next resting-place, and at the present day the ruins of a town are  still visible in the bay. But their corn was now entirely exhausted,  and though they tried successively at Canate, Trois, and Dagasira  for further supplies, it was all in vain, these miserable little  towns not being able to furnish more than enough for their own  consumption. The fleet had neither corn nor meat, and they could not  make up their minds to feed upon the tortoises that abound in that  part of the coast.    Just as they entered the Persian Gulf they encountered an immense  number of whales, and the sailors were so terrified by their size  and number, that they wished to fly; it was not without much  difficulty that Nearchus at last prevailed upon them to advance  boldly, and they soon scattered their formidable enemies.    [Illustration: Nearchus leading on his followers against the  monsters of the deep.]    Having changed their westerly course for a north-easterly one, they  soon came upon fertile shores, and their eyes were refreshed by the  sight of corn-fields and pasture-lands, interspersed with all kinds  of fruit-trees except the olive. They put into Badis or Jask, and  after leaving it and passing Maceta or Mussendon, they came in sight  of the Persian Gulf, to which Nearchus, following the geography of  the Arabs, gave the misnomer of the Red Sea.    They sailed up the gulf, and after one halt reached Harmozia, which  has since given its name to the little island of Ormuz. There he  learnt that Alexander's army was only five days' march from him, and  he disembarked at once, and hastened to meet it. No news of the  fleet having reached the army for twenty-one weeks, they had given  up all hope of seeing it again, and great was Alexander's joy when  Nearchus appeared before him, though the hardships he had endured  had altered him almost beyond recognition. Alexander ordered games  to be celebrated and sacrifices offered up to the gods; then  Nearchus returned to Harmozia, as he wished to go as far as Susa  with the fleet, and set sail again, having invoked Jupiter the  Deliverer.    He touched at some of the neighbouring islands, probably those of  Arek and Kismis, and soon afterwards the vessels ran aground, but  the advancing tide floated them again, and after passing Bestion,  they arrived at the island of Keish, that is sacred to Mercury and  Venus. This was the boundary-line between Karmania and Persia. As  they advanced along the Persian coast, they visited different places,  Gillam, Indarabia, Shevou, &c., and at the last-named was found a  quantity of wheat which Alexander had sent for the use of the  explorers.    Some days after this they came to the mouth of the river Araxes,  that separates Persia from Susiana, and thence they reached a large  lake situated in the country now called Dorghestan, and finally  anchored near the village of Degela, at the source of the Euphrates,  having accomplished their project of visiting all the coast lying  between the Euphrates and Indus. Nearchus returned a second time to  Alexander, who rewarded him magnificently, and placed him in command  of his fleet. Alexander's wish, that the whole of the Arabian coast  should be explored as far as the Red Sea, was never fulfilled, as he  died before the expedition was arranged.    It is said that Nearchus became governor of Lysia and Pamphylia, but  in his leisure time he wrote an account of his travels, which has  unfortunately perished, though not before Arian had made a complete  analysis of it in his Historia Indica. It seems probable that  Nearchus fell in the battle of Ipsu, leaving behind him the  reputation of being a very able commander; his voyage may be looked  upon as an event of no small importance in the history of navigation.    We must not omit to mention a most hazardous attempt made in B.C.  146, by Eudoxus of Cyzicus, a geographer living at the court of  Euergetes II, to sail round Africa. He had visited Egypt and the  coast of India, when this far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24780"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from her Majesty's correspondence (#5)"],[1,"written to offend England, and on the contrary frankly proves _us_ to  be immensely superior to the French Navy in every way.          _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _4th June 1844._    MY BELOVED UNCLE,--I gave Louise a long and detailed description of  the Emperor,[13] etc. The papers are full of the details. A great  event and a great compliment _his_ visit certainly is, and the  people _here_ are extremely flattered at it. He is certainly a _very  striking_ man; still very handsome; his profile is _beautiful_, and  his manners _most_ dignified and graceful; extremely civil--quite  alarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and _politesses_. But  the expression of the _eyes_ is _formidable_, and unlike anything I  ever saw before. He gives me and Albert the impression of a man who is  _not_ happy, and on whom the weight of his immense power and position  weighs heavily and painfully; he seldom smiles, and when he does  the expression is _not_ a happy one. He is very easy to get on with.  Really, it seems like a dream when I think that we breakfast and walk  out with _this_ greatest of all earthly Potentates as quietly as if we  walked, etc., with Charles or any one. We took him, with the dear good  King of Saxony,[14] who is a great contrast to the _Czar_ (and with  whom I am _quite_ at my ease), to Adelaide Cottage after breakfast.  The grass here is just as if it had been burned with fire. _How_ many  different Princes have we not gone the same round with!! The children  are much admired by the _Sovereigns_--(how _grand_ this sounds!)--and  Alice allowed the Emperor to take her in his arms, and kissed him _de  son propre accord_. We are always so thankful that they are _not_ shy.  Both the Emperor and the King are _quite_ enchanted with Windsor. The  Emperor said very _poliment_: \"C'est digne de vous, Madame.\" I must  say the Waterloo Room lit up with that entire service of gold looks  splendid; and the Reception Room, beautiful to sit in afterwards. The  Emperor praised _my_ Angel very much, saying: \"C'est impossible de  voir un plus joli garcon; il a l'air si noble et si bon\"; which I must  say _is very_ true. The Emperor amused the King and me by saying he  was so _embarrasse_ when people were presented to him, and that  he felt so \"_gauche_\" _en frac_, which certainly he is quite  _unaccustomed_ to wear. If we can do anything to get him to do what is  right by you, we shall be most happy, and Peel and Aberdeen are very  anxious for it. I believe he leaves on Sunday again. To-morrow there  is to be a great review, and on Thursday _I_ shall probably go with  them to the races; _they_ are gone there with Albert to-day, but I  have remained at home.    I think it is time to conclude my long letter.    If the French are angry at this visit, let their dear King and their  Princes come; _they_ will be sure of a _truly affectionate_ reception  on our part. The one which Emperor Nicholas has received is cordial  and civil, _mais ne vient pas du c[oe]ur_.    I humbly beg that any remarks which may _not_ be favourable to our  great visitor may _not_ go _beyond_ you and Louise, and _not_ to  _Paris_. Ever your devoted Niece,    VICTORIA R.        [Footnote 13: The Emperor Nicholas of Russia had just arrived      on a visit to England.]        [Footnote 14: Frederick Augustus II.]          [Pageheading: THE REVIEW]    [Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S IMPRESSIONS]    [Pageheading: THE CZAR NICHOLAS]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    Buckingham Palace, _11th June 1844._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your very kind and long letter of the  7th on Sunday, and thank you very much for it. I am delighted that  my accounts interested you, and I shall try and give you some more  to-day, which you will see come from an unbiassed and impartial mind,  and which I trust therefore _will_ be relied upon. The excitement has  ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and I am still confused about it.  I will go back to where I last left you. The _Revue_[15] on the 5th  was really very interesting, and our reception as well as that of the  Emperor _most_ enthusiastic. Louise tells me you had a review the  same day, and that it also was so hot. Our children were there,  and charmed. On the 6th we went with the Emperor and King to the  races,[16] and I never saw such a crowd; again _here_ the reception  was _most brilliant_. Every evening a large dinner in the Waterloo  Room, and the two last evenings in uniforms, as the Emperor disliked  so being _en frac_, and was quite embarrassed in it. On the 7th we  took him and the King back here, and in the evening had a party of 260  about. On Saturday (8th) my Angel took the Emperor and King to a very  elegant breakfast[17] at Chiswick, which I for prudence' sake did  _not_ go to, but was very sorry for it. In the evening we went to  the Opera (_not_ in State), but they recognised us, and we were most  brilliantly received. I had to force the Emperor forward, as he never  would come forward when I was there, and I was obliged to take him by  the hand and make him appear; it was impossible to be better bred or  more respectful than he was towards me. Well, on Sunday afternoon at  five, he left us (my Angel accompanied him to Woolwich), and he  was much affected at going, and really unaffectedly touched at his  reception and stay, the simplicity and quietness of which told upon  his love of domestic life, which is very great. I will now (having  told _all_ that has passed) give you _my_ opinion and feelings on the  subject, which I may say are Albert's also. I was extremely against  the visit, fearing the _gene_, and bustle, and even at first, I did  not feel at _all_ to like it, but by living in the same house together  quietly and unrestrainedly (and this Albert, and with great truth,  says is the great advantage of these visits, that I not only _see_  these great people but _know_ them), I got to know the Emperor and he  to know me. There is much about him which I cannot help liking, and  I think his character is _one_ which should be understood, and  looked upon for _once_ as it is. He is stern and severe--with fixed  principles of _duty_ which _nothing_ on earth will make him change;  very _clever_ I do _not_ think him, and his mind is an uncivilised  one; his education has been neglected; politics and military concerns  are the only things he takes great interest in; the arts and all  softer occupations he is insensible to, but he is sincere, I am  certain, _sincere_ even in his most despotic acts, from a sense that  that _is_ the _only_ way to govern; he is not, I am sure, aware of the  dreadful cases of individual misery which he so often causes, for I  can see by various instances that he is kept in utter ignorance of  _many_ things, which his people carry out in most corrupt ways, while  he thinks that he is extremely just. He thinks of general measures,  but does not look into detail. And I am sure _much_ never reaches  his ears, and (as you observed), how can it? He asked for _nothing_  whatever, has merely expressed his great anxiety to be upon the best  terms with us, but _not_ to the _exclusion of others_, only let things  remain as they are.... He is I should say, too frank, for he talks  so openly before people, which he should not do, and with difficulty  restrains himself. His anxiety _to be believed_ is _very_ great, and  I must say his personal promises I _am inclined_ to believe; then his  feelings are very strong; he _feels_ kindness deeply--and his love for  his wife and children, and for all children, is _very_ great. He has a  strong feeling for domestic life, saying to me, when our children were  in the room: \"Voila les doux moments de notre vie.\" He was not only  civil, but extremely kind _to us both_, and spoke in the highest  praise of dearest Albert to Sir Robert Peel, saying he wished any  Prince in Germany had that ability and sense; he showed Albert great  confidence, and I _think_ it will do great good, as if _he_ praises  him abroad it will have great weight. He is _not_ happy, and that  melancholy which is visible in the countenance made me sad at times;  the sternness of the eyes goes very much off when you know him,  and changes according to his being put out (and he _can_ be much  embarrassed) or not, and also from his being heated, as he suffers  with congestions to the head. My Angel thinks that he is a man  inclined too much to give way to impulse and feeling, which makes him  act wrongly often. His admiration for beauty is very great, and put me  much in mind of you, when he drove out with us, looking out for  pretty people. But he remains very faithful to those he admired  _twenty-eight_ years ago; for instance, Lady Peel, who has hardly  any remains left. Respecting Belgium he did not speak to _me_, but to  Albert and the Ministers. As for unkindly feeling towards _you_, he  disclaims positively any, saying he knew you well, and that you had  served in the Russian Army, etc., but he says those _unfortunate_  Poles are the _only_ obstacle, and that he positively cannot  enter into direct communication _with Belgium_ as long as they are  _employed_. If you could only somehow or other get rid of them, I am  sure the thing would be done at once. We all think he _need_ not  mind this, but I fear he has pledged himself. He admired Charlotte's  picture. _Pour finir_, I must say one more word or two about his  personal appearance. He puts us much in mind of his and our cousins  the Wuertembergs, and has altogether much of the Wuertemberg family  about him. He is bald now, but in his Chevalier Garde Uniform he is  _magnificent_ still, and very _striking_. I cannot deny that we were  in great anxiety when we took him out lest some Pole might make an  attempt, and I always felt thankful when we got him safe home again.  His poor daughter is very ill, I fear. The good King of Saxony[18]  remains another week"]]]
