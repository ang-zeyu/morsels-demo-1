Woodruff.                  BOHEMIAN WAX-WING.]    THE BOHEMIAN WAX-WING.      The Bohemian Wax-wing is interesting for its gipsy-like wanderings, one  winter visiting one country, next season another, often in enormous  flocks, and usually with intervals of many years, so that in former  times their appearance was regarded as sure forebodings of war and  pestilence, their arrival being dreaded as much as that of a comet.  Another interesting feature of its history is the fact that for a long  time this familiar bird eluded the search of the zoologist. Its breeding  habits, and even the place where it breeds, were unknown thirty years  ago, until finally discovered by Mr. Wolley in Lapland, after a diligent  search during four summers. It is also called the European or Common  Silk-tail, and is an inhabitant both of northern Europe and of North  America, though in America the Cedar Bird is more often met with. In the  northern portions of Europe, birch and pine forests constitute its  favorite retreats, and these it seldom quits, except when driven by  unusual severity of weather, or by heavy falls of snow, to seek refuge  in more southern provinces. It is said that even in Russia, Poland, and  southern Scandinavia it is constantly to be seen throughout the entire  winter; that indeed, so rarely does it wander to more southern  latitudes, that in Germany it is popularly supposed to make its  appearance once in seven years. On the occasion of these rare  migrations, the Silk-tails keep together in large flocks, and remain in  any place that affords them suitable food until the supply is exhausted.    These birds are heavy and indolent, exerting themselves rarely except  to satisfy hunger. They live in perfect harmony, and during their  migrations indicate no fear of man, seeking their food in the streets of  the villages and towns. They frequently settle in the trees, remaining  almost motionless for hours together. Their flight is light and  graceful, but on the ground they move with difficulty. Their call note  is a hissing, twittering sound. In summer, insects are their chief food,  while in winter they live principally on berries. The Wax-wing will  devour in the course of twenty-four hours an amount of food equal to the  weight of its own body. In Lapland is the favorite nesting ground of the  Bohemian Wax-wing. The nests are deeply hidden among the boughs of pine  trees, at no great height from the ground; their walls are formed of dry  twigs and scraps from the surrounding branches, and the cavities are  wide, deep, and lined with blades of grass and feathers. There are five  eggs, laid about the middle of June; the shell is bluish or purplish  white, sprinkled with brown, black, or violet spots and streaks, some  of which take the form of a wreath at the broad end. The exquisite  daintiness and softness of the Wax-wing's coat can be compared only to  floss silk.          THE MARSH WREN.          With tail up, and head up,      The Wren begins to sing;      He fills the air with melody,      And makes the alders ring;      We listen to his cadences,      We watch his frisky motions,      We think--his mate attending him--      He's got some nesting notions.--C. C. M.    These Wrens inhabit marshy and weedy bottom lands along river courses,  and have all the brisk manners and habits of the family. This species,  however, has a peculiar habit of building several nests every season,  and it is suggested that these are built to procure protection for the  female, in order that when search is made for the nest where she is  sitting, the male may lure the hunter to an empty nest.    Its song is not unlike that of the House Wren, though less agreeable. It  is a summer resident, arriving in May and departing in September. Its  nest, which is found along borders of rivers, is made of sedge and  grasses suspended near tall reeds. It has been found hanging over a  small stream, suspended from the drooping bough of an alder tree, swayed  to and fro by every breath of air. A careful observer states that a Wren  will forsake her nest when building it, sooner than any other bird known  to him. Disturb her repeatedly when building and she leaves it  apparently without cause; insert your fingers in her tenement and she  will leave it forever. But when the eggs are laid, the Wren will seldom  abandon her treasure, and when her tender brood are depending on her for  food, she will never forsake them, even though the young be handled, or  the female bird be caught on the nest while feeding them. The food of  the Wren is insects, their larvae and eggs, and fruit in season.    This Wren has justly been called a perennial songster. \"In Spring the  love-song of the Wren sounds through the forest glades and hedges, as  the buds are expanding into foliage and his mate is seeking a site for a  cave-like home. And what a series of jerks it is composed of, and how  abruptly he finishes his song, as if suddenly alarmed; but this is his  peculiar habit and common to him alone. In summer we hear his song  morning, noon, and night, go forth for very joyfulness, as he wanders  hither and thither in his leafy bower.\" It is only in the moulting  season that he does not sing.    A lady who used to attract a great number of birds to her garden with  crumbs, seeds, and other dainties, said that when the weather became  cold the Wrens used to gather upon a large branch of a tree, about four  inches beneath another branch. They assembled there in the evening and  packed themselves very comfortably for the night, three or four deep,  apparently for the sake of warmth, the topmost Wren always having his  back pressed against the outer branch as if to keep all steady. Pitying  their forlorn condition, she provided a bedroom for them--a square box  lined with flannel, and with a very small round hole for a door. This  was fastened to the branch, and the birds promptly took possession of  it, their numbers increasing nightly, until at least forty Wrens crowded  into the box which did not seem to afford room for half the number. When  thus assembled they became so drowsy as to permit themselves to be  gently handled.           [Illustration: From col. Chi. Acad. Sciences.                  LONG-BILLED MARSH WREN.]    THE MARSH WRENS.      A happier pair of birds than these little Wrens it would be hard to  find.    They have just come up from taking their morning bath and are going to  sing a while before going to work on their nests.    You see I say nests. That is a strange thing about the Wrens, they build  several nests. I wonder if you can tell why they do this. If you can't,  ask your teacher about it.    It is a little too early in the season or I would have one of the nests  in the picture for you to look at.    I will try to describe it to you, so that you will know it when you see  it. These little Wrens make their nests of coarse grasses, reed stalks,  and such things, lined with fine grasses. It is round like a ball, or  nearly so, and has the opening in the side. They fasten them to the  reeds and bushes.

Harras watched them  attentively for some time and I told him the names of the birds--they  were jays and wood-peckers. The next morning he did not come up to my  room a second time with the maid, although he can generally hardly  contain himself until he has had his breakfast given him. At length,  when he did appear, I asked him if he had seen the birds again, and he  answered \"yes\"; then to my question as to their names he gave \"her\" and  \"spct\" (i.e. \"Haeher\" and \"Specht\" = jay and woodpecker).'\"      \"D. REPORT ON THE DOG ROLAND    \"Little Roland, who received his first tuition from Frau Dr. Moekel,  unfortunately came to an untimely end--owing to an accident.[10]  Concerning this, Frau Dr. Moekel wrote to me in March, 1915, as  follows:          [10] Frau Dr. Moekel taught another young dog, called Lux, as        well as Roland, the former being taken over by a gentleman in        Mannheim. In a protocol dated 14 June, 1914, I stated that Lux        was able to do a certain amount of arithmetic at the age of four        and a half months.    \"'My dear little Roland--whom we called \"Guckerl\" ( = Peep-eyes),  because of his wonderful eyes, has been run over by a motor-car. He  suffered terribly for two days and died on 19 March. His death is not  only a sorrow to me, but a loss to the interests of the cause we have  at heart, for Roland had begun to make the most delightful remarks  quite spontaneously. On the last evening before the accident, he came  to me and--without having been questioned--rapped out: \"Rolf ark bei  (s) d arm roland\" ( = Rolf has badly bitten poor Roland). I was not able  at the time to translate his little utterance, and it was only after  his death that I remembered my notes. Then, on putting them together it  transpired that Roland had been bitten by Rolf because he had chased  Daisy, our kitten.    \"'Roland could recognize money, stamps and bank-notes; he could count  flowers and bricks, and knew all the various colours and scents as well  as count tones, recognize melodies and tell the time.'    \"I have not added my report made with reference to Lola to the above,  the object of my book being to make the reader acquainted with this  dog.\"          MY PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT      I cannot remember whether it was in 1912, or earlier, or possibly even  later, that I heard for the first time of Karl Krall's horses at  Elberfeld. No details then reached me; only just the generalities  relative to their ability to count and spell. Of their fore-runner,  \"der kluge Hans,\" I had as yet heard nothing. I had been a child when  Hans had made his debut, so to speak; he had then vanished and the  odium which had later attached to his name was, therefore, unknown to  me. I may say that I was totally unprejudiced when the news of these  horses reached and, indeed, as there was but little information I did  not interest myself further about the subject, although it had made a  momentary impression on me. A year or two later Professor Kraemer of  Hohenheim arrested public attention by his investigations respecting  animals, and it was there that I heard him deliver a lecture on the  horses and also the dog Rolf of Mannheim, hearing further details from  him in conversation with my father[11] and myself. What I then heard  interested me immensely.          [11] Professor Karl Kindermann, of Hohenheim.    Professor Kraemer was a keen advocate of this subject, but I was chary  of forming any opinion without deeper investigations. The possibility  of \"self-expression\" on the part of animals did not seem to me to be  beyond the bounds of belief, even though some examples which were  supposed to attest to high intelligence seemed to me a little doubtful.  I tried to get more information, but was hindered at the time owing to  the three years' course of studies I was then pursuing at the Hohenheim  School of Agriculture, so that I was neither able to try any  experiments on my own part, nor even to read Krall's great work on the  subject. The entire question, therefore, remained an open one--as far  as I was concerned, although my father had been to Elberfeld to see the  horses, and had,--after making personal tests--come to the conclusion  that everything was above-board and in accordance with what it claimed  to be and that the animals really did give answers which were the  outcome of their own independent thinking. In addition to this I read  the public communications made by Professor Ziegler at Stuttgart, as  well as also his own personal opinions.    Both these gentlemen, Professor Ziegler, as well as Professor Kraemer,  were known to me only in their capacity of serious and conscientious  investigators, men upon whose judgment I might safely rely, so long as  my own experience did not oblige me to take up a different standpoint.  And further, I skimmed over everything that the Press brought forward  of an opposing nature, so that I might know _their_ point of view as  well.    After I had passed my Academic Examination, and taken my Diploma, I  took over, some six months later, the independent management of a big  estate in the Rheinland, which consisted of three hundred acres. (I was  able to do this on the strength of some practical experience I had had  previously in Thueringen apart from my studies.)    After a year and a half I felt sufficiently at home at the work to be  able to turn my attention to such matters of interest as lay outside  that of my daily work, and I now called to mind the subject of the  \"Thinking Horses,\" deciding to attempt some experiments. The approach  of such a solitary season as winter seemed to me particularly suited to  this attempt and I placed myself in communication with Professor  Ziegler so as to hear of a likely animal. It was to be a dog, and--for  preference--a relation of Rolf. Indeed, I felt sure of excellent  results, should my quest meet with success. A dog is of all animals  _the_ one that has for generations associated most with man; its  attachment is of the most intimate and the most faithful nature, so  that by inheritance, as it were, it would seem to be in a greater state  of \"preparedness\" for fulfilling man's behests. Horses, oxen, asses,  pigs, and poultry, etc., are each and all, of course, accustomed to the  guidance of man's hand, but--here in Europe, at all events--they live  their lives apart and are not so domesticated; they cannot, therefore,  form so intimate an acquaintance with man, by means of eye and ear, as  can enable them to comprehend both language and gestures. For practical  purposes horses would seem to come next to dogs in the matter of  intelligence--more particularly Arab horses. An Arab talks to his horse  as he would to a friend, and the sparkle in the eye of this animal  denotes its intelligence. In the matter of actual sensibility, the ox,  the ass, and other creatures have practically nothing in common with  us, showing an utterly foreign type of intelligence, and one, moreover,  which has--owing to the existent century-old customs of keeping them  isolated in their stalls--depressed even such intelligence as was  originally theirs. Creatures of the wild seem only in exceptional cases  to prove amenable to training, however great their intelligence may be  they cannot adapt themselves to man's control, and can as a rule only  imitate, seldom revealing to us any gleam of mental alertness.    Professor Ziegler recommended a bitch which was a descendant of Rolf's  and advised me to pay a visit to Mannheim. I did so, and our interview  was most satisfactory. It lasted three-quarters of an hour, by which  time I had assured myself that the dog could answer, even though he did  not tap my hand, but rapped out his remarks on a piece of cardboard  held by Fraeulein Moekel. Here is the account of my visit:      \"REPORT OF FRAeULEIN KINDERMANN OF HER VISIT TO THE FAMILY OF DR.  MOEKEL, IN MANNHEIM, 11 JANUARY, 1916.    \"After hearing much about the 'thinking animals,' more particularly  about the dog Rolf, and having also with great enthusiasm read  everything I could find on the subject, I became obsessed with the  desire to embark on this study, forming my opinion by tests carried out  myself, thus personally being in a position to approach the subject  with the requisite scientific accuracy.    \"The Moekels assisted my desire with kindly and ready response, placing  a descendant of Rolf at my disposal, and allowing me to acquire some  insight into their 'spelling-method' by watching Rolf at work. Here is  the account of my visit:    \"Rolf was brought into a room where there was no one beyond the family  and myself. Rolf ran eagerly from one to the other and jumped up at me.  Holding up a little packet of biscuits, I said to him:    \"'This is what Professor Ziegler sends you from Stuttgart with many  greetings, and he hopes you are good, and that you will write him a  letter.'    \"I saw from his glance that he understood me, but it was only after  Fraeulein Moekel had most earnestly 'put it to him' that he consented to  rap out a reply. At first it was not easy for me to follow, for--owing  probably to his reluctance--he was not \"working\" distinctly, but by  degrees I accustomed myself to his methods, and was able to \"keep  count\" along with the others. What he rapped out was this:    \"'Lib Deigler, dank fuer fein gegs,[12] die geben nit gegs arm lol[13]  mehr schicken; maedel is lieb, gruss von lol\" ( = Dear Dr. Ziegler,  thanks for nice biscuits: they give no biscuits to poor Lol--send more.  The girl's a dear: greetings from Lol.)'          [12] Gegs = keks; Germans call biscuits \"keks.\"          [13] Here observe that Rolf has the impudence to complain of the        Moekels for not feeding him on sweet biscuits!    "]]]
