[Sidenote: Necessity for Reform.]    These multiplied evils, which checked the spirit of improvement,  called loudly for reform. Councils were assembled for the purpose; but  councils supported, rather than diminished, the evils of which even  princes complained. The reform was not destined to come from  dignitaries in the church or state; not from bishops, nor  philosophers, nor kings, but from an obscure teacher of divinity in a  German university, whom the genius of a reviving and awakened age had  summoned into the field of revolutionary warfare. It was reserved for  Martin Luther to commence the first successful rebellion against the  despotism of Rome, and to give the greatest impulse to freedom of  thought, and a general spirit of reform, which ten centuries had seen.    The most prominent event in modern times is unquestionably the  Protestant Reformation, and it was by far the most momentous in its  results. It gave rise, directly or indirectly, to the great wars of  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as well as to those rival  sects which agitated the theological world. It is connected with the  enterprises of great monarchs, with the struggle of the Huguenots and  Puritans, with the diffusion of knowledge, and with the progress of  civil and religious liberty in Europe. An event, therefore, of such  interest and magnitude, may well be adopted as a starting point in  modern history, and will, accordingly, be the first subject of  especial notice. History is ever most impressive and philosophical  when great changes and revolutions are traced to the agency of great  spiritual ideas. Moreover, modern history is so complicated, that it  is difficult to unravel it except by tracing the agency of great  causes, rather than by detailing the fortunes of kings and nobles.          CHAPTER II.    MARTIN LUTHER AND HIS ASSOCIATES.      [Sidenote: The Early Life of Luther.]    Martin Luther was born the 10th of November, 1483, at Eisleben, in  Saxony. His father was a miner, of Mansfield, and his ancestors were  peasants, who lived near the summit of the Thuringian Forest. His  early years were spent at Mansfield, in extreme poverty, and he earned  his bread by singing hymns before the houses of the village. At the  age of fifteen, he went to Eisenach, to a high school, and at eighteen  entered the university of Erfurt, where he made considerable progress  in the sciences then usually taught, which, however, were confined  chiefly to the scholastic philosophy. He did not know either Greek or  Hebrew, but read the Bible in Latin. In 1505, he took his degree of  bachelor of arts, and, shortly after, his religious struggles  commenced. He had witnessed a fearful tempest, which alarmed him,  while on a visit at his father's house, and he was also much depressed  by the death of an intimate friend. In that age, the serious and the  melancholy generally sought monastic retreats, and Luther, thirsty  after divine knowledge, and anxious to save his soul, resolved to  forsake the world, and become a monk. He entered an Augustinian  monastery at Erfurt, soon after obtaining his first degree. But the  duties and studies of monastic life did not give his troubled soul the  repose he sought. He submitted to all the irksome labors which the  monks imposed; he studied the fathers and the schoolmen; he practised  the most painful austerities, and fastings, and self-lacerations:  still he was troubled with religious fears. His brethren encouraged  his good works, but his perplexities and doubts remained. In this  state of mind, he was found by Staupitz, vicar-general of the order,  who was visiting Erfurt, in his tour of inspection, with a view to  correct the bad morals of the monasteries. He sympathized with Luther  in his religious feelings, treated him with great kindness, and  recommended the reading of the Scriptures, and also the works of St.  Augustine whose theological views he himself had embraced. Although  St. Augustine was a great oracle in the Roman church, still, his  doctrines pertaining to personal salvation differed in spirit from  those which were encouraged by the Roman Catholic divines generally,  who attached less importance to justification by faith than did the  venerated bishop of Hyppo. In that age of abuses, great importance was  attached, by the church, to austerities, penance, and absolutions for  money. But Luther, deeply imbued with the spirit of Augustine, at  length found light, and repose, and joy, in the doctrine of  justification by faith alone. This became more and more the idea of  his life, especially at this time. The firmness of his convictions on  this point became extraordinary, and his spiritual gladness now  equalled his former depression and anxiety. He was soon to find a  sphere for the development of his views.    Luther was consecrated as a priest in 1507, and in 1508 he was invited  by Frederic, Elector of Saxony, to become a professor in the new  university which he had established at Wittemberg. He was now  twenty-five years of age, and the fact, that he should have been  selected, at that early age, to teach dialectics, is a strong argument  in favor of his attainments and genius.    He now began to apply himself to the study of the Greek and Hebrew,  and delivered lectures on biblical theology; and his novel method, and  great enthusiasm, attracted a crowd of students. But his sermons were  more striking even than his lectures, and he was invited, by the  council of Wittemberg, to be the preacher for the city. His eloquence,  his learning, and his zeal, now attracted considerable attention, and  the elector himself visited Wittemberg to hear him preach.    In 1512, he was sent on an embassy to Rome, and, while in Italy,  obtained useful knowledge of the actual state of the hierarchy, and of  morals and religion. Julius II., a warlike pontiff, sat on the throne  of St. Peter; and the \"Eternal City\" was the scene of folly,  dissipation, and clerical extortion. Luther returned to Germany  completely disgusted with every thing he had seen--the levity and  frivolity of the clergy, and the ignorance and vices of the people. He  was too earnest in his religious views and feelings to take much  interest in the works of art, or the pleasures, which occupied the  attention of the Italians; and the impression of the general iniquity  and corruption of Rome never passed away, and probably gave a new  direction to his thoughts.    [Sidenote: Luther's Early Religious Struggles.]    On his return, in 1512, he was made doctor of divinity, then a great  distinction, and renewed his lectures in the university with great  ardor. He gave a new impulse to the studies, and a new form to the  opinions of both professors and students. Lupinus and Carlstadt, his  colleagues, were converts to his views. All within his sphere were  controlled by his commanding genius, and extraordinary force of  character. He commenced war upon the schoolmen, and was peculiarly  hostile to Thomas Aquinas, whom he accused of Pelagianism. He also  attacked Aristotle, the great idol of the schools, and overwhelmed  scholasticism with sarcasm and mockery.    Such was the state of things when the preachers of indulgences, whom  Leo X. had encouraged, in order to raise money for St. Peter's Church,  arrived in the country round the Elbe. They had already spread over  Germany, Switzerland, and France. Their luxury and extravagance were  only equalled by their presumption and insolence. All sorts of crime  were pardoned by these people for money. Among the most remarkable of  these religious swindlers and peddlers was Tetzel. He was a friar of  the Dominicans, apostolical commissioner, inquisitor, and bachelor of  theology. He united profligate morals with great pretensions to  sanctity; was somewhat eloquent, so far as a sonorous voice was  concerned, and was very bold and haughty, as vulgar men, raised to  eminence and power, are apt to be. But his peculiarity consisted in  the audacity of his pretensions, and his readiness in inventing  stories to please the people, ever captivated by rhetoric and  anecdote. \"Indulgences,\" said he, \"are the most precious and sublime  of God's gifts.\" \"I would not exchange my privileges for those of St.  Peter in heaven; for I have saved more souls, with my indulgences,  than he, with his sermons.\" \"There is no sin so great that the  indulgence cannot remit it: even repentance is not necessary:  indulgences save not the living alone,--they save the dead.\" \"The very  moment that the money clinks against the bottom of this chest, the  soul escapes from purgatory, and flies to heaven.\" \"And do you know  why our Lord distributes so rich a grace? The dilapidated Church of  St. Peter and St. Paul is to be restored, which contains the bodies of  those holy apostles, and which are now trodden, dishonored, and  polluted.\"    [Sidenote: The Ninety-Five Propositions.]    Tetzel found but few sufficiently enlightened to resist him, and he  obtained great sums from the credulous people. This abomination  excited Luther's intensest detestation; and he accordingly wrote  ninety-five propositions, and nailed them, in 1517, to the gates of  the church, in which he denounced the traffic in indulgences, and  traced the doctrine of absolution to the usurped power of the pope. He  denied the value of his absolution, and maintained that the divine  favor would only be granted on the condition of repentance and faith.    In these celebrated propositions, he struck at the root of scholastic  absurdities, and also of papal pretensions. The spirit which they  breathed was bold, intrepid, and magnanimous. They electrified  Germany, and gave a shock to the whole papal edifice. They had both a  religious and a political bearing; religious, in reference to the  grounds of justification,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#5)"],[1," as nearly as possible in the very words  of the original version, with only a few arbitrary reiterations, and  otherwise only varied according to the individual talents of the  narrator, as to the mode of recitation, gesture, &c. The only real  discretionary power allowed by the audience to the narrator is the  insertion of a few peculiar passages from other traditions; but even in  that case no alteration of these original or elementary materials used  in the composition of tales is admissible. Generally, even the smallest  deviation from the original version will be taken notice of and  corrected, if any intelligent person happens to be present. This  circumstance,\" he adds, \"accounts for their existence in an unaltered  shape through ages; for had there been the slightest tendency to  variation on the part of the narrator, or relish for it on that of the  audience, every similarity of these tales, told in such widely-separated  countries, would certainly have been lost in the course of centuries.\"  Here the audience, wedded to the accustomed formularies, is represented  as controlling any inclination to variation on the reciter's part. How  far such an attitude of mind may have been produced by previous  repetitions in the same words we need not inquire. Certain it is that  accuracy would be likely to generate the love of accuracy, and _that_  again to react so as to compel adherence to the form of words which the  ear had been led to expect. Readers of Grimm will remember the anxiety  betrayed by a peasant woman of Niederzwehr, near Cassel, that her very  words and expressions should be taken down. They who have studied the  records collectors have made of the methods they have adopted, and the  assistance they have received from narrators who have understood and  sympathized with their purpose, will not find anything exceptional in  this woman's conduct.[13]    Nor must we overlook the effect of dramatic and pantomimic action. At  first sight action, like that of Messia or the Arab reciter, might seem  to make for freedom in narration. But it may well be questioned if this  be so to any great extent. For in a short time certain attitudes, looks,  and gestures become inseparably wedded, not only in the actor's mind,  but also in the minds of the audience who have grown accustomed to them,  with the passages and the very words to which they are appropriate. The  eye as well as the ear learns what to expect, with results proportioned  to the comparative values of those two senses as avenues of knowledge.  The history of the stage, the observation of our own nurseries, will  show with how much suspicion any innovation on the mode of interpreting  an old favourite is viewed.    To sum up: it would appear that national differences in the manner of  story-telling are for the most part superficial. Whether told by men to  men in the bazaar or the coffee-house of the East, or by old men or  women to children in the sacred recesses of the European home, or by men  to a mixed assembly during the endless nights of the Arctic Circle, or  in the huts of the tropical forest, and notwithstanding the license  often taken by a professional reciter, the endeavour to render to the  audience just that which the speaker has himself received from his  predecessors is paramount. The faithful delivery of the tradition is the  principle underlying all variation of manner; and it is not confined to  any one race or people. It is not denied that changes do take place as  the story passes from one to another. This indeed is the inevitable  result of the play of the two counteracting forces just described--the  conservative tendency and the tendency to variation. It is the condition  of development; it is what makes a science of Folk-tales both necessary  and possible. Nor can it be denied that some changes are voluntary. But  the voluntary changes are rare; and the involuntary changes are only  such as are natural and unavoidable if the story is to continue its  existence in the midst of the ever-shifting social organism of humanity.  The student must, therefore, know something of the habits, the natural  and social surroundings, and the modes of the thought of the people  whose stories he examines. But this known, it is not difficult to  decipher the documents.    There is, however, one caution--namely, to be assured that the documents  are gathered direct from the lips of the illiterate story-teller, and  set down with accuracy and good faith. Every turn of phrase, awkward or  coarse though it may seem to cultured ears, must be unrelentingly  reported; and every grotesquery, each strange word, or incomprehensible  or silly incident, must be given without flinching. Any attempt to  soften down inconsistencies, vulgarities or stupidities, detracts from  the value of the text, and may hide or destroy something from which the  student may be able to make a discovery of importance to science.  Happily the collectors of the present day are fully alive to this need.  The pains they take to ensure correctness are great, and their  experiences in so doing are often very interesting. Happily, too, the  student soon learns to distinguish the collections whose sincerity is  certain from those furbished up by literary art. The latter may have  purposes of amusement to serve, but beyond that they are of  comparatively little use.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Campbell, vol. i. pp. xii. xiv. lvii.

Sagas and _Maerchen_--Fairy Tales based upon ideas familiar to       savages--The Doctrine of Spirits--The Doctrine of       Transformation--Totemism--Death--Witchcraft--The predominance of       imagination over reason in savages--Method of the inquiry.      Fairy Tales, as defined in the previous chapter, fall under two heads.  Under the first we may place all those stories which relate to definite  supernatural beings, or definite orders of supernatural beings, held  really to exist, and the scenes of which are usually laid in some  specified locality. Stories belonging to this class do not necessarily,  however, deal with the supernatural. Often they are told of historical  heroes, or persons believed to have once lived. For instance, the  legends of Lady Godiva and Whittington and his Cat, which, however  improbable, contain nothing of the supernatural, must be reckoned under  this head equally with the story of the Luck of Edenhall, or the Maori  tale of the Rending asunder of Heaven and Earth. In other words, this  class is by no means confined to Fairy Tales, but includes all stories  which are, or at all events have been up to recent years, and in the  form in which they come to us, looked upon as narratives of actual  occurrences. They are called _Sagas_. The other class of tales consists  of such as are told simply for amusement, like Jack and the Beanstalk,  Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Puss in Boots. They may embody  incidents believed in other countries, or in other stages of  civilization, to be true in fact; but in the form in which we have them  this belief has long since been dropped. In general, the reins are  thrown upon the neck of the imagination; and, marvellous though the  story be, it cannot fail to find acceptance, because nobody asserts that  its events ever took place, and nobody desires to bring down its flights  to the level either of logic or experience. Unlike the saga, it binds  the conscience neither of teller nor of listener; its hero or heroine  has no historical name or fame, either national or local; and being  untrammelled either by history or probability, the one condition the tale  is expected to fulfil is to end happily. Stories of this class are  technically called _Maerchen_: we have no better English name for them  than _Nursery Tales_.    If we inquire which of these two species of tales is the earlier in the  history of culture, it seems that the priority must be given to sagas.  The matter, indeed, is not quite free from doubt, because low down in  the scale of civilization, as among the Ainos of Japan, stories are told  which appear to be no more than _maerchen_; and because, on the other  hand, it is at all times easier, even for experienced collectors, to  obtain sagas than _maerchen_. But among the lower races, a vastly  preponderating number of tales recorded by Europeans who have lived with  them on the terms of the greatest intimacy is told to account for the  phenomena of nature, or their own history and organization. From many  savage peoples we have no other stories at all; and it is not uncommon  to find narratives at bottom identical with some of these told as  _maerchen_ among nations that have reached a higher plane. In these  cases, at all events, it looks as if the tales, or tales from which they  had been derived, had been originally believed as true, and,"]]]
