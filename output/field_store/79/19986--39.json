These texts are both quite  garbled, but so far as one may understand them, it seems that the types  of spheres and globes mentioned are more akin to those current in China  than in the West. The relevant portions of text are as follows (italics  supplied):      The circle of the horizon is midway of the sphere. As    covered with a casing and as left uncovered, it is the    sphere surrounded by Lok[=a]loka [the mountain range which    formed the boundary of the universe in puranic geography].    By the application of water is made ascertainment of the    revolution of time. One may construct a sphere-instrument    combined with quicksilver: this is a mystery; if plainly    described, it would be generally intelligible in the    world. Therefore let the supreme sphere be constructed    according to the instruction of the preceptor [guru]. In    each successive age this construction, having become lost,    is, by the Sun's favour, again revealed to some one or    other, at his pleasure. So also, one should construct    instruments in order to ascertain time. When quite alone,    one should apply quicksilver to the wonder-causing    instrument. By the gnomon, staff, arc, wheel, instruments    for taking the shadow of various kinds.... By    water-instruments, the vessel, by the peacock, man,    monkey, and by stringed sand-receptacles one may determine    time accurately. Quicksilver-holes, water, and cords, and    oil and water, mercury and sand are used in these: these    applications, too, are difficult.       _S[=u]rya Siddh[=a]nta_, xiii, 15-22,        E. Burgess' translation, New Haven, 1860.    [Illustration: Figure 9.--ANTIKYTHERA MACHINE, PARTIAL RECONSTRUCTION  BY THEOPHANIDIS (see footnote 16).]      A self-revolving instrument [or swayanvaha yantra]: Make a    wheel of light wood and in its circumference put hollow    spokes all having bores of the same diameter, and let them    be placed at equal distances from each other; and let    them also be placed at an angle verging somewhat from the    perpendicular: then half fill these hollow spokes with    mercury; the wheel thus filled will, when placed on an    axis supported by two posts, revolve of itself.      Or scoop out a canal in the tire of the wheel and then    plastering leaves of the T[.a]la tree over this canal with    wax, fill one half of this canal with water and the other    half with mercury, till the water begins to come out, and    then cork up the orifice left open for filling the wheel.    The wheel will then revolve of itself, drawn around by the    water.      Description of a syphon: Make up a tube of copper or other    metal, and bend it in the form of an Ankus'a or elephant    hook, fill it with water and stop up both ends. And then    putting one end into a reservoir of water let the other    end remain suspended outside. Now uncork both ends. The    water of the reservoir will be wholly sucked up and fall    outside.      Now attach to the rim of the before described    self-revolving wheel a number of water-pots, and place the    wheel and these pots like the water wheel so that the    water from the lower end of the tube flowing into them on    one side shall set the wheel in motion, impelled by the    additional weight of the pots thus filled. The water    discharge from the pots as they reach the bottom of the    revolving wheel, should be drawn off into the reservoir    before alluded to by means of a water-course or pipe.      The self-revolving machine [mentioned by _Lalla_, etc.]    which has a tube with its lower end open is a vulgar    machine on account of its being dependant, because that    which manifests an ingenious and not a rustic contrivance    is said to be a machine.      And moreover many self-revolving machines are to be met    with, but their motion is procured by a trick. They are    not connected with the subject under discussion. I have    been induced to mention the construction of these, merely    because they have been mentioned by former astronomers.       _Siddh[=a]nta Siroma[n.]i_, xi, 50-57, L. Wilkinson's        translation, revised by B[.a]p[.u] deva S(h)[.a]stri,        Calcutta, 1861.    Before proceeding to an investigation of the content of these texts it  is of considerable importance to establish dates for them, though there  are many difficulties in establishing any chronology for Hindu  astronomy. The _S[=u]rya Siddh[=a]nta_ is known to date, in its original  form, from the early Middle Ages, _ca._ 500. The section in question is  however quite evidently an interpolation from a later recension, most  probably that which established the complete text as it now stands; it  has been variously dated as _ca._ 1000 to _ca._ 1150 A.D. The date of  the _Siddh[=a]nta Siroma[n.]i_ is more certain for we know it was  written in about 1150 by Bh[=a]skara (born 1114). Thus both these  passages must have been written within a century of the great clock-tower  made by Su Sung. The technical details will lead us to suppose there is  more than a temporal connection.    We have already noted that the armillary spheres and celestial globes  described just before these extracts are more similar in design to  Chinese than to Ptolemaic practice. The mention of mercury and of sand  as alternatives to water for the clock's fluid is another feature very  prevalent in Chinese but absent in the Greek texts. Both texts seem  conscious of the complexity of these devices and there is a hint (it is  lost and revealed) that the story has been transmitted, only half  understood, from another age or culture. It should also be noted that  the mentions of cords and strings rather than gears, and the use of  spheres rather than planispheres would suggest we are dealing with  devices similar to the earliest Greek models rather than the later  devices, or with the Chinese practice.    A quite new and important note is injected by the passage from the  Bh[=a]skara text. Obviously intrusive in this astronomical text we have  the description of two \"perpetual motion wheels\" together with a third,  castigated by the author, which helps its perpetuity by letting water  flow from a reservoir by means of a syphon and drop into pots around the  circumference of the wheel. These seem to be the basis also, in the  extract from the _S[=u]rya Siddh[=a]nta_, of the \"wonder-causing  instrument\" to which mercury must be applied.    In the next sections we shall show that this idea of a perpetual motion  device occurs again in conjunction with astronomical models in Islam and  shortly afterwards in medieval Europe. At each occurrence, as here,  there are echoes of other cultures. In addition to those already  mentioned we find the otherwise mysterious \"peacock, man and monkey,\"  cited as parts of the jackwork of astronomical clocks of Islam,  associated with the weight drive so essential to the later horology in  Europe.    We have already seen that in classical times there were already two  different types of protoclocks; one, which may be termed  \"nonmathematical,\" designed only to give a visual aid in the conception  of the cosmos, the other, which may be termed \"mathematical\" in which  stereographic projection or gearing was employed to make the device a  quantitative rather than qualitative representation. These two lines  occur again in the Islamic culture area.    Nonmathematical protoclocks which are scarcely removed from the  classical forms appear continuously through the Byzantine era and in  Islam as soon as it recovered from the first shocks of its formation.  Procopius (died _ca._ 535) describes a monumental water clock which was  erected in Gaza _ca._ 500.[17] It contained impressive jackwork, such as  a Medusa head which rolled its eyes every hour on the hour, exhibiting  the time through lighted apertures and showing mythological  interpretations of the cosmos. All these effects were produced by  Heronic techniques, using hydraulic power and puppets moved by strings,  rather than with gearing.    Again in 807 a similarly marvelous exhibition clock made of bronze was  sent by Harun-al-Rashid to the Emperor Charlemagne; it seems to have  been of the same type, with automata and hydraulic works. For the  succeeding few centuries, Islam was in its Golden Age of development of  technical astronomy (_ca._ 950-1150) and attention may have been  concentrated on the more mathematical protoclocks. Towards the end of  the 12th century, however, there was a revival of the old tradition,  mainly at the court of the Emperor Saladin (1146-1173) when a great  automaton water clock, more magnificent than any hitherto, was erected  in Damascus. It was rebuilt, after 1168, by Mu[h.]ammad b. 'Al[=i] b.  Rustum, and repaired and improved by his son, Fakhr ad-d[=i]n  Ri[d.]w[=a]n b. Mu[h.]ammad,[18] who is most important as the author of  a book which describes in considerable technical detail the construction  of this and other protoclocks. Closely associated with his book one also  finds texts dealing with perpetual-motion devices, which we shall  consider later.    During the century following this horological exuberance in Damascus,  the center of gravity of Islamic astronomy shifted from the East to the  Hispano-Moorish West. At the same time there comes more evidence that  the line of mathematical protoclocks had not been left unattended. This  is suggested by a description given by Trithemius of another royal gift  from East to West which seems to have been different from the automata  and hydraulic devices of the tradition from Procopius to   Ri[d.]w[=a]n:[19]      In the same year [1232] the Saladin of Egypt sent by his    ambassadors as a gift to the emperor Frederic a valuable    machine of wonderful construction worth more than five    thousand ducats. For"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30003"],[0,"Law and Laughter (#5)"],[1," eccentricities formed the subject of much gossip in the Scottish  capital. To an English nobleman he declared: \"My brothers Harry and Tom  are certainly remarkable men, but they owe everything to me.\" Seeing a  look of surprise upon his friend's face he added: \"Yes, it is true; they  owe everything to me. On my father's death they pressed me for an annual  allowance. I knew this would have been their ruin, by relaxing their  industry. So making a sacrifice of my inclinations to gratify them I  refused to give them a farthing, and they have thriven ever  since--_owing everything to me_.\"    Henry, the second brother, was universally beloved and respected, and one  of the most popular advocates at the Scottish Bar. He was twice  Lord-Advocate for Scotland--on the second occasion under the Ministry of  \"All the Talents,\" when his younger brother was Lord Chancellor. He was  famous in the Parliament House and outside of it for his witticisms, a  selection of which will be given later.    Thomas, who became Lord Chancellor, obtained an unique influence while  practising at the Bar, and, like his older brother, he was a universal  favourite. \"Juries have declared,\" said Lord Brougham, \"that they have  felt it impossible to remove their looks from him when he had riveted,  and as it were fascinated, them by his first glance. Then hear his  voice, of surpassing sweetness, clear, flexible, strong, exquisitely  fitted to strains of serious earnestness.\" Yet although he did not rely  on wit, or humour, or sarcasm in addressing a jury, he could use them to  effect in cross-examination. \"You were born and bred in Manchester, I  perceive,\" he said to a witness. \"Yes.\"--\"I knew it,\" said Erskine  carelessly, \"from the absurd tie of your neckcloth.\" The witness'  presence of mind was gone, and he was made to unsay the greatest part of  his evidence in chief. Another witness confounding 'thick' whalebone  with 'long' whalebone, and unable to distinguish the difference after  counsel's explanation, Erskine exclaimed, \"Why, man, you do not seem to  know the difference between what is _thick_ or what is _long_! Now I  tell you the difference. You are _thick_-headed, and you are not  _long_-headed.\"    Lord Erskine's addiction to punning is well known, and many examples  might be cited. An action was brought against a stable-keeper for not  taking proper care of a horse. \"The horse,\" said counsel for the  plaintiff, \"was turned into the stable, with nothing to eat but musty  hay. To such the horse 'demurred.'\"--\"He should have 'gone to the  country,'\" at once retorted Lord Erskine. For the general reader it  should be explained that \"demurring\" and \"going to the country\" are  technical terms for requiring a cause to be decided on a question of law  by the judge, or on a question of fact by the jury. Here is another. A  low-class attorney who was much employed in bail-business and moving  attachments against the sheriff for not \"bringing in the body\"--that is,  not arresting and imprisoning a debtor, when such was the law--sold his  house in Lincoln's Inn Fields to the Corporation, of Surgeons to be used  as their Hall. \"I suppose it was recommended to them,\" said Erskine,  \"from the attorney being so well acquainted 'with the practice of  bringing in the body!'\"    Perhaps one of his smartest puns he relates himself. \"A case being laid  before me by my veteran friend, the Duke of Queensberry--better known as  'old Q'--as to whether he could sue a tradesman for breach of contract  about the painting of his house; and the evidence being totally  insufficient to support the case, I wrote thus: 'I am of opinion that  this action will not lie unless the witnesses do.'\"    He was also fond of a practical joke. In answer to a circular letter  from Sir John Sinclair, proposing that a testimonial should be presented  to himself for his eminent public services, Lord Erskine replied:         \"MY DEAR SIR JOHN,--I am certain there are few in this kingdom       who set a higher value on your public services than myself;       and I have the honour to subscribe\"--then, on turning over the       leaf, was to be found--\"myself, your most obedient faithful       servant,         \"ERSKINE.\"    \"Gentlemen of the jury,\" were his closing words after an impassioned  address, \"the reputation of a cheesemonger in the City of London is like  the bloom upon a peach. Breathe upon it, and it is gone for ever.\"    Among many apocryphal stories told of expedients by which smart counsel  have gained verdicts, this one respecting a case in which Mr. Justice  Gould was the judge and Erskine counsel for the defendant is least  likely of credit. The judge entertained a most unfavourable opinion of  the defendant's case, but being very old was scarcely audible, and  certainly unintelligible, to the jury. While he was summing up the case,  Erskine, sitting on the King's Counsel Bench, and full in the view of  the jury, nodded assent to the various remarks which fell from the  judge; and the jury, imagining that they had been directed to find for  the defendant, immediately did so.    When at the Bar, Erskine was always encouraged by the appreciation of  his brother barristers. On one occasion, when making an unusual exertion  on behalf of a client, he turned to Mr. Garrow, who was his colleague,  and not perceiving any sign of approbation on his countenance, he  whispered to him, \"Who do you think can get on with that d--d wet  blanket face of yours before him.\"    Nor did he always exhibit graciousness to older members. One nervous old  barrister named Lamb, who usually prefaced his pleadings with an  apology, said to Erskine one day that he felt more timid as he grew  older. \"No wonder,\" replied Erskine, \"the older the lamb the more  sheepish he grows.\"    When he was Lord Chancellor he was invited to attend the ministerial  fish dinner at Greenwich--known in later years as the Whitebait  Dinner--he replied: \"To be sure I will attend. What would your fish  dinner be without the Great Seal?\"           *       *       *       *       *    When a stupid jury returns an obviously wrong verdict the judge must  feel himself in an awkward position; but in such cases--if they ever  occur now--a good precedent has been set by Mr. Justice Maule who, when  in that predicament, addressed the prisoner in these terms:    \"Prisoner, your counsel thinks you innocent, the prosecution thinks you  innocent, and I think you innocent. But a jury of your own  fellow-countrymen, in the exercise of such common sense as they possess,  have found you guilty, and it remains that I should pass sentence upon  you. You will be imprisoned for one day, and as that day was yesterday,  you are free to go about your business.\"    \"May God strike me dead! my lord, if I did it,\" excitedly exclaimed a  prisoner who had been tried before the same justice for a serious  offence, and a verdict of \"guilty\" returned by the jury. The judge  looked grave, and paused an unusually long time before saying a word. At  last, amid breathless silence, he began: \"As Providence has not seen fit  to interpose in your case, it now becomes my duty to pronounce upon you  the sentence of the law,\" &c. When somewhat excited over a very bad case  tried before him he would delay sentence until he felt calmer, lest his  impulse or his temper should lead him astray. On one such occasion he  exclaimed, \"I can't pass sentence now. I might be too severe. I feel as  if I could give the man five-and-twenty years' penal servitude. Bring  him up to-morrow when I feel calmer.\"--\"Thank you, my lord,\" said the  prisoner, \"I know you will think better of it in the morning.\" Next  day the man appeared in the dock for sentence. \"Prisoner,\" said the  judge, \"I was angry yesterday, but I am calm to-day. I have spent a  night thinking of your awful deeds, and I find on inquiry I can sentence  you to penal servitude for life. I therefore pass upon you that  sentence. I have thought better of what I was inclined to do yesterday.\"    There are instances of brief summing up of a case by judges, but few in  the terms expressed by this worthy judge. \"If you believe the witnesses  for the plaintiff, you will find for the defendant; if you believe the  witnesses for the defendant, you will find for the plaintiff. If, like  myself, you don't believe any of them, Heaven knows which way you will  find. Consider your verdict.\"    To Mr. Justice Maule a witness said: \"You may believe me or not, but I  have stated not a word that is false, for I have been wedded to truth  from my infancy.\"--\"Yes, sir,\" said the judge dryly; \"but the question  is, _how long have you been a widower?_\"    In the good old days a learned counsel of ferocious mien and loud voice,  practising before him, received a fine rebuke from the justice. No reply  could be got from an elderly lady in the box, and the counsel appealed  to the judge. \"I really cannot answer,\" said the trembling lady. \"Why  not, ma'am?\" asked the judge. \"Because, my lord, he frightens me  so.\"--\"So he does me, ma'am,\" replied the judge.    He was as a rule patient and forbearing, and seldom interfered with  counsel in their mode of laying cases before a jury or the Bench, but  once he was fairly provoked to do so, by the confused blundering way in  which one of them was trying to instil a notion of what he meant into  the minds of the jury. \"I am sorry to interfere, Mr. ----,\" said the  judge, \"but do you not think that, by introducing a little order into  your narrative, you might possibly render yourself a trifle more  intelligible? It may be my fault that I cannot follow you--I know that  my brain is getting old and dilapidated; but I should like to stipulate  for some sort of order. There are plenty of them. There is the  chronological, the botanical, the metaphysical, the geographical--even  the alphabetical order would be better than no order at all.\"           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
