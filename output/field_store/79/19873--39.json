So he sent me here  to fetch them.\"    The Fate laughed. \"Dede-Vsevede indeed! Why, I am his mother, it is  the shining sun himself. He is a child at morning time, a grown man at  midday, a decrepit old man, looking as if he had lived a hundred  years, at eventide. But I will see that you have the three hairs from  his head; I am not your godmother for nothing. All the same you must  not remain here. My son is a good lad, but when he comes home he is  hungry, and would very probably order you to be roasted for his  supper. Now I will turn this empty bucket upside down, and you shall  hide underneath it.\"    Plavacek begged the Fate to obtain from Dede-Vsevede the answers to  the three questions he had been asked.    \"I will do so certainly, but you must listen to what he says.\"    Suddenly a blast of wind howled round the palace, and the Sun entered  by a western window. He was an old man with golden hair.    \"I smell human flesh,\" cried he, \"I am sure of it. Mother, you have  some one here.\"    \"Star of day,\" she replied, \"whom could I have here that you would not  see sooner than I? The fact is that in your daily journeys the scent  of human flesh is always with you, so when you come home at evening it  clings to you still.\"    The old man said nothing, and sat down to supper. When he had finished  he laid his golden head on the Fate's lap and went to sleep. Then she  pulled out a hair and threw it on the ground. It fell with a metallic  sound like the vibration of a guitar string.    \"What do you want, mother?\" asked he.    \"Nothing, my son; I was sleeping, and had a strange dream.\"    \"What was it, mother?\"    \"I thought I was in a place where there was a well, and the well was  fed from a spring, the water of which cured all diseases. Even the  dying were restored to health on drinking that water, and the dead who  were sprinkled with it came to life again. For the last twenty years  the well has run dry. What must be done to restore the flow of water?\"    \"That is very simple. A frog has lodged itself in the opening of the  spring, this prevents the flow of water. Kill the frog, and the water  will return to the well.\"    He slept again, and the old woman pulled out another golden hair, and  threw it on the ground.    \"Mother, what do you want?\"    \"Nothing, my son, nothing; I was dreaming. In my dream I saw a large  town, the name of which I have forgotten. And there grew an apple-tree  the fruit of which had the power to make the old young again. A single  apple eaten by an old man would restore to him the vigour and  freshness of youth. For twenty years this tree has not borne fruit.  What can be done to make it fruitful?\"    \"The means are not difficult. A snake hidden among the roots destroys  the sap. Kill the snake, transplant the tree, and the fruit will grow  as before.\"    [Illustration]    He again fell asleep, and the old woman pulled out another golden  hair.    \"Now look here, mother, why will you not let me sleep?\" said the old  man, really vexed; and he would have got up.    \"Lie down, my darling son, do not disturb yourself. I am sorry I awoke  you, but I have had a very strange dream. It seemed that I saw a  boatman on the shores of the Black Sea, and he complained that he had  been toiling at the ferry for twenty years without any one having come  to take his place. For how much longer must this poor old man continue  to row?\"    \"He is a silly fellow. He has but to place his oars in the hands of  the first comer and jump ashore. Whoever receives the oars will  replace him as ferryman. But leave me in peace now, mother, and do not  wake me again. I have to rise very early, and must first dry the eyes  of a princess. The poor thing spends all night weeping for her husband  who has been sent by the king to get three of my golden hairs.\"    Next morning the wind whistled round Dede-Vsevede's palace, and  instead of an old man, a beautiful child with golden hair awoke on the  old woman's lap. It was the glorious sun. He bade her good-bye, and  flew out of the eastern window. The old woman turned up the bucket and  said to Plavacek, \"Look, here are the three golden hairs. You now know  the answers to your questions. May God direct you and send you a  prosperous journey. You will not see me again, for you will have no  further need of me.\"    He thanked her gratefully and left her. On arriving at the town with  the dried-up well, he was questioned by the king as to what news he  had brought.    \"Have the well carefully cleaned out,\" said he, \"kill the frog that  obstructs the spring, and the wonderful water will flow again.\"    The king did as he was advised, and rejoiced to see the water return.  He gave Plavacek twelve swan-white horses, and as much gold and silver  as they could carry.    On reaching the second town and being asked by the king what news he  had brought, he replied, \"Excellent; one could not wish for better.  Dig up your apple-tree, kill the snake that lies among the roots,  transplant the tree, and it will produce apples like those of former  times.\"    And all turned out as he had said, for no sooner was the tree  replanted than it was covered with blossoms that gave it the  appearance of a sea of roses. The delighted king gave him twelve  raven-black horses, laden with as much wealth as they could carry. He  then journeyed to the shores of the Black Sea. There the boatman  questioned him as to what news he had brought respecting his release.  Plavacek first crossed with his twenty-four horses to the opposite  bank, and then replied that the boatman might gain his freedom by  placing the oars in the hands of the first traveller who wished to be  ferried over.    Plavacek's royal father-in-law could not believe his eyes when he saw  Dede-Vsevede's three golden hairs. As for the princess, his young  wife, she wept tears, but of joy, not sadness, to see her dear one  again, and she said to him, \"How did you get such splendid horses and  so much wealth, dear husband?\"    And he answered her, \"All this represents the price paid for the  weariness of spirit I have felt; it is the ready money for hardships  endured and services given. Thus, I showed one king how to regain  possession of the Apples of Youth: to another I told the secret of  reopening the spring of water that gives health and life.\"    \"Apples of Youth! Water of Life!\" interrupted the king. \"I will  certainly go and find these treasures for myself. Ah, what joy! having  eaten of these apples I shall become young again; having drunk of the  Water of Immortality, I shall live for ever.\"    And he started off in search of these treasures. But he has not yet  returned from his search.          KOVLAD        I. THE SOVEREIGN OF THE MINERAL KINGDOM     II. THE LOST CHILD          [Illustration]    I    THE SOVEREIGN OF THE MINERAL KINGDOM      Once upon a time, and a long long time ago it was, there lived a widow  who had a very pretty daughter. The mother, good honest woman, was  quite content with her station in life. But with the daughter it was  otherwise; she, like a spoilt beauty, looked contemptuously upon her  many admirers, her mind was full of proud and ambitious thoughts, and  the more lovers she had, the prouder she became.    One beautiful moonlight night the mother awoke, and being unable to  sleep, began to pray God for the happiness of her only child, though  she often made her mother's life miserable. The fond woman looked  lovingly at the beautiful daughter sleeping by her side, and she  wondered, as she saw her smile, what happy dream had visited her. Then  she finished her prayer, and laying her head on the girl's pillow,  fell asleep. Next day she said, \"Come, darling child, tell me what you  were dreaming about last night, you looked so happy smiling in your  sleep.\"    \"Oh yes, mother, I remember. I had a very beautiful dream. I thought a  rich nobleman came to our house, in a splendid carriage of brass, and  gave me a ring set with stones, that sparkled like the stars of  heaven. When I entered the church with him, it was full of people, and  they all thought me divine and adorable, like the Blessed Virgin.\"    \"Ah! my child, what sin! May God keep you from such dreams.\"    But the daughter ran away singing, and busied herself about the house.  The same day a handsome young farmer drove into the village in his  cart and begged them to come and share his country bread. He was a  kind fellow, and the mother liked him much. But the daughter refused  his invitation, and insulted him into the bargain.    \"Even if you had driven in a carriage of brass,\" she said, \"and had  offered me a ring set with stones shining as the stars in heaven, I  would never have married you--you, a mere peasant!\"    The young farmer was terribly upset at her words, and with a prayer  for her soul, returned home a saddened man. But her mother scolded and  reproached her.    The next night the woman again awoke, and taking her rosary prayed  with still greater fervour, that God would bless her child. This time  the girl laughed as she slept.    \"What can the poor child be dreaming about?\" she said to herself: and  sighing she prayed for her again. Then she laid her head upon her  pillow and tried in vain to sleep. In the morning, when her daughter  was dressing, she said: \"Well, my dear, you were dreaming again last  night, and laughing like a maniac.\"    \"Was I? Listen, I dreamt a nobleman came for me in a silver carriage,  and gave me a golden diadem. When I entered the church with him, the  people admired "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#5)"],[1,"shepherd-dog when  he is first brought in contact with a flock. It is easy to see that he  has an amazingly keen interest in the sheep. He regards them with an  attention which he gives to no other living things, except perhaps his  master. Out of a litter of well-bred pups belonging to this variety, the  greater part will at once assume a curatorial attitude toward a flock.  They will show a disposition to keep them together, and will seize on  an individual only in case he undertakes to break away. They will  generally use no more force than is necessary to reduce the recalcitrant  to order. They arrest him by catching hold of the leg or fleece, and  rarely seize hold of the throat, which other dogs, led by their  inherited instincts, are apt at once to assail. Very rarely does a  shepherd-dog of good ancestry, even at the outset of his career, attack  a sheep in a way which shows that the ancient proclivities have been  revived in his spirit. Even then a little remonstrance, or at most a  slight castigation, is pretty sure to turn him from his evil ways. If we  could measure in some visible manner the psychic peculiarities of  animals, we would be led to regard this great change in the instincts of  the dog, which has been brought about by his use in herding, as perhaps  the most momentous transformation which man has ever accomplished in any  creature, including himself; for none of our own inherited savage traits  are so completely sublated at the time of our birth as is this old and  sometime dominant slaying motive in the shepherd-dog.    With the advancing differentiation of human occupations and amusements,  our breeds of dogs have, by more or less deliberate selection, been  developed until by form and instincts they fit a great variety of  purposes. Some of these pertain to industrial work, but the greater  portion are related to the sports or fancies of men. The turnspit was  bred for its short legs and small, compact body, and was serviceable in  those treadmills of the hearth which have long since passed out of use,  but which were for centuries features in our kitchens.    [Illustration: Bull-Dog]    The massive type of bull-dogs, characterized by heavy frames and an  indomitable will, appears to have been brought about by a process of  selection having for its unconscious end the development of a breed  which should render the herdsman of horned cattle something like the  assistance which the shepherd-dog gave to those who had charge of  flocks. In the more primitive state of our bulls and cows the  creatures were much wilder than at present, and were generally kept,  not in enclosed pastures, but on unfenced ranges. In these conditions  the care taken needed the help which the ancestors of our modern  bull-dog afforded. The tasks which the animal was called on to perform  were of a ruder nature than those which were allotted to the  shepherd-dog. Their business was to conquer the unruly beast. They  were taught to seize the muzzle, and by the pain they thus inflicted  they could subdue even the fiercer small bulls of the ancient type of  form. From this original use the cattle-dogs were turned to the brutal  sport of bull-baiting, a rude diversion which was indulged in by our  ancestors for centuries, and has only disappeared in our less cruel  modern days. Bred for the bull-ring, these dogs acquired the  formidable strength and ferocity under excitement which made their  name a terror and their qualities a satirical embodiment of the ruder  traits which characterized the British folk.    The training which instituted the breed of bull-dogs was evidently  much less continuous and effective than that which developed the  shepherding variety. The use for the creature in the care of herds has  passed away. In the older parts of the world cattle are kept only in  enclosures; and where, as on our frontier, they still range over  unbounded fields, they are guarded by horsemen who do not need the  assistance of dogs to control the movements of the herds. No longer  serviceable either in economies or sports, the breed of true bull-dogs  is rapidly disappearing. As we may often observe in other fields of  development, the peculiarities of this breed are now under the control  of fancy, and the blood is being led far away from its old  characteristics. The bull-terrier and other varieties, which retain  something of the form and of the solemn demeanor which characterized  their ancestors, but which are too small to assail horned cattle, mark  the vanishing stages of this great stock, which will soon be known  only in memory. The history of this peculiar herd-dog shows us how  marvellously pliant the body and mind of this species has become under  the conditions of civilization. The rude process of unconscious  selection, acting without steadfastness of purpose or rationally  developed skill, serves to sway the qualities of the animal this way  or that to meet the ever-changing requirements of use or fancy. A  similar selection in the case of our horned cattle has within a few  centuries converted the cows into mild-mannered and sedentary  milk-making machines, and has deprived the bulls of the greater part  of their ancient savage humor. Owing to this change in the quality of  their associates in captivity the dogs have also been led into great  variations. The same type of interaction may be traced again and again  in the isolated part of the world enclosed within our fences, as well  as in the free realm of the wildernesses. All the individuals in the  great host of life affect each other as do the soldiers of a  well-organized army in the movements of a battle.    The shepherd-dog, the turnspit, and the bull-dog are the three  remarkable variations of the canine blood which were brought about by  a process of training and selection unconsciously directed to the  institution of breeds suited to special economic ends. The other  varieties of dogs have been shaped more distinctly for purposes of  amusement or for the indulgence of mere fancy. The several varieties  of hounds, harriers, beagles, pointers, setters, terriers, etc., have  been designed to meet a dozen or more variations in the conditions of  the chase. The marvellously complete way in which special  peculiarities have been developed in mind and body makes this field of  domestic culture the most fascinating subject of inquiry to the  naturalist. The ordinary fox-hound has had his inheritances determined  so as to fit him for pursuing a small animal which can rarely be kept  in view during its flight, and which can only be followed by the odor  it leaves in its trail, so these creatures run almost altogether under  guidance of their sense of smell. The stag-hound, on the other hand,  pursues a relatively large animal which cannot well be followed by the  nose, at least with any speed; they therefore trust almost altogether  to vision in their chase. The packs which hunt otters have developed  the swimming habit and an array of instincts which fit them  especially for this peculiar sport. If space allowed we could note at  least a dozen divisions of the group of hounds or chasing dogs, each  of which has developed a peculiar assemblage of qualities, more or  less precisely adapted to some particular game.    [Illustration: Fox-Hound and Pups]    Perhaps the most special adaption which man has brought about in his  domesticated animals is found in our pointers and setters. In these  groups the dogs have been taught, in somewhat diverse ways, to  indicate the presence of birds to the gunner. Although the modes of  action of these two breeds are closely related, they are sufficiently  distinct to meet certain differences of circumstances. The  peculiarities of their actions, it should be noted, are altogether  related to the qualities of our fowling-pieces. These have been in  use, at least in the form where shot took the place of the single  ball, for less than two centuries, and the peculiar training of our  pointers and setters has been brought about in even less time. It  seems likely, indeed, that it is the result of about a hundred and  fifty years of teaching, combined with the selection which so  effectively works upon all our domesticated creatures. It thus appears  that this peculiar impress upon the habits of the hunting-dog is the  result of somewhere near thirty generations of culture.    [Illustration: Pointer Retrieving a Fallen Bird]    Although, as has been often suggested, the pointing or setting habit  probably rests upon an original custom of pausing for a moment before  leaping upon their prey, which was possibly characteristic of the wild  dog, it seems to me unlikely that this is the case, for we do not find  this habit of creeping on the prey among our more primitive forms of  dogs nor the wild allied species as a marked feature. All the canine  animals trust rather to furious chase than to the cautious form of  assault by stealthy approach and a final spring upon their prey, as is  the habit with the cat tribe. Granting this somewhat doubtful claim that  the induced habits of these dogs which have been specially adapted to  the fowling-piece rest upon an original and native instinct, the amount  of specialization which has been attained in about thirty generations of  care remains a very surprising feature, and affords one of the most  instructive lessons as to the possibilities of animal culture.    [Illustration: Pointer and Setter, Flushing Game]    It is an interesting fact that the variation of a spontaneous sort,  which is now taking place in our pointers and setters, is  considerable. It is, perhaps, more distinctly indicated here than in  any other of the breeds which are characterized by peculiar  qualities of mind. All those familiar with the behavior of these  strains of dogs have observed the high measure of individuality  which characterizes them. I have recently been informed by a friend,  who is a hunter "]]]
