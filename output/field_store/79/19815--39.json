[3] The influence of environment and heredity on human evolution in  general and on the history of the East in particular, though of great  importance, cannot be treated in a summary such as this. The influence  of climatic and other environmental factors has been ably treated by  Prof. Ellsworth Huntington in his various works, such as _The Pulse of  Asia_ (Boston, 1907); _Civilization and Climate_ (Yale Univ. Press,  1915), and _World-Power and Evolution_ (Yale Univ. Press, 1919). See  also Chap. III. in Arminius Vambery--_Der Islam im neunzehnten  Jahrhundert.

CHAPTER I    THE MOHAMMEDAN REVIVAL      By the eighteenth century the Moslem world had sunk to the lowest depth  of its decrepitude. Nowhere were there any signs of healthy vigour,  everywhere were stagnation and decay. Manners and morals were alike  execrable. The last vestiges of Saracenic culture had vanished in a  barbarous luxury of the few and an equally barbarous degradation of the  multitude. Learning was virtually dead, the few universities which  survived fallen into dreary decay and languishing in poverty and  neglect. Government had become despotism tempered by anarchy and  assassination. Here and there a major despot like the Sultan of Turkey  or the Indian \"Great Mogul\" maintained some semblance of state  authority, albeit provincial pashas were for ever striving to erect  independent governments based, like their masters', on tyranny and  extortion. The pashas, in turn, strove ceaselessly against unruly local  chiefs and swarms of brigands who infested the countryside. Beneath this  sinister hierarchy groaned the people, robbed, bullied, and ground into  the dust. Peasant and townsman had alike lost all incentive to labour or  initiative, and both agriculture and trade had fallen to the lowest  level compatible with bare survival.    As for religion, it was as decadent as everything else. The austere  monotheism of Mohammed had become overlaid with a rank growth of  superstition and puerile mysticism. The mosques stood unfrequented and  ruinous, deserted by the ignorant multitude, which, decked out in  amulets, charms, and rosaries, listened to squalid fakirs or ecstatic  dervishes, and went on pilgrimages to the tombs of \"holy men,\"  worshipped as saints and \"intercessors\" with that Allah who had become  too remote a being for the direct devotion of these benighted souls. As  for the moral precepts of the Koran, they were ignored or defied.  Wine-drinking and opium-eating were well-nigh universal, prostitution  was rampant, and the most degrading vices flaunted naked and unashamed.  Even the holy cities, Mecca and Medina, were sink-holes of iniquity,  while the \"Hajj,\" or pilgrimage ordained by the Prophet, had become a  scandal through its abuses. In fine: the life had apparently gone out of  Islam, leaving naught but a dry husk of soulless ritual and degrading  superstition behind. Could Mohammed have returned to earth, he would  unquestionably have anathematized his followers as apostates and  idolaters.    Yet, in this darkest hour, a voice came crying out of the vast Arabian  desert, the cradle of Islam, calling the faithful back to the true path.  This puritan reformer, the famous Abd-el-Wahab, kindled a fire which  presently spread to the remotest corners of the Moslem world, purging  Islam of its sloth and reviving the fervour of olden days. The great  Mohammedan Revival had begun.    Mahommed ibn Abd-el-Wahab was born about the year A.D. 1700 in the heart  of the Arabian desert, the region known as the Nejd. The Nejd was the  one clean spot in the decadent Moslem world. We have already seen how,  with the transformation of the caliphate from a theocratic democracy to  an Oriental despotism, the free-spirited Arabs had returned scornfully  to their deserts. Here they had maintained their wild freedom. Neither  caliph nor sultan dared venture far into those vast solitudes of burning  sand and choking thirst, where the rash invader was lured to sudden  death in a whirl of stabbing spears. The Arabs recognized no master,  wandering at will with their flocks and camels, or settled here and  there in green oases hidden in the desert's heart. And in the desert  they retained their primitive political and religious virtues. The  nomad Bedouin lived under the sway of patriarchal \"sheiks\"; the settled  dwellers in the oases usually acknowledged the authority of some leading  family. But these rulers possessed the slenderest authority, narrowly  circumscribed by well-established custom and a jealous public opinion  which they transgressed at their peril. The Turks, to be sure, had  managed to acquire a precarious authority over the holy cities and the  Red Sea littoral, but the Nejd, the vast interior, was free. And, in  religion, as in politics, the desert Arabs kept the faith of their  fathers. Scornfully rejecting the corruptions of decadent Islam, they  held fast to the simple theology of primitive Islam, so congenial to  their Arab natures.    Into this atmosphere of an older and better age, Abd-el-Wahab was born.  Displaying from the first a studious and religious bent, he soon  acquired a reputation for learning and sanctity. Making the Meccan  pilgrimage while still a young man, he studied at Medina and travelled  as far as Persia, returning ultimately to the Nejd. He returned burning  with holy wrath at what he had seen, and determined to preach a puritan  reformation. For years he wandered up and down Arabia, and at last he  converted Mahommed, head of the great clan of Saud, the most powerful  chieftain in all the Nejd. This gave Abd-el-Wahab both moral prestige  and material strength, and he made the most of his opportunities.  Gradually, the desert Arabs were welded into a politico-religious unity  like that effected by the Prophet. Abd-el-Wahab was, in truth, a  faithful counterpart of the first caliphs, Abu Bekr and Omar. When he  died in 1787 his disciple, Saud, proved a worthy successor. The new  Wahabi state was a close counterpart of the Meccan caliphate. Though  possessing great military power, Saud always considered himself  responsible to public opinion and never encroached upon the legitimate  freedom of his subjects. Government, though stern, was able and just.  The Wahabi judges were competent and honest. Robbery, became almost  unknown, so well was the public peace maintained. Education was  sedulously fostered. Every oasis had its school, while teachers were  sent to the Bedouin tribes.    Having consolidated the Nejd, Saud was now ready to undertake the  greater task of subduing and purifying the Moslem world. His first  objective was of course the holy cities. This objective was attained in  the opening years of the nineteenth century. Nothing could stand against  the rush of the Wahabi hosts burning with fanatic hatred against the  Turks, who were loathed both as apostate Moslems and as usurpers of that  supremacy in Islam which all Arabs believed should rest in Arab hands.  When Saud died in 1814 he was preparing to invade Syria. It looked for a  moment as though the Wahabis were to sweep the East and puritanize all  Islam at a blow.    But it was not to be. Unable to stem the Wahabi flood, the Sultan of  Turkey called on his powerful vassal, the famous Mehemet Ali. This able  Albanian adventurer had by that time made himself master of Egypt.  Frankly recognizing the superiority of the West, he had called in  numerous European officers who rapidly fashioned a formidable army,  composed largely of hard-fighting Albanian highlanders, and disciplined  and equipped after European models. Mehemet Ali gladly answered the  Sultan's summons, and it soon became clear that even Wahabi fanaticism  was no match for European muskets and artillery handled by seasoned  veterans. In a short time the holy cities were recaptured and the  Wahabis were driven back into the desert. The nascent Wahabi empire had  vanished like a mirage. Wahabism's political role was ended.[5]    However, Wahabism's spiritual role had only just begun. The Nejd  remained a focus of puritan zeal whence the new spirit radiated in all  directions. Even in the holy cities Wahabism continued to set the  religious tone, and the numberless \"Hajjis,\" or pilgrims, who came  annually from every part of the Moslem world returned to their homes  zealous reformers. Soon the Wahabi leaven began to produce profound  disturbances in the most distant quarters. For example, in northern  India a Wahabi fanatic, Seyid Ahmed,[6] so roused the Punjabi  Mohammedans that he actually built up a theocratic state, and only his  chance death prevented a possible Wahabi conquest of northern India.  This state was shattered by the Sikhs, about 1830, but when the English  conquered the country they had infinite trouble with the smouldering  embers of Wahabi feeling, which, in fact, lived on, contributed to the  Indian mutiny, and permanently fanaticized Afghanistan and the wild  tribes of the Indian North-West Frontier.[7] It was during these years  that the famous Seyid Mahommed ben Sennussi came from his Algerian home  to Mecca and there imbibed those Wahabi principles which led to the  founding of the great Pan-Islamic fraternity that bears his name. Even  the Babbist movement in Persia, far removed though it was doctrinally  from Wahabi teaching, was indubitably a secondary reflex of the Wahabi  urge.[8] In fact, within a generation, the strictly Wahabi movement had  broadened into the larger development known as the Mohammedan Revival,  and this in turn was developing numerous "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2412"],[0,"The Categories (#5)"],[1,"ces. With regard to primary substances, it  is quite true that there is no such possibility, for neither wholes nor  parts of primary substances are relative. The individual man or ox is  not defined with reference to something external. Similarly with the  parts: a particular hand or head is not defined as a particular hand or  head of a particular person, but as the hand or head of a particular  person. It is true also, for the most part at least, in the case of  secondary substances; the species 'man' and the species 'ox' are not  defined with reference to anything outside themselves. Wood, again, is  only relative in so far as it is some one's property, not in so far as  it is wood. It is plain, then, that in the cases mentioned substance is  not relative. But with regard to some secondary substances there is a  difference of opinion; thus, such terms as 'head' and 'hand' are  defined with reference to that of which the things indicated are a  part, and so it comes about that these appear to have a relative  character. Indeed, if our definition of that which is relative was  complete, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove that no  substance is relative. If, however, our definition was not complete, if  those things only are properly called relative in the case of which  relation to an external object is a necessary condition of existence,  perhaps some explanation of the dilemma may be found.    The former definition does indeed apply to all relatives, but the fact  that a thing is explained with reference to something else does not  make it essentially relative.    From this it is plain that, if a man definitely apprehends a relative  thing, he will also definitely apprehend that to which it is relative.  Indeed this is self-evident: for if a man knows that some particular  thing is relative, assuming that we call that a relative in the case of  which relation to something is a necessary condition of existence, he  knows that also to which it is related. For if he does not know at all  that to which it is related, he will not know whether or not it is  relative. This is clear, moreover, in particular instances. If a man  knows definitely that such and such a thing is 'double', he will also  forthwith know definitely that of which it is the double. For if there  is nothing definite of which he knows it to be the double, he does not  know at all that it is double. Again, if he knows that a thing is more  beautiful, it follows necessarily that he will forthwith definitely  know that also than which it is more beautiful. He will not merely know  indefinitely that it is more beautiful than something which is less  beautiful, for this would be supposition, not knowledge. For if he does  not know definitely that than which it is more beautiful, he can no  longer claim to know definitely that it is more beautiful than  something else which is less beautiful: for it might be that nothing  was less beautiful. It is, therefore, evident that if a man apprehends  some relative thing definitely, he necessarily knows that also  definitely to which it is related.    Now the head, the hand, and such things are substances, and it is  possible to know their essential character definitely, but it does not  necessarily follow that we should know that to which they are related.  It is not possible to know forthwith whose head or hand is meant. Thus  these are not relatives, and, this being the case, it would be true to  say that no substance is relative in character. It is perhaps a  difficult matter, in such cases, to make a positive statement without  more exhaustive examination, but to have raised questions with regard  to details is not without advantage.        Part 8    By 'quality' I mean that in virtue of which people are said to be such  and such.    Quality is a term that is used in many senses. One sort of quality let  us call 'habit' or 'disposition'. Habit differs from disposition in  being more lasting and more firmly established. The various kinds of  knowledge and of virtue are habits, for knowledge, even when acquired  only in a moderate degree, is, it is agreed, abiding in its character  and difficult to displace, unless some great mental upheaval takes  place, through disease or any such cause. The virtues, also, such as  justice, self-restraint, and so on, are not easily dislodged or  dismissed, so as to give place to vice.    By a disposition, on the other hand, we mean a condition that is easily  changed and quickly gives place to its opposite. Thus, heat, cold,  disease, health, and so on are dispositions. For a man is disposed in  one way or another with reference to these, but quickly changes,  becoming cold instead of warm, ill instead of well. So it is with all  other dispositions also, unless through lapse of time a disposition has  itself become inveterate and almost impossible to dislodge: in which  case we should perhaps go so far as to call it a habit.    It is evident that men incline to call those conditions habits which  are of a more or less permanent type and difficult to displace; for  those who are not retentive of knowledge, but volatile, are not said to  have such and such a 'habit' as regards knowledge, yet they are  disposed, we may say, either better or worse, towards knowledge. Thus  habit differs from disposition in this, that while the latter in  ephemeral, the former is permanent and difficult to alter.    Habits are at the same time dispositions, but dispositions are not  necessarily habits. For those who have some specific habit may be said  also, in virtue of that habit, to be thus or thus disposed; but those  who are disposed in some specific way have not in all cases the  corresponding habit.    Another sort of quality is that in virtue of which, for example, we  call men good boxers or runners, or healthy or sickly: in fact it  includes all those terms which refer to inborn capacity or incapacity.  Such things are not predicated of a person in virtue of his  disposition, but in virtue of his inborn capacity or incapacity to do  something with ease or to avoid defeat of any kind. Persons are called  good boxers or good runners, not in virtue of such and such a  disposition, but in virtue of an inborn capacity to accomplish  something with ease. Men are called healthy in virtue of the inborn  capacity of easy resistance to those unhealthy influences that may  ordinarily arise; unhealthy, in virtue of the lack of this capacity.  Similarly with regard to softness and hardness. Hardness is predicated  of a thing because it has that capacity of resistance which enables it  to withstand disintegration; softness, again, is predicated of a thing  by reason of the lack of that capacity.    A third class within this category is that of affective qualities and  affections. Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples of this sort  of quality, together with all that is akin to these; heat, moreover,  and cold, whiteness, and blackness are affective qualities. It is  evident that these are qualities, for those things that possess them  are themselves said to be such and such by reason of their presence.  Honey is called sweet because it contains sweetness; the body is called  white because it contains whiteness; and so in all other cases.    The term 'affective quality' is not used as indicating that those  things which admit these qualities are affected in any way. Honey is  not called sweet because it is affected in a specific way, nor is this  what is meant in any other instance. Similarly heat and cold are called  affective qualities, not because those things which admit them are  affected. What is meant is that these said qualities are capable of  producing an 'affection' in the way of perception. For sweetness has  the power of affecting the sense of taste; heat, that of touch; and so  it is with the rest of these qualities.    Whiteness and blackness, however, and the other colours, are not said  to be affective qualities in this sense, but because they themselves  are the results of an affection. It is plain that many changes of  colour take place because of affections. When a man is ashamed, he  blushes; when he is afraid, he becomes pale, and so on. So true is  this, that when a man is by nature liable to such affections, arising  from some concomitance of elements in his constitution, it is a  probable inference that he has the corresponding complexion of skin.  For the same disposition of bodily elements, which in the former  instance was momentarily present in the case of an access of shame,  might be a result of a man's natural temperament, so as to produce the  corresponding colouring also as a natural characteristic. All  conditions, therefore, of this kind, if caused by certain permanent and  lasting affections, are called affective qualities. For pallor and  duskiness of complexion are called qualities, inasmuch as we are said  to be such and such in virtue of them, not only if they originate in  natural constitution, but also if they come about through long disease  or sunburn, and are difficult to remove, or indeed remain throughout  life. For in the same way we are said to be such and such because of  these.    Those conditions, however, which arise from causes which may easily be  rendered ineffective or speedily removed, are called, not qualities,  but affections: for we are not said to be such in virtue of them. The man  who blushes through shame is not said to be a constitutional blusher,  nor is the man who becomes pale through fear said to be  constitutionally pale. He is said rather to have been affected.    Thus such conditions are called affections, not qualities. In like  manner there are affective qualities and affections of the soul. That  temper with which a man is born and which has its origin in certain  deep-seated affections is called a quality. I mean such conditions as  insanity, irascibility, and so on: for people are said to be mad "]]]
