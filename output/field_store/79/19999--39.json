They do  not stay long after November, and return again in April.    The nest of this Kinglet is rarely seen. It is of matted hair, feathers,  moss, etc., bulky, round, and partly hanging. Until recently the eggs  were unknown. They are of a dirty cream-white, deepening at larger end  to form a ring, some specimens being spotted.    Mr. Nehrling, who has heard this Kinglet sing in central Wisconsin  and northern Illinois, speaks of the \"power, purity, and volume of  the notes, their faultless modulation and long continuance,\" and  Dr. Elliott Coues says of it: \"The Kinglet's exquisite vocalization  defies description.\" Dr. Brewer says that its song is clear, resonant,  and high, a prolonged series, varying from the lowest tones to the  highest, and terminating with the latter. It may be heard at quite a  distance, and in some respects bears more resemblance to the song of  the English Sky-lark than to that of the Canary, to which Mr. Audubon  compares it.

DEAR YOUNG BIRD LOVERS:    Most every person thinks that, while my actions are very pretty and  attractive, and speak much in my favor, I can only really say, _Coo-o,  Coo-o_, which they also think does not mean anything at all. Well, I  just thought I would undeceive them by writing you a letter. Many grown  up people fancy that we birds cannot express ourselves because we don't  know very much. Of course, there is a good reason why they have this  poor opinion of us. They are so busy with their own private concerns  that they forget that there are little creatures like ourselves in the  world who, if they would take a little time to become acquainted with  them, would fill their few hours of leisure with a sweeter recreation  than they find in many of their chosen outings. A great English poet,  whose writings you will read when you get older, said you should look  through Nature up to Nature's God. What did he mean? I think he had us  birds in his mind, for it is through a study of our habits, more perhaps  than that of the voiceless trees or the dumb four-footed creatures  that roam the fields, that your hearts are opened to see and admire  real beauty. We birds are the true teachers of faith, hope, and  charity,--faith, because we trust one another; hope, because, even when  our mother Nature seems unkind, sending the drifting snow and the bitter  blasts of winter, we sing a song of summer time; and charity, because we  are never fault finders.    I believe, without knowing it, I have been telling you about myself and  my mate. We Doves are very sincere, and every one says we are constant.    If you live in the country, children, you must often hear our voices. We  are so tender and fond of each other that we are looked upon as models  for children, and even grown-up folks. My mate does not build a very  nice nest--only uses a few sticks to keep the eggs from falling out--but  she is a good mother and nurses the little ones very tenderly. Some  people are so kind that they build for us a dove cote, supply us with  wheat and corn, and make our lives as free from care and danger as they  can. Come and see us some day, and then you can tell whether my picture  is a good one. The artist thinks it is and he certainly took lots of  pains with it.    Now, if you will be kind to all birds, you will find me, in name only,                                                            MOURNING DOVE.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  MOURNING DOVE.                  Copyrighted by Nature Study Pub. Co., 1897, Chicago.]          HOW THE BIRDS SECURED THEIR RIGHTS.         Deuteronomy xxxii 6-7.--\"If a bird's nest chance to be before       thee in the way, in any tree, or on the ground, young ones or       eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs,       thou shalt not take the dam with the young. But thou shalt in       anywise let the dam go, that it may be well with thee, and that       thou may prolong thy days.\"      It is said that the following petition was instrumental in securing the  adoption in Massachusetts of a law prohibiting the wearing of song and  insectivorous birds on women's hats. It is stated that the interesting  document was prepared by United States Senator Hoar. The foregoing verse  of Scripture might have been quoted by the petitioning birds to  strengthen their position before the lawmakers:    \"TO THE GREAT AND GENERAL COURT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS:  We, the song birds of Massachusetts and their playfellows, make this our  humble petition. We know more about you than you think we do. We know  how good you are. We have hopped about the roofs and looked in at the  windows of the houses you have built for poor and sick and hungry  people, and little lame and deaf and blind children. We have built our  nests in the trees and sung many a song as we flew about the gardens and  parks you have made so beautiful for your children, especially your poor  children, to play in. Every year we fly a great way over the country,  keeping all the time where the sun is bright and warm. And we know that  whenever you do anything the other people all over this great land  between the seas and the great lakes find it out, and pretty soon will  try to do the same. We know. We know.    \"We are Americans just the same as you are. Some of us, like some of  you, came across the great sea. But most of the birds like us have lived  here a long while; and the birds like us welcomed your fathers when they  came here many, many years ago. Our fathers and mothers have always  done their best to please your fathers and mothers.    \"Now we have a sad story to tell you. Thoughtless or bad people are  trying to destroy us. They kill us because our feathers are beautiful.  Even pretty and sweet girls, who we should think would be our best  friends, kill our brothers and children so that they may wear our  plumage on their hats. Sometimes people kill us for mere wantonness.  Cruel boys destroy our nests and steal our eggs and our young ones.  People with guns and snares lie in wait to kill us; as if the place for  a bird were not in the sky, alive, but in a shop window or in a glass  case. If this goes on much longer all our song birds will be gone.  Already we are told in some other countries that used to be full of  birds they are now almost gone. Even the Nightingales are being killed  in Italy.    \"Now we humbly pray that you will stop all this and will save us from  this sad fate. You have already made a law that no one shall kill a  harmless song bird or destroy our nests or our eggs. Will you please  make another one that no one shall wear our feathers, so that no one  shall kill us to get them? We want them all ourselves. Your pretty girls  are pretty enough without them. We are told that it is as easy for you  to do it as for a blackbird to whistle.    \"If you will, we know how to pay you a hundred times over. We will  teach your children to keep themselves clean and neat. We will show  them how to live together in peace and love and to agree as we do in  our nests. We will build pretty houses which you will like to see. We  will play about your garden and flowerbeds--ourselves like flowers on  wings--without any cost to you. We will destroy the wicked insects and  worms that spoil your cherries and currants and plums and apples and  roses. We will give you our best songs, and make the spring more  beautiful and the summer sweeter to you. Every June morning when you go  out into the field, Oriole and Bluebird and Blackbird and Bobolink will  fly after you, and make the day more delightful to you. And when you go  home tired after sundown Vesper Sparrow will tell you how grateful we  are. When you sit down on your porch after dark, Fifebird and Hermit  Thrush and Wood Thrush will sing to you; and even Whip-poor-will will  cheer you up a little. We know where we are safe. In a little while all  the birds will come to live in Massachusetts again, and everybody who  loves music will like to make a summer home with you.\"    The singers are:     Brown Thrasher,         King Bird,   Robert o'Lincoln,       Swallow,   Vesper Sparrow,         Cedar Bird,   Hermit Thrush,          Cow-bird,   Robin Redbreast,        Martin,   Song Sparrow,           Veery,   Scarlet Tanager,        Vireo,   Summer Redbird,         Oriole,   Blue Heron,             Blackbird,   Humming Bird,           Fifebird,   Yellow-bird,            Wren,   Whip-poor-will,         Linnet,   Water Wagtail,          Pewee,   Woodpecker,             Phoebe,   Pigeon Woodpecker,      Yoke Bird,   Indigo Bird,            Lark,   Yellow Throat,          Sandpiper,   Wilson's Thrush,        Chewink.   Chickadee,          THE CAPTIVE'S ESCAPE.          I saw such a sorrowful sight, my dears,        Such a sad and sorrowful sight,      As I lingered under the swaying vines,        In the silvery morning light.      The skies were so blue and the day was so fair        With beautiful things untold,      You would think no sad and sorrowful thing        Could enter its heart of gold.        A fairy-like cage was hanging there,        So gay with turret and dome.      You'd be sure a birdie would gladly make        Such a beautiful place its home.      But a wee little yellow-bird sadly chirped        As it fluttered to and fro;      I know it was longing with all its heart        To its wild-wood home to go.        I heard a whir of swift-rushing wings,        And an answering gladsome note;      As close to its nestlings' prison bars,        I saw the poor mother bird float.

In fact, the symbolical use of  the Eagle is of very remote antiquity. It was the insignia of Egypt, of  the Etruscans, was the sacred bird of the Hindoos, and of the Greeks,  who connected him with Zeus, their supreme deity. With the Scandinavians  the Eagle is the bird of wisdom. The double-headed Eagle was in use  among the Byzantine emperors, \"to indicate their claims to the empire of  both the east and the west.\" It was adopted in the 14th century by the  German emperors. The arms of Prussia were distinguished by the Black  Eagle, and those of Poland by the White. The great Napoleon adopted it  as the emblem of Imperial France.    Old Abe was called by the soldiers the \"new recruit from Chippewa,\" and  sworn into the service of the United States by encircling his neck with  red, white, and blue ribbons, and by placing on his breast a rosette of  colors, after which he was carried by the regiment into every engagement  in which it participated, perched upon a shield in the shape of a heart.  A few inches above the shield was a grooved crosspiece for the Eagle to  rest upon, on either end of which were three arrows. When in line Old  Abe was always carried on the left of the color bearer, in the van of  the regiment. The color bearer wore a belt to which was attached a  socket for the end of the staff, which was about five feet in length.  Thus the Eagle was high above the bearer's head, in plain sight of the  column. A ring of leather was fastened to one of the Eagle's legs to  which was connected a strong hemp cord about twenty feet long.    Old Abe was the hero of about twenty-five battles, and as many  skirmishes. Remarkable as it may appear, not one bearer of the flag, or  of the Eagle, always shining marks for the enemy's rifles, was ever shot  down. Once or twice Old Abe suffered the loss of a few feathers, but he  was never wounded.    The great bird enjoyed the excitement of carnage. In battle he flapped  his wings, his eyes blazed, and with piercing screams, which arose above  the noise of the conflict, seemed to urge the company on to deeds of  valor.    David McLane, who was the first color bearer to carry him into battle,  said:    \"Old Abe, like all old soldiers, seemed to dread the sound of musketry  but with the roll of artillery he appeared to be in his glory. Then he  screamed, spread his wings at every discharge, and reveled in the roar  and smoke of the big guns.\" A correspondent who watched him closely said  that when a battle had fairly begun Old Abe jumped up and down on his  perch with such wild and fearful screams as an eagle alone can utter.  The louder the battle, the fiercer and wilder were his screams.    Old Abe varied his voice in accord with his emotions. When surprised he  whistled a wild melody of a melancholy softness; when hovering over his  food he gave a spiteful chuckle; when pleased to see an old friend he  seemed to say: \"How do you do?\" with a plaintive cooing. In battle his  scream was wild and commanding, a succession of five or six notes with a  startling trill that was inspiring to the soldiers. Strangers could not  approach or touch him with safety, though members of the regiment who  treated him with kindness were cordially recognized by him. Old Abe had  his particular friends, as well as some whom he regarded as his enemies.  There were men in the company whom he would not permit to approach him.  He would fly at and tear them with his beak and talons. But he would  never fight his bearer. He knew his own regiment from every other, would  always accompany its cheer, and never that of any other regiment.    Old Abe more than once escaped, but was always lured by food to return.  He never seemed disposed to depart to the blue empyrean, his ancestral  home.    Having served three years, a portion of the members of Company C were  mustered out, and Old Abe was presented to the state of Wisconsin. For  many years, on occasions of public exercise or review, like other  illustrious veterans, he excited in parade universal and enthusiastic  attention.    He occupied pleasant quarters in the State Capitol at Madison,  Wisconsin, until his death at an advanced age.           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  SNOWY HERON OR LITTLE EGRET.                  CHICAGO COLORTYPE CO.]    THE SNOWY HERON.        \"What does it cost this garniture of death?        It costs the life which God alone can give;      It costs dull silence where was music's breath,        It costs dead joy, that foolish pride may live.      Ah, life, and joy, and song, depend upon it,      Are costly trimmings for a woman's bonnet!\"                                     --MAY RILEY SMITH.      Temperate and tropical America, from Long Island to Oregon, south to  Buenos Ayres, may be considered the home of the Snowy Heron, though it  is sometimes seen on the Atlantic coast as far as Nova Scotia. It is  supposed to be an occasional summer resident as far north as Long  Island, and it is found along the entire gulf coast and the shores of  both oceans. It is called the Little White Egret, and is no doubt the  handsomest bird of the tribe. It is pure white, with a crest composed of  many long hair-like feathers, a like plume on the lower neck, and the  same on the back, which are recurved when perfect.    Snowy Herons nest in colonies, preferring willow bushes in the marshes  for this purpose. The nest is made in the latter part of April or early  June. Along the gulf coast of Florida, they nest on the Mangrove  Islands, and in the interior in the willow ponds and swamps, in company  with the Louisiana and Little Blue Herons. The nest is simply a platform  of sticks, and from two to five eggs are laid.    Alas, plume hunters have wrought such destruction to these lovely birds  that very few are now found in the old nesting places. About 1889,  according to Mr. F. M. Woodruff, this bird was almost completely  exterminated in Florida, the plume hunters transferring their base of  operation to the Texas coast of the Gulf, and the bird is now in a fair  way to be utterly destroyed there also. He found them very rare in 1891  at Matagorda Bay, Texas. This particular specimen is a remarkably fine  one, from the fact that it has fifty-two plumes, the ordinary number  being from thirty to forty.    Nothing for some time has been more commonly seen than the delicate airy  plumes which stand upright in ladies' bonnets. These little feathers,  says a recent writer, were provided by nature as the nuptial adornment  of the White Heron. Many kind-hearted women who would not on any account  do a cruel act, are, by following this fashion, causing the continuance  of a great cruelty. If ladies who are seemingly so indifferent to the  inhumanity practiced by those who provide them with this means of  adornment would apply to the Humane Education Committee, Providence,  R. I., for information on the subject, they would themselves be aroused  to the necessity of doing something towards the protection of our birds.  Much is, however, being done by good men and women to this end.    The Little Egret moves through the air with a noble and rapid flight. It  is curious to see it pass directly overhead. The head, body and legs are  held in line, stiff and immovable, and the gently waving wings carry the  bird along with a rapidity that seems the effect of magic.    An old name of this bird was Hern, or Hernshaw, from which was derived  the saying, \"He does not know a Hawk from a Hernshaw.\" The last word has  been corrupted into \"handsaw,\" rendering the proverb meaningless.
