Next fill a small beaker with distilled water. Attach the first pipette  to the free end of the rubber tubing, place the pipette point downward  in the beaker of water and start the pump (Fig. 22).    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Cleaning blood pipettes.]    When all the water has been aspirated through the pipette into the  filter flask, fill the beaker with rectified spirit and when this is  exhausted refill with ether. Detach the pipette and dry in the hot-air  oven.    ~Slides and cover-slips~ (Fig. 23), when first purchased, have \"greasy\"  surfaces, upon which water gathers in minute drops and effectually  prevents the spreading of thin, even films.    ~Microscopical Slides.~--The slides in general use are those known as  \"three by one\" slips (measuring 3 inches by 1 inch, or 76 by 26 mm.),  and should be of good white crown glass, with ground edges.    ~New slides~ should be allowed to remain in alcohol acidulated with 5 per  cent. hydrochloric acid for some hours, rinsed in running water, roughly  drained on a towel, dried, and finally polished with a selvyt cloth.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Slides and cover-slips, actual size.]    If only a few slides are required for immediate use a good plan is to  rub the surface with jeweler's emery paper (Hubert's 00). A piece of  hard wood 76x26x26 mm. with a piece of this emery paper gummed tightly  around it is an exceedingly useful article on the microscope bench.    ~Cover-slips.~--The most useful sizes are the 19 mm. squares for ordinary  cover-glass film preparations, and 38 by 19 mm. rectangles for blood  films and serial sections; both varieties must be of \"No. 1\" thickness,  which varies between 0.15 and 0.22 mm., that they may be available for  use with the high-power immersion lenses.    Cover-slips should be cleaned in the following manner:    1. Drop the cover-slips one by one into an enamelled iron pot or tall  glass beaker, containing a 10 per cent. solution of chromic acid.    2. Heat over a Bunsen flame and allow the acid to boil gently for twenty  minutes.         NOTE.--A few pieces of pipe-clay or pumice may be placed in       the beaker to prevent the \"spurting\" of the chromic acid.    3. Turn the cover-slips out into a flat glass dish and wash in running  water under the tap until all trace of yellow colour has disappeared.  During the washing keep the cover-slips in motion by imparting a  rotatory movement to the dish.    4. Wash in distilled water in a similar manner.    5. Wash in rectified spirit.    6. Transfer the cover-slips, by means of a pair of clean forceps,  previously heated in the Bunsen flame to destroy any trace of grease, to  a small beaker of absolute alcohol.    Drain off the alcohol and transfer the cover-slips, by means of the  forceps, to a wide-mouthed glass pot, containing absolute alcohol, in  which they are to be stored, and stopper tightly.         NOTE.--After once being placed in the chromic acid, the       cover-slips must on no account be touched by the fingers.    ~Used Slides and Cover-slips.~--Used slides with the mounted cover-slip  preparations, and cover-slips used for hanging-drop mounts, should, when  discarded, be thrown into a pot containing a 2 per cent. solution of  lysol.    After immersion therein for a week or so, even the cover-slips mounted  with Canada balsam can be readily detached from their slides.      _Slides._--    1. Wash the slides thoroughly in running water.    2. Boil the slides in water to which \"sapon\" has been added, for half an  hour.    3. Rinse thoroughly in cold water.    4. Dry and polish with a dry cloth.      _Cover-slips._--    1. Wash the cover-slips thoroughly in running water.    2. Boil the cover-slips in 10 per cent. solution of chromic acid, as for  new cover-slips.    3. Wash thoroughly in running water.    4. Pick out those cover-slips which show much adherent dirty matter, and  rub them between thumb and forefinger under the water tap. The dirt  usually rubs off easily, as it has become friable from contact with the  chromic acid.    5. Return all the cover-slips to the beaker, fill in _fresh_ chromic  acid solution, and treat as new cover-slips.         NOTE.--_Test-tubes, plates, capsules_, etc., which, from       long use, have become scratched and hazy, or which cannot be       cleaned in any other way, may be dealt with by immersing       them in an enamelled iron bath, containing water acidulated       to 1 per cent. with hydrofluoric acid, for ten minutes,       rinsing thoroughly in water, drying, and polishing.      PLUGGING TEST-TUBES AND FLASKS.    Before sterilisation all test-tubes and flasks must be carefully plugged  with cotton-wool, and for this purpose best absorbent cotton-wool  (preferably that put up in cylindrical one-pound packets and interleaved  with tissue paper--known as surgeons' wool) should be employed.    1. For a test-tube or a small flask, tear a strip of cotton-wool some 10  cm. long by 2 cm. wide from the roll.    2. Turn in the ends neatly and roll the strip of wool lightly between  the thumb and fingers of both hands to form a long cylinder.    3. Double this at the centre and introduce the now rounded end into the  open mouth of the tube or flask.    4. Now, whilst supporting the wool between the thumb and fingers of the  right hand, rotate the test-tube between those of the left, and  gradually screw the plug of wool into its mouth for a distance of about  2.5 cm., leaving about the same length of wool projecting.    [Illustration: FIG 24..--Plugging test-tubes: a, cylinder of wool  being rolled; b, cylinder of wool being doubled; c, cylinder of wool  being inserted in tube.]    The plug must be firm and fit the tube or flask fairly tightly,  sufficiently tightly in fact to bear the weight of the glass plus the  amount of medium the vessel is intended to contain, but not so tightly  as to prevent it from being easily removed by a screwing motion when  grasped between the fourth, or third and fourth, fingers, and the palm  of the hand.    For a large flask a similar but larger strip of wool must be taken; the  method of making and inserting the plug is identical.          III. METHODS OF STERILISATION.      STERILISING AGENTS.    Sterilisation--i. e., the removal or the destruction of germ life--may  be effected by the use of various agents. As applied to the practical  requirements of the bacteriological laboratory, many of these agents,  such as electricity, sunlight, etc., are of little value, others are  limited in their applications; others again are so well suited to  particular purposes that their use is almost entirely restricted to  such.    The sterilising agents in common use are:    ~Chemical Reagents.~--_Disinfectants_ (for the disinfection of glass and  metal apparatus and of morbid tissues).    ~Physical Agents.~ HEAT.--(a) _Dry Heat:_    1. Naked flame (for the sterilisation of platinum needles, etc.).    2. Muffle furnace (for the sterilisation of filter candles, and for the  destruction of morbid tissues).    3. Hot air (for the sterilisation of all glassware and of metal  apparatus).    (b) _Moist Heat:_    1. Water at 56 deg. C. (for the sterilisation of certain albuminous  fluids).    2. Water at 100 deg. C. (for the sterilisation of surgical instruments,  rubber tubing, and stoppers, etc.).    3. Streaming steam at 100 deg. C. (for the sterilisation of media).    4. Superheated steam at 115 deg. C. or 120 deg. C. (for the disinfection  of contaminated articles and the destruction of old cultivations of  bacteria).    FILTRATION.--    1. Cotton-wool filters (for the sterilisation of air and gases).    2. Porcelain filters (for the sterilisation of various liquids).      METHODS OF APPLICATION.    ~Chemical Reagents~, such as belong to the class known as antiseptics (_i.  e._, substances which inhibit the growth of, but do not destroy,  bacterial life), are obviously useless. Disinfectants or germicides (_i.  e._, substances which destroy bacterial life), on the other hand, are of  value in the disinfection of morbid material, and also of various pieces  of apparatus, such as pipettes, pending their cleansing and complete  sterilisation by other processes. To this class (in order of general  utility) belong:        Lysol, 2 per cent. solution;      Perchloride of mercury, 0.1 per cent. solution;      Carbolic acid, 5 per cent. solution;      Absolute alcohol;      Ether;      Chloroform;      Camphor;      Thymol;      Toluol;      Volatile oils, such as oil of mustard, oil of garlic.    Formaldehyde is a powerful germicide, but its penetrating vapor  restricts its use. These disinfectants are but little used in the final  sterilisation of apparatus, chiefly on account of the difficulty of  effecting their complete removal, for the presence of even traces of  these chemicals is sufficient to so inhibit or alter the growth of  bacteria as to vitiate subsequent experiments conducted by the aid of  apparatus sterilised in this manner.         NOTE.--Tubes, flasks, filter flasks, pipettes, glass tubing,       etc., may be rapidly sterilised, in case of emergency, by       washing, in turn, with distilled water, perchloride of       mercury solution, alcohol, and ether, draining, and finally       gently heating over a gas flame to completely drive off the       ether vapor. Chloroform or other volatile disinfectants may       be added to various fluids in order to effect the       destruction of contained bacteria, and when this has been       done, may be completely driven off from the fluid by the       application of gentle heat.    ~Dry Heat.~--The _naked flame_ of the Bunsen burner is invariably used for  sterilising the platinum needles (which are heated to redness) and may  be employed for sterilising the points of forceps, or other small  instruments, cover-glasses, pipettes, etc., a very short"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#5)"],[1,"branches of knowledge. It must be obvious to every one,  that it can be by no means an easy task to give in a few lectures,  a perspicuous view of so extensive a subject; but I trust that the  consideration of this difficulty will readily extend to me your  indulgence.    That such a course, if properly conducted, must be interesting,  needs scarcely to be observed; for the more we examine the  structure and functions of the human body, the more we admire the  excellence of the workmanship, and beauty of contrivance, which  presents itself in every part, and which continually shows the  hand of omniscience. The most ingenious of human inventions, when  compared with the animal frame, indicate a poverty of contrivance  which cannot fail to humble the pretensions of the sons of men.  Surely then there are few who will not feel a desire to become  acquainted with subjects so interesting.    But there is another point of view which will place the utility of  such inquiries in a still stronger light. We shall afterwards see,  that our life is continually supported by the action of a number  of substances, by which the body is surrounded, and which are  taken into the stomach for its nourishment. On the due action of  these depends the pleasant performance of the different functions,  or the state of health; without which, riches, honours, and every  other gratification, become joyless and insipid.    By understanding the manner in which these powers act, or, in  other words, by becoming acquainted with the principles of  physiology, we shall be enabled to regulate them, so as, in a  great measure, to guard against the numerous ills that flesh is  heir to: for it is universally agreed, that by far the greatest  part of the diseases to which mankind are subject, have been  brought on by intemperance, imprudence, and the neglect of  precautions, which often arises from carelessness, but much  oftener from ignorance of those precautions.    Physiological ignorance is, undoubtedly, the most abundant source  of our sufferings; every person accustomed to the sick must have  heard them deplore their ignorance of the necessary consequences  of those practises, by which their health has been destroyed: and  when men shall be deeply convinced, that the eternal laws of  nature have connected pain and decrepitude with one mode of life,  and health and vigour with another, they will avoid the former and  adhere to the latter.    It is strange, however, to observe that the generality of mankind  do not seem to bestow a single thought on the preservation of  their health, till it is too late to reap any benefit from their  conviction: so that we may say of health, as we do of time, we  take no notice of it but by its loss; and feel the value of it  when we can no longer think of it but with retrospect and regret.    When we take a view of the human frame, and see how admirably each  part is contrived for the performance of its different functions,  and even for repairing its own injuries, we might at first sight  imagine, that such a structure, unless destroyed by external  force, should continue for ever in vigour, and in health: and it  is by mournful experience alone that we are convinced of the  contrary. The strongest constitution, which never experienced the  qualms of sickness, or the torture of disease, and which seems to  bid defiance to the enemies of health that surround it, is not  proof against the attacks of age. Even in the midst of life we are  in death; how many of us have contemplated with admiration the  graceful motion of the female form; the eye sparkling with  intelligence; the countenance enlivened by wit, or animated by  feeling: a single instant is sufficient to dispel the charm: often  without apparent cause, sensation and motion cease at once; the  body loses its warmth, the eyes their lustre, and the lips and  cheeks become livid. These, as Cuvier observes, are but preludes  to changes still more hideous. The colour passes successively to a  blue, a green, and a black; the flesh absorbs moisture, and while  one part of it escapes in pestilential exhalations, the remaining  part falls down into a putrid liquid mass. In a short time no part  of the body remains, but a few earthy and saline principles; its  other elements being dispersed through air, or carried off by  water, to form new combinations, and afford food for other  animals.    The human body has been defined to be a machine composed of bones  and muscles, with their proper appendages, for the purpose of  motion, at the instance of its intelligent principle. From this  principle, nerves, or instruments of sensation, are likewise  detached to the various parts of the body, for such information as  may be necessary to determine it to those motions of the body,  which may conduce to the happiness of the former, and the  preservation of both.    It may perhaps be objected to this definition, that the body  consists of other parts besides bones, muscles, and nerves; this  is undoubtedly true; but, if we examine more minutely, we shall  find that all the other parts, as well as functions of the body,  seem only to be subservient to the purposes I have mentioned. For,  in the first place, the muscles which are necessary to the motions  of the body, are, from the nature of their constitution, subject  to continual waste; to repair which waste, some of the other  functions have been contrived.    Secondly, most of the other parts and functions of the body, are  either necessary to the action of the muscles, or to the operation  of the intelligent principle, or both.    Lastly, from the sensibility, and delicate structure, of the  muscles and nerves, they require to be defended from external  injuries: this is done by membranes, and other contrivances,  fitted for the purpose.    To see this more clearly, we shall examine a little more  particularly how each of the functions is subservient to the  muscular and nervous systems. For this purpose it may be observed,  1st. that the stomach and digestive faculties serve to assimilate  the food, or convert it into matter proper to repair the continual  waste of solids and fluids. The circulation of the blood besides  being absolutely necessary, as we shall afterwards see, to the  action of the muscles, distributes the nourishment, thus  assimilated and prepared by the stomach, to all parts of the body.  The different glands separate liquors from the blood, for useful,  but still for subservient purposes. Thus the salivary glands,  stomach, pancreas, and liver, separate juices necessary to the  proper digestion and assimilation of the food. The kidneys serve  to strain off from the blood the useless and superfluous water,  salts, &c. which if allowed to remain in the body would be very  injurious to it.    We shall afterwards see, that the nerves are not only instruments  of sensation, but the origin of motion; it being immediately by  their means that the muscles are moved. A certain degree of heat  is necessary to keep the blood fluid, and also to the action of  the nerves; without either of which, no motion could be performed.  Respiration or breathing is so necessary to life, that it cannot  exist, even a few minutes, without the exercise of that function;  and yet we shall afterwards see, that the ultimate end of  respiration is to keep the body in a proper state, for the  purposes of muscular motion and sensation.    The skin serves like a sheath to defend the body from injuries;  the skull serves the same purpose to the brain, which is the  origin of the nerves. The different membranes separate the fibres,  muscles, nerves, and various organs of the body, from each other.  Hence we see that there is no impropriety, in calling the human  body a machine composed of bones and muscles, with their proper  appendages, for the purpose of motion, at the instance of its  intelligent principle.    In order to show more clearly how each part is subservient to  these ends, I shall give a short account of the structure of the  human body, but I must premise, that the nature of this course  will prevent my entering minutely into anatomical detail. All that  can be done is, to give such a general outline of anatomy and  physiology, as will furnish individuals with so much knowledge of  themselves, as may enable them to guard against habitual sickness.    Among the solid parts of the human frame the bones stand  conspicuous. Their use is, to give firmness and shape to the body.  Some of them likewise serve as armour, or defense, to guard  important parts; thus the skull is admirably contrived to defend  the brain; and the spine or backbone is designed, not only to  strengthen the body, but to shield that continuation of the brain,  called the spinal marrow, from whence originate great numbers of  nerves, which pass through convenient openings of this bone, and  are distributed to various parts of the body. In the structure of  this, as well as every other part, the wisdom of the Creator is  manifest. Had it been a single bone, the loins must have been  inflexible; to avoid which, it consists of a number of small  bones, articulated or joined together with great exactness, which  are strengthened by compact ligaments. Hence it becomes capable of  various inflections, without injuring the nerves, or diminishing  that strength which is so much required.    The whole system of bones, or skeleton, is constructed of several  parts, of different shapes and sizes, joining with one another in  various manners, and so knit together, as best to answer to the  motions which the occasions of the animal may require.    These bones serve as levers for the muscles to act on; which last  serve as mechanical powers, to give the machine various motions,  at the command of the will.    The muscles are fleshy fibres, attached by their extremities to  the bones. When the fibres shorten themselves, the two parts into  which the"]]]
