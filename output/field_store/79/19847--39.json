These were ranged in an old case, standing upright  against the corrugated iron wall, where, a few boardings nailed across  for shelves, the boy had an extremely rough but useful cabinet, the lid  of the case forming the door when attached by a pair of leather hinges  tacked on with wire nails.    \"There,\" said Emson, when the last plumes had been removed; \"what do you  say to having the skin off?  It will make a mat.\"    Dyke nodded, and the Kaffir now helping, the bird's tough skin was  stripped off, and laid, feathers downward, on the roof to dry.    \"Jackals can't reach it there, can they?\" said Emson.    \"No, I think not.  Leopard might come and pull it down.\"    \"Yes: don't let Duke be out of a night; there has been one hanging about  lately.--But what are you going to do?\"    \"Dissect him,\" said Dyke, who was on his knees with his sharp  sheath-knife in his hand.    \"Nonsense!  Leave it now.\"    \"I want to see the poor old goblin's gizzard, and open it.  I know he  has got knives and all sorts of things inside.\"    \"Then you may look,\" said Emson.  \"I'm going to feed the horses and have  a wash; they haven't been unsaddled yet.\"    He went to the thorn-fence and disappeared, while, hot and tired now,  Dyke made short work of opening the great bird, and dragging out the  gizzard, which he opened as a cook does that of a fowl, and exclaimed  aloud at the contents:    \"Here, Jack, fetch me some water in the tin;\" and while the \"boy\" was  gone, Dyke scraped out on to the sand quite a heap of pieces of flinty  stone, rough crystals, and some pieces of iron, rusty nails, and a  good-sized piece of hoop.    \"I must have a look at you afterwards,\" said the boy, as he picked out  some forty or fifty of the dingy-looking rough crystals, gave them a rub  over and over in the dry sand upon which he knelt, to dry them, and then  thrust them--a good handful--into his pocket.    \"Do for the collection,\" he said to himself with a laugh.  \"Label:  crystals of quartz, discovered in a goblin's gizzard by Vandyke Emson,  Esquire, F.A.S., Kopfontein, South Africa.\"    \"Wanterwater?\"    \"Yes, I do `wanterwater,'\" cried Dyke, turning sharply on the Kaffir,  who had returned.  \"I want to wash my hands.  Look at 'em, Jack!\"    \"Narcy!\" said the man, making a grimace.    \"Hold hard, though; let's have a drink first,\" cried the boy.  \"It looks  clean;\" and raising the tin, he took a deep draught before using the  vessel for a good wash, taking a handful of sand in the place of soap.    \"Find the knife?\" said Emson, coming back from the stable.    \"No, but look here,\" cried Dyke, pointing to the great piece of  hoop-iron.  \"Fancy a bird swallowing that.\"    \"Iron is good for birds, I suppose,\" said Emson quietly.--\"Here, Jack,  drag that bird right away off; remember, a good way.  Mind, I don't want  the jackals too close to-night.\"    The Kaffir nodded, seized the bird's legs as if they were the shafts of  a cart or handles of a wheelbarrow.    The load was heavy, though, and he shook his head, with reason, for such  a bird weighed three hundred pounds, and it spoke well for its leg  muscles that it could go at the rate of forty or fifty miles an hour.    \"Too big,\" grumbled Jack; so Dyke seized one of the legs, and together  they walked away with the dead bird, dragging it quite a quarter of a  mile out beyond the ostrich-pens, ready for the jackals to come and play  scavenger.  After which Dyke returned to his brother, and they went in  to where Tanta Sal, Jack's wife, had prepared a substantial meal.        CHAPTER FIVE.    BIG BIRDNESTING.    \"You're a dissatisfied young dog, Dyke,\" cried Joe Emson  good-humouredly, as he smiled down from his high horse at his brother;  \"always grumbling.\"    \"I'm not,\" cried Dyke indignantly.    \"You are, boy.  Just as if any one could be low-spirited when he is  young and strong, out in this wide free place on such a lovely morning.\"    \"It's all right enough now,\" replied Dyke, \"because it's early and cool;  but it is so horribly lonely.\"    \"Lonely!  Why, I'm always with you,\" cried Emson--\"the best of company.  Then you've Jack and Tanta Sal, and Duke, and Breezy, and all the  ostriches for pets, and the oxen; while, if you want more company,  there's old Oom Schlagen out one way, and old Morgenstern out the  other.\"    \"Ugh!  Stupid old Boers!\" cried Dyke.    \"Well, they're civil to you, and that's more than Oom Schlagen is to me.  It's because you have got that Dutch name.  I say, father meant you to  be a painter, I'll be bound, and here you are, an ostrich-farmer.\"    \"Oh yes, and we're going to be very rich when the birds are all dead.\"    \"And they seem as if they meant to die, all of them,\" said Emson sadly,  as he rode along by his brother, each with his rifle across his  saddle-bow.  \"I don't seem to have got hold of the right way of managing  them, Dyke: we must follow nature more by watching the habits of the  wild ones.  I have tried so hard, too.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Dyke merrily.  \"Who's grumbling now!\"    \"That's better, and more like yourself, old fellow,\" said Emson, smiling  down pleasantly.  \"That's more like the light-hearted chap who promised  to stick to and help me like a brother should.  You hurt me, Dyke, when  you turn so low-spirited and sulky.  I've plenty of troubles, though I  say little, over my venture here; and when I see you so down, it worries  me more than I can say.\"    They rode on over the open veldt that glorious morning in silence for  some minutes, and Dyke looked down at his horse's mane.    \"It makes me feel that I have done wrong in bringing a bright, happy lad  away from home and his studies to this wild solitary place.  I ought to  have known better, and that it was not natural for a boy like you to  feel the hard stern determination to get on that I, ten years older,  possessed.  I ought to have known that, as soon as the novelty had  passed away, you would begin to long for change.  Father did warn me,  but I said to him: `I'm a man, and he's only a boy; but we've been  together so much, and always been companions, Dyke and I can't help  getting on together.'\"    \"And we can't,\" cried the boy in a husky voice.  \"Don't, please don't,  Joe, old chap; I can't bear it.  I've been a beast.\"    \"Oh, come, come,\" cried Emson, leaning over to clap him on the shoulder;  \"I didn't mean to upset you like that.\"    \"But I'm glad you have,\" cried Dyke in half-suffocated tones.  \"I know  well enough I have been a beast to you, Joe, and the more quiet and  patient you've been with me, the worse I've got, till I quite hate  myself.\"    \"Oh no, not so bad as that.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Dyke excitedly, \"it's been worse; and all the while you've  been the dear, good old chap to me; just the same as it always was when  I was little, and grew tired and cross when we were out, and you took me  up on your back and carried me miles and miles home.\"    \"Why, of course I did,\" said Emson, smiling.    \"There's no of course in it.  I was always petty and disagreeable, and  ready to impose on your good-nature; but you never had an unkind word  for me.\"    \"Well, you were such a little one, and I was always so big.\"    \"I can see it all, Joe, and it's made me miserable many a time; but the  kinder you've been, the worse it has made me.  You and father always  spoiled and petted me.\"    \"Not we.  Only kind to you, because we liked you.  I say, Dyke, what  games we used to have!  You see, I never had a brother till you came.  There, it's all right.  Now then for a canter.\"    \"Not yet,\" said Dyke.  \"I feel as if I could talk to you this morning.\"    \"But you have talked, and it's all over now; so come along.\"    \"No,\" cried Dyke firmly, and he caught his brother's rein.    \"I say, old chap, are you the boss here, or am I?\"    \"I am, this morning,\" said the boy, looking up in his brother's big  manly face.  \"I want you to listen to me.\"    \"Well, go ahead then, and let's get it over.\"    \"It's been like this, Joe.  I've got in a bad way of thinking lately.  It's all been so disappointing, and no matter what one did, nothing came  right.\"    \"Yes, that's true enough, old chap,\" said Emson, rather drearily; \"and  we have tried precious hard.\"    \"You have, Joe, and I've been a regular sulky, disappointed sort of  brute.\"    \"Coat been a bit rough, Dyke, old chap, eh?  Out of sorts.\"    \"I suppose in my head; but, Joe, I am sorry--I can't say it as I should  like to, but I--I will try now.\"    \"Just as if I didn't know.  We've been chums so long, old man, ever  since you first took to me when I was a big stupid fellow, all legs like  a colt, and as ugly, and you were a pretty little golden-haired chap,  always wanting to stick your soft chubby little fist in my big paw.  There, it's all right.  Old times again, old un, and we're going to do  it yet, eh?\"    \"And you'll forgive me, Joe?\" said Dyke earnestly.    \"Forgive you?\" cried Emson, looking at his brother with his big pleasant  manly face all in wrinkles.  \"Get along with you!  What is there to  forgive?\"    \"I will try now and help you, Joe; I will, indeed.\"    \"Of course you will, old chap,\" cried Joe, a little huskily too; \"and if  you and I can't win yet, in spite of the hot sun and the disease and the  wicked ways of those jolly old stilt-stalkers, nobody can.\"    \"Yes, we will win, Joe,\" cried Dyke enthusiastically.    \"That's your sort!\" cried Emson.  \"We'll have a good long try, and if  the ostriches don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24852"],[0,"The Wonders of the Jungle, Book One (#5)"],[1," England. On that day a lovely cloth of silk woven with gold was put on  the elephant's back, and around his tusks were placed rings of solid  gold studded with real diamonds, rubies, and pearls.    At another time he carried on his back the Crown Prince of Germany,  when he visited India a few years ago; and at other times he has  carried Grand Dukes of Russia and Arch Dukes of Austria when _they_  visited India.    So you see, he is quite the grandest elephant in the world. He has a  real name, just like a man, and it is written down in books with the  names of all the grand officers of the palace. His name is Salar  Jung; so we shall call him Salar for short.    He was born in the jungle, and his Papa and Mamma were quite wild  then. It was only after he grew up that Salar came to live in a  palace.      _Elephant Child \"Swats\" Tormenting Flies_    But now about Salar's early boyhood. After his Mamma had taught him to  swim, to eat from the boughs of trees, and to drink for himself by  dipping his trunk into the water, she had another useful thing to  teach him. In the jungle there are swarms of tormenting flies; they  come buzzing around the elephants, and bother them, just as they  bother us. Now, _we_ can whisk off the flies with our hands, but how  about an elephant?    Of course, you will say, his trunk is his hand; and so he can use the  trunk to slap the flies or whisk them off. True, but the trunk will  not reach more than halfway down the side of the body; and the  elephant is too stiff to bend his body as we do; and his tail is too  short to reach even a yard each way. Then how can he get rid of the  flies where he cannot reach them? Just think!    If he only could make his trunk _longer_! But how could he do that?  Very simply! Of course he cannot actually make the trunk longer, but  he breaks off a small bough of a tree and holds it at the end of his  trunk; then he uses the bough like a fan, and whisks off, or brushes  off, the flies with it.    And that is what Salar's Mamma taught him to do. After that he was  very comfortable.    Not quite; he had just one more thing to learn from his Mamma, to make  him quite comfortable. The sun gets very hot, and when the elephants  are feeding from tree to tree, or marching through the jungle, they  feel the hot sun on their backs dreadfully--although they have a thick  skin.    Now, how could they guard themselves from the hot sun? Just think!    Why, just as _we_ do, you will say, by using a kind of umbrella! Of  course you mean that an elephant could break off a large bough, and  hold it over his head and over his back! But his trunk would soon get  tired of holding anything as big as that! Besides, he has to use his  trunk all the time to feed! If _you_ had only one hand, you could not  eat with it and at the same time hold an umbrella over your head with  it! Then how _does_ the elephant manage it?      _Elephant Covers his Back from Hot Sun_    I shall tell you. He breaks off many small boughs, one at a time, and  lays them on his back with his trunk; he is careful to lay them in  proper order, and to criss-cross them, so that the boughs will not  fall off. In fact, he tries to arrange them very much like the  thatched roof of a cottage. That is very clever of him, is it not?    But then he does something else, still more clever! When a cottager  builds his thatched roof, he has to plaster the ceiling to prevent any  rain or sunshine from creeping in through the little spaces between  the thatches. So also the thatch on the elephant's back has many gaps,  through which the hot sun can still beat down on his skin. So what  does he do to fill up the gaps?    He cannot do anything to _plaster_ his back; but I shall tell you what  he does do. He just draws into his trunk a lot of dust from the  ground; then he curls up the trunk over his back, and blows the dust  over the gaps in the thatch on his back. Of course he has to do that  many times to fill up all the gaps; but at last, when he does not  _feel_ the sun any more, he knows that his back is quite covered.    Is not that a very wonderful thing for the elephants to think out, all  by themselves? And that is what Salar's Mamma taught him to do.    But, a few years later, he came to the age when boys among men usually  have to go to school. Then Salar passed to the care of his Papa. In  feeding through the jungle, when all the elephants march and eat from  tree to tree, Salar walked with his Papa, and began to learn lessons  from him. And his Papa's way of teaching him was quite different from  that of his Mamma, and often very funny!      _How Elephants Walk under Water_    The first thing he taught was at the stream at midnight. By this time  Salar could swim quite well; so he was enjoying himself with the  grown-ups. But his Papa kept watching him with the corner of his eye.  Little by little he drew nearer and nearer to Salar, and waited till  the youngster came to a part where the water was not at all deep. Then  suddenly his Papa gave Salar a butt with his head. Down went Salar  under the water, snorting and spluttering and hollering.    \"Hold up your trunk, you simp!\" cried his Papa.    But Salar was too frightened to remember to hold up his trunk; so his  Papa caught Salar's trunk in his own and hoisted it clear out of the  water. Then what was Salar's joy and surprise to find that he could  breathe quite well, though his feet were actually touching the bottom  of the stream. Of course he kicked out, and tried to get up to the top  of the water again. But--    \"Stay there!\" cried his Papa, giving him another butt, though still  holding the youngster's trunk carefully out of the water.    Then Salar lost all fear of the water; he was not a bit afraid of  being ducked, so long as the tip of his trunk was out of the water. So  he learned to do a wonderful thing--he learned to remain completely  under the water, so that his feet were actually resting on the bottom  of the stream, with only the tip of his trunk out of the water. No  other animal can do that.    And the most astonishing thing about it is that the elephants have  taught themselves to do that trick; so that _a whole herd of  elephants can walk into a stream in time of danger, and disappear  from sight_, the smaller ones standing in the shallow parts, and the  full-grown ones standing in the deeper parts.    I have known of lots of hunters, who were chasing a herd of elephants  and who saw the elephants run ahead toward a river, to find to their  surprise, on reaching the river, that the whole herd had disappeared  as if by magic. They saw nothing, and did not dream that the little  things floating here and there, no bigger than your fist, could mean  anything. But of course they were the tips of the trunks of the  elephants hidden under the water.    To have thought out even that one trick for themselves proves that the  elephants are the wisest of all animals, next after men folks. And  they have thought out many more tricks, as I shall tell you very soon.    But now I shall tell you the next trick that Salar's father taught  him. An elephant often has to break down trees in the jungle to clear  a way for himself; or sometimes he has to do that to make an open  space where he can lie down comfortably. So this is the way Salar's  father taught him to break down trees.      _How Elephants Break Down or Pull Out Trees_    First he chose a small tree, not much thicker than your wrist; this he  pulled out easily with his trunk, just as you might use your hand to  pull out a small shrub. Then he chose a tree about six inches thick.  He tried it first carefully with his trunk; but the tree was too  strong to pull out in that way.    So the old elephant put his foot on the side of the tree, and pressed  with all his weight--as you see in the picture. The tree bent more and  more, and then suddenly broke off near the ground with a loud crack.    \"I can do that!\" cried Salar, frisking around his father, impatient to  show what _he_ could do.    Salar looked around and saw a tree of about the same size. He made a  dash at the tree, put his right foot on it, and--    His father winked, but said nothing. For all elephants love a joke.    Now the wily old elephant knew that this tree was a banana tree,  although the fruit had not yet started growing on it. The tree looked  quite hard and strong, but it was really very soft and easy to break,  like all banana trees. But Salar did not know that yet!    [Illustration: An Elephant Breaking a Tree with his Foot]    Instead, when he pressed on it with his foot and put his whole weight  on it, just as he had seen his father do to the other tree,--snap went  the tree like a twig, and Salar tumbled head over heels and went  rolling over the ground.    \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\" laughed the merry old elephant. \"Did I not show you,  silly, how to try it first carefully, with your trunk, before putting  your foot on it?\"    \"Of course you did!\" Salar said, remembering.    \"That is what men folks mean when they say, 'You have put your foot  into it.' You must remember _never to put your foot into anything  before trying it first with your trunk_,\" the old elephant went on to  say. \"Now watch me knock down a still bigger tree.\"    This tree was as thick as a man's body. After trying it first with his  trunk and then with his foot, the wise old elephant put his back on it  and _heaved_. Little by little the tree bent on that side, but not  very much. The elephant stopped heaving, came around and looked at the  tree. Then he began to heave from the _other_ side of the tree.    You have seen a man trying to loosen a nail from a board? He first  hits the nail on one side, and then on the other side; and he goes on  hitting the nail from side to side, till it is quite loose.    Well, that cunning old elephant did just the same thing to that tree;  he first heaved the tree from one side, and then he heaved from the  other"]]]
