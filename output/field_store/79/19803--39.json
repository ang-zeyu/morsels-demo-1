[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#5)"],[1,"to Emilio Agramonte, one of MacDowell's first  prophets, and one of the earliest and most active agents for the  recognition of the American composer.    In the lyrics in opus 56 and opus 58 MacDowell has turned song to the  unusual purposes of a landscape impressionism of places and moods  rather than people.    For men's voices there are some deftly composed numbers curiously  devoted to lullaby subjects. The barcarolle for mixed chorus and  accompaniment on the piano for four hands obtains a wealth of color,  enhanced by the constant division of the voices.    Studying as he did with Raff, it is but natural that MacDowell should  have been influenced strongly toward the poetic and fantastic and  programmatic elements that mark the \"Forest Symphony\" and the \"Lenore  Overture\" of his master.    It is hard to say just how far this descriptive music can go. The  skill of each composer must dictate his own limits. As an example of  successful pieces of this kind, consider MacDowell's \"The Eagle.\" It  is the musical realization of Tennyson's well-known poem:        \"He clasps the crag with crooked hands;      Close to the sun in lonely lands,      Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.      The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;      He watches from his mountain walls,      And like a thunderbolt he falls.\"    Of course the crag and the crooked hands and the azure world must be  granted the composer, but general exaltation and loneliness are  expressed in the severe melody of the opening. The wrinkling and  crawling of the sea far below are splendidly achieved in the soft,  shimmering liquidity of the music. Then there are two abrupt, but  soft, short chords that will represent, to the imaginative, the quick  fixing of the eagle's heart on some prey beneath; and there follows a  sudden precipitation down the keyboard, _fortississimo_, that  represents the thunderous swoop of the eagle with startling effect.    On the other hand, the \"Moonshine\" seems to be attempting too much.  \"Winter\" does better, for it has a freezing stream, a mill-wheel, and  a \"widow bird.\" These \"four little poems\" of opus 32 had been preceded  by six fine \"Idylls\" based on lyrics of Goethe's. The first, a forest  scene, has a distinct flavor of the woods, the second is all laziness  and drowsiness, and the third is moonlight mystery. The fourth is as  intense in its suppressed spring ecstasy as the radiant poem itself  singing how        \"Soft the ripples spill and hurry      To the opulent embankment.\"    The six short \"Poems\" (op. 31) based on poems of Heine's are  particularly successful, especially in the excellent opportunity of  the lyric describing the wail of the Scottish woman who plays her harp  on the cliff, and sings above the raging of sea and wind. The third  catches most happily the whimsicality of the poet's reminiscences of  childhood, but hardly, I think, the contrasting depth and wildness of  his complaint that, along with childhood's games, have vanished Faith  and Love and Truth. In the last, however, the cheery majesty that  realizes Heine's likening of Death to a cool night after the sultry  day of Life, is superb.    Then there are some four-hand pieces, two collections, that leave no  excuse for clinging to the hackneyed classics or modern trash. They  are not at all difficult, and the second player has something to  employ his mind besides accompanying chords. They are meaty, and  effective almost to the point of catchiness. The \"Tale of the Knights\"  is full of chivalric fire and martial swing, while the \"Ballad\" is as  exquisitely dainty as a peach-blossom. The \"Hindoo Maiden\" has a deal  of the thoroughly Oriental color and feeling that distinguish the  three solos of \"Les Orientales,\" of which \"Clair de Lune\" is one of  his most original and graceful writings. The duet, \"In Tyrol,\" has a  wonderful crystal carillon and a quaint shepherd piping a faint  reminiscence of the Wagnerian school of shepherds. This is one of a  series of \"Moon Pictures\" for four hands, based on Hans Christian  Andersen's lore. Two concertos for piano and orchestra are dazzling  feats of virtuosity; one of them is reviewed at length in A.J.  Goodrich' book, \"Musical Analysis.\" He has written also a book of  artistic moment called \"Twelve Virtuoso-Studies,\" and two books of  actual gymnastics for piano practice.    [Music: CLAIR DE LUNE.        La lune etait sereine et jouait sur les flots.      La fenetre enfin libre est ouverte a la brise;      La sultane regarde, et la mer qui se brise,      La-bas, d'un flot d'argent brode les noir ilots.                   (Victor Hugo, \"Les Orientales.\")    E.A. MACDOWELL, Op. 37, No. 1.    Copyright, 1889, Arthur P. Schmidt.]    But MacDowell did not reach his freedom without a struggle against  academia. His opus 10 is a piano suite published at the age of  twenty-two, and opus 14 is another; both contain such obsolescences as  a presto, fugue, scherzino, and the like. But for all the classic  garb, the hands are the hands of Esau. In one of the pieces there is  even a motto tucked, \"All hope leave ye behind who enter here!\" Can he  have referred to the limbo of classicism?    It is a far cry from these to the liberality that inspired the new  impressionism of \"Woodland Sketches\" (op. 51) and \"Sea Pieces\" (op.  55), in which he gives a legitimate musical presentation of a faintly  perfumed \"Wild Rose\" or \"Water Lily,\" but goes farther, and paints,  with wonderful tone, the moods inspired by reverie upon the uncouth  dignity and stoic savagery of \"An Indian Lodge,\" the lonely New  England twilight of \"A Deserted Farm,\" and all the changing humors of  the sea, majesty of sunset or star-rise, and even the lucent emerald  of an iceberg. His \"From Uncle Remus\" is not so successful; indeed,  MacDowell is not sympathetic with negro music, and thinks that if we  are to found a national school on some local manner, we should find  the Indian more congenial than the lazy, sensual slave.    He has carried this belief into action, not only by his scientific  interest in the collection and compilation of the folk-music of our  prairies, but by his artistic use of actual Indian themes in one of  his most important works, his \"Indian Suite\" for full orchestra, a  work that has been often performed, and always with the effect of a  new and profound sensation, particularly in the case of the deeply  impressive dirge.    A proof of the success of MacDowell as a writer in the large forms is  the fact that practically all of his orchestral works are published  in Germany and here, not only in full score, but in arrangement for  four hands. They include \"Hamlet;\" \"Ophelia\" (op. 22); \"Launcelot and  Elaine\" (op. 26), with its strangely mellow and varied use of horns  for Launcelot, and the entrusting of the plaintive fate of \"the lily  maid of Astolat\" to the string and wood-wind choirs; \"The Saracens\"  and \"The Lovely Alda\" (op. 30), two fragments from the Song of Roland;  and the Suite (op. 42), which has been played at least eight times in  Germany and eleven times here.    The first movement of this last is called \"In a Haunted Forest.\" You  are reminded of Siegfried by the very name of the thing, and the music  enforces the remembrance somewhat, though very slightly.    Everything reminds one of Wagner nowadays,--even his predecessors.  Rudyard Kipling has by his individuality so copyrighted one of the  oldest verse-forms, the ballad, that even \"Chevy Chace\" looks like an  advance plagiarism. So it is with Wagner. Almost all later music, and  much of the earlier, sounds Wagnerian. But MacDowell has been reminded  of Bayreuth very infrequently in this work. The opening movement  begins with a _sotto voce_ syncopation that is very presentative of  the curious audible silence of a forest. The wilder moments are  superbly instrumented.    The second movement, \"Summer Idyl,\" is delicious, particularly in the  chances it gives the flautist. There is a fragmentary cantilena which  would make the fortune of a comic opera. The third number, \"In  October,\" is particularly welcome in our music, which is strangely and  sadly lacking in humor. There is fascinating wit throughout this  harvest revel. \"The Shepherdess' Song\" is the fourth movement. It is  not precieuse, and it is not banal; but its simplicity of pathos is a  whit too simple. The final number, \"Forest Spirits,\" is a brilliant  climax. The Suite as a whole is an important work. It has detail of  the most charming art. Best of all, it is staunchly individual. It is  MacDowellian.    While the modern piano sonata is to me anathema as a rule, there are  none of MacDowell's works that I like better than his writings in this  form. They are to me far the best since Beethoven, not excepting even  Chopin's (_pace_ his greatest prophet, Huneker). They seem to me to be  of such stuff as Beethoven would have woven had he known in fact the  modern piano he saw in fancy.    The \"Sonata Tragica\" (op. 45) begins in G minor, with a bigly  passionate, slow introduction (metronomed in the composer's copy,  [quarter-note]-50). The first subject is marked in the same copy,  though not in the printed book, [half-note]-69, and the appealingly  pathetic second subject is a little slower. The free fantasy is full  of storm and stress, with a fierce pedal-point on the trilled  leading-tone. In the reprise the second subject, which was at first in  the dominant major, is now in the tonic major, though the key of the  sonata is G minor. The allegro is metronomed [quarter-note]-138, and  it is very short and very wild. Throughout, the grief is the grief of  a strong soul; it never degenerates into whine. Its largo is like the  tread of an AEschylean _choros_, its allegro movements are wild with  anguish, and the occasional uplifting into the major only emphasizes  the sombre whole, like the little rifts of clearer harmony in  Beethoven's \"Funeral March on the Death of a Hero.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#5)"],[1,"oubt.  By far the majority of the young have, also, a general respect for the  good opinion of others, and the laws of the Creator.    Still, do not thousands and tens of thousands mistake, as I have  already intimated, in regard to what really promotes their own  happiness? Is there any certainty that the greatest happiness of a  _creature_ can be secured without consulting the will of the Creator?  And do not those young persons greatly err, who suppose that they can  secure a full amount, even of earthly blessings, without conforming,  with the utmost strictness, to those rules for conduct, which the Bible  and the Book of Nature, so plainly make known?    Too many young men expect happiness from wealth. This is their great  object of study and action, by night and by day. Not that they suppose  there is an inherent value in the wealth itself, but only that it will  secure the means of procuring the _happiness_ they so ardently desire.  But the farther they go, in the pursuit of wealth, for the sake of  happiness, especially if successful in their plans and business, the  more they forget their original purpose, and seek wealth for the _sake_  of wealth. To _get rich_, is their principal motive to action.    So it is in regard to the exclusive pursuit of sensual pleasure, or  civil distinction. The farther we go, the more we lose our original  character, and the more we become devoted to the objects of pursuit,  and incapable of being roused by other motives.    The laws of God, whether we find them in the constitution of the  universe around us, or go higher and seek them in the revealed word,  are founded on a thorough knowledge of human nature, and all its  tendencies. Do you study natural science--the laws which govern matter,  animate and inanimate? What is the lesson which it constantly  inculcates, but that it is man's highest interest not to violate or  attempt to violate the rules which Infinite Wisdom has adopted; and  that every violation of his laws brings punishment along with it? Do  you study the laws of God, as revealed in the Bible? And do not they,  too, aim to inculcate the necessity of constant and endless obedience  to his will, at the same time that their rejection is accompanied by  the severest penalties which heaven and earth can inflict? What, in  short, is the obvious design of the Creator, wherever and whenever any  traces of his character and purposes can be discovered? What, indeed,  but to show us that it is our most obvious duty and interest to love  and obey Him?    The young man whose highest motives are to seek his own happiness, and  please his friends and neighbors, and the world around him, does much.  This should never be denied. He merits much--not in the eye of God, for  of this I have nothing to say in this volume--but from his fellow men.  And although he may have never performed a single action from a desire  to obey God, and make his fellow men really _better_, as well as  happier, he may still have been exceedingly useful, compared with a  large proportion of mankind.    But suppose a young man possesses a character of this stamp--and such  there are. How is he ennobled, how is the dignity of his nature  advanced, how is he elevated from the rank of a mere companion of  creatures,--earthly creatures, too,--to that of a meet companion and  fit associate for the inhabitants of the celestial world, and the  Father of all; when to these traits, so excellent and amiable in  themselves, is joined the pure and exalted desire to pursue his studies  and his employments, his pleasures and his pastimes--in a word, every  thing--even the most trifling concern which is _worth_ doing, exactly  as God would wish to have it done; and make the _means_ of so doing,  his great and daily study?    This, then, brings us to the highest of human motives to action, the  love of God. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God supremely, and thou shalt  love thy neighbor as thyself, are the two great commands which bind the  human family together. When our love to God is evinced by pure love to  man, and it is our constant prayer, 'Lord what wilt thou have me to  _do_;' then we come under the influence of motives which are worthy of  creatures destined to immortality. When it is our meat and drink, from  a sacred regard to the Father of our spirits, and of all things in the  universe, material and immaterial, to make every thought, word and  action, do good--have a bearing upon the welfare of one or more, and  the more the better--of our race, then alone do we come up to the  dignity of our nature, and, by Divine aid, place ourselves in the  situation for which the God of nature and of grace designed us.                         *      *      *      *      *    I have thus treated, at greater length than I had at first intended,  of the importance of having an _elevated aim_, and of the _motives  to action_. On the _means_ by which young men are to attain this  elevation, it is the purpose of this little work to dwell plainly and  fully. These _means_ might be classed in three great divisions; viz.  _physical_, _mental_, and _moral_. Whatever relates to the health,  belongs to the first division; whatever to the improvement of the mind,  the second; and the formation of good manners and virtuous habits,  constitutes the third. But although an arrangement of this sort might  have been more logical, it would probably have been less interesting to  the reader. The means of religious improvement, appropriately so  called, require a volume of themselves.      SECTION III. _Industry._    Nothing is more essential to usefulness and happiness in life, than  habits of industry. 'This we commanded you,' says St. Paul, 'that if  any would not work, neither should he eat.' Now this would be the sober  dictate of good sense, had the apostle never spoken. It is just as true  now as it was 2,000 years ago, that no person possessing a sound mind  in a healthy body, has a right to live in this world without labor. If  he claims an existence on any other condition, let him betake himself  to some other planet.    There are many kinds of labor. Some which are no less useful than  others, are almost exclusively mental. You may make your own selection  from a very wide range of employments, all, perhaps, equally important  to society. _But something you must do._ Even if you happen to inherit  an ample fortune, your health and happiness demand that you should  labor. To live in idleness, even if you have the means, is not only  injurious to yourself, but a species of fraud upon the community, and  the children,--if children you ever have,--who have a claim upon you  for what you can earn and do.    Let me prevail with you then, when I urge you to set out in life fully  determined to depend chiefly on yourself, for pecuniary support; and to  be in this respect, independent. In a country where the general rule is  that a person shall rise,--if he rise at all,--by his own merit, such a  resolution is indispensable. It is usually idle to be looking out for  support from some other quarter. Suppose you should obtain a place of  office or trust through the friendship, favor, or affection of others;  what then? Why, you hold your post at uncertainties. It may be taken  from you at almost any hour. But if you depend on yourself alone, in  this respect, your mountain stands strong, and cannot very easily be  moved.    He who lives upon any thing except his own labor, is incessantly  surrounded by rivals. He is in daily danger of being out-bidden; his  very bread depends upon caprice, and he lives in a state of never  ceasing fear. His is not, indeed, the dog's life, '_hunger_ and  idleness,' but it is worse; for it is 'idleness with _slavery_;' the  latter being just the price of the former.    Slaves, are often well _fed_ and decently _clothed_; but they dare not  _speak_. They dare not be suspected even to _think_ differently from  their master, despise his acts as much as they may;--let him be tyrant,  drunkard, fool, or all three at once, they must either be silent, or  lose his approbation. Though possessing a thousand times his knowledge,  they yield to his assumption of superior understanding; though knowing  it is they who, in fact, do all that he is paid for doing, it is  destruction to them to _seem as if they thought_ any portion of the  service belonged to themselves.    You smile, perhaps, and ask what all this tirade against slavery means.  But remember, there is slavery of several kinds. There is _mental_  slavery as well as bodily; and the former is not confined to any  particular division of the United States.    Begin, too, with a determination to labor through life. There are many  who suppose that when they have secured to themselves a competence,  they shall sit with folded arms, in an easy chair, the rest of their  days, and enjoy it. But they may be assured that this will never do.  The very fact of a person's having spent the early and middle part of  life in active usefulness, creates a necessity, to the body and mind,  of its continuance. By this is not meant that men should labor as  _hard_ in old age, even in proportion to their strength, as in early  life. Youth requires a great variety and amount of action, maturity not  so much, and age still less. Yet so much as age does, in fact, demand,  is more necessary than to those who are younger. Children are so  tenacious of life, that they do not _appear_ to _suffer immediately_,  if exercise is neglected; though a day of reckoning must finally come.    Hence we see the reason why those who retire from business towards the  close of life, so often become diseased, in body and mind; and instead  of enjoying life, or making those around them happy, become a source of  misery to themselves and others.    Most people have a general belief in the importance of industrious  habits; and yet not a few make strange work in endeavoring to form  them. Some"]]]
