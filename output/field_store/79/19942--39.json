A portion of the food aperture and the four brass  ferrules for conducting the water pipes and air pipes are shown. A  section of the zinc outside is shown in the lower part of the figure.]    A photograph taken subsequently, showing the inner copper lining in  position, is given in fig. 11.    The floor of the chamber is supported by 7 pieces of 2-1/2-inch channel  (N, N, N, fig. 8), laid on top and bolted to the two 3-inch channels (M,  fig. 8). On top of these is placed a sheet of so-called asbestos lumber  (J', fig. 8) 9.5 millimeters thick, cut to fit exactly the bottom of the  chamber. Upright 2-1/2-inch channels (H, fig. 8) are bolted to the two  outside channels on the bottom and to the ends of three of the long  channels between in such a manner as to form the skeleton of the walls.  The upper ends of these channels are fastened together by pieces of  piping (P, P, P, fig. 8) with lock-nuts on either side, thus holding the  whole framework in position.    The I-beams and channels used to tie the four upright channels at the  top form a substantial platform upon which is mounted a large balance  (fig. 9). This platform is anchored to the ceiling at four points by tie  rods and turn-buckles, shown in fig. 4. The whole apparatus, therefore,  is extremely rigid and the balance swings freely.    The top of the chamber is somewhat restricted near the edges (fig. 8)  and two lengths of 2-1/2-inch channel support the sides of the opening  through which the subject enters at the top (fig. 7).    Both the front and back lower channels upon which the bottom rests are  extended so as to provide for supports for the outer walls of asbestos  wood, which serve to insulate the calorimeter. Between the channels  beneath the calorimeter floor and the 3-inch channels is placed a sheet  of zinc which forms the outer bottom metallic wall of the chamber.    In order to prevent conduction of heat through the structural steel all  contact between the inner copper wall and the steel is avoided by having  strips of asbestos lumber placed between the steel and copper. These are  shown as J in fig. 8 and fig. 12. A sheet of asbestos lumber beneath the  copper bottom likewise serves this purpose and also serves to give a  solid foundation for the floor. The supporting channels are placed near  enough together to reinforce fully the sheet of asbestos lumber and  enable it to support solidly the weight of the man. The extra strain on  the floor due to tilting back a chair and thus throwing all the weight  on two points was taken into consideration in planning the asbestos and  the reinforcement by the steel channels. The whole forms a very  satisfactory flooring.    _Wall construction and insulation._--The inner wall of the chamber  consists of copper, preferably tinned on both sides, thus aiding in  soldering, and the tinned inner surface makes the chamber somewhat  lighter. Extra large sheets are obtained from the mill, thus reducing to  a minimum the number of seams for soldering, and seams are made tight  only with difficulty. The copper is of standard gage, the so-called  14-ounce copper, weighing 1.1 pounds per square foot or 5.5 kilograms  per square meter. It has a thickness of 0.5 millimeter. The whole  interior of the skeleton frame of the structural steel is lined with  these sheets; fig. 11 shows the copper shell in position.    For the outer metallic wall, zinc, as the less expensive metal, is used.  One sheet of this material perforated with holes for the attachment of  bolts and other appliances is shown in position on the outside of the  wall in fig. 11. The sheet zinc of the floor is obviously put in  position before the channels upon which it rests are laid. The zinc is  obtained in standard size, and is the so-called 9-ounce zinc, or 0.7  pound to the square foot, or 3.5 kilograms to the square meter. The  sheet has a thickness of 0.5 millimeter.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Cross-section in detail of walls of  calorimeter, showing zinc and copper walls and asbestos outside (A);  hair-felt lining (B); cross-section of channel iron (H); brass washer  soldered to copper (K); asbestos insulation between channel iron and  copper (J); bolt holding the whole together (I); heating wire (W) and  insulator holding it (F) shown in air-space between zinc and hair-felt;  section of one of the cooling pipes (C) and its brass support (G);  threaded rod (E) fastened into H at one end and passing through asbestos  wall with a nut on the outside; and iron pipe (D) used as spacer between  asbestos and zinc.]    In the cross-section, fig. 7, A represents the copper wall and B the  zinc wall. Surrounding this zinc wall and providing air insulation is a  series of panels constructed of asbestos lumber, very fire-resisting,  rigid, and light. The asbestos lumber used for these outer panels is 6.4  millimeters (0.25 inch) thick. To further aid in heat insulation we have  glued to the inner face of the different panels a patented material  composed of two layers of sheathing-paper inclosing a half-inch of  hair-felt. This material is commonly used in the construction of  refrigerators. This is shown as E in fig. 7, while the outer asbestos  panels are shown as F.    A detail of the construction of the walls, showing in addition the  heating and cooling devices, is given in fig. 12, in which the copper is  shown held firmly to the upright channel H by means of the bolt I,  screwing into a brass or copper disk K soldered to the copper wall. The  bolt I serves the purpose of holding the copper to the upright channel  and likewise by means of a washer under the head of the screw holds the  zinc to the channel. In order to hold the asbestos-lumber panel A with  the hair-felt lining B a threaded rod E is screwed into a tapped hole in  the outer part of the upright channel H. A small piece of brass or iron  tubing, cut to the proper length, is slipped over this rod and the  asbestos lumber held in position by a hexagonal nut with washer on the  threaded rod E. In this manner great rigidity of construction is  secured, and we have two air-spaces corresponding to the dead air-spaces  indicated in fig. 7, the first between the copper and zinc and the  second between the zinc and hair-felt.      PREVENTION OF RADIATION.    As can be seen from these drawings the whole construction of the  apparatus is more or less of the refrigerator type, _i. e._, there is  little opportunity for radiation or conduction of heat. Such a  construction could be multiplied a number of times, giving a greater  number of insulating walls, and perhaps reducing radiation to the  minimum, but for extreme accuracy in calorimetric investigations it is  necessary to insure the absence of radiation, and hence we have retained  the ingenious device of Rosa, by which an attempt is made arbitrarily to  alter the temperature of the zinc wall so that it always follows any  fluctuations in the temperature of the copper wall. To this end it is  necessary to know _first_ that there is a temperature difference between  zinc and copper and, _second_, to have some method for controlling the  temperature of the zinc. Leaving for a moment the question of measuring  the temperature differences between zinc and copper, we can consider  here the methods for controlling the temperature of the zinc wall.    If it is found necessary to warm the zinc wall, a current of electricity  is passed through the resistance wire W, fig. 12. This wire is  maintained approximately in the middle of the air-space between the zinc  wall and hair-felt by winding it around an ordinary porcelain insulator  F, held in position by a threaded rod screwed into a brass disk soldered  to the zinc wall. A nut on the end of the threaded rod holds the  insulator in position. Much difficulty was had in securing a resistance  wire that would at the same time furnish reasonably high resistance and  would not crystallize or become brittle and would not rust. At present  the best results have been obtained by using enameled manganin wire. The  wire used is No. 28 American wire-gage and has resistance of  approximately 1.54 ohms per foot. The total amount of wire used in any  one circuit is equal to a resistance of approximately 92 ohms. This  method of warming the air-space leaves very little to be desired. It can  be instantaneously applied and can be regulated with the greatest ease  and with the greatest degree of refinement.    If, on the other hand, it becomes necessary to cool the air-space next  to the zinc and in turn cool the zinc, we must resort to the use of cold  water, which is allowed to flow through the pipe C suspended in the  air-space between the zinc and hair-felt at approximately the same  distance as is the heating wire. The support of these pipes is  accomplished by placing them in brass hangers G, soldered to the zinc  and provided with an opening in which the pipe rests.    In the early experimenting, it was found impracticable to use piping of  very small size, as otherwise stoppage as a result of sediment could  easily occur. The pipe found best adapted to the purpose was the  so-called standard one-eighth inch brass pipe with an actual internal  diameter of 7 millimeters. The opening of a valve allowed cold water to  flow through this pipe and the considerable mass of water passing  through produced a very noticeable cooling effect. In the attempt to  minimize the cooling effect of the mass of water remaining in the pipe,  provision was made to allow water to drain out of this pipe a few  moments after the valve was closed by a system of check-valves. In  building the new apparatus, use was made of the compressed-air service  in the laboratory to remove the large mass of cold water in the pipe. As  soon as the water-valve was closed and the air-cock opened, the  compressed air blew all of the water out of the tube.

Est igitur systematis corporum plurium Lex eadem  quæ corporis solitarii, quoad perseverantiam in statu motus vel quietis.  Motus enim progressivus seu corporis solitarii seu systematis corporum ex  motu centri gravitatis æstimari semper debet.    Corol.

Per leges duas primas & Corollaria duo prima adinvenit  _Galilæus_ descensum gravium esse in duplicata ratione temporis, & motum  projectilium fieri in Parabola, conspirante experientia, nisi quatenus  motus illi per aeris resistentiam aliquantulum retardantur. Ab ijsdem  Legibus & Corollariis pendent demonstrata de temporibus oscillantium  Pendulorum, suffragante Horologiorum experientia quotidiana. Ex his ijsdem  & Lege tertia _D. Christopherus Wrennus_ Eques auratus, _Johannes Wallisius  S.T.D._ & _D. Christianus Hugenius_, hujus ætatis Geometrarum facile  Principes, regulas congressuum & reflexionum duorum corporum seorsim  adinvenerunt, & eodem fere tempore cum _Societate Regia_ communicarunt,  inter se (quoad has leges) omnino conspirantes; Et primus quidem _D.  Wallisius_ dein _D. Wrennus_ & _D. Hugenius_ inventum prodidit. Sed &  veritas comprobata est a _D. Wrenno_ coram _Regia Societate_ per  experimentum Pendulorum, quod etiam _Clarissimus Mariottus_ Libro integro  exponere mox dignatus est. Verum ut hoc experimentum cum Theorijs ad  amussim congruat, habenda est ratio tum resistentiæ aeris, tum etiam vis  Elasticæ concurrentium corporum. Pendeant corpora A, B filis parallelis AC,  BD a centris C, D. His centris & intervallis describantur semicirculi EAF,  GBH radijs CA, DB bisecti. Trahatur corpus A ad arcus EAF punctum quodvis  R, & (subducto corpore B) demittatur inde, redeatq; post unam oscillationem  ad punctum V. Est RV retardatio ex resistentia aeris. Hujus RV fiat ST pars  quarta sita in medio, & hæc exhibebit retardationem in descensu ab S ad A  quam proxime. Restituatur corpus B in locum suum. Cadat corpus A de puncto  S, & velocitas ejus in loco reflexionis A, absq; errore sensibili, tanta  erit ac si in vacuo cecidisset de loco T. Exponatur igitur hæc velocitas  per chordam arcus TA. Nam velocitatem Penduli in puncto infimo esse ut  chorda arcus quem cadendo descripsit, Propositio est Geometris notissima.  Post reflexionem perveniat corpus A ad locum s, & corpus B ad locum k.  Tollatur corpus B & inveniatur locus v, a quo si corpus A demittatur & post  unam oscillationem redeat ad locum r, sit st pars quarta ipsius rv sita in  medio, & per chordam arcus tA exponatur velocitas quam corpus A proxime  post reflexionem habuit in loco A. Nam t erit locus ille verus & correctus  ad quem corpus A, sublata aeris resistentia, ascendere debuisset. Simili  methodo corrigendus erit locus k, ad quem corpus B ascendit, & inveniendus  locus l, ad quem corpus illud ascendere debuisset in vacuo. Hoc pacto  experiri licet omnia perinde ac si in vacuo constituti essemus. Tandem  ducendum erit corpus A in chordam arcus TA (quæ velocitatem ejus exhibet)  ut habeatur motus ejus in loco A proxime ante reflexionem, deinde in  chordam arcus tA ut habeatur motus ejus in loco A proxime post reflexionem.  Et sic corpus B ducendum erit in chordam arcus Bl, ut habeatur motus ejus  proxime post reflexionem. Et simili methodo ubi corpora duo simul  demittuntur de locis diversis, inveniendi sunt motus utriusq; tam ante,  quam post reflexionem; & tum demum conferendi sunt motus inter se &  colligendi effectus reflexionis. Hoc modo in Pendulis pedum decem rem  tentando, idq; in corporibus tam inæqualibus quam æqualibus, & faciendo ut  corpora de intervallis amplissimis, puta pedum octo, duodecim vel sexdecim  concurrerent, reperi semper sine errore trium digitorum in mensuris, ubi  corpora sibi mutuo directe occurrebant quod in partes contrarias mutatio  motus erat corpori utriq; illata, atq; adeo quod actio & reactio semper  erant æquales. Ut si corpus A incidebat in corpus B cum novem partibus  motus, & amissis septem partibus pergebat post reflexionem cum duabus,  corpus B resiliebat cum partibus istis septem. Si corpora obviam ibant, A  cum duodecim partibus & B cum sex & redibat A cum duabus, redibat B cum  octo, facta detractione partium quatuordecim utrinque. De motu ipsius A  subducantur partes duodecim & restabit nihil; subducantur aliæ partes duæ &  fiet motus duarum partium in plagam contrariam. & sic de motu corporis B  partium sex subducendo partes quatuordecim, fiunt partes octo in plagam  contrariam. Quod si corpora ibant ad eandem plagam, A velocius cum partibus  quatuordecim & B tardius cum partibus quinq; & post reflexionem pergebat A  cum quinq; partibus, pergebat B cum quatuordecim, facta translatione  partium novem de A in B. Et sic in reliquis. A congressu & collisione  corporum nunquam mutabatur quantitas motus quæ ex summa motuum  conspirantium & differentia contrariorum colligebatur. Namq; errorem digiti  unius & alterius in mensuris tribuerim difficultati peragendi singula satis  accurate. Difficile erat tum pendula simul demittere sic, ut corpora in se  mutuo impingerent in loco infimo AB, tum loca s, k, notare ad quæ corpora  ascendebant post concursum. Sed & in ipsis pilis inæqualis partium  densitas, & textura aliis de causis irregularis, errores inducebant.    Porro nequis objiciat Regulam ad quam probandam inventum est hoc  experimentum præsupponere corpora vel absolute dura esse, vel saltem  perfecte elastica, cujusmodi nulla reperiuntur in compositionibus  naturalibus; addo quod experimenta jam descripta succedunt in corporibus  mollibus æque ac in duris, nimirum a conditione duritiei neutiquam  pendentia. Nam si conditio illa in corporibus non perfecte duris tentanda  est, debebit solummodo reflexio minui in certa proportione pro quantitate  vis Elasticæ. In Theoria _Wrenni_ & _Hugenij_ corpora absolute dura redeunt  ab invicem cum velocitate congressus. Certius id affirmabitur de perfecte  Elasticis. In imperfecte Elasticis velocitas reditus minuenda est "]]]
