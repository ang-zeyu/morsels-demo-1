[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25140"],[0,"Indian Story and Song, from North America (#5)"],[1,"a warrior, who died the death of a warrior. There was joy in  his voice!\"    The men to whom the strange experience narrated in this story came,  afterward banded themselves together in order the better to serve  their people, to present to the young men of the tribe an example of  generosity in time of peace and of steadfast valour on the field of  battle. They kept together during their lives and added to their  number, so that the society they formed continued to exist through  generations.    The story and song which has been handed down through all these years  as the inspiration of the founders of the Ma-wa'-da-ni Society,  embodies a truth honoured among all peoples,--that death cannot  silence the voice of one who confronts danger with unflinching  courage, giving his life in the defence of those dependent upon his  prowess. Such a man might fall in the trackless wilderness, and his  bones lie unhonoured and unburied until they blanched with age: still  his voice would ring out in the solitude until its message of courage  and joy should find an echo in the heart of the living.          STORY AND SONG OF ZO_N_-ZI'-MO_N_-DE.      Victory songs, of which this is one, were sung when the people with  rhythmic steps celebrated ceremonially the return of victorious  warriors. Because of its peculiar accessory, the scalp, this ceremony  has been called by us the \"scalp dance,\" although no Indian so  designates it.    The contrast between the sentiment of this story, teaching respect and  honour to the old, and the ceremony, as we baldly see it, is  startling. But it is with the Indian as with ourselves: the cruelties  of war and the gentler emotions are often intertwined, the latter  surviving and lifting up a standard for emulation, the former passing  away, dying with the instigating passion. Among the many hundreds of  Indian songs I have known, none commemorate acts of cruelty.    Years ago the Omaha tribe and the Sioux met while searching for a  buffalo herd; and, as was usual, a battle ensued, for each tribe was  determined to drive the other from the region of the game. Although  the Sioux outnumbered the Omaha, the latter remained victors of the  field.    [Music: ZO_N_-ZI-MO_N_-DE.    _Omaha._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.    Ye ha he ya e he dha ye ha he  ya e he dha ah ha ya e he dha ye ha he  ya e he dha dha ha dhoe.  Zo_n_-zi-mo_n_-de a-ma sha e dhe.  Ah ha ya e he dha e ha he ya e ha dha dha ha dho.]    An old Omaha, interested to observe how some of the tribe would  conduct themselves in their first battle, made his way toward the  scene of conflict. It chanced that just as a Sioux warrior had fallen,  pierced by an arrow, and the Omaha men were rushing forward to secure  their war honours, this old man was discovered coming up the hill,  aided by his bow, which he used as a staff. One of the young warriors  called to his companions:--    \"Hold! Yonder comes Zo_n_-zi'-mo_n_-de, let us give him the honours.\"    Then, out of courtesy to the veteran, each young warrior paused and  stepped aside, while the old man, all out of breath, hastened to the  fallen foe. There he turned and thanked the young men for permitting  him, whom age had brought to the edge of the grave, to count yet one  more honour as a warrior.[5]    [Footnote 5: To be the first to touch the body of an enemy counts as a  war honour.]    The words of the song give the exclamation of the generous youth:  \"Zo_n_-zi'-mo_n_-de comes! Stand aside! He comes.\"          AN OMAHA LOVE-SONG.      The words of many love-songs refer to the dawn, the time of the day  when they are usually sung; but this reference is not a literal one.  It figures the dawn of love in the breast of the singer. The Indian  stands so close to Nature that he sees his own moods reflected or  interpreted in hers.    The Indian words of this song, freely translated, are:--         As the day comes forth from night,         So I come forth to seek thee.       Lift thine eyes and behold him         Who comes with the day to thee.    [Music: LOVE SONG.    _Omaha._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.    Fades the star of morning,  West winds gently blow, gently blow, gently blow.  Soft the pine trees murmur,  Soft the waters flow,  Soft the waters flow,  Soft the waters flow.  Lift thine eyes, my maiden,  To the hill-top nigh.  Night and gloom will vanish  When the pale stars die,  When the pale stars die,  When the pale stars die.  Lift thine eyes, my maiden,  Hear thy lover's cry.]    Miss Edna Dean Proctor has rendered into charming verse the scene and  the feeling of the hour, giving us an Indian love-song in its  entirety. By her courtesy I am able to reproduce here her poem written  some years ago, on hearing the melody which I had then recently  transcribed during one of my sojourns among the Omaha Indians:--         Fades the star of morning,         West winds gently blow,       Soft the pine-trees murmur,         Soft the waters flow.         Lift thine eyes, my maiden,         To the hill-top nigh,       Night and gloom will vanish         When the pale stars die;       Lift thine eyes, my maiden,         Hear thy lover's cry!         From my tent I wander,         Seeking only thee,       As the day from darkness         Comes for stream and tree.       Lift thine eyes, my maiden,         To the hill-top nigh;       Lo! the dawn is breaking,         Rosy beams the sky;       Lift thine eyes, my maiden,         Hear thy lover's cry!         Lonely is our valley,         Though the month is May;       Come and be my moonlight,         I will be thy day!       Lift thine eyes, my maiden,         Oh, behold me nigh!       Now the sun is rising,         Now the shadows fly;       Lift thine eyes, my maiden,         Hear thy lover's cry!          THE STORY AND SONG OF THE WREN.[6]    [Footnote 6: Both story and song were recited to me by an old priest  of the rite, and were interpreted by Mr. James R. Murie.]      This little parable occurs in the ritual of a religious ceremony of  the Pawnee tribe. The song has no words, except a term for wren, the  vocables being intended only to imitate the notes of the bird,  nevertheless, one can trace, through the variation and repetition of  the musical motive, the movement of the gentle thoughts of the teacher  as given in the story which belongs to the song.    \"A priest went forth in the early dawn. The sky was clear. The grass  and wild flowers waved in the breeze that rose as the sun threw its  first beams over the earth. Birds of all kinds vied with each other,  as they sang their joy on that beautiful morning. The priest stood  listening. Suddenly, off at one side, he heard a trill that rose  higher and clearer than all the rest. He moved toward the place whence  the song came, that he might see what manner of bird it was that could  send farther than all the others its happy, laughing notes. As he came  near, he beheld a tiny brown bird with open bill, the feathers on its  throat rippling with the fervour of its song. It was the wren, the  smallest, the least powerful of birds, that seemed to be most glad  and to pour out in ringing melody to the rising sun its delight in  life.    \"As the priest looked, he thought: 'Here is a teaching for my people.  Every one can be happy, even the most insignificant can have his song  of thanks.'    \"So he made the story of the wren and sang it; and it has been handed  down from that day,--a day so long ago no man can remember the time.\"    [Music: SONG OF THE WREN.    _Pawnee._    Transcribed from Graphophone and harmonized by EDWIN S.

There was but one funeral song in the Omaha tribe, and this was only  sung to honour some man or woman who had been greatly respected by the  people.    What one would see, when this song was sung, was in violent contrast  to the character of the music. The blithe major strains suggest only  happiness. They hardly touch ground, so to speak, but keep their  flight up where the birds are flitting about in the sunshine; and, if  there are clouds in the blue sky, they are soft and fleecy, and cast  no shadows. Yet the men who sang this song were ranged in line before  the tent where the dead lay ready for burial. They had drawn the stem  of a willow branch through a loop of flesh cut on their left arm, and  their blood dripped upon the green leaves and fell in drops to the  ground.    The meaning of this strange spectacle and its musical accompaniment,  so apparently out of keeping, must be sought for in the beliefs of the  people. It was a drama touching two worlds.    The shedding of blood was to express how vital was the loss. This act,  visible to the mourners, was an exhibition of sympathy; but music  had power to reach the unseen world, so the song was for the spirit of  the dead, who could not see the lacerated singers, but could hear  them, as they sang to cheer him as he went forth, forced by death to  leave all who were dear to him.[7]    [Footnote 7: It was one of the customs of the Omahas to cease wailing  at a certain stage in the funeral ceremonies, that the departing  friend might not be distressed by the sounds of sorrow, as he left his  home behind him,--a custom founded on the same belief as that  expressed by this funeral song.]    The song was always sung in unison. The rhythm was accented by each  singer beating together two small willow sticks.    There are no words to the song, only vocables; and these belong to the  breathing or sighing class, indicative of emotion.    [Music: SONG TO THE SPIRIT.    _Omaha._    Harmonized by PROF. J.C.

The principle of contrast is as important as that of similarity. Because  the present life is so close to us, touching us at every point, we  cannot get away from it to see it as it really is. Nothing stands out  clearly or sharply as characteristic. In the study of past periods,  attention necessarily attaches itself to striking differences. Thus the  child gets a locus of imagination, through which he can remove himself  from the pressure of present surrounding circumstances and define them.    History is equally available in teaching the _methods_ of social  progress. It is commonly stated that history must be studied from the  standpoint of cause and effect. The truth of this statement depends upon  its interpretation. Social life is so complex and the various parts of  it are so organically related to one another and to the natural  environment, that it is impossible to say that this or that thing is the  cause of some other particular thing. But the study of history can  reveal the main instruments in the discoveries, inventions, new modes of  life, etc., which have initiated the great epochs of social advance; and  it can present to the child types of the main lines of social progress,  and can set before him what have been the chief difficulties and  obstructions in the way of progress. Once more this can be done only in  so far as it is recognized that social forces in themselves are always  the same,--that the same kind of influences were at work one hundred and  one thousand years ago that are now working,--and that particular  historical epochs afford illustration of the way in which the  fundamental forces work.    Everything depends, then, upon history being treated from a social  standpoint; as manifesting the agencies which have influenced social  development and as presenting the typical institutions in which social  life has expressed itself. The culture-epoch theory, while working in  the right direction, has failed to recognize the importance of treating  past periods with relation to the present,--as affording insight into  the representative factors of its structure; it has treated these  periods too much as if they had some meaning or value in themselves. The  way in which the biographical method is handled illustrates the same  point. It is often treated in such a way as to exclude from the child's  consciousness (or at least not sufficiently to emphasize) the social  forces and principles involved in the association of the masses of men.  It is quite true that the child is easily interested in history from the  biographical standpoint; but unless \"the hero\" is treated in relation to  the community life behind him that he sums up and directs, there is  danger that history will reduce itself to a mere exciting story. Then  moral instruction reduces itself to drawing certain lessons from the  life of the particular personalities concerned, instead of widening and  deepening the child's imagination of social relations, ideals, and  means.    It will be remembered that I am not making these points for their own  sake, but with reference to the general principle that when a study is  taught as a mode of understanding social life it has positive ethical  import. What the normal child continuously needs is not so much isolated  moral lessons upon the importance of truthfulness and honesty, or the  beneficent results that follow from a particular act of patriotism, as  the formation of habits of social imagination and conception.    I take one more illustration, namely, mathematics. This does, or does  not, accomplish its full purpose according as it is, or is not,  presented as a social tool. The prevailing divorce between information  and character, between knowledge and social action, stalks upon the  scene here. The moment mathematical study is severed from the place  which it occupies with reference to use in social life, it becomes  unduly abstract, even upon the purely intellectual side. It is presented  as a matter of technical relations and formulae apart from any end or  use. What the study of number suffers from in elementary education is  lack of motivation. Back of this and that and the other particular bad  method is the radical mistake of treating number as if it were an end in  itself, instead of the means of accomplishing some end. Let the child  get a consciousness of what is the use of number, of what it really is  for, and half the battle is won. Now this consciousness of the use of  reason implies some end which is implicitly social.    One of the absurd things in the more advanced study of arithmetic is the  extent to which the child is introduced to numerical operations which  have no distinctive mathematical principles characterizing them, but  which represent certain general principles found in business  relationships. To train the child in these operations, while paying no  attention to the business realities in which they are of use, or to the  conditions of social life which make these business activities  necessary, is neither arithmetic nor common sense. The child is called  upon to do examples in interest, partnership, banking, brokerage, and so  on through a long string, and no pains are taken to see that, in  connection with the arithmetic, he has any sense of the social realities  involved. This part of arithmetic is essentially sociological in its  nature. It ought either to be omitted entirely, or else be taught in  connection with a study of the relevant social realities. As we now  manage the study, it is the old case of learning to swim apart from the  water over again, with correspondingly bad results on the practical  side.    In concluding this portion of the discussion, we may say that our  conceptions of moral education have been too narrow, too formal, and too  pathological. We have associated the term ethical with certain special  acts which are labeled virtues and are set off from the mass of other  acts, and are still more divorced from the habitual images and motives  of the children performing them. Moral instruction is thus associated  with teaching about these particular virtues, or with instilling certain  sentiments in regard to them. The moral has been conceived in too  goody-goody a way. Ultimate moral motives and forces are nothing more or  less than social intelligence--the power of observing and comprehending  social situations,--and social power--trained capacities of control--at  work in the service of social interest and aims. There is no fact which  throws light upon the constitution of society, there is no power whose  training adds to social resourcefulness that is not moral.    I sum up, then, this part of the discussion by asking your attention to  the moral trinity of the school. The demand is for social intelligence,  social power, and social interests. Our resources are (1) the life of  the school as a social institution in itself; (2) methods of learning  and of doing work; and (3) the school studies or curriculum. In so far  as the school represents, in its own spirit, a genuine community life;  in so far as what are called school discipline, government, order, etc.,  are the expressions of this inherent social spirit; in so far as the  methods used are those that appeal to the active and constructive  powers, permitting the child to give out and thus to serve; in so far as  the curriculum is so selected and organized as to provide the material  for affording the child a consciousness of the world in which he has to  play a part, and the demands he has to meet; so far as these ends are  met, the school is organized on an ethical basis. So far as general  principles are concerned, all the basic ethical requirements are met.  The rest remains between the individual teacher and the individual  child.          THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT OF MORAL EDUCATION          V    THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT OF MORAL EDUCATION      So far we have been considering the make-up of purposes and results that  constitute conduct--its \"what.\" But conduct has a certain method and  spirit also--its \"how.\" Conduct may be looked upon as expressing the  attitudes and dispositions of an _individual_, as well as realizing  social results and maintaining the social fabric. A consideration of  conduct as a mode of individual performance, personal doing, takes us  from the social to the psychological side of morals. In the first place,  all conduct springs ultimately and radically out of native instincts and  impulses. We must know what these instincts and impulses are, and what  they are at each particular stage of the child's development, in order  to know what to appeal to and what to build upon. Neglect of this  principle may give a mechanical imitation of moral conduct, but the  imitation will be ethically dead, because it is external and has its  centre without, not within, the individual. We must study the child, in  other words, to get our indications, our symptoms, our suggestions. The  more or less spontaneous acts of the child are not to be thought of as  setting moral forms to which the efforts of the educator must  conform--this would result simply in spoiling the child; but they are  symptoms which require to be interpreted: stimuli which need to be  responded to in directed ways; material which, in however transformed a  shape, is the only ultimate constituent of future moral conduct and  character.    Then, secondly, our ethical principles need to be stated in  psychological terms because the child supplies us with the only means or  instruments by which to realize moral ideals. The subject-matter of the  curriculum, however important, however judiciously selected, is empty of  conclusive moral content until it is made over into terms of the  individual's own activities, habits, and desires. We must know what  history, geography, and mathematics mean in psychological terms,"]]]
