She was half dreaming as she listened for the  servant's footsteps, and the faint shadow of a shade of a thought came  over her, and she imagined dimly, for the quick moment of a dream,  another world where rapture was wine, where one wandered in a deep and  happy valley, and the moon was always rising red above the trees. She  was thinking of Hampstead, which represented to her the vision of the  world beyond the walls, and the thought of the heath led her away to  Bank Holidays, and then to Alice. There was not a sound in the house; it  might have been midnight for the stillness if the drawling cry of the  Sunday paper had not suddenly echoed round the corner of Edna Road, and  with it came the warning clank and shriek of the milkman with his pails.    Mrs. Darnell sat up, and wide awake, listened more intently. The girl  was evidently fast asleep, and must be roused, or all the work of the  day would be out of joint, and she remembered how Edward hated any fuss  or discussion about household matters, more especially on a Sunday,  after his long week's work in the City. She gave her husband an  affectionate glance as he slept on, for she was very fond of him, and so  she gently rose from the bed and went in her nightgown to call the maid.    The servant's room was small and stuffy, the night had been very hot,  and Mrs. Darnell paused for a moment at the door, wondering whether the  girl on the bed was really the dusty-faced servant who bustled day by  day about the house, or even the strangely bedizened creature, dressed  in purple, with a shiny face, who would appear on the Sunday afternoon,  bringing in an early tea, because it was her 'evening out.' Alice's hair  was black and her skin was pale, almost of the olive tinge, and she lay  asleep, her head resting on one arm, reminding Mrs. Darnell of a queer  print of a 'Tired Bacchante' that she had seen long ago in a shop window  in Upper Street, Islington. And a cracked bell was ringing; that meant  five minutes to eight, and nothing done.    She touched the girl gently on the shoulder, and only smiled when her  eyes opened, and waking with a start, she got up in sudden confusion.  Mrs. Darnell went back to her room and dressed slowly while her husband  still slept, and it was only at the last moment, as she fastened her  cherry-coloured bodice, that she roused him, telling him that the bacon  would be overdone unless he hurried over his dressing.    Over the breakfast they discussed the question of the spare room all  over again. Mrs. Darnell still admitted that the plan of furnishing it  attracted her, but she could not see how it could be done for the ten  pounds, and as they were prudent people they did not care to encroach on  their savings. Edward was highly paid, having (with allowances for extra  work in busy weeks) a hundred and forty pounds a year, and Mary had  inherited from an old uncle, her godfather, three hundred pounds, which  had been judiciously laid out in mortgage at 4-1/2 per cent. Their total  income, then, counting in Aunt Marian's present, was a hundred and  fifty-eight pounds a year, and they were clear of debt, since Darnell  had bought the furniture for the house out of money which he had saved  for five or six years before. In the first few years of his life in the  City his income had, of course, been smaller, and at first he had lived  very freely, without a thought of laying by. The theatres and  music-halls had attracted him, and scarcely a week passed without his  going (in the pit) to one or the other; and he had occasionally bought  photographs of actresses who pleased him. These he had solemnly burnt  when he became engaged to Mary; he remembered the evening well; his  heart had been so full of joy and wonder, and the landlady had  complained bitterly of the mess in the grate when he came home from the  City the next night. Still, the money was lost, as far as he could  recollect, ten or twelve shillings; and it annoyed him all the more to  reflect that if he had put it by, it would have gone far towards the  purchase of an 'Orient' carpet in brilliant colours. Then there had been  other expenses of his youth: he had purchased threepenny and even  fourpenny cigars, the latter rarely, but the former frequently,  sometimes singly, and sometimes in bundles of twelve for half-a-crown.  Once a meerschaum pipe had haunted him for six weeks; the tobacconist  had drawn it out of a drawer with some air of secrecy as he was buying a  packet of 'Lone Star.' Here was another useless expense, these  American-manufactured tobaccos; his 'Lone Star,' 'Long Judge,' 'Old  Hank,' 'Sultry Clime,' and the rest of them cost from a shilling to one  and six the two-ounce packet; whereas now he got excellent loose  honeydew for threepence halfpenny an ounce. But the crafty tradesman,  who had marked him down as a buyer of expensive fancy goods, nodded with  his air of mystery, and, snapping open the case, displayed the  meerschaum before the dazzled eyes of Darnell. The bowl was carved in  the likeness of a female figure, showing the head and _torso_, and the  mouthpiece was of the very best amber--only twelve and six, the man  said, and the amber alone, he declared, was worth more than that. He  explained that he felt some delicacy about showing the pipe to any but a  regular customer, and was willing to take a little under cost price and  'cut the loss.' Darnell resisted for the time, but the pipe troubled  him, and at last he bought it. He was pleased to show it to the younger  men in the office for a while, but it never smoked very well, and he  gave it away just before his marriage, as from the nature of the carving  it would have been impossible to use it in his wife's presence. Once,  while he was taking his holidays at Hastings, he had purchased a malacca  cane--a useless thing that had cost seven shillings--and he reflected  with sorrow on the innumerable evenings on which he had rejected his  landlady's plain fried chop, and had gone out to _flaner_ among the  Italian restaurants in Upper Street, Islington (he lodged in Holloway),  pampering himself with expensive delicacies: cutlets and green peas,  braised beef with tomato sauce, fillet steak and chipped potatoes,  ending the banquet very often with a small wedge of Gruyere, which cost  twopence. One night, after receiving a rise in his salary, he had  actually drunk a quarter-flask of Chianti and had added the enormities  of Benedictine, coffee, and cigarettes to an expenditure already  disgraceful, and sixpence to the waiter made the bill amount to four  shillings instead of the shilling that would have provided him with a  wholesome and sufficient repast at home. Oh, there were many other items  in this account of extravagance, and Darnell had often regretted his way  of life, thinking that if he had been more careful, five or six pounds a  year might have been added to their income.    And the question of the spare room brought back these regrets in an  exaggerated degree. He persuaded himself that the extra five pounds  would have given a sufficient margin for the outlay that he desired to  make; though this was, no doubt, a mistake on his part. But he saw  quite clearly that, under the present conditions, there must be no  levies made on the very small sum of money that they had saved. The rent  of the house was thirty-five, and rates and taxes added another ten  pounds--nearly a quarter of their income for house-room. Mary kept down  the housekeeping bills to the very best of her ability, but meat was  always dear, and she suspected the maid of cutting surreptitious slices  from the joint and eating them in her bedroom with bread and treacle in  the dead of night, for the girl had disordered and eccentric appetites.  Mr. Darnell thought no more of restaurants, cheap or dear; he took his  lunch with him to the City, and joined his wife in the evening at high  tea--chops, a bit of steak, or cold meat from the Sunday's dinner. Mrs.  Darnell ate bread and jam and drank a little milk in the middle of the  day; but, with the utmost economy, the effort to live within their means  and to save for future contingencies was a very hard one. They had  determined to do without change of air for at least three years, as the  honeymoon at Walton-on-the-Naze had cost a good deal; and it was on this  ground that they had, somewhat illogically, reserved the ten pounds,  declaring that as they were not to have any holiday they would spend the  money on something useful.    And it was this consideration of utility that was finally fatal to  Darnell's scheme. They had calculated and recalculated the expense of  the bed and bedding, the linoleum, and the ornaments, and by a great  deal of exertion the total expenditure had been made to assume the shape  of 'something very little over ten pounds,' when Mary said quite  suddenly--    'But, after all, Edward, we don't really _want_ to furnish the room at  all. I mean it isn't necessary. And if we did so it might lead to no end  of expense. People would hear of it and be sure to fish for invitations.  You know we have relatives in the country, and they would be almost  certain, the Mallings, at any rate, to give hints.'    Darnell saw the force of the argument and gave way. But he was bitterly  disappointed.    'It would have been very nice, wouldn't it?' he said with a sigh.    'Never mind, dear,' said Mary, who saw that he was a good deal cast  down. 'We must think of some other plan that will be nice and useful  too.'    She often spoke to him in that tone of a kind mother, though she was by  three years the younger.    'And now,' she said, 'I must get ready for church. Are you coming?'    Darnell said that he thought not. He usually accompanied his wife to  morning service, but that day he felt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25023"],[0,"The Biography of a Grizzly (#5)"],[1,"that could tear huge  slabs of rock from the mountain-side--what was even the deadly rifle to  them!                      *       *       *       *       *    When the man's partner came home that night he found him on the reddened  shanty floor. The bloody trail from outside and a shaky, scribbled note on  the back of a paper novel told the tale.        It was Wahb done it. I seen him by the spring and wounded him. I      tried to git on the shanty, but he ketched me. My God, how I      suffer!                                                         JACK.        [Illustration]    It was all fair. The man had invaded the Bear's country, had tried to take  the Bear's life, and had lost his own. But Jack's partner swore he would  kill that Bear.    He took up the trail and followed it up the canyon, and there bushwhacked  and hunted day after day. He put out baits and traps, and at length one day  he heard a _crash_, _clatter_, _thump_, and a huge rock bounded down a bank  into a wood, scaring out a couple of deer that floated away like  thistle-down. Miller thought at first that it was a land-slide; but he soon  knew that it was Wahb that had rolled the boulder over merely for the sake  of two or three ants beneath it.        [Illustration]    The wind had not betrayed him, so on peering through the bush Miller saw  the great Bear as he fed, favoring his left hind leg and growling sullenly  to himself at a fresh twinge of pain. Miller steadied himself, and thought,  \"Here goes a finisher or a dead miss.\" He gave a sharp whistle, the Bear  stopped every move, and, as he stood with ears acock, the man fired at his  head.    But at that moment the great shaggy head moved, only an infuriating scratch  was given, the smoke betrayed the man's place, and the Grizzly made savage,  three-legged haste to catch his foe.    Miller dropped his gun and swung lightly into a tree, the only large one  near. Wahb raged in vain against the trunk. He tore off the bark with his  teeth and claws; but Miller was safe beyond his reach. For fully four hours  the Grizzly watched, then gave it up, and slowly went off into the bushes  till lost to view. Miller watched him from the tree, and afterward waited  nearly an hour to be sure that the Bear was gone. He then slipped to the  ground, got his gun, and set out for camp. But Wahb was cunning; he had  only _seemed_ to go away, and then had sneaked back quietly to watch. As  soon as the man was away from the tree, too far to return, Wahb dashed  after him. In spite of his wounds the Bear could move the faster. Within a  quarter of a mile--well, Wahb did just what the man had sworn to do to  him.    Long afterward his friends found the gun and enough to tell the tale.    The claim-shanty on the Meteetsee fell to pieces. It never again was used,  for no man cared to enter a country that had but few allurements to offset  its evident curse of ill luck, and where such a terrible Grizzly was always  on the war-path.        [Illustration]              IV        [Illustration]      Then they found good gold on the Upper Meteetsee. Miners came in pairs and  wandered through the peaks, rooting up the ground and spoiling the little  streams--grizzly old men mostly, that had lived their lives in the mountain  and were themselves slowly turning into Grizzly Bears; digging and grubbing  everywhere, not for good, wholesome roots, but for that shiny yellow  sand that they could not eat; living the lives of Grizzlies, asking nothing  but to be let alone to dig.        [Illustration: \"'AIN'T HE AN AWFUL SIZE, THOUGH?'\"]    They seemed to understand Grizzly Wahb. The first time they met, Wahb  reared up on his hind legs, and the wicked green lightnings began to  twinkle in his small eyes. The elder man said to his mate:    \"Let him alone, and he won't bother you.\"    \"Ain't he an awful size, though?\" replied the other, nervously.    Wahb was about to charge, but something held him back--a something that had  no reference to his senses, that was felt only when they were still; a  something that in Bear and Man is wiser than his wisdom, and that points  the way at every doubtful fork in the dim and winding trail.        [Illustration]    Of course Wahb did not understand what the men said, but he did feel that  there was something different here. The smell of man and iron was there,  but not of that maddening kind, and he missed the pungent odor that even  yet brought back the dark days of his cubhood.    The men did not move, so Wahb rumbled a subterranean growl, dropped down on  his four feet, and went on.    Late the same year Wahb ran across the red-nosed Blackbear. How that Bear  did keep on shrinking! Wahb could have hurled him across the Graybull with  one tap now.        [Illustration]    But the Blackbear did not mean to let him try. He hustled his fat, podgy  body up a tree at a rate that made him puff. Wahb reached up nine feet from  the ground, and with one rake of his huge claws tore off the bark clear to  the shining white wood and down nearly to the ground; and the Blackbear  shivered and whimpered with terror as the scraping of those awful claws ran  up the trunk and up his spine in a way that was horribly suggestive.    What was it that the sight of that Blackbear stirred in Wahb? Was it  memories of the Upper Piney, long forgotten; thoughts of a woodland rich  in food?        [Illustration]    Wahb left him trembling up there as high as he could get, and without any  very clear purpose swung along the upper benches of the Meteetsee down to  the Graybull, around the foot of the Rimrock Mountain; on, till hours later  he found himself in the timber-tangle of the Lower Piney, and among the  berries and ants of the old times.    He had forgotten what a fine land the Piney was: plenty of food, no miners  to spoil the streams, no hunters to keep an eye on, and no mosquitoes or  flies, but plenty of open, sunny glades and sheltering woods, backed up by  high, straight cliffs to turn the colder winds.    There were, moreover, no resident Grizzlies, no signs even of passing  travelers, and the Blackbears that were in possession did not count.    Wahb was well pleased. He rolled his vast bulk in an old Buffalo-wallow,  and rearing up against a tree where the Piney Canyon quits the Graybull  Canyon, he left on it his mark fully eight feet from the ground.    In the days that followed he wandered farther and farther up among the  rugged spurs of the Shoshones, and took possession as he went. He found the  sign-boards of several Blackbears, and if they were small dead trees he  sent them crashing to earth with a drive of his giant paw. If they were  green, he put his own mark over the other mark, and made it clearer by  slashing the bark with the great pickaxes that grew on his toes.        [Illustration]    The Upper Piney had so long been a Blackbear range that the Squirrels had  ceased storing their harvest in hollow trees, and were now using the spaces  under flat rocks, where the Blackbears could not get at them; so Wahb found  this a land of plenty: every fourth or fifth rock in the pine woods was the  roof of a Squirrel or Chipmunk granary, and when he turned it over, if the  little owner were there, Wahb did not scruple to flatten him with his paw  and devour him as an agreeable relish to his own provisions.    And wherever Wahb went he put up his sign-board:                         Trespassers beware!    It was written on the trees as high up as he could reach, and every one  that came by understood that the scent of it and the hair in it were those  of the great Grizzly Wahb.        [Illustration]    If his Mother had lived to train him, Wahb would have known that a good  range in spring may be a bad one in summer. Wahb found out by years of  experience that a total change with the seasons is best. In the early  spring the Cattle and Elk ranges, with their winter-killed carcasses, offer  a bountiful feast. In early summer the best forage is on the warm  hillsides where the quamash and the Indian turnip grow. In late summer the  berry-bushes along the river-flat are laden with fruit, and in autumn the  pine woods gave good chances to fatten for the winter. So he added to his  range each year. He not only cleared out the Blackbears from the Piney and  the Meteetsee, but he went over the Divide and killed that old fellow that  had once chased him out of the Warhouse Valley. And, more than that, he  held what he had won, for he broke up a camp of tenderfeet that were  looking for a ranch location on the Middle Meteetsee; he stampeded their  horses, and made general smash of the camp. And so all the animals,  including man, came to know that the whole range from Frank's Peak to the  Shoshone spurs was the proper domain of a king well able to defend it, and  the name of that king was Meteetsee Wahb.        [Illustration]    Any creature whose strength puts him beyond danger of open attack is apt to  lose in cunning. Yet Wahb never forgot his early experience with the traps.  He made it a rule never to go near that smell of man and iron, and that was  the reason that he never again was caught.        [Illustration]    So he led his lonely life and slouched around on the mountains, throwing  boulders about like pebbles, and huge trunks like matchwood, as he sought  for his daily food. And every beast of hill and plain soon came to know  and fly in fear of Wahb, the one time hunted, persecuted Cub. And more than  one Blackbear paid with his life for the ill-deed of that other, long ago.  And many a cranky Bobcat flying before him took to a tree, and if that tree  were dead and dry, Wahb heaved it down, and tree and Cat alike were dashed  to bits. Even the proud-necked Stallion, leader of the mustang band,  thought well for once to yield the road. The great, grey Timberwolves, and  the Mountain Lions too, left their new kill and sneaked in sullen fear  aside when Wahb appeared. And if, as he hulked "]]]
