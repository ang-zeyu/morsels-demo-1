[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#5)"],[1," had failed to  do: it brought the every-day life of the British Colonist in South  Africa within the purview of the nation. Thanks to the Kimberley mines  the Cape ceased to be thought of as a country whose resources were  exclusively pastoral and agricultural.    The epoch of the next great divergence of opinion was a more hopeful  time from an Imperialist point of view. Lord Beaconsfield, who was the  first statesman to give practical expression to the belief that the  maintenance of empire was not inconsistent with the welfare of the  masses of the home population, was in power. British statesmen, and  the class from which British statesmen are drawn, had begun to study  Colonial questions in a more hopeful and intelligent spirit. Something  had been learnt, too, of the actual conditions of South Africa. And  yet it was at this epoch that what was, perhaps, the most ruinous of  all the divergences of opinion between Capetown and Downing Street  occurred.    [Sidenote: Sir Bartle Frere.]    When Sir Bartle Frere was sent out to South Africa to carry out a  definite scheme for the union of the Republics with the British  colonies in a federal system, British statesmen and the educated  classes in general had adopted the views expressed by Grey twenty  years before. Tardily they had learnt to recognise both the essential  unity of the Dutch population and the value of the country as an  industrial asset of the empire. But, in the meantime, the centre of  political power had shifted in England. The extension of the franchise  had placed the ultimate control of British policy in South Africa in  the hands of a class of electors who were, as yet, wholly uneducated  in the political and economic conditions of that country. The  divergence of opinion between the home and the local authority became  in this case wider than ever. In short, it was the will of the nation  that caused Frere to be arrested midway in the accomplishment of his  task, and gave a mandate in 1880 to the Liberal party to administer  South Africa upon the lines of a policy shaped in contemptuous  indifference of the profoundest convictions and most solemn warnings  of a great proconsul and most loyal servant of the Crown.    The facts of Frere's supersession and recall are notorious: the story  is too recent to need telling at length. We know now that, apart from  the actual discovery of the Witwatersrand gold-mines, all that he  foresaw and foretold has been realised in the events which culminated,  twenty years later, in the great South African War. The military power  which at that time (1877-80) stood in the way of South African unity  under the British flag was the Zulu people. The whole adult male  population of the tribe had been trained for war, and organised by  Ketshwayo into a fighting machine. With this formidable military  instrument at his command Ketshwayo proposed to emulate the sanguinary  career of conquest pursued by his grandfather Tshaka;[7] and he had  prepared the way for the half-subdued military Bantu throughout South  Africa to co-operate with him in a general revolt against the growing  supremacy of the white man. Frere removed this obstacle. But in doing  so he, or rather the general entrusted with the command of the  military operations, lost a British regiment at Isandlhwana. This  revelation of the strength of the Zulu army was, in fact, a complete  confirmation of the correctness of Frere's diagnosis of the South  African situation. His contention was that England must give evidence  of both her capacity and her intention to control the native  population of South Africa before she could reasonably ask the  republican Dutch to surrender their independence and reunite with the  British colonies in a federal system under the British flag. A native  power, organised solely for aggressive warfare against one of two  possible white neighbours, constituted therefore, in his opinion, not  only a perpetual menace to the safety of Natal, but an insuperable  obstacle to the effective discharge of a duty by the paramount Power,  the successful performance of which was a condition precedent to the  reunion of the European communities. The only point in dispute was the  question whether the powers of Ketshwayo's _impis_ had been  exaggerated. To this question the disaster of Isandlhwana returned an  emphatic \"No.\"             [Footnote 7: Chaka.]    [Sidenote: The recall of Frere.]    The divergence of opinion between Frere and Lord Beaconsfield's  cabinet was trivial as compared with the profound gulf which separated  his policy from the South African policy of Mr. Gladstone. After the  return of the Liberal party to power in the spring of 1880, Frere was  allowed to remain in office until August 1st, when he was recalled by  a telegraphic despatch. But, as Lord Kimberley pointed out to him,  there had been \"so much divergence\" between his views and those of the  Home Government that he would not have been allowed to remain at the  Cape, \"had it not been for the special reason that there was a  prospect of his being able materially to forward the policy of  confederation.\" This prospect, of course, had then been removed by the  failure of the Cape Government, on June 29th, to bring about the  conference of delegates from the several States, which was the initial  step towards the realisation of Lord Carnarvon's scheme of federal  union.    The vindication of Frere's statesmanship has been carried, by the  inexorable logic of events, far beyond the sphere of Blue-book  arguments. But it is impossible to read this smug despatch without  recalling the words which Mr. Krueger wrote to Mr. (now Lord) Courtney  on June 26th of the same year: \"The fall of Sir Bartle Frere will ...  be useful.... We have done our duty and used all legitimate influence  to cause the conference proposals to fail.\" That is to say, it was  known to these faithful confederates of that section of the Liberal  party of which Mr. Courtney was the head, that the Gladstone  Government had determined to recall Sir Bartle Frere three days before  \"the special reason\" for maintaining him at the Cape had disappeared.    [Sidenote: Frere's forecast.]    But what we are really concerned with is the nature of the opinions  upon the central question of South African administration which Frere  put forward at this critical period. With these before us, the most  elementary acquaintance with the events of the last ten years will  suffice to indicate the profound degree in which his knowledge of  South African conditions surpassed the knowledge of those who took  upon themselves to reverse his policy. What, above all, Frere realised  was, that a point had been reached at which the whole of South Africa  must be gathered under the British flag without delay. He had noted  the disintegrating influences at work in the Cape Colony and the  strength of the potential antagonism of the republican Dutch. The  annexation of the Transvaal was not his deed, nor did either the time  or the manner in which it was done command his approval. But he  asserted that British rule, once established there, must be maintained  at all costs. With this end in view, he urged that every  responsibility incurred by England in the act of annexation must be  fulfilled to the letter. Utilising the information which he had gained  by personal observation during his visit to the Transvaal in 1879, and  availing himself of the co-operation of President Brand, of the Free  State, and Chief Justice de Villiers, in the Cape Colony, he drafted a  scheme of administrative reform sufficient to satisfy the legitimate  aspirations of the Boers for self-government without endangering the  permanency of British rule. It included proposals for administrative  and financial reforms framed with a view of reducing the cost of  government to the lowest point consistent with efficiency, for the  reorganisation of the courts of law, for the survey of the proposed  railway line to Delagoa Bay, and full details of a system of  representative government. This measure he urged upon the Colonial  Office as one of immediate necessity, since it embodied the fulfilment  of the definite promises of an early grant of self-government made to  the Boers at the time of annexation.[8]             [Footnote 8: The receipt of the despatch in which these           valuable recommendations were made was not even acknowledged           by the Colonial Office. Frere himself gives the outlines of           his proposals in an article published in _The Nineteenth           Century_ for February, 1881.]    He recognised the value of Delagoa Bay as an essential factor in the  political and commercial system of a united South Africa, and he  earnestly recommended its acquisition by purchase from the Portuguese  Government. His perception of the extreme importance of satisfying all  legitimate claims of the Boers, and his acute realisation of the  danger of allowing the Transvaal to become a \"jumping-off ground\"  either for foreign powers or Afrikander Nationalists, are exhibited in  due relationship in a private memorandum which he wrote from the Cape  at the end of July, 1879:         \"Any reliance on mere force in the Transvaal must react       dangerously down here in the old colony, and convert the Dutch       Country party, now as loyal and prosperous a section of the       population as any under the Crown, into dangerous allies of the       small anti-English Republican party, who are for separation, thus       paralysing the efforts of the loyal English party now in power,       who aim at making the country a self-defending integral portion       of the British Empire. Further, any attempt to give back or       restore the Boer Republic in the Transvaal must lead to anarchy       and failure, and probably, at no distant period, to a vicious       imitation of some South American Republics, in which the more       uneducated and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#5)"],[1," beyond a doubt, above half-a-century ago; and the following  epitaph in the garden at Wilton House is a curious record of the  particulars:--                         Here lies Lupa,                Whose Grandmother was a Wolf,      Whose Father and Grandfather were Dogs, and whose             Mother was half Wolf and half Dog.           She died on the 16th of October, 1782,                       Aged 12 years.    Conclusive as this fact may appear, as proving the descent of the dog  from the wolf, it is not convincing, the dog having characters which  do not belong to the wolf.    The dog, for instance, guards property with strictest vigilance, which  has been entrusted to his charge; all his energies seem roused at  night, as though aware that that is the time when depredations are  committed. His courage is unbounded, a property not possessed by the  wolf: he appears never to forget a kindness, but soon loses the  recollection of an injury, if received from the hand of one he loves,  but resents it if offered by a stranger. His docility and mental  pliability exceed those of any other animal; his habits are social,  and his fidelity not to be shaken; hunger cannot weaken, nor old age  impair it. His discrimination is equal, in many respects, to human  intelligence. If he commits a fault, he is sensible of it, and shows  pleasure when commended. These, and many other qualities, which might  have been enumerated, are distinct from those possessed by the wolf.  It may be said that domestication might produce them in the latter.  This may be doubted, and is not likely to be proved; the fact is, the  dog would appear to be a precious gift to man from a benevolent  Creator, to become his friend, companion, protector, and the  indefatigable agent of his wishes. While all other animals had the  fear and dread of man implanted in them, the poor dog alone looked at  his master with affection, and the tie once formed was never broken to  the present hour.    It should also be mentioned, in continuation of my argument, that the  experiment of the wolf breeding with the dog is of no value, because  it has never been carried sufficiently far to prove that the progeny  would continue fertile _inter se_. The wolf has oblique eyes--the eyes  of dogs have never retrograded to that position. If the dog descended  from the wolf, a constant tendency would have been observed in the  former to revert to the original type or species. This is a law in all  other cross-breeds--but amongst all the varieties of dogs, this  tendency has not existed. I may also add, that as far as I have been  able to ascertain the fact, the number of teats of the female wolf  have never been known to vary. With respect to the dog, it is known  that they do vary, some having more, and others a less number.    Having thus brought forward such arguments as have occurred to me to  prove that the dog is a breed _sui generis_, I will give a few  anecdotes to show how different this animal is in his specific  character to the wolf, and that he has a natural tendency to  acknowledge man as his friend and protector, an instinct never shown  by the wolf.    In Ceylon there are a great number of what are called wild dogs, that  is, dogs who have no master, and who haunt villages and jungles,  picking up what food they are able to find. If you meet one of these  neglected animals, and only look at him with an expression of  kindness, from that moment he attaches himself to you, owns you for  his master, and will remain faithful to you for the remainder of his  life.    \"Man,\" says Burns, \"is the God of the dog; he knows no other; and see  how he worships him! With what reverence he crouches at his feet, with  what reverence he looks up to him, with what delight he fawns upon  him, and with what cheerful alacrity he obeys him!\"    Such is the animal which the brutality of man subjects to so much  ill-treatment; its character depends very much on that of his master,  kindness and confidence produce the same qualities in the dog, while  ill-usage makes him sullen and distrustful of beings far more brutal  than himself.    I have had many opportunities of observing how readily dogs comprehend  language, and how they are aware when they are the subject of  conversation. A gentleman once said in the hearing of an old and  favourite dog, who was at the time basking in the sun,--\"I must have  Ponto killed, for he gets old and is offensive.\" The dog slunk away,  and never came near his master afterwards. Many similar anecdotes  might be brought forward, but I will mention one which Captain Brown  tells us he received himself from Sir Walter Scott.    \"The wisest dog I ever had,\" said Sir Walter, \"was what is called the  bulldog terrier. I taught him to understand a great many words,  insomuch that I am positive that the communication betwixt the canine  species and ourselves might be greatly enlarged. Camp once bit the  baker, who was bringing bread to the family. I beat him, and explained  the enormity of his offence; after which, to the last moment of his  life, he never heard the least allusion to the story, in whatever  voice or tone it was mentioned, without getting up and retiring into  the darkest corner of the room, with great appearance of distress.  Then if you said, 'the baker was well paid,' or, 'the baker was not  hurt after all,' Camp came forth from his hiding-place, capered, and  barked, and rejoiced. When he was unable, towards the end of his life,  to attend me when on horseback, he used to watch for my return, and  the servant would tell him 'his master was coming down the hill, or  through the moor,' and although he did not use any gesture to explain  his meaning, Camp was never known to mistake him, but either went out  at the front to go up the hill, or at the back to get down to the  moor-side. He certainly had a singular knowledge of spoken language.\"  An anecdote from Sir Walter Scott must be always pleasing.    Mr. Smellie, in his \"Philosophy of Natural History,\" mentions a  curious instance of the intellectual faculty of a dog. He states that  \"a grocer in Edinburgh had one which for some time amused and  astonished the people in the neighbourhood. A man who went through the  streets ringing a bell and selling pies, happened one day to treat  this dog with a pie. The next time he heard the pieman's bell he ran  impetuously toward him, seized him by the coat, and would not suffer  him to pass. The pieman, who understood what the animal wanted, showed  him a penny, and pointed to his master, who stood at the street-door,  and saw what was going on. The dog immediately supplicated his master  by many humble gestures and looks, and on receiving a penny he  instantly carried it in his mouth to the pieman, and received his pie.  This traffic between the pieman and the grocer's dog continued to be  daily practised for several months.\"    The affection which some dogs show to their masters and mistresses is  not only very often surprising, but even affecting. An instance of  this lately occurred at Brighton. The wife of a member of the town  council at that place had been an invalid for some time, and at last  was confined to her bed. During this period she was constantly  attended by a faithful and affectionate dog, who either slept in her  room or outside her door. She died, was buried, and the dog followed  the remains of his beloved mistress to her grave. After the funeral  the husband and his friends returned to the house, and while they were  partaking of some refreshment the dog put its paws on his master's  arm, as if to attract his attention, looked wistfully in his face, and  then laid down and instantly expired.    In giving miscellaneous anecdotes in order to show the general  character of the dog, I may mention the following very curious one.    During a very severe frost and fall of snow in Scotland, the fowls did  not make their appearance at the hour when they usually retired to  roost, and no one knew what had become of them; the house-dog at last  entered the kitchen, having in his mouth a hen, apparently dead.  Forcing his way to the fire, the sagacious animal laid his charge down  upon the warm hearth, and immediately set off. He soon came again with  another, which he deposited in the same place, and so continued till  the whole of the poor birds were rescued. Wandering about the  stack-yard, the fowls had become quite benumbed by the extreme cold,  and had crowded together, when the dog observing them, effected their  deliverance, for they all revived by the warmth of the fire.    That dogs possess a faculty nearly allied to reason cannot, I think,  be doubted. Mr. Davy, in his \"Angler in the Lake District,\" (a  charming work), gives one or two anecdotes in proof of this.    When Mr. Davy was at Ceylon, the Governor of that Island, the late Sir  Robert Brownrigg, had a dog of more than ordinary sagacity. He always  accompanied his master, being allowed to do so, except on particular  occasions, such as going to church or council, or to inspect his  troops, when the Governor usually wore his sword; but when the dog saw  the sword girded on, he would only follow to the outer door. Without a  word being said, he would return and wait the coming back of his  master, patiently remaining up-stairs at the door of his private  apartment. So it is with respect to my own pet terrier, Phiz. When he  sees me putting on my walking-shoes, my great-coat, or hat, he is all  eagerness to accompany me, jumping about me and showing his joy. But  on Sundays it is very different. My shoes, great-coat or hat, may be  put on, but he remains perfectly resigned on the rug before the fire,  and never attempts or shows any inclination to follow me. Is the dog  guided in acting thus by instinct or reason?    Let me give another instance from Mr. Davy's work.    Once when he was fishing in the highlands of Scotland, he saw a party  of sportsmen, with their"]]]
