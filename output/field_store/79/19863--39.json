And so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year, Harold's  knowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his awe diminish.  When his  father had told him all about his visit to Normanstand and of the  invitation which had been extended to him there came first awe, then  doubt, then expectation.  Between Harold and his father there was love  and trust and sympathy.   The father's married love so soon cut short  found expression towards his child; and between them there had never been  even the shadow of a cloud.  When his father told him how pretty the  little Stephen was, how dainty, how sweet, he began to picture her in his  mind's eye and to be bashfully excited over meeting her.    His first glimpse of Stephen was, he felt, one that he never could  forget.  She had made up her mind that she would let Harold see what she  could do.  Harold could fly kites and swim and play cricket; she could  not do any of these, but she could ride.  Harold should see her pony, and  see her riding him all by herself.  And there would be another pony for  Harold, a big, big, big one--she had spoken about its size herself to  Topham, the stud-groom.  She had coaxed her daddy into promising that  after lunch she should take Harold riding.  To this end she had made  ready early.  She had insisted on putting on the red riding habit which  Daddy had given her for her birthday, and now she stood on the top of the  steps all glorious in hunting pink, with the habit held over her arms,  with the tiny hunting-hoots all shiny underneath.  She had no hat on, and  her beautiful hair of golden red shone in its glory.  But even it was  almost outshone by the joyous flush on her cheeks as she stood waving the  little hand that did not hold Daddy's.  She was certainly a picture to  dream of!  Her father's eyes lost nothing of her dainty beauty.  He was  so proud of her that he almost forgot to wish that she had been a boy.  The pleasure he felt in her appearance was increased by the fact that her  dress was his own idea.    During luncheon Stephen was fairly silent; she usually chattered all  through as freely as a bird sings.  Stephen was silent because the  occasion was important.  Besides, Daddy wasn't all alone, and therefore  had not to be cheered up.  Also--this in postscript form--Harold was  silent!  In her present frame of mind Harold could do no wrong, and what  Harold did was right.  She was unconsciously learning already a lesson  from his presence.    That evening when going to bed she came to say good-night to Daddy.  After  she had kissed him she also kissed 'old Mr. Harold,' as she now called  him, and as a matter of course kissed Harold also.  He coloured up at  once.  It was the first time a girl had ever kissed him.    The next day from early morning until bed-time was one long joy to  Stephen, and there were few things of interest that Harold had not been  shown; there were few of the little secrets which had not been shared  with him as they went about hand in hand.  Like all manly boys Harold was  good to little children and patient with them.  He was content to follow  Stephen about and obey all her behests.  He had fallen in love with her  to the very bottom of his boyish heart.    When the guests were going, Stephen stood with her father on the steps to  see them off.  When the carriage had swept behind the farthest point in  the long avenue, and when Harold's cap waving from the window could no  longer be seen, Squire Norman turned to go in, but paused in obedience to  the unconscious restraint of Stephen's hand.  He waited patiently till  with a long sigh she turned to him and they went in together.    That night before she went to bed Stephen came and sat on her father's  knee, and after sundry pattings and kissings whispered in his ear:    'Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?  Couldn't you ask him to?  And old Mr. Harold could come too.  Oh, I wish  he was here!'          CHAPTER IV--HAROLD AT NORMANSTAND      Two years afterwards a great blow fell upon Harold.  His father, who had  been suffering from repeated attacks of influenza, was, when in the low  condition following this, seized with pneumonia, to which in a few days  he succumbed.  Harold was heart-broken.  The affection which had been  between him and his father had been so consistent that he had never known  a time when it was not.    When Squire Norman had returned to the house with him after the funeral,  he sat in silence holding the boy's hand till he had wept his heart out.  By this time the two were old friends, and the boy was not afraid or too  shy to break down before him.  There was sufficient of the love of the  old generation to begin with trust in the new.    Presently, when the storm was past and Harold had become his own man  again, Norman said:    'And now, Harold, I want you to listen to me.  You know, my dear boy,  that I am your father's oldest friend, and right sure I am that he would  approve of what I say.  You must come home with me to live.  I know that  in his last hours the great concern of your dear father's heart would  have been for the future of his boy.  And I know, too, that it was a  comfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends, and that the son  of my dearest old friend would be as a son to me.  We have been friends,  you and I, a long time, Harold; and we have learned to trust, and I hope  to love, one another.  And you and my little Stephen are such friends  already that your coming into the house will be a joy to us all.  Why,  long ago, when first you came, she said to me the night you went away:  \"Daddy, wouldn't it be nice if Harold could come here altogether?\"'    And so Harold An Wolf came back with the Squire to Normanstand, and from  that day on became a member of his house, and as a son to him.  Stephen's  delight at his coming was of course largely qualified by her sympathy  with his grief; but it would have been hard to give him more comfort than  she did in her own pretty way.  Putting her lips to his she kissed him,  and holding his big hand in both of her little ones, she whispered  softly:    'Poor Harold!  You and I should love each other, for we have both lost  our mother.  And now you have lost your father.  But you must let my dear  daddy be yours too!'    At this time Harold was between fourteen and fifteen years old.  He was  well educated in so far as private teaching went.  His father had devoted  much care to him, so that he was well grounded in all the Academic  branches of learning.  He was also, for his years, an expert in most  manly exercises.  He could ride anything, shoot straight, fence, run,  jump or swim with any boy more than his age and size.    In Normanstand his education was continued by the rector.  The Squire  used often to take him with him when he went to ride, or fish, or shoot;  frankly telling him that as his daughter was, as yet, too young to be his  companion in these matters, he would act as her locum tenens.  His living  in the house and his helping as he did in Stephen's studies made  familiarity perpetual.  He was just enough her senior to command her  childish obedience; and there were certain qualities in his nature which  were eminently calculated to win and keep the respect of women as well as  of men.  He was the very incarnation of sincerity, and had now and again,  in certain ways, a sublime self-negation which, at times, seemed in  startling contrast to a manifestly militant nature.  When at school he  had often been involved in fights which were nearly always on matters of  principle, and by a sort of unconscious chivalry he was generally found  fighting on the weaker side.  Harold's father had been very proud of his  ancestry, which was Gothic through the Dutch, as the manifestly corrupted  prefix of the original name implied, and he had gathered from a constant  study of the Sagas something of the philosophy which lay behind the ideas  of the Vikings.    This new stage of Harold's life made for quicker development than any  which had gone before.  Hitherto he had not the same sense of  responsibility.  To obey is in itself a relief; and as it is an actual  consolation to weak natures, so it is only a retarding of the strong.  Now  he had another individuality to think of.  There was in his own nature a  vein of anxiety of which the subconsciousness of his own strength threw  up the outcrop.    Little Stephen with the instinct of her sex discovered before long this  weakness.  For it is a weakness when any quality can be assailed or used.  The using of a man's weakness is not always coquetry; but it is something  very like it.  Many a time the little girl, who looked up to and admired  the big boy who could compel her to anything when he was so minded,  would, for her own ends, work on his sense of responsibility, taking an  elfin delight in his discomfiture.    The result of Stephen's harmless little coquetries was that Harold had  occasionally either to thwart some little plan of daring, or else cover  up its results.  In either case her confidence in him grew, so that  before long he became an established fact in her life, a being in whose  power and discretion and loyalty she had absolute, blind faith.  And this  feeling seemed to grow with her own growth.  Indeed at one time it came  to be more than an ordinary faith.  It happened thus:    The old Church of St. Stephen, which was the parish church of  Normanstand, had a peculiar interest for the Norman family.  There,  either within the existing walls or those which had preceded them when  the church was rebuilt by that Sir Stephen who was standard-bearer to  Henry VI., were buried all the direct members of the line.  It was an  unbroken record of the inheritors since the first Sir Stephen, who had  his place in the Domesday Book.  Without, in the churchyard close to the  church, were buried "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#5)"],[1,"e's phrase, the cackling geese would drown the song of  the nightingale. And this craving for stimulus is the fruit of weakness,  coming from the failure to find strength in the primal life of the  spiritual man.    Attachment is but another name for psychic self-absorption; for we are  absorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images within our  minds; our inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over  them; and em we blind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner' the  enmeshed and fettered spiritual man.    4. The darkness of unwisdom is the field of the others. These  hindrances may be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded.    Here we have really two Sutras in one. The first has been explained  already: in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust,  attachment. They are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the  psychical self.    Next, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or  suspended, or expanded, or worn thin. Faults which are dormant will  be brought out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of  strong aspiration. Thus expanded, they must be fought and conquered,  or, as Patanjali quaintly says, they must be worn thin,-as a veil might,  or the links of manacles.    5 The darkness of ignorance is: holding that which is unenduring,  impure, full of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the  Soul.    This we have really considered already. The psychic man is  unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self. The  spiritual man is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real Self. The darkness  of unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical,  personal man, to the exclusion of the spiritual man. It is the belief,  carried into action, that the personal man is the real man, the man for  whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should  live. This is that psychical man of whom it is said: he that soweth to  the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.    6. Self-assertion comes from thinking of the Seer and the instrument  of vision as forming one self.    This is the fundamental idea of the Sankhya philosophy, of which the  Yoga is avowedly the practical side. To translate this into our terms,  we may say that the Seer is the spiritual man; the instrument of vision  is the psychical man, through which the spiritual man gains experience  of the outer world. But we turn the servant into the master. We  attribute to the psychical man, the personal self, a reality which really  belongs to the spiritual man alone; and so, thinking of the quality of  the spiritual man as belonging to the psychical, we merge the spiritual  man in the psychical; or, as the text says, we think of the two as  forming one self.    7. Lust is the resting in the sense of enjoyment.    This has been explained again and again. Sensation, as, for example,  the sense of taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case, the  choice of wholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and  hurtful things. But if we rest in the sense of taste, as a pleasure in  itself; rest, that is, in the psychical side of taste, we fall into  gluttony, and live to eat, instead of eating to live. So with the other  great organic power, the power of reproduction. This lust comes into  being, through resting in the sensation, and looking for pleasure from  that.    8. Hate is the resting in the sense of pain.    Pain comes, for the most part, from the strife of personalities, the  jarring discords between psychic selves, each of which deems itself  supreme. A dwelling on this pain breeds hate, which tears the warring  selves yet further asunder, and puts new enmity between them, thus  hindering the harmony of the Real, the reconciliation through the  Soul.    9. Attachment is the desire toward life, even in the wise, carried  forward by its own energy.    The life here desired is the psychic life, the intensely vibrating life of  the psychical self. This prevails even in those who have attained much  wisdom, so long as it falls short of the wisdom of complete  renunciation, complete obedience to each least behest of the spiritual  man, and of the Master who guards and aids the spiritual man.    The desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself,  carried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the  circle of death and rebirth, death and rebirth, instead of the liberation  of the spiritual man.    10. These hindrances, when they have become subtle, are to be  removed by a countercurrent.    The darkness of unwisdom is to be removed by the light of wisdom,  pursued through fervour, spiritual reading of holy teachings and of life  itself, and by obedience to the Master.    Lust is to be removed by pure aspiration of spiritual life, which,  bringing true strength and stability, takes away the void of weakness  which we try to fill by the stimulus of sensations.    Hate is to be overcome by love. The fear that arises through the sense  of separate, warring selves is to be stilled by the realization of the One  Self, the one soul in all. This realization is the perfect love that casts  out fear.    The hindrances are said to have become subtle when, by initial efforts,  they have been located and recognized in the psychic nature.    11. Their active turnings are to be removed by meditation.    Here is, in truth, the whole secret of Yoga, the science of the soul.  The active turnings, the strident vibrations, of selfishness, lust and hate  are to be stilled by meditation, by letting heart and mind dwell in  spiritual life, by lifting up the heart to the strong, silent life above,  which rests in the stillness of eternal love, and needs no harsh  vibration to convince it of true being.    12. The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in these hindrances.  It will be felt in this life, or in a life not yet manifested.    The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in the darkness of  unwisdom, in selfishness, in lust, in hate, in attachment to sensation.  All these are, in the last analysis, absorption in the psychical self; and  this means sorrow, because it means the sense of separateness, and  this means jarring discord and inevitable death. But the psychical self  will breed a new psychical self, in a new birth, and so new sorrows in  a life not yet manifest.    13. From this root there grow and ripen the fruits of birth, of the  life-span, of all that is tasted in life.    Fully to comment on this, would be to write a treatise on Karma and  its practical working in detail, whereby the place and time of the next  birth, its content and duration, are determined; and to do this the  present commentator is in no wise fitted. But this much is clearly  understood: that, through a kind of spiritual gravitation, the  incarnating self is drawn to a home and life-circle which will give it  scope and discipline; and its need of discipline is clearly conditioned  by its character, its standing, its accomplishment.    14. These bear fruits of rejoicing, or of affliction, as they are sprung  from holy or unholy works.    Since holiness is obedience to divine law, to the law of divine  harmony, and obedience to harmony strengthens that harmony in the  soul, which is the one true joy, therefore joy comes of holiness:  comes, indeed, in no other way. And as unholiness is disobedience,  and therefore discord, therefore unholiness makes for pain; and this  two-fold law is true, whether the cause take effect in this, or in a yet  unmanifested birth.    15. To him who possesses discernment, all personal life is misery,  because it ever waxes and wanes, is ever afflicted with restlessness,  makes ever new dynamic impresses in the mind; and because all its  activities war with each other.    The whole life of the psychic self is misery, because it ever waxes and  wanes; because birth brings inevitable death; because there is no  expectation without its shadow, fear. The life of the psychic self is  misery, because it is afflicted with restlessness; so that he who has  much, finds not satisfaction, but rather the whetted hunger for more.  The fire is not quenched by pouring oil on it; so desire is not quenched  by the satisfaction of desire. Again, the life of the psychic self is  misery, because it makes ever new dynamic impresses in the mind;  because a desire satisfied is but the seed from which springs the desire  to find like satisfaction again. The appetite comes in eating, as the  proverb says, and grows by what it feeds on. And the psychic self,  torn with conflicting desires, is ever the house divided against itself,  which must surely fall.    16. This pain is to be warded off, before it has come.    In other words, we cannot cure the pains of life by laying on them any  balm. We must cut the root, absorption in the psychical self. So it is  said, there is no cure for the misery of longing, but to fix the heart  upon the eternal.    17. The cause of what is to be warded off, is the absorption of the  Seer in things seen.    Here again we have the fundamental idea of the Sankhya, which is the  intellectual counterpart of the Yoga system. The cause of what is to  be warded off, the root of misery, is the absorption of consciousness  in the psychical man and the things which beguile the psychical man.  The cure is liberation.    18. Things seen have as their property manifestation, action, inertia.  They form the basis of the elements and the sense-powers. They make  for experience and for liberation.    Here is a whole philosophy of life. Things seen, the total of the  phenomena, possess as their property, manifestation, action, inertia:  the qualities of force and matter in combination. These, in their  grosser form, make the material world; in their finer, more subjective  form, they make the psychical world, the world of sense-impressions  and mind-images. And through this totality of the"]]]
