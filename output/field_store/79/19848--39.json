The sand was hauled by wagon  and shoveled into the upper end of the flume; the current carried it  down into one of the tanks washing the dirt loose and carrying it off  with the overflow over the end of the tank while the sand settled in the  tank. When one tank was full the flow was diverted into the other tank  and the sand in the first tank was shoveled out, loaded into wagons, and  hauled to the stock pile. As built this washer handled about 30 cu. yds.  of sand per 10-hour day, but the tanks were built too small for the  flume, which could readily handle 75 cu. yds. per day with no larger  working force. This force consisted of three men at $1.50 per day,  making the cost, for a 30 cu. yd. output, 15 cts. per cu. yd. for  washing.    None of the figures given above includes the cost of handling the sand  to and from the washer. When this involves much extra loading and  hauling, it amounts to a considerable expense, and in any plan for  washing sand the contractor should figure, with exceeding care, the  extra handling due to the necessity of washing.      AGGREGATES.    The aggregates commonly used in making concrete are broken or crushed  stone, gravel, slag and cinders. Slag and cinders make a concrete that  weighs considerably less than stone or gravel mixtures, and being the  products of combustion are commonly supposed to make a specially fire  resisting concrete; their use is, therefore, confined very closely to  fireproof building work and, in fact, to floor construction for such  buildings. Slag and cinder concretes are for this reason given minor  consideration in this volume.    ~BROKEN STONE.~--Stone produced by crushing any of the harder and tougher  varieties of rock is suitable for concrete. Perhaps the best stone is  produced by crushing trap rock. Crushed trap besides being hard and  tough is angular and has an excellent fracture surface for holding  cement; it also withstands heat better than most stone. Next to trap  the hard, tough, crystalline limestones make perhaps the best all around  concrete material; cement adheres to limestone better than to any other  rock. Limestone, however, calcines when subjected to fire and is,  therefore, objected to by many engineers for building construction. The  harder and denser sandstones, mica-schists, granites and syanites make  good stone for concrete and occasionally shale and slate may be used.    ~GRAVEL.~--Gravel makes one of the best possible aggregates for concrete.  The conditions under which gravel is produced by nature make it  reasonably certain that only the tougher and harder rocks enter into its  composition; the rounded shapes of the component particles permit gravel  to be more closely tamped than broken stone and give less danger of  voids from bridging; the mixture is also generally a fairly well  balanced composition of fine and coarse particles. The surfaces of the  particles being generally smooth give perhaps a poorer bond with the  cement than most broken stone. In the matter of strength the most recent  tests show that there is very little choice between gravel and broken  stone concrete.    ~SLAG AND CINDERS.~--The slag used for concrete aggregate is iron blast  furnace slag crushed to proper size. Cinders for aggregate are steam  boiler cinders; they are best with the fine ashes screened out and  should not contain more than 15 per cent. of unburned coal.    ~BALANCED AGGREGATE.~--With the aggregate, as with the sand for concrete,  the best results, other things being equal, will be secured by using a  well-balanced mixture of coarse and fine particles. Usually the product  of a rock crusher is fairly well balanced except for the very fine  material. There is nearly always a deficiency of this, which, as  explained in a succeeding section, has to be supplied by adding sand.  Usually, also, the engineer accepts the crusher product coarser than  screenings as being well enough balanced for concrete work, but this is  not always the case. Engineers occasionally demand an artificial mixture  of varying proportions of different size stones and may even go so far  as to require gravel to be screened and reproportioned. This artificial  grading of the aggregate adds to the cost of the concrete in some  proportion which must be determined for each individual case.    ~SIZE OF AGGREGATE.~--The size of aggregate to be used depends upon the  massiveness of the structure, its purpose, and whether or not it is  reinforced. It is seldom that aggregate larger than will pass a 3-in.  ring is used and this only in very massive work. The more usual size is  2½ ins. For reinforced concrete 1¼ ins. is about the maximum size  allowed and in building work 1-in. aggregate is most commonly used. Same  constructors use no aggregate larger than ¾ in. in reinforced building  work, and others require that for that portion of the concrete coming  directly in contact with the reinforcement the aggregate shall not  exceed ¼ to ½ in. The great bulk of concrete work is done with aggregate  smaller than 2 ins., and as a general thing where the massiveness of the  structure will allow of much larger sizes it will be more economic to  use rubble concrete. (See Chapter VI.)    ~COST OF AGGREGATE.~--The locality in which the work is done determines  the cost of the aggregate. Concerns producing broken stone or screened  and washed gravel for concrete are to be found within shipping distance  in most sections of the country so that these materials may be purchased  in any amount desired. The cost will then be the market price of the  material f. o. b. cars at plant plus the freight rates and the cost of  unloading and haulage to the stock piles. If the contractor uses a local  stone or gravel the aggregate cost will be, for stone the costs of  quarrying and crushing and transportation, and, for gravel, the cost of  excavation, screening, washing and transportation.    ~SCREENED OR CRUSHER-RUN STONE FOR CONCRETE.~--Formerly engineers almost  universally demanded that broken stone for concrete should have all the  finer particles screened out. This practice has been modified to some  considerable extent in recent years by using all the crusher product  both coarse and fine, or, as it is commonly expressed, by using  run-of-crusher stone. The comparative merits of screened and crusher-run  stone for concrete work are questions of comparative economy and  convenience. The fine stone dust and chips produced in crushing stone  are not, as was once thought, deleterious; they simply take the place of  so much of the sand which would, were the stone screened, be required to  balance the sand and stone mixture. It is seldom that the proportion of  chips and dust produced in crushing stone is large enough to replace the  sand constituent entirely; some sand has nearly always to be added to  run-of-crusher stone and it is in determining the amount of this  addition that uncertainty lies. The proportions of dust and chips in  crushed stone vary with the kind of stone and with the kind of crusher  used. Furthermore, when run-of-crusher stone is chuted from the crusher  into a bin or pile the screenings and the coarse stones segregate.  Examination of a crusher-run stone pile will show a cone-shaped heart of  fine material enclosed by a shell of coarser stone, consequently when  this pile of stone is taken from to make concrete a uniform mixture of  fine and coarse particles is not secured, the material taken from the  outside of the pile will be mostly coarse and that from the inside  mostly fine. This segregation combined with the natural variation in the  crusher product makes the task of adding sand and producing a balanced  sand and stone mixture one of extreme uncertainty and some difficulty  unless considerable expenditure is made in testing and reproportioning.  When the product of the crusher is screened the task of proportioning  the sand to the stone is a straightforward operation, and the screened  out chips and dust can be used as a portion of the sand if desired. The  only saving, then, in using crusher-run stone direct is the very small  one of not having to screen out the fine material. The conclusion must  be that the economy of unscreened stone for concrete is a very doubtful  quantity, and that the risk of irregularity in unscreened stone mixtures  is a serious one. The engineer's specifications will generally determine  for the contractor whether he is to use screened or crusher-run stone,  but these same specifications will not guarantee the regularity of the  resulting concrete mixture; this will be the contractor's burden and if  the engineer's inspection is rigid and the crusher-run product runs  uneven for the reasons given above it will be a burden of considerable  expense. The contractor will do well to know his product or to know his  man before bidding less or even as little on crusher-run as on screened  stone concrete.    ~COST OF QUARRYING AND CRUSHING STONE.~--The following examples of the  cost of quarrying and crushing stone are fairly representative of the  conditions which would prevail on ordinary contract work. In quarrying  and crushing New Jersey trap rock with gyratory crushers the following  was the cost of producing 200 cu. yds. per day:                                            Per day.

But you're leaving out the shepherd's best helper.\"    Sandy's face suddenly softened into tenderness.    \"His best helper?\" repeated Donald.    \"Aye, laddie! His dogs!\"    Bending down the Scotchman thrust his hand into the ruff of shaggy hair  about the neck of one of the collies beside him. There was a low growl  from the other dog, who rose and rested his pointed nose on Sandy's  knee.    The man laughed.    \"Robin,\" he said, addressing the collie before him, \"must you always  take it amiss if I have a word for Prince Charlie? You're no gentleman!  Down, both of you!\"    The collies crouched at his feet.    \"I never can speak to one without speaking to the other,\" he went on.  \"They are jealous as magpies.\"    \"They are the finest dogs I ever saw, Sandy.\"    \"I pride myself there are not many like them,\" agreed the herder. \"I  raised them from puppies and trained them myself. Now Colin, who also  goes with me when I go to the hills, is a good dog, but he is not my  own. He belongs to the ranch. So do Victor and Hector. You never feel  the same toward them as you do with those you have brought up yourself.  Robin and Prince Charlie are not to be matched in the county. But to see  them at their best you must see 'em on the range.\"    \"I wish I could!\"    \"So it's to the range you'd be going, is it? Well, well--belike when the  herds are made up and we set out your father will let you go up into the  hills a piece with me.\"    \"Oh, Sandy,\" cried the boy, \"would you take me? Do you suppose father  would let me go?\"    \"'Twill do no harm to ask him. I must wait, though, until I see the  other herders off, and until Thornton is back from Glen City. The  flocks must have a few days' rest after the dipping. Poor things! It is  a sorry time they have being dipped in that hot bath just after they  have lost their thick, warm coats; it makes them more chilly than ever.  Then, too, they sometimes get small cuts while they are being sheared  and the lime and sulphur makes the bruises smart. I am always sorry for  the beasties. Yet after all I comfort myself with thinking that it is  better they should be wretched for a little while than to be sick for a  long while. It is like sitting in a dark room when you have the  measles--you do not like it but you know you will be worse off if you  don't do it.\"    Sandy laughed and so did Donald.    \"Then it will be several days before you start for the range, Sandy.\"    \"Yes. I must wait for Thornton. I can't leave your father here alone. He  might want me.\"    \"You have been a great help to my father, Sandy.\"    \"It's little enough I've done. I would do a good sight more if the need  came. A McCulloch would do anything in his power for Crescent Ranch or  its owners.\"    \"I believe you, Sandy.\"    \"You do well to believe me, lad, for I speak the living truth!\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IV    SANDY GIVES DONALD A LESSON      During the next few days preparations for the range went steadily  forward.    Most of the herders had been so long at Crescent Ranch that they knew  exactly what to do. It was an ancient story to men who had worked under  Old Angus and Johnson.    To Donald, however, everything was new. From morning to night he trotted  after Sandy until one day the young Scotchman remarked with a  mischievous smile:    \"You put me verra much in mind of one of my collies--I declare if you  don't!\"    The boy chuckled.    \"It is all so different from anything I ever saw before, Sandy. I am  finding out so many things! Why, until yesterday I thought sheep were  just sheep--all of them the same kind. Father mentioned Merinos, and I  supposed they were all Merinos.\"    \"Well! Well! And so you have found out that they are not all the same  kind? How many kinds have you learned about, pray?\"    Donald took Sandy's banter in good part.    \"You needn't laugh, Sandy,\" he said. \"Lots and lots of our sheep are  Merinos, aren't they?\"    \"Aye, laddie. Merinos are a good sheep for wool-growing. They are no so  bonny--having a wrinkled skin and wool on their faces; they are small,  too. But their coat is fine and long, and they are kindly. The American  Merinos are the best range sheep we have, because they are so hardy and  stay together so well. Some sheep scatter. It seems to be in their blood  to wander about. Of course you can't take sheep like that on the range.  They would be all over the state.\"    \"I should think it would be a great bother to cut the wool from a Merino  when he is so wrinkly,\" suggested Donald thoughtfully.    \"You show your wit--it is a bother. It takes much longer to clip them  than it does a smooth-skinned sheep. Besides, their fleece is heavy, for  it contains a great deal of oil--or as we call it, yolk. But have done  with Merinos. What others did you learn about?\"    \"One of the herders told me about the Delaine Merinos and showed me the  long parallel fibers in their wool; he also pointed out a French Merino,  or--or--a----\"    \"Rambouillet!\" laughed Sandy. \"I was waiting to hear you twist your  tongue around that word. It took me full a week to learn to say it, and  even now I never say it in a hurry. We have many a French Merino here;  they belong, though, to quite a different family from the other Merinos.  You will find them a much larger sheep, and their wool coarse fibered.  They are great eaters, these French Merinos.\"    \"Like me!\" cried Donald.    \"Verra like you!\" agreed Sandy. \"But it is no so easy filling them up.  Why, they will eat a whole hillside in no time. They can beat you, too,  on staying out in all sorts of weather. Here in Idaho we generally have  fairly mild winters, so our sheep can be out all the year round. We have  a few shacks down in the valley where we can shelter them if we have  cold rains during the season. They feed down there along the river,  eating sage-brush and dried hay from fall until spring. It is often  scant picking, but if it is too scant we give them grain, alfalfa hay,  or sometimes pumpkins.\"    \"Why, I never dreamed they stayed out all winter!\" ejaculated Donald,  opening his eyes.    \"In a state where it is as mild as this one they can. Then in the spring  when the shearing, dipping, and all is done, we start for the range. We  never go, though, until the sun has baked the grass a while, for if the  herd crops too early the sheep pull at the new shoots that are just  taking hold in the soil and up they come--roots and all. Then in future  you will have no grass--just bare ground. Very early grass is bad for  sheep, too.\"    \"What do people do where there are no ranges, Sandy?\"    \"Their sheep are kept in great fenced-in pastures and fed from troughs  or feeding racks. They have alfalfa hay, turnips, rape, kale, corn,  pumpkins and grain. The range sheep are the hardiest, though. Sheep were  made to climb and scramble over rocky places, and they are stronger and  healthier for doing it.\"    \"I'd rather be a range sheep!\" declared Donald.    \"And I!\" agreed Sandy promptly. \"But you're no through telling me about  the sorts of sheep you learned about. Didn't anybody tell you about the  Cotswolds?\"    Donald shook his head.    \"Oh, that's a sad pity. They are such big, grand fellows with their  white faces and white legs. And dinna forget the Lincolns. You will have  no trouble in knowing a Lincoln. They are the heaviest sheep we have,  and their wool is long. A Lincoln is handsome as a painting; in fact I'd  far rather have one than some of the paintings I've seen. You want to  get sight of one when its fleece is full! We have a scattering, too, of  Leicesters and Dorset Horns, but the Dorsets are such fighters that I  dinna care much for them. They will even attack the dogs.\"    \"I never heard of sheep doing that!\"    \"Now and again they will, but not often.\"    Sandy paused and began to whistle softly to himself.    \"Are--are those all the kinds of sheep, Sandy?\" ventured Donald at last,  after he had waited for some time and there seemed to be no prospect of  Sandy coming to the end of his tune.    \"All! Hear the lad! All! Indeed and that's not all! There are Cheviots  from the English and Scotch hill country. You've had a cheviot suit,  mayhap. Yes? Well, that's where you got it. Then there is the Tunis and  the Persian. California, Nevada, and Texas raise Persians. They are a  fat-tailed sheep. We never went in for them here. In England you will  find a host of other sorts of sheep that are raised on the English  Downs; most of them are short-haired and are raised not so much for  their wool as for their mutton. There are Southdowns, Hampshire Downs,  Sussex, Oxfords, Shropshire Downs, and the Dorset Horns. We always like  some Shropshires in our herd.\"    \"Oh, Sandy,\" groaned Donald with a wry smile, \"I never, never can  remember all these kinds.\"    \"Dinna shed tears about it, laddie. The wool will keep growing on their  backs just the same. But it's likely that you'll never again be thinking  that a sheep is just a sheep!\"    \"Indeed I shan't!\"    \"As for myself,\" went on Sandy, \"I like all kinds; I like the smell of  them, and being with them on the range. You'll like the range, too, if  your father lets you go. You'll like the big sky, the crisp air, and the  peace of it.\"    \"I hope he will let me go.\"    \"Dinna fear! We will ask him to-night or to-morrow. Thornton will be  back to-morrow. Then we'll be getting ready the wagons and our own kit.\"    \"What wagons?\"    \"Did you no see the canvas-topped wagons in the barn? Verra like gipsy  wagons they are. We call them prairie schooners because they are the  sort of wagon the first settlers crossed the country in. Ships of the  Desert they were indeed! In the West we use them even now. When we go to  the range three of these wagons go along part way and carry the food,  establishing what we call central camps. From these camps provisions are  brought to us.\"    \"Don't you come down for your food!\" exclaimed Donald,"]]]
