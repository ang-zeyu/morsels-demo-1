Those wicked tribes in the land of Canaan, and upon its borders, were in  the way of the establishment of any civil institution. It is to be  remembered, also, that the children of Israel did not forfeit their rights  in the land by going down into Egypt in the time of a famine.    The land was theirs by right of preoccupancy and by gift. Upon their  return from Egypt they found no civil institutions in the land, but, on  the contrary, the people were burning their own children in the fire. They  were also guilty of every abominable thing that was hateful in the sight  of God. They were utterly unqualified for citizenship in any civil state,  so they were cut off as cankers upon the body.    To the same end, the greatest good to the greatest number, our government  has cut off thousands of better men. When the children of Israel went into  the idolatrous worship of those wicked heathen and burned their sons and  daughters in the fire to Molech, the Lord gave them statutes and laws  which were not good, and whereby they might not live. He served them  right. How can civil government be perpetuated, or even exist, in the  midst of such heathenish idolatry? If infidel objections, based upon the  destruction of such wicked hordes as were put to death in Canaan, are  worth anything they are worth enough to sanction, by the protection of  civil government, all manner of abominations that are known among  barbarous heathen.    These enemies of God and the Bible talk as though such an outrage as  burning sons and daughters in the fire to idol gods should not be visited  with such punishment. Would they do any better? Could they manage such  barbarous murderers better for the general good? If it was possible for a  civil government to allow such characters the rights of citizenship it  would be at the expense of giving license to all other crimes, for there  are no crimes greater in their heinousness than _murderous idolatry_. If  infidels ever get the power in this or any other civil government, and  carry out the spirit of their lectures against the God of the Bible, the  government will soon come to an end, and crime of every grade and  character will prevail. American citizens have seen many better men than  old Amalek die. It is possible that a few unbelievers who were out in the  late civil war have seen better men die. It is possible that a few  unbelieving colonels have killed better men upon Southern battle-fields,  and it is possible that a few of them are traveling over the country  abusing Moses and the God of the Bible for putting worse men to death.    Let us ever remember that the eternal laws of right, sometimes,  necessitate the destruction of human life. The greatest good of the  greatest number is an object that should always govern the action of a  nation. This law should never be disregarded. Murder, having no connection  with the general good, is a very different thing. When an individual is  put to death by an individual to gratify malice its relations are not with  the general good.    All sensible men, who are acquainted with the Bible, know that the facts  of the Bible, known in the ancient wars of the nation of Israel, like the  facts known in the wars of our own nation, would look terrible in the  relations of murder. Things out of their relations are always ugly. A man  and a woman living together as husband and wife outside of the marriage  relation, would be in adultery, while others living in the same manner,  but inside of the matrimonial relation, would be in a grand and  praiseworthy union. Why is it that sensible men will wrest the Scriptures,  taking things out of their proper relations, and do it to their own  condemnation? \"Happy is the man who condemneth not himself in that thing  which he alloweth.\"            IT ONLY NEEDS TO BE SEEN, AND ITS UGLINESS AT ONCE APPEARS.      \"Are such shams of rights, as caucus-and-ballot-boxism can give us, worth  spending any more time and money and agitation upon? I ask, and I appeal  to what has been most lyingly named free government in Greece, Rome,  England, Venice, France, the United States, and wherever else it has been  attempted to _make permanent the crisis stage_ of progress which marks the  departure from monarchy. No, my friends, art-liberty _alone_ can be of any  avail.... By art-liberty, my friends, I mean the _practical application_  of _all_ science and art _systemized_ as fast as unfolded. The only law  which can govern a free state must be _discovered_; it must be drawn from  the _whole of science and art_--not 'enacted.' Human law can no more be  'enacted' than can physical law.\" ... \"Man's leaders must find out how to  satisfy man's highest aspirations, instead of catering for his prejudices;  instead of confirming him, by flattery and cajolery, in his false,  supernaturalistic notions; instead of studying the trickery of  representing and plundering him. And they will rapidly find this out, as  soon as a knowledge (already attained) of the _unity of science_ spreads  among them, and along with it its correllate, that all mankind are one  organism, no individual of which can be indifferent to _each_ and _all_ of  the others. Enlightened, far-seeing, _all-benefiting selfishness_ will  then take the place of short-sighted, suicidal, penny-wise pound-foolish  cunning; and that barricade of hypocrisy, duty, that most fallible of all  guides, conscience, and 'virtue' and 'vice,' those most unscientific and  mischievous expressions that have ever crept into the vocabulary of human  folly, will be obsolete.\"    Here is the outcome of the liberty that infidels talk so much about.  \"Art-liberty\" is to ANNIHILATE CONSCIENCE and the distinction between  virtue and vice so completely that there will be no more use for the  words, \"they will be obsolete.\" \"All benefiting selfishness will then  govern humanity.\" Reader, are you prepared for such a state of society?  \"If all _contracts_ in accordance with present 'law' were fulfilled to the  letter, and if all the '_duties_' enjoined by present moralism were  unflinchingly performed, and if all which 'virtue' styles 'vice' was  entirely abstained from, and if what is now 'free trade' according to  'law,' had a 'fair field,' how long would it take a millionth of the  earth's inhabitants to accumulate _all_ its wealth? In my opinion, it  would not take ten generations to produce that reign of 'law,'  'principle,' 'morality,' 'virtue' and 'free trade,' or  mind-your-own-business, and every-one-for-himself-ism, on the earth.\" Are  infidels down on law, down on virtue, down on principle, down on morality,  etc.? _It seems so._ \"But there must be no stealing, swindling or robbery,  as _legally defined, on any_ account; and there must be no sexual  intercourse out of the bonds of monogamy, _even for bread_, and, above  all, there must be no acts, or even words of _treason_. The laboring man  and the laboring woman must patiently and slowly (nay, not very slowly,  I'm thinking,) die on such wages as they who, _in perfect security_, hold  all the wealth, choose to give; and those out of work must brave martyrdom  to 'principle,' by starving straightway, unless they can obtain a 'permit'  to drag out a few months, possibly years, in sack-cloth and on water-gruel  in an almshouse.... Was Thomas Paine here to-day his old remedies,  religious and political _popular_ free discussion and reasoning, would be  thrown aside or only used to assist science and art to displace them in  religious and state affairs.\" Truth will come to the surface! Here it is  speaking for itself. The office of \"art-liberty,\" the liberty for which  infidels plead, is to destroy _popular free discussion_ and _reasoning_,  allowing them _only_ in order to destroy themselves, that is, allowing the  infidels to use them to displace them in RELIGIOUS and STATE _affairs_.  This is called \"art-liberty;\" liberty in art and science, and despotism in  religion and politics OR STATE. Such a society, plus the absence of  conscience, virtue and vice, is the infidel's ideal of free government.  All this means is simply \"intolerance\" by law; intolerance in \"religious  and state affairs.\"    When such a state of society is brought about in this country the infidels  will have more _hell_ than they will relish. Listen once more, \"Man's  right to be self-governed is, equally with his desire to be so,  _self-evident_.\" How are these infidels going to have self-government and  intolerance by law in matters of religion and state? This Godless infidel  says, \"But what is most insultingly _termed_ 'elective franchise' is the  farthest thing possible from self-government.... The _popular_ free  discussion of affairs of the last degree of complication, religious and  state affairs, except during the _crisis_ period of revolution, only  renders that worst of despotisms, anarchy, chronic; it seats in the social  organism that political gangrene, demagogism, which has always hitherto  sooner or later required the cauterization of military despotism in order  to save even civilization. Despotism is the most inveterate of all the  diseases of the social organism which ignorance has inflicted; nay, it is  a complication of all its diseases. What, my fellow-man, would any of you  think of the physician who should consult with an individual organism with  a view to taking that organism's opinion as to what course he (the  physician) had best pursue in order to cure him (the organism) of  scrofula, complicated with every other bodily disease to which flesh is  heir?... Evidently, church and state management require art and skill  infinitely superior to what 'supernaturalism' and its legitimate child  monarchism, or its bastard issue, caucus-and-ballot-boxism, are capable  of. From the dissecting-room, the chemical laboratory, the astronomical  observatory, the physician's and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2808"],[0,"Treatises on Friendship and Old Age (#5)"],[1,"as to what they will do for  their friends; and it is the recriminations of such people which  commonly not only quench friendships, but give rise to lasting enmities.  \"In fact,\" he used to say, \"these fatalities overhang friendship in such  numbers that it requires not only wisdom but good luck also to escape  them all.\"    11. With these premises, then, let us first, if you please, examine  the question--how far ought personal feeling to go in friendship? For  instance: suppose Coriolanus to have had friends, ought they to have  joined him in invading his country? Again, in the case of Vecellinus  or Spurius Maelius, ought their friends to have assisted them in their  attempt to establish a tyranny? Take two instances of either line of  conduct. When Tiberius Gracchus attempted his revolutionary measures he  was deserted, as we saw, by Quintus Tubero and the friends of his own  standing. On the other hand, a friend of your own family, Scaevola,  Gaius Blossius of Cumae, took a different course. I was acting as  assessor to the consuls Laenas and Rupilius to try the conspirators,  and Blossius pleaded for my pardon on the ground that his regard for  Tiberius Gracchus had been so high that he looked upon his wishes as  law. \"Even if he had wished you to set fire to the Capitol?\" said I.  \"That is a thing,\" he replied, \"that he never would have wished.\" \"Ah,  but if he had wished it?\" said I. \"I would have obeyed.\" The wickedness  of such a speech needs no comment. And in point of fact he was as good  and better than his word for he did not wait for orders in the audacious  proceedings of Tiberius Gracchus, but was the head and front of them,  and was a leader rather than an abettor of his madness. The result  of his infatuation was that he fled to Asia, terrified by the special  commission appointed to try him, joined the enemies of his country, and  paid a penalty to the republic as heavy as it was deserved. I conclude,  then, that the plea of having acted in the interests of a friend is not  a valid excuse for a wrong action. For, seeing that a belief in a man's  virtue is the original cause of friendship, friendship can hardly remain  if virtue he abandoned. But if we decide it to be right to grant our  friends whatever they wish, and to ask them for whatever we wish,  perfect wisdom must be assumed on both sides if no mischief is to  happen. But we cannot assume this perfect wisdom; for we are speaking  only of such friends as are ordinarily to be met with, whether we have  actually seen them or have been told about them--men, that is to say, of  everyday life. I must quote some examples of such persons, taking care  to select such as approach nearest to our standard of wisdom. We read,  for instance, that Papus Aemilius was a close friend of Gaius Luscinus.  History tells us that they were twice consuls together, and colleagues  in the censorship. Again, it is on record that Manius Curius and  Tiberius Coruncanius were on the most intimate terms with them and with  each other. Now, we cannot even suspect that any one of these men ever  asked of his friend anything that militated against his honour or his  oath or the interests of the republic. In the case of such men as these  there is no point in saying that one of them would not have obtained  such a request if he had made it; for they were men of the most  scrupulous piety, and the making of such a request would involve a  breach of religious obligation no less than the granting it. However,  it is quite true that Gaius Carbo and Gaius Cato did follow Tiberius  Gracchus; and though his brother Caius Gracchus did not do so at the  time, he is now the most eager of them all.    12. We may then lay down this rule of friendship--neither ask nor  consent to do what is wrong. For the plea \"for friendship's sake\" is a  discreditable one, and not to be admitted for a moment. This rule  holds good for all wrong-doing, but more especially in such as involves  disloyalty to the republic. For things have come to such a point with  us, my dear Fannius and Scaevola, that we are bound to look somewhat far  ahead to what is likely to happen to the republic. The constitution, as  known to our ancestors, has already swerved somewhat from the regular  course and the lines marked out for it. Tiberius Gracchus made an  attempt to obtain the power of a king, or, I might rather say, enjoyed  that power for a few months. Had the Roman people ever heard or seen  the like before? What the friends and connexions that followed him, even  after his death, have succeeded in doing in the case of Publius Scipio  I cannot describe without tears. As for Carbo, thanks to the punishment  recently inflicted on Tiberius Gracchus, we have by hook or by crook  managed to hold out against his attacks. But what to expect of the  tribuneship of Caius Gracchus I do not like to forecast. One thing  leads to another; and once set going, the downward course proceeds with  ever-increasing velocity. There is the case of the ballot: what a blow  was inflicted first by the lex Gabinia, and two years afterwards by the  lex Cassia! I seem already to see the people estranged from the Senate,  and the most important affairs at the mercy of the multitude. For you  may be sure that more people will learn how to set such things in motion  than how to stop them. What is the point of these remarks? This: no one  ever makes any attempt of this sort without friends to help him. We  must therefore impress upon good men that, should they become inevitably  involved in friendships with men of this kind, they ought not to  consider themselves under any obligation to stand by friends who are  disloyal to the republic. Bad men must have the fear of punishment  before their eyes: a punishment not less severe for those who follow  than for those who lead others to crime. Who was more famous and  powerful in Greece than Themistocles? At the head of the army in the  Persian war he had freed Greece; he owed his exile to personal envy: but  he did not submit to the wrong done him by his ungrateful country as  he ought to have done. He acted as Coriolanus had acted among us twenty  years before. But no one was found to help them in their attacks upon  their fatherland. Both of them accordingly committed suicide.    We conclude, then, not only that no such confederation of evilly  disposed men must be allowed to shelter itself under the plea of  friendship, but that, on the contrary, it must be visited with the  severest punishment, lest the idea should prevail that fidelity to a  friend justifies even making war upon one's country. And this is a case  which I am inclined to think, considering how things are beginning to  go, will sooner or later arise. And I care quite as much what the state  of the constitution will be after my death as what it is now.    13. Let this, then, be laid down as the first law of friendship, that  _we should ask from friends, and do for friends', only what is good_.  But do not let us wait to be asked either: let there be ever an eager  readiness, and an absence of hesitation. Let us have the courage to give  advice with candour. In friendship, let the influence of friends who  give good advice be paramount; and let this influence be used to enforce  advice not only in plain-spoken terms, but sometimes, if the case  demands it, with sharpness; and when so used, let it be obeyed.    I give you these rules because I believe that some wonderful opinions  are entertained by certain persons who have, I am told, a reputation for  wisdom in Greece. There is nothing in the world, by the way, beyond the  reach of their sophistry. Well, some of them teach that we should avoid  very close friendships, for fear that one man should have to endure the  anxieties of several. Each man, say they, has enough and to spare on his  own hands; it is too bad to be involved in the cares of other people.  The wisest course is to hold the reins of friendship as loose as  possible; you can then tighten or slacken them at your will. For the  first condition of a happy life is freedom from care, which no one's  mind can enjoy if it has to travail, so to speak, for others besides  itself. Another sect, I am told, gives vent to opinions still less  generous. I briefly touched on this subject just now. They affirm that  friendships should be sought solely for the sake of the assistance they  give, and not at all from motives of feeling and affection; and that  therefore just in proportion as a man's power and means of support are  lowest, he is most eager to gain friendships: thence it comes that weak  women seek the support of friendship more than men, the poor more than  the rich, the unfortunate rather than those esteemed prosperous. What  noble philosophy! You might just as well take the sun out of the sky as  friendship from life; for the immortal gods have given us nothing better  or more delightful.    But let us examine the two doctrines. What is the value of this  \"freedom from care\"? It is very tempting at first sight, but in practice  it has in many cases to be put on one side. For there is no business  and no course of action demanded from us by our honour which you can  consistently decline, or lay aside when begun, from a mere wish to  escape from anxiety. Nay, if we wish to avoid anxiety we must avoid  virtue itself, which necessarily involves some anxious thoughts in  showing its loathing and abhorrence for the qualities which are opposite  to itself--as kindness for ill-nature, self-control for licentiousness,  courage for cowardice. Thus you may notice that it is the just who are  most pained at injustice, the brave at cowardly actions, the temperate  at depravity. It is then characteristic of a rightly ordered mind to be  pleased at what is good and grieved at the reverse. Seeing then that the  wise are not exempt from the heart-ache (which must be the case unless  we suppose all human nature rooted"]]]
