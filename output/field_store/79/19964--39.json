Soon the Count heard a noise near his apartment, and the  captain of the guard burst in to tell him a robbery had been committed  in the square. No sooner had Arnheim seated himself in his official  place than the people hustled in Arline. Florestein was in the midst  of the mob; going at once to his uncle he cried:    \"Your lordship, it is I who have been robbed!\"    \"Ah! some more of your trouble-making. Why are you forever bringing  the family name into some ill-sounding affair?\"    \"But, uncle, it is true that I am a victim. There is the very girl who  robbed me!\" he cried, pointing to Arline. The Count looked pityingly  at her.    \"What--the pretty girl I saw in the square? So young and innocent a  face!\"    \"However that may be, she has stolen my medallion: we found it upon  her!\"    \"Can this be true, my child?\" the Count asked gently.    \"No, your lordship. I have done nothing wrong; but alas! there is no  one to help me.\"    At that the Count became more distressed. The thought of his own child  returned to him. She might be somewhere as hardly pressed and as  helpless as this young gipsy girl.    \"We can prove her guilty,\" Florestein persisted.    \"Tell me your story, my child. I shall try to do you justice,\" the  Count urged, looking kindly at Arline.    \"The Queen of our tribe gave me that medallion. I do not know how she  possessed herself of it, unless----\" Arline suddenly remembered the  scene at her wedding, and half guessed the truth. \"Your lordship, I  cannot prove it, but I believe she gave me a medallion which she knew  to be stolen, in order to revenge herself upon me for giving her  displeasure last night!\" The old Count gazed thoughtfully at her. He  believed her story: she looked truthful, and her tone was honest.    \"I believe you,\" he answered, at last, \"yet since you cannot prove  this, I have no alternative but to hand you over to justice.\"    \"Then, sir, I can deliver myself!\" she cried, drawing a dagger, and  was about to plunge it into her heart when the horrified Count sprung  forward and stopped her. As he seized her arm, he glanced at the scar  upon it: then started and looked closely at her face. Again the face  of his lost daughter was before him. He looked at the painting of the  little girl upon the wall, and again at Arline. They were so like that  he could doubt no longer.    \"Tell me--how did you come by that scar upon your arm--speak the  truth, because my very life hangs upon it, my child.\" By this time the  whole mob had gathered excitedly about the girl and the old judge.    \"When I was six years old a wild deer wounded me--\" the Count nearly  fainted with hope--\"I was saved and--\" at this moment, Thaddeus,  having shaken off his guard, rushed in to help Arline. She cried out  happily and pointed to him. \"It was he who saved my life,\" she said.  \"It was Thaddeus!\" The Count recognized the man who had refused to  drink the health of the Emperor at the banquet years before! Clearly  it was his own child who had been brought before him!    With a joyous cry he clasped her in his arms, but she did not know the  meaning of his joy or of the excitement, and, frightened and  bewildered, she ran to Thaddeus. Thaddeus pointed sadly to the Count:    \"It _is_ thy father, Arline. It is true,\" and he buried his face in  his hands. He must now give her up. Since she had found a noble father  he could not hope to be near her again, and while he stood with his  face in his hands, and Arline was again in the arms of the Count,  Devilshoof made his way in through the crowd, and tried to drag  Thaddeus away. He loved his comrade of twelve years, and he saw that  harm might come to him in the new situation.      ACT III    After leaving the Hall of Justice, Arline returned with her father to  the home of her childhood, for her dream had come true: she \"dwelt in  marble halls, with vassals and serfs at her side.\" Yet she was far  from happy: Thaddeus had left the hall with Devilshoof on the day of  Arline's arrest, and she had not seen him since. Gorgeously dressed in  a ball gown, she was in a beautiful room in her father's house. Her  father entered with Florestein and begged her to think kindly of her  silly foppish cousin.    \"You have every reason to be resentful toward Florestein,\" he said,  \"but if you can think kindly of him for my sake it would make me very  happy. I have always intended you to marry each other.\"    At that Arline was very wretched; and after a moment she said:  \"Father, I should like to please you, but I cannot think  affectionately of my cousin,\" and before the argument could be carried  further, a servant entered to tell them that the palace was filling  with guests, and that the Count was needed. Florestein and the Count  then went to meet the company, leaving Arline alone to recover her  self-possession. She became very sad for she was thinking of Thaddeus  and of the days she had spent wandering over the world with him and  the gipsies. Suddenly she went to a cabinet, took her gipsy dress from  it, and looked at it, the tears streaming from her eyes. While she was  lost in the memories of other days, Devilshoof jumped in at the window  and Arline nearly screamed upon seeing him so suddenly.    \"Don't scream! Don't be frightened,\" he said quickly. \"I have come to  say how we all miss you, and to beg you to come back to the tribe. I  have brought with me one whose powers of persuasion are greater than  mine,\" he added, and instantly Thaddeus appeared at the window, while  Arline, unable to restrain herself, rushed into his arms.    \"Ah, I feared you would forget me in the midst of so much luxury and  wealth,\" he said happily.    \"Oh, Thaddeus, did I not also dream--which pleased me most--that you  loved me still the same?\" she reminded him.    \"I came only to entreat you sometimes to think of me,\" he now said  with a lighter heart, \"and also I came to tell you--\" he paused,  kissed her, and then sang:    [Music:         When other lips and other hearts         Their tales of love shall tell,       In language whose excess imparts         The pow'r they feel so well:       There may, perhaps, in such a scene,         Some recollection be       Of days that have as happy been,         And you'll remember me, and you'll remember,         You'll remember me.]         When coldness or deceit shall slight         The beauty now they prize,       And deem it but a faded light         Which beams within your eyes;       When hollow hearts shall wear a mask         'Twill break your own to see:       In such a moment I but ask         That you'll remember me.    The song only added to Arline's distress. She could not let Thaddeus  go.    \"You must never leave me, Thaddeus,\" she cried.    \"Then will you fly with me?\" he begged.    \"It would kill my poor father; he has only now found me. I would go if  it were not for love of him, but how can I leave him?\" And while the  lovers were in this unhappy coil Devilshoof, who had been watching at  the window to warn them if any one was coming, called out:    \"Your doom is sealed in another moment! You must decide: people are  coming. There is no escape for you, Thaddeus.\"    \"Come into this cabinet,\" Arline cried in alarm. \"No one can find you  there! and you, Devilshoof, jump out of the window.\" No sooner said  than done! Out Devilshoof jumped, while Thaddeus got into the cabinet.  The great doors were thrown open and the company streamed in to  congratulate Arline on being restored to her father. The old Count  then took Arline by the hand and presented her to the company, while  Florestein, as the suitor who expected to be given her hand in  marriage, stood beside her, smiling and looking the coxcomb. Everybody  then sang a gay welcome, and Florestein, who seemed born only to do  that which was annoying to other people, picked up the forgotten gipsy  dress, declaring that it was not suitable to such a moment, and that  he would place it in the cabinet.    That was the worst possible thing he could do, and Arline watched him  with horror. If he should go to the cabinet, as she was now certain he  would, he could not possibly help finding Thaddeus. She watched with  excitement every moment; but in the midst of her fears there was a  great noise without, and the gipsy Queen forced her way in, to the  amazement of the company. She went at once to the old Count, who it  seemed was never to have done with surprises.    \"Who art thou, intruder?\" he asked angrily. Upon this the Queen lifted  her veil, which till then had concealed her face.    \"Behold me!\" she cried, very dramatically, \"heed my warning voice!  Wail and not rejoice!\" A nice sort of caution to be injected into a  merrymaking. \"The foe to thy rest, is the one you love best. Think not  my warning wild, 'tis thy refound child. She loves a youth of the  tribe I sway, and braves the world's reproof. List to the words I say,  he is now beneath thy roof!\" This was quite enough to drive the entire  company into hysterics.    \"Base wretch,\" the Count cried, \"thou liest!\"    \"Thy faith I begrudge, open that door and thyself be the judge,\" she  screamed, quite beside herself with anger. Of course everybody looked  toward the door of the cabinet, and finally the Count opened it, and  there stood Thaddeus.    He staggered back, the Queen was delighted, but everybody else was  frightened half to death.    Everybody concerned seemed then to be in the worst possible way.  Arline determined to stand by Thaddeus, and she was quite appalled at  the wickedness of the Queen.    \"Leave the place instantly,\" the Count roared to Thaddeus.    \"I go, Arline,\" Thaddeus answered sorrowfully.    \"Never!--unless I go with thee,\" she declared, quite overcome by the  situation. \"Father, I love thee, but I cannot give up Thaddeus,\" she  protested sorrowfully to the Count. Then the Count drew his sword and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication — Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"black bull, or  from a black cow by a red bull, are not rarely born red, and subsequently  become black. I possess a dog, the daughter of a white terrier by a fox-  coloured bulldog; as a puppy she was quite white, but when about six months  old a black spot appeared on her nose, and brown spots on her ears. When a  little older she was badly wounded on the back, and the hair which grew on the  cicatrix was of a brown colour, apparently derived from her father. This is  the more remarkable, as with most animals having coloured hair, that which  grows on a wounded surface is white.    In the foregoing cases, the characters which with advancing age reappeared,  were present in the immediately preceding generations; but characters  sometimes reappear in the same manner after a much longer interval of time.  Thus the calves of a hornless race of cattle which originated in Corrientes,  though at first quite hornless, as they become adult sometimes acquire small,  crooked, and loose horns; and these in succeeding years occasionally become  attached to the skull. (13/25. Azara 'Essais Hist. Nat. de Paraguay' tome 2  1801 page 372.) White and black Bantams, both of which generally breed true,  sometimes assume as they grow old a saffron or red plumage. For instance, a  first-rate black bantam has been described, which during three seasons was  perfectly black, but then annually became more and more red; and it deserves  notice that this tendency to change, whenever it occurs in a bantam, \"is  almost certain to prove hereditary.\" (13/26. These facts are given on the high  authority of Mr. Hewitt in 'The Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866 page  248.) The cuckoo or blue-mottled Dorking cock, when old, is liable to acquire  yellow or orange hackles in place of his proper bluish-grey hackles. (13/27.  'The Poultry Book' by Tegetmeier 1866 page 97.) Now as Gallus bankiva is  coloured red and orange, and as Dorking fowls and bantams are descended from  this species, we can hardly doubt that the change which occasionally occurs in  the plumage of these birds as their age advances, results from a tendency in  the individual to revert to the primitive type.    CROSSING AS A DIRECT CAUSE OF REVERSION.    It has long been notorious that hybrids and mongrels often revert to both or  to one of their parent-forms, after an interval of from two to seven or eight,  or, according to some authorities, even a greater number of generations. But  that the act of crossing in itself gives an impulse towards reversion, as  shown by the reappearance of long-lost characters, has never, I believe, been  hitherto proved. The proof lies in certain peculiarities, which do not  characterise the immediate parents, and therefore cannot have been derived  from them, frequently appearing in the offspring of two breeds when crossed,  which peculiarities never appear, or appear with extreme rarity, in these same  breeds, as long as they are precluded from crossing. As this conclusion seems  to me highly curious and novel, I will give the evidence in detail.    [My attention was first called to this subject, and I was led to make numerous  experiments, by MM. Boitard and Corbie having stated that, when they crossed  certain breeds of pigeons, birds coloured like the wild C. livia, or the  common dovecote--namely, slaty-blue, with double black wing-bars, sometimes  chequered with black, white loins, the tail barred with black, with the outer  feathers edged with white,--were almost invariably produced. The breeds which  I crossed, and the remarkable results attained, have been fully described in  the sixth chapter. I selected pigeons belonging to true and ancient breeds,  which had not a trace of blue or any of the above specified marks; but when  crossed, and their mongrels recrossed, young birds were often produced, more  or less plainly coloured slaty-blue, with some or all of the proper  characteristic marks. I may recall to the reader's memory one case, namely,  that of a pigeon, hardly distinguishable from the wild Shetland species, the  grandchild of a red-spot, white fantail, and two black barbs, from any of  which, when purely-bred, the production of a pigeon coloured like the wild C.  livia would have been almost a prodigy.    I was thus led to make the experiments, recorded in the seventh chapter, on  fowls. I selected long-established pure breeds, in which there was not a trace  of red, yet in several of the mongrels feathers of this colour appeared; and  one magnificent bird, the offspring of a black Spanish cock and white Silk  hen, was coloured almost exactly like the wild Gallus bankiva. All who know  anything of the breeding of poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure  Spanish and of pure white Silk fowls might have been reared without the  appearance of a red feather. The fact, given on the authority of Mr.  Tegetmeier, of the frequent appearance, in mongrel fowls, of pencilled or  transversely-barred feathers, like those common to many gallinaceous birds, is  likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character formerly possessed by  some ancient progenitor of the family. I owe to the kindness of this excellent  observer the opportunity of inspecting some neck-hackles and tail-feathers  from a hybrid between the common fowl and a very distinct species, the Gallus  varius; and these feathers are transversely striped in a conspicuous manner  with dark metallic blue and grey, a character which could not have been  derived from either immediate parent.    I have been informed by Mr. B.P. Brent, that he crossed a white Aylesbury  drake and a black so-called Labrador duck, both of which are true breeds, and  he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard (A. boschas). Of the musk-  duck (Cairina moschata, Linn.) there are two sub-breeds, namely, white and  slate-coloured; and these I am informed breed true, or nearly true. But the  Rev. W.D. Fox tells me that, by putting a white drake to a slate-coloured  duck, black birds, pied with white, like the wild musk-duck, were always  produced. I hear from Mr. Blyth that hybrids from the canary and gold-finch  almost always have streaked feathers on their backs; and this streaking must  be derived from the original wild canary.    We have seen in the fourth chapter, that the so-called Himalayan rabbit, with  its snow-white body, black ears, nose, tail, and feet, breeds perfectly true.  This race is known to have been formed by the union of two varieties of  silver-grey rabbits. Now, when a Himalayan doe was crossed by a sandy-coloured  buck, a silver-grey rabbit was produced; and this is evidently a case of  reversion to one of the parent varieties. The young of the Himalayan rabbit  are born snow-white, and the dark marks do not appear until some time  subsequently; but occasionally young Himalayan rabbits are born of a light  silver-grey, which colour soon disappears; so that here we have a trace of  reversion, during an early period of life, to the parent varieties,  independently of any recent cross.    In the third chapter it was shown that at an ancient period some breeds of  cattle in the wilder parts of Britain were white with dark ears, and that the  cattle now kept half wild in certain parks, and those which have run quite  wild in two distant parts of the world, are likewise thus coloured. Now, an  experienced breeder, Mr. J. Beasley, of Northamptonshire (13/28. 'Gardener's  Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette' 1866 page 528.), crossed some carefully  selected West Highland cows with purely-bred shorthorn bulls. The bulls were  red, red and white, or dark roan; and the Highland cows were all of a red  colour, inclining to a light or yellow shade. But a considerable number of the  offspring--and Mr. Beasley calls attention to this as a remarkable fact--were  white, or white with red ears. Bearing in mind that none of the parents were  white, and that they were purely-bred animals, it is highly probable that here  the offspring reverted, in consequence of the cross, to the colour of some  ancient and half-wild parent-breed. The following case, perhaps, comes under  the same head: cows in their natural state have their udders but little  developed, and do not yield nearly so much milk as our domesticated animals.  Now there is some reason to believe (13/29. Ibid 1860 page 343. I am glad to  find that so experienced a breeder of cattle as Mr. Willoughby Wood,  'Gardener's Chronicle' 1869 page 1216, admits my principle of a cross giving a  tendency to reversion.) that cross-bred animals between two kinds, both of  which are good milkers, such as Alderneys and Shorthorns, often turn out  worthless in this respect.    In the chapter on the Horse reasons were assigned for believing that the  primitive stock was striped and dun-coloured; and details were given, showing  that in all parts of the world stripes of a dark colour frequently appear  along the spine, across the legs, and on the shoulders, where they are  occasionally double or treble, and even sometimes on the face and body of  horses of all breeds and of all colours. But the stripes appear most  frequently on the various kinds of duns. In foals they are sometimes plainly  seen, and subsequently disappear. The dun-colour and the stripes are strongly  transmitted when a horse thus characterised is crossed with any other; but I  was not able to prove that striped duns are generally produced from the  crossing of two distinct breeds, neither of which are duns, though this does  sometimes occur.    The legs of the ass are often striped, and this may be considered as a  reversion to the wild parent form, the Equus taeniopus of Abyssinia (13/30.  Sclater in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page 163.), which is generally thus  striped. In the domestic animal the stripes on the shoulder are occasionally  double, or forked at the extremity, as in certain zebrine species. There is  reason to believe that the foal is more frequently"]]]
