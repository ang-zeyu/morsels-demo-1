Astronomy generalises the results of the other sciences. She exhibits  the laws of Nature working over a wider area, and under more varied  conditions, than ordinary experience presents. Ordinary experience, on  the other hand, has become indispensable to her progress. She takes in  at one view the indefinitely great and the indefinitely little. The  mutual revolutions of the stellar multitude during tracts of time which  seem to lengthen out to eternity as the mind attempts to traverse them,  she does not admit to be beyond her ken; nor is she indifferent to the  constitution of the minutest atom of matter that thrills the ether into  light. How she entered upon this vastly expanded inheritance, and how,  so far, she has dealt with it, is attempted to be set forth in the  ensuing chapters.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: The denomination \"physical astronomy,\" first used by  Kepler, and long appropriated to this branch of the science, has of late  been otherwise applied.]    [Footnote 2: _Histoire de l'Astronomie au xviii^e Siecle_, p. 267.]                                           PART I    PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY                                      CHAPTER I                       _FOUNDATION OF SIDEREAL ASTRONOMY_      Until nearly a hundred years ago the stars were regarded by practical  astronomers mainly as a number of convenient fixed points by which the  motions of the various members of the solar system could be determined  and compared. Their recognised function, in fact, was that of milestones  on the great celestial highway traversed by the planets, as well as on  the byways of space occasionally pursued by comets. Not that curiosity  as to their nature, and even conjecture as to their origin, were at any  period absent. Both were from time to time powerfully stimulated by the  appearance of startling novelties in a region described by philosophers  as \"incorruptible,\" or exempt from change. The catalogue of Hipparchus  probably, and certainly that of Tycho Brahe, some seventeen centuries  later, owed each its origin to the temporary blaze of a new star. The  general aspect of the skies was thus (however imperfectly) recorded from  age to age, and with improved appliances the enumeration was rendered  more and more accurate and complete; but the secrets of the stellar  sphere remained inviolate.    In a qualified though very real sense, Sir William Herschel may be  called the Founder of Sidereal Astronomy. Before his time some curious  facts had been noted, and some ingenious speculations hazarded,  regarding the condition of the stars, but not even the rudiments of  systematic knowledge had been acquired. The facts ascertained can be  summed up in a very few sentences.    Giordano Bruno was the first to set the suns of space in motion; but in  imagination only. His daring surmise was, however, confirmed in 1718,  when Halley announced[3] that Sirius, Aldebaran, Betelgeux, and Arcturus  had unmistakably shifted their quarters in the sky since Ptolemy  assigned their places in his catalogue. A similar conclusion was reached  by J. Cassini in 1738, from a comparison of his own observations with  those made at Cayenne by Richer in 1672; and Tobias Mayer drew up in  1756 a list showing the direction and amount of about fifty-seven proper  motions,[4] founded on star-places determined by Olaus Roemer fifty years  previously. Thus the stars were no longer regarded as \"fixed,\" but the  question remained whether the movements perceived were real or only  apparent; and this it was not yet found possible to answer. Already, in  the previous century, the ingenious Robert Hooke had suggested an  \"alteration of the very system of the sun,\"[5] to account for certain  suspected changes in stellar positions; Bradley in 1748, and Lambert in  1761, pointed out that such apparent displacements (by that time well  ascertained) were in all probability a combined effect of motions both  of sun and stars; and Mayer actually attempted the analysis, but without  result.    On the 13th of August, 1596, David Fabricius, an unprofessional  astronomer in East Friesland, saw in the neck of the Whale a star of the  third magnitude, which by October had disappeared. It was, nevertheless,  visible in 1603, when Bayer marked it in his catalogue with the Greek  letter Omicron, and was watched, in 1638-39, through its phases of  brightening and apparent extinction by a Dutch professor named  Holwarda.[6] From Hevelius this first-known periodical star received the  name of \"Mira,\" or the Wonderful, and Boulliaud in 1667 fixed the length  of its cycle of change at 334 days. It was not a solitary instance. A  star in the Swan was perceived by Janson in 1600 to show fluctuations of  light, and Montanari found in 1669 that Algol in Perseus shared the same  peculiarity to a marked degree. Altogether the class embraced in 1782  half-a-dozen members. When it is added that a few star-couples had been  noted in singularly, but it was supposed accidentally, close  juxtaposition, and that the failure of repeated attempts to measure  stellar parallaxes pointed to distances _at least_ 400,000 times that of  the earth from the sun,[7] the picture of sidereal science, when the  last quarter of the eighteenth century began, is practically complete.  It included three items of information: that the stars have motions,  real or apparent; that they are immeasurably remote; and that a few  shine with a periodically variable light. Nor were these scantily  collected facts ordered into any promise of further development. They  lay at once isolated and confused before the inquirer. They needed to be  both multiplied and marshalled, and it seemed as if centuries of patient  toil must elapse before any reliable conclusions could be derived from  them. The sidereal world was thus the recognised domain of far-reaching  speculations, which remained wholly uncramped by systematic research  until Herschel entered upon his career as an observer of the heavens.    The greatest of modern astronomers was born at Hanover, November 15,  1738. He was the fourth child of Isaac Herschel, a hautboy-player in the  band of the Hanoverian Guard, and was early trained to follow his  father's profession. On the termination, however, of the disastrous  campaign of 1757, his parents removed him from the regiment, there is  reason to believe, in a somewhat unceremonious manner. Technically,  indeed, he incurred the penalties of desertion, remitted--according to  the Duke of Sussex's statement to Sir George Airy--by a formal pardon  handed to him personally by George III. on his presentation in 1782.[8]  At the age of nineteen, then, his military service having lasted four  years, he came to England to seek his fortune. Of the life of struggle  and privation which ensued little is known beyond the circumstances that  in 1760 he was engaged in training the regimental band of the Durham  Militia, and that in 1765 he was appointed organist at Halifax. In the  following year he removed to Bath as oboist in Linley's orchestra, and  in October 1767 was promoted to the post of organist in the Octagon  Chapel. The tide of prosperity now began to flow for him. The most  brilliant and modish society in England was at that time to be met at  Bath, and the young Hanoverian quickly found himself a favourite and the  fashion in it. Engagements multiplied upon him. He became director of  the public concerts; he conducted oratorios, engaged singers, organised  rehearsals, composed anthems, chants, choral services, besides  undertaking private tuitions, at times amounting to thirty-five or even  thirty-eight lessons a week. He in fact personified the musical activity  of a place then eminently and energetically musical.    But these multifarious avocations did not take up the whole of his  thoughts. His education, notwithstanding the poverty of his family, had  not been neglected, and he had always greedily assimilated every kind of  knowledge that came in his way. Now that he was a busy and a prosperous  man, it might have been expected that he would run on in the deep  professional groove laid down for him. On the contrary, his passion for  learning seemed to increase with the diminution of the time available  for its gratification. He studied Italian, Greek, mathematics;  Maclaurin's Fluxions served to \"unbend his mind\"; Smith's Harmonics and  Optics and Ferguson's Astronomy were the nightly companions of his  pillow. What he read stimulated without satisfying his intellect. He  desired not only to know, but to discover. In 1772 he hired a small  telescope, and through it caught a preliminary glimpse of the rich and  varied fields in which for so many years he was to expatiate.  Henceforward the purpose of his life was fixed: it was to obtain \"a  knowledge of the construction of the heavens\";[9] and this sublime  ambition he cherished to the end.    A more powerful instrument was the first desideratum; and here his  mechanical genius came to his aid. Having purchased the apparatus of a  Quaker optician, he set about the manufacture of specula with a zeal  which seemed to anticipate the wonders they were to disclose to him. It  was not until fifteen years later that his grinding and polishing  machines were invented, so the work had at that time to be entirely done  by hand. During this tedious and laborious process (which could not be  interrupted without injury, and lasted on one occasion sixteen hours),  his strength was supported by morsels of food put into his mouth by his  sister,[10] and his mind amused by her reading aloud to him the Arabian  Nights, Don Quixote, or other light works. At length, after repeated  failures, he found himself provided with a reflecting telescope--a  5-1/2-foot Gregorian--of his own construction. A copy of his first  observation with it, on the great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28257"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 1 (#5)"],[1," into France have made the passage with infinitely  less difficulty than has been connected with the further passage by  land to the fighting lines; and the hundreds of thousands from  England, France, India, and Australia, which have assembled in the  Near East could not have covered the distances that they have covered,  if they had moved by land, in ten times the number of days they have  occupied in moving by sea. The sea being clear of enemy ships, the  route from Liverpool to the Dardanelles has been a lane for an easy  and pleasant promenade. With the Atlantic and Pacific controlled by  the fleets of nations at war with us, their waters would invite,  rather than impede, the movement of an army to our shores. It would be  difficult to exaggerate the significance of this lesson for the United  States.    A rather grewsome lesson, but one which cannot be ignored, is that  in a naval battle, there are, at the end, neither \"wounded\",  \"missing\", nor \"prisoners\" to be reported. A ship defeated is, and  will be, in a great majority of cases, a ship sunk; and sinking, she  will sink with all on board. Some few exceptions there may be, but  the rule can hardly fail to be as thus stated. One of the first  things that a ship does in preparing for battle is to get rid of her  boats; and, as both her companions and her opponents are sure to do  the same, her crew can neither help themselves nor look for help  from friends or enemies. The _Good Hope_ and the _Monmouth_ went  down in the battle off Coronel leaving not a single survivor to tell  the story of their destruction. Following the battle off the  Falkland Islands, the British picked up a few survivors from the  German ships, but not enough to contradict the rule. In the running  engagement in the North Sea on January 25, 1915, the _Bluecher_ went  down with 650 out of 900 of her crew. Scarcely a man was saved from  the _Cressy_, the _Aboukir_, or the _Hogue_. And so the story runs,  and so it must always run when modern ships fight in earnest.    One of the most striking features of the engagements up to the  present time is the range at which they have been fought. A few  years ago 10,000 yards was considered the extreme range at which  ships would open fire. The ranges used in the Russo-Japanese War  varied from 3,000 to 8,000 yards, and the battle off Tsushima was  decided at less than 6,000 yards. In the present war the ranges have  been nearly three times as great as these. In the battle off  Coronel, the _Good Hope_ was sunk at 12,000 yards, the _Monmouth_ at  a little less. In the battle off the Falkland Islands, both sides  opened fire at 17,000 yards, and the German ships were sunk at  approximately 16,000 yards. The running fight in the North Sea  opened at 18,000 yards, and the _Bluecher_ was sunk at 15,000 yards.  This extraordinary increase in the fighting range corresponds in a  measure to an increase in accuracy of fire, but it corresponds also  to a new recognition of the enormous advantage which may result from  a fortunate hit early in the action. The theoretical advantage which  should result from this has been confirmed by practical experience,  and it may be regarded as certain that battle ranges hereafter will  conform more nearly to those off Coronel than to those of Tsushima.    To summarize: The great outstanding naval lesson of the war is this:  That a nation whose navy commands the sea can rest secure, so far as  its sea frontier is concerned, from the fear of invasion or of  serious attack; that, further, its command of the sea insures to its  commerce the freedom of the sea; and that, finally, this freedom  extends equally to its armed forces, to which the highways of the  sea are opened wide, affording a possibility of offense at distant  points which is denied to the forces of the enemy.    Perhaps the lesson second in importance is that, owing to the rapid  march of invention in these days of progress, it is to be expected  that every war which comes suddenly upon the world will come with  certain elements of surprise, some of them startling in their power  and effectiveness, some of them giving promise of much and  accomplishing comparatively little. However surprising and however  effective the best of these may be, they will fall short of  revolutionizing warfare, but they may profoundly modify it; and the  nation which has them ready for use in the beginning will gain an  initial advantage which may go far toward determining the issue of  the war.    Lessons of more limited significance have to do with the  effectiveness of the submarine and the unexpected radius of action  of which it has shown itself capable; the amazing destructive power  of the torpedo; the value of the battle cruiser, both for the  defense of a coast from raiding expeditions, and for operations in  distant seas where speed is needed to bring an enemy to action, and  heavy guns to insure his destruction; the difficulty of reducing  shore fortifications by fire from ships; the necessity of aeroplanes  for scouting at sea, and the modifications in naval strategy and  tactics which will result from their general adoption.    After many months of sparring between the British and German naval  forces in the North Sea, an important engagement took place on May  31, 1916, between the two main fleets. Exactly what forces were  engaged will probably not be known until the end of the war, and it  is certain that we must wait long for definitely reliable reports as  to the losses on the two sides. It is already clear, however, that  the encounter has added little to our knowledge of naval warfare.  British battle cruisers engaged German battleships at close range  and were badly punished. In this there was nothing new or  instructive. Nor has anything new or instructive developed from what  is thus far known of other phases of the battle. Indeed the one and  only striking feature of the battle appears to be the fact that  everything occurred practically as it might have been expected to  occur. Neither submarines nor destroyers, neither Zeppelins nor  aeroplanes provided any startling features. The only lesson thus far  apparent is the old one that while dash and audacity have their  place in warfare, they need the directing and steadying hand of  judgment and of skill.          THE WORLD'S WAR    By FREDERICK PALMER          INITIAL STRATEGY      In innumerable volumes future generations will learn the details of  this war: and the discussions among delving historians will never  end. For our time a simpler task is the service set for us. We  require a record of the essential facts of the struggle arranged  with a sense of historical perspective.    For forty years the great nations of Europe had had universal  service. Every able-bodied youth, unless his government chose to  excuse him, became a soldier. For forty years the diplomatists had  held the balance of power so delicately poised that the mighty armed  forces all kept to their own sides of their frontiers. It was in the  era of modern invention and man's mastery of material power that  these great armies were formed and trained for the war that was to  test their steel.    Where Napoleon marched a hundred thousand men along parallel roads,  the modern general sends his millions on railroad trains. The  problem for each nation when war came was to concentrate with a  greater rapidity than its adversary its enormous masses of men and  guns against the enemy; and success in this was not due as in former  days to speed of foot over good highways such as the Romans and  Napoleon built, but to organized railroad and automobile transport  or rather the prompt employment of all the industrial resources of  the nation for war alone.    Out of the conflicting reports day by day emerge to the observer as  he reviews the progress of the war, with the map before him, plans  of campaign as simple in their broad lines as in Caesar's or  Alexander's day. Generals fighting with a million or two million men  under their command have held to the same principles as if they had  only ten or fifteen thousand.    All schools of successful warfare have believed in the offensive; in  quick decisive blows which take the enemy by surprise and find him  unready if possible. They hold that the army in rest must always be  beaten by the army which takes the initiative. This partly explains  the frequent small actions indicated by the reports of trenches  taken in assault along the western front, while the lines occupied  by the armies did not radically change. Such actions are the natural  expression by any spirited force of its sense of initiative. Unless  you sometimes take some of the enemy's trenches, he will be taking  yours. By striking him in one section you may prevent him from  striking you in another. Von Moltke and the other great German  generals were only following in the footsteps of Napoleon when they  taught that the offensive should be the first thought of every  soldier.    The offensive naturally seeks to flank its adversary. Lieutenant  General Winfield Scott once stated that if two lines of men, without  any officers, were placed in a field, one line would inevitably try  to get around the end of the other. The immensity of the forces, the  power and precision of modern armies in defense has lengthened the  battle fronts from a mile or a mile and a half in Napoleon's time to  hundreds of miles.    It is an old rule, that you cannot break through a battle front,  which means that you are thrusting in a wedge which will draw fire  on both sides. Pickett tried to break a battle front at Gettysburg.  A frontal attack which was no less pitiful in its results was that  of the Federals at Fredericksburg. Grant's hammering tactics against  Lee succeeded only by the flanking operations of superior numbers.    Strategically, the situation of the Central Powers was extremely  strong. Aside from the fact that their"]]]
