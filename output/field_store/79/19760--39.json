[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22728"],[0,"The Foundations of the Origin of Species (#5)"],[1,"called attention in footnotes to many points in which the  _Origin_ agrees with the _Foundations_. One of the most interesting is  the final sentence, practically the same in the Essays of 1842 and 1844,  and almost identical with the concluding words of the _Origin_. I have  elsewhere pointed out{35} that the ancestry of this eloquent passage may  be traced one stage further back,--to the Note Book of 1837. I have  given this sentence as an appropriate motto for the _Foundations_ in its  character of a study of general laws. It will be remembered that a  corresponding motto from Whewell's _Bridgewater Treatise_ is printed  opposite the title-page of the _Origin of Species_.         {35} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 9.    Mr Huxley who, about the year 1887, read the Essay of 1844, remarked  that \"much more weight is attached to the influence of external  conditions in producing variation and to the inheritance of acquired  habits than in the _Origin_.\" In the _Foundations_ the effect of  conditions is frequently mentioned, and Darwin seems to have had  constantly in mind the need of referring each variation to a cause. But  I gain the impression that the slighter prominence given to this view in  the _Origin_ was not due to change of opinion, but rather because he had  gradually come to take this view for granted; so that in the scheme of  that book, it was overshadowed by considerations which then seemed to  him more pressing. With regard to the inheritance of acquired characters  I am not inclined to agree with Huxley. It is certain that the  _Foundations_ contains strong recognition of the importance of germinal  variation, that is of external conditions acting indirectly through the  \"reproductive functions.\" He evidently considered this as more important  than the inheritance of habit or other acquired peculiarities.    Another point of interest is the weight he attached in 1842-4 to  \"sports\" or what are now called \"mutations.\" This is I think more  prominent in the _Foundations_ than in the first edition of the  _Origin_, and certainly than in the fifth and sixth editions.    Among other interesting points may be mentioned the \"good effects of  crossing\" being \"possibly analogous to good effects of change in  condition,\"--a principle which he upheld on experimental grounds in his  _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_ in 1876.    In conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to Mr Wallace for a  footnote he was good enough to supply: and to Professor Bateson, Sir W.  Thiselton-Dyer, Dr Gadow, Professor Judd, Dr Marr, Col. Prain and Dr  Stapf for information on various points. I am also indebted to Mr  Rutherford, of the University Library, for his careful copy of the  manuscript of 1842.

[] Means that the words so enclosed are erased in the original MS.    <> Indicates an insertion by the Editor.    _Origin_, Ed. vi. refers to the Popular Edition.          PART I.      Sec. I. <ON VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION, AND ON THE PRINCIPLES OF  SELECTION.>    An individual organism placed under new conditions [often] sometimes  varies in a small degree and in very trifling respects such as stature,  fatness, sometimes colour, health, habits in animals and probably  disposition. Also habits of life develope certain parts. Disuse  atrophies. [Most of these slight variations tend to become hereditary.]    When the individual is multiplied for long periods by buds the variation  is yet small, though greater and occasionally a single bud or individual  departs widely from its type (example){36} and continues steadily to  propagate, by buds, such new kind.         {36} Evidently a memorandum that an example should be given.    When the organism is bred for several generations under new or varying  conditions, the variation is greater in amount and endless in kind  [especially{37} holds good when individuals have long been exposed to  new conditions]. The nature of the external conditions tends to effect  some definite change in all or greater part of offspring,--little food,  small size--certain foods harmless &c. &c. organs affected and  diseases--extent unknown. A certain degree of variation (Mueller's  twins){38} seems inevitable effect of process of reproduction. But more  important is that simple <?> generation, especially under new conditions  [when no crossing] <causes> infinite variation and not direct effect of  external conditions, but only in as much as it affects the reproductive  functions{39}. There seems to be no part (_beau ideal_ of liver){40} of  body, internal or external, or mind or habits, or instincts which does  not vary in some small degree and [often] some <?> to a great amount.         {37} The importance of exposure to new conditions for several       generations is insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 7, also p.       131. In the latter passage the author guards himself against the       assumption that variations are \"due to chance,\" and speaks of \"our       ignorance of the cause of each particular variation.\" These       statements are not always remembered by his critics.         {38} Cf. _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 10, vi. p. 9, \"Young of the same       litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both       the young and the parents, as Mueller has remarked, have apparently       been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life.\"         {39} This is paralleled by the conclusion in the _Origin_, Ed. i.       p. 8, that \"the most frequent cause of variability may be       attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been       affected prior to the act of conception.\"         {40} The meaning seems to be that there must be some variability in       the liver otherwise anatomists would not speak of the 'beau ideal'       of that organ.    [All such] variations [being congenital] or those very slowly acquired  of all kinds [decidedly evince a tendency to become hereditary], when  not so become simple variety, when it does a race. Each{41} parent  transmits its peculiarities, therefore if varieties allowed freely to  cross, except by the _chance_ of two characterized by same peculiarity  happening to marry, such varieties will be constantly demolished{42}.  All bisexual animals must cross, hermaphrodite plants do cross, it seems  very possible that hermaphrodite animals do cross,--conclusion  strengthened: ill effects of breeding in and in, good effects of  crossing possibly analogous to good effects of change in condition <?>{43}.         {41} The position of the following passage is uncertain. \"If       individuals of two widely different varieties be allowed to cross,       a third race will be formed--a most fertile source of the variation       in domesticated animals. <In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 20 the author       says that \"the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has       been greatly exaggerated.\"> If freely allowed, the characters of       pure parents will be lost, number of races thus <illegible> but       differences <?> besides the <illegible>. But if varieties differing       in very slight respects be allowed to cross, such small variation       will be destroyed, at least to our senses,--a variation [clearly]       just to be distinguished by long legs will have offspring not to be       so distinguished. Free crossing great agent in producing uniformity       in any breed. Introduce tendency to revert to parent form.\"         {42} The swamping effect of intercrossing is referred to in the       _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 103, vi. p. 126.         {43} A discussion on the intercrossing of hermaphrodites in       relation to Knight's views occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 96,       vi. p. 119. The parallelism between crossing and changed conditions       is briefly given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 267, vi. p. 391, and       was finally investigated in _The Effects of Cross and       Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom_, 1876.    Therefore if in any country or district all animals of one species be  allowed freely to cross, any small tendency in them to vary will be  constantly counteracted. Secondly reversion to parent form--analogue of  _vis medicatrix_{44}. But if man selects, then new races rapidly  formed,--of late years systematically followed,--in most ancient times  often practically followed{45}. By such selection make race-horse,  dray-horse--one cow good for tallow, another for eating &c.--one plant's  good lay <illegible> in leaves another in fruit &c. &c.: the same plant  to supply his wants at different times of year. By former means animals  become adapted, as a direct effect to a cause, to external conditions,  as size of body to amount of food. By this latter means they may also be  so adapted, but further they may be adapted to ends and pursuits, which  by no possibility can affect growth, as existence of tallow-chandler  cannot tend to make fat. In such selected races, if not removed to new  conditions, and <if> preserved from all cross, after several generations  become very true, like each other and not varying. But man{46} selects  only <?> what is useful and curious--has bad judgment, is  capricious,--grudges to destroy those that do not come up to his  pattern,--has no [knowledge] power of selecting according to internal  variations,--can hardly keep his conditions uniform,--[cannot] does not  select those best adapted to the conditions under which <the> form <?> lives,  but those most useful to him. This might all be otherwise.         {44} There is an article on the _vis medicatrix_ in Brougham's       _Dissertations_, 1839, a copy of which is in the author's library.         {45} This is the classification of selection into methodical and       unconscious given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 33, vi. p. 38.         {46} This passage, and a similar discussion on the power of the       Creator (p. 6), correspond to the comparison between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#5)"],[1,"your auto, you came a shorter  way, ahead of me.  You hauled the log across the foot of the hill,  hoping, I suppose, that my machine would be broken.  But, let me tell  you, it was a risky trick.  Not only might I have been killed, but so  would whoever else who happened to drive down the slope over the log,  whether in a wagon or automobile.  Fortunately Eradicate discovered it  in time and warned me.  I ought to have you arrested, but you're not  worth it.  A good thrashing is what such sneaks as you deserve!\"    \"You haven't got any evidence against us,\" sneered Andy confidently,  his old bravado coming back.    \"I have all I want,\" replied Tom.  \"You needn't worry.  I'm not going  to tell the police.  But you've got to do one thing or I'll make you  sorry you ever tried this trick.  Eradicate will help me, so don't  think you're going to escape.\"    \"You get out of my automobile!\" demanded Andy.  \"I'll have you arrested  if you don't.\"    \"I'll get out because I'm ready to, but not on account of your  threats,\" retorted Mr. Swift's son.  \"Here's your wrench.  Now I want  you and Sam to start up this machine and haul that log out of the way.\"    \"S'pose I won't do it?\" snapped Andy.    \"Then I'll cause your arrest, besides thrashing you into the bargain!  You can take your choice of removing the log so travelers can pass or  having a good hiding, you and Sam.  Eradicate, you take Sam and I'll  tackle Andy.\"    \"Don't you dare touch me!\" cried the bully, but there was a whine in  his tones.    \"You let me alone or I'll tell my father!\" added Sam.  \"I--I didn't  have nothin' to do with it, anyhow.  I told Andy it would make trouble,  but he made me help him.\"    \"Say, what's the matter with you?\" demanded Andy indignantly of his  crony.  \"Do you want to--\"    \"I wish I'd never come with you,\" went on Sam, who was beginning to be  frightened.    \"Come now.  Start up that machine and haul the log out of the way,\"  demanded Tom again.    \"I won't do it!\" retorted the red-haired lad impudently.    \"Yes, you will,\" insisted our hero, and he took a step toward the  bully.  They were out of the clump of bushes now and in the roadside  ditch.  \"You let me alone,\" almost screamed Andy, and in his baffled  rage he rushed at Tom, aiming a blow.    The young inventor quickly stepped to one side, and, as the bully  passed him, Tom sent out a neat left-hander.  Andy Foger went down in a  heap on the grass.          CHAPTER V    A TEST OF SPEED      Whether Tom or Andy was the most surprised at the happening would be  hard to say.  The former had not meant to hit so hard and he certainly  did not intend to knock the squint-eyed youth down.  The latter's fall  was due, as much as anything, to his senseless, rushing tactics and to  the fact that he slipped on the green grass.  The bully was up in a  moment, however, but he knew better than to try conclusions with Tom  again.  Instead he stood out of reach and spluttered:    \"You just wait, Tom Swift! You just wait!\"    \"Well, I'm waiting,\" responded the other calmly.    \"I'll get even with you,\" went on Andy.  \"You think you're smart  because you got ahead of me, but I'll get square!\"    \"Look here!\" burst out the young inventor determinedly, taking a step  toward his antagonist, at which Andy quickly retreated, \"I don't want  any more of that talk from you, Andy Foger.  That's twice you've made  threats against me to-day.  You put that log across the road, and if  you try anything like it for your second attempt I'll make you wish you  hadn't.  That applies to you, too, Sam,\" he added, glancing at the  other lad.    \"I--I ain't gone' to do nothin',\" declared Sam.    \"I told Andy not to put that tree--\"    \"Keep still, can't you!\" shouted the bully.  \"Come on.  We'll get even  with him, that's all,\" he muttered as he went back into the bushes  where the auto was.  Andy cranked up and he and his crony getting into  the car were about to start off.    \"Hold on!\" cried Tom.  \"You'll take that log from across the road or  I'll have you arrested for obstructing traffic, and that's a serious  offense.\"    \"I'm goin' to take it away!\" growled Andy.  \"Give a fellow a show can't  you?\"    He cast an ugly look at Tom, but the latter only smiled.  It was no  easy task for Sam and Andy to pull the log out of the way, as they  could hardly lift it to slip the rope under.  But they finally managed  it, and, by the power of the car, hauled it to one side.  Then they  speed off.    \"I 'clar t' gracious, dem young fellers am most as mean an' contrary as  mah mule Boomerang am sometimes,\" observed Eradicate.  \"Only Boomerang  ain't quite so mean as dat.\"    \"I should hope not, Rad,\" observed Tom.  \"I'm ever so much obliged for  your warning.  I guess I'll be getting, home now.  Come around next  week; we have some work for you.\"    \"'Deed an' I will,\" replied the colored man.  \"I'll come around an'  eradicate all de dirt on yo' place, Mistah Swift.  Yais, sah, I's  Eradicate by name, and dat's my perfession--eradicatin' dirt.  Much  obleeged, I'll call around.  Giddap, Boomerang!\"    The mule lazily flicked his ears, but did not stir, and Tom, knowing  the process of arousing the animal would take some time, hurried up the  hill to where he had left his motor-cycle.  Eradicate was still engaged  on the task of trying to arouse his steed to a sense of its duty when  the young inventor flashed by on his way home.    \"So now you own a broken motor-boat,\" observed Mr. Swift when Tom had  related the circumstances of the auction.  \"Well, now you have it, what  are you going to do with it?\"    \"Fix it, first of all,\" replied his son.  \"It needs considerable  tinkering up, but nothing but what I can do, if you'll help me.\"    \"Of course I will.  Do you think you can get any speed out of it?\"    \"Well, I'm not so anxious for speed.  I want a good, comfortable boat,  and the ARROW will be that.  I've named it, you see.  I'm going back to  Lanton this afternoon, take some tools along, and repair it so I can  run the boat over to here.  Then I'll get at it and fix it up.  I've  got a plan for you, dad.\"    \"What is it?\" asked the inventor, his rather tired face lighting up  with interest.    \"I'm going to take you on a vacation trip.\"    \"A vacation trip?\"    \"Yes, you need a rest.  You've been working too hard over that  gyroscope invention.\"    \"Yes, Tom, I think I have,\" admitted Mr. Swift.  \"But I am very much  interested in it, and I think I can get it to work.  If I do it will  make a great difference in the control of aeroplanes.  It will make  them more stable and able to fly in almost any wind.  But I certainly have  puzzled my brains over some features of it.  However, I don't quite see  what you mean.\"    \"You need a rest, dad,\" said Mr. Swift's son kindly.  \"I want you to  forget all about patents, invention, machinery and even the gyroscope  for a week or two.  When I get my motor-boat in shape I'm going to take  you and Ned Newton up the lake for a cruise.  We can camp out, or, if  we had to, we could sleep in the boat.  I'm going to put a canopy on it  and arrange some bunks.  It will do you good and perhaps new ideas for  your gyroscope may come to you after a rest.\"    \"Perhaps they will, Tom.  I am certainly tired enough to need a  vacation.  It's very kind of you to think of me in connection with your  boat.  But if you're going to get it this afternoon you'd better start  if you expect to get back by night.  I think Mrs. Baggert has dinner  ready.\"    After the meal Tom selected a number of tools from his own particular  machine shop and carried them down to the dock on the lake, where his  two small boats were tied.    \"Aren't you going back on your motor-cycle?\" asked his father.    \"No, Dad, I'm going to row over to Lanton, and, if I can get the ARROW  fixed, I'll tow my rowboat back.\"    \"Very well, then you won't be in any danger from Andy Foger.  I must  speak to his father about him.\"    \"No, dad, don't,\" exclaimed the young inventor quickly.  \"I can fight  my own battles with Andy.  I don't fancy he will bother me again right  away.\"    Tom found it more of a task than he had anticipated to get the motor in  shape to run the ARROW back under her own power.  The magneto was out  of order and the batteries needed renewing, while the spark coil had  short-circuited and took considerable time to adjust.  But by using  some new dry cells, which Mr. Hastings gave him, and cutting out the  magneto, or small dynamo which produces the spark that exploded the  gasoline in the cylinders, Tom soon had a fine, \"fat\" hot spark from  the auxiliary ignition system.  Then, adjusting the timer and throttle  on the engine and seeing that the gasoline tank was filled, the lad  started up his motor.  Mr. Hastings helped him, but after a few turns  of the flywheel there were no explosions.  Finally, after the  carburetor (which is the device where gasoline is mixed with air to  produce an explosive mixture) had been adjusted, the motor started off  as if it had intended to do so all the while and was only taking its  time about it.    \"The machine doesn't run as smooth as it ought to,\" commented Mr.  Hastings.  \"No, it needs a thorough overhauling,\" agreed the owner of  the ARROW.  \"I'll get at it to-morrow,\" and with that he swung out into  the lake, towing his rowboat after him.    \"A motor-boat of my own!\" exulted Tom as he twirled the steering wheel  and noted how readily the craft answered her helm.  \"This is great!\"    He steered down the lake and then, turning around, went up it a mile or  more before heading for his own dock, as he wanted to see how the  engine behaved.    \"With some changes and adjustments I can make this a speedy boat,\"  thought Tom.  \"I'll get right at it.  I shouldn't wonder if I could  make a good showing against Mr. Hastings' new CARLOPA, though his  boat's got four cylinders and mine has but two.\"    The lad was proceeding leisurely along the lakeshore, near his "]]]
