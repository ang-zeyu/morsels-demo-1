[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27638"],[0,"The 2001 CIA World Factbook (#5)"],[1,"coordinates  This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the  purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and  is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August  1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.    Geographic names  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of  Geographic Names.  It includes a listing of various alternate names,  former names, local names, and regional names referenced to one or more  related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but not always, those  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names and  additional information are included in parentheses.    Geography  This category includes the entries dealing with the natural environment  and the effects of human activity.    Geography - note  This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    GNP  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic  production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather  than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad  may be important to national well-being.    Government  This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the  adoption and administration of public policy.    Government type  This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g., republic,  constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary democracy,  military dictatorship).    Government - note  This entry includes miscellaneous government information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Gross domestic product  see GDP    Gross national product  see GNP    Gross world product  see GWP    GWP  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value of  all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Heliports  This entry gives the total number of established helicopter takeoff and  landing sites (which may or may not have fuel or other services).    Highways  This entry includes the total length of the highway system as well as  the length of the paved and unpaved components.    HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate  This entry gives an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged 15-49)  living with HIV/AIDS. The adult prevalence rate is calculated by  dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend  by the total adult population at yearend.    HIV/AIDS - deaths  This entry gives an estimate of the number of adults and children who  died of AIDS during a given calendar year.    HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS  This entry gives an estimate of all people (adults and children) alive  at yearend with HIV infection, whether or not they have developed  symptoms of AIDS.    Household income or consumption by percentage share  Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different  standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys  based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than  surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with  time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country  comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes  see Data codes    Illicit drugs  This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs -  narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and  cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold  outside of medical channels.         Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which  provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes  marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).         Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain  the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with  cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate,  cocoa, and cocoa butter.         Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.         Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety  and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,  phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone  (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,  Valmid).         Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.         Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance  that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment  in an individual.         Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-  awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),  mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants  (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine  analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).         Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).         Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.         Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical  depressant.         Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant  (Cannabis sativa).         Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as  mandrax in Southwest Asia and Africa.         Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and  refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural  narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin,  Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine,  Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin  (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics  include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone  (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).         Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod  of the opium poppy.         Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.         Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature,  dried opium poppy.         Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha  edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.         Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a  pharmaceutical depressant.         Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy  and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines  (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,  Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others  (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).    Imports  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of imports on a c.i.f.  (cost, insurance, and freight) or f.o.b. (free on board) basis.    Imports - commodities  This entry provides a rank ordering of imported products starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Imports - partners  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Independence  For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was  achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the other  countries, the date given may not represent \"independence\" in the  strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the form of  government, or state succession. Dependent areas include the notation  \"none\" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see the  Terminology note.    Industrial production growth rate  This entry gives the annual percentage increase in industrial  production (includes manufacturing, mining, and construction).    Industries  This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting with the  largest by value of annual output.    Infant mortality rate  This entry gives the number of deaths of infants under one year old in  a given year per 1,000 live births in the same year. This rate is often  used as an indicator of the level of health in a country.    Inflation rate (consumer prices)  This entry furnishes the annual percent change in consumer prices  compared with the previous year's consumer prices.    Internet country code  This entry includes the two-letter codes maintained by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the ISO 3166  Alpha-2 list and used by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)  to establish country-coded top-level domains (ccTLDs).    Internet Service Providers (ISPs)  This entry supplies the number of Internet Service Providers within a  country. An ISP is defined as a company that provides access to the  Internet.    Internet users  This entry gives the number of users within a country that access the  Internet.  Statistics vary from country to country and may include  users who access the Internet at least several times a week to those  who access it only once within a period of several months.

Algiers' efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned    economies in the Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world    oil prices plunged the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the    government launched a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to    achieve economic stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms    into the economy. Despite substantial progress toward economic    adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became    embroiled in political turmoil. In September 1993, a new government    was formed, and one priority was the resumption and acceleration of    the structural adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world    oil prices and burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded    a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994. Following    a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995 and a robust harvest, the    economy experienced a strong recovery and key economic improvements.
