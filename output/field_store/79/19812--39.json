Under the  pressure of this tyranny a great number of these colonists, largely  Scotch by original nationality and Presbyterian by religion, left Ulster  for America. They poured into the Carolinas, North and South, as well as  into Pennsylvania and Virginia, and overflowed into a new colony which  was established further west and named Georgia. It is important to note  this element in the colonization of the Southern States, because it is  too often loosely suggested that the later division of North and South  corresponded to the division of Cavalier and Puritan. It is not so.  Virginia and Maryland may be called Cavalier in their origin, but in the  Carolinas and Georgia there appears a Puritan tradition, not indeed as  fanatical as that of New England, but almost as persistent. Moreover  this Scotch-Irish stock, whose fathers, it may be supposed, left Ireland  in no very good temper with the rulers of Great Britain, afterwards  supplied the most military and the most determined element in  Washington's armies, and gave to the Republic some of its most striking  historical personalities: Patrick Henry and John Caldwell Calhoun,  Jackson, the great President, and his namesake the brilliant soldier of  the Confederacy.    The English colonies now formed a solid block extending from the coasts  of Maine--into which northernmost region the New England colonies had  overflown--to the borders of Florida. Florida was still a Spanish  possession, but Spain had ceased to be formidable as a rival or enemy of  England. By the persistence of a century in arms and diplomacy, the  French had worn down the Spanish power, and France was now easily the  strongest nation in Europe. France also had a foothold, or rather two  footholds, in North America. One of her colonies, Louisiana, lay beyond  Florida at the mouth of the Mississippi; the other, Canada, to the north  of the Maine, at the mouth of the St. Lawrence. It was the aim of French  colonial ambition to extend both colonies inland into the unmapped heart  of the American continent until they should meet. This would necessarily  have had the effect of hemming in the English settlements on the  Atlantic seaboard and preventing their Western expansion. Throughout the  first half of the eighteenth century, therefore, the rivalry grew more  and more acute, and even when France and England were at peace the  French and English in America were almost constantly at war. Their  conflict was largely carried on under cover of alliances with the  warring Indian tribes, whose feuds kept the region of the Great Lakes in  a continual turmoil. The outbreak of the Seven Years' War and the  intervention of England as an ally of Prussia put an end to the  necessity for such pretexts, and a regular military campaign opened upon  which was staked the destiny of North America.    It is not necessary for the purposes of this book to follow that  campaign in detail. The issue was necessarily fought out in Canada, for  Louisiana lay remote from the English colonies and was separated from  them by the neutral territory of the Spanish Empire. England had  throughout the war the advantage of superiority at sea, which enabled  her to supply and reinforce her armies, while the French forces were  practically cut off from Europe. The French, on the other hand, had at  the beginning the advantage of superior numbers, at least so far as  regular troops were concerned, while for defensive purposes they  possessed an excellent chain of very strong fortresses carefully  prepared before the war. After the earlier operations, which cleared the  French invaders out of the English colonies, the gradual reduction of  these strongholds practically forms the essence of the campaign  undertaken by a succession of English generals under the political  direction of the elder Pitt. That campaign was virtually brought to a  close by the brilliant exploit of James Wolfe in 1759--the taking of  Quebec. By the Treaty of Paris in 1763 Canada was ceded to England.  Meanwhile Louisiana had been transferred to Spain in 1762 as part of the  price of a Spanish alliance, and France ceased to be a rival to England  on the American continent.    During the French war the excellent professional army which England was  able to maintain in the field was supported by levies raised from the  English colonies, which did good service in many engagements. Among the  officers commanding these levies one especially had attracted, by his  courage and skill, and notably by the part he bore in the clearing of  Pennsylvania, the notice of his superiors--George Washington of  Virginia.    England was now in a position to develop in peace the empire which her  sword had defended with such splendid success and glory. Before we  consider the causes which so suddenly shattered that empire, it is  necessary to take a brief survey of its geography and of its economic  conditions.    The colonies, as we have seen, were spread along the Atlantic seaboard  to an extent of well over a thousand miles, covering nearly twenty  degrees of latitude. The variations of climate were naturally great, and  involved marked differentiations in the character and products of  labour. The prosperity of the Southern colonies depended mainly upon two  great staple industries. Raleigh, in the course of his voyages, had  learned from the Indians the use of the tobacco plant and had introduced  that admirable discovery into Europe. As Europe learned (in spite of the  protests of James I.) to prize the glorious indulgence now offered to  it, the demand for tobacco grew, and its supply became the principal  business of the colonies of Virginia and Maryland. Further to the south  a yet more important and profitable industry was established. The  climate of the Carolinas and of Georgia and of the undeveloped country  west of these colonies, a climate at once warm and humid, was found to  be exactly suited to the cultivation of the cotton plant. This proved  the more important when the discoveries of Watt and Arkwright gave  Lancashire the start of all the world in the manipulation of the cotton  fabric. From that moment begins the triumphant progress of \"King  Cotton,\" which was long to outlast the political connection between the  Carolinas and Lancashire, and was to give in the political balance of  America peculiar importance to the \"Cotton States.\"    But at the time now under consideration these cotton-growing territories  were still under the British Crown, and were subject to the Navigation  Laws upon which England then mainly relied for the purpose of making her  colonies a source of profit to her. The main effect of these was to  forbid the colonies to trade with any neighbour save the mother country.  This condition, to which the colonists seem to have offered no  opposition, gave to the British manufacturers the immense advantage of  an unrestricted supply of raw material to which no foreigner had access.  It is among the curious ironies of history that the prosperity of  Lancashire, which was afterwards to be identified with Free Trade, was  originally founded upon this very drastic and successful form of  Protection.    The more northerly colonies had no such natural advantages. The bulk of  the population lived by ordinary farming, grew wheat and the hard  cereals and raised cattle. But during the eighteenth century England  herself was still an exporting country as regards these commodities, and  with other nations the colonists were forbidden to trade. The Northern  colonies had, therefore, no considerable export commerce, but on the  seaboard they gradually built up a considerable trade as carriers, and  Boston and New York merchant captains began to have a name on the  Atlantic for skill and enterprise. Much of the transoceanic trade passed  into their hands, and especially one most profitable if not very  honourable trade of which, by the Treaty of Utrecht, England had  obtained a virtual monopoly--the trade in Negro slaves.    The pioneer of this traffic had been Sir John Hawkins, one of the  boldest of the great Elizabethan sailors. He seems to have been the  first of the merchant adventurers to realize that it might prove  profitable to kidnap Negroes from the West Coast of Africa and sell them  into slavery in the American colonies. The cultivation of cotton and  tobacco in the Southern plantations, as of sugar in the West Indies,  offered a considerable demand for labour of a type suitable to the  Negro. The attempt to compel the native Indians to such labour had  failed; the Negro proved more tractable. By the time with which we are  dealing the whole industry of the Southern colonies already rested upon  servile coloured labour.    In the Northern colonies--that is, those north of Maryland--the Negro  slave existed, but only casually, and, as it were, as a sort of  accident. Slavery was legal in all the colonies--even in Pennsylvania,  whose great founder had been almost alone in that age in disapproving of  it. As for the New England Puritans, they had from the first been quite  enthusiastic about the traffic, in which indeed they were deeply  interested as middle-men; and Calvinist ministers of the purest  orthodoxy held services of thanksgiving to God for cargoes of poor  barbarians rescued from the darkness of heathendom and brought (though  forcibly) into the gospel light. But though the Northerners had no more  scruple about Slavery than the Southerners, they had far less practical  use for it. The Negro was of no value for the sort of labour in which  the New Englanders engaged; he died of it in the cold climate. Negro  slaves there were in all the Northern States, but mostly employed as  domestic servants or in casual occupations. They were a luxury, not a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#5)"],[1,"unded, oval, ellipsoidal, narrow and cylindrical, oblong terete  or furrowed. There is considerable variation as regards the colour also.    The =embryo= consists of an =axis= and a =scutellum=. The axis, which is  differentiated into the plumule directed upward and the radicle  downward, is small and straight and it is covered more or less by the  edges of the scutellum. The scutellum is attached to the axis at about  its middle and its outer surface is in contact with the endosperm. This  is an important organ as its function is to absorb nourishment from the  endosperm during germination. The scutellum is considered to represent  the first leaf or cotyledon. The endosperm consists mostly of starch.  Just outside the endosperm and within the epidermis lies a layer of  cells containing much proteid substance. This layer is called the  =aleurone layer=. (See fig. 21.) As an illustration of the caryopsis,  the grain of Andropogon Sorghum may be studied. All the structural  details are shown in fig. 20 which is a longitudinal section of the  grain.    The primary axis of the embryo is enclosed by a closed sheath both above  and below. The sheath which envelopes the radicle is called =coleorhiza=  and that of the plumule, =pileole= or =germ-sheath=.          CHAPTER IV.    HISTOLOGY OF THE VEGETATIVE ORGANS.      The shoots and roots of grasses conform in their internal structure to  the monocotyledonous type. In all grasses numerous threads are found  running longitudinally within the stem and some of these pass into the  leaves, at the nodes, and run as nerves in the blades of the leaves.  These threads are the vascular bundles. The rest of the tissue of the  stem and leaves consists of thin-walled parenchymatous cells of  different sorts.    The general structure of these bundles is more or less the same in all  grasses. A vascular bundle consists of only xylem and phloem, without  the cambium, and so no secondary thickening can take place in the stems  of grasses. Such bundles as these are called =closed vascular bundles=  to distinguish them from the dicotyledonous type of vascular bundles  which are called =open vascular bundles= on account of the existence of  the cambium.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.--Transverse section of a vascular bundle. x 250    1. Annular vessel; 2. spiral vessel; 3. pitted vessel; 4. phloem or  sieve tubes; 5. sclerenchyma.]    The component parts and elements of which the vascular bundles in  grasses are composed may be learnt by studying the transverse and  longitudinal sections of these bundles in any grass. The cross and  longitudinal sections of a vascular bundle of the stem of _Pennisetum  cenchroides_, are shown in figs. 22 and 23. In the figure of the  transverse section the two large cavities indicated by the number 3 and  the two small circular cavities with thick walls lying between the  larger ones and indicated by the numbers 1 and 2 are the chief elements  of the xylem.    By looking at the longitudinal section it is obvious that these elements  are really vessels, the larger being pitted and the smaller annular and  spiral vessels. These vessels together with the numerous small  thick-walled cells lying between the pitted vessels constitute the  xylem. Just above the xylem there is a group of large and small  thin-walled cells. This is the phloem and it consists of sieve tubes and  thin-walled cells. All round the xylem and the phloem there are many  thick-walled cells. These are really fibres forming the =bundle-sheath=.  On account of this bundle-sheath the bundles are called =fibro-vascular  bundles=.    [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Longitudinal section of a vascular bundle. x  250    1. Annular vessel; 2. spiral vessel; 3. pitted vessel; 4. sieve tubes or  phloem; 5. sclerenchyma.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Rottboellia exaltata. x 70    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    =Structure of the stem.=--The stem of a grass consists of a mass of  parenchymatous cells with a number of fibro-vascular bundles imbedded in  it, and it is covered externally by a protective layer of cells, the  epidermis. The stem is usually solid in all grasses in the young stage,  but as it matures the internodes become hollow in many grasses and they  remain solid in a few. In the internodes the fibro-vascular bundles run  longitudinally and are parallel, but in the nodes they run in all  directions and form a net work from which emerge a few bundles to enter  the leaves. So far as the broad general features are concerned, the  stems of many grasses are more or less similar in structure. However,  when we take into consideration the arrangement of bundles, the  development and arrangement of sclerenchyma, every species of grass has  its own special characteristics. And these are so striking and constant  that it may be possible to identify the species from these characters  alone.    We may take as a type the stem of _Rottboellia exaltata_. This stem is  somewhat semi-circular in transverse section and it is almost straight  and flat in the front (the side towards the axillary bud). The  peripheral portion of the stem becomes somewhat rigid and thick due to  the aggregation of vascular bundles, some small and others large. The  outermost series of bundles consisting of small and larger bundles are  in contact with the layers of the cells lying just beneath the epidermis  and these cells are also thick-walled. A few are away from these being  separated by three or four layers of cells from the peripheral bundles.  In all these vascular bundles the bundle-sheath is very strongly  developed all round and is very much developed especially at the sides.  It is this great development of sclerenchyma that makes the outer  portion of the cortex hard. Within the ground tissue are found a number  of vascular bundles scattered more or less uniformly. These bundles have  no continuous bundle-sheaths but have instead groups of fibres at the  sides and in front of the phloem. The cavities near the annular vessels  are somewhat larger and conspicuous in these bundles.    [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Transverse section of the stem of Pennisetum  cenchroides. x 20]    The epidermal cells are all thickened very much and the outer layer is  cutinized and impregnated with silica. This is the case in the epidermis  of the stems and leaves of most grasses. (See fig. 24.)    In order to give a general idea of the variations in the structure of  the stem in grasses a few examples are chosen and the details of the  structure of the stems of these grasses are dealt with here.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Pennisetum cenchroides. x 70    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    The stem of _Pennisetum cenchroides_ is somewhat round in outline in the  transverse section with a slight curvature in the front. The vascular  bundles are rather numerous and irregularly scattered all over the  ground tissue. The peripheral bundles are not so close to the periphery  of the stem as in _Rottboellia exaltata_. These are separated from the  epidermis by several layers of parenchymatous cells. Further, these  peripheral bundles are all imbedded in a continuous sclerenchymatous  band which runs round the stem in the form of a ring. The epidermal  cells as well as the layer of cells in immediate contact with it are  thick-walled. In the vascular bundles of the ground tissue the  bundle-sheath is rather prominent and the phloem portion is well  developed. (See figs. 25 and 26.)    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Transverse section of the stem of Eriochloa  polystachya. x 25]    In the stem of _Eriochloa polystachya_, all the vascular bundles are  more or less peripheral in position leaving a wide area of  parenchymatous cells in the centre. The outline of the stem in cross  section is rotund or ovate-rotund with the front side somewhat flattened  and straight. The epidermal cells alone are thickened. A well developed  continuous ring of sclerenchyma is present and this is connected with  the epidermal layer at short intervals by means of short  sclerenchymatous bands. So the parenchymatous cells of the cortex lying  outside the sclerenchymatous ring are divided into small isolated areas.  There are three series of vascular bundles.    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Eriochloa polystachya. x 70    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    One series consists of small bundles lying inside the sclerenchyma ring  at the base of each of the connecting bands. The second series is made  up of large vascular bundles imbedded in the ring so as to bulge out  inside the ring. The vascular bundles of the third series are found just  away from the ring and separated from it by a few layers of  parenchymatous cells. (See figs. 27 and 28.)    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Transverse section of the stem of Setaria  glauca. x 15]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of  Setaria glauca. x 50    1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]    Another stem in which the vascular bundles are more or less peripheral  in position and enclosing a wide parenchyma is that of _Setaria glauca_.  In the transverse section of the stem the outline is ovate, laterally  compressed, obtusely keeled at the back and somewhat concave in the  front. The sclerenchymatous band is narrow and continuous and very close  to the epidermis, being separated from it only by two or three layers of  thin-walled cells. The epidermal cells alone are thickened. As to the  vascular bundles there are three sets. One set of bundles lying just  outside the sclerenchymatous ring consists of small ones connecting the  ring with the epidermis. Just inside the sclerenchymatous ring lies a  series of bundles which are connected with it. Still inside, at some  distance from the sclerenchymatous "]]]
