I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two--      The woman that kissed him and--pinched his poke--was the lady that's            known as Lou.          THE CREMATION OF SAM MCGEE          _There are strange things done in the midnight sun        By the men who moil for gold;      The Arctic trails have their secret tales        That would make your blood run cold;      The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,        But the queerest they ever did see      Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge        I cremated Sam McGee._        Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.      Why he left his home in the South to roam round the Pole God only            knows.      He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a            spell;      Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd \"sooner live in            hell.\"        On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.      Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven            nail.      If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze, till sometimes we            couldn't see;      It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.        And that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the            snow,      And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and            toe,      He turned to me, and, \"Cap,\" says he, \"I'll cash in this trip, I guess;      And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.\"        Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no: then he says with a            sort of moan:      \"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled            clean through to the bone.      Yet 'taint being dead, it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains:      So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last            remains.\"        A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;      And we started on at the streak of dawn, but God! he looked ghastly            pale.      He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in            Tennessee;      And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.        There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror            driven,      With a corpse half-hid that I couldn't get rid because of a promise            given;      It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: \"You may tax your            brawn and brains,      But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last            remains.\"        Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern            code.      In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I            cursed that load.      In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies,            round in a ring,      Howled out their woes to the homeless snows--O God! how I loathed            the thing!        And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;      And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;      The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give            in;      And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.        Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;      It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the            \"Alice May.\"      And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen            chum:      Then, \"Here,\" said I, with a sudden cry, \"is my cre-ma-tor-eum.\"        Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;      Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;      The flames just soared, and the furnace roared--such a blaze you            seldom see;      And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.        Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;      And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began            to blow.      It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I            don't know why;      And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.        I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;      But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;      I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: \"I'll just take a peep            inside.      I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked,\" ... then the door I            opened wide.        And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the            furnace roar;      And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: \"Please close            that door.      It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and            storm--      Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've            been warm.\"        _There are strange things done in the midnight sun        By the men who moil for gold;      The Arctic trails have their secret tales        That would make your blood run cold;      The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,        But the queerest they ever did see      Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge        I cremated Sam McGee._          MY MADONNA          I haled me a woman from the street,        Shameless, but, oh, so fair!      I bade her sit in the model's seat,        And I painted her sitting there.            I hid all trace of her heart unclean;            I painted a babe at her breast;          I painted her as she might have been            If the Worst had been the Best.        She laughed at my picture, and went away.        Then came, with a knowing nod,      A connoisseur, and I heard him say:        \"'Tis Mary, the Mother of God.\"            So I painted a halo round her hair,            And I sold her, and took my fee,          And she hangs in the church of Saint Hilaire,            Where you and all may see.          UNFORGOTTEN          I know a garden where the lilies gleam,        And one who lingers in the sunshine there;        She is than white-stoled lily far more fair,      And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream.            I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,            And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,            Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary--then          He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.        And ah, it's strange, for desolate and dim        Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;        Yet he is in the garden by her side,      And she is in the garret there with him.          THE RECKONING          It's fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant,      With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want;      To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass,      Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass;      It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,      But it's quite another matter when you                                                    Pay the bill.        It's great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent,      To wear your glad rags always, and to never save a cent;      To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip;      To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip;      To know you're acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still,      Till Nature calls a show-down, and you                                                    Pay the bill.        Time has got a little bill--get wise while yet you may,      For the debit side's increasing in a most alarming way;      The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done,      They're all put down: it's up to you to pay for every one.      So eat, drink, and be merry, have a good time if you will,      But God help you when the time comes, and you                                                    Foot the bill.          QUATRAINS          One said: Thy life is thine to make or mar,      To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;      It lies with thee--the choice is thine, is thine,      To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.        I answer Her: The choice is mine--ah, no!      We all were made or marred long, long ago.      The parts are written: hear the super wail:      \"Who is stage-managing this cosmic show?\"        Blind fools of fate, and slaves of circumstance,      Life is a fiddler, and we all must dance.      From gloom where mocks that will-o'-wisp, Freewill,      I heard a voice cry: \"Say, give us a chance.\"        Chance! Oh, there is no chance. The scene is set.      Up with the curtain! Man, the marionette,      Resumes his part. The gods will work the wires.      They've got it all down fine, you bet, you bet!        It's all decreed: the mighty earthquake crash;      The countless constellations' wheel and flash;      The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide,      The composition of your dinner hash.        There's no haphazard in this world of ours:      Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.      They rule the world. (A king was shot last night.      Last night I held the joker and both bowers.)        From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust.      We can't do what we would, but what we must.      Heredity has got us in a cinch.      (Consoling thought, when you've been on a \"bust.\")        Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:      \"There's no beginning, never will be end.\"      It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!      The table's spread; come, let us dine, my friend.          THE MEN THAT DON'T FIT IN          There's a race of men that don't fit in,        A race that can't stay still;      So they break the hearts of kith and kin,        And they roam the world at will.

Now he had given them names, names which had come out of the welter of  dreams which shadowed his stumbling journey across this weird country.    Nalik'ideyu (Maiden-Who-Walks-Ridges) was the female who continued to  shepherd him along, never venturing too far from his side. Naginlta  (He-Who-Scouts-Ahead) was the male who did just that, disappearing at  long intervals and then returning to face the man and his mate as if  conveying some report necessary to their journey.    It was Nalik'ideyu who sought out Travis now, her red tongue lolling  from her mouth as she panted. Not from exertion, he was certain of that.  No, she was excited and eager ... on the hunt! That was it--a hunt!    Travis' own tongue ran across his lips as an impression hit him with  feral force. There was meat--rich, fresh--just ahead. Meat that lived,  waiting to be killed. Inside him his own avid hunger roused, shaking him  farther out of the crusting dream.    His hands went to his waist, but the groping fingers did not find what  vague memory told him should be there--a belt, heavy with knife in  sheath.    He examined his own body with attention to find he was adequately  covered by breeches of a smooth, dull brown material which blended well  with the vegetation about him. He wore a loose shirt, belted in at the  narrow waist by a folded strip of cloth, the ends of which fluttered  free. On his feet were tall moccasins, the leg pieces extending some  distance up his calves, the toes turned up in rounded points.    Some of this he found familiar, but these were fragments of memory;  again his mind fitted one picture above another. One thing he did know  for sure--he had no weapons. And that realization struck home with a  thrust of real and terrible fear which tore away more of the  bewilderment cloaking his mind.    Nalik'ideyu was impatient. Having advanced a step or two, she now looked  back at him over her shoulder, yellow eyes slitted, her demand on him as  instant and real as if she had voiced understandable words. Meat was  waiting, and she was hungry. Also she expected Travis to aid in the  hunt--at once.    Though he could not match her fluid grace in moving through the grass,  Travis followed her, keeping to cover. He shook his head vigorously, in  spite of the stab of pain the motion cost him, and paid more attention  to his surroundings. It was apparent that the earth under him, the grass  around, the valley of the golden haze, were all real, not part of a  dream. Therefore that other countryside which he kept seeing in a  ghostly fashion was a hallucination.    Even the air which he drew into his lungs and expelled again, had a  strange smell, or was it taste? He could not be sure which. He knew that  hypno-training could produce queer side effects, but ... this....    Travis paused, staring unseeingly before him at the grass still waving  from the coyote's passage. Hypno-training! What was that? Now three  pictures fought to focus in his mind: the two landscapes which did not  match and a shadowy third. He shook his head again, his hands to his  temples. This--this only was real: the ground, the grass, the valley,  the hunger in him, the hunt waiting....    He forced himself to concentrate on the immediate present and the  portion of world he could see, feel, scent, which lay here and now about  him.    The grass grew shorter as he proceeded in Nalik'ideyu's wake. But the  haze was not thinning. It seemed to hang in patches, and when he  ventured through the edge of a patch it was like creeping through a fog  of golden, dancing motes with here and there a glittering speck whirling  and darting like a living thing. Masked by the stuff, Travis reached a  line of brush and sniffed.    It was a warm scent, a heavy odor he could not identify and yet one he  associated with a living creature. Flat to earth, he pushed head and  shoulders under the low limbs of the bush to look ahead.    Here was a space where the fog did not hold, a pocket of earth clear  under the morning sun. And grazing there were three animals. Again shock  cleared a portion of Travis' bemused brain.    They were about the size, he thought, of antelopes, and they had a  general resemblance to those beasts in that they had four slender legs,  a rounded body, and a head. But they had alien features, so alien as to  hold him in open-mouthed amazement.    The bodies had bare spots here and there, and patches of creamy--fur? Or  was it hair which hung in strips, as if the creatures had been partially  plucked in a careless fashion? The necks were long and moved about in a  serpentine motion, as though their spines were as limber as reptiles'.  On the end of those long and twisting necks were heads which also  appeared more suitable to another species--broad, rather flat, with a  singular toadlike look--but furnished with horns set halfway down the  nose, horns which began in a single root and then branched into two  sharp points.    They were unearthly! Again Travis blinked, brought his hand up to his  head as he continued to view the browsers. There were three of them: two  larger and with horns, the other a smaller beast with less of the ragged  fur and only the beginning button of a protuberance on the nose; it was  probably a calf.    One of those mental alerts from the coyotes broke his absorption.  Nalik'ideyu was not interested in the odd appearance of the grazing  creatures; she was intent upon their usefulness in another way--as a  full and satisfying meal--and she was again impatient with him for his  dull response.    His examination took a more practical turn. An antelope's defense was  speed, though it could be tricked into hunting range through its  inordinate curiosity. The slender legs of these beasts suggested a like  degree of speed, and Travis had no weapons at all.    Those nose horns had an ugly look; this thing might be a fighter rather  than a runner. But the suggestion which had flashed from coyote to him  had taken root. Travis was hungry, he was a hunter, and here was meat on  the hoof, queer as it looked.    Again he received a message. Naginlta was on the opposite side of the  clearing. If the creatures depended on speed, then Travis believed they  could probably outrun not only him but the coyotes as well--which left  cunning and some sort of plan.    Travis glanced at the cover where he knew Nalik'ideyu crouched and from  which had come that flash of agreement. He shivered. These were truly no  animals, but _ga-n_, _ga-n_ of power! And as _ga-n_ he must treat them,  accede to their will. Spurred by that, the Apache gave only flicks of  attention to the browsers while at the same time he studied the part of  the landscape uncovered by mist.    Without weapons or speed, they must conceive a trap. Again Travis sensed  that agreement which was _ga-n_ magic, and with it the strong impression  urging him to the right. He was making progress with skill he did not  even recognize and which he had never been conscious of learning.    The bushes and small, droop-limbed trees, their branches not clothed  with leaves from proper twigs but with a reddish bristly growth  protruding directly from their surfaces, made a partial wall for the  pocket-sized meadow. That screen reached a rocky cleft where the mist  curled in a long tongue through a wall twice Travis' height. If the  browsers could be maneuvered into taking the path through that cleft....    Travis searched about him, and his hands closed upon the oldest weapon  of his species, a stone pulled from an earth pocket and balanced neatly  in the palm of his hand. It was a long chance but his best one.    The Apache took the first step on a new and fearsome road. These _ga-n_  had put their thoughts--or their desires--into his mind. Could he so  contact them in return?    With the stone clenched in his fist, his shoulders back against the wall  not too far from the cleft opening, Travis strove to think out, clearly  and simply, this poor plan of his. He did not know that he was reacting  the way scientists deep space away had hoped he might. Nor did Travis  guess that at this point he had already traveled far beyond the  expectations of the men who had bred and trained the two mutant coyotes.  He only believed that this might be the one way he could obey the wishes  of the two spirits he thought far more powerful than any man. So he  pictured in his mind the cleft, the running creatures, and the part the  _ga-n_ could play if they so willed.    Assent--in its way as loud and clear as if shouted. The man fingered the  stone, weighed it. There would probably be just one moment when he could  use it to effect, and he must be ready.    From this point he could no longer see the small meadow where the  grazers were. But Travis knew, as well as if he watched the scene, that  the coyotes were creeping in, belly flat to earth, adding a feline  stealth and patience to their own cunning.    There! Travis' head jerked, the alert had come, the drive was beginning.  He tensed, gripping his stone.    A yapping bark was answered by a sound he could not describe, a noise  which was neither cough nor grunt but a combination of both. Again a  yap-yap....    A toad-head burst through the screen of brush, the double horn on its  nose festooned with a length of grass torn up by the roots. Wide  eyes--milky and seeming to be without pupils--fastened on Travis, but he  could not be sure the thing saw him, for it kept on, picking up speed  as it approached the cleft. Behind it ran the calf, and that guttural  cry was bubbling from its broad flat lips.    The long neck of the adult writhed, the frog-head swung closer to the  ground so that the twin points of the horn"]]]
