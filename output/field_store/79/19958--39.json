[7] Cardwell, _Synod_., p. 420; Strype, _Cranmer_, vol. i. p. 155. The  petition of the clergy expressly says that this had been done _ex mandato  convocationis_. Cranmer's notes on the proceedings, given in Cardwell,  make them say that \"by the commandment of King Henry VIII. certain  prelates and other learned men were appointed to alter the service in the  Church.\" It is probably an instance of two ways of regarding the same  thing, and is not uninstructive.    [8] I venture on this suggestion as to the character of the much discussed  \"Windsor Commission,\" but it is beside my subject to debate the  point. It seems to reconcile the many assertions that the Prayer-book  was prepared by authority of Convocation with other assertions that all  was done by a committee appointed by the Crown. See the preceding  note. The statements are collected in Gasquet and Bishop, pp. 148-156.    [9] See Gasquet and Bishop, p. 178, and the notes of the debate on the  Sacrament printed by them from MS. Reg. 17 B. xxxix., in their Appendix  v. pp. 403, 404.    [10] The _Interim_ of 1548 was an attempt of Charles V. and the Diet of  Augsburg to grapple with this state of things, and was so far analogous  to the English Act of Uniformity, and a precedent for it.    [11] See the letters of Micronius and Utenhovius to Bullinger, _Orig.  Lett_, pp. 568, 570, 587. The patent for the incorporation and protection  of the congregation is given in French by Collier, _Records_, vol. ii.  no. lxv. The date is July 24, 1550, and a _non obstante_ clause bars any  interference \"par aucun statute, acte, ordonance, provision, ou restriction,  faits publietz, ordonnez, ou pourveus au contraire.\"    [12] I Mariae, sess. 2, cap. 2.

Jewel wrote to Peter Martyr on April 14: \"Itaque factum est  ut multis iam in locis missae etiam invitis edictis sua sponte ceciderint.\"  _Zurich Letters_, ep. vi.    [14] Venetian State Papers, vol. vii. p. 57. Easter Day fell on March 26  that year. The particulars reported by _il Schifanoya_ are interesting. On  the morrow of St. George's Day, he reports again, mass for the dead was  said for the chapter of the Garter in the usual manner, but the Epistle and  Gospel were said in English. _Ibid_., p. 74.

[18] So all authors; I can find no evidence of the date.    [19] Nor was it so annexed in fact. Cardwell is here in error (_Conferences_,  p. 30), and his mistake has been generally followed. If there were any  doubt on the subject, it would be dispelled by the fact that in 1661 the  House of Commons sought the Book annexed to the Act, not of 1559, but  of 1552. See below, p. 21.    [20] See the Bishop of Chester's speech against the Bill, in Cardwell,  _Conferences_, p. 116: \"Marke, my lordes, this short discourse, I beseech  your lordshippes, and yee shall perceave, that all catholike princes, heryticke  princes, yea, and infidells, have from tyme to tyme refused to take that  upon them, that your lordshippes go about and chalenge to do.\" Collier,  vol. ii. p. 430, conjectures that the rubric about kneeling at Communion  was omitted by the committee of revisers, and restored while the Bill was  passing through Parliament; but there is no evidence on either point.  The letter of Guest, to which he refers, probably belongs to an early  stage of the revision, and contemplates other and more striking variations  from the Book as finally revised. See especially the paragraphs in  Cardwell, _Conferences_, p. 51.    [21] See Clay, _Liturgies, etc., of Queen Elizabeth_, pp. xii. seqq.

The Address of the Ministers, the  King's Declaration of October 25, and the Letters Patent of March 25,  are given by Cardwell in full, pp. 277-302.    [25] Cardwell, _Synod_., pp. 640-642.

It was probably intended to  mark in it the alterations mentioned in the Act of 1559. The actual Book  was missing, and apparently no copy of the Prayer-book of that year could  readily be procured. A copy of the year 1604 was probably selected as  being anterior to the changes made by James I. after the Hampton Court  Conference, and so presumably printed in accordance with the Act of  1559. It did not, however, as I have said above, strictly follow the Act.  Two prayers printed \"before the reading Psalms\" were cancelled before  the book was annexed to the Bill, but the other variations would probably  be unknown to the examiners.

[40] See Appendix.    [41] This fact should suffice to dispose of a theory propounded by some  who attempt to save the face of the Church by representing the Act of  Uniformity as the _ratification_ in Parliament of what had been already  done by the Church. There is no historical basis for such a theory.    [42] _The Book of Common Prayer, etc., with notes, etc_., by A. J. Stephens,  p. clxxiv.

The smallest formations present the same regular irregularities of form.  Crystals approach the nearest to mathematical figures, but they break  with compound irregular fractures at their bases of attachment. Nature  gives no perfect mathematical figures; they only approximate  mathematical perfection. Infidels do not trouble themselves with science  on this account. \"The utter absence of any regularity or assimilation to  the spheroidal figure, either in meridianal, equatorial or parallel  lines, mountain ranges, sea beaches or courses of rivers, is fatal to  mathematical accuracy in the more extended measurements. It is only by  taking the mean of a great many measurements that an approximate  accuracy can be obtained. Where this is not possible, as in the  measurement of high mountains, the truth remains undetermined by  hundreds of feet; or as in the case of the earth's spheroidal axis,  Bessel's measurement differs from Newton's by fully eleven miles.\" See  Humboldt's Cosmos, vol. 1, p. 7, 156. \"The smaller measures are  proportionally inaccurate.\" All these irregularities and imperfections  in science are overlooked, considered not in the least objections to the  use of language which would, upon the most rigid application, cut them  out as fables on the one hand or destroy science upon the other; but no  sensible man thinks of either as a matter allowable.    On the other side, Infidels are \"eternally\" mouthing about  irregularities in the lives of the ancient men of the Bible, which are  exceptions to the general rule, just as though religious persons could  live lives of absolute perfection. The language, also, of the Bible,  which, like the language of science, takes no notice of irregularities  that must be expected in the lives of the very best men upon the earth,  is by them abused. For instance, \"Be perfect as your Father in heaven is  perfect,\" is construed to mean that God is a man God, clothed with human  imperfections, or, otherwise, man is imperatively required to be  absolutely perfect. All such abuse of language is contemptible. Many  other examples might be adduced--such as the irregularities in the words  employed by the witnesses of the resurrection of Christ, which do not  affect the evidence of the fact to be established in the least degree,  and which are just such irregularities as are witnessed in evidence  given in court rooms almost daily, and passed without so much as being  noticed. For example, one witness says Mary Magdalene \"came very early  to the sepulchre,\" and another says she came \"about sunrise.\" If all  Christians were to treat the literature of science, and science itself,  as these would-be wise Infidels treat the literature of religion, and  religion itself, it would be surprising to run over the absurdities as  well as irregularities of scientific history. There are irregularities  in nature, and their name is legion; they all belong to that wonderfully  boasted harmony of nature so much talked of in our day. As for the  mistakes made in religion since the days of the apostles of the Christ,  they are many; but what have they to do with the _genuine_?    How many mistakes have scientists made in the same period of time? I  shall not try to ape the infidel, but I must be permitted to call  attention to a few of the many scientific blunders.    Perhaps the greatest blunder of the present day, upon the part of  scientists, is their attempt to bring into disrepute the cosmogony  given in the Bible by a scientific cosmogony, which leaves off as  \"unknown\" the only active world-forming force. They arrogantly assume to  be acquainted with the entire history of our planet from the atoms to  the globe. Yet they acknowledge that the \"force which was and is in  operation was and is unknown; that unknown force had its influence in  framing the world,\" and its omission is always fatal to the theory which  knows nothing about it or neglects it. There are laws also far-reaching,  whose omission must be equally fatal.    Infidels, being sensible of this truth, have endeavored to simplify  matters to the level of our ignorance, by reducing all primordial  elements to one, or at most two, simple elements, and all forces to the  form of one universal and irrational law; but the progress of science  utterly blasts the effort. No scientific man now dreams of one  primordial element. Chemistry reveals a great many different elements,  which can not be reduced or changed from their simple forms, much less  identified as one and the self-same \"substance.\" The idea of \"one  substance\" _only_ is a very great error, which grew out of an abuse of  language in confounding the two words, matter and substance. The latter  word is equally applicable to _matter_, or _spirit_, but the former  always contrasts with spirit; so to confound the two is to ignore a  distinction upon which everything depends in any, except the  materialistic, philosophy. When the term substance is used in the  currency of the term matter it admits of the plural form as well as the  singular. Indeed, all the primordial elements known in chemistry are  known as so many different substances. It is unscientific and absurd to  confound all these elements by claiming the one-substance theory. It has  been called \"the hog philosophy,\" on account of its swallowing down so  many _different_ substances in the single form of the word.    \"Eighty theories, hostile to Christianity, developed in the course of  forty or fifty years, were brought before the Institute of France in  1806, all of which are repudiated\"--dead. It is useless to go further  into details. Science has been as much abused as religion. What benefit  would accrue to the human family from an effort upon our part to bring  to the foreground all the blunders made in scientific researches which  are to-day numbered with the old effete errors in religion? And where is  the propriety of infidels making a set of asses of themselves by playing  upon the little irregularities of language and character in religion, as  they _themselves_ allow no man to do in science and morality.    \"EQUAL HANDED JUSTICE\" TO ALL, IS OUR MOTTO.          GEOLOGY IN ITS STRUGGLES AND GROWTH AS A SCIENCE.      The science of Geology in its early history is like all other sciences,  an infant. It was not a Hercules at its birth. On the contrary, it was  childlike and rather crooked in many of its ways; but chastisement and  criticism have brought it very far toward real manhood. Its early nurses  were standing continually on the dark line separating the comprehensible  from the incomprehensible, without any guides. They were out upon an  unexplored sea in the mere twilight of the morning. They were opposed at  every step by the combative tendencies of human nature, which are ever  seeking too much for their own gratification to admit any strange,  startling propositions as intruders among old and long cherished ideas.  In its history it appears before us, first as an enemy to religion, and  then as an unobjectionable science, a neutral. But since the publication  of \"The Footprints of the Creator,\" by the lamented Hugh Miller, it  appears in front as a fast friend and abettor. And now, since it has  approached so near to its manhood, we do not see how we did without its  aid so long. Its first grand position touching the immense masses of the  rock formations as results of second causes, in operation away back  yonder before organic life appeared upon our planet, was looked upon by  intelligent Biblical scholars of those times with suspicion, as a  system at variance with the records of the Bible. This, along with  difference of sentiment among its friends, has been the means of a very  rapid growth towards perfection. Curiosity was aroused and observations  multiplied, errors corrected and the untenable removed, until the  science now stands before us with its bases settled in unquestionable  facts. Let us all learn from this circumstance the bearings of the times  in which we live, for a double process of elimination is now going on  under the providence of God, by means of which both Christianity and  science will have more beauty and strength of manhood to command the  respect of our children.    Geology is exercising a wonderful influence on the side of religion in  the minds of those who are acquainted with its facts. In the hands of  Miller it gives a very decisive answer against the evolution hypothesis,  which is by no means a new speculation. It was, in its general form, a  very prominent doctrine of the Epicurean philosophy. \"The author of the  'Vestiges,' with Professor Oken, regarded the experiment of the  formation of cells in albumen by electric currents as the leading fact  of the system.\" They claimed that currents of electricity in the earth's  surface generated and vitalized the cells, and that all organic life  thus originated. There is nothing to save this speculation, when it is  undressed, from contempt. \"The only patronage it ever received grew out  of the fact that there is a species of superstition which causes people  to take upon credit whatever assumes the name of science, and is opposed  to the old superstition of faith in witches and ghosts.\" With this  speculation before us, seemingly plausible, yet false, being fraught  with error, we are reminded of the fact that it has been eagerly  embraced by many who seem to think that it has a firm foundation in the  science of Geology, which they regard as presenting the order in which  created beings appeared. The author of the \"Vestiges\" claims that the  first step in the creation of life upon our earth was a  _chemico-electric_ operation, forming simple germinal vesicles. Page  155.    This is an item wholly unknown in the geological record and lies before  the beginning of any kind of similitude alluded to in this article. \"The  idea which I form of"]]]
