But what I can't make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes,  is how on earth YOU got yourself mixed up in the matter.\"    \"Education, Gregson, education.  Still seeking knowledge at the old  university.  Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and  grotesque to add to your collection.  By the way, it is not eight  o'clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden!

All the long November  evening I waited, filled with impatience for his return.  At last,  shortly after nine o'clock, there arrived a messenger with a note:    Am dining at Goldini's Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please  come at once and join me there.  Bring with you a jemmy, a dark  lantern, a chisel, and a revolver.    S.H.    It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the  dim, fog-draped streets.  I stowed them all discreetly away in my  overcoat and drove straight to the address given.  There sat my friend  at a little round table near the door of the garish Italian restaurant.    \"Have you had something to eat?  Then join me in a coffee and curacao.  Try one of the proprietor's cigars.  They are less poisonous than one  would expect.  Have you the tools?\"    \"They are here, in my overcoat.\"    \"Excellent.  Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with  some indication of what we are about to do.  Now it must be evident to  you, Watson, that this young man's body was PLACED on the roof of the  train.  That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact that  it was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had fallen.\"    \"Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?\"    \"I should say it was impossible.  If you examine the roofs you will  find that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing round  them.  Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan West was  placed on it.\"    \"How could he be placed there?\"    \"That was the question which we had to answer.  There is only one  possible way.  You are aware that the Underground runs clear of tunnels  at some points in the West End.  I had a vague memory that as I have  travelled by it I have occasionally seen windows just above my head.  Now, suppose that a train halted under such a window, would there be  any difficulty in laying a body upon the roof?\"    \"It seems most improbable.\"    \"We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingencies  fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.  Here  all other contingencies HAVE failed.  When I found that the leading  international agent, who had just left London, lived in a row of houses  which abutted upon the Underground, I was so pleased that you were a  little astonished at my sudden frivolity.\"    \"Oh, that was it, was it?\"    \"Yes, that was it.  Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield Gardens, had  become my objective.  I began my operations at Gloucester Road Station,  where a very helpful official walked with me along the track and  allowed me to satisfy myself not only that the back-stair windows of  Caulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential fact  that, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways, the  Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some minutes at  that very spot.\"    \"Splendid, Holmes!  You have got it!\"    \"So far--so far, Watson.  We advance, but the goal is afar. Well,  having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and  satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown.  It is a considerable  house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms.  Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a  confederate entirely in his confidence.  We must bear in mind that  Oberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of his booty, but not  with any idea of flight; for he had no reason to fear a warrant, and  the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit would certainly never occur to  him.  Yet that is precisely what we are about to make.\"    \"Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?\"    \"Hardly on the evidence.\"    \"What can we hope to do?\"    \"We cannot tell what correspondence may be there.\"    \"I don't like it, Holmes.\"    \"My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street.  I'll do the  criminal part.  It's not a time to stick at trifles.  Think of  Mycroft's note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who  waits for news.  We are bound to go.\"    My answer was to rise from the table.    \"You are right, Holmes.  We are bound to go.\"    He sprang up and shook me by the hand.    \"I knew you would not shrink at the last,\" said he, and for a moment I  saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had  ever seen.  The next instant he was his masterful, practical self once  more.    \"It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry.  Let us walk,\" said  he.  \"Don't drop the instruments, I beg.  Your arrest as a suspicious  character would be a most unfortunate complication.\"    Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and  porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle  Victorian epoch in the West End of London.  Next door there appeared to  be a children's party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the  clatter of a piano resounded through the night.  The fog still hung  about and screened us with its friendly shade.  Holmes had lit his  lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.    \"This is a serious proposition,\" said he.  \"It is certainly bolted as  well as locked.  We would do better in the area.  There is an excellent  archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.  Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you.\"    A minute later we were both in the area.  Hardly had we reached the  dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog  above.  As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the lower  door.  I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it flew  open.  We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area door  behind us.  Holmes led the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair.  His  little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.    \"Here we are, Watson--this must be the one.\"  He threw it open, and as  he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud  roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his light  along the window-sill.  It was thickly coated with soot from the  passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in places.    \"You can see where they rested the body.  Halloa, Watson! what is this?  There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark.\"  He was pointing to  faint discolourations along the woodwork of the window.  \"Here it is on  the stone of the stair also.  The demonstration is complete.  Let us  stay here until a train stops.\"    We had not long to wait.  The very next train roared from the tunnel as  before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of brakes,  pulled up immediately beneath us.  It was not four feet from the  window-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed the  window.    \"So far we are justified,\" said he.  \"What do you think of it, Watson?\"    \"A masterpiece.  You have never risen to a greater height.\"    \"I cannot agree with you there.  From the moment that I conceived the  idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very  abstruse one, all the rest was inevitable.  If it were not for the  grave interests involved the affair up to this point would be  insignificant.  Our difficulties are still before us. But perhaps we  may find something here which may help us.\"    We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of rooms upon  the first floor.  One was a dining-room, severely furnished and  containing nothing of interest.  A second was a bedroom, which also  drew blank.  The remaining room appeared more promising, and my  companion settled down to a systematic examination.  It was littered  with books and papers, and was evidently used as a study.  Swiftly and  methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer and  cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his  austere face.  At the end of an hour he was no further than when he  started.    \"The cunning dog has covered his tracks,\" said he.  \"He has left  nothing to incriminate him.  His dangerous correspondence has been  destroyed or removed.  This is our last chance.\"    It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-desk. Holmes  pried it open with his chisel.  Several rolls of paper were within,  covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to what  they referred.  The recurring words, \"water pressure\" and \"pressure to  the square inch\" suggested some possible relation to a submarine.  Holmes tossed them all impatiently aside.  There only remained an  envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it.  He shook them out  on the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had  been raised.    \"What's this, Watson?  Eh?  What's this?  Record of a series of  messages in the advertisements of a paper.  Daily Telegraph agony  column by the print and paper.  Right-hand top corner of a page. No  dates--but messages arrange themselves.  This must be the first:    \"Hoped to hear sooner.  Terms agreed to.  Write fully to address given  on card.    \"Pierrot.    \"Next comes:    \"Too complex for description.  Must have full report, Stuff awaits you  when goods delivered.    \"Pierrot.    \"Then comes:    \"Matter presses.  Must withdraw offer unless contract completed. Make  appointment by letter. Will confirm by advertisement.    \"Pierrot.    \"Finally:    \"Monday night after nine.  Two taps.  Only ourselves.  Do not be so  suspicious.  Payment in hard cash when goods delivered.    \"Pierrot.    \"A fairly complete record, Watson!  If we could only get at the man at  the other end!\"  He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the  table.  Finally he sprang to his feet.    \"Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all.  There is nothing  more to "]]]
