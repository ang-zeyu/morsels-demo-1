[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2756"],[0,"Marquise Brinvillier (#5)"],[1,"that for seven years he was in the  service of the deceased; that he had given into his charge, two years  earlier, 100 pistoles and 200 white crowns, which should be found in a  cloth bag under the closet window, and in the same a paper stating that  the said sum belonged to him, together with the transfer of 300 livres  owed to him by the late M. d'Aubray, councillor; the said transfer made  by him at Laserre, together with three receipts from his master of  apprenticeship, 100 livres each: these moneys and papers he claims.\"    To Lachaussee the reply was given that he must wait till the day when  the seals were broken, and then if all was as he said, his property  would be returned.    But Lachaussee was not the only person who was agitated about the death  of Sainte-Croix. The, marquise, who was familiar with all the secrets of  this fatal closet, had hurried to the commissary as 2496 soon as she  heard of the event, and although it was ten o'clock at night had  demanded to speak with him. But he had replied by his head clerk, Pierre  Frater, that he was in bed; the marquise insisted, begging them to rouse  him up, for she wanted a box that she could not allow to have opened.  The clerk then went up to the Sieur Picard's bedroom, but came back  saying that what the marquise demanded was for the time being an  impossibility, for the commissary was asleep. She saw that it was idle  to insist, and went away, saying that she should send a man the next  morning to fetch the box. In the morning the man came, offering fifty  Louis to the commissary on behalf of the marquise, if he would give her  the box. But he replied that the box was in the sealed room, that it  would have to be opened, and that if the objects claimed by the marquise  were really hers, they would be safely handed over to her. This reply  struck the marquise like a thunderbolt. There was no time to be lost:  hastily she removed from the rue Neuve-Saint-Paul, where her town house  was, to Picpus, her country place. Thence she posted the same evening to  Liege, arriving the next morning, and retired to a convent.    The seals had been set on the 31st of July 1672, and they were taken off  on the 8th of August following. Just as they set to work a lawyer  charged with full powers of acting for the marquise, appeared and put in  the following statement: \"Alexandre Delamarre, lawyer acting for the  Marquise de Brinvilliers, has come forward, and declares that if in the  box claimed by his client there is found a promise signed by her for the  sum of 30,000 livres, it is a paper taken from her by fraud, against  which, in case of her signature being verified, she intends to lodge an  appeal for nullification.\" This formality over, they proceeded to open  Sainte-Croix's closet: the key was handed to the commissary Picard by a  Carmelite called Friar Victorin. The commissary opened the door, and  entered with the parties interested, the officers, and the widow, and  they began by setting aside the loose papers, with a view to taking them  in order, one at a time. While they were thus busy, a small roll fell  down, on which these two words were written: \"My Confession.\" All  present, having no reason to suppose Sainte-Croix a bad man, decided  that this paper ought not to be read. The deputy for the attorney  general on being consulted was of this opinion, and the confession of  Sainte-Croix was burnt. This act of conscience performed, they proceeded  to make an inventory. One of the first objects that attracted the  attention of the officers was the box claimed by Madame de Brinvilliers.  Her insistence had provoked curiosity, so they began with it. Everybody  went near to see what was in it, and it was opened.    We shall let the report speak: in such cases nothing is so effective or  so terrible as the official statement.    \"In the closet of Sainte-Croix was found a small box one foot square, on  the top of which lay a half-sheet of paper entitled 'My Will,' written  on one side and containing these words: 'I humbly entreat any into whose  hands this chest may fall to do me the kindness of putting it into the  hands of Madame the Marquise de Brinvilliers, resident in the rue  Neuve-Saint-Paul, seeing that all the contents concern and belong to her  alone, and are of no use to any person in the world apart from herself:  in case of her being already dead before me, the box and all its  contents should be burnt without opening or disturbing anything. And  lest anyone should plead ignorance of the contents, I swear by the God I  worship and by all that is most sacred that no untruth is here asserted.  If anyone should contravene my wishes that are just and reasonable in  this matter, I charge their conscience therewith in discharging my own  in this world and the next, protesting that such is my last wish.    \"'Given at Paris, the 25th of May after noon, 1672. Signed by  Sainte-Croix,'    \"And below were written these words: 'There is one packet only addressed  to M. Penautier which should be delivered.'\"    It may be easily understood that a disclosure of this kind only  increased the interest of the scene; there was a murmur of curiosity,  and when silence again reigned, the official continued in these words:    \"A packet has been found sealed in eight different places with eight  different seals. On this is written: 'Papers to be burnt in case of my  death, of no consequence to anyone. I humbly beg those into whose hands  they may fall to burn them. I give this as a charge upon their  conscience; all without opening the packet.' In this packet we find two  parcels of sublimate.    \"Item, another packet sealed with six different seals, on which is a  similar inscription, in which is found more sublimate, half a pound in  weight.    \"Item, another packet sealed with six different seals, on which is a  similar inscription, in which are found three parcels, one containing  half an ounce of sublimate, the second 2 1/4 ozs. of Roman vitriol, and  the third some calcined prepared vitriol. In the box was found a large  square phial, one pint in capacity, full of a clear liquid, which was  looked at by M. Moreau, the doctor; he, however, could not tell its  nature until it was tested.    \"Item, another phial, with half a pint of clear liquid with a white  sediment, about which Moreau said the same thing as before.    \"Item, a small earthenware pot containing two or three lumps of prepared  opium.    \"Item, a folded paper containing two drachms of corrosive sublimate  powdered.    \"Next, a little box containing a sort of stone known as infernal stone.    \"Next, a paper containing one ounce of opium.    \"Next, a piece of pure antimony weighing three ounces.    \"Next, a packet of powder on which was written: 'To check the flow of  blood.' Moreau said that it was quince flower and quince buds dried.    \"Item, a pack sealed with six seals, on which was written, 'Papers to be  burnt in case of death.' In this twenty-four letters were found, said to  have been written by the Marquise de Brinvilliers.    \"Item, another packet sealed with six seals, on which a similar  inscription was written. In this were twenty-seven pieces of paper on  each of which was written: 'Sundry curious secrets.'    \"Item, another packet with six more seals, on which a similar  inscription was written. In this were found seventy-five livres,  addressed to different persons. Besides all these, in the box there were  two bonds, one from the marquise for 30,000, and one from Penautier for  10,000 francs, their dates corresponding to the time of the deaths of M.  d'Aubray and the Sieur de St. Laurent.\"    The difference in the amount shows that Sainte-Croix had a tariff, and  that parricide was more expensive than simple assassination. Thus in his  death did Sainte-Croix bequeath the poisons to his mistress and his  friend; not content with his own crimes in the past, he wished to be  their accomplice in the future.    The first business of the officials was to submit the different  substances to analysis, and to experiment with them on animals. The  report follows of Guy Simon, an apothecary, who was charged to undertake  the analysis and the experiments:    \"This artificial poison reveals its nature on examination. It is so  disguised that one fails to recognise it, so subtle that it deceives the  scientific, so elusive that it escapes the doctor's eye: experiments  seem to be at fault with this poison, rules useless, aphorisms  ridiculous. The surest experiments are made by the use of the elements  or upon animals. In water, ordinary poison falls by its own weight. The  water is superior, the poison obeys, falls downwards, and takes the  lower place.    \"The trial by fire is no less certain: the fire evaporates and disperses  all that is innocent and pure, leaving only acrid and sour matter which  resists its influence. The effect produced by poisons on animals is  still more plain to see: its malignity extends to every part that it  reaches, and all that it touches is vitiated; it burns and scorches all  the inner parts with a strange, irresistible fire.    \"The poison employed by Sainte-Croix has been tried in all the ways, and  can defy every experiment. This poison floats in water, it is the  superior, and the water obeys it; it escapes in the trial by fire,  leaving behind only innocent deposits; in animals it is so skilfully  concealed that no one could detect it; all parts of the animal remain  healthy and active; even while it is spreading the cause of death, this  artificial poison leaves behind the marks and appearance of life. Every  sort of experiment has been tried. The first was to pour out several  drops of the liquid found into oil of tartar and sea water, and nothing  was precipitated into the vessels used; the second was to pour the same  liquid into a sanded vessel, and at the bottom there was found nothing  acrid or acid to the tongue, scarcely any stains; the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27560"],[0,"The 2005 CIA World Factbook (#5)"],[1,"station, overgrazing,  and desertification.  ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy  emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by  the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and  has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.  water-born diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are  transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.    Environment - international agreements  This entry separates country participation in international  environmental agreements into two levels - party to and signed, but not  ratified. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the  abbreviated form of the full name.    Environmental agreements  This information is presented in Appendix C: Selected International  Environmental Agreements, which includes the name, abbreviation, date  opened for signature, date entered into force, objective, and parties  by category.    Ethnic groups  This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups starting with  the largest and normally includes the percent of total population.    Exchange rates  This entry provides the official value of a country's monetary unit at  a given date or over a given period of time, as expressed in units of  local currency per US dollar and as determined by international market  forces or official fiat.    Executive branch  This entry includes several subfields. Chief of state includes the name  and title of the titular leader of the country who represents the state  at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the  day-to-day activities of the government. Head of government includes  the name and title of the top administrative leader who is designated  to manage the day-to-day activities of the government. For example, in  the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is  the head of government. In the US, the president is both the chief of  state and the head of government. Cabinet includes the official name  for this body of high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of  members. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.  Election results includes the percent of vote for each candidate in the  last election.    Exports  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise exports  on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are calculated on an  exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Exports - commodities  This entry provides a rank ordering of exported products starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Exports - partners  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Fiscal year  This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for a country's  accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar year but  which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for the  calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).    Flag description  This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual  flags or the best information available at the time the entry was  written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies  unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and  other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at the beginning of  the country profile. The flag graphics were produced from actual flags  or the best information available at the time of preparation. The flags  of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is an  officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not  have flags.    GDP (purchasing power parity)  This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final  goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar  estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power parity  (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more  information.    GDP - composition by sector  This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture, industry,  and services to total GDP. The distribution will total less than 100  percent if the data are incomplete.    GDP - per capita  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by  population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation  and expressed as a percent.    GDP methodology  In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than  from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method  involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights,  which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services  produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP method  provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic  strength and well-being between countries. The division of a GDP  estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in  dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD  countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries  are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on  extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International  Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan  Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In  contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of  international and domestic financial forces that often have little  relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak  currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically  one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates  may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or  official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January  1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community  (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their  currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of  these countries by half. One important caution: the proportion of, say,  defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts  may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts are  expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to  estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures.  Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data cannot be chained  together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in  the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies,  use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national  statistical methods and practices.    GNP  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic  production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather  than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad  may be important to national well-being.    GWP  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value of  all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Geographic coordinates  This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the  purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and  is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August  1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.    Geographic names  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of  Geographic Names. It includes a listing of various alternate names,  former names, local names, and regional names referenced to one or more  related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but not always, those  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names and  additional information are included in parentheses.

Definitions of the major  governmental terms are as follows:  Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought  about by the absence of governmental authority.  Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.  Communism - a system of government in which the state plans and  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party holds  power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of private  ownership of property or capital while claiming to make progress toward  a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the  people (i.e., a classless society).
