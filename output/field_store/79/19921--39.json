All yearly references are for the  calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).    Flag description  This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual  flags or the best information available at the time the entry was  written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies  unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and  other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at the beginning of  the country profile. The flag graphics were produced from actual flags  or the best information available at the time of preparation. The flags  of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is an  officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not  have flags.    GDP  This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final  goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar  estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power parity  (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more  information.    GDP methodology  In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are  derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than  from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method  involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights,  which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services  produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP method  provide the best available starting point for comparisons of economic  strength and well-being between countries. The division of a GDP  estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in  dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD  countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries  are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on  extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International  Comparison Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan  Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In  contrast, the currency exchange rate method involves a variety of  international and domestic financial forces that often have little  relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak  currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically  one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates  may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or  official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January  1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community  (whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their  currencies by 50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of  these countries by half. One important caution: the proportion of, say,  defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local currency accounts  may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts are  expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to  estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures.  Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be chained  together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in  the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies,  use of new or different sources of information, and changes in national  statistical methods and practices.    GDP - composition by sector  This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture, industry,  and services to total GDP.    GDP - per capita  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by  population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation  and expressed as a percent.    Geographic coordinates  This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the  purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and  is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August  1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.    Geographic names  This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of  Geographic Names.  It includes a listing of various alternate names,  former names, local names, and regional names referenced to one or more  related Factbook entries. Spellings are normally, but not always, those  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names and  additional information are included in parentheses.    Geography  This category includes the entries dealing with the natural environment  and the effects of human activity.    Geography - note  This entry includes miscellaneous geographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    GNP  Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and  services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned  by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic  production. The Factbook, following current practice, uses GDP rather  than GNP to measure national production. However, the user must realize  that in certain countries net remittances from citizens working abroad  may be important to national well-being.    Government  This category includes the entries dealing with the system for the  adoption and administration of public policy.    Government type  This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g., republic,  constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary democracy,  military dictatorship).    Government - note  This entry includes miscellaneous government information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Gross domestic product  see GDP    Gross national product  see GNP    Gross world product  see GWP    GWP  This entry gives the gross world product (GWP) or aggregate value of  all final goods and services produced worldwide in a given year.    Heliports  This entry gives the total number of established helicopter takeoff and  landing sites (which may or may not have fuel or other services).    Highways  This entry states the total length of the highway system and the length  of the paved and unpaved parts.    HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate  This entry gives an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged 15-49)  living with HIV/AIDS. The adult prevalence rate is calculated by  dividing the estimated number of adults living with HIV/AIDS at yearend  by the total adult population at yearend.    HIV/AIDS - deaths  This entry gives an estimate of the number of adults and children who  died of AIDS during a given calendar year.    HIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS  This entry gives an estimate of all people (adults and children) alive  at yearend with HIV infection, whether or not they have developed  symptoms of AIDS.    Household income or consumption by percentage share  Data on household income or consumption come from household surveys,  the results adjusted for household size. Nations use different  standards and procedures in collecting and adjusting the data. Surveys  based on income will normally show a more unequal distribution than  surveys based on consumption. The quality of surveys is improving with  time, yet caution is still necessary in making inter-country  comparisons.    Hydrographic data codes  see Data codes    Illicit drugs  This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs -  narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27559"],[0,"The 2004 CIA World Factbook (#5)"],[1,"- a rotating cultivation technique in  which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for  temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines  at which point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this  practice is sustainable while population levels are low and time is  permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these  conditions do not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences  for the environment .       soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity  because of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of  pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or  erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.       soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,  and desertification.       ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic  energy emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper  atmosphere by the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living  organisms and has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in  humans.       water-born diseases - those in which the bacteria survive in, and  is transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.
