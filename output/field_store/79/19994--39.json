Parotitis sometimes arises from a  blow or contusion severe enough to set up inflammation in the structure of  the gland. Tuberculosis and actinomycosis may infrequently be characterized  by the lodgment of their parasitic causes in the parotid glands, in which  case parotitis may be a symptom of either of these diseases.    _Symptoms._--There is an elongated, painful swelling, beginning at the base  of the ear and passing downward along the posterior margin of the lower  jaw. The swelling is sometimes limited to one side, and when both are  swollen it is generally larger on one side than on the other. The secretion  of saliva is increased, the appetite is poor, the neck is stiff, so that it  is painful to raise the head, and feed is swallowed with difficulty. In  many cases the swelling of the glands, when submitted to proper treatment,  disappears in a comparatively short time. In other cases, however, they  remain enlarged, even after the animal recovers its appetite. In  tuberculosis, lymphatic glands beneath the parotid glands are sometimes  enlarged, thus causing the appearance of enlarged parotid glands.    _Treatment._--A warm bran poultice, made by mixing bran with a hot 2 per  cent compound cresol solution in water, should be applied on the swollen  gland and kept in place by means of a bandage. Whenever the poultice has  cooled it should be replaced by a new one. This treatment should be  continued until the pain is less and the swelling is reduced or until there  is evidence of pus formation, which may be ascertained by examining the  surface of the gland with the fingers; and when, on pressing any part of  the surface, it is found to fluctuate or \"give,\" then we may conclude that  there is a collection of pus at that place. It is well not to open the  abscess until the fluctuation is well marked, as at this stage the pus or  matter is near the surface and there is less trouble in healing the wound  than if the pus is deep seated. The abscess should be opened with a clean,  sharp knife. The poulticing should then be continued for two or three days,  but the form of the poultice should be changed, by replacing the bran with  absorbent cotton and pouring the compound cresol solution on the cotton. At  all times the wound should be kept clean and the cavity injected once or  twice daily with a solution of 1 dram of carbolic acid in 8 ounces of  water. Under this treatment the pus may cease and the wound heal without  complications. Saliva may issue from the orifice and result in the  formation of a salivary fistula. This requires operative treatment by a  qualified veterinarian. When poulticing fails to reduce the swelling or  produce softening, the inflamed area may be rubbed once daily with  camphorated oil, compound iodin ointment, or painted twice daily with  Lugol's solution of iodin. The diet should be as recommended under  Pharyngitis (p. 17).      PHARYNGEAL POLYPI.    Tumors form not infrequently in the pharynx, and may give rise to a train  of symptoms varying according to their size and location. The tumor may be  so situated that by shifting its position a little it may partially  obstruct the posterior nares (nostrils), when, of course, it will render  nasal breathing very noisy and labored. In another situation its partial  displacement may impede the entrance of air into the larynx. In almost any  part of the pharynx, but especially near the entrance of the gullet, tumors  interfere with the act of swallowing. As they are frequently attached to  the wall of the pharynx by a pedicel or stalk, it will be seen that they  may readily be displaced in different directions so as to produce the  symptoms before described. Enlarged postpharyngeal lymphatic glands are not  rare in tuberculosis, and by pressing upon the wall of the pharynx and  restricting the lumen of this organ they cause difficulty in both breathing  and swallowing. Such enlarged glands may be differentiated from tumors by  passing the hand into the cow's throat after the jaws are separated by a  suitable speculum or gag.    _Treatment._--The method of treatment in such cases is to separate the  animal's jaws with an instrument termed a gag, and then, after drawing the  tongue partially forward, to pass the hand into the pharynx and to twist  the tumor gently from its attachment. One veterinarian who has had  considerable practice in treating this form of disease scrapes through the  attachment of the tumor gradually with his thumb nail. When the attachment  is too strong to be severed in this way an instrument like a thimble, but  possessing a sharp edge at the end, may be used to effect the same purpose,  or the base of the tumor may be severed by the use of a crushing instrument  known as an ecraseur.      CHOKING.    Choking usually happens from attempting to swallow too large an object,  such as a turnip, potato, beet, apple, or pear, though in rare cases it may  occur from bran, chaff, or some other finely divided feed lodging in and  filling up a portion of the gullet. This latter form of the accident is  most likely to occur in animals that are greedy feeders.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms vary somewhat according to the part of the gullet  or throat in which the obstruction is. In most cases there is a discharge  of saliva from the mouth; the animal coughs frequently, and when it drinks  the water is soon ejected. The cow stops eating and stands back from the  trough, the expression is troubled, breathing is accelerated, and  oftentimes there is bloating as a result of the retention of gas in the  paunch. These symptoms, however, are not always present, for if the  obstacle does not completely close the throat or gullet, gas and water may  pass, thus ameliorating the discomfort. If the obstruction is in the neck  portion of the gullet, it may be felt as a lump in the left jugular gutter.    _Treatment._--If the object is in the throat, it is advisable to put a gag  in the animal's mouth, and, while the head is held in a horizontal  direction by two assistants, to pass the hand into the pharynx, grasp the  foreign body, and withdraw it gradually and steadily. When the substance is  lodged in the upper part of the gullet, pressure should be made by an  assistant in an upward direction against the object while the operator  passes his hand into the pharynx, and if the assistant can not by pressure  dislodge the substance from the gullet, the operator may by passing his  middle finger above and partly behind the substance gradually slide it into  the pharynx and then withdraw it by the mouth.    The presence of an obstructing substance in the cervical (neck) portion of  the gullet may be ascertained by passing the hand along the left side of  the neck, when a hard and painless swelling will be found to indicate the  presence of the foreign body. In such cases we must endeavor by gentle and  persevering pressure with the thumb and next two fingers to slide the  obstructing substance gradually upward to the pharynx. To facilitate this  it is well to give the animal a half pint of raw linseed or olive oil  before the manipulations described are commenced. When the substance has  been brought into or nearly into the pharynx, then the mouth gag should be  used, the tongue drawn partially forward with the left hand, and the right  should be passed backward into the pharynx to withdraw the obstruction.    When bran or chaff causes the trouble it is best to give a small quantity  of oil to lubricate the walls of the gullet, and then by gentle and  persevering pressure, to endeavor to separate and divide the mass and to  work it downward toward the stomach. This will be assisted by pouring small  quantities of oil and water down the animal's throat. It is not advisable  to use the probang to push down any soft material, such as oats or chaff,  as this generally condenses and renders firmer the obstructing substance by  pressing its particles or elements together, so that it forms a solid,  resisting mass which can not be moved.    In some cases the foreign body, either because it is in the chest portion  of the esophagus, and so beyond reach, or because too firmly seated, can  not be dislodged from the neck by pressing and manipulating that part  externally. In such event we must resort to the use of the probang. (Pl.  III, figs. 2 and 3.) A probang is a flexible instrument and adapts itself  to the natural curvature of the gullet, and if used cautiously there is not  much risk of injury. Before passing the probang, a gag which has an  aperture at each end, from which straps pass to be buckled at the back of  the head below the horns, is introduced into the mouth. (Pl. III, fig. 4.)  The probang should then be oiled, and, the head and neck being held in a  straight line by two assistants, the tongue must be partly drawn out of the  mouth, the probang cautiously passed along the roof of the mouth into the  pharynx and thence into the gullet, through which it is passed down. If  resistance is met, gentle and continuous pressure must be used, under the  influence of which the object will generally in a short time pass into the  stomach. One must be careful not to pass the probang into the larynx and  thence into the windpipe, as an animal may readily be killed in this way.  This accident is indicated by efforts to cough and by violently disturbed  breathing. If such symptoms arise the probang must be withdrawn at once. To  avoid a wrong passage, the end of the tube should be pressed very slowly  through the throat until its presence in the esophagus is assured. After it  is once in the esophagus care is still necessary, because the walls of this  tube may easily be torn.    Some writers have advised that when the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#5)"],[1," corresponding rise of prices, which for a  while the States attempted to control. But in 1778 Congress threw up its  hands in despair and voted that \"all limitations of prices of gold and  silver be taken off,\" although the States for some time longer continued  to endeavor to regulate prices by legislation.* The fluctuating value  of the currency increased the opportunities for speculation which  war conditions invariably offer, and \"immense fortunes were suddenly  accumulated.\" A new financial group rose into prominence composed  largely of those who were not accustomed to the use of money and who  were consequently inclined to spend it recklessly and extravagantly.           * W. E. H. Lecky, \"The American Revolution,\" New York, 1898,       pp. 288-294.      Many contemporaries comment upon these things, of whom Brissot de  Warville may be taken as an example, although he did not visit the  United States until 1788:    \"The inhabitants... prefer the splendor of wealth and the show of  enjoyment to the simplicity of manners and the pure pleasures which  result from it. If there is a town on the American continent where the  English luxury displays its follies, it is New York. You will find here  the English fashions: in the dress of the women you will see the most  brilliant silks, gauzes, hats, and borrowed hair; equipages are rare,  but they are elegant; the men have more simplicity in their dress; they  disdain gewgaws, but they take their revenge in the luxury of the table;  luxury forms already a class of men very dangerous to society; I mean  bachelors; the expense of women causes matrimony to be dreaded by men.  Tea forms, as in England, the basis of parties of pleasure; many things  are dearer here than in France; a hairdresser asks twenty shilling a  month; washing costs four shillings a dozen.\"*           *Quoted by Henry Tuckerman, \"America and her Commentators,\"  1886.      An American writer of a later date, looking back upon his earlier years,  was impressed by this same extravagance, and his testimony may well be  used to strengthen the impression which it is the purpose of the present  narrative to convey:    \"The French and British armies circulated immense sums of money in gold  and silver coin, which had the effect of driving out of circulation  the wretched paper currency which had till then prevailed. Immense  quantities of British and French goods were soon imported: our people  imbibed a taste for foreign fashions and luxury; and in the course of  two or three years, from the close of the war, such an entire change had  taken place in the habits and manners of our inhabitants, that it almost  appeared as if we had suddenly become a different nation. The staid  and sober habits of our ancestors, with their plain home-manufactured  clothing, were suddenly laid aside, and European goods of fine quality  adopted in their stead. Fine rues, powdered heads, silks and scarlets,  decorated the men; while the most costly silks, satins, chintzes,  calicoes, muslins, etc., etc., decorated our females. Nor was their diet  less expensive; for superb plate, foreign spirits, wines, etc., etc.,  sparkled on the sideboards of many farmers. The natural result of this  change of the habits and customs of the people--this aping of European  manners and morals, was to suddenly drain our country of its circulating  specie; and as a necessary consequence, the people ran in debt, times  became difficult, and money hard to raise.\"*           *Samuel Kercheval, \"History of the Valley of Virginia,\" 1833,  pp. 199-200.      The situation was serious, and yet it was not as dangerous or even as  critical as it has generally been represented, because the fundamental  bases of American prosperity were untouched. The way by which Americans  could meet the emergency and recover from the hard times was fairly  evident first to economize, and then to find new outlets for their  industrial energies. But the process of adjustment was slow and painful.  There were not a few persons in the United States who were even disposed  to regret that Americans were not safely under British protection  and prospering with Great Britain, instead of suffering in political  isolation.        CHAPTER III. THE CONFEDERATION    When peace came in 1783 there were in the United States approximately  three million people, who were spread over the whole Atlantic coast  from Maine to Georgia and back into the interior as far as the Alleghany  Mountains; and a relatively small number of settlers had crossed the  mountain barrier. About twenty per cent of the population, or some  six hundred thousand, were negro slaves. There was also a large alien  element of foreign birth or descent, poor when they arrived in America,  and, although they had been able to raise themselves to a position of  comparative comfort, life among them was still crude and rough. Many  of the people were poorly educated and lacking in cultivation and  refinement and in a knowledge of the usages of good society. Not only  were they looked down upon by other nations of the world; there was  within the United States itself a relatively small upper class inclined  to regard the mass of the people as of an inferior order.    Thus, while forces were at work favorable to democracy, the gentry  remained in control of affairs after the Revolution, although their  numbers were reduced by the emigration of the Loyalists and their power  was lessened. The explanation of this aristocratic control may be found  in the fact that the generation of the Revolution had been accustomed  to monarchy and to an upper class and that the people were wont to  take their ideas and to accept suggestions from their betters without  question or murmur. This deferential attitude is attested by the  indifference of citizens to the right of voting. In our own day, before  the great extension of woman suffrage, the number of persons voting  approximated twenty per cent of the population, but after the Revolution  less than five per cent of the white population voted. There were many  limitations upon the exercise of the suffrage, but the small number of  voters was only partially due to these restrictions, for in later years,  without any radical change in suffrage qualifications, the proportion of  citizens who voted steadily increased.    The fact is that many of the people did not care to vote. Why should  they, when they were only registering the will or the wishes of their  superiors? But among the relatively small number who constituted the  governing class there was a high standard of intelligence. Popular  magazines were unheard of and newspapers were infrequent, so that men  depended largely upon correspondence and personal intercourse for the  interchange of ideas. There was time, however, for careful reading of  the few available books; there was time for thought, for writing, for  discussion, and for social intercourse. It hardly seems too much to say,  therefore, that there was seldom, if ever, a people-certainly never  a people scattered over so wide a territory-who knew so much about  government as did this controlling element of the people of the United  States.    The practical character, as well as the political genius, of the  Americans was never shown to better advantage than at the outbreak of  the Revolution, when the quarrel with the mother country was manifesting  itself in the conflict between the Governors, and other appointed  agents of the Crown, and the popularly elected houses of the colonial  legislatures. When the Crown resorted to dissolving the legislatures,  the revolting colonists kept up and observed the forms of government.  When the legislature was prevented from meeting, the members would come  together and call themselves a congress or a convention, and, instead of  adopting laws or orders, would issue what were really nothing more  than recommendations, but which they expected would be obeyed by their  supporters. To enforce these recommendations extra-legal committees,  generally backed by public opinion and sometimes concretely supported by  an organized \"mob,\" would meet in towns and counties and would be often  effectively centralized where the opponents of the British policy were  in control.    In several of the colonies the want of orderly government became so  serious that, in 1775, the Continental Congress advised them to form  temporary governments until the trouble with Great Britain had been  settled. When independence was declared Congress recommended to all the  States that they should adopt governments of their own. In accordance  with that recommendation, in the course of a very few years each  State established an independent government and adopted a written  constitution. It was a time when men believed in the social contract  or the \"compact theory of the state,\" that states originated through  agreement, as the case might be, between king and nobles, between king  and people, or among the people themselves. In support of this doctrine  no less an authority than the Bible was often quoted, such a passage for  example as II Samuel v, 3: \"So all the elders of Israel came to the King  to Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before  the Lord; and they anointed David King over Israel.\" As a philosophical  speculation to explain why people were governed or consented to be  governed, this theory went back at least to the Greeks, and doubtless  much earlier; and, though of some significance in medieval thought, it  became of greater importance in British political philosophy, especially  through the works of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. A very practical  application of the compact theory was made in the English Revolution of  1688, when in order to avoid the embarrassment of deposing the king, the  convention of the Parliament adopted the resolution: \"That King James  the Second, having endeavored to subvert the Constitution of"]]]
