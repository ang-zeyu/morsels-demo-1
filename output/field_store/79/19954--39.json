Having treated at some length the apparatus used for converting water  into high-pressure steam, we may pass at once to a consideration of the  mechanisms which convert the energy of steam into mechanical motion, or  _work_.    Steam-engines are of two kinds:--(1) _reciprocating_, employing  cylinders and cranks; (2) _rotary_, called turbines.      RECIPROCATING ENGINES.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Sketch showing parts of a horizontal  steam-engine.]    Fig. 17 is a skeleton diagram of the simplest form of reciprocating  engine. C is a _cylinder_ to which steam is admitted through the  _steam-ways_[3] W W, first on one side of the piston P, then on the  other. The pressure on the piston pushes it along the cylinder, and the  force is transmitted through the piston rod P R to the _connecting rod_  C R, which causes the _crank_ K to revolve. At the point where the two  rods meet there is a \"crosshead,\" H, running to and fro in a guide to  prevent the piston rod being broken or bent by the oblique thrusts and  pulls which it imparts through C R to the crank K. The latter is keyed  to a _shaft_ S carrying the fly-wheel, or, in the case of a locomotive,  the driving-wheels. The crank shaft revolves in bearings. The internal  diameter of a cylinder is called its _bore_. The travel of the piston is  called its _stroke_. The distance from the centre of the shaft to the  centre of the crank pin is called the crank's _throw_, which is half of  the piston's _stroke_. An engine of this type is called double-acting,  as the piston is pushed alternately backwards and forwards by the steam.  When piston rod, connecting rod, and crank lie in a straight line--that  is, when the piston is fully out, or fully in--the crank is said to be  at a \"dead point;\" for, were the crank turned to such a position, the  admission of steam would not produce motion, since the thrust or pull  would be entirely absorbed by the bearings.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Sectional plan of a horizontal engine.]      DOUBLE-CYLINDER ENGINES.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]    Locomotive, marine, and all other engines which must be started in any  position have at least _two_ cylinders, and as many cranks set at an  angle to one another. Fig. 19 demonstrates that when one crank, C_1,  of a double-cylinder engine is at a \"dead point,\" the other, C_2, has  reached a position at which the piston exerts the maximum of turning  power. In Fig. 20 each crank is at 45 deg. with the horizontal, and both  pistons are able to do work. The power of one piston is constantly  increasing while that of the other is decreasing. If _single_-action  cylinders are used, at least _three_ of these are needed to produce a  perpetual turning movement, independently of a fly-wheel.      THE FUNCTION OF THE FLY-WHEEL.    A fly-wheel acts as a _reservoir of energy_, to carry the crank of a  single-cylinder engine past the \"dead points.\" It is useful in all  reciprocating engines to produce steady running, as a heavy wheel acts  as a drag on the effects of a sudden increase or decrease of steam  pressure. In a pump, mangold-slicer, cake-crusher, or chaff-cutter, the  fly-wheel helps the operator to pass _his_ dead points--that is, those  parts of the circle described by the handle in which he can do little  work.      THE CYLINDER.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Diagrammatic section of a cylinder and its  slide-valve.]    The cylinders of an engine take the place of the muscular system of the  human body. In Fig. 21 we have a cylinder and its slide-valve shown in  section. First of all, look at P, the piston. Round it are white  grooves, R R, in which rings are fitted to prevent the passage of steam  past the piston. The rings are cut through at one point in their  circumference, and slightly opened, so that when in position they press  all round against the walls of the cylinder. After a little use they  \"settle down to their work\"--that is, wear to a true fit in the  cylinder. Each end of the cylinder is closed by a cover, one of which  has a boss cast on it, pierced by a hole for the piston rod to work  through. To prevent the escape of steam the boss is hollowed out true to  accommodate a _gland_, G^1, which is threaded on the rod and screwed  up against the boss; the internal space between them being filled with  packing. Steam from the boiler enters the steam-chest, and would have  access to both sides of the piston simultaneously through the  steam-ways, W W, were it not for the      SLIDE-VALVE,    a hollow box open at the bottom, and long enough for its edges to cover  both steam-ways at once. Between W W is E, the passage for the exhaust  steam to escape by. The edges of the slide-valve are perfectly flat, as  is the face over which the valve moves, so that no steam may pass under  the edges. In our illustration the piston has just begun to move towards  the right. Steam enters by the left steam-way, which the valve is just  commencing to uncover. As the piston moves, the valve moves in the same  direction until the port is fully uncovered, when it begins to move back  again; and just before the piston has finished its stroke the steam-way  on the right begins to open. The steam-way on the left is now in  communication with the exhaust port E, so that the steam that has done  its duty is released and pressed from the cylinder by the piston.  _Reciprocation_ is this backward and forward motion of the piston: hence  the term \"reciprocating\" engines. The linear motion of the piston rod is  converted into rotatory motion by the connecting rod and crank.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Perspective section of cylinder.]    The use of a crank appears to be so obvious a method of producing this  conversion that it is interesting to learn that, when James Watt  produced his \"rotative engine\" in 1780 he was unable to use the crank  because it had already been patented by one Matthew Wasborough. Watt was  not easily daunted, however, and within a twelvemonth had himself  patented five other devices for obtaining rotatory motion from a piston  rod. Before passing on, it may be mentioned that Watt was the father of  the modern--that is, the high-pressure--steam-engine; and that, owing to  the imperfection of the existing machinery, the difficulties he had to  overcome were enormous. On one occasion he congratulated himself because  one of his steam-cylinders was only three-eighths of an inch out of  truth in the bore. Nowadays a good firm would reject a cylinder 1/500 of  an inch out of truth; and in small petrol-engines 1/5000 of an inch is  sometimes the greatest \"limit of error\" allowed.      [Illustration: FIG. 23.--The eccentric and its rod.]    THE ECCENTRIC    is used to move the slide-valve to and fro over the steam ports (Fig.  23). It consists of three main parts--the _sheave_, or circular plate S,  mounted on the crank shaft; and the two _straps_ which encircle it, and  in which it revolves. To one strap is bolted the \"big end\" of the  eccentric rod, which engages at its other end with the valve rod. The  straps are semicircular and held together by strong bolts, B B, passing  through lugs, or thickenings at the ends of the semicircles. The sheave  has a deep groove all round the edges, in which the straps ride. The  \"eccentricity\" or \"throw\" of an eccentric is the distance between C^2,  the centre of the shaft, and C^1, the centre of the sheave. The throw  must equal half of the distance which the slide-valve has to travel over  the steam ports. A tapering steel wedge or key, K, sunk half in the  eccentric and half in a slot in the shaft, holds the eccentric steady  and prevents it slipping. Some eccentric sheaves are made in two parts,  bolted together, so that they may be removed easily without dismounting  the shaft.    The eccentric is in principle nothing more than a crank pin so  exaggerated as to be larger than the shaft of the crank. Its convenience  lies in the fact that it may be mounted at any point on a shaft, whereas  a crank can be situated at an end only, if it is not actually a V-shaped  bend in the shaft itself--in which case its position is of course  permanent.      SETTING OF THE SLIDE-VALVE AND ECCENTRIC.    The subject of valve-setting is so extensive that a full exposition  might weary the reader, even if space permitted its inclusion. But  inasmuch as the effectiveness of a reciprocating engine depends largely  on the nature and arrangement of the valves, we will glance at some of  the more elementary principles.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]    In Fig. 24 we see in section the slide-valve, the ports of the cylinder,  and part of the piston. To the right are two lines at right angles--the  thicker, C, representing the position of the crank; the thinner, E, that  of the eccentric. (The position of an eccentric is denoted  diagrammatically by a line drawn from the centre of the crank shaft  through the centre of the sheave.) The edges of the valve are in this  case only broad enough to just cover the ports--that is, they have no  _lap_. The piston is about to commence its stroke towards the left; and  the eccentric, which is set at an angle of 90 deg. in _advance_ of the  crank, is about to begin opening the left-hand port. By the time that C  has got to the position originally occupied by E, E will be horizontal  (Fig. 25)--that is, the eccentric will have finished its stroke towards  the left; and while C passes through the next right angle the valve will  be closing the left port, which will cease to admit steam when the  piston has come to the end of its travel. The operation is repeated on  the right-hand side while the piston returns.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]    It must be noticed here--(1) that steam is admitted at full pressure  _all through_ the stroke; (2) that admission begins and ends  simultaneously with the stroke. Now, in actual practice it is necessary  to admit steam before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28569"],[0,"Makers of Many Things (#5)"],[1,"permanent. When we  wish to know what people thought about any event fifty years ago, we  can look back to the papers of that time; but when people fifty years  from now wish to learn what we thought, many of the newspapers will  have fallen to pieces long before that time.    [Illustration: _Courtesy S. D. Warren Co._    WHERE RAGS BECOME PAPER    The vat where the rags cook and turn over, and the big room where the  web of finished paper is passed through rollers and cut into a neat  pile of trimmed sheets.]    There is, however, a method called the \"sulphite process,\" used  principally in treating the coniferous woods, by which a much better  paper can be made. In all plants there is a substance called  \"cellulose.\" This is what gives strength to their stems. The wood is  chipped and put into digesters large enough to hold twenty tons, and  is steam-cooked together with bisulphite of magnesium or calcium for  seven or eight hours. Another method used for cooking such woods as  poplar and gum, is to boil the wood in caustic soda, which destroys  everything except the cellulose. Wood paper of one kind or another is  used for all daily papers and for most books. Whether the best wood  paper will last as long as the best rag paper, time only can tell.    The Government of the United States tests paper in several ways  before buying it. First, a single sheet is weighed; then a ream is  put on the scales to see if it weighs four hundred and eighty times  as much. This shows whether the paper runs evenly in weight. Many  sheets are folded together and measured to see if the thickness is  regular. To test its strength, a sheet is clamped over a hole one  square inch in area, and liquid is pressed against it from below to  see how much it will stand before bursting. Strips of the paper are  pulled in a machine to test its breaking strength. A sheet is folded  over and over again to see whether holes will appear at the corners  of the folds. It is examined under the microscope to see of what  kind of fibers it is made and how much loading has been used in its  manufacture. To test blotting paper, strips are also put into water  to see how high the water will rise on them.    Besides writing and wrapping papers and the various kinds of board,  there are many sorts which are used for special purposes. India paper,  for instance, is light, smooth, and strong, so opaque that printing  will not show through it, and so lasting that if it is crumpled, it  can be ironed out and be as good as new. This is used for books that  are expected to have hard wear but must be of light weight. There are  tissue papers, crepe papers for napkins, and tarred paper to make  roofs and even boats water-tight. If tar is brushed on, it may make  bubbles which will break afterwards and let water in; but if tar is  made a part of the paper itself, it lasts. Paper can easily be waxed  or paraffined, and will then keep out air and moisture for some time.  Better still, it can be treated with oil and will then make a raincoat  that will stand a year's wear, or even, if put on a bamboo frame, make  a very good house, as the Japanese found out long ago. Paper coated  with powdered gum and tin is used for packing tea and coffee. Transfer  or carbon papers so much used in making several copies of an article  on the typewriter are made by coating paper with starch, flour, gum,  and coloring matter. Paper can be used for shoes and hats, ties,  collars, and even for \"rubbers.\" It has been successfully used for  sails for light vessels, and is excellent made into light garments  for hospital use because it is so cheap that it can be burned after  wearing. Wood pulp can be run through fine tubes into water and made  so pliable that it can be twisted into cord or spun and woven into  \"silk.\" Not only water but also fire can be kept out by paper if it is  treated with the proper substances. An object can be covered with a  paste of wood pulp, silica, and hemp; and when this is dry, a coat of  water-glass will afford considerable protection. There has been some  degree of success in making transparent paper films for moving  pictures; and if these are coated with water-glass, they will not  burn. Paper can be so treated that it will either conduct electricity  or become a nonconductor, as may be desired. In Germany, a \"sandwich  paper\" has been made by pressing together four layers--felt, pulp,  cotton, pulp--which is cheap and strong and useful for many purposes.    When we come to papier mache, there is no end to the kinds of articles  that are made of it. The papier mache, or _paper pulped_, is made by  kneading old newspapers or wrapping papers with warm water into a  pulp. Clay and coloring are added and something of the nature of glue;  and it is then put into a mould. Sometimes to make it stronger for  large mouldings, bits of canvas or even wire are also used. The best  papier mache is made of pure wood cellulose. The beautiful boxes and  trays covered with lacquer which the Japanese and Chinese make are  formed of this; but it has many much humbler uses than these. Paper  screws are employed in ornamental wood work, and if a hole is begun  for such a screw, it will twist its way into soft wood as well as  steel would do. Barrels of paper reinforced with wire are common. Gear  wheels and belt pulleys are made of papier mache, and even the wheels  of railroad coaches; at least the body of the wheels is made of it,  although the tire, hub, and axle are of cast-steel. Circular saws of  pulp are in use which cut thin slices of veneer so smoothly that they  can be used without planing. Papier mache is used for water pipes,  the bodies of carriages, hencoops, and garages. Indeed, it is quite  possible to build a house, shingle it, decorate it with elaborate  mouldings and cornices, finish it with panels, wainscoting, imitation  tiling, and furnish it with light, comfortable furniture covered with  imitation leather, silk, or cloth, and spread on its floors soft,  thick carpets or rugs woven in beautiful designs--and all made of wood  pulp. Even the window panes could be made of pulp; and if they were  not perfectly transparent, they would at least let in a soft,  agreeable light, and they would not break. Pails, washtubs, bathtubs,  and even dishes of paper can be easily found. There are not only the  paper cups provided on railroad trains and the cheap picnic plates  and saucers, but some that are really pretty. Ice cream is sometimes  served in paper dishes and eaten with paper spoons. Milk bottles are  successfully made of paper, with a long strip of some transparent  material running up and down the side to show how much--or how  little--cream is within. Napkins and tablecloths made of paper thread  woven into \"cloth\" are cheaper than linen and can be washed as easily.  Paper towels and dishcloths are already common; but when paper shall  fully come to its own, it is quite possible that there will be little  washing of dishes. They can be as pretty as any one could wish, but so  cheap that after each meal they can be dropped into the fire. Indeed,  there are few things in a house, except a stove, that cannot be made  of some form of paper,--and perhaps that too will be some day.          V    HOW BOOKS ARE MADE      The first step in making ready to print a manuscript is to find out  how many words there are in it, what kind of type to use, how much  \"leading\" or space between the lines there shall be, and what shall  be the size of the page. In deciding these questions, considerable  thinking has to be done. If the manuscript is a short story by a  popular author, it may be printed with wide margins and wide leading  in order to make a book of fair size. If it is a lengthy manuscript  which will be likely to sell at a moderate but not a high price, it  is best to use only as much leading as is necessary to make the line  stand out clearly, and to print with a margin not so wide as to  increase the expense of the book. The printer prints a sample of the  page decided upon, any desired changes are made, and then the making  of the book begins.    [Illustration: _Courtesy The Riverside Press._    WHERE THIS BOOK WAS SET UP    The monotype girl wrote these words on her keyboard, where they made  tiny holes in a roll of paper. The roll went to the casting-room where  it guided a machine to make the type much as a perforated music-roll  guides a piano to play a tune.]    The type is kept in a case at which the compositor stands. This case  is divided into shallow compartments, each compartment containing a  great many e's or m's as the case may be. The \"upper case\" contains  capitals; the \"lower case,\" small letters. Those letters which are  used most often are put where the compositor can reach them most  readily. He stands before his case with a \"composing stick\" in his  hand. This \"stick\" is a little iron frame with a slide at the side,  so that the line can be made of any length desired. The workman soon  learns where each letter is, and even an apprentice can set the type  in his stick reasonably rapidly. On one side of every piece of type  there is a groove, so that he can tell by touch whether it is right  side up or not. He must look out especially to make his right-hand  margins regular. You will notice in books that the lines are all of  the same length, although they do not contain the same number of  letters. The compositor brings this about by arranging his words and  spaces skillfully. The spaces must be as nearly as possible of the  same length, and yet the line must be properly filled. If a line is  too full, he can sometimes place the last syllable on the following  line; if it is not full enough, he can borrow a syllable, and he can  at least divide his space so evenly that the line will not look as if  it were broken in two.    Not many years ago all type was set in this manner; but several  machines have now been invented which"]]]
