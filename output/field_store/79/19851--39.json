Is he in?\"    \"If you mean Mr. Reefer, he is,\" said the maid quite respectfully.  Evidently the _Chronicle_'s name carried weight in the Reid  establishment. \"Please come into the library. I'll go and tell him.\"    Patty had just time to seat herself at the table, spread out her paper  imposingly, and assume a businesslike air when Mr. Reefer came in. He  was a tall, handsome old man with white hair, jet-black eyes, and a  mouth that made Patty hope she wouldn't stumble on any questions he  wouldn't want to answer. Patty knew she would waste her breath if she  did. A man with a mouth like that would never tell anything he didn't  want to tell.    \"Good afternoon. What can I do for you, madam?\" inquired Mr. Reefer  with the air and tone of a man who means to be courteous, but has no  time or information to waste.    Patty was almost overcome by the \"Madam.\" For a moment, she quailed.  She couldn't ask that masculine sphinx questions! Then the thought of  her mother's pale, careworn face flashed across her mind, and all her  courage came back with an inspiriting rush. She bent forward to look  eagerly into Mr. Reefer's carved, granite face, and said with a frank  smile:    \"I have come to interview you on behalf of the _Chronicle_ about the  railroad bill. It was my brother who had the assignment, but he has  missed his train and I have come in his place because, you see, it is  so important to us. So much depends on this assignment. Perhaps Mr.  Harmer will give Clifford a permanent place on the staff if he turns  in a good article about you. He is only handyman now. I just couldn't  let him miss the chance--he might never have another. And it means so  much to us and Mother.\"    \"Are you a member of the _Chronicle_ staff yourself?\" inquired Mr.  Reefer with a shade more geniality in his tone.    \"Oh, no! I've nothing to do with it, so you won't mind my being  inexperienced, will you? I don't know just what I should ask you, so  won't you please just tell me everything about the bill, and Mr.  Harmer can cut out what doesn't matter?\"    Mr. Reefer looked at Patty for a few moments with a face about as  expressive as a graven image. Perhaps he was thinking about the bill,  and perhaps he was thinking what a bright, vivid, plucky little girl  this was with her waiting pencil and her air that strove to be  businesslike, and only succeeded in being eager and hopeful and  anxious.    \"I'm not used to being interviewed myself,\" he said slowly, \"so I  don't know very much about it. We're both green hands together, I  imagine. But I'd like to help you out, so I don't mind telling you  what I think about this bill, and its bearing on certain important  interests.\"    Mr. Reefer proceeded to tell her, and Patty's pencil flew as she  scribbled down his terse, pithy sentences. She found herself asking  questions too, and enjoying it. For the first time, Patty thought she  might rather like politics if she understood them--and they did not  seem so hard to understand when a man like Mr. Reefer explained them.  For half an hour he talked to her, and at the end of that time Patty  was in full possession of his opinion on the famous railroad bill in  all its aspects.    \"There now, I'm talked out,\" said Mr. Reefer. \"You can tell your news  editor that you know as much about the railroad bill as Andrew Reefer  knows. I hope you'll succeed in pleasing him, and that your brother  will get the position he wants. But he shouldn't have missed that  train. You tell him that. Boys with important things to do mustn't  miss trains. Perhaps it's just as well he did in this case though,  but tell him not to let it happen again.\"    Patty went straight home, wrote up her interview in ship-shape form,  and took it down to the _Chronicle_ office. There she found Mr.  Harmer, scowling blackly. The little news editor looked to be in a  rather bad temper, but he nodded not unkindly to Patty. Mr. Harmer  knew the Baxters well and liked them, although he would have  sacrificed them all without a qualm for a \"scoop.\"    \"Good evening, Patty. Take a chair. That brother of yours hasn't  turned up yet. The next time I give him an assignment, he'll manage to  be on hand in time to do it.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Patty breathlessly, \"please, Mr. Harmer, I have the  interview here. I thought perhaps I could do it in Clifford's place,  and I went out to Mr. Reid's and saw Mr. Reefer. He was very kind  and--\"    \"Mr. who?\" fairly shouted Mr. Harmer.    \"Mr. Reefer--Mr. Andrew Reefer. He told me to tell you that this  article contained all he knew or thought about the railroad bill  and--\"    But Mr. Harmer was no longer listening. He had snatched the neatly  written sheets of Patty's report and was skimming over them with a  practised eye. Then Patty thought he must have gone crazy. He danced  around the office, waving the sheets in the air, and then he dashed  frantically up the stairs to the composing room.    Ten minutes later, he returned and shook the mystified Patty by the  hand.    \"Patty, it's the biggest beat we've ever had! We've scooped not only  the _Ledger_, but every other newspaper in the country. How did you do  it? How did you ever beguile or bewitch Andrew Reefer into giving you  an interview?\"    \"Why,\" said Patty in utter bewilderment, \"I just went out to Mr.  Reid's and asked for the gentleman who was visiting there--I'd  forgotten his name--and Mr. Reefer came down and I told him my  brother had been detailed to interview him on behalf of the  _Chronicle_ about the bill, and that Clifford had missed his train,  and wouldn't he let me interview him in his place and excuse my  inexperience--and he did.\"    \"It wasn't Andrew Reefer I told Clifford to interview,\" laughed Mr.  Harmer. \"It was John C. Keefe. I didn't know Reefer was in town, but  even if I had I wouldn't have thought it a particle of use to send a  man to him. He has never consented to be interviewed before on any  known subject, and he's been especially close-mouthed about this bill,  although men from all the big papers in the country have been after  him. He is notorious on that score. Why, Patty, it's the biggest  journalistic fish that has ever been landed in this office. Andrew  Reefer's opinion on the bill will have a tremendous influence. We'll  run the interview as a leader in a special edition that is under way  already. Of course, he must have been ready to give the information to  the public or nothing would have induced him to open his mouth. But to  think that we should be the first to get it! Patty, you're a brick!\"    Clifford came home on the seven o'clock train, and Patty was there to  meet him, brimful of her story. But Clifford also had a story to tell  and got his word in first.    \"Now, Patty, don't scold until you hear why I missed the train. I met  Mr. Peabody of the Steel and Iron Company at Mr. Moreland's and got  into conversation with him. When he found out who I was, he was  greatly interested and said Father had been one of his best friends  when they were at college together. I told him about wanting to get  the position in the company, and he had me go right out to the works  and see about it. And, Patty, I have the place. Goodbye to the grind  of newspaper items and fillers. I tried to get back to the station at  Bancroft in time to catch the train but I couldn't, and it was just as  well, for Mr. Keefe was suddenly summoned home this afternoon, and  when the three-thirty train from town stopped at Bancroft he was on  it. I found that out and I got on, going to the next station with him  and getting my interview after all. It's here in my notebook, and I  must hurry up to the office and hand it in. I suppose Mr. Harmer will  be very much vexed until he finds that I have it.\"    \"Oh, no. Mr. Harmer is in a very good humour,\" said Patty with dancing  eyes. Then she told her story.    The interview with Mr. Reefer came out with glaring headlines, and the  _Chronicle_ had its hour of fame and glory. The next day Mr. Harmer  sent word to Patty that he wanted to see her.    \"So Clifford is leaving,\" he said abruptly when she entered the  office. \"Well, do you want his place?\"    \"Mr. Harmer, are you joking?\" demanded Patty in amazement.    \"Not I. That stuff you handed in was splendidly written--I didn't have  to use the pencil more than once or twice. You have the proper  journalist instinct all right. We need a lady on the staff anyhow, and  if you'll take the place it's yours for saying so, and the permanency  next month.\"    \"I'll take it,\" said Patty promptly and joyfully.    \"Good. Go down to the Symphony Club rehearsal this afternoon and  report it. You've just ten minutes to get there,\" and Patty joyfully  and promptly departed.          Anna's Love Letters      \"Are you going to answer Gilbert's letter tonight, Anna?\" asked Alma  Williams, standing in the pantry doorway, tall, fair, and grey-eyed,  with the sunset light coming down over the dark firs, through the  window behind her, and making a primrose nimbus around her shapely  head.    Anna, dark, vivid, and slender, was perched on the edge of the table,  idly swinging her slippered foot at the cat's head. She smiled  wickedly at Alma before replying.    \"I am not going to answer it tonight or any other night,\" she said,  twisting her full, red lips in a way that Alma had learned to dread.  Mischief was ripening in Anna's brain when that twist was out.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Alma anxiously.    \"Just what I say, dear,\" responded Anna, with deceptive meekness.  \"Poor Gilbert is gone, and I don't intend to bother my head about him  any longer. He was amusing while he lasted, but of what use is a beau  two thousand miles away, Alma?\"    Alma was patient--outwardly. It was never of any avail to show  impatience with Anna.    \"Anna, you are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24878"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1909 to 1922 (#5)"],[1,"like that.\"    \"Would you like,\" said Miss Trevor, watching him closely, \"to live  always in a town and have all the books you wanted and play with real  girls and boys--and visit those strange lands your twin sailors tell  you of?\"    Paul looked startled.    \"I--don't--know,\" he said doubtfully. \"I don't think I'd like it very  well if Stephen and Nora weren't there too.\"    But the new thought remained in his mind. It came back to him at  intervals, seeming less new and startling every time.    \"And why not?\" Miss Trevor asked herself. \"The boy should have a  chance. I shall never have a son of my own--he shall be to me in the  place of one.\"    The day came when Paul at last showed her the foolscap book. He  brought it to her as she sat on the rocks of the headland.    \"I'm going to run around and talk to Nora while you read it,\" he said.  \"I'm afraid I've been neglecting her lately--and I think she feels  it.\"    Miss Trevor took the foolscap book. It was made of several sheets of  paper sewed together and encased in an oilcloth cover. It was nearly  filled with writing in a round childish hand and it was very neat,  although the orthography was rather wild and the punctuation  capricious. Miss Trevor read it through in no very long time. It was a  curious medley of quaint thoughts and fancies. Conversations with the  Twin Sailors filled many of the pages; accounts of Paul's \"adventures\"  occupied others. Sometimes it seemed impossible that a child of eleven  should have written them, then would come an expression so boyish and  naive that Miss Trevor laughed delightedly over it. When she finished  the book and closed it she found Stephen Kane at her elbow. He  removed his pipe and nodded at the foolscap book.    \"What do you think of it?\" he said.    \"I think it is wonderful. Paul is a very clever child.\"    \"I've often thought so,\" said Stephen laconically. He thrust his hands  into his pockets and gazed moodily out to sea. Miss Trevor had never  before had an opportunity to talk to him in Paul's absence and she  determined to make the most of it.    \"I want to know something about Paul,\" she said, \"all about him. Is he  any relation to you?\"    \"No. I expected to marry his mother once, though,\" said Stephen  unemotionally. His hand in his pocket was clutching his pipe fiercely,  but Miss Trevor could not know that. \"She was a shore girl and very  pretty. Well, she fell in love with a young fellow that came teaching  up t' the harbour school and he with her. They got married and she  went away with him. He was a good enough sort of chap. I know that  now, though once I wasn't disposed to think much good of him. But  'twas a mistake all the same; Rachel couldn't live away from the  shore. She fretted and pined and broke her heart for it away there in  his world. Finally her husband died and she came back--but it was too  late for her. She only lived a month--and there was Paul, a baby of  two. I took him. There was nobody else. Rachel had no relatives nor  her husband either. I've done what I could for him--not that it's been  much, perhaps.\"    \"I am sure you have done a great deal for him,\" said Miss Trevor  rather patronizingly. \"But I think he should have more than you can  give him now. He should be sent to school.\"    Stephen nodded.    \"Maybe. He never went to school. The harbour school was too far away.  I taught him to read and write and bought him all the books I could  afford. But I can't do any more for him.\"    \"But I can,\" said Miss Trevor, \"and I want to. Will you give Paul to  me, Mr. Kane? I love him dearly and he shall have every advantage. I'm  rich--I can do a great deal for him.\"    Stephen continued to gaze out to sea with an expressionless face.  Finally he said: \"I've been expecting to hear you say something of the  sort. I don't know. If you took Paul away, he'd grow to be a cleverer  man and a richer man maybe, but would he be any better--or happier?  He's his mother's son--he loves the sea and its ways. There's nothing  of his father in him except his hankering after books. But I won't  choose for him--he can go if he likes--he can go if he likes.\"    In the end Paul \"liked,\" since Stephen refused to influence him by so  much as a word. Paul thought Stephen didn't seem to care much whether  he went or stayed, and he was dazzled by Miss Trevor's charm and the  lure of books and knowledge she held out to him.    \"I'll go, I guess,\" he said, with a long sigh.    Miss Trevor clasped him close to her and kissed him maternally. Paul  kissed her cheek shyly in return. He thought it very wonderful that he  was to live with her always. He felt happy and excited--so happy and  excited that the parting when it came slipped over him lightly. Miss  Trevor even thought he took it too easily and had a vague wish that he  had shown more sorrow. Stephen said farewell to the boy he loved  better than life with no visible emotion.    \"Good-bye, Paul. Be a good boy and learn all you can.\" He hesitated a  moment and then said slowly, \"If you don't like it, come back.\"    \"Did you bid good-bye to your rock people?\" Miss Trevor asked him with  a smile as they drove away.    \"No. I--couldn't--I--I--didn't even tell them I was going away. Nora  would break her heart. I'd rather not talk of them anymore, if you  please. Maybe I won't want them when I've plenty of books and lots of  other boys and girls--real ones--to play with.\"    They drove the ten miles to the town where they were to take the train  the next day. Paul enjoyed the drive and the sights of the busy  streets at its end. He was all excitement and animation. After they  had had tea at the house of the friend where Miss Trevor meant to  spend the night, they went for a walk in the park. Paul was tired and  very quiet when they came back. He was put away to sleep in a bedroom  whose splendours frightened him, and left alone.    At first Paul lay very still on his luxurious perfumed pillows. It was  the first night he had ever spent away from the little seaward-looking  loft where he could touch the rafters with his hands. He thought of it  now and a lump came into his throat and a strange, new, bitter longing  came into his heart. He missed the sea plashing on the rocks below  him--he could not sleep without that old lullaby. He turned his face  into the pillow, and the longing and loneliness grew worse and hurt  him until he moaned. Oh, he wanted to be back home! Surely he had not  left it--he could never have meant to leave it. Out there the stars  would be shining over the harbour. Stephen would be sitting at the  door, all alone, with his violin. But he would not be playing it--all  at once Paul knew he would not be playing it. He would be sitting  there with his head bowed and the loneliness in his heart calling to  the loneliness in Paul's heart over all the miles between them. Oh, he  could never have really meant to leave Stephen.    And Nora? Nora would be down on the rocks waiting for him--for him,  Paul, who would never come to her more. He could see her elfin little  face peering around the point, watching for him wistfully.    Paul sat up in bed, choking with tears. Oh, what were books and  strange countries?--what was even Miss Trevor, the friend of a  month?--to the call of the sea and Stephen's kind, deep eyes and his  dear rock people? He could not stay away from them--never--never.    He slipped out of bed very softly and dressed in the dark. Then he  lighted the lamp timidly and opened the little brown chest Stephen had  given him. It held his books and his treasures, but he took out only a  pencil, a bit of paper and the foolscap book. With a hand shaking in  his eagerness, he wrote:        _dear miss Trever_        _Im going back home, dont be fritened about me because I know      the way. Ive got to go. something is calling me. dont be      cross. I love you, but I cant stay. Im leaving my foolscap      book for you, you can keep it always but I must go back to      Stephen and nora_                                                     _Paul_    He put the note on the foolscap book and laid them on the table. Then  he blew out the light, took his cap and went softly out. The house was  very still. Holding his breath, he tiptoed downstairs and opened the  front door. Before it ran the street which went, he knew, straight out  to the country road that led home. Paul closed the door and stole down  the steps, his heart beating painfully, but when he reached the  sidewalk he broke into a frantic run under the limes. It was late and  no one was out on that quiet street. He ran until his breath gave  out, then walked miserably until he recovered it, and then ran again.  He dared not stop running until he was out of that horrible town,  which seemed like a prison closing around him, where the houses shut  out the stars and the wind could only creep in a narrow space like a  fettered, cringing thing, instead of sweeping grandly over great salt  wastes of sea.    At last the houses grew few and scattered, and finally he left them  behind. He drew a long breath; this was better--rather smothering yet,  of course, with nothing but hills and fields and dark woods all about  him, but at least his own sky was above him, looking just the same as  it looked out home at Noel's Cove. He recognized the stars as friends;  how often Stephen had pointed them out to him as they sat at night by  the door of the little house.    He was not at all frightened now. He knew the way home and the kind  night was before him. Every step was bringing him nearer to Stephen  and Nora and the Twin Sailors. He whistled as he walked sturdily  along.    The dawn was just breaking when he reached Noel's Cove. The eastern  sky was all pale rose and silver, and the sea was mottled over with  dear grey ripples. In the west over the harbour the sky was a very  fine ethereal blue and the wind blew from there, salt and bracing.  Paul was tired, but he ran lightly "]]]
