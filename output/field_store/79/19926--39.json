Land use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total  land area for five different types of land use. Arable  land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after each  harvest like wheat, maize, and rice. Permanent crops--land  cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each  harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber. Permanent  pastures--land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops.  Forests and woodland--land under dense or open stands of  trees. Other--any land type not specifically mentioned above,  such as urban areas, roads, desert, etc.    Languages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages  starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent  of total population speaking that language.    Legal system: This entry contains a brief description of the  legal system's historical roots, role in government, and  acceptance of International Court of Justice (ICJ)  jurisdiction.    Legislative branch: This entry contains information on the  structure (unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name,  number of seats, and term of office. Elections includes the  nature of election process or accession to power, date of  the last election, and date of the next election. Election  results includes the percent of vote and/or number of seats  held by each party in the last election.    Life expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average  number of years to be lived by a group of people born in the  same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in the  future. The entry includes total population as well as the  male and female components. Life expectancy at birth is also  a measure of overall quality of life in a country and  summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be thought  of as indicating the potential return on investment in human  capital and is necessary for the calculation of various  actuarial measures.    Literacy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and  Census Bureau percentages for the total population, males,  and females. There are no universal definitions and  standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates  are based on the most common definition--the ability to read  and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that  individual countries use to assess the ability to read and  write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on  literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational  results, is probably the most easily available and valid for  international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and  education in general, can impede the economic development of  a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven  world.    Location: This entry identifies the country's regional  location, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of  water.    Map references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook  reference map on which a country may be found. The entry on  Geographic coordinates may be helpful in finding some  smaller countries.    Maritime claims: This entry includes the following claims:  contiguous zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone,  exclusive fishing zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually  for a landlocked country), other (unique maritime claims  like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North Korea's  Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The proximity  of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from  being extended the full distance.    Merchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships  engaged in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as  opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs,  fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a grouping of  merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry  contains information in two subfields--total and ships by  type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or  over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those  ships. Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers,  bulk cargo ships, cargo ships, combination bulk carriers,  combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, intermodal  ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers,  multifunction large--load carriers, oil tankers, passenger  ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated  cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea  passenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and  vehicle carriers.    A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a  territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively  for the use of ships owned in the parent country; it is also  referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent  of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will  fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local variant  of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation  rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a  captive register makes it especially desirable for ships  owned in the parent country, just as in the internal  register, the ships may also be owned abroad. The captive  register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except  that it is not the register of an independent state.    A flag of convenience register is a national register  offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the  flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract  ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or  nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning  requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having  relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the  flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for  ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is  one where the majority of the merchant fleet is owned  abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.    A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and  which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship,  whether at home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag  state determines how a ship is crewed and taxed and whether  a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. An  internal register is a register of ships maintained as a  subset of a national register. Ships on the internal  register fly the national flag and have that nationality but  are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those  on the main national register. These differences usually  include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals  as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag  state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian  International Ship Register and Danish International Ship  Register are the most notable examples of an internal  register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight  from the national flag to flags of convenience and in  attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish  flags.    A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against  payment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any  nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial  vessels only.    A register is the record of a ship's ownership and  nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a  country; also, it is the compendium of such individual  ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it  with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the  country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of  the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.    Military: This category includes the entries dealing with a  country's military structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military branches: This entry lists the names of the ground,  naval, air, marine, and other defense or security forces.    Military expenditures--dollar figure: This entry gives  current military expenditures in US dollars; the figure is  calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in  percentage terms by the gross domestic product (GDP)  calculated on an exchange rate basis not purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms. The figure should be treated with  caution because of different price patterns and accounting  methods among nations, as well as wide variations in the  strength of their currencies.    Military expenditures--percent of GDP: This entry gives  current military expenditures as an estimated percent of  gross domestic product (GDP).    Military manpower--availability: This entry gives the total  numbers of males and females age 15-49 and assumes that  every individual is fit to serve.    Military manpower--fit for military service: This entry gives  the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military  service. This is a more refined measure of potential  military manpower availability which tries to correct for  the health situation in the country and reduces the maximum  potential number to a more realistic estimate of the actual  number fit to serve.    Military manpower--military age: This entry gives the minimum  age at which an individual may volunteer for military  service or be subject to conscription.    Military manpower--reaching military age annually: This entry  gives the number of draft-age males and females entering the  military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of  the availability of draft-age young adults.    Military--note: This entry includes miscellaneous military  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Money figures: All money figures are expressed in  contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise indicated.    National holiday: This entry gives the primary national day  of celebration--usually independence day.    Nationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for  citizens--noun and adjective.    Natural hazards: This entry lists potential natural  disasters.    Natural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral,  petroleum, hydropower, and other resources of commercial  importance.

Joel was consoled, as his  mother assured him in a satisfactory way that she never should think  of blaming him; and Phronsie was comforted and coddled to her heart's  content. And so the evening passed rapidly and happily away; Ben  smuggling Phronsie off into a corner, where she told him all the doings  of the day--the disappointment of the cake, and how it was finally  crowned with flowers; all of which Phronsie, with no small pride in  being the narrator, related gravely to her absorbed listener. \"And don't  you think, Bensie,\" she said, clasping her little hand in a convincing  way over his two bigger, stronger ones, \"that Polly's stove was very  naughty to make poor Polly cry?\"    \"Yes, I do,\" said Ben, and he shut his lips tightly together.    To have Polly cry, hurt him more than he cared to have Phronsie see.    \"What are you staring at, Joe?\" asked Polly, a few minutes later, as her  eyes fell upon Joel, who sat with his back to the cupboard, persistently  gazing at the opposite wall.    \"Why, you told me yourself not to look at the cupboard,\" said Joel, in  the loudest of stage whispers.    \"Dear me; that'll make mammy suspect worse'n anything else if you look  like that,\" said Polly.    \"What did you say about the cupboard?\" asked Mrs. Pepper, who caught  Joe's last word.    \"We can't tell,\" said Phronsie, shaking her head at her mother; \"cause  there's a ca----\" \"Ugh!\" and Polly clapped her hand on the child's  mouth; \"don't you want Ben to tell us a story?\"    \"Oh, yes!\" cried little Phronsie, in which all the others joined with  a whoop of delight; so a most wonderful story, drawn up in Ben's best  style, followed till bedtime.    The first thing Polly did in the morning, was to run to the old  cupboard, followed by all the others, to see if the cake was safe; and  then it had to be drawn out, and dressed anew with the flowers, for they  had decided to have it on the breakfast table.    \"It looks better,\" whispered Polly to Ben, \"than it did yesterday; and  aren't the flowers pretty?\"    \"It looks good enough to eat, anyway,\" said Ben, smacking his lips.    \"Well, we tried,\" said Polly, stilling a sigh; \"now, boys, call mamsie;  everything's ready.\"    Oh! how surprised their mother appeared when she was ushered out to the  feast, and the full glory of the table burst upon her. Her delight in  the cake was fully enough to satisfy the most exacting mind. She  admired and admired it on every side, protesting that she shouldn't have  supposed Polly could possibly have baked it as good in the old stove;  and then she cut it, and gave a piece to every child, with a little posy  on top. Wasn't it good, though! for like many other things, the cake  proved better on trial than it looked, and so turned out to be really  quite a good surprise all around.    \"Why can't I ever have a birthday?\" asked Joel, finishing the last crumb  of his piece; \"I should think I might,\" he added, reflectively.    \"Why, you have, Joe,\" said Ben; \"eight of 'em.\"    \"What a story!\" ejaculated Joel; \"when did I have 'em? I never had a  cake; did I, Polly?\"    \"Not a cake-birthday, Joel,\" said his mother; \"you haven't got to that  yet.\"    \"When's it coming?\" asked Joel, who was decidedly of a matter-of-fact  turn of mind.    \"I don't know,\" said Mrs. Pepper, laughing; \"but there's plenty of time  ahead.\"          TROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE      \"Oh, I do wish,\" said Joel, a few mornings after, pushing back his chair  and looking discontentedly at his bowl of mush and molasses, \"that we  could ever have something new besides this everlasting old breakfast!  Why can't we, mammy?\"    \"Better be glad you've got that, Joe,\" said Mrs. Pepper, taking another  cold potato, and sprinkling on a little salt; \"folks shouldn't complain  so long as they've anything to eat.\"    \"But I'm so tired of it--same old thing!\" growled Joel; \"seems as if I  sh'd turn into a meal-bag or a molasses jug!\"    \"Well, hand it over, then,\" proposed Ben, who was unusually hungry, and  had a hard day's work before him.    \"No,\" said Joel, alarmed at the prospect, and putting in an enormous  mouthful; \"it's better than nothing.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said little Phronsie, catching Joel's tone, \"it isn't nice;  no, it isn't.\" And she put down her spoon so suddenly that the molasses  spun off in a big drop, that trailed off the corner of the table, and  made Polly jump up and run for the floor-cloth.    \"Oh, Phronsie,\" she said, reprovingly; \"you ought not to. Never mind,  pet,\" as she caught sight of two big tears trying to make a path in the  little molasses-streaked face, \"Polly'll wipe it up.\"    \"Sha'n't we ever have anything else to eat, Polly?\" asked the child,  gravely, getting down from her high chair to watch the operation of  cleaning the floor.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Polly, cheerfully, \"lots and lots--when our ship comes  in.\"    \"What'll they be?\" asked Phronsie, in the greatest delight, prepared for  anything.    \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Polly; \"ice cream for one thing, Phronsie, and  maybe, little cakes.\"    \"With pink on top?\" interrupted Phronsie, getting down by Polly's side.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Polly, warming with her subject; \"ever and ever so much  pink, Phronsie Pepper; more than you could eat!\"    Phronsie just clasped her hands and sighed. More than she could eat was  beyond her!    \"Hoh!\" said Joel, who caught the imaginary bill of fare, \"that's  nothing, Polly. I'd speak for a plum-puddin'.\"    \"Like the one mother made us for Thanksgiving?\" asked Polly, getting up  and waiting a minute, cloth in hand, for the answer.    \"Yes, sir,\" said Joel, shutting one eye and looking up at the ceiling,  musingly, while he smacked his lips in remembrance; \"wasn't that prime,  though!\"    \"Yes,\" said Polly, thoughtfully; \"would you have 'em all like that,  Joe?\"    \"Every one,\" replied Joe, promptly; \"I'd have seventy-five of 'em.\"    \"Seventy-five what?\" asked Mrs. Pepper, who had gone into the bedroom,  and now came out, a coat in hand, to sit down in the west window, where  she began to sew rapidly. \"Better clear up the dishes, Polly, and set  the table back--seventy-five what, Joel?\"    \"Plum-puddings,\" said Joel, kissing Phronsie.    \"Dear me!\" ejaculated Mrs. Pepper; \"you don't know what you're saying,  Joel Pepper; the house couldn't hold 'em!\"    \"Wouldn't long,\" responded Joel; \"we'd eat 'em.\"    \"That would be foolish,\" interposed Ben; \"I'd have roast beef and  fixings--and oysters--and huckleberry pie.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" cried Polly; \"how nice, Ben! you always do think of the very  best things.\"    But Joel phoohed and declared he wouldn't waste his time \"over old beef;  he'd have something like!\" And then he cried:    \"Come on, Dave, what'd you choose?\"    Little Davie had been quietly eating his breakfast amid all this  chatter, and somehow thinking it might make the mother feel badly, he  had refrained from saying just how tiresome he had really found this  \"everlasting breakfast\" as Joel called it. But now he looked up eagerly,  his answer all ready. \"Oh, I know,\" he cried, \"what would be most  beautiful! toasted bread--white bread--and candy.\"    \"What's candy?\" asked Phronsie.    \"Oh, don't you know, Phronsie,\" cried Polly, \"what Mrs. Beebe gave you  the day you got your shoes--the pink sticks; and--\"    \"And the peppermint stick Mr. Beebe gave you, Phronsie,\" finished Joel,  his mouth watering at the remembrance.    \"That day, when you got your toe pounded,\" added Davie, looking at Joel.    \"Oh!\" cried Phronsie; \"I want some now, I do!\"    \"Well, Davie,\" said Polly, \"you shall have that for breakfast when our  ship comes in then.\"    \"Your ships aren't ever coming,\" broke in Mrs. Pepper, wisely, \"if you  sit there talking--folks don't ever make any fortunes by wishing.\"    \"True enough,\" laughed Ben, jumping up and setting back his chair. \"Come  on, Joe; you've got to pile to-day.\"    \"Oh, dear,\" said Joel, dismally; \"I wish Mr. Blodgett's wood was all  a-fire.\"    \"Never say that, Joel,\" said Mrs. Pepper, looking up sternly; \"it's  biting your own nose off to wish that wood was a-fire--and besides it's  dreadfully wicked.\"    Joel hung his head, for his mother never spoke in that way unless she  was strongly moved; but he soon recovered, and hastened off for his  jacket.    \"I'm sorry I can't help you do the dishes, Polly,\" said David, running  after Joel.    \"I'm going to help her,\" said Phronsie; \"I am.\"    So Polly got the little wooden tub that she always used, gave Phronsie  the well-worn cup-napkin, and allowed her to wipe the handleless cups  and cracked saucers, which afforded the little one intense delight.    \"Don't you wish, Polly,\" said little Phronsie, bustling around with a  very important air, nearly smothered in the depths of a big brown  apron that Polly had carefully tied under her chin, \"that you didn't  ever-an'-ever have so many dishes to do?\"    \"Um--maybe,\" said Polly, thoughtlessly. She was thinking of something  else besides cups and saucers just then; of how nice it would be to go  off for just one day, and do exactly as she had a mind to in everything.  She even envied Ben and the boys who were going to work hard at Deacon  Blodgett's woodpile.    \"Well, I tell you,\" said Phronsie, confidentially, setting down a  cup that she had polished with great care, \"I'm going to do 'em all  to-morrow, for you, Polly--I can truly; let me now, Polly, do.\"    \"Nonsense!\" said Polly, giving a great splash with her mop in the tub,  ashamed of her inward repinings. \"Phronsie, you're no bigger than a  mouse!\" "]]]
