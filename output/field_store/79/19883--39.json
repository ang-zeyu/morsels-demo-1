Let us never for a moment rest in such fallacious theories, or accept  the belief of Darwin and Huxley, with a few active agitating disciples,  that animals, and even plants, may pass into each other.       \"I think we are not wholly brain,     Magnetic mockeries; ...     Not only cunning casts in clay;     Let science prove we are, and then     What matters science unto men,     At least to me! I would not stay:     Let him, the wiser man who springs     Hereafter, up from childhood shape     His action, like the greater ape,     But I was born to other things.\"       --_In Memoriam_, cxix.    Darwin and Huxley cannot change nature. They may change their minds and  opinions, as their fathers did before them. It is, we suspect, only the  old heathen materialism cropping out,--       \"Our little systems have their day--     They have their day and cease to be.     They are but broken lights of Thee,     And Thou, O Lord! art more than they.\"       --_In Memoriam._    No artists or authors have ever pictured or described monkeys like Sir  Edwin Landseer and his brother Thomas. Surely a new edition of the  _Monkeyana_ is wanted for the rising generation. Oliver Goldsmith, that  great writer, who was most feeble in knowledge of natural history from  almost total ignorance of the subject, over which he threw the graces of  his charming style, noticed, as remarkable, that in countries \"where the  men are barbarous and stupid, the brutes are the most active and  sagacious.\" He continues, that it is in the torrid tracts, inhabited by  barbarians, that animals are found with instinct so nearly approaching  reason. Both in Africa and America, accordingly, he tells us, \"the  savages suppose monkeys to be men; idle, slothful, rational beings,  capable of speech and conversation, but obstinately dumb, for fear of  being compelled to labour.\"    For the present, I shall suppose that the gorilla, largest of all the  apes, can not only speak, but write; and is speaking and writing to an  orang-utan of Borneo. Even a Lamarckian will allow this to be within the  range of possibility. Were it possible to get Gay or Cowper to write a  new set of fables, animals, in the days of postoffices and letters,  would become, like the age, epistolary. But a word on the imaginary  correspondent.    The orang, as the reader knows, is the great red-haired \"Man of the  Woods,\" as the name may be rendered in English. My old friend, Mr Alfred  Wallace, lately in New Guinea, and the adjoining parts, collecting  natural history subjects, and making all kinds of valuable observations  and surveys, sent to Europe most of the magnificent specimens of this  \"ugly beast\" now in the museum. He has detailed its habits and history  in an able account, published some years ago in \"The Annals and Magazine  of Natural History.\"    Its home seems to be the fine forests which cover many parts of the  coast of Borneo. The home of the gorilla and chimpanzee are in the  tropical forests of the coasts of Western Africa.    There would seem to be but three or four well established _species_ of  these apes, though there are, as in man and most created beings, some  marked or decided varieties. These apes are altogether _quadrupeds_,  adapted for a life among trees. The late Charles Waterton, of Walton  Hall, whom I deem it an honour to have known for many years, personally  and in his writings, has well shown this in his \"Essays on Natural  History.\" Professor Owen, with his osteologies, and old Tyson, with his  anatomies, have each demonstrated that--draw what inferences the  followers of Mr Darwin may choose--monkeys are not men, but quadrupeds.    The structure of chimpanzee, orang, and gorilla considerably resembles  that of man, but so more distantly does a frog's, so does Scheuchzer's  fossil amphibian in the museum, so does a squirrel's, so does a  parrot's. Yet, because parrots, squirrels, frogs, and asses have skulls,  a pelvis, and fore-arms, they are _not_ men any more than fish are.  Linnaeus has given the _real_ specific, the _real_ class, order, and  generic character of man, unique as a species, as a genus, as an order,  or as a class, as even the greatest comparative anatomist of England  regards him; \"Nosce teipsum:\" \"[Greek: Gnothi seauton]\"--KNOW THYSELF.  Man alone expects a hereafter. He is immortal, and anticipates, hopes  for, or dreads a resurrection. Melancholy it is that he alone, as an  American writer curiously remarks, collects bodies of men of _one_ blood  to fight with each other. He alone can become a _drunkard_.    The reader must leave rhapsody, and may now be reminded, in explanation  of allusions in the following letter, that the arm of Dr Livingstone,  the African traveller, was crushed and crunched by the bite and \"chaw\"  of a lion. He will also please to notice, that the skeleton of the  gorilla in the museum has the left arm broken by some dreadful accident.  This injury may _possibly_ have been caused by a fall when young, or  more probably by the empoisoned bite of a larger gorilla, or of a  tree-climbing Leopard. So much may be premised before giving a letter,  supposed to be intercepted on its way between the Gaboon and London, and  London and Borneo, opened at St Martin's-le-Grand, and detained as  unpaid.    \"I was born in a large baobab tree, on the west coast of Africa, not  very far from Calabar. We gorillas are good time-keepers, rise early and  go to bed early, guided infallibly by the sun. But though our family has  been in existence at least six thousand years, we have no chronology,  and care not a straw about our grandfathers. I suppose I had a  grandmother, but I never took _any_ interest in any but very close  relationships.    \"We never toiled for our daily food, and are not idle like these lazy  black fellows who hold their palavers near us, and whom I, for my part,  heartily despise. They cannot climb a tree, as we do, although they can  talk to each other, and make one another slaves. At least they so treat  their countrymen far off where the fine sweet plantains grow, and some  other juicy tit-bits, the memory of which makes my mouth water. These  fellows have ugly wives, not nearly so big-mouthed as ours, without our  noble bony ridge, small ears, and exalted presence. They are actually  forced to walk erect, and their fore-legs seldom touch the ground,  except in the case of piccanninies. These little creatures crawl on the  ground, are much paler when born, and are then perfectly helpless; and  have no hair except on their heads, whereas our beautiful young are  fine and hairy, and can swing among the branches, shortly after birth,  nearly as well as their parents. When I was very young, I could soon  help myself to fruits which abound on our trees.    \"Have you dates, plantains, and soursops--so sweet--at Sarawak, Master  Redhair? We have, and all kinds of them. I should like, for a variety,  to taste yours. Mind you send me some of the _durian_.[6] Make haste and  send it, for Wallace's description makes my mouth water.    \"I have told you our little ones soon learn to help themselves, whereas  I have seen the piccaninnies of the blacks nursed by their mothers till  many rainy seasons had come and gone. I really think nothing of the  talking blacks who live near us. They put on bits of coloured rags, not  nearly so bright, so regular, nor so _contrasting_ as the feathers of  our birds.    \"Beautifully coloured are the green touraco and the purple  plantain-eater, a rascally bird! who eats some of our finest plantains,  and has bitten holes in many a one I thought to get entirely to myself.  Why, our parrots beat these West-African negroes to sticks! Even our  common gray parrot, so prettily scaled with gray, and with the red  feathers under his tail, is more natural than these blacks, with their  dirty-white, yellow, blue, green, and red rags.    \"Besides, that gray parrot beats them hollow both in its voice and in  the way it imitates. Do you know that when I have been giving my quick  short bark, to tell that I am not well pleased, I have heard one of  these fellows near me actually make me startle--its bark was so like to  that of one of our kind! I cannot bear the blacks! I have had a grudge  against them since some little urchins shot at me when I was young, and  made my hand bleed. How it bled! My mother, with whom I had been, kept  out of the way of these blackguards, but I was playing with another  little gorilla, and forgot to keep a look-out. I have kept a good  look-out ever since I got _that_ wound, I assure you. I licked it often,  and so did my mother with her delicious mouth. It soon left off bleeding  and healed. We gorillas have no brandy, no whisky, no wine, not even  small beer, to inflame our blood. We sleep, too, among the trees, clear  off the ground, where there are dangerous vapours, so that we are free  from all miasmata. West Africa is my lovely home, and I am big and  beautifully pot-bellied. It is the home of the large-eared chimpanzee, a  near relative of ours, though we never marry. He is an active fellow,  with rather large vulgar-looking ears; while mine, though I ought not to  say so, are beautifully small, and denote my more exalted birth. Master  Chimpanzee needs all his ears, for he is not so strong as I, and as you  will hear, we anthropoids have enemies in our trees, just as you perhaps  have, Master Redhair. We are both cautious of getting on the ground, and  when there, I assure you I keep a sharp look-out.    \"I have told you of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#5)"],[1,"ffs. Turtle doves are so  plentiful in the West that their distribution over every available  feeding ground seems to be a matter of social and economic necessity.    [Illustration: \"_Darting across the turbulent stream_\"    _Turtle Doves_]          BALD PEAKS AND GREEN VALES    [Illustration: PLATE II    GREEN-TAILED TOWHEE--_Pipilo chlorurus_  (Male)    SPURRED TOWHEE--_Pipilo megalonyx_  (Male)]      One of my chief objects in visiting the Rockies was to ascend Pike's  Peak from Manitou, and make observations on the birds from the base to  the summit. A walk one afternoon up to the Halfway House and back--the  Halfway House is only about one-third of the way to the top--convinced  me that to climb the entire distance on foot would be a useless  expenditure of time and effort. An idea struck me: Why not ride up on  the cog-wheel train, and then walk down, going around by some of the  valleys and taking all the time needed for observations on the  avi-faunal tenantry? That was the plan pursued, and an excellent one it  proved.    When the puffing cog-wheel train landed me on the summit, I was fresh  and vigorous, and therefore in excellent condition physically and  mentally to enjoy the scenery and also to ride my hobby at will over the  realm of cloudland. The summit is a bald area of several acres, strewn  with immense fragments of granite, with not a spear of grass visible.  One of the signal-station men asked a friend who had just come up from  the plain, \"Is there anything green down below? I'd give almost  anything to see a green patch of some kind.\" There was a yearning strain  in his tones that really struck me as pathetic. Here were visitors  revelling in the magnificence of the panorama, their pulses tingling and  their feelings in many cases too exalted for expression; but those whose  business or duty it was to remain on the summit day after day soon found  life growing monotonous, and longed to set their eyes on some patch of  verdure. To the visitors, however, who were in hale physical condition,  the panorama of snow-clad ranges and isolated peaks was almost  overwhelming. In the gorges and sheltered depressions of the old  mountain's sides large fields of snow still gleamed in the sun and  imparted to the air a frosty crispness.    When the crowd of tourists, after posing for their photographs, had  departed on the descending car, I walked out over the summit to see what  birds, if any, had selected an altitude of fourteen thousand one hundred  and forty-seven feet above sea-level for their summer home. Below me, to  the east, stretched the gray plains running off to the skyline, while  the foothills and lower mountains, which had previously appeared so high  and rugged and difficult of access, now seemed like ant-hills crouching  at the foot of the giant on whose crown I stood. Off to the southwest,  the west, and the northwest, the snowy ranges towered, iridescent in  the sunlight. In contemplating this vast, overawing scene, I almost  forgot my natural history, and wanted to feast my eyes for hours on its  ever-changing beauty; but presently I was brought back to a  consciousness of my special vocation by a sharp chirp. Was it a bird, or  only one of those playful little chipmunks that abound in the Rockies?  Directly there sounded out on the serene air another ringing chirp, this  time overhead, and, to my delight and surprise, a little bird swung over  the summit, then out over the edge of the cliff, and plunged down into  the fearsome abyss of the \"Bottomless Pit.\" Other birds of the same  species soon followed his example, making it evident that this was not a  birdless region. Unable to identify the winged aeronauts, I clambered  about over the rocks of the summit for a while, then slowly made my way  down the southern declivity of the mountain for a short distance. Again  my ear was greeted with that loud, ringing chirp, and now the bird  uttering it obligingly alighted on a stone not too far away to be seen  distinctly through my binocular. Who was the little waif that had chosen  this sky-invading summit for its summer habitat? At first I mistook it  for a horned lark, and felt so sure my decision was correct that I did  not look at the bird as searchingly as I should have done, thereby  learning a valuable lesson in thoroughness. The error was corrected by  my friend, Mr. Charles E. Aiken, of Colorado Springs, who has been of  not a little service in determining and classifying the avian fauna of  Colorado. My new-found friend (the feathered one, I mean) was the  American pipit, which some years ago was known as the tit-lark.    [Illustration: _Pipits_    \"_Te-cheer! Te-cheer!_\"]    \"Te-cheer! te-cheer! te-cheer!\" (accent strong on the second syllable)  the birds exclaimed in half-petulant remonstrance at my intrusion as I  hobbled about over the rocks. Presently one of them darted up into the  air; up, up, up, he swung in a series of oblique leaps and circles, this  way and that, until he became a mere speck in the sky, and then  disappeared from sight in the cerulean depths beyond. All the while I  could hear his emphatic and rapidly repeated call, \"Te-cheer! te-cheer!\"  sifting down out of the blue canopy. How long he remained aloft in \"his  watch-tower in the skies\" I do not know, for one cannot well count  minutes in such exciting circumstances, but it seemed a long time. By  and by the call appeared to be coming nearer, and the little aeronaut  swept down with a swiftness that made my blood tingle, and alighted on a  rock as lightly as a snowflake. Afterwards a number of other pipits  performed the same aerial exploit. It was wonderful to see them rise  several hundred feet into the rarefied atmosphere over an abyss so deep  that it has been named the \"Bottomless Pit.\"    [Illustration: _Pipits_    \"_Up over the Bottomless Pit_\"]    The pipits frequently flitted from rock to rock, teetering their slender  bodies like sandpipers, and chirping their disapproval of my presence.  They furnished some evidence of having begun the work of nest  construction, although no nests were found, as it was doubtless still  too early in the season. In some respects the pipits are extremely  interesting, for, while many of them breed in remote northern latitudes,  others select the loftiest summits of the Rockies for summer homes,  where they rear their broods and scour the alpine heights in search of  food. The following interesting facts relative to them in this alpine  country are gleaned from Professor Cooke's pamphlet on \"The Birds of  Colorado\":        In migration they are common throughout the State, but breed only on      the loftiest mountains. They arrive on the plains from the South      about the last of April, tarry for nearly a month, then hie to the      upper mountain parks, stopping there to spend the month of May. By      the first of June they have ascended above timber-line to their      summer home amid the treeless slopes and acclivities. Laying begins      early in July, as soon as the first grass is started. Most of the      nests are to be found at an elevation of twelve thousand to thirteen      thousand feet, the lowest known being one on Mount Audubon,      discovered on the third of July with fresh eggs. During the breeding      season these birds never descend below timber-line. The young birds      having left the nest, in August both old and young gather in flocks      and range over the bald mountain peaks in quest of such dainties as      are to the pipit taste. Some of them remain above timber-line until      October although most of them have by that time gone down into the      upper parks of the mountains. During this month they descend to the      plains, and in November return to their winter residence in the      South.    While watching the pipits, I had another surprise. On a small, grassy  area amid the rocks, about a hundred feet below the summit, a  white-crowned sparrow was hopping about on the ground, now leaping upon  a large stone, now creeping into an open space under the rocks, all the  while picking up some kind of seed or nut or insect. It was very  confiding, coming close to me, but vouchsafing neither song nor chirp.  Farther on I shall have more to say about these tuneful birds, but at  this point it is interesting to observe that they breed abundantly  among the mountains at a height of from eight thousand to eleven  thousand feet, while the highest nest known to explorers was twelve  thousand five hundred feet above the sea. One of Colorado's bird men has  noted the curious fact that they change their location between the first  and second broods--that is, in a certain park at an elevation of eight  thousand feet they breed abundantly in June, and then most of them leave  that region and become numerous among the stunted bushes above  timber-line, where they raise a second brood. It only remains to be  proved that the birds in both localities are the same individuals, which  is probable.    On a shoulder of the mountain below me, a flock of ravens alighted on  the ground, walked about awhile, uttered their hoarse croaks, and then  took their departure, apparently in sullen mood. I could not tell  whether they croaked \"Nevermore!\" or not.    Down the mountain side I clambered, occasionally picking a beautiful  blossom from the many brilliant-hued clusters and inhaling its  fragrance. Indeed, sometimes the breeze was laden with the aroma of  these flowers, and in places the slope looked like a cultivated garden.  The only birds seen that afternoon above timber-line were those already  mentioned. What do the birds find to eat in these treeless and shrubless  altitudes? There are many flies, some grasshoppers, bumble-bees,  beetles, and other insects, even in these arctic regions, dwelling among  the rocks and in the short grass below them watered by the melting  snows.    At about half-past four in the afternoon I reached the timber-lin"]]]
