When you go back to your  own country perhaps you will pass through Navarre. At all events you'll  go by Vittoria, which isn't very far off.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, \"I shall certainly pass through Vittoria. But I may very  possibly go round by Pampeluna, and for your sake, I believe I should be  very glad to do it.\"    \"Well, if you do go to Pampeluna, you'll see more than one thing that  will interest you. It's a fine town. I'll give you this medal,\" he  showed me a little silver medal that he wore hung around his neck.  \"You'll wrap it up in paper\"--he paused a moment to master his  emotion--\"and you'll take it, or send it, to an old lady whose address  I'll give you. Tell her I am dead--but don't tell her how I died.\"    I promised to perform his commission. I saw him the next day, and spent  part of it in his company. From his lips I learned the sad incidents  that follow.        CHAPTER III    \"I was born,\" he said, \"at Elizondo, in the valley of Baztan. My name is  Don Jose Lizzarrabengoa, and you know enough of Spain, sir, to know at  once, by my name, that I come of an old Christian and Basque stock. I  call myself Don, because I have a right to it, and if I were at Elizondo  I could show you my parchment genealogy. My family wanted me to go into  the church, and made me study for it, but I did not like work. I was too  fond of playing tennis, and that was my ruin. When we Navarrese begin  to play tennis, we forget everything else. One day, when I had won the  game, a young fellow from Alava picked a quarrel with me. We took to our  _maquilas_,* and I won again. But I had to leave the neighbourhood.  I fell in with some dragoons, and enlisted in the Almanza Cavalry  Regiment. Mountain folks like us soon learn to be soldiers. Before long  I was a corporal, and I had been told I should soon be made a sergeant,  when, to my misfortune, I was put on guard at the Seville Tobacco  Factory. If you have been to Seville you have seen the great building,  just outside the ramparts, close to the Guadalquivir; I can fancy I see  the entrance, and the guard room just beside it, even now. When Spanish  soldiers are on duty, they either play cards or go to sleep. I, like an  honest Navarrese, always tried to keep myself busy. I was making a chain  to hold my priming-pin, out of a bit of wire: all at once, my comrades  said, 'there's the bell ringing, the girls are coming back to work.' You  must know, sir, that there are quite four or five hundred women employed  in the factory. They roll the cigars in a great room into which no man  can go without a permit from the _Veintiquatro_,** because when the  weather is hot they make themselves at home, especially the young ones.  When the work-girls come back after their dinner, numbers of young men  go down to see them pass by, and talk all sorts of nonsense to them.  Very few of those young ladies will refuse a silk mantilla, and men who  care for that sort of sport have nothing to do but bend down and pick  their fish up. While the others watched the girls go by, I stayed on my  bench near the door. I was a young fellow then--my heart was still in  my own country, and I didn't believe in any pretty girls who hadn't  blue skirts and long plaits of hair falling on their shoulders.*** And  besides, I was rather afraid of the Andalusian women. I had not got used  to their ways yet; they were always jeering one--never spoke a single  word of sense. So I was sitting with my nose down upon my chain, when I  heard some bystanders say, 'Here comes the _gitanella_!' Then I lifted  up my eyes, and I saw her! It was that very Carmen you know, and in  whose rooms I met you a few months ago.         * Iron-shod sticks used by the Basques.         ** Magistrate in charge of the municipal police       arrangements, and local government regulations.         *** The costume usually worn by peasant women in Navarre and       the Basque Provinces.    \"She was wearing a very short skirt, below which her white silk  stockings--with more than one hole in them--and her dainty red morocco  shoes, fastened with flame-coloured ribbons, were clearly seen. She had  thrown her mantilla back, to show her shoulders, and a great bunch of  acacia that was thrust into her chemise. She had another acacia blossom  in the corner of her mouth, and she walked along, swaying her hips, like  a filly from the Cordova stud farm. In my country anybody who had seen  a woman dressed in that fashion would have crossed himself. At Seville  every man paid her some bold compliment on her appearance. She had  an answer for each and all, with her hand on her hip, as bold as the  thorough gipsy she was. At first I didn't like her looks, and I fell to  my work again. But she, like all women and cats, who won't come if you  call them, and do come if you don't call them, stopped short in front of  me, and spoke to me.    \"'_Compadre_,' said she, in the Andalusian fashion, 'won't you give me  your chain for the keys of my strong box?'    \"'It's for my priming-pin,' said I.    \"'Your priming-pin!' she cried, with a laugh. 'Oho! I suppose the  gentleman makes lace, as he wants pins!'    \"Everybody began to laugh, and I felt myself getting red in the face,  and couldn't hit on anything in answer.    \"'Come, my love!' she began again, 'make me seven ells of lace for my  mantilla, my pet pin-maker!'    \"And taking the acacia blossom out of her mouth she flipped it at me  with her thumb so that it hit me just between the eyes. I tell you, sir,  I felt as if a bullet had struck me. I didn't know which way to look.  I sat stock-still, like a wooden board. When she had gone into the  factory, I saw the acacia blossom, which had fallen on the ground  between my feet. I don't know what made me do it, but I picked it up,  unseen by any of my comrades, and put it carefully inside my jacket.  That was my first folly.    \"Two or three hours later I was still thinking about her, when a  panting, terrified-looking porter rushed into the guard-room. He told  us a woman had been stabbed in the great cigar-room, and that the guard  must be sent in at once. The sergeant told me to take two men, and go  and see to it. I took my two men and went upstairs. Imagine, sir, that  when I got into the room, I found, to begin with, some three hundred  women, stripped to their shifts, or very near it, all of them screaming  and yelling and gesticulating, and making such a row that you couldn't  have heard God's own thunder. On one side of the room one of the women  was lying on the broad of her back, streaming with blood, with an X  newly cut on her face by two strokes of a knife. Opposite the wounded  woman, whom the best-natured of the band were attending, I saw Carmen,  held by five or six of her comrades. The wounded woman was crying out,  'A confessor, a confessor! I'm killed!' Carmen said nothing at all. She  clinched her teeth and rolled her eyes like a chameleon. 'What's this?'  I asked. I had hard work to find out what had happened, for all the  work-girls talked at once. It appeared that the injured girl had boasted  she had money enough in her pocket to buy a donkey at the Triana Market.  'Why,' said Carmen, who had a tongue of her own, 'can't you do with a  broom?' Stung by this taunt, it may be because she felt herself rather  unsound in that particular, the other girl replied that she knew nothing  about brooms, seeing she had not the honour of being either a gipsy  or one of the devil's godchildren, but that the Senorita Carmen would  shortly make acquaintance with her donkey, when the _Corregidor_ took  her out riding with two lackeys behind her to keep the flies off.  'Well,' retorted Carmen, 'I'll make troughs for the flies to drink  out of on your cheeks, and I'll paint a draught-board on them!'* And  thereupon, slap, bank! She began making St. Andrew's crosses on the  girl's face with a knife she had been using for cutting off the ends of  the cigars.         * _Pintar un javeque_, \"paint a xebec,\" a particular type of       ship. Most Spanish vessels of this description have a       checkered red and white stripe painted around them.    \"The case was quite clear. I took hold of Carmen's arm. 'Sister mine,' I  said civilly, 'you must come with me.' She shot a glance of recognition  at me, but she said, with a resigned look: 'Let's be off. Where is my  mantilla?' She put it over her head so that only one of her great eyes  was to be seen, and followed my two men, as quiet as a lamb. When we  got to the guardroom the sergeant said it was a serious job, and he must  send her to prison. I was told off again to take her there. I put her  between two dragoons, as a corporal does on such occasions. We started  off for the town. The gipsy had begun by holding her tongue. But when we  got to the _Calle de la Serpiente_--you know it, and that it earns its  name by its many windings--she began by dropping her mantilla on to her  shoulders, so as to show me her coaxing little face, and turning round  to me as well as she could, she said:    \"'_Oficial mio_, where are you taking me to?'    \"'To prison, my poor child,' I replied, as gently as I could, just as  any kind-hearted soldier is bound to speak to a prisoner, and especially  to a woman.    \"'Alack! What will become of me! Senor Oficial, have pity on me! You are  so young, so good-looking.' Then, in a lower tone, she said, 'Let me get  away, and I'll give you a bit of the _bar lachi_, that will make every  woman fall in love with you!'    \"The _bar lachi_, sir, is the loadstone, with which the gipsies declare  one who knows how to use it can cast any number of spells. If you can  make a woman drink a little scrap of it, powdered, in a glass of white  wine, she'll never be able to resist you. I answered, as gravely as I  could:    \"'We are not here to talk nonsense. You'l"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#5)"],[1,"nterprise.  He had  apparently learnt by ear several English words and, finding a book full  of blank paper, had written them down, spelling them the best way he  could, that is phonetically, according to Italian pronunciation, and  writing the Italian equivalents, spelt in his own way, in a parallel  column.  His writing is so distinct that I am certain I have got every  letter right, but I do not recognize his second English word for latrina,  it is probably some corrupt form of lavatory.

When he returned from London his English was probably better than the  cabin-boy's will ever be, but he is a little out of practice.    I had observed a couple of picturesque ruffians hovering about in the  gloom of the garden; towards the end of dinner they wandered into the  circle of the electric light and resolved themselves into Carmelo and  Rosario.  We invited them to sit down, gave them wine and cigarettes and  talked over the changes that had taken place in the town since I had last  been there.    When they had gone, I asked Peppino about Rosario's misfortune and learnt  that he had been put into prison for stabbing his father.  He had only  wounded him, and Peppino thought the father had probably been in the  wrong, for he has a bad history in the books of the police, but Rosario  had not done himself any good over it, because, of course, the crime and  its consequences have now gone down into his own history.    An Englishman may be a mass of prejudices, but I confess I did not like  the idea of hob-nobbing with a would-be parricide and determined that  Rosario should not drive me any more; if I wanted a carriage, Carmelo  should get leave of his padrone and take me.    Next morning, while I was having my coffee, there was a sound of passing  music; I recognized it as belonging to a funeral, and asked Peppino if he  knew who was dead.  Several people were dead and he did not know which  this was, unless it was old Baldassare; it must be either a married woman  or a grown-up man.  I asked how he knew that.  He replied that when  apprenticed to his father, who had been sagrestano before taking the  hotel, he had learnt all about the ceremonies of the Church.    \"They do this,\" he said, \"when it is a married lady dead or a grown man.  If it shall be the woman dead unmarried or a boy dead, then shall it be a  different song, a different ring of bell and the dead shall go very  directly in the paradiso; it is like the--please, what is fuochi  artificiali?  Excuse me, it is the rocket; prestissimo and St. Peter he  don't be asking no question.  Did you understand?\"    He then diverged to ceremonies connected with last illnesses--    \"When the doctor is coming it is telling always that you would be good of  the malady, but when the priest is coming it is telling that you are  finished.  This is not a good thing.  It is difficult to hope when the  doctor is shaking the head and is telling 'Please, you; go, catch the  priest quickly, quickly.'  And sometimes the notary, the man of law, if  the malade is having money; if no money, it is the notary not at all.  When the doctor is coming out, the priest is coming in, and generally  after would be the death.  But you must pay.  If to pay less would come  only one priest and not well dressed, if to pay more, very well dressed  and too many priests.  If to pay plenty, plenty, then to ring all the  bells and enter by the great door; but if to pay few, then not many bells  and to enter by the second door.  Did you understand?    \"When they die the parents always, and also the man that is to die, they  fear the--please, what is not the paradiso?  Excuse me, it is the  inferno: and they tell to the priest 'Please come.'  Then they pay him to  tell all that is good, and sometimes the priest arrive that you will be  dead.  If you shall suicide, very likely you are dead before.  Then shall  the parents pay him to tell that the man to die has taken all the  functions of religion and the holy oil to put in the foot to prevent him  the death.  But it is prevent not at all.    \"Did you know what is sacramento?  All right, I shall tell you.  The  priest is going with the sacramento on the hand and the umbrella on the  head and you must pay--always must pay, it is the interesting thing.  And  the old women are going and are praying because the man is dead: and the  soldiers are going and are taking the arms before the risorgimento, but  now the law it is redeemed.  Then they arrive into the room of the malade  and take the sacramento and up and down and put the holy oil in the foot  and pray and went away, and the malade who is not dead would very soonly  die.\"        CHAPTER III--THE PROFESSOR      The day before the festa there came a professor of pedagogy, and Peppino  was not best pleased to see him because he knew him as a jettatore.  I  had supposed this word to mean a person with the evil eye who causes  misfortunes to others, but he used it in the sense of one who causes  misfortunes to himself or, at least, who is always in trouble--a man who  is constitutionally unfortunate, the sort of man with whom Napoleon would  have nothing to do.  He will miss his train more often than not; if he  has to attend a funeral it will be when he has a cold in his head, and  all his white pocket-handkerchiefs will be at the wash, so that he must  use a coloured one; he will attempt to take his medicine in the dark,  thereby swallowing the liniment by mistake.  Of course, this kind of man  is incidentally disastrous to others as well as to himself and is,  therefore, also a jettatore in the other sense, so that Napoleon was  quite right.    The arrival of the professor led Peppino into giving me a great deal of  information about the evil eye in which he swore he did not believe.  It  was all rather indefinite and contradictory, partly, no doubt, because  those who believe in it most firmly are the analfabeti and unaccustomed  to express themselves clearly.    The prevailing idea seems to be that an evil influence proceeds from the  eye of the jettatore who is not necessarily a bad person, at least he  need not be desirous of hurting any one.  The misfortunes that follow  wherever he goes may be averted by the interposition of some attractive  object whereby the glance from his eye is arrested, and either the  misfortune does not happen at all, or the force of the evil influence is  expended elsewhere.  Therefore, it is as well always to carry some charm  against the evil eye.  All over Italy, but especially in the south, it is  rare to meet a man who does not carry a charm, either on his watch-chain  or in his pocket, or on a string or a chain round his neck under his  clothes, and he usually carries more than one.  Women, of course, always  wear them, which may be because a woman likes to surround herself with  pretty things, and, if she can say that they protect her, she has a  reason, unconnected with vanity, which she may be apt to profess is her  true reason for wearing ornaments.  The same applies to men who, though  less in the habit of wearing ornaments, are, as has been often remarked,  no less vain than women.  This may be called the ornamental view and may  account for some of the fashions that arise in the wearing of charms.  But there is also the utilitarian view, and a new form of charm will  sometimes become popular, just as a new sanctuary becomes popular,  because it is reported to have been effective in some particular case.  Probably no change of fashion will ever banish horns made of coral or  mother-of-pearl; being pointed, they are supposed to attract and break up  the evil glance as a lightning conductor is supposed to attract and break  up a flash of lightning.    Peppino was very contemptuous about all charms and coral horns  especially.  Even assuming that horns in a general way are prophylactic,  it is no use having them made of coral or mother-of-pearl and wearing  them on one's watch-chain, because the Padre Eterno, when he designed the  human form, was careful to provide man with natural means of making horns  so that the evil eye might be averted during the period that would have  to elapse before the wearing of ornaments became customary.  We can still  benefit by this happy forethought if we are threatened with the evil eye  when divested of all our charms--when bathing for instance.  The pope,  Pio Nono, was believed to have the evil eye, and pious pilgrims asking  his blessing used, at the same time, to take the precaution of protecting  themselves from his malign influence by pointing two fingers at him under  their clothes.    Inanimate things, of course, cannot be said literally to have the evil  eye, but many of them cause misfortunes.  A"]]]
