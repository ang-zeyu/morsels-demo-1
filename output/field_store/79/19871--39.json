At last no champion would face the monster, and the Danes, in  despair, deserted the glorious hall of which they had been so proud.  Useless stood the best of dwellings, for none dared remain in it, but  every evening the Danes left it after their feast, and slept  elsewhere. This affliction endured for twelve years, and all that time  the beautiful hall of Heorot stood empty when darkness was upon it. By  night the dire fiend visited it in search of prey, and in the morning  his footsteps showed that his deadly enmity was not yet appeased, but  that any effort to use the hall at night would bring down his fatal  wrath on the careless sleepers.    Far and wide spread the tidings of this terrible oppression, and many  champions came from afar to offer King Hrothgar their aid, but none  was heroic enough to conquer the monster, and many a mighty warrior  lost his life in a vain struggle against Grendel. At length even these  bold adventurers ceased to come; Grendel remained master of Heorot,  and the Danes settled down in misery under the bondage of a perpetual  nightly terror, while Hrothgar grew old in helpless longing for  strength to rescue his people from their foe.      Beowulf    Meanwhile there had come to manhood and full strength a hero destined  to make his name famous for mighty deeds of valour throughout the  whole of the Teutonic North. In the realm of the Geats (Goetaland, in  the south of Sweden) ruled King Hygelac, a mighty ruler who was  ambitious enough to aim at conquering his neighbours on the mainland  of Germany. His only sister, daughter of the dead king Hrethel, had  married a great noble, Ecgtheow, and they had one son, Beowulf, who  from the age of seven was brought up at the Geatish court. The boy was  a lad of great stature and handsome appearance, with fair locks and  gallant bearing; but he greatly disappointed his grandfather, King  Hrethel, by his sluggish character. Beowulf as a youth had been  despised by all for his sloth and his unwarlike disposition; his  good-nature and his rarely stirred wrath made others look upon him  with scorn, and the mighty stature to which he grew brought him  nothing but scoffs and sneers and insults in the banquet-hall when the  royal feasts were held. Yet wise men might have seen the promise of  great strength in his powerful sinews and his mighty hands, and the  signs of great force of character in the glance of his clear blue eyes  and the fierceness of his anger when he was once aroused. At least  once already Beowulf had distinguished himself in a great feat--a  swimming-match with a famous champion, Breca, who had been beaten in  the contest. For this and other victories, and for the bodily strength  which gave Beowulf's hand-grip the force of thirty men, the hero was  already famed when the news of Grendel's ravages reached Geatland.  Beowulf, eager to try his strength against the monster, and burning to  add to his fame, asked and obtained permission from his uncle, King  Hygelac, to seek the stricken Danish king and offer his help against  Grendel; then, choosing fourteen loyal comrades and kinsfolk, he took  a cheerful farewell of the Geatish royal family and sailed for  Denmark.    Thus it happened that one day the Warden of the Coast, riding on his  round along the Danish shores, saw from the white cliffs a strange  war-vessel running in to shore. Her banners were unknown to him, her  crew were strangers and all in war-array, and as the Warden watched  them they ran the ship into a small creek among the mountainous  cliffs, made her fast to a rock with stout cables, and then landed and  put themselves in readiness for a march. Though there were fifteen of  the strangers and the Warden was alone, he showed no hesitation, but,  riding boldly down into their midst, loudly demanded:        \"What are ye warlike men    wielding bright weapons,      Wearing grey corslets    and boar-adorned helmets,      Who o'er the water-paths    come with your foaming keel      Ploughing the ocean surge?    I was appointed      Warden of Denmark's shores;    watch hold I by the wave      That on this Danish coast    no deadly enemy      Leading troops over sea    should land to injure.      None have here landed yet    more frankly coming      Than this fair company:    and yet ye answer not      The password of warriors,    and customs of kinsmen.      Ne'er have mine eyes beheld    a mightier warrior,      An earl more lordly, than    is he, the chief of you;      He is no common man;    if looks belie him not,      He is a hero bold,    worthily weaponed.      Anon must I know of you    kindred and country,      Lest ye as spies should go    free on our Danish soil.      Now ye men from afar,    sailing the surging sea,      Have heard my earnest thought:    best is a quick reply,      That I may swiftly know    whence ye have hither come.\"    So the aged Warden sat on his horse, gazing attentively on the faces  of the fifteen strangers, but watching most carefully the countenance  of the leader; for the mighty stature, the clear glance of command,  the goodly armour, and the lordly air of Beowulf left no doubt as to  who was the chieftain of that little band. When the questions had been  asked the leader of the new-comers moved forward till his mighty  figure stood beside the Warden's horse, and as he gazed up into the  old man's eyes he answered: \"We are warriors of the Geats, members of  King Hygelac's bodyguard. My father, well known among men of wisdom,  was named Ecgtheow, a wise counsellor who died full of years and  famous for his wisdom, leaving a memory dear to all good men.\"        \"We come to seek thy king    Healfdene's glorious son,      Thy nation's noble lord,    with friendly mind.      Be thou a guardian good    to us strangers here!      We have an errand grave    to the great Danish king,      Nor will I hidden hold    what I intend!      Thou canst tell if it is    truth (as we lately heard)      That some dire enemy,    deadly in evil deed,      Cometh in dark of night,    sateth his secret hate,      Worketh through fearsome awe,    slaughter and shame.      I can give Hrothgar bold    counsel to conquer him,      How he with valiant mind    Grendel may vanquish,      If he would ever lose    torment of burning care,      If bliss shall bloom again    and woe shall vanish.\"    The aged Warden replied: \"Every bold warrior of noble mind must  recognise the distinction between words and deeds. I judge by thy  speech that you are all friends to our Danish king; therefore I bid  you go forward, in warlike array, and I myself will guide you to King  Hrothgar; I will also bid my men draw your vessel up the beach, and  make her fast with a barricade of oars against any high tide. Safe she  shall be until again she bears you to your own land. May your  expedition prove successful.\"    Thus speaking, he turned his horse's head and led the way up the steep  cliff paths, while the Geats followed him, resplendent in shining  armour, with boar-crests on their helmets, shields and spears in their  hands, and mighty swords hanging in their belts: a goodly band were  they, as they strode boldly after the Warden. Anon there appeared a  roughly trodden path, which soon became a stone-paved road, and the  way led on to where the great hall, Heorot, towered aloft, gleaming  white in the sun; very glorious it seemed, with its pinnacled gables  and its carved beams and rafters, and the Geats gazed at it with  admiration as the Warden of the Coast said: \"Yonder stands our  monarch's hall, and your way lies clear before you. May the All-Father  keep you safe in the conflict! Now it is time for me to return; I go  to guard our shores from every foe.\"      Hrothgar and Beowulf    The little band of Geats, in their shining war-gear, strode along the  stone-paved street, their ring-mail sounding as they went, until they  reached the door of Heorot; and there, setting down their broad  shields and their keen spears against the wall, they prepared to enter  as peaceful guests the great hall of King Hrothgar. Wulfgar, one of  Hrothgar's nobles, met them at the door and asked whence such a  splendid band of warlike strangers, so well armed and so worthily  equipped, had come. Their heroic bearing betokened some noble  enterprise. Beowulf answered: \"We are Hygelac's chosen friends and  companions, and I am Beowulf. To King Hrothgar, thy master, will I  tell mine errand, if the son of Healfdene will allow us to approach  him.\"    Wulfgar, impressed by the words and bearing of the hero, replied: \"I  will announce thy coming to my lord, and bring back his answer\"; and  then made his way up the hall to the high seat where Hrothgar sat on  the dais amidst his bodyguard of picked champions. Bowing  respectfully, he said:        \"Here are come travelling    over the sea-expanse,      Journeying from afar,    heroes of Geatland.      Beowulf is the name    of their chief warrior.      This is their prayer, my lord,    that they may speak with thee;      Do not thou give them    a hasty refusal!      Do not deny them    the gladness of converse!      They in their war-gear seem    worthy of men's respect.      Noble their chieftain seems,    he who the warriors      Hither has guided.\"    At these words the aged king aroused himself from the sad reverie into  which he had fallen and answered: \"I knew him as a boy. Beowulf is the  son of Ecgtheow, who wedded the daughter of the Geat King Hrethel. His  fame has come hither before him; seafarers have told me that he has  the might of thirty men in his hand-grip. Great joy it is to know of  his coming, for he may save us from the terror of Grendel. If he  succeeds in this, great treasures will I bestow upon him. Hasten;  bring in hither Beowulf and his kindred thanes, and bid them welcome  to the Danish folk!\"    Wulfgar hurried down the hall to the place where Beowulf"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25529"],[0,"The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse (#5)"],[1,"all the day.      Dee-dee-chickadee!      Everybody's good to me!_\"    \"Hello, Tommy!\" said Peter Rabbit. \"Where'd you come from?\"    \"From Farmer Brown's new orchard up on the hill. It's a fine  orchard, Peter Rabbit, a fine orchard. I go there every morning  for my breakfast. If the winter lasts long enough, I'll have all  the trees cleaned up for Farmer Brown.\"    Peter looked puzzled. \"What do you mean?\" he asked.    \"Just what I say,\" replied Tommy Tit, almost turning a somersault  in the air. \"There's a million eggs of insects on those young  peach trees, but I'm clearing them all off as fast as I can.  They're mighty fine eating, Peter Rabbit, mighty fine eating!\"  And with that Tommy Tit had said good-by and flitted away.    Peter was thinking of that young orchard now, as he sat in the  moonlight trying to make up his mind where to go. The thought of  those young peach trees made his mouth water. It was a long way  up to the orchard on the hill, a very long way, and Peter was  wondering if it really was safe to go. He had just about made up  his mind to try it, for Peter is very, very fond of the bark of  young peach trees, when thump! something dropped out of the sky  at his very feet.    It startled Peter so that he nearly tumbled over backward. And  right at the same instant came the fierce, angry scream of Hooty  the Owl. That almost made Peter's heart stop beating, although he  knew that Hooty couldn't get him down there in the Old Briar-patch.  When Peter got his wits together and his heart didn't go so  jumpy, he looked to see what had dropped so close to him out of  the sky. His big eyes grew bigger than ever, and he rubbed them  to make quite sure that he really saw what he thought he saw.  Yes, there was no doubt about it--there at his feet lay Danny  Meadow Mouse!    [Illustration]                                       XII                The Old Briar-Patch Has a New Tenant      Danny Meadow Mouse slowly opened his eyes and then closed them  again quickly, as if afraid to look around. He could hear someone  talking. It was a pleasant voice, not at all like the terrible  voice of Hooty the Owl, which was the very last thing that Danny  Meadow Mouse could remember. Danny lay still a minute and  listened.    \"Why, Danny Meadow Mouse, where in the world did you drop from?\"  asked the voice. It sounded like--why, very much like Peter  Rabbit speaking. Danny opened his eyes again. It was Peter  Rabbit.    \"Where--where am I?\" asked Danny Meadow Mouse in a very weak and  small voice.    \"In the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch with me,\" replied  Peter Rabbit. \"But how did you get here? You seemed to drop right  out of the sky.\"    Danny Meadow Mouse shuddered. Suddenly he remembered everything:  how Hooty the Owl had caught him in great cruel claws and had  carried him through the moonlight across the snow-covered Green  Meadows; how he had felt Hooty's claws slip and then had  struggled and kicked and twisted and turned until his coat had  torn and he had dropped down, down, down, until he had landed in  the soft snow and knocked all the breath out of his little body.  The very last thing he could remember was Hooty's fierce scream  of rage and disappointment. Danny shuddered again.    Then a new thought came to him. He must get out of sight! Hooty  might catch him again! Danny tried to scramble to his feet.    \"Ouch! Oh!\" groaned Danny and lay still again.    \"There, there. Keep still, Danny Meadow Mouse. There's nothing to  be afraid of here,\" said Peter Rabbit gently. His big eyes filled  with tears as he looked at Danny Meadow Mouse, for Danny was all  torn and hurt by the cruel claws of Hooty the Owl, and you know  Peter has a very tender heart.    So Danny lay still, and while Peter Rabbit tried to make him  comfortable and dress his hurts, he told Peter all about how he  had forgotten to watch up in the sky and so had been caught by  Hooty the Owl, and all about his terrible ride in Hooty's cruel  claws.    \"Oh dear, whatever shall I do now?\" he ended. \"However shall I  get back home to my warm house of grass, my safe little tunnels  under the snow, and my little store of seeds in the snug hollow  in the old fence post?\"    Peter Rabbit looked thoughtful. \"You can't do it,\" said he. \"You  simply can't do it. It is such a long way for a little fellow  like you that it wouldn't be safe to try. If you went at night,  Hooty the Owl might catch you again. If you tried in daylight,  old Roughleg the Hawk would be almost sure to see you. And night  or day, old Granny Fox or Reddy Fox might come snooping around,  and if they did, they would be sure to catch you. I tell you  what, you stay right here! The dear Old Briar-patch is the safest  place in the world. Why, just think, here you can come out in  broad daylight and laugh at Granny and Reddy Fox and at old  Roughleg the Hawk, because the good old brambles will keep them  out if they try to get you. You can make just as good tunnels  under the snow here as you had there, and there are lots and lots  of seeds on the ground to eat. You know I don't care for them  myself. I'm lonesome sometimes, living here all alone. You stay  here, and we'll have the Old Briar-patch to ourselves.\"    [Illustration: _\"I tell you what, you stay right here!\" said  Peter_]    Danny Meadow Mouse looked at Peter gratefully. \"I will, and thank  you ever so much, Peter Rabbit,\" he said.    And this is how the dear Old Briar-patch happened to have another  tenant.                                      XIII                Peter Rabbit Visits the Peach Orchard      \"Don't go, Peter Rabbit! Don't go!\" begged Danny Meadow Mouse.    Peter hopped to the edge of the Old Briar-patch and looked over  the moonlit, snow-covered meadows to the hill back of Farmer  Brown's house. On that hill was the young peach orchard of which  Tommy Tit the Chickadee had told him, and ever since Peter's  mouth had watered and watered every time he thought of those  young peach trees and the tender bark on them.    \"I think I will, Danny, just this once,\" said Peter. \"It's a long  way, and I've never been there before; but I guess it's just as  safe as the Meadows or the Green Forest.\"        \"_Oh I'm as bold as bold can be!        Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!      I'll hie me forth the world to see!        Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!          My ears are long,          My legs are strong,          So now good day;          I'll hie away!        Sing hoppy-hippy-hippy-hop-o!_\"    And with that, Peter Rabbit left the dear, safe Old Briar-patch,  and away he went lipperty-lipperty-lip, across the Green Meadows  toward the hill and the young orchard back of Farmer Brown's  house.    Danny Meadow Mouse watched him go and shook his head in  disapproval. \"Foolish, foolish, foolish!\" he said over and over  to himself. \"Why can't Peter be content with the good things that  he has?\"    Peter Rabbit hurried along through the moonlight, stopping every  few minutes to sit up to look and listen. He heard the fierce  hunting call of Hooty the Owl way over in the Green Forest, so he  felt sure that at present there was nothing to fear from him. He  knew that since their return to the Green Meadows and the Green  Forest, Granny and Reddy Fox had kept away from Farmer Brown's,  so he did not worry about them.    All in good time Peter came to the young orchard. It was just as  Tommy Tit the Chickadee had told him. Peter hopped up to the  nearest peach tree and nibbled the bark. My, how good it tasted!  He went all around the tree, stripping off the bark. He stood up  on his long hind legs and reached as high as he could. Then he  dug the snow away and ate down as far as he could. When he could  get no more tender young bark, he went on to the next tree.    Now, though Peter didn't know it, he was in the very worst kind  of mischief. You see, when he took off all the bark all the way  around the young peach tree, he killed the tree, for you know it  is on the inside of the bark that the sap which gives life to a  tree and makes it grow goes up from the roots to all the  branches. So when Peter ate the bark all the way around the trunk  of the young tree, he had made it impossible for the sap to come  up in the spring. Oh, it was the worst kind of mischief that  Peter Rabbit was in.    But Peter didn't know it, and he kept right on filling that big  stomach of his and enjoying it so much that he forgot to watch  out for danger. Suddenly, just as he had begun on another tree, a  great roar right behind him made him jump almost out of his skin.  He knew that voice, and without waiting to even look behind him,  he started for the stone wall on the other side of the orchard.  Right at his heels, his great mouth wide open, was Bowser the  Hound.                                       XIV                      Farmer Brown Sets a Trap      Peter Rabbit was in trouble. He had got into mischief and now,  like everyone who gets into mischief, he wished that he hadn't.  The worst of it was that he was a long way from his home in the  dear Old Briar-patch, and he didn't know how he ever could get  back there again. Where was he? Why, in the stone wall on one  side of Farmer Brown's young peach orchard. How Peter blessed the  old stone wall in which he had found a safe hiding place! Bowser  had hung around nearly all night, so that Peter had not dared to  try to go home. Now it was daylight, and Peter knew it would not  be safe to put his nose outside.    Peter was worried, so worried that he couldn't go to sleep as he  usually does in the daytime. So he sat hidden in the old wall and  waited and watched. By and by he saw Farmer Brown and Farmer  Brown's boy come out into the orchard. Right away they saw the  mischief which Peter had done, and he could tell by the sound of  their voices that they were very, very angry. They went away, but  before long they were back again, and all day long Peter watched  them work putting"]]]
