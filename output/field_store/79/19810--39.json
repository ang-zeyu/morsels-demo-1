We repudiate it; and in plain, but decorous  language,--truth is always decorous,--we purpose to divulge those  secrets hidden hitherto under the technical jargon of science.      THE DISTINCTION OF THE SEXES.    The distinction of the sexes belongs neither to the highest nor to the  lowest forms of existence. Animals and vegetables of the humblest  character have no sex. So it is with spirits. Revelation implies that  beyond this life sexual characteristics cease. On one occasion the  Sadducees put this question to Christ: There was a woman who lawfully  had seven husbands, one after the other; now, at the resurrection, which  of these shall be her husband? or shall they all have her to wife? He  replied that hereafter there shall be neither marrying nor giving in  marriage, but that all shall be 'as the angels which are in heaven.'  Sexuality implies reproduction, and that is something we do not  associate with spiritual life.    It further implies imperfection, which is equally far from our hopes of  happiness beyond the grave. The polyp, which reproduces by a division of  itself, is in one sense more complete than we are. The man is in some  respects inferior to the woman; the woman in others is subordinate to  man. A happy marriage, a perfect union, they twain one flesh, is the  type of the independent, completed being. Without the other, either is  defective. 'Marriage,' said Napoleon, 'is strictly indispensable to  happiness.'    There is, in fact, a less difference between the sexes than is generally  believed. They are but slight variations from one original plan.  Anatomists maintain, with plausible arguments, that there is no part or  organ in the one sex but has an analogous part or organ in the other,  similar in structure, similar in position. Just as the right side  resembles the left, so does man resemble woman.    Let us see what differences there really are:    The frame of woman is shorter and slighter. In the United States the men  average five feet eight inches in height, and one hundred and forty-five  pounds in weight; the women, five feet two and a half inches in height,  and one hundred and twenty-five pounds in weight. Man has broad  shoulders and narrow hips; woman has narrow shoulders and broad hips.  Her skull is formed of thinner bones, and is in shape more like that of  a child. Its capacity, in proportion to her height, is very little less  than in man,--about one-fiftieth, it is said,--which, so far as  brain-power is concerned, may readily be made up by its finer texture.  Her shoulders are set farther back than in the other sex, giving her  greater breadth of chest in front. This is brought about by the  increased length of her collar-bone; and this is the reason why she can  never throw a ball or stone with the accuracy of a man. Graceful in  other exercises, here she is awkward.    Her contour is more rounded, her neck is longer, her skin smoother, her  voice softer, her hair less generally distributed over the body, but  stronger in growth than in man. She breathes with the muscles of her  chest--he with those of his abdomen. He has greater muscular force--she  more power of endurance. Beyond all else she has the attributes of  maternity,--she is provided with organs to nourish and protect the child  before and after birth.      PERSONS OF BOTH SEXES AND OF NEITHER SEX.    Nature is very sedulous in maintaining these differences. It is the  rarest thing in the world to find a human being of doubtful sex. Many a  physician disbelieves that there ever has been a person of both sexes--a  true hermaphrodite. They are very scarce, but they do exist. There is  one now living in Germany. It bears a female name, Catherine Hohmann.  She was baptised and brought up a female; but Catherine is as much man  as woman. The learned professor of anatomy, Rokitansky, of Vienna,  asserts most positively that this is a real hermaphrodite. Her history  is sad. Born in humble circumstances, when of marriageable age she loved  a man, who wished her to emigrate with him to America. But when she  disclosed to him her deformity, he broke off the engagement and deserted  her. Then her affection became fixed on a young girl; but how could she  make her suit to one apparently of her own sex? With passions that  prompt her to seek both sexes, she belongs to neither. 'What shall I do  here on earth?' she exclaimed, in tears, to a man of science who  recently visited her. 'What am I? In my life an object of scientific  experiment, and after my death an anatomical curiosity.'    There are also persons--very few indeed--who have no sex at all. They  are without organs and without passions. Such creatures seem to have  been formed merely to show us that this much-talked-of difference of sex  is, after all, nothing inherent in the constitution of things, and that  individuals may be born, live and thrive, of both sexes, or of neither.      THE SPHERE OF WOMAN.    Our province lies within the physical sphere of woman. But we will here  allow ourselves a momentary digression. It will be seen that while these  differences are not radical, yet they are peculiarly permanent. They  hint to us the mental and intellectual character of woman. What opinion  should we hold on this much-vexed question?    To this effect: The mental faculties of man and woman are unlike, but  not unequal. Any argument to the contrary, drawn from the somewhat less  weight of the brain of woman, is met by the fact that the most able men  are often undersized, with small heads. The subordinate place which  woman occupies in most states, arises partly from the fact that the part  she plays in reproduction prevents her from devoting her whole time and  energies to the acquisition of power, and partly from the fact that  those faculties in which she is superior to man have been obscured and  oppressed by the animal vigor and selfishness of the male. As  civilisation advances, the natural rights of woman will be more and more  freely conceded, until the sexes become absolutely equal before the law;  and, finally, her superiority in many respects will be granted, and she  will reap the benefits of all the advantages it brings, without desiring  to encroach on those avocations for which masculine energy and strength  are imperatively needed.    The most peculiar features of woman's life are hers for a limited period  only. Man is man for a longer time than woman is woman. With him it is a  lifetime matter; with her it is but for a score of years or so. Her  child-bearing period is less than half her life. Within this time she  passes through all the phases of that experience which is peculiarly her  own.    And these phases, what are they? Nature herself defines them. They are  three in number,--the Maiden, the Wife, and the Mother. In one and then  another of this triad, her life passes. Each has its own duties and  dangers; each demands its own precautions; each must be studied by  itself.    Let us at once commence this important study, and proceed in the order  of time.          THE MAIDEN.      _PUBERTY._    At a certain period in the life of the female, she ceases to be a girl,  and becomes a _woman_. Hitherto she has felt no distinction between  herself and the boys, her playmates. But now a crisis takes place, which  is for ever after to hedge her round with a mysterious, invisible, but  most real barrier from all _man_kind.    This period is called _the age of puberty_. Its sign is a flow of blood  recurring every month; its meaning, that the female has entered upon  that portion of her life whose peculiar obligations are to the whole  race--no longer to herself alone. The second part of her twofold nature  is opened. Why is it that on her, the weaker sex, this extra burden is  laid? Why this weakness, these pains, this recurring loss of vital  fluid?    Perhaps, as has been observed, it is a wise provision that she is thus  reminded of her lowly duty, lest man should make her the sole object of  his worship, or lest the pride of beauty should obscure the sense of  shame. But this question concerns rather the moralist than the  physician, and we cease asking _why_ it is, and shall only inquire  _what_ it is.    To this science returns a clear reply. In the anatomy of woman there are  two small bodies, in shape and size like large almonds, called the  ovaries. They lie one on each side of the womb, and are connected with  it by tubes about four inches in length. These bodies are solid, but  contain a great number of diminutive vesicles, which, by some mysterious  law of nature, mature one at a time, every thirty days, for thirty years  of woman's life. When mature, the vesicle separates from the ovary,  traverses the tube into the womb, and is thence expelled and lost, or  becomes, by contact with the other sex, the germ of a living being. This  process is accompanied by a disturbance of the whole system. Wandering  pains are felt; a sense of languor steals over the mind; the blood  rushes with increased violence through the vessels, and more or less of  it escapes from the veins, causing that change which we term  _menstruation._    The ancients had a tradition that in the beginning of things the world  was made from an egg; the naturalists of past generations had this  maxim: Everything living comes from an egg; and science to-day says the  same. For this vesicle we have mentioned is in fact an _egg_, similar in  structure to those which birds, fish, and turtles deposit. The only  differences are, that the one is developed out of the body, the other  within; the one has a shell, the other has none.    Therefore physiologists give this definition: Menstruation is  ovulation,--it is the laying of an egg.      WHAT IS THE AGE OF PUBERTY?    This has been a matter of careful study by physicians. They have  collected great numbers of observations,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#5)"],[1,"Pastor, who was my mother's confessor. The  book was presented to him for destruction.    \"It's a bad book,\" the Monsignore said. \"I hope you didn't talk about  any of these stories to the other boys in school?\"    \"Oh, no,\" I said; \"if I did, they would say much worse things, and I  would probably have to tell them in confession. Besides,\" I added, \"all  the people in the Boccaccio book were good Catholics, I suppose, as they  were Italians, and I think, after all, when they caught the plague, they  died good deaths.\"    The Pastor looked puzzled, took the book, and gave me his blessing and  dismissed me. And my mother seemed to think that I was sufficiently  exorcised.    After this the books I read were more carefully considered. I was given  the \"Tales of Canon Schmidt\"--dear little stories of German children in  the Black Forest, with strange little wood-cuts, which went very well  with another volume I found at this time called \"Jack Halifax,\" not  \"John Halifax, Gentleman,\" which my mother had already read to me--but a  curious little tome long out of print. And then there sailed upon my  vision a long procession of the works of the Flemish novelist, Hendrik  Conscience, whose \"Lion of Flanders\" opened a new world of romance, and  there were \"Wooden Clara,\" and other pieces which made one feel as if  one lived in Flanders.    Just about this time I read in Littell's _Living Age_ a novel called  \"The Amber Witch,\" and some of Fritz Reuter's Low German stories; but  these were all effaced by \"The Quaker Soldier.\" This may not have been  much of a novel. I did not put it to the touch of comparison with \"The  Virginians\" or \"Esmond.\" They were what my father called  \"classics\"--things superior and apart; but \"The Quaker Soldier\" was  quite good enough for me. It opened a new view of American Revolutionary  history, and then it was redolent of the country of Pennsylvania. I  recall now the incident of the Pennsylvania Dutch housewife's using her  thumb to spread the butter on the bread for the hungry soldier. This is  all that I can recall of those delectable pages. But, later, neither  Henry Peterson's \"Pemberton\" nor Dr. Weir Mitchell's \"Hugh Wynne\" seemed  to have the glory and the fascination of the long-lost \"Quaker Soldier.\"    After this, I fell under the spell of the French Revolution through a  book, given to me by my mother, about _la Vend['e]e_. It was a dull book,  but nothing, not even a bad translation, could dim the heroism of Henri  de la Rochejaquelein for me, and I became a Royalist of the Royalists,  and held hotly the thesis that if George Washington had returned the  compliment of going over to France in '89, he would have done Lafayette  a great service by restoring the good Louis XVI. and the beautiful Marie  Antoinette!    When I had reached the age of seventeen I had developed, as the result  of my reading, a great belief in all lost causes. I had become  exceedingly devoted to the cause of Ireland as the kindly Pastor had  sent me a copy of \"Willy Reilly and His Colleen Bawn,\" perhaps as an  antidote to the lingering effects of \"Boccaccio.\" I was rather troubled  to find so many \"swear words\" in it, but I made all the allowances that  a real lover of literature is often compelled to make!      _The Bible_    The glimpses I had of the Bible, some of which rather prejudiced me, as  a moral child, against the Sacred Book, were, however, of inestimable  value. Of course the New Testament was always open to me, and I read it  constantly as a pleasure. The language, both in the Douai version and  the King James version, was often very obscure. Although I soon learned  to recognize the beauty of the 23rd Psalm in the King James  version--which I always read when I went to one of my cousins--I found  the sonorous Latinisms of the Douai version interesting. For a time I  was limited to a book of Bible stories given us to read at school, as it  was considered unwise to permit children to read the Old Testament  unexpurgated. After a while, however, the embargo seemed to be raised  for some reason or other, and again I was allowed to revel with a great  deal of profit in the wonderful poems, prophecies, and histories of the  Old Testament. I soon discovered that it was impossible to understand  the allusions in English literature without a knowledge of the Bible.  What would \"Ruth among the alien corn\" mean to a reader who had never  known the beauty of the story of Ruth? And the lilies of the field,  permeating all poetical literature, would have lost all their perfume if  one knew nothing about the Song of Solomon.    Putting aside the question as to whether young readers should be let  loose in the Old Testament or not, or whether modern ideas of purity are  justified in including ignorance as the supremest virtue, he who does  not make himself familiar with Biblical ideas and phraseology finds  himself in after-life with an incomplete medium of expression. It used  to be said of the typical English gentleman that all he needed to know  was to ride after the hounds and to construe Horace. This is not so  absurd, after all, as it appears to be to most moderns. To construe  Horace, of course, meant that he should have at least a speaking  acquaintance with one of the masterpieces of Roman literature, and this  knowledge gave him a grip on the universal speech of all cultivated  people. However useless his allusions to Chlo[:e] and to Maecenas were in  the business of practical life, he was at least able to understand what  they meant, and even a slight acquaintance with the Latins stamped him  as speaking the speech of a gentleman.    Similarly, a man who knows the Scriptures is fitted with allusions that  clarify and illuminate the ordinary speech. He may not have any  technical knowledge, or his technical knowledge may be so great as to  debar him from meeting other men in conversation on equal grounds; but  his reading of the Bible gives his speech or writing a background, a  colour, a metaphorical strength, which illuminate even the commonplace.  Strike the Bible from the sphere of any man's experience and he is in a  measure left out of much of that conversation which helps to make life  endurable.    Pagan mythology is rather out of fashion. Even the poets often now  assume that Clytie is a name that requires an explanation and that  Daphne and her flight through the laurel do not bring up immediate  memories of Syrinx and the reeds. The Dictionary of Lampri[`e]re is covered  with dust; and one may quote an episode from Ovid without an answering  glance of comprehension from the hearer. This does not imply ignorance;  it is only that, in the modern system, the old mythology is not taken  very seriously.    Since Latin and Greek have almost ceased to be a necessary part of a  gentleman's education, there is no class of allusions from which we can  draw to lighten or strengthen ordinary speech unless we turn to the  Bible. This deprives conversation of much of its colour and renders it  rather commonplace and meagre. Unfortunately, among many of our young  people, the Bible seems to be a book to be avoided or to be treated in a  rather \"jocose\" manner. To raise a laugh on the vaudeville stage, a  Biblical quotation has only to be produced, and the weary comedian, when  he is at a loss to get a witty speech across the footlights, is almost  sure to speak of Jonah and the whale!    It is disappointing to notice this gradual change that has taken place  in the attitude of the younger generation toward the Sacred Book. The  Sunday Schools, in their attempt to make the genealogies of importance  and to overload the memories of their little disciples with a multitude  of texts, or to over-explain every allusion in the terms of physical  geography, etc., may in a measure be responsible for this, but they  cannot be entirely responsible. One must admit that diversities of  interpretations of the Sacred Scriptures from a religious point of view  will always be an obstacle to their use in schools where the children of  Jews, of Mohammedans, and of the various Christian denominations  assemble. But there is always the home, where the first impetus to a  satisfactory knowledge of the Sacred Book ought to be given. The decay  of the practice of reading aloud in our homes is very evident in the  lack of real culture--or, rather, rudiments of real culture--in our  children. But there is no use in declaiming against this. Other times,  other manners; accusatory declamation is simply a luxury of Old Age!    Personally, my desultory reading of the Old and the New Testaments gave  me a background against which I could see the trend of the books I  devoured more clearly; it added immensely to my enjoyment of them;  besides, it was a moral and ethical safeguard. It was easy even for a  boy to discover that the morality of the New Testament was the standard  by which not only life, but literature, which is the finest expression  of life, should be judged. If there are great declamations, declamations  full of dramatic fire, which nearly every boy at school learns to love,  in the Old Testament, there are the most moving, tender, and simple  stories in the New. To the uncorrupted mind, to the unjaded mind, which  has not been forced to look on books as mere recitals of exciting  adventures, the Acts of the Apostles are full of entrancing episodes. It  is very easy for a receptive youth to acquire a taste for St. Paul, and  I soon learned that St. Paul was not only one of the greatest of letter  writers, but as a figure of history more interesting than Julius Caesar,  and certainly more modern. Young people delight in human documents. They  may not know why they delight in these documents, but it is because of  their humanity. Now who can be more human than St. Paul? And the more  you read his epistles, and the more you know of his life, the more human  he becomes. He knew how to be angry and sin not, and the"]]]
