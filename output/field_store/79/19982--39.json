[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29691"],[0,"Taxidermy (#5)"],[1," bone wiring is completed take up again the body sketches. Bring  out a quantity of fine excelsior for replacing the leg muscles and skull  meat and for filling the body after assembling the wired parts within  the skin.    In wrapping on the artificial leg muscles begin at the feet. Follow the  outline sketches and with thread and small cord wrap small, properly  proportioned masses, squeezed firm in the hand or finger tips, upon the  bones, copying Nature's outline and form accurately.    Wrap the foreleg to the shoulders. Complete the hind leg to the knee and  above this point wrap on only the muscles on top of the thigh bone,  leaving back of thigh to be filled with loose material when the skin is  adjusted.    The tail may be made of cotton, wrapped tightly and smoothly upon the  wire, wisp by wisp. Begin at tip and work down, spinning the wire with  right hand to produce uniformity of shape. If mammal is larger than a  squirrel the tail may be made of tow, pulled smooth, laid lengthwise of  the wire, and wrapped smoothly down with thread. For size, length, and  shape of tail, refer to the sketches.    The head muscles may be replaced in much the same manner as leg muscles.  (See Fig. 18 for wrapping complete.) The specimen is now ready to  assemble.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    To accomplish this in systematic order, insert the head into place and  next the forelegs. Consult sketch and bend a right angle in  foreleg-wire back of shoulder at such a point that shoulder will set in  proper relation to head. One at a time, using the pliers, twist these  foreleg-wire ends, after setting them through shoulder loop, tightly  back along the body-wire. Next insert the hind legs into the skin. Slip  their wires through hip loops, carry them forward, and tightly twist  them around body-wire as in forelegs.    If the tail skin was unopened except at tip the wrapped tail should be  put in when the head is placed in the skin. If tail skin was opened full  length, the artificial tail may be placed after all the legs are  adjusted. Run tail-wire base forward through its pelvis-wire loop and  twist it around body-wire. (For general assembling of specimen see Fig.  19.)    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    Before filling the body, sew up the tail, using short stitches and a  round needle, if it is possible to push it through skin easily. Begin  sewing at tip and work toward body. Finish all sewing with a simple knot  drawn tight under tip of finger.    Next, with a stuffing rod of appropriate size, place the neck filling,  stuffing against palm of left hand hollowed outside the skin at point of  filling so that the forming may be felt accurately.    Then comes the filling for shoulder blades over forelegs and with it the  chest filling. In handling the excelsior, pull out wisps of it from the  mass and rub them between the palms so that the fiber is broken up and  softened. Fine excelsior (\"wood wool\") is the material par excellence  for stuffing the bodies of small mammals from size of small chipmunks  up. Mice require a softer material, and short chopped, fine tow answers  requirements in them. The leg bones of mice may be wrapped with long  fiber cotton batting or fine tow.    When the shoulders and chest have been filled firm full, but not to the  point of looking stuffed, turn to the hind legs and pelvis. Fill in the  back thigh muscles neatly; then cover top of wire pelvis, pushing  material well down to base of tail. Fill rump sufficiently to overcome  a pinched or too high set look. The position must be considered in  properly filling the back, sides, and abdomen. If a bunched up position  is to be worked out, bend the wire back bone into semipose and place the  legs in approximately their final position. After this, fill the body to  suit the position, always forming with the stuffing rod working against  the left hand. See that all filling is firm but not packed in to the  point of distorting the skin. Consult sketches and aim to preserve the  little animal's natural form. (For general filling details see Fig. 20)    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    When the filling is all placed, sew the abdominal incision neatly up,  beginning at rear end always and going forward. Wax the thread. In a  hunched together position, middling long stitches may be used. In a  straighter pose shorter stitches should be used.    Now, when the body is sewn up cover the specimen with paper and a damp  cloth to prevent drying while a small batch of compo. No. II is prepared  for finishing feet and head. Returning to the specimen with this,  slightly moisten the wrapping on the bones of the feet and apply a bit  of the compo. at front and in the sole of each foot. This cements the  toes to the foot and fills the pads.    After this is done sew each foot up neatly, beginning at toes and  working toward body. If toes were large and required splitting and  removing of toe cords, replace the cords with bits of small rope or soft  twine and sew toes up neatly with short stitches. It is best to use a  round needle and black thread, well waxed for this work.    The specimen is now ready to place upon its base, perch, or stand. With  the approximate position shaped, mark the perch for wire holes by  holding specimen over it and indicating places where wires come, by  scratch or pencil mark. When holes are drilled and the specimen wired  into place, take a strong fur needle set into a handle and by working  and compressing with the fingers and jab-lifting with the needle,  finish shaping and positioning.    Hold in hollow of flanks by sewing through here with long needle and  strong cord, heavily knotted for the first hold. Finish this sewing with  a knot drawn down into the fur under the thumb. Arrange the fur over all  stitches by picking it free with tweezers.    With the body finished, take up filling and finishing the head with the  compo. First work compo. into the ears and pinch them out thin and into  their natural shape, then cover the entire face under the skin with  compo. Fill eye sockets and set eyes as second step. Lastly fill the  nose and lips and model them firmly upon the jaws. In all mammals cover  the teeth well with the lips. Even in a muskrat the teeth do not  ordinarily show at all. Also avoid getting the lips, nose, and whisker  base too full. Set the tail into easy normal position, pin toes to grasp  the perch or set well upon the ground and inspect the body to see that  no hollow or bumps remain in the filling where there should be perfect  smoothness. Remove such of these as persist with the handle-held fur  needle and then set the specimen in a well ventilated place to dry.    The principal point in preparing thin or stretchy small mammal skins  for mounting is to leave the membrane of skin-muscles on the body skin.  This holds a flabby skin in shape and lends strength to a frail one. In  spite of this the legs of most wild rabbits must be handled very  gingerly, as they have no lining membrane like the body. For finishing  mouth, nose, and eyelids of mounted mammals, melt a little refined  beeswax in a metal vessel. While the wax is hot (don't allow it to  smoke), stir in a little tube oil color (black or brown for most  mammals; color to nature for birds with highly tinted eyelids). Mix the  wax and color thoroughly with a flat bristle brush. Afterward the brush  may be easily cleaned of the wax by breaking it up with alcohol, when it  has cooled.    Next draw some wisps of fine, long-fiber cotton through the melted wax  and lay them quickly flat upon oiled paper to cool. For lips of mammals  cut narrow strips of the wax. Heat an upholstering spindle and with it  repeatedly heated, melt the wax and cotton into crease of closed lips.  Melt thin, flat pieces of the wax into depth of nostrils and very narrow  strips in eyelids.    When all the wax is placed, model it into shape with a smooth,  wedge-ended bit of pine wood. To clean out wax that ran into the hair  by melting, apply alcohol with a bit of cloth, scratch the waxy hair  loose with finger nail and rub the crumbled wax out with the bit of  alcohol dampened cloth. This leaves lips, eyelids, and nostrils neatly  finished. Apply thin varnish to nose, edge of eyelids, and bare parts of  lips that show. For mounting a mammal with open mouth, follow same note  given in making a whole head for rug.    To make a small mammal cabinet skin, remove the skin as for mounting  except that legs are severed at elbow and knee and soles of feet are  split only to allow of poisoning.    Poison with dry arsenic. Wire tail same as in mounting. Wrap leg bones  with cotton, tow, or excelsior according to size of specimen. Turn the  skin back over a core of one of these materials, wrapped upon a splinter  or stick, to size of natural body, but somewhat flatter. Sew up  abdominal incision neatly. Catch the lips together with two or three  stitches. Lay specimen, belly down, upon a soft-wood board. Pin fore  paws alongside of the face and hind feet alongside of tail.    When this is done press specimen until it is slightly flattened and set  aside to dry. With each specimen preserve the perfect skull when  possible, date on which taken, locality, any note of interest observed  at the time (and add collector's name).    In using dry arsenic, apply with a small brush, using no grease on the  hands.          PREPARING AND MOUNTING GAME FISHES AND SMALL REPTILES          CHAPTER IV    PREPARING AND MOUNTING GAME FISHES AND SMALL REPTILES      For the purpose of mounting, fishes and reptiles must be fresh, and the  fresher the better. In beginning this chapter it may be well to state a  simple way to keep fish for a short period before skinning and mounting,  as sportsmen afield will not always be able immediately to prepare  specimens taken.    First, while the fish is perfectly fresh, remove the viscera.

Or, perhaps, could he  afford to stop at the \"Fortunata\" Hotel, centrally located?    There are, too, the boorish hayseeds from out of town trying to sell  their produce, unaccustomed to the fashionable Latin-Greek speech of  the city folks, gaping with their mouths wide open, greedily at the  steaks of sacrificial meat displayed behind enlarging glasses in the  cheap cook shop windows. There they giggle and chuckle, those wily  landlords with their blase habitues and their underlings, the greasy  cooks, the roguish \"good mixers\" at the bar and the winsome if  resolute _copae_--waitresses--all ready to go, to do business. So  slippery are the cooks that Plautus calls one _Congrio_--sea eel--so  black that another deserves the title _Anthrax_--coal.    There they are, one and all, the characters necessary to make up what  we call civilization, chattering agitatedly in a lingo of  Latin-Greek-Oscan--as if life were a continuous market day.    It takes no particular scholarship, only a little imagination and  human sympathy to see and to hear the ghosts of Pompeii.    There is no pose about this town, no _mise-en-scene_, no  stage-setting. No heroic gesture. No theatricals, in short, no lies.  There is to be found no shred of that vainglorious cloak which humans  will deftly drape about their shoulders whenever they happen to be  aware of the camera. There is no \"registering\" of any kind here.    Pompeii's natural and pleasant disposition, therefore, is ever so much  more in evidence. Not a single one of this charming city's movements  was intended for posterity. Her life stands before our eyes in clear  reality, in naked, unadorned truth. Indeed, there were many things  that the good folks would have loved to point to with pride. You have  to search for these now. There are, alas and alack, a few things they  would have hidden, had they only known what was in store for them. But  all these things, good, indifferent and bad, remained in their places;  and here they are, unsuspecting, real, natural, charming like Diana  and her wood nymphs.    Were it not quite superfluous, we would urgently recommend the study  of Pompeii to the students of life in general and to those of  Antiquity in particular. Those who would know something about the  ancient table cannot do without Pompeii.      THREE ANCIENT WRITERS: ANACHARSIS, APICIUS, PETRONIUS    To those who lay stress upon documentary evidence or literary  testimony, to those trusting implicitly in the honesty and reliability  of writers of fiction, we would recommend Petronius Arbiter.    His _cena Trimalchionis_, Trimalchio's dinner, is the sole surviving  piece from the pen of a Roman contemporary, giving detailed  information on our subject. It is, too, the work of a great writer  moving in the best circles, and, therefore, so much more desirable as  an expert. Petronius deserves to be quoted in full but his work is too  well-known, and our space too short. However, right here we wish to  warn the student to bear in mind in perusing Petronius that this  writer, in his _cena_, is not depicting a meal but that he is  satirizing a man--that makes all the difference in the world as far  as we are concerned. Petronius' _cena_ is plainly an exaggeration, but  even from its distorted contours the student may recognize the true  lines of an ancient meal.    There is, not so well-known a beautiful picture of an Athenian dinner  party which must not be overlooked, for it contains a wealth of  information. Although Greek, we learn from it much of the Roman  conditions. Anacharsis' description of a banquet at Athens, dating  back to the fourth century B.C. about the time when the Periclean  regime flourished, is worth your perusal. A particularly good version  of this tale is rendered by Baron Vaerst in his book \"Gastrosophie,\"  Leipzig, 1854, who has based his version on the original translation  from the Greek, entitled, _Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Grece vers le  milieu du quatrieme siecle avant l'ere vulgaire par J. J. Barthelemy_,  Paris, 1824. Vaerst has amplified the excerpts from the young  traveler's observations by quotations from other ancient Greek writers  upon the subject, thus giving us a most beautiful and authentic ideal  description of Greek table manners and habits when Athens had reached  the height in culture, refinement and political greatness.    Anacharsis was not a Hellene but a Scythian visitor. By his own  admission he is no authority on Grecian cookery, but as a reporter he  excels.    This truly Hellenic discussion of the art of eating and living at the  table of the cultured Athenians is the most profound discourse we know  of, ancient or modern, on eating. The wisdom revealed in this tale is  lasting, and, like Greek marble, consummate in external beauty and  inner worth.    We thus possess the testimony of two contemporary writers which  together with the book of Apicius and with what we learn from  Athenaeus should give a fair picture of ancient eating and cookery.    Apicius is our most substantial witness.    Unfortunately, this source has not been spared by meddlesome men, and  it has not reached us in its pristine condition. As a matter of fact,  Apicius has been badly mauled throughout the centuries. This book has  always attracted attention, never has it met with indifference. In the  middle ages it became the object of intensive study, interpretation,  controversy--in short it has attracted interest that has lasted into  modern times.    When, with the advent of the dark ages, it ceased to be a practical  cookery book, it became a treasure cherished by the few who preserved  the classical literature, and after the invention of printing it  became the object of curiosity, even mystery. Some interpreters waxed  enthusiastic over it, others who failed to understand it, condemned it  as hopeless and worthless.    The pages of our Apiciana plainly show the lasting interest in our  ancient book, particularly ever since its presence became a matter of  common knowledge during the first century of printing.    The Apicius book is the most ancient of European cookery books.  However, Platina's work, _de honesta uolvptate_, is the first cookery  book to appear in print. Platina, in 1474, was more up-to-date. His  book had a larger circulation. But its vogue stopped after a century  while Apicius marched on through centuries to come, tantalizing the  scholars, amusing the curious gourmets if not educated cooks to the  present day.      APICIUS, THE MAN    Who was Apicius? This is the surname of several renowned gastronomers  of old Rome. There are many references and anecdotes in ancient  literature to men bearing this name. Two Apicii have definitely been  accounted for. The older one, Marcus A. lived at the time of Sulla  about 100 B.C. The man we are most interested in, M. Gabius Apicius,  lived under Augustus and Tiberius, 80 B.C. to A.D. 40. However, both  these men had a reputation for their good table.      ATHENAEUS ON APICIUS    It is worth noting that the well-read Athenaeus, conversant with most  authors of Antiquity makes no mention of the Apicius book. This  collection of recipes, then, was not in general circulation during  Athenaei time (beginning of the third century of our era), that,  maybe, it was kept a secret by some Roman cooks. On the other hand it  is possible that the Apicius book did not exist during the time of  Athenaeus in the form handed down to us and that the monographs on  various departments of cookery (most of them of Greek origin, works of  which indeed Athenaeus speaks) were collected after the first quarter  of the third century and were adorned with the name of Apicius merely  because his fame as a gourmet had endured.    What Athenaeus knows about Apicius (one of three known famous eaters  bearing that name) is the following:        \"About the time of Tiberius [42 B.C.-37 A.D.] there      lived a man, named Apicius; very rich and luxurious, for      whom several kinds of cheesecake called Apician, are      named [not found in our present A.]. He spent myriads of      drachmas on his belly, living chiefly at Minturnae, a      city of Campania, eating very expensive crawfish, which      are found in that place superior in size to those of      Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing,      too, that they were very large in Africa, he sailed      thither, without waiting a single day, and suffered      exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the      coast, before he disembarked (for his arrival made a      great stir among the Africans) the fishermen came      alongside in their boats and brought him some very fine      crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had      any finer; and when they said that there were none finer      than those which they had brought, he, recollecting      those at Minturnae ordered the master of the ship to sail      back the same way into Italy, without going near the      land....        \"When the emperor Trajan [A.D. 52 or 53-117] was in      Parthia [a country in Asia, part of Persia?] at a      distance of many days from the sea, Apicius sent him      fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever      contrivance of his own; real oysters....\"    (The instructions given in our Apicius book, Recipe 14, for the  keeping of oysters would hardly guarantee their safe arrival on such  a journey as described above.)    Athenaeus tells us further that many of the Apician recipes were  famous and that many dishes were named after him. This confirms the  theory that"]]]
