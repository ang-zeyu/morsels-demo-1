Therefore, before the year was out,  he chose a second confessor, Pere Denys, a Franciscan, consulting both  alternately, and confiding his conscientious scruples to them. Every  penance appeared too easy, and he added to those enjoined by his  directors continual mortifications of his own devising, so that even  Tartufe himself would have owned his superiority.    He wore about him two shrouds, to which were fastened relics of Madame  de Chantal, also a medal of St. Francois de Saps, and occasionally  scourged himself. His mistress related that he had begged her to take a  sitting at the church of St. Nicholas, in order that he might more  easily attend service when he had a day out, and had brought her a small  sum which he had saved, to pay half the expense.    Moreover, he had slept upon straw during the whole of Lent, and took  care that Madame Legrand heard of this through the servant, pretending  at first to hide it as if it were something wrong. He tried to prevent  the maid from going into his room, and when she found out the straw he  forbade her to mention it--which naturally made her more anxious to  relate her discovery. Such a piece of piety, combined with such  meritorious humility, such dread of publicity, could only increase the  excellent opinion which everyone already had of him.    Every day was marked by some fresh hypocrisy. One of his sisters, a  novice in the convent of the Ladies of the Visitation of the Virgin, was  to take the veil at Easter. Derues obtained permission to be present at  the ceremony, and was to start on foot on Good Friday. When he departed,  the shop happened to be full of people, and the gossips of the  neighbourhood inquired where he was going. Madame Legrand desired him to  have a glass of liqueur (wine he never touched) and something to eat  before starting.    \"Oh, madame!\" he exclaimed, \"do you think I could eat on a day like  this, the day on which Christ was crucified! I will take a piece of  bread with me, but I shall only eat it at the inn where I intend to  sleep: I mean to fast the whole way.\"    But this kind of thing was not sufficient. He wanted an opportunity to  establish a reputation for honesty on a firm basis. Chance provided one,  and he seized it immediately, although at the expense of a member of his  own family.    One of his brothers, who kept a public-house at Chartres, came to see  him. Derues, under pretence of showing him the sights of Paris, which he  did not know, asked his mistress to allow him to take in the brother for  a few days, which she granted. The last evening of his stay, Derues went  up to his room, broke open the box which contained his clothes, turned  over everything it contained, examined the clothes, and discovering two  new cotton nightcaps, raised a cry which brought up the household. His  brother just then returned, and Derues called him an infamous thief,  declaring that he had stolen the money for these new articles out of the  shop the evening before. His brother defended himself, protesting his  innocence, and, indignant at such incomprehensible treachery,  endeavoured to turn the tables by relating some of Antoine's early  misdeeds. The latter, however, stopped him, by declaring on his honour  that he had seen his brother the evening before go to the till, slip his  hand in, and take out some money. The brother was confounded and  silenced by so audacious a lie; he hesitated, stammered, and was turned  out of the house. Derues worthily crowned this piece of iniquity by  obliging his mistress to accept the restitution of the stolen money. It  cost him three livres, twelve sons, but the interest it brought him was  the power of stealing unsuspected. That evening he spent in prayer for  the pardon of his brother's supposed guilt.    All these schemes had succeeded, and brought him nearer to the desired  goal, for not a soul in the quarter ventured to doubt the word of this  saintly individual. His fawning manners and insinuating language varied  according to the people addressed. He adapted himself to all,  contradicting no one, and, while austere himself, he flattered the  tastes of others. In the various houses where he visited his  conversation was serious, grave, and sententious; and, as we have seen,  he could quote Scripture with the readiness of a theologian. In the  shop, when he had to deal with the lower classes, he showed himself  acquainted with their modes of expression, and spoke the Billingsgate of  the market-women, which he had acquired in the rue Comtesse d'Artois,  treating them familiarly, and they generally addressed him as \"gossip  Denies.\" By his own account he easily judged the characters of the  various people with whom he came in contact.    However, Pere Cartault's prophecy was not fulfilled: the blessing of  Heaven did not descend on the Legrand establishment. There seemed to be  a succession of misfortunes which all Derues' zeal and care as shopman  could neither prevent nor repair. He by no means contented himself with  parading an idle and fruitless hypocrisy, and his most abominable  deceptions were not those displayed in the light of day. He watched by  night: his singular organisation, outside the ordinary laws of nature,  appeared able to dispense with sleep. Gliding about on tiptoe, opening  doors noiselessly, with all the skill of an accomplished thief, he  pillaged shop and cellar, and sold his plunder in remote parts of the  town under assumed names. It is difficult to understand how his strength  supported the fatigue of this double existence; he had barely arrived at  puberty, and art had been obliged to assist the retarded development of  nature. But he lived only for evil, and the Spirit of Evil supplied the  physical vigour which was wanting. An insane love of money (the only  passion he knew) brought him by degrees back to his starting-point of  crime; he concealed it in hiding-places wrought in the thick walls, in  holes dug out by his nails. As soon as he got any, he brought it exactly  as a wild beast brings a piece of bleeding flesh to his lair; and often,  by the glimmer of a dark lantern, kneeling in adoration before this  shameful idol, his eyes sparkling with ferocious joy, with a smile which  suggested a hyena's delight over its prey, he would contemplate his  money, counting and kissing it.    These continual thefts brought trouble into the Legrand affairs,  cancelled all profits, and slowly brought on ruin. The widow had no  suspicion of Derues' disgraceful dealings, and he carefully referred the  damage to other causes, quite worthy of himself. Sometimes it was a  bottle of oil, or of brandy, or some other commodity, which was found  spilt, broken, or damaged, which accidents he attributed to the enormous  quantity of rats which infested the cellar and the house. At length,  unable to meet her engagements, Madame Legrand made the business over to  him in February, 1770. He was then twenty-five years and six months old,  and was accepted as a merchant grocer in August the same year. By an  agreement drawn up between them, Derues undertook to pay twelve hundred  livres for the goodwill, and to lodge her rent free during the remainder  of her lease, which had still nine years to run. Being thus obliged to  give up business to escape bankruptcy, Madame Legrand surrendered to her  creditors any goods remaining in her warehouse; and Derues easily made  arrangements to take them over very cheaply. The first step thus made,  he was now able to enrich himself safely and to defraud with impunity  under the cover of his stolen reputation.    One of his uncles, a flour merchant at Chartres, came habitually twice a  year to Paris to settle accounts with his correspondents. A sum of  twelve hundred francs, locked up in a drawer, was stolen from him, and,  accompanied by his nephew, he went to inform the police. On  investigation being made, it was found that the chest of drawers had  been broken at the top. As at the time of the theft of the seventy-nine  Louis from the abbe, Derues was the only person known to have entered  his uncle's room. The innkeeper swore to this, but the uncle took pains  to justify his nephew, and showed his confidence shortly after by  becoming surety for him to the extent of five thousand livres. Derues  failed to pay when the time expired, and the holder of the note was  obliged to sue the surety for it.    He made use of any means, even the most impudent, which enabled him to  appropriate other people's property. A provincial grocer on one occasion  sent him a thousand-weight of honey in barrels to be sold on commission.  Two or three months passed, and he asked for an account of the sale.  Derues replied that he had not yet been able to dispose of it  advantageously, and there ensued a fresh delay, followed by the same  question and the same reply. At length, when more than a year had  passed, the grocer came to Paris, examined his barrels, and found that  five hundred pounds were missing. He claimed damages from Derues, who  declared he had never received any more, and as the honey had been sent  in confidence, and there was no contract and no receipt to show, the  provincial tradesman could not obtain compensation.    As though having risen by the ruin of Madame Legrand and her four  children was not enough, Derues grudged even the morsel of bread he had  been obliged to leave her. A few days after the fire in the cellar,  which enabled him to go through a second bankruptcy, Madame Legrand, now  undeceived and not believing his lamentations, demanded the money due to  her, according to their agreement. Derues pretended to look for his copy  of the contract, and could not find it. \"Give me yours, madame,\" said  he; \"we will write the receipt upon it. Here is the money.\"    The widow opened her purse and took out her copy; Derues snatched it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2749"],[0,"La Constantin (#5)"],[1,"    \"I tried my best to overcome the feeling, and I hid my suspicions from  you. Twenty times I came to see you bursting with anger and determined  to overwhelm you with reproaches, but at the sight of your beauty I  forgot everything but that I loved you. My suspicions dissolved before a  smile; one word from your lips charmed me into happiness. But when I was  again alone my terrors revived, I saw my rivals at your feet, and rage  possessed me once more. Ah! you never knew how devotedly I loved you.\"    She let him speak without interruption; perhaps the same thought was in  her mind as in Quennebert's, who, himself a past master in the art of  lying; was thinking--    \"The man does not believe a word of what he is saying.\"    But the treasurer went on--    \"I can see that even now you doubt my sincerity.\"    \"Does my lord desire that his handmaiden should be blunt? Well, I know  that there is no truth in what you say.\"    \"Oh! I can see that you imagine that among the distractions of the world  I have kept no memory of you, and have found consolation in the love of  less obdurate fair ones. I have not broken in on your retirement; I have  not shadowed your steps; I have not kept watch on your actions; I have  not surrounded you with spies who would perhaps have brought me the  assurance, 'If she quitted the world which outraged her, she was not  driven forth by an impulse of wounded pride or noble indignation; she  did not even seek to punish those who misunderstood her by her absence;  she buried herself where she was unknown, that she might indulge in  stolen loves.' Such were the thoughts that came to me, and yet I  respected your hiding-place; and to-day I am ready to believe you true,  if you will merely say, 'I love no one else!'\"    Jeannin, who was as fat as a stage financier, paused here to gasp; for  the utterance of this string of banalities, this rigmarole of  commonplaces, had left him breathless. He was very much dissatisfied  with his performance; and ready to curse his barren imagination. He  longed to hit upon swelling phrases and natural and touching gestures,  but in vain. He could only look at Mademoiselle de Guerchi with a  miserable, heart-broken air. She remained quietly seated, with the same  expression of incredulity on her features.    So there was nothing for it but to go on once more.    \"But this one assurance that I ask you will not give. So what I  have--been told is true: you have given your love to him.\"    She could not check a startled movement.    \"You see it is only when I speak of him that I can overcome in you the  insensibility which is killing me. My suspicions were true after all:  you deceived me for his sake. Oh! the instinctive feeling of jealousy  was right which forced me to quarrel with that man, to reject the  perfidious friendship which he tried to force upon me. He has returned  to town, and we shall meet! But why do I say 'returned'? Perhaps he only  pretended to go away, and safe in this retreat has flouted with  impunity, my despair and braved my vengeance!\"    Up to this the lady had played a waiting game, but now she grew quite  confused, trying to discover the thread of the treasurer's thoughts. To  whom did he refer? The Duc de Vitry? That had been her first impression.  But the duke had only been acquainted with her for a few months--since  she had--left Court. He could not therefore have excited the jealousy of  her whilom lover; and if it were not he, to whom did the words about  rejecting \"perfidious friendship,\" and \"returned to town,\" and so on,  apply? Jeannin divined her embarrassment, and was not a little proud of  the tactics which would, he was almost sure; force her to expose  herself. For there are certain women who can be thrown into cruel  perplexity by speaking to them of their love-passages without affixing a  proper name label to each. They are placed as it were on the edge of an  abyss, and forced to feel their way in darkness. To say \"You have loved\"  almost obliges them to ask \"Whom?\"    Nevertheless, this was not the word uttered by Mademoiselle de Guerchi  while she ran through in her head a list of possibilities. Her answer  was--    \"Your language astonishes me; I don't understand what you mean.\"    The ice was broken, and the treasurer made a plunge. Seizing one of  Angelique's hands, he asked--    \"Have you never seen Commander de Jars since then?\"    \"Commander de Jars!\" exclaimed Angelique.    \"Can you swear to me, Angelique, that you love him not?\"    \"Mon Dieu! What put it into your head that I ever cared for him? It's  over four months since I saw him last, and I hadn't an idea whether he  was alive or dead. So he has been out of town? That's the first I heard  of it.\"    \"My fortune is yours, Angelique! Oh! assure me once again that you do  not love him--that you never loved him!\" he pleaded in a faltering  voice, fixing a look of painful anxiety upon her.    He had no intention of putting her out of countenance by the course he  took; he knew quite well that a woman like Angelique is never more at  her ease than when she has a chance of telling an untruth of this  nature. Besides, he had prefaced this appeal by the magic words, \"My  fortune' is yours!\" and the hope thus aroused was well worth a perjury.  So she answered boldly and in a steady voice, while she looked straight  into his eyes--    \"Never!\"    \"I believe you!\" exclaimed Jeannin, going down on his knees and covering  with his kisses the hand he still held. \"I can taste happiness again.  Listen, Angelique. I am leaving Paris; my mother is dead, and I am going  back to Spain. Will you follow me thither?\"    \"I---follow you?\"    \"I hesitated long before finding you out, so much did I fear a repulse.  I set out to-morrow. Quit Paris, leave the world which has slandered  you, and come with me. In a fortnight we shall be man and wife.\"    \"You are not in earnest!\"    \"May I expire at your feet if I am not! Do you want me to sign the oath  with my blood?\"    \"Rise,\" she said in a broken voice. \"Have I at last found a man to love  me and compensate me for all the abuse that has been showered on my  head? A thousand times I thank you, not for what you are doing for me,  but for the balm you pour on my wounded spirit. Even if you were to say  to me now, 'After all, I am obliged to give you up' the pleasure of  knowing you esteem me would make up for all the rest. It would be  another happy memory to treasure along with my memory of our love, which  was ineffaceable, although you so ungratefully suspected me of having  deceived you.\"    The treasurer appeared fairly intoxicated with joy. He indulged in a  thousand ridiculous extravagances and exaggerations, and declared  himself the happiest of men. Mademoiselle de Guerchi, who was desirous  of being prepared for every peril, asked him in a coaxing tone--    \"Who can have put it into your head to be jealous of the commander? Has  he been base enough to boast that I ever gave him my love?\"    \"No, he never said anything about you; but someway I was afraid.\"    She renewed her assurances. The conversation continued some time in a  sentimental tone. A thousand oaths, a thousand protestations of love  were, exchanged. Jeannin feared that the suddenness of their journey  would inconvenience his mistress, and offered to put it off for some  days; but to this she would not consent, and it was arranged that the  next day at noon a carriage should call at the house and take Angelique  out of town to an appointed place at which the treasurer was to join  her.    Maitre Quennebert, eye and ear on the alert, had not lost a word of this  conversation, and the last proposition of the treasurer changed his  ideas.    \"Pardieu!\" he said to himself, \"it looks as if this good man were really  going to let himself be taken in and done for. It is singular how very  clear-sighted we can be about things that don't touch us. This poor fly  is going to let himself be caught by a very clever spider, or I'm much  mistaken. Very likely my widow is quite of my opinion, and yet in what  concerns herself she will remain stone-blind. Well, such is life! We  have only two parts to choose between: we must be either knave or fool.  What's Madame Rapally doing, I wonder?\"    At this moment he heard a stifled whisper from the opposite corner of  the room, but, protected by the distance and the darkness, he let the  widow murmur on, and applied his eye once more to his peephole. What he  saw confirmed his opinion. The damsel was springing up and down,  laughing, gesticulating, and congratulating herself on her unexpected  good fortune.    \"Just imagine! He loves me like that!\" she was saying to herself. \"Poor  Jeannin! When I remember how I used to hesitate. How fortunate that  Commander de Jars, one of the most vain and indiscreet of men, never  babbled about me! Yes, we must leave town to-morrow without fail. I must  not give him time to be enlightened by a chance word. But the Duc de  Vitry? I am really sorry for him. However, why did he go away, and send  no word? And then, he's a married man. Ah! if I could only get back  again to court some day!... Who would ever have expected such a thing?  Good God! I must keep talking to myself, to be sure I'm not dreaming.  Yes, he was there, just now, at my feet, saying to me, 'Angelique, you  are going to become my wife.' One thing is sure, he may safely entrust  his honour to my care. It would be infamous to betray a man who loves me  as he does, who will give me his name. Never, no, never will I give him  cause to reproach me! I would rather----\"    A loud and confused noise on the stairs interrupted this soliloquy. At  one moment bursts of laughter were heard, and the next angry voices.  Then a loud exclamation, followed by a short silence. Being alarmed at  this disturbance in a house which was usually so quiet, Mademoiselle de  Guerchi approached the door of her room, intending either to call for"]]]
