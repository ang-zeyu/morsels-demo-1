If he, or you, imagine that  priming you to bring out his ideas like this is going to reconcile me  to the whole business you are mistaken. He might have chosen a more  suitable mouthpiece than that child with the curly hair--\"    Here everybody wishes to reply at once; the resulting jam produces a  moment of silence and I get in first.    \"As for curly hair I am rising twenty-four and I was only saying what  we all thought, if we have the same ideas as M'Clare that is because  he taught us for four years. How else would you set about it anyway?\"    My fellow students pick up their stylers and tap solemnly three times  on the table; this is the Russett equivalent of \"Hear! Hear!\" and the  colonel is surprised.    Eru says coldly, \"This discussion has not been rehearsed. As Lizzie ... as  Miss Lee says, we have been working and thinking together for four years  and have been taught by the same people.\"    \"Very well,\" says Delano-Smith testily. \"Tell me this, please: Do you  regard this idea as practicable?\"    Cray tilts his chair back and remarks to the ceiling, \"This is rather  a farce. I suppose we had to go through our paces for the colonel's  benefit--and Mr. Yardo's of course--but can't we be briefed properly  now?\"    \"What do you mean by that?\" snaps the colonel.    \"It's been obvious right along,\" says Cray, balancing his styler on  one forefinger, \"so obvious none of us has bothered to mention it,  that accepting the normal limitations of Mass-Time, the idea of  interfering in Incognita was doomed before it began. No conventional  ship would have much hope of arriving before war broke out; and if it  did arrive it couldn't do anything effective. Therefore I assume that  this is not a conventional ship. I might accept that the Government  has sent us out in a futile attempt to do the impossible, but I  wouldn't believe that of M'Clare.\"    Cray is the only Terry I know acts like an Outsider's idea of one;  many find this difficult to take and the colonel is plainly one of  them. Eru intervenes quickly.    \"I imagine we all realized that. Anyway this ship is obviously not a  conventional model. If you accept the usual Mass-Time relationship  between the rate of transition and the fifth power of the apparent  acceleration, we must have reached about four times the maximum  already.\"    \"Ram!\" says B suddenly, \"What did you do to stop the Hotel scope  registering the little ship you picked up me and Lizzie in?\"    Everybody cuts in with something they have noticed about the  capabilities of this ship or the hoppers, and Lenny starts hammering  on the table and chanting! \"Brief! Brief! Brief!\" and others are just  starting to join in when Eru bangs on the table and glares us all  down.    Having got silence, he says very quietly, \"Colonel Delano-Smith, I  doubt whether this discussion can usefully proceed without a good deal  more information; will you take over?\"    The colonel looks round at all the eager earnest interested maps  hastily put on for his benefit and decides to take the plunge.    \"Very well. I suppose it is ... very well. The decision to use  students from Russett was made at a very high level, and I suppose--\"  Instead of saying \"Very well\" again he shrugs his shoulders and gets  down to it.    \"The report from the planet we decided to call 'Incognita' was  received thirty-one days ago. The Department of Spatial Affairs has  certain resources which are not generally known. This ship is one of  them. She works on a modified version of Mass-Time which enables her  to use about a thousand channels instead of the normal limit of two  hundred; for good and sufficient reasons this has not been generally  released.\"    Pause while we are silently dared to doubt the Virtue and sufficiency  of these reasons which personally I do not.    \"To travel to Incognita direct would take about fifteen days by the  shortest route. We shall take eighteen days as we shall have to make a  detour.\"    But presumably we shall take only fifteen days back. Hurrah we can  spend a week round the planet and still be back in time for  Commemoration. We shall skip maybe a million awkward questions and I  shall not disappoint Dad.    It is plain the colonel is not filled with joy; far from it, he did  not enjoy revealing a Departmental secret however obvious, but he  likes the next item even less.    \"We shall detour to an uninhabited system twelve days' transit time  from here and make contact with another ship, the _Gilgamesh_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    At which Lennie DiMaggio who has been silent till now brings his fist  down on the table and exclaims, \"You _can't_!\"    Lennie is much upset for some reason; Delano-Smith gives him a  peculiar look and says what does he know about it? and Lennie starts  to stutter.    Cray remarks that Lennie's childhood hobby appears to have been  spaceships and he suffers from arrested development.    B says it is well known Lennie is mad about the Space Force and why  not? It seems to have uses Go on and tell us Lennie.    Lennie says \"_G-Gilgamesh_ was lost three hundred years ago!\"    \"The flaw in that statement,\" says Cray after a pause, \"is that this  may be another ship of the same name.\"    \"No,\" says the colonel. \"Explorer Class cruiser. They went out of  service two hundred eighty years back.\"    The Space Force, I remember, does not re-use names of lost ships: some  says Very Proper Feeling some say Superstitious Rot.    B says, \"When was she found again?\"    [Illustration]    Lennie says it was j-just thirty-seven revolutions of his native  planet which means f-f-fifty-three Terrestrial years ago, she was  found by an Interplanetary scout called _Crusoe_.    Judging by the colonel's expression this data is Classified; he does  not know that Lennie's family come from one of the oldest settled  planets and are space-goers to a man, woman, and juvenile; they pick  up ship gossip the way others hear about the relations of people next  door.    Lennie goes on to say that the Explorer Class were the first official  exploration ships sent out from Earth when the Terries decided to find  out what happened to the colonies formed during the Exodus.  _Gilgamesh_ was the first to re-make contact with Garuda, Legba,  Lister, Cor-bis and Antelope; she vanished on her third voyage.    \"Where was she found?\" asks Eru.    \"Near the p-p-pole of an uninhabited planet--maybe I shouldn't say  where because that may be secret, but the rest's History if you know  where to look.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Maybe the colonel approves this discretion; anyway his face thaws very  slightly unless I am Imagining it.    \"_Gilgamesh_ crashed,\" he says. \"Near as we can make out from the log,  she visited Seleucis system. That's a swarmer sun. Fifty-seven  planets, three settled; and any number of fragments. The navigator  calculated that after a few more revolutions one of the fragments was  going to crash on an inhabited planet. Might have done a lot of  damage. They decided to tow it out of the way.    [Illustration]    \"Grappling-beams hadn't been invented. They thought they could use  Mass-Time on it a kind of reverse thrust--throw it off course.    \"Mass-Time wasn't so well understood then. Bit off more than they  could chew. Set up a topological relation that drained all the free  energy out of the system. Drive, heating system--everything.    \"She had emergency circuits. When the engines came on again they took  over--landed the ship, more or less, on the nearest planet. Too late,  of course. Heating system never came on--there was a safety switch  that had to be thrown by hand. She was embedded in ice when she was  found. Hull breached at one point--no other serious damage.\"    \"And the ... the crew?\"    Dillie ought to know better than that.    \"Lost with all hands,\" says the colonel.    \"How about weapons?\"    We are all startled. Cray is looking whitish like the rest of us but  maintains his normal manner, i.e. offensive affection while pointing  out that _Gilgamesh_ can hardly be taken for a Menace unless she has  some means of aggression about her.    Lennie says The Explorer Class were all armed--    Fine, says Cray, presumably the weapons will be thoroughly obsolete  and recognizable only to a Historian--    Lennie says the construction of no weapon developed by the Space  Department has ever been released; making it plain that anyone but a  Nitwit knows that already.    Eru and Kirsty have been busy for some time writing notes to each  other and she now gives a small sharp cough and having collected our  attention utters the following Address.    \"There is a point we seem to have missed. If I may recapitulate, the  idea is to take this ship _Gilgamesh_ to Incognita and make it appear  as though she had crashed there while attempting to land. I understand  that the ship has been buried in the polar cap; though she must have  been melted out if the people on _Crusoe_ examined the engines. Of  course the cold--All the same there may have been ... well ...  changes. Or when ... when we thaw the ship out again--\"    I find I am swallowing good and hard, and several of the others look  sick, especially Lennie. Lennie has his eyes fixed on the colonel; it  is not prescience, but a slight sideways movement of the colonel's eye  causes him to blurt out, \"What is _he_ doing here?\"    Meaning Mr. Yardo who seems to have been asleep for some time, with  his eyes open and grinning like the spikes on a dog collar. The  colonel gives him another sideways look and says, \"Mr. Yardo is an  expert on the rehabilitation of space-packed materials.\"    This is stuff transported in un-powered hulls towed by  grappling-beams; the hulls are open to space hence no need for  refrigeration, and the contents are transferred to specially equipped  orbital stations before being taken down to the"]]]
