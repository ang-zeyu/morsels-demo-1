Firecrackers and torpedoes,     Trumpet and flag and drum,   Rockets and pinwheels and paper caps,     For Fourth of July had come.     \"But it makes me sort o' sorry,\"     Wee Willie said with a sigh,   \"To think of those poor little English boys     Without any Fourth of July.\"           A Bicycle built for Two       There was an ambitious young eel   Who determined to ride on a wheel;         But try as he might,         He couldn't ride right,   In spite of his ardor and zeal.     If he sat on the saddle to ride   His tail only pedalled one side;         And I'm sure you'll admit         That an eel _couldn't_ sit   On a bicycle saddle astride.     Or if he hung over the top,   He could go, but he never could stop;         For of course it is clear         He had no way to steer,   And under the wheel he would flop.     His neighbor, observing the fun,   Said, \"I think that the thing can be done,         If you'll listen to me,         You'll quickly agree   That two heads are better than one.     \"And this is my project, old chap,   Around our two waists I will wrap         This beautiful belt         Of bottle-green felt   And fasten it firm with a strap.\"     [Illustration]     This done, with a dignified mien   The two squirmed up on the machine,         And rode gayly away,         Or at least, so they say,   Who witnessed the wonderful scene.           [Illustration]     Dorothy's Opinion       Mamma has bought a calendar,     And every single page   Has pictures on of little girls     'Most just about my age.     And when she bought it yesterday,     Down at the big bazaar,   She said, \"What lovely little girls,     How true to life they are.\"     But I don't think they're true to life,     And I'll just tell you why;   They never have a rumpled frock     Or ribbon bow awry.     And though they play with cats and dogs,     And rabbits and white mice,   And sail their boats and fly their kites,     They always look so nice.     And I am sure no little girl     That ever _I_ have seen,   Could play with dogs or sail a boat     And keep her frock so clean.     [Illustration]           The Roll of Roly Poly Roy       [Illustration]     Once on a time a lad I knew--     His sister called him Bubby;   His cheeks were red, his eyes were blue,     And he was plump and chubby.   Indeed, he was so stout a boy,   Some called him Roly Poly Roy;       They called him that       For he was fat   And very plump and chubby.     [Illustration]     He caused his father grief profound,     And made his mother worry,   Because he'd roll along the ground     When he was in a hurry.   For as he couldn't see his toes,   He often tumbled on his nose;       So, on the whole,       'Twas best to roll   When he was in a hurry.     \"Get up!\" the people urged, but he     Replied, \"There's no use talking;   I roll around because, you see,     It's easier than walking.\"   And though it looked extremely droll   To see the lad lie down and roll,       It was, forsooth,       For that fat youth   Far easier than walking.     [Illustration]     One day he thought he'd try to ride;     Alas, he was so bulky,   He tumbled off the other side,     Which made him rather sulky.   He heard his comrades jeer and scoff,   Again he tried and tumbled off,       And when he fell       They'd shout and yell--     Of course it made him sulky.     Just out of town there was a place     With rolling ground and hilly,   And here Roy started for a race     With Dick and Tom and Willy.   You'll know of course before you're told   That Roy just laid him down and rolled;       And so, you see,       He easily     Beat Dick and Tom and Willy.     That day two giants came along     From Huncamunca Valley,   Seeking some tenpins good and strong     For their new bowling alley.   They reached the hilly sort of place   Just as our hero won the race;       \"Look at him roll!\"       They said. \"He'll bowl     On our new bowling alley.     \"The other boys are squarely built;     For tenpins they'll do finely!   No matter if a few get kilt,\"     And then they smiled benignly.   Quickly they kidnapped ten small boys,   All howling with a fearful noise;       They took them all,       And Roy for ball,     And then they smiled benignly.     [Illustration]     They hurried to their home and then     Began their barbarous bowling.   They set in rows the children ten     And then set Roy a-rolling.   But as the giants were strong and great,   They shot poor Roy at such a rate,       And with such might,       That out of sight     Poor Roy was set a-rolling.     [Illustration]     He rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled,     But soon, his fears dispelling,   With happiness he did behold     He'd safely reached his dwelling.   Secure and safe from further harms,   His mother caught him in her arms,       And said with joy,       \"My darling boy,    You've safely reached your dwelling.\"     Now rolling seems to him to be     More dangerous than walking.   And Roly Poly Roy you'll see     Along the sidewalks stalking.   He'll always have a certain fear   That giants may be lurking near,       And so he'll go       With motion slow     Along the sidewalk stalking.     [Illustration]           My Barometer       [Illustration]     My little maid with golden hair     Comes each morning for a kiss;   And I know the day will be fine and fair     When Polly looks like this.     [Illustration]     Or I know the clouds will frown and lower,     The skies will be dull and gray,   And perhaps there'll be a passing shower,     When Polly looks this way.     [Illustration]     But a violent storm of rain or snow     I can prognosticate,   For the sign will never fail, I know,     When this is Polly's pate.           The Butter Betty Bought       Betty Botta bought some butter;   \"But,\" said she, \"this butter's bitter!   If I put it in my batter   It will make my batter bitter.   But a bit o' better butter   Will but make my batter better.\"   Then she bought a bit o' butter   Better than the bitter butter,   Made her bitter batter better.   So 'twas better Betty Botta   Bought a bit o' better butter.           [Illustration]     A Marvel       An old astronomer there was     Who lived up in a tower,   Named Ptolemy Copernicus     Flammarion McGower.   He said: \"I can prognosticate     With estimates correct;   And when the skies I contemplate,     I know what to expect.   When dark'ning clouds obscure my sight,     I think perhaps 'twill rain;   And when the stars are shining bright,     I know 'tis clear again.\"   And then abstractedly he scanned     The heavens, hour by hour,   Old Ptolemy Copernicus     Flammarion McGower.           An Alphabet Zoo       A was an apt Alligator,   Who wanted to be a head-waiter;       He said, \"I opine       In that field I could shine,   Because I am such a good skater.\"     B was a beggarly Bear,   Who carefully curled his front hair;       He said, \"I would buy       A red-spotted tie,--   But I haven't a penny to spare.\"     C was a cool Chimpanzee,   Who went to an afternoon tea.       When they said, \"Will you take       A caraway cake?\"   He greedily took twenty-three!     D was a diligent Doe,   In summer she shovelled the snow;       In the spring and the fall       She did nothing at all,   And in winter the grass she would mow.     E was an erudite Ermine,   Who tried very hard to determine       If he _should_ earn a cent,       How it ought to be spent,   And decided to purchase a sermon.     F was a fussy Flamingo,   Who remarked to his family, \"By jingo!       I think I would go       To that animal show,   But they all talk such barbarous lingo.\"     G was a giddy Gazelle,   Who never could learn how to spell;       But she managed to pass       To the head of her class,   Because she did fractions so well.     H was a haughty young Hawk,   Who affected society talk;       But when introduced       At a large chicken roost   He excitedly screamed out, \"Oh, Lawk!\"     I was an idle Iguana,   Who lived upon curried banana;       With tears he'd protest       That he never could rest   Till he learned to sing \"Eileen Alanna.\"     J was a jimp Jaguar,   Who purchased a Spanish guitar;       He played popular airs       At _fetes_ and at fairs,   And down at the Fancy Bazaar.     K was a kind Kangaroo,   Whose bonnet was always askew;       So they asked her to wait       While they put it on straight   And fastened it firmly with glue.     L was a lachrymose Leopard,   Who ate up twelve sheep and a shepherd,       But the real reason why       He continued to cry   Was his food was so lavishly peppered.     M was a mischievous Marten,   Who went to the Free Kindergarten;       When they asked him to plat       A gay-colored mat,   He tackled the job like a Spartan.     N was a naughty Nylghau,   Who wandered too near a buzz saw.       It cut off his toes,       And the shrieks that arose   Filled all of the neighbors with awe.     O was an ossified Oyster,   Who decided to enter a cloister.       He could not return,       So continued to yearn   For his home in the sea, which was moister.     P was a poor old Poll Parrot,   Who had nothing to eat but a carrot,       And nothing to wear       But a wig of red hair,   And nowhere to live but a garret.     Q was a querulous Quab   Who at every trifle would sob;       He said, \"I detest       To wear a plaid vest,   And I hate to eat corn from the cob!\"     R was a rollicking Ram,   Attired in an old pillow sham.       When asked if he'd call       At the masquerade ball,   He said, \"I'll go just as I am.\"     S was a shy Salamander,   Who slept on a sunny veranda.       She calmly reposed,       But, alas! while she dozed   They caught her and killed her and canned her.     T was a tidy young Tapir,   Who went out to bring in the paper;       And when he came back       He made no muddy track,   For he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24561"],[0,"A Report of the Debates and Proceedings in the Secret Sessions of the Conference (#5)"],[1,"the West, to  see whether our wisdom can devise some means to avert the dangers  which threaten to destroy this noble Republic, founded by the wisdom  and patriotism of our ancestors. I hope we are animated by a common  purpose. The storm is threatening. The horizon is covered with dark  and portentous clouds. Section is arrayed against section, and already  _seven_ of our sister States have separated from us and are proceeding  to establish an independent Confederation. War! Civil War! is  impending over us. It must be averted! Who does not know that such a  war, among such a people, must be, if it comes, a war of  extermination.    Mr. PRESIDENT, I move the adoption of the resolution which I now send  to the chair.    The resolution of Mr. GUTHRIE was read as follows:         _Resolved_, That a committee of one from each State be       appointed by the Commissioners thereof, to be nominated to       the President, and to be appointed by him, to whom shall be       referred the resolutions of the State of Virginia, and the       other States represented, and all propositions for the       adjustment of existing difficulties between States, with       authority to report what they may deem right, necessary, and       proper to restore harmony and preserve the Union, and that       they report on or before Friday next.    Mr. SEDDON:--It appears to me that the mode pointed out by the  resolution introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky, is neither the  one most appropriate nor expeditious for accomplishing the result  desired. We are convened under the invitation of the State of  Virginia; and the same invitation that brings us here, proposes the  basis for our deliberation and action. Virginia has stated what will  be satisfactory to her; not as an _ultimatum_, but as a basis of  adjustment. It appears to me that the proper course would be, to take  up the propositions of Virginia--propose amendments to them--discuss  them, and in the end determine how far they shall be adopted. The  adoption of the resolution proposed, transfers the labors of this  Conference, not in itself too large for convenient deliberation, to a  committee. That committee is to discuss the various propositions  offered and report the result. What, in the mean time, is this  Conference to do? Nothing whatever! We are to meet here from day to  day and adjourn, no one knows how long, until this committee reports,  and then the discussion will commence which ought to commence now. Mr.  PRESIDENT, if any thing is accomplished, it must be accomplished  speedily. Events are on the wing. Already in my State the delegates  are elected to a Convention, which is to meet next week, to consider  the subject which now engrosses the minds of the American people. I  hope my suggestion may meet with favor in the Conference.    Mr. EWING:--I cannot agree with the gentleman from Virginia, for  reasons which must be obvious to all. I do not think Virginia intended  to dictate the terms upon which we were to act. I am in favor of the  resolution, but would make one suggestion in relation to it. By its  terms the committee is to report on Friday, if it can properly do so.  I suggest that the committee should have leave to sit during the  sessions of the Conference. In this way our business may be greatly  expedited.    Mr. GUTHRIE:--It gives me pleasure to accept the modification proposed  by the gentleman from Ohio. I should have incorporated it into my  resolution.    The resolution as modified was then adopted by the Conference without  a division.    The PRESIDENT:--I will take this occasion to announce a committee to  carry into effect the determination of the Conference relating to the  obtaining of the services of clergymen to open the proceedings of the  Conference daily with prayer. The Chair appoints as such committee,  Mr. RANDOLPH, of New Jersey, Mr. WICKLIFFE, of Kentucky, and Mr.  JOHNSON, of Maryland.    Mr. JOHNSON:--It appears to me very appropriate, in view of the  occasion which has brought us together, that the members of this  Conference should pay their respects in a body to the President of the  United States. I therefore move that we call upon him in a body at  such a time as will be most agreeable to him; such time to be  ascertained by the President of this Conference.    Which motion was unanimously agreed to.    Mr. CLAY:--I move the reconsideration of the vote by which the portion  of the report of the Committee on Rules and Organization not yet  adopted was recommitted to that committee. I do this in order that the  Conference may now proceed to the consideration of those rules which  may be adopted without much difference of opinion.    The vote was thereupon reconsidered, and the following rules were  severally read and adopted. The remaining rules recommended were  recommitted to the committee:      RULES.    I. A Convention to do business, shall consist of the Commissioners of  not less than seven States; and all questions shall be decided by the  greater number of those which be fully represented. But a less number  than seven may adjourn from day to day.    II. Immediately after the President shall have taken the chair, and  the members their seats, the minutes of the preceding day shall be  read by the Secretary.    III. Every member, rising to speak, shall address the President; and  while he shall be speaking none shall pass between them, or hold  discourse with another, or read a book, pamphlet, or paper, printed or  manuscript; and of two members rising to speak at the same time, the  President shall name him who shall first be heard.    IV. A member shall not speak oftener than twice, without special  leave upon the same question; and not a second time before every other  who had been silent shall have been heard, if he choose to speak upon  the subject.    V. A motion made and seconded, shall be repeated; and if written, as  it shall be when any member shall so require, read aloud by the  Secretary before it shall be debated; and may be withdrawn at any time  before the vote upon it shall have been declared.    VI. Orders of the day shall be read next after the minutes, and either  discussed or postponed, before any other business shall be introduced.    VII. When a debate shall arise upon a question, no motion, other than  to amend the question, to commit it, or to postpone the debate, shall  be received.    VIII. A question which is complicated, shall, at the request of any  member, be divided and put separately upon the propositions of which  it is compounded.    IX. A writing which contains any matter brought on to be considered,  shall be read once, throughout, for information; then by paragraphs,  to be debated, and again with the amendments, if any, made on the  second reading, and afterwards the question shall be put upon the  whole, as amended or approved in the original form, as the case may  be.    X. Committees shall be appointed by the President, unless otherwise  ordered by the Convention.    XI. A member may be called to order by another member, as well as by  the President, and may be allowed to explain his conduct or  expressions supposed to be reprehensible. And all questions of order  shall be decided by the President, without appeal or debate.    XII. Upon a question to adjourn for the day, which may be made at any  time, if it be seconded, the question shall be put without debate.    XIII. When the Convention shall adjourn, every member shall stand in  his place until the President pass him.    XIV. That no member be absent from the Convention, so as to interrupt  the representation of the State, without leave.    XV. That Committees do not sit while the Convention shall be, or ought  to be sitting, without leave of the Convention.    XVI. That no copy be taken of any entry on the Journal, during the  sitting of the Convention, without leave of the Convention.    XVII. That members only be permitted to inspect the Journal.    XVIII. _Mode of Voting._ All votes shall be taken by States, and each  State to give one vote. The yeas and nays of the members shall not be  given or published--only the decision by States.    After the adoption of the foregoing Rules, the Conference adjourned  until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.          FOURTH DAY.    WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, _February 7th, 1861._      The Conference convened, pursuant to the adjournment yesterday, at 10  o'clock A.M.    It was called to order by President TYLER, and prayer was offered by  Rev. Dr. PYNE, of Washington.    The Journal of yesterday was read, and after sundry amendments, was  approved.    Messrs. J.H. PULESTON, JOHN STRYKER, W.W. HOPPIN, Jr., and ----  Olcott, took their places as Assistant Secretaries.    President TYLER:--Gentlemen of the Conference, as directed by the  resolution which you adopted yesterday, I addressed a note to the  President of the United States, asking at what hour it would be  agreeable to him that this Conference should call on him in a body. To  this note I have received a reply which will be read by the Secretary.    The Secretary then read the following note from the President:         EXECUTIVE MANSION, _February 6th, 1861._         My DEAR SIR:--I shall feel greatly honored to receive the       gentlemen composing the Convention of Commissioners from the       several States, on any day and at any hour most convenient       to themselves. I shall name to-morrow (Thursday) at 11 or 3       o'clock, though any other time would be equally agreeable to       me. I shall at all times be prepared to give them a cordial       welcome.         Yours, very respectfully,         JAMES BUCHANAN.         His Excellency, JOHN TYLER.    The PRESIDENT:--What order will the Conference take upon the subject?    Mr. GUTHRIE:--I move that the members of this Conference call in a  body upon the President of the United States this morning, at 11  o'clock.    Mr. GUTHRIE'S motion was adopted unanimously.
