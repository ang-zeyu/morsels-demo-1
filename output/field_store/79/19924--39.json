Little value as it has, I implore you to accept it  as the ransom of your own.\"    \"Well,\" resumed the young man, \"this is why I suspected they had killed  my nurse and my preceptor--\"    \"Whom you used to call your father?\"    \"Yes; whom I called my father, but whose son I well knew I was not.\"    \"Who caused you to suppose so?\"    \"Just as you, monsieur, are too respectful for a friend, he was also too  respectful for a father.\"    \"I, however,\" said Aramis, \"have no intention to disguise myself.\"    The young man nodded assent and continued: \"Undoubtedly, I was not  destined to perpetual seclusion,\" said the prisoner; \"and that which  makes me believe so, above all, now, is the care that was taken to  render me as accomplished a cavalier as possible. The gentleman attached  to my person taught me everything he knew himself--mathematics, a little  geometry, astronomy, fencing and riding. Every morning I went through  military exercises, and practiced on horseback. Well, one morning during  the summer, it being very hot, I went to sleep in the hall. Nothing, up  to that period, except the respect paid me, had enlightened me, or even  roused my suspicions. I lived as children, as birds, as plants, as the  air and the sun do. I had just turned my fifteenth year--\"    \"This, then, is eight years ago?\"    \"Yes, nearly; but I have ceased to reckon time.\"    \"Excuse me; but what did your tutor tell you, to encourage you to work?\"    \"He used to say that a man was bound to make for himself, in the world,  that fortune which Heaven had refused him at his birth. He added that,  being a poor, obscure orphan, I had no one but myself to look to; and  that nobody either did, or ever would, take any interest in me. I  was, then, in the hall I have spoken of, asleep from fatigue with long  fencing. My preceptor was in his room on the first floor, just over  me. Suddenly I heard him exclaim, and then he called: 'Perronnette!  Perronnette!' It was my nurse whom he called.\"    \"Yes, I know it,\" said Aramis. \"Continue, monseigneur.\"    \"Very likely she was in the garden; for my preceptor came hastily  downstairs. I rose, anxious at seeing him anxious. He opened the  garden-door, still crying out, 'Perronnette! Perronnette!' The windows  of the hall looked into the court; the shutters were closed; but through  a chink in them I saw my tutor draw near a large well, which was almost  directly under the windows of his study. He stooped over the brim,  looked into the well, and again cried out, and made wild and affrighted  gestures. Where I was, I could not only see, but hear--and see and hear  I did.\"    \"Go on, I pray you,\" said Aramis.    \"Dame Perronnette came running up, hearing the governor's cries. He went  to meet her, took her by the arm, and drew her quickly towards the edge;  after which, as they both bent over it together, 'Look, look,' cried he,  'what a misfortune!'    \"'Calm yourself, calm yourself,' said Perronnette; 'what is the matter?'    \"'The letter!' he exclaimed; 'do you see that letter?' pointing to the  bottom of the well.    \"'What letter?' she cried.    \"'The letter you see down there; the last letter from the queen.'    \"At this word I trembled. My tutor--he who passed for my father, he who  was continually recommending me modesty and humility--in correspondence  with the queen!    \"'The queen's last letter!' cried Perronnette, without showing more  astonishment than at seeing this letter at the bottom of the well; 'but  how came it there?'    \"'A chance, Dame Perronnette--a singular chance. I was entering my room,  and on opening the door, the window, too, being open, a puff of air came  suddenly and carried off this paper--this letter of her majesty's; I  darted after it, and gained the window just in time to see it flutter a  moment in the breeze and disappear down the well.'    \"'Well,' said Dame Perronnette; 'and if the letter has fallen into the  well, 'tis all the same as if it was burnt; and as the queen burns all  her letters every time she comes--'    \"And so you see this lady who came every month was the queen,\" said the  prisoner.    \"'Doubtless, doubtless,' continued the old gentleman; 'but this letter  contained instructions--how can I follow them?'    \"'Write immediately to her; give her a plain account of the accident,  and the queen will no doubt write you another letter in place of this.'    \"'Oh! the queen would never believe the story,' said the good gentleman,  shaking his head; 'she will imagine that I want to keep this letter  instead of giving it up like the rest, so as to have a hold over her.  She is so distrustful, and M. de Mazarin so--Yon devil of an Italian is  capable of having us poisoned at the first breath of suspicion.'\"    Aramis almost imperceptibly smiled.    \"'You know, Dame Perronnette, they are both so suspicious in all that  concerns Philippe.'    \"Philippe was the name they gave me,\" said the prisoner.    \"'Well, 'tis no use hesitating,' said Dame Perronnette, 'somebody must  go down the well.'    \"'Of course; so that the person who goes down may read the paper as he  is coming up.'    \"'But let us choose some villager who cannot read, and then you will be  at ease.'    \"'Granted; but will not any one who descends guess that a paper must be  important for which we risk a man's life? However, you have given me  an idea, Dame Perronnette; somebody shall go down the well, but that  somebody shall be myself.'    \"But at this notion Dame Perronnette lamented and cried in such a  manner, and so implored the old nobleman, with tears in her eyes, that  he promised her to obtain a ladder long enough to reach down, while she  went in search of some stout-hearted youth, whom she was to persuade  that a jewel had fallen into the well, and that this jewel was wrapped  in a paper. 'And as paper,' remarked my preceptor, 'naturally unfolds  in water, the young man would not be surprised at finding nothing, after  all, but the letter wide open.'    \"'But perhaps the writing will be already effaced by that time,' said  Dame Perronnette.    \"'No consequence, provided we secure the letter. On returning it to  the queen, she will see at once that we have not betrayed her; and  consequently, as we shall not rouse the distrust of Mazarin, we shall  have nothing to fear from him.'    \"Having come to this resolution, they parted. I pushed back the shutter,  and, seeing that my tutor was about to re-enter, I threw myself on  my couch, in a confusion of brain caused by all I had just heard. My  governor opened the door a few moments after, and thinking I was asleep  gently closed it again. As soon as ever it was shut, I rose, and,  listening, heard the sound of retiring footsteps. Then I returned to the  shutters, and saw my tutor and Dame Perronnette go out together. I was  alone in the house. They had hardly closed the gate before I sprang from  the window and ran to the well. Then, just as my governor had leaned  over, so leaned I. Something white and luminous glistened in the green  and quivering silence of the water. The brilliant disk fascinated and  allured me; my eyes became fixed, and I could hardly breathe. The well  seemed to draw me downwards with its slimy mouth and icy breath; and I  thought I read, at the bottom of the water, characters of fire traced  upon the letter the queen had touched. Then, scarcely knowing what I was  about, and urged on by one of those instinctive impulses which drive  men to destruction, I lowered the cord from the windlass of the well to  within about three feet of the water, leaving the bucket dangling, at  the same time taking infinite pains not to disturb that coveted  letter, which was beginning to change its white tint for the hue of  chrysoprase,--proof enough that it was sinking,--and then, with the  rope weltering in my hands, slid down into the abyss. When I saw myself  hanging over the dark pool, when I saw the sky lessening above my head,  a cold shudder came over me, a chill fear got the better of me, I was  seized with giddiness, and the hair rose on my head; but my strong will  still reigned supreme over all the terror and disquietude. I gained  the water, and at once plunged into it, holding on by one hand, while I  immersed the other and seized the dear letter, which, alas! came in two  in my grasp. I concealed the two fragments in my body-coat, and, helping  myself with my feet against the sides of the pit, and clinging on with  my hands, agile and vigorous as I was, and, above all, pressed for time,  I regained the brink, drenching it as I touched it with the water that  streamed off me. I was no sooner out of the well with my prize, than I  rushed into the sunlight, and took refuge in a kind of shrubbery at  the bottom of the garden. As I entered my hiding-place, the bell which  resounded when the great gate was opened, rang. It was my preceptor come  back again. I had but just time. I calculated that it would take ten  minutes before he would gain my place of concealment, even if, guessing  where I was, he came straight to it; and twenty if he were obliged to  look for me. But this was time enough to allow me to read the cherished  letter, whose fragments I hastened to unite again. The writing was  already fading, but I managed to decipher it all.    \"And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?\" asked Aramis,  deeply interested.    \"Quite enough, monsieur, to see that my tutor was a man of noble rank,  and that Perronnette, without being a lady of quality, was far better  than a servant; and also to perceived that I must myself be high-born,  since the queen, Anne of Austria, and Mazarin, the prime minister,  commended me so earnestly to their care.\" Here the young man paused,  quite overcome.    \"And what happened?\" asked Aramis.    \"It happened, monsieur,\" answered he, \"that the workmen they had  summoned found nothing in the well, after the closest search; that my  governor perceived that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27600"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. II (#5)"],[1,"secretion stands upon the skin in drops for want of  exhalation, the lungs are exposed to an insalubrious atmosphere.    I do not deny, that sweating may be so managed as to be serviceable in  preventing the return of the cold paroxysm of fevers; like the warm bath,  or any other permanent stimulus, as wine, or opium, or the bark. For this  purpose it should be continued till past the time of the expected cold fit,  supported by moderate doses of wine-whey, with spirit of hartshorn, and  moderate degrees of warmth. Its salutary effect, when thus managed, was  probably one cause of its having been so much attended to; and the fetid  smell, which when profuse is liable to accompany it, gave occasion to the  belief, that the supposed material cause of the disease was thus eliminated  from the circulation.    When too great external heat is applied, the system is weakened by excess  of action, and the torpor which causes the cold paroxysm recurs sooner and  more violently. For though some stimuli, as of opium and alcohol, at the  same time that they exhaust the sensorial power by promoting increase of  fibrous action, may also increase the production or secretion of it in the  brain, yet experience teaches us, that the exhaustion far out-balances the  increased production, as is evinced by the general debility, which succeeds  intoxication.    In respect to the fetor attending copious continued sweats, it is owing to  the animalized part of this fluid being kept in that degree of warmth,  which most favours putrefaction, and not suffered to exhale into the  atmosphere. Broth, or other animal mucus, kept in similar circumstances,  would in the same time acquire a putrid smell; yet has this error  frequently produced miliary eruptions, and increased every kind of  inflammatory or sensitive fever.    The ease, which the patient experiences during sweating, if it be not  produced by much external heat, is similar to that of the warm bath; which  by its stimulus applied to the cutaneous vessels, which are generally  cooler than the internal parts of the system, excites them into greater  action; and pleasureable sensation is the consequence of these increased  actions of the vessels of the skin. From considering all these  circumstances, it appears that it is not the evacuation by sweats, but the  continued stimulus, which causes and supports those sweats, which is  serviceable in preventing the returns of fever-fits. And that sweats too  long continued, or induced by too great stimulus of warmth, clothes, or  medicines, greatly injure the patient by increasing inflammation, or by  exhausting the sensorial power. See Class I. 1. 2. 14.    _Secondly_, The sweats produced by exercise or labour are of the warm kind;  as they originate from the increased action of the capillaries of the skin,  owing to their being more powerfully stimulated by the greater velocity of  the blood, and by a greater quantity of it passing through them in a given  time. For the blood during violent exercise is carried forwards by the  action of the muscles faster in the arteries, than it can be taken up by  the veins; as appears by the redness of the skin. And from the consequent  sweats, it is evinced, that the secretory vessels of the skin during  exercise pour out the perspirable matter faster, than the mouths of the  absorbent vessels can drink it up. Which mouths are not exposed to the  increased muscular action, or to the stimulus of the increased velocity and  quantity of the blood, but to the cool air.    _Thirdly_, the increased secretion of perspirable matter occasioned by the  stimulus of external heat belongs likewise to this place; as it is caused  by the increased motions of the capillary vessels; which thus separate from  the blood more perspirable matter, than the mouths of their correspondent  absorbent vessels can take up; though these also are stimulated by external  heat into more energetic action. If the air be stationary, as in a small  room, or bed with closed curtains, the sweat stands in drops on the skin  for want of a quicker exhalation proportioned to the quicker secretion.    A _fourth_ variety of warm perspiration is that occasioned by stimulating  drugs, of which opium and alcohol are the most powerful; and next to these  the spices, volatile alkali, and neutral salts, especially sea salt; that  much of the aqueous part of the blood is dissipated by the use of these  drugs, is evinced by the great thirst, which occurs a few hours after the  use of them. See Art. III. 2. 12. and Art. III. 2. 1.    We may from hence understand, that the increase of this secretion of  perspirable matter by artificial means, must be followed by debility and  emaciation. When this is done by taking much salt, or salted meat, the  sea-scurvy is produced; which consists in the inirritability of the  bibulous terminations of the veins arising from the capillaries; see Class  I. 2. 1. 14. The scrophula, or inirritability of the lymphatic glands,  seems also to be occasionally induced by an excess in eating salt added to  food of bad nourishment. See Class I. 2. 3. 21. If an excess of  perspiration is induced by warm or stimulant clothing, as by wearing  flannel in contact with the skin in the summer months, a perpetual  febricula is excited, both by the preventing the access of cool air to the  skin, and by perpetually goading it by the numerous and hard points of the  ends of the wool; which when applied to the tender skins of young children,  frequently produce the red gum, as it is called; and in grown people,  either an erysipelas, or a miliary eruption, attended with fever. See Class  II. 1. 3. 12.    Shirts made of cotton or calico stimulate the skin too much by the points  of the fibres, though less than flannel; whence cotton handkerchiefs make  the nose sore by frequent use. The fibres of cotton are, I suppose, ten  times shorter than those of flax, and the number of points in consequence  twenty times the number; and though the manufacturers singe their calicoes  on a red-hot iron cylinder, yet I have more than once seen an erysipelas  induced or increased by the stimulus of calico, as well as of flannel.    The increase of perspiration by heat either of clothes, or of fire,  contributes much to emaciate the body; as is well known to jockeys, who,  when they are a stone or two too heavy for riding, find the quickest way to  lessen their weight is by sweating themselves between blankets in a warm  room; but this likewise is a practice by no means to be recommended, as it  weakens the system by the excess of so general a stimulus, brings on a  premature old age, and shortens the span of life; as may be further deduced  from the quick maturity, and shortness of the lives, of the inhabitants of  Hindostan, and other tropical climates.    M. Buffon made a curious experiment to shew this circumstance. He took a  numerous brood of the butterflies of silkworms, some hundreds of which left  their eggs on the same day and hour; these he divided into two parcels; and  placing one parcel in the south window, and the other in the north window  of his house, he observed, that those in the colder situation lived many  days longer than those in the warmer one. From these observations it  appears, that the wearing of flannel clothing next the skin, which is now  so much in fashion, however useful it may be in the winter to those, who  have cold extremities, bad digestions, or habitual coughs, must greatly  debilitate them, if worn in the warm months, producing fevers, eruptions,  and premature old age. See Sect. XXXVII. 5. Class I. 1. 2. 14. Art. III. 2.  1.    4. _Urina uberior colorata._ Copious coloured urine. Towards the end of  fever-fits a large quantity of high coloured urine is voided, the kidneys  continuing to act strongly, after the increased action of the absorbents of  the bladder is somewhat diminished. If the absorbents continue also to act  strongly, the urine is higher coloured, and so loaded as to deposit, when  cool, an earthy sediment, erroneously thought to be the material cause of  the disease; but is simply owing to the secretion of the kidnies being  great from their increased action; and the thinner parts of it being  absorbed by the increased action of the lymphatics, which are spread very  thick on the neck of the bladder; for the urine, as well as perhaps all the  other secreted fluids, is produced from the kidnies in a very dilute state;  as appears in those, who from the stimulus of a stone, or other cause,  evacuate their urine too frequently; which is then pale from its not having  remained in the bladder long enough for the more aqueous part to have been  reabsorbed. The general use of this urinary absorption to the animal  oeconomy is evinced from the urinary bladders of fish, which would  otherwise be unnecessary. High coloured urine in large quantity shews only,  that the secreting vessels of the kidnies, and the absorbents of the  bladder, have acted with greater energy. When there is much earthy  sediment, it shews, that the absorbents have acted proportionally stronger,  and have consequently left the urine in a less dilute state. In this urine  the transparent sediment or cloud is mucous; the opake sediment is probably  coagulable lymph from the blood changed by an animal or chemical process.  The floating scum is oil. The angular concretions to the sides of the pot,  formed as the urine cools, is microcosmic salt. Does the adhesive blue  matter on the sides of the glass, or the blue circle on it at the edge of  the upper surface of the urine, consist of Prussian blue?    5. _Diarrhoea calida._ Warm diarrhoea. This species may be divided into  three varieties deduced from their remote causes, under the names of  diarrhoea febrilis, diarrhoea crapulosa, and diarrhoea infantum. The  febrile diarrhoea appears at the end of fever-fits, and is erroneously  called critical, like the copious urine, and the"]]]
