Then gradually he settled down upon the earth and  said, \"Where my heart rests, mark a spot, and build a town of the  Mid-most, for there shall be the Mid-most Place of the Earth-mother.\"    And his heart rested over the middle of the plain and valley of Zuni.  And when he drew in his finger-legs, lo! there were the trail-roads  leading out and in like stays of a spider's nest, into and from the  mid-most place he had covered.    Here because of their good fortune in finding the stable Middle, the  priest father called the town the Abiding-place-of-happy-fortune.    (1) The earth was flat and round, like a plate.    (2) Lava.          Origin of Light  Gallinomero (Russian River, Cal.)    In the earliest beginning, the darkness was thick and deep. There was no  light. The animals ran here and there, always bumping into each other.  The birds flew here and there, but continually knocked against each  other.    Hawk and Coyote thought a long time about the darkness. Then Coyote felt  his way into a swamp and found a large number of dry tule reeds. He made  a ball of them. He gave the ball to Hawk, with some flints, and Hawk  flew up into the sky, where he touched off the tule reeds and sent the  bundle whirling around the world. But still the nights were dark, so  Coyote made another bundle of tule reeds, and Hawk flew into the air  with them, and touched them off with the flints. But these reeds were  damp and did not burn so well. That is why the moon does not give so  much light as the sun.          Pokoh, the Old Man  Pai Ute (near Kern River, Cal.)    Pokoh, Old Man, they say, created the world. Pokoh had many thoughts. He  had many blankets in which he carried around gifts for men. He created  every tribe out of the soil where they used to live. That is why an  Indian wants to live and die in his native place. He was made of the  same soil. Pokoh did not wish men to wander and travel, but to remain in  their birthplace.    Long ago, Sun was a man, and was bad. Moon was good. Sun had a quiver  full of arrows, and they are deadly. Sun wishes to kill all things.    Sun has two daughters (Venus and Mercury) and twenty men kill them; but  after fifty days, they return to life again.    Rainbow is the sister of Pokoh, and her breast is covered with flowers.    Lightning strikes the ground and fills the flint with fire. That is the  origin of fire. Some say the beaver brought fire from the east, hauling  it on his broad, flat tail. That is why the beaver's tail has no hair on  it, even to this day. It was burned off.    There are many worlds. Some have passed and some are still to come. In  one world the Indians all creep; in another they all walk; in another  they all fly. Perhaps in a world to come, Indians may walk on four legs;  or they may crawl like snakes; or they may swim in the water like fish.          Thunder and Lightning  Maidu (near Sacramento Valley, Cal.)    Great-Man created the world and all the people. At first the earth was  very hot, so hot it was melted, and that is why even to-day there is  fire in the trunk and branches of trees, and in the stones.    Lightning is Great-Man himself coming down swiftly from his world above,  and tearing apart the trees with his flaming arm.    Thunder and Lightning are two great spirits who try to destroy mankind.  But Rainbow is a good spirit who speaks gently to them, and persuades  them to let the Indians live a little longer.          Creation of Man  Miwok (San Joaquin Valley, Cal.)    After Coyote had completed making the world, he began to think about  creating man. He called a council of all the animals. The animals sat in  a circle, just as the Indians do, with Lion at the head, in an open  space in the forest. On Lion's right was Grizzly Bear; next Cinnamon  Bear; and so on to Mouse, who sat at Lion's left.    Lion spoke first. Lion said he wished man to have a terrible voice, like  himself, so that he could frighten all animals. He wanted man also to be  well covered with hair, with fangs in his claws, and very strong teeth.    Grizzly Bear laughed. He said it was ridiculous for any one to have such  a voice as Lion, because when he roared he frightened away the very prey  for which he was searching. But he said man should have very great  strength; that he should move silently, but very swiftly; and he should  be able to seize his prey without noise.    Buck said man would look foolish without antlers. And a terrible voice  was absurd, but man should have ears like a spider's web, and eyes like  fire.    Mountain Sheep said the branching antlers would bother man if he got  caught in a thicket. If man had horns rolled up, so that they were like  a stone on each side of his head, it would give his head weight enough  to butt very hard.    When it came Coyote's turn, he said the other animals were foolish  because they each wanted man to be just like themselves. Coyote was sure  he could make a man who would look better than Coyote himself, or any  other animal. Of course he would have to have four legs, with five  fingers. Man should have a strong voice, but he need not roar all the  time with it. And he should have feet nearly like Grizzly Bear's,  because he could then stand erect when he needed to. Grizzly Bear had no  tail, and man should not have any. The eyes and ears of Buck were good,  and perhaps man should have those. Then there was Fish, which had no  hair, and hair was a burden much of the year. So Coyote thought man  should not wear fur. And his claws should be as long as the Eagle's, so  that he could hold things in them. But no animal was as cunning and  crafty as Coyote, so man should have the wit of Coyote.    Then Beaver talked. Beaver said man would have to have a tail, but it  should be broad and flat, so he could haul mud and sand on it. Not a  furry tail, because they were troublesome on account of fleas.    Owl said man would be useless without wings.    But Mole said wings would be folly. Man would be sure to bump against  the sky. Besides, if he had wings and eyes both, he would get his eyes  burned out by flying too near the sun. But without eyes, he could burrow  in the soft, cool earth where he could be happy.    Mouse said man needed eyes so he could see what he was eating. And  nobody wanted to burrow in the damp earth. So the council broke up in a  quarrel.    Then every animal set to work to make a man according to his own ideas.  Each one took a lump of earth and modelled it just like himself. All but  Coyote, for Coyote began to make the kind of man he had talked of in the  council.    It was late when the animals stopped work and fell asleep. All but  Coyote, for Coyote was the cunningest of all the animals, and he stayed  awake until he had finished his model. He worked hard all night. When  the other animals were fast asleep he threw water on the lumps of earth,  and so spoiled the models of the other animals. But in the morning he  finished his own, and gave it life long before the others could finish  theirs. Thus man was made by Coyote.          The First Man And Woman  Nishinam (near Bear River, Cal.)    The first man created by Coyote was called Aikut. His wife was Yototowi.  But the woman grew sick and died. Aikut dug a grave for her close beside  his camp fire, for the Nishinam did not burn their dead then. All the  light was gone from his life. He wanted to die, so that he could follow  Yototowi, and he fell into a deep sleep.    There was a rumbling sound and the spirit of Yototowi arose from the  earth and stood beside him. He would have spoken to her, but she forbade  him, for when an Indian speaks to a ghost he dies. Then she turned away  and set out for the dance-house of ghosts. Aikut followed her. Together  they journeyed through a great, dark country, until they came to a river  which separated them from the Ghost-land. Over the river there was a  bridge of but one small rope, so small that hardly Spider could crawl  across it. Here the woman started off alone, but when Aikut stretched  out his arms, she returned. Then she started again over the bridge of  thread. And Aikut spoke to her, so that he died. Thus together they  journeyed to the Spirit-land.          Old Man Above and the Grizzlies  Shastika (Cal.)    Along time ago, while smoke still curled from the smoke hole of the  tepee, a great storm arose. The storm shook the tepee. Wind blew the  smoke down the smoke hole. Old Man Above said to Little Daughter: \"Climb  up to the smoke hole. Tell Wind to be quiet. Stick your arm out of the  smoke hole before you tell him.\" Little Daughter climbed up to the smoke  hole and put out her arm. But Little Daughter put out her head also. She  wanted to see the world. Little Daughter wanted to see the rivers and  trees, and the white foam on the Bitter Waters. Wind caught Little  Daughter by the hair. Wind pulled her out of the smoke hole and blew her  down the mountain. Wind blew Little Daughter over the smooth ice and the  great forests, down to the land of the Grizzlies. Wind tangled her hair  and then left her cold and shivering near the tepees of the Grizzlies.    Soon Grizzly came home. In those days Grizzly walked on two feet, and  carried a big stick. Grizzly could talk as people do. Grizzly laid down  the young elk he had killed and picked up Little Daughter. He took  Little Daughter to his tepee. Then Mother Grizzly warmed her by the  fire. Mother Grizzly gave her food to eat.    Soon Little Daughter married the son of Grizzly. Their children were not  Grizzlies. They were men. So the Grizzlies built a tepee for Little  Daughter and her children. White men call the tepee Little Shasta.    At last Mother Grizzly sent a son to Old Man Above. Mother Grizzly knew  that Little Daughter was the child of Old Man Above, but she was afraid.  She said: \"Tell Old Man Above that Little Daughter is alive.\"    Old Man Above climbed out of the smoke hole.

It took over 60 years for  the first 100,000 volumes to be added, but only 31 for the second, and  early in the present financial year the quarter-million mark was  passed, so that the third hundred thousand should only take 15 years.    Again the growth was not without its problems. As early as 1908 the  problem of housing the stock was again causing worry, but for a few  years it was solved by better arrangement of the shelving. By 1915 the  situation was again difficult and approval was given for the removal of  the Valuation Department from the attic, the provision of stairs, and  the adapting of the area as a stack room. This provided welcome relief,  but only for a short while until in 1926 the attic space over the main  reading room was shelved and provided a makeshift storeroom for books.    The next expansion came in 1933 when the committee rooms adjacent to  the main reading room were taken over and portion of the walls removed  to give an open area. In 1938 the Library took over the remainder of  the attic and portion of the first floor vacated by the Health  Department. Though other alterations were made to increase shelving, no  further space was taken over until 1950 when a further committee room  was given to the Library. About the same time earthquake risk and  alteration to the building caused the removal of books from a portion  of the attic to the basement where further space had been made  available. Other rooms have more recently been provided to store the  books and periodicals in the Library and constant ingenuity is  necessary to see that the most economical use is made of the area  available.    The reasons for the expansion of the Library can be found in the  increased interest in libraries generally, and in the increased vote  which resulted. The fund received L600 until 1920 when it was raised to  L800. It was reduced to L700 in 1922 and remained at that figure until  1929 when it was raised to L900, though it suffered the depression  cuts.    These amounts were not sufficient to adequately finance the purchase of  books needed for the service the Library was expected to give, and in  1938 the grant was once again raised, this time to L1,250. Further  increases were made in 1947 (L2,000), 1949 (L2,250), 1952 (L3,000), and  1955 (L4,500).    In addition there has been considerable expansion in the exchange  arrangements, Government publishing having increased considerably in  the United Kingdom and the United States. Arrangements for the exchange  of official publications with Australia were made in 1952, while during  1957 the Canadian Government made the General Assembly Library a select  depository for its publications.    Another source of material for the Library has been by gift either of  individual books or of collections. They have been many and varied, and  it is safe to say that the Library would not possess the wide variety  of stock it does had it not been for the kindness and generosity of  many donors.                                COPYRIGHT DEPOSIT    The Copyright Act has also provided the Library with an increasing  amount of material. Like so many other of the Library's activities,  this was foreshadowed in the days when James Collier was Librarian. In  his report for 1888, he suggested that the time was ripe for the  enacting of a Colonial Copyright Act. Whatever was done about this  there was one thing that ought to be done immediately and that was the  passing of a law making provision for the deposit of one copy of every  colonial publication in a central library, which library could only be  the Parliamentary Library.    A letter was written from the chairman of the Library Committee to the  Premier asking for instructions to be given to the Solicitor-General to  prepare a Copyright Act, but nothing was done. The matter was raised  again by the Acting Librarian in 1891 and 1894. In 1895 Mr W.  Hutchison, M.H.R. for Dunedin, introduced the Literary Copyright Act  requiring the deposit in the Library of two copies of works published  in New Zealand. Nothing came of the Bill, which was discharged, though  the Library Committee in welcoming it had, however, considered one copy  sufficient.    There the matter rested until 1903 when two vigorous supporters of the  Library, the Hon. R. McNab and the Hon. John Rigg, introduced the  General Assembly Library Bill requiring publishers to present two  copies of their books to the Library. The Bill passed without  difficulty and became law on 30 October 1903. Though there was some  argument whether the Act required the deposit of issues of periodicals,  the Act was generally welcomed, and increased the amount of New Zealand  material reaching the Library.    There has been little change in the provisions affecting deposit,  though the previous Act is no longer in force, and has been replaced by  section 52 of the Copyright Act 1913.    In the 55 years during which deposit has been required the Library has  taken its responsibility for preservation seriously and now possesses  thousands of volumes not only of books, but of newspapers, periodicals,  and pamphlets. In addition, every attempt has been made to obtain  material which for various reasons was not obtained at the time of  publication. While not by any means perfect, the New Zealand collection  of the Library is probably without equal.                                 THE LIBRARIANS    Mr Charles Wilson had a considerable interest in literature as such and  contributed a literary column to a Wellington weekly for many years.  Though he had an excellent knowledge of literature, library technique  generally in New Zealand was not at its best, and not all the work done  in the Library was of the highest standard.    He was responsible for further attempts to buy the more important New  Zealand books still missing from the Library and for housing them in  special cases where they were available for consultation but were not  permitted to leave the Library. From this has grown the special New  Zealand collection with its own rooms.    Mr Wilson introduced the present system of alternate weekly shifts for  the staff working nights. Previously the staff worked broken shifts  which meant that some often had \"all nighters\" without breaks and were  called on to make their appearance fairly early the following day. If  the House sits late, the present system relieves the night staff when  the House rises or at 8 a.m. and they are not required till 5.30 p.m.    Stocktaking was a major task of the staff. The Library did not possess  a shelf list and the system used was slow. It did, however, indicate  that constant vigilance was necessary--and still is--to prevent books  going astray.    Mr James continued as Assistant Librarian until 1923. His later years  were marked with frequent periods of illness which told on the standard  of his work.    Mr Wilson retired in March 1926 and his successor, Dr G. H. Scholefield,  O.B.E., commenced duties in May. He was even then the author of two  books on New Zealand and the Pacific and had been New Zealand Press  Association representative in London. For the next 22 years the Library  was under his care. Hampered by depression and war, the development of  the Library was not as rapid as it could have been.    The principal change in the Library during this time was probably in  the staff. Members of the staff, mostly in senior positions, had held  degrees, but generally they had not been recruited from university  graduates and had picked up such library technique as they could at  work. A university degree now became essential, and in addition,  outside studies of library science were favoured as being of value both  to the member of the staff and to the Library. Mr A. D. McIntosh, now  head of the Department of External Affairs, for example, was given  leave in 1932 after receiving a Carnegie grant to attend the Library  School at the University of Michigan.    Dr Scholefield was also responsible for the introduction of women to  the staff. Though a Mrs North had been employed as a clerk for six  months in 1900, the hours of duty had made the Library a man's world.  In 1926 Miss Q. B. Cowles, from the Turnbull Library, was the first of  the many young ladies who since then have been members of the staff.    The other change was in the reference service. The Library came to be  called on more and more for research and information. These calls came  not only from members of Parliament, but also from Government  Departments and from the public. The staff naturally had to be more  highly trained to carry out these tasks and had to spend more time to  answer the inquiries. After Mr McIntosh's return the reference staff  was reorganised and a collection of quick reference books made. In  addition, not only did the staff carry out research but it began to  summarise and rewrite the results of its research ready for immediate  use by honourable members.    Dr Scholefield, with his keen interest in biography, was instrumental  in obtaining for the Library many collections of personal papers of New  Zealand statesmen. Among these are the papers of Sir John Hall, William  Rolleston, and Sir Julius Vogel, not to mention the wonderful papers  written and collected by the Richmond and Atkinson families over nearly  50 years. These documents are already proving valuable to political and  historical scholars.    Dr Scholefield was also Controller of Dominion Archives and for some  years these were housed in the Library. During his period as Chief  Librarian, in addition to several editions of _Who's Who in New  Zealand_, Dr Scholefield published his monumental _Dictionary of New  Zealand Biography_ and two other works of biography.    On his retirement in October 1947 Dr Scholefield was succeeded by Mr W.  S. Wauchop, M.A., who had joined the staff in 1924 as Assistant Chief  Librarian. Freed from the restraints "]]]
