Until an eve when lone he went,      Gnawing his beard in dreariment,        Lo! from a thicket hidden,          Lovely as flower          In April hour,        Steps forth a form unbidden.        'Get ye now down, Lord Aerie,      I'm troubled so I'm like to dee,'        She cries, 'twixt joy and grief, O;          'The hound is dead,          When all is said,        But love is past belief, O.        'Nights, nights I've lain your lands to see,      Forlorn and still--and all for me,        All for a foolish curse, O;          Now here am I          Come out to die,        To live unlov'd is worse, O!'        In faith, this lord, in that lone dale,      Hears now a sweeter nightingale,        And lairs a tend'rer deer, O;          His sorrow goes          Like mountain snows        In waters sweet and clear, O!        Let the hound bay in Shadowland,      Tuning his ear to understand        What voice hath tamed this Aerie;          Chafe, chafe he may          The stag all day,        And never thirst nor weary.        Now here he smells, now there he smells,      Winding his voice along the dells,        Till grey flows up the morn, O;          Then hies again          To Lady Jane,        No longer now forlorn, O.        Ay, as it were a bud, did break      To loveliness for Aerie's sake,        So she in beauty moving          Rides at his hand          Across his land,        Beloved as well as loving.              AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING          As Lucy went a-walking one wintry morning fine,      There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:      Then 'O!' said Lucy, in the snow, 'it's very plain to see      A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'        Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,      And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:      And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place      All stretched by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.        She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees      A little well of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;      Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,      And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.        But when the belfry ceased to sound yet nothing could she see,      Save only frozen water in the shadow of the tree.      But presently she lifted up her eyes along the snow,      And sees a witch in brindled shawl a-frisking to and fro.        Her shoes were buckled scarlet that capered to and fro,      And all her rusty locks were wreathed with twisted mistletoe;      But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,      Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she          lissomely.        It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;      It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tost;      It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:      'Nay!' Lucy said, 'it is the wind that through the branches flows.'        And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,      And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,      And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before,      And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four.        'O! who are ye,' sweet Lucy cries, 'that in a dreadful ring,      All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?'      'A witch and witches, one and nine,' they straight to her reply,      And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.        Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,      And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;      She smells all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair,      And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.        Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,      With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;      And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,      And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.        'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!      Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'      But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,      Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;        Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,      Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,      Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,      But like a dream which vanishes, so vanished were they all.        When Lucy sees, and only sees, three crows upon a bough,      And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,      Then 'O!' said Lucy, 'three times three is nine--I plainly see      Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'              THE ENGLISHMAN          I met a sailor in the woods,        A silver ring wore he,      His hair hung black, his eyes shone blue,        And thus he said to me:--        'What country, say, of this round earth,        What shore of what salt sea,      Be this, my son, I wander in,        And looks so strange to me?'        Says I, 'O foreign sailorman,        In England now you be,      This is her wood, and this her sky,        And that her roaring sea.'        He lifts his voice yet louder,        'What smell be this,' says he,      'My nose on the sharp morning air        Snuffs up so greedily?'        Says I, 'It is wild roses        Do smell so winsomely,      And winy briar too,' says I,        'That in these thickets be.'        'And oh!' says he, 'what leetle bird        Is singing in yon high tree,      So every shrill and long-drawn note        Like bubbles breaks in me?'        Says I, 'It is the mavis        That perches in the tree,      And sings so shrill, and sings so sweet,        When dawn comes up the sea.'        At which he fell a-musing,        And fixed his eye on me,      As one alone 'twixt light and dark        A spirit thinks to see        'England!' he whispers soft and harsh,        'England!' repeated he,      'And briar, and rose, and mavis,        A-singing in yon high tree.        'Ye speak me true, my leetle son,        So--so, it came to me,      A-drifting landwards on a spar,        And grey dawn on the sea.        'Ay, ay, I could not be mistook;        I knew them leafy trees,      I knew that land so witcherie sweet,        And that old noise of seas.        'Though here I've sailed a score of years,        And heard 'em, dream or wake,      Lap small and hollow 'gainst my cheek,        On sand and coral break;        '\"Yet now, my leetle son,\" says I,        A-drifting on the wave,      \"That land I see so safe and green        Is England, I believe.        '\"And that there wood is English wood,        And this here cruel sea,      The selfsame old blue ocean        Years gone remembers me,        \"A-sitting with my bread and butter        Down ahind yon chitterin' mill;      And this same Marinere\"--(that's me),        \"Is that same leetle Will!--        \"That very same wee leetle Will        Eating his bread and butter there,      A-looking on the broad blue sea        Betwixt his yaller hair!\"        'And here be I, my son, throwed up        Like corpses from the sea,      Ships, stars, winds, tempests, pirates past,        Yet leetle Will I be!'        He said no more, that sailorman,        But in a reverie      Stared like the figure of a ship        With painted eyes to sea.              THE PHANTOM          'Upstairs in the large closet, child,        This side the blue-room door,      Is an old Bible, bound in leather,        Standing upon the floor;        'Go with this taper, bring it me;        Carry it on your arm;      It is the book on many a sea        Hath stilled the waves' alarm.'        Late the hour, dark the night,        The house is solitary,      Feeble is a taper's light        To light poor Ann to see.        Her eyes are yet with visions bright        Of sylph and river, flower and fay,      Now through a narrow corridor        She takes her lonely way.        Vast shadows on the heedless walls        Gigantic loom, stoop low:      Each little hasty footfall calls        Hollowly to and fro.        In the dim solitude her heart        Remembers tearlessly      White winters when her mother was        Her loving company.        Now in the dark clear glass she sees        A taper mocking hers,--      A phantom face of light blue eyes,        Reflecting phantom fears.        Around her loom the vacant rooms,        Wind the upward stairs,      She climbs on into a loneliness        Only her taper shares.        Her grandmother is deaf with age;        A garden of moonless trees      Would answer not though she should cry        In anguish on her knees.        So that she scarcely heeds--so fast        Her pent-up heart doth beat--      When, faint along the corridor,        Falleth the sound of feet:--        Sounds lighter than silk slippers make        Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet      Violin and 'cello wake        Music for twirling feet.        O! in an old unfriendly house,        What shapes may not conceal      Their faces in the open day,        At night abroad to steal?        Even her taper seems with fear        To languish small and blue;      Far in the woods the winter wind        Runs whistling through.        A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,        Her mouth is stretched to cry,      But sudden, with a gush of joy,        It narrows to a sigh.        It is a wilding child which comes        Swift through the corridor,      Singing an old forgotten song,        This ancient burden bore:--        'Thorn, thorn, I wis,      And roses twain,        A red rose and a white,      Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],[0,"The Children's Bible (#5)"],[1," and, as he looked  up, three men stood there before him. As soon as he saw them, he ran  from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed to the ground and  said, \"Sirs, if you are willing to do me a favor, do not, I beg of you,  pass by your servant. Since you have come to your servant, let a little  water be brought, that you may wash your feet, and lie down under the  tree. And let me bring some food, that you may refresh yourselves;  afterward you may go on your way.\" They replied, \"Do as you have said.\"    So Abraham hastened to Sarah's tent and said, \"Make ready quickly four  measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.\" Abraham also ran to  the herd, and took a calf that was tender and good, and gave it to the  servant, and he prepared it quickly. Then Abraham took curd and milk,  with the calf which he had prepared, and served them; and he waited on  them under the tree, while they ate.    Then they said to him, \"Where is your wife?\" He said, \"There, within the  tent.\" One of them said, \"I will surely return to you about nine months  from now, and then, Sarah your wife shall have a son.\"      LOT'S ESCAPE FROM A WICKED CITY    And Abraham went along with them to start them on their way. Jehovah  said, \"The complaint has come that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah have  committed great and terrible sins. I will go down and see whether they  have done exactly as the complaint comes to me; and if they have not, I  will know.\"    Then the men turned from there and looked off in the direction of Sodom.    Then Abraham drew near to Jehovah and said, \"Wilt thou sweep away the  righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are within the city fifty  people who are righteous. Wilt thou sweep away and not spare the place  for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from thee to do this:  to slay the righteous with the wicked! And that the righteous should be  treated as the wicked, far be it from thee! Shall not the Judge of all  the earth do what is just?\" Jehovah said, \"If I find in the city of  Sodom fifty who are righteous, I will spare the whole place for their  sake.\" Abraham answered, \"I have dared to speak to Jehovah, even though  I am but dust and ashes. Suppose there be five lacking of the fifty  righteous. Wilt thou sweep away all the city for lack of five?\" Jehovah  said, \"I will not sweep it away, if I find forty-five there.\"    Then Abraham spoke to him again, and said, \"Suppose forty are found  there?\" He replied, \"For the sake of forty I will not do it.\" Then  Abraham said, \"Oh, let not Jehovah be angry, but let me speak. Suppose  thirty are found there?\" He answered, \"I will not do it, if I find  thirty there.\" Then Abraham said, \"Thou seest that I have dared to speak  to Jehovah. Suppose twenty are found there?\" He replied, \"For the sake  of twenty I will not destroy it.\" Then Abraham said, \"Oh, let not  Jehovah be angry, but let me speak just once more. Suppose ten are found  there?\" And he said, \"For the sake of the ten I will not destroy it.\"  Then Jehovah went his way, and Abraham returned home.    Two angels in human form came to Sodom in the evening, as Lot was  sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up to meet  them, and he bowed with his face to the earth and said, \"Sirs, turn  aside, I beg of you, into your servant's house and spend the night and  wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way.\" They  said, \"No, we will spend the night in the street.\" But he urged them so  strongly that they went with him and entered his house. And he made a  feast for them and baked bread made without yeast, and they ate.    But before they had lain down, the people of Sodom, both young and old,  all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. And they called  out to Lot, \"Where are the men who came in to you to-night? Bring them  out to us that we may do to them what we desire.\"    Then Lot went out to them at the entrance of his house, but he shut the  door after him. And he said, \"I beg of you, my friends, do not do what  is wrong. Do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shadow  of my roof.\" But they replied, \"Stand back, or we will treat you worse  than them.\" And they pressed hard against Lot and advanced to break the  door. But the men reached out and drew Lot to them into the house and  shut the door. Then they smote the men who were at the door of the  house, both small and great, with blindness, so that they grew tired of  searching for the door.    Then the men said to Lot, \"Have you any one else here? Bring your  sons-in-law, your sons, and daughters, and whoever you have in the city  out of this place, for we are about to destroy it, because great  complaint concerning the people has come to Jehovah and he has sent us  to destroy it.\" So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, \"Up, go out  of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city.\" But his sons-in-law  thought he was only jesting.    When the dawn appeared, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Get up, take your  wife and your two daughters that you may not be swept away in the  punishment of the city.\" When he hesitated, the men took him by the hand  and led him and his wife and his two daughters outside the city, for  Jehovah was merciful to him.    When they had brought them outside, they said, \"Run for your life; do  not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the  heights, that you may not be swept away!\" But Lot said to them, \"Oh,  sirs, not so! See, your servant has found favor with you, and you have  shown great mercy to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the  heights, lest some evil overtake me, and I die. See now, this village is  near enough to run to, and it is small. Oh, let me escape there, and my  life will be saved.\" Jehovah said to him, \"I have also granted you this  favor, in that I will not destroy the village of which you have spoken.  Make haste, escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.\"    The sun had risen when Lot came to Zoar. Then Jehovah caused brimstone  and fire from heaven to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and he destroyed  those cities and all the plain, with all the people who lived in it and  all that grew on the ground. But Lot's wife, who was following him,  looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.    Early in the morning Abraham rose and went to the place where he had  stood before Jehovah; and as he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and  all the plain, he saw the smoke of the land going up as the smoke of a  smelting-furnace.      GOD'S CARE FOR THE BOY ISHMAEL    Jehovah remembered what he had told Sarah, and he did as he had  promised. So Sarah had a son, and when the child grew up, Abraham made a  great feast on the day that he was weaned. But Sarah saw the son of  Hagar the Egyptian and of Abraham playing with her son Isaac. And she  said to Abraham, \"Drive out this slave girl and her son, for the son of  this slave girl shall not be heir with my son Isaac.\" This request was  very displeasing to Abraham because the boy was his son. But Jehovah  said to Abraham, \"Do not be displeased because of the boy and because of  your slave girl. Listen to all that Sarah says to you, for Isaac only  and his children shall bear your name. But I will also make of the son  of the slave girl a great nation, because he is your son.\"    Then Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of  water and gave it to Hagar; and he put the boy upon her shoulder and  sent her away. So she set out and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.  When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under one of the  desert shrubs and went a short distance away and sat down opposite him,  for she said, \"Let me not see the child die.\"    While she sat there, the boy began to cry; and Jehovah heard the cry of  the boy, and said, \"What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for Jehovah has  heard the cry of the boy. Rise, lift him up, and hold him fast by the  hand, for I will make him a great nation.\" And Jehovah opened her eyes  and she saw a well of water. Then she went and filled the skin with  water and gave the boy a drink.    And Jehovah cared for the boy; and when he grew up, he lived in the  wilderness of Paran and became a bowman. And his mother secured a wife  for him from Egypt.      ABRAHAM'S LOYALTY TO GOD    Later Jehovah tested Abraham, saying to him, \"Abraham\"; and he answered,  \"Here am I.\" Jehovah said, \"Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you  love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a  burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.\"    [Illustration: (C) _Curtis Publishing Company_    _Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness_ Painted by W. L. Taylor]    So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of  his servants with him, and his son Isaac. When he had split the wood for  the burnt-offering, he set out for the place of which God had told him.  On the third day, when Abraham looked up and saw the place in the  distance, he said to his servants, \"Stay here with the ass, while I and  the lad go over there. When we have worshipped, we will come back to  you.\"    Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac,  his son. And he took the fire and the knife, and they both went on  together. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, \"My father!\"  and Abraham answered, \"Yes, my son.\" Isaac said, \"Here is the fire and  the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?\" Abraham answered,  \"My son, God will himself provide a lamb for a burnt-offering.\" So the  two went on together.    When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the  altar there and laid the wood on it and bound Isaac his son and laid him  on the altar upon the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand, and took  the knife to kill his son. But the angel of Jehovah called to him from  heaven, saying, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" and"]]]
