Even Franklin would appear  dingy beside it. She gazed appreciatively at the high ceiling and the  shining oak wainscotings of the wide corridor through which she was  passing. When her guide, who was tall, thin and plain of face, opened  the last door on the right and ushered her into a beautiful sunshiny  office which seemed more like a living-room than a place wherein  business was transacted, Marjorie uttered an involuntary, \"Oh, how  lovely!\"    \"Yes, isn't it though,\" returned the tall girl. \"This is Miss Archer's  own idea, and, so far, it's proving a brilliant success. That is, we all  think so. Is Miss Archer in her private office?\" she asked the young  woman who had risen from her desk near the door and came forward to  receive them.    Marjorie would have liked to ask her new acquaintance what she meant,  but at that moment a door at the farther end of the room opened and a  stately, black-haired woman, with just a suspicion of gray at her  temples, emerged. She turned a pair of grave, deep-set eyes upon the  tall girl and said, pleasantly: \"Well, Ellen, what can I do for you this  morning?\"    \"Oh, Miss Archer!\" exclaimed the tall girl, eagerly, with an impulsive  step forward, \"you haven't forbidden basketball this year, have you?  Stella and I couldn't believe our ears when we heard it this morning!\"  It was evident that the impetuous Ellen was on the best possible terms  with her principal.    \"I don't remember having issued an order to that effect,\" smiled Miss  Archer. \"Where did you hear that bit of news?\"    Ellen Seymour's plain face flushed, then paled. \"It was just a rumor,\"  she replied with reluctance. \"I'd rather not mention names. Still, when  I heard it, I could not rest until I had asked you. The sophomores hope  to do something wonderful this year. We couldn't bear to believe for a  minute that there would be no basketball. We had planned to have a  tryout some day this week, after school. I'm so glad,\" she added  fervently. \"Thank you, Miss Archer. Oh, pardon me,\" she turned to  Marjorie, \"this is Miss Archer, our principal. Miss Archer, this young  lady wishes to see you. I met her in the corridor downstairs and  volunteered my services as guide.\"    With a courteous nod to Marjorie, the tall girl left the room and the  principal turned her attention toward the prospective freshman.    At the calm, kindly inquiry of the gray eyes Marjorie's feeling of  shyness vanished, and she said in her most soldierly manner, as though  speaking to her mother: \"Miss Archer, my name is Marjorie Dean, and I  wish to enter the freshman class of Sanford High School. We moved to  Sanford from the city of B----. We have been here just a week. I was a  freshman in Franklin High School at B----.\"    Miss Archer took the young girl's hand in hers. Her rather stern face  was lighted with a welcoming smile. Marjorie's direct speech and frank,  honest eyes had pleased the older woman.    \"I am glad to know that we are to have a new pupil,\" she said cordially.  \"The freshman class is smaller than usual this year. So many girls leave  school when their grammar school course is finished. I wish we could  persuade these mothers and fathers to let their daughters have at least  a year of high school. It would help them so much in whatever kind of  work they elected to do later.\"    \"That is what mother says,\" returned Marjorie, quickly. \"My mother  intended to come with me to-day, but was unable to do so.\" She did not  go into details. Young as she was, Marjorie had a horror of discussing  her personal affairs with a stranger. \"She will call upon you later.\"    \"I shall be pleased to meet your mother,\" Miss Archer made courteous  answer. \"The first and most important matter to be considered this  morning is your class standing. Let me see. B---- is in the same state as  the town of Sanford. I believe the system of credits is the same in all  the high schools throughout this state, as the examinations come from  the state board at the capital. What studies had you begun at B----?\"    \"English composition, algebra, physiology, American history and French,\"  recited Marjorie, dutifully.    Miss Archer raised her eyebrows. \"You are ambitious. We usually allow  our pupils to carry only four subjects.\"    \"But these are quite easy subjects,\" pleaded Marjorie; \"that is, all  except algebra. I am not especially clever in mathematics. I am obliged  to study very hard to make good recitations. Still, I should like to  continue with the subjects I have begun. Won't you try me until the end  of the first term?\" she added, a coaxing note in her voice.    \"I will at least try you for a week or two. Then if I find that you are  not overtaxing your strength you may go on with them.\"    \"Thank you.\" Marjorie's relieved tone caused the principal to smile  again. It was not usual for a pupil to show concern over the prospect of  losing a subject. Many of the students rebelled at having to carry four  subjects.    \"Have you your grammar school certificate with you?\" asked Miss Archer,  the smile giving way to a businesslike expression.    Marjorie handed the principal the large envelope she had been carrying.  Miss Archer drew forth a square of thick white paper, ornamented with  the red seal by which the state board of school commissioners had  signified their approval of Marjorie Dean and her work in the grammar  school.    The older woman read it carefully. \"Yes, this is, as I thought the same  form of certificate. From this moment on you are a freshman in Sanford  High School, Miss Dean. I trust that you will be happy here. Sanford has  the reputation of being one of the finest schools in the state. I am  going to assign you to a seat in the study hall at once. Miss Merton is  in charge there. She will give you a printed form of our curriculum of  study. School opens at nine o'clock in the morning. The morning session  lasts until twelve o'clock. We have an hour and a quarter for luncheon,  and our last recitation for the day is over at half past three o'clock.  We have devotional exercises in the chapel on Monday and Friday  mornings, and the course in gymnastics is optional. There are, of  course, many other things regarding the regulations of the school which  you will gradually come to know.\"    \"Miss Arnold,\" the thin-faced, sharp-eyed young woman, who had been  covertly appraising Marjorie during her talk with Miss Archer, came  languidly forward. \"This is Miss Dean.\" The two girls bowed rather  distantly. Marjorie had conceived an instant and violent dislike for  this lynx-eyed stranger. \"Take Miss Dean to the locker room, then to  Miss Merton. Say to Miss Merton that Miss Dean is a freshman, and that I  wish her assigned to a desk in the freshman section.\"    With a last glance of pleasant approval, which Marjorie's pretty face,  dainty attire and frank, yet modest bearing had evoked, the principal  retired to her inner office, and Marjorie obediently followed her guide,  who, without speaking, set off down the corridor at almost unnecessary  speed. \"This way,\" she directed curtly as they reached the main  corridor. They passed down the corridor, descended a second stairway and  brought up directly in front of long rows of lockers. Within five  minutes Marjorie's hat had been put away, and she had received a locker  key. This done, her companion hurried her upstairs and down the wide  corridor through which they had first come.    Then she suddenly opened a door, and Marjorie found herself in an  enormous square room, which contained row upon row of shining oak desks,  occupied by what seemed to her hundreds of pupils. In reality there were  not more than two hundred and forty persons in the room, but in the eyes  of the little stranger everything was quadrupled. How different it was  from Franklin! So this was the study hall, one of the things on which  the school prided itself. In front of the rows of desks was one large  desk on a small raised platform, reminding Marjorie of an island in the  midst of a sea. At the desk sat a small, gray-haired woman, who peered  suspiciously over her glasses at Marjorie as she was lifelessly  introduced by Miss Arnold.    \"I don't like _her_ at all,\" was the young girl's inward comment as she  walked behind the stiff, uncompromising, black-clothed back to a desk  almost in the middle of the last row of seats on the east side. But  Marjorie experienced a little shiver of delight as she seated herself,  for directly in front of her, and gazing at her with reassuring, smiling  eyes, was the Picture Girl.          CHAPTER V    GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE PICTURE GIRL      \"Welcome to Sanford,\" whispered the girl, \"and to the freshman class. I  was sure when I saw you the other day you couldn't be anything other  than a freshman.\"    Marjorie flushed, then smiled faintly. \"I didn't think any of the girls  would remember me,\" she confessed.    \"Oh, I remember you perfectly. You were across the street from school on  three different days, weren't you?\"    Marjorie nodded. \"I just had to come down and get acquainted with the  outside of the school. I was awfully curious about it.\"    \"Miss Harding,\" a cold voice at their elbows caused both girls to start.  So intent had they been on their conversation that they had not noticed  Miss Merton's approach, \"you may answer any questions Miss Dean wishes  to ask regarding our course of study here as set forth in our  curriculum.\" She laid a closely printed sheet of paper before Marjorie.  \"This does not mean, however, the personal conversation in which, I am  sorry to say, you appeared to be engrossed when I approached. Remember,  Miss Dean, that personal conversation will neither be excused nor  tolerated in the study hall. I trust I shall not have to remind you of  this again.\"    Marjorie watched with unseeing eyes the angular form of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#5)"],[1,"hardships and  adventures, which, considering the courage and suffering of that little  band of youths who knelt before him, was little less than cruelty.    Despairing now, and worn out with what they had endured, they were  forced to obey the Pope's decree, and so with shattered hopes and  dreams of glory for ever abandoned, they retraced their steps, and  found their pathway homeward far more trying than the rest of their  journey had been.    Many of them died on the way, and of those who lived, it was said in  towns and cities through which they passed, that where in departing  they passed in parties and troops, happy and never without the song of  cheer, they now returned in silence, barefoot and hungry, and with no  band of followers.    Day by day they straggled into Cologne--victims of a sad delusion.  Alas, how bitterly they had paid for their wilful disobedience!    When asked where they had been, they said they did not know, and had  only wild confused tales to tell of strange lands and countries,  costumes and customs, and many a mother's heart was broken with sorrow  that her boy had not survived the journeying.    Winter had passed and Spring had come and gone before all the wanderers  had returned, all the lost been given up, and for many a year to come,  peasants and nobles, with tear-dimmed eyes told the story of the German  children's march to the sea, and of the supposed martyrdom of their  lost leader, Nicholas--whose father, the afflicted parents whose homes  had been desolated by the Crusade, turned on in such a frenzy of  bitterness and anger, feeling that he had strongly influenced his son  to leadership that they laid violent hands on him and hanged him in  revenge.    Meanwhile, during all the weeks while Nicholas and his army were  marching southward on their way to Italy, Stephen was still preaching  at St. Denys, and his young lieutenants were still gathering recruits  for his army from all parts of France--but at length in late June, all  was ready except the last preparations for departure, and Stephen then  sent out a command to his forces to gather at Vendome, a city near  Cloyes, which was not only one of considerable importance, but from  which roads lay in many directions from which bands could arrive.    From that moment every day some new band came into Vendome with a young  leader in command, and was loudly welcomed by the other waiting bands;  while coming across the plains, other groups could be seen marching  towards the city, with their flags and oriflammes waving high, and  their crosses held higher yet. As they drew near the city their songs  could be heard louder and louder until when they reached the city  gates, the words were so distinct that their dialect disclosed the  province from which they had come.    From every province in France they came, bringing with them their  different languages, costumes and peculiarities, and consequently,  there was great confusion and variety in the ranks of Stephen's army,  but though their dialects and costumes varied greatly, the youths were  bound together by a single hope, led by a common aim, as they marched  into Vendome ready to start on their perilous journey.    Like the German youths, they were assured that no vessels would be  needed to take them across the Mediterranean, for had not Stephen said:    \"Between waters which are to be to us as a wall on the right hand and  the left, are we to cross the untrodden bed of the sea and with dry  feet will we stand on the distant beach by the walls of Acre or of  Tripoli. We bear no weapons and we wear no armour! The pathway of other  Crusaders may be marked by the stain of blood and the glitter of steel,  but our pilgrims' robes are our armour, our crosses are our swords and  our hymns shall time our march!\"    Not all wore the Crusader's grey coat, but all wore the Cross which was  made of muslin cloth and sewed on the right shoulder of the coat. To  place the cross there was the duty of the prophets--as the young  leaders of each band were called. Receiving the cross was the formal  act of enlistment, and proud indeed were the lads who wore them.    At last the latest band had come to Vendome, and fully thirty thousand  children were gathered together there, eagerly awaiting the command to  start on their journey. What a sight that was, the army of children as  they stood waiting for the command to march!    Pleading parents and weeping friends begged the youths to repent and  stay at home where their duty lay, but pleas and cries were all  counteracted by applause and encouragement from thoughtless  enthusiasts, and after religious exercises in which God's blessing was  asked, and the oriflammes and crosses raised triumphantly, the army  formed in line of march, and then with a volume of cheers which drowned  the sound of sobs and protests, moved on, out of Vendome under the  protection and leadership of Stephen.    It was only a few weeks since the young prophet had been the humble  shepherd lad of Cloyes, but that was forgotten now, and as he led his  army from Vendome he had assumed a pomp and dignity quite out of  harmony with the appearance of his army. A leader of such a mighty host  must not walk, so Stephen rode. The Lord's own general and prophet must  assume the style which became his rank. He therefore rode in a chariot  as splendid as could be procured, covered with rare carpets of  brilliant colours. Over his head to protect him from the heat of the  sun was a canopy from which there hung draperies of every hue. Around  this chariot to guard him and carry out his commands, as well as to add  to the impressiveness of his station, rode a band of chosen youths of  noble birth, on chargers, dressed in splendid uniforms and armed with  lances and spears. This pomp and splendour increased the confidence of  his followers, who, too young to see the inconsistency of his conduct,  listened to his words as to those of God, and regarded his wishes as  law.    Out of Vendome, amid songs and shouts and tears and applause of the  crowd gathered to see the departure, moved the ranks of youths, their  eyes dazzled with the wonder and the glory of the leader--their hearts  on fire to do his bidding. And in Stephen there burned the zeal of the  real leader. In order to keep up the spirit of the host, which fatigue  would tend to lessen, he spoke to them often in stirring words. At  morning or noon or evening when they halted or encamped and also while  they marched, he leaned often from his chariot and spoke encouraging  words. Sometimes they thronged around him so closely when he spoke that  it was hard work for his guards to protect him from the consequences of  their weak homage and as they pushed forward to be near him, many of  the weak and small were crushed to death. The veneration for the Boy  Prophet was carried to such an extent that all vied with each other to  procure a thread of his clothing, a piece of the trappings of his car,  while they who had a single hair of his head felt they had a priceless  treasure. It is small wonder that this shepherd boy, sensitive as he  was to impressions, and duped as he was in the belief that he was  anointed by God to a holy calling, and then worshipped by an  ever-increasing tide of followers, should have been affected by the  rapid change in his circumstances and surroundings. He was evidently  possessed of no slight ability to carry out plans, and had much power  over people, and his whole nature was aflame with the emotional  credulous piety of the Middle Ages. Such was the lad Stephen, shepherd  of Cloyes, prophet of the Children's Crusade, when with pomp and  ceremony he led his army out of Vendome.    The pathway of his army was marked by far fewer hardships than those  the German children were encountering, for the country through which  they travelled was more peopled and the distance they had to go much  shorter. They did not have to sleep on rocky heights or on freezing  moors, and in the lands through which they passed they encountered only  sympathy and interest. So their ranks were scarcely thinned by  desertion or death, and yet even so, the trip was none too easy,  especially on account of the great heat and drought of the summer, to  which Stephen constantly referred as a sure sign from God that the sea  was to be dried up for their benefit as he had predicted.    His army did not bear heat, want and exhaustion as well as the sturdier  German children did, and in an incredibly short time its ranks lost all  discipline and authority, and at last each one of his band of followers  became keen only to outwit the others in a search for food, and in  endeavours to hide it, they struggled on--a loose, undisciplined mass,  until finally Stephen's authority was entirely lost and the march  became only a race for the sea. All original enthusiasm of the army had  vanished, and the courage which for a while had been kept up by  Stephen's zeal, and by spirited songs and stories, died away, and  Stephen was obliged to make use of constant deceptions in answer to  questions as to when the weary march would be over, saying that a few  more days or hours would bring them to the sea, and so ignorant of  geography were the youths that the falsehoods were not detected. Day by  day they awoke with fresh hope which was fed by the sight of a castle  or walled town which they thought might be Jerusalem, and night after  night they lay down victims of a cruel deception--poor deluded, wilful,  little pilgrims! On and on they marched through central France, through  Burgundy, and beautiful Provence, and finally from the last range of  hills they had to climb, there burst on them a view of the cool, blue  sea, and from their ranks there came a mighty cheer! With renewed hope  they hurried down to the walls of the city of Marseilles which they saw  lying below the hills, an enchanting vision of cool green beauty to  their"]]]
