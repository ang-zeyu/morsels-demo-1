It was thus that the congregation of the  Index took action and published its decree a week later.    In 1633 Galileo, having continued to propagate his views, was called on by  the Inquisition to retract and abjure, and the formal notice to him to do  so states expressly that the declaration of 1616 was made by the Pope  himself, and that resistance to it was, therefore, heresy, contrary to the  doctrine of the Catholic and Apostolic Church. On being brought to trial,  Galileo made a formal abjuration, and on June 30th Pope Urban VIII.  ordered the publication of the sentence, thereby, according to Roman  ecclesiastical law, making Galileo's compulsory denial of the earth's  motion binding on all Christians as a theological doctrine. Infidels have  a vast deal to say about such an abominable manifestation of ecclesiastic  tyranny and unscientific and unscriptural nonsense. All intelligent Roman  Catholics of to-day reject the judgment of Popes Paul IV. and Urban VIII.  as absurd, and scientifically and scripturally false. There is not so much  as a hint at papal authority found in the three old creeds known as the  Apostles', the Nicene and the Athanasian, nor in any ancient gloss upon  them. Neither can we find in them any of the distinguishing special  doctrines of the Church of Rome.    Christianity came from the hands of Christ and his apostles in all its  perfections, and as long as infidels stop short of the New Testament  itself, and short of Christ and his apostles, in their warfare, we may  well believe that all their efforts to blot out Christianity will be vain.  Protestants themselves have demurred as much as infidels against the  errors of the Roman Catholic Church, and fully as much against the errors  of each other as denominations. \"Truth stands true to her God, man alone  deviates.\"    The greatest difficulty that Christianity ever encountered is the  ignorance and imperfections of its own friends. Protestant errors are many  and serious. But why should the genuine be discarded on account of the  existence of the counterfeit? And why should we shut our eyes to the  importance of the great work of establishing truth, to the destruction of  all Catholic and Protestant errors of faith and practice by becoming the  advocates of false charity through the adoption of \"broad-gauge religion,\"  in a \"broad-gauge church?\" Infidels who, like Col. Ingersoll, assert that  \"no man can control his belief,\" had better look in a glass and see  themselves as others see them, before they _strive to_ conquer a victory  for the _black __ demon_ of despair, by fastening the absurd philosophy of  _fatalism_ upon all the world. If men can not help their belief, who is to  blame? Surely, neither Roman Catholics, nor Protestants, nor those who  managed \"thumbscrews\" and \"hot irons,\" and other condemned instruments of  the dark ages, nor yet those who now live to be the \"butt\" of Colonel  Ingersoll's satire and ridicule. A kind feeling for all, and  unfaithfulness to the truth--never!            PAPAL AUTHORITY IN THE BYGONE.--THE INFIDEL'S AMUSING ATTITUDE.      The doctrine of papal infallibility amounts to this: that the decisions of  the Pope on faith and morals, being divinely inspired and infallible, are,  when placed upon record, so much more holy Scripture. This infallibility  dogma has been a great source of mischief and of unbelief. It has  accomplished no good, but a great deal of harm. Some Roman theologians  claim that the Popes have _only once_, up to the present time, spoken with  the formalities necessary to make their utterances \"_ex cathedra_\" and  infallibly binding, and that was when Pius the Ninth, on December 8, 1854,  decreed the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary; which, if true,  belongs to the realm of unpractical speculation. It was denied as heresy  by orthodox Catholics, including _fourteen Popes_, for a thousand years,  and is contrary to the well-nigh \"unanimous consent of the fathers.\" _See  Dr. Pusey, Letter 1, to Newman, pp. 72-286._ To use such an engine but  once in all the centuries, and then to accomplish so little, aside from  furnishing infidels with something to say, is much like constructing a  vessel of twenty thousand tons capacity to carry one man across the  Atlantic. There is such a thing as Parthenogenesis known in nature. The  Vatican decrees declare that the Christian religion came perfect from  God's hands; that it is not like a human science, such as medicine or  mechanics, which can be improved or altered by the skill of man. In view  of this conceded fact we have no kind of use for the decree of Pius the  Ninth upon the \"miraculous conception\"--\"Pope Pius decreed it.\" Well, well,  if Christianity really stood in need of such a decree it would not have  been left off until December 8, 1854. It has been a bone for infidels to  contend over from that time to the present. The New Testament is not  responsible for it.    Men of sense, who are not already traditionized nor Christianized, find  facts enough in the line of papal bulls and decrees to disgust them so  thoroughly as to drive them at once to reject religion entirely. Sixtus  the V., in 1590, declared, by a perpetual decree, an edition of the  Vulgate, just then out, the sole authentic and standard text, to be  received as such under pain of excommunication. He also decreed that  future editions not conformed to it should have no credit nor authority.  But its errors were so numerous that it was immediately called in, and a  new Vulgate was published by Clement VIII., in 1592, differing, in several  thousand places, from the one of 1590. This last publication was also  issued under penalty of excommunication for any departure from it. So  Roman Catholic faith rests very largely upon the assumed authority of the  Pope, and this authority has often been exercised in the wrong, they  themselves being witnesses. This authority, opposed to human progress, has  been and is one of the greatest feeders to Atheism and infidelity. Mr.  Draper, in his work entitled \"Conflict between Religion and Science,\"  wishes his readers to understand that he uses the term Christianity in the  sense of Roman Catholicism. The entire work is one grand scientific effort  against popecraft and priestcraft. His work is well worth a reading; but  it is to be remembered by all who would do Mr. Draper justice that his  great antagonist is the Roman Catholic Church. Will she defend herself  against the charge of being in conflict with science? Is she in the way of  human progress? How does she compare with Protestants in morality and  virtue?    Let us give you a few figures, by the way of negative evidence, upon the  question of comparative morality, remembering that it is a sad necessity  of our nature to have to determine which of us has the least of moral  miseries in order that we may know which has the most of virtue. Let this  be as it may, these moral miseries show themselves under two principal  phases, acts of profligacy and acts of violence; corrupt manners and  assassinations. Here is what we read in Jonnes:    Assassinations And Attempts To Assassinate In Europe.    Protestant--Scotland, 1835,        1 for 270,000  Protestant--England,               1 for 178,000  Protestant--Low Countries, 1824,   1 for 163,000  Protestant--Prussia, 1824,         1 for 100,000  Catholic States--Austria, 1809,    1 for 57,000  Catholic--Spain, 1826,             1 for 4,113  Catholic--Naples,                  1 for 2,750  Catholic--Roman States,            1 for 750    _Jonnes, vol. 2, p. 257._    Now, if we take the average, we have one assassination, or one attempt to  assassinate, for 180,222 inhabitants in the aggregate of the four  Protestant nations; and one assassination, or one attempt to assassinate,  for 16,153 inhabitants in the four Catholic nations; in other words,  eleven times more of these crimes among the Roman Catholic nations. The  contrast between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries in Spain is so  very striking, and is painted by a writer in such lively colors that one  is tempted to believe that the picture was intended to serve as a  demonstration.    \"Spain is a dispossessed queen. For two hundred years and more diamonds  have been falling from her glittering crown. The source of her wealth,  well or ill-gotten, is exhausted forever. Her treasures are lost, her  colonies are gone; she is deprived of the prestige of that external  opulence which veiled, or, at least dissembled her real and utter poverty.  The nation is exhausted to such a degree, and has been so long unhappy,  that each individual feels but his own misery. His country has ceased to  exist for him. Even those time are gone when the guerillas called the  citizens to arms for the sole and generous purpose of vindicating the  national honor. The despondency and apathy of the nation are visible even  in the battles fought by the Spaniards among themselves in their civil  dissensions. They fight from habit, and discharge their muskets at their  countrymen because they can do nothing else, and because every shot from  their guns may bring them a piece of bread. A nation reduced to such a  state is low indeed; the chilliness of death is very near seizing upon its  extremities. What a length of time it will require to heal the wounds of  these populations, so brave and so devoted!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#5)"],[1,"looped curve thus described is depicted for Jupiter and Saturn in  the annexed diagram (fig. 10.)         It was long ago perceived that real material spheres were       unnecessary; such spheres indeed, though possibly transparent to       light, would be impermeable to comets: any other epicyclic gearing       would serve, and as a mere description of the motion it is simpler       to think of a system of jointed bars, one long arm carrying a       shorter arm, the two revolving at different rates, and the end of       the short one carrying the planet. This does all that is needful       for the first approximation to a planet's motion. In so far as the       motion cannot be thus truly stated, the short arm may be supposed       to carry another, and that another, and so on, so that the       resultant motion of the planet is compounded of a large number of       circular motions of different periods; by this device any required       amount of complexity could be attained. We shall return to this at       greater length in Lecture III.         The main features of the motion, as shown in the diagram, required       only two arms for their expression; one arm revolving with the       average motion of the planet, and the other revolving with the       apparent motion of the sun, and always pointing in the same       direction as the single arm supposed to carry the sun. This last       fact is of course because the motion to be represented does not       really belong to the planet at all, but to the earth, and so all       the main epicyclic motions for the superior planets were the same.       As for the inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) they only appear       to oscillate like the bob of a pendulum about the sun, and so it is       very obvious that they must be really revolving round it. An       ancient Egyptian system perceived this truth; but the Ptolemaic       system imagined them to revolve round the earth like the rest, with       an artificial system of epicycles to prevent their ever getting far       away from the neighbourhood of the sun.         It is easy now to see how the Copernican system explains the main       features of planetary motion, the stations and retrogressions,       quite naturally and without any complexity.         [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Egyptian system.]         Let the outer circle represent the orbit of Jupiter, and the inner       circle the orbit of the earth, which is moving faster than Jupiter       (since Jupiter takes 4332 days to make one revolution); then       remember that the apparent position of Jupiter is referred to the       infinitely distant fixed stars and refer to fig. 12.         Let E_1, E_2, &c., be successive positions of the earth; J_1,       J_2, &c., corresponding positions of Jupiter. Produce the lines       E_1 J_1, E_2 J_2, &c., to an enormously greater circle       outside, and it will be seen that the termination of these lines,       representing apparent positions of Jupiter among the stars,       advances while the earth goes from E_1 to E_3; is almost       stationary from somewhere about E_3 to E_4; and recedes from       E_4 to E_5; so that evidently the recessions of Jupiter are       only apparent, and are due to the orbital motion of the earth. The       apparent complications in the path of Jupiter, shown in Fig. 10,       are seen to be caused simply by the motion of the earth, and to be       thus completely and easily explained.         [Illustration: FIG. 12.--True orbits of Earth and Jupiter.]         The same thing for an inferior planet, say Mercury, is even still       more easily seen (_vide_ figure 13).         The motion of Mercury is direct from M'' to M''', retrograde from       M''' to M'', and stationary at M'' and M'''. It appears to       oscillate, taking 72.5 days for its direct swing, and 43.5 for its       return swing.         [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Orbit of Mercury and Earth.]         On this system no artificiality is required to prevent Mercury's       ever getting far from the sun: the radius of its orbit limits its       real and apparent excursions. Even if the earth were stationary,       the motions of Mercury and Venus would not be _essentially_       modified, but the stations and retrogressions of the superior       planets, Mars, Jupiter, &c., would wholly cease.         The complexity of the old mode of regarding apparent motion may be       illustrated by the case of a traveller in a railway train unaware       of his own motion. It is as though trees, hedges, distant objects,       were all flying past him and contorting themselves as you may see       the furrows of a ploughed field do when travelling, while you       yourself seem stationary amidst it all. How great a simplicity       would be introduced by the hypothesis that, after all, these things       might be stationary and one's self moving.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Copernican system as frequently represented.  But the cometary orbit is a much later addition, and no attempt is made  to show the relative distances of the planets.]    Now you are not to suppose that the system of Copernicus swept away the  entire doctrine of epicycles; that doctrine can hardly be said to be  swept away even now. As a description of a planet's motion it is not  incorrect, though it is geometrically cumbrous. If you describe the  motion of a railway train by stating that every point on the rim of each  wheel describes a cycloid with reference to the earth, and a circle with  reference to the train, and that the motion of the train is compounded  of these cycloidal and circular motions, you will not be saying what is  false, only what is cumbrous.    The Ptolemaic system demanded large epicycles, depending on the motion  of the earth, these are what Copernicus overthrew; but to express the  minuter details of the motion smaller epicycles remained, and grew more  and more complex as observations increased in accuracy, until a greater  man than either Copernicus or Ptolemy, viz. Kepler, replaced them all by  a simple ellipse.    One point I must not omit from this brief notice of the work of  Copernicus. Hipparchus had, by most sagacious interpretation of certain  observations of his, discovered a remarkable phenomenon called the  precession of the equinoxes. It was a discovery of the first magnitude,  and such as would raise to great fame the man who should have made it in  any period of the world's history, even the present. It is scarcely  expressible in popular language, and without some technical terms; but I  can try.    The plane of the earth's orbit produced into the sky gives the apparent  path of the sun throughout a year. This path is known as the ecliptic,  because eclipses only happen when the moon is in it. The sun keeps to it  accurately, but the planets wander somewhat above and below it (fig. 9),  and the moon wanders a good deal. It is manifest, however, in order that  there may be an eclipse of any kind, that a straight line must be able  to be drawn through earth and moon and sun (not necessarily through  their centres of course), and this is impossible unless some parts of  the three bodies are in one plane, viz. the ecliptic, or something very  near it. The ecliptic is a great circle of the sphere, and is usually  drawn on both celestial and terrestrial globes.    The earth's equator also produced into the sky, where it may still be  called the equator (sometimes it is awkwardly called \"the equinoctial\"),  gives another great circle inclined to the ecliptic and cutting it at  two opposite points, labelled respectively [Aries symbol] and [Libra  symbol], and together called \"the equinoxes.\" The reason for the name is  that when the sun is in that part of the ecliptic it is temporarily also  on the equator, and hence is symmetrically situated with respect to the  earth's axis of rotation, and consequently day and night are equal all  over the earth.    Well, Hipparchus found, by plotting the position of the sun for a long  time,[2] that these points of intersection, or equinoxes, were not  stationary from century to century, but slowly moved among the stars,  moving as it were to meet the sun, so that he gets back to one of these  points again 20 minutes 23-1/4 seconds before it has really completed a  revolution, _i.e._ before the true year is fairly over. This slow  movement forward of the goal-post is called precession--the precession  of the equinoxes. (One result of it is to shorten our years by about 20  minutes each; for the shortened period has to be called a year, because  it is on the position of the sun with respect to the earth's axis that  our seasons depend.) Copernicus perceived that, assuming the motion of  the earth, a clearer account of this motion could be given. The ordinary  approximate statement concerning the earth's axis is that it remains  parallel to itself, _i.e._ has a fixed direction as the earth moves  round the sun. But if, instead of being thus fixed, it be supposed to  have a slow movement of revolution, so that it traces out a cone in the  course of about 26,000 years, then, since the equator of course goes  with it, the motion of its intersection with the fixed ecliptic is so  far accounted for. That is to say, the precession of the equinoxes is  seen to be dependent on, and caused by, a slow conical movement of the  earth's axis.    The prolongation of each end of the earth's axis into the sky, or the  celestial north and south poles, will thus slowly trace out an  approximate circle among the stars; and the course of the north pole  during historic time is exhibited in the annexed diagram.    It is now situated near one of the stars of the Lesser Bear, which we  therefore call the Pole star; but not always was it so, nor will it be  so in the future. The position of the north pole 4000 years ago is shown  in the figure; and a revolution will be completed in something like  26,000"]]]
