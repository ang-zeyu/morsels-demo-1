I informed her of my intentions. We pledged mutual and  lasting fidelity to each other, and I bid her farewell and went  to St. Louis to seek employment.    When I landed on the wharf at St. Louis I met a negro by the name  of Barton, who had formerly been a slave to my mother. He  informed me that he was a fireman on the steamboat Warrior,  running the upper Mississippi, between St. Louis, Missouri, and  Galena, Illinois. I told him I wanted work. He said he could get  me a berth on the Warrior as fireman, at twenty-five dollars a  month; but he considered the work more than I could endure, as it  was a hard, hot boat to fire on. I insisted on making the effort,  and was employed as fireman on the Warrior at twenty-five dollars  per month. I found the work very hard. The first two or three  times that I was on watch I feared I would be forced to give it  up; but my spirit bore me up, and I managed to do my work until  we reached the lower rapids near Keokuk. At this place the  Warrior transferred its freight, in light boats, over the rapids  to the Henry Clay, a steamer belonging to the same line.    The Henry Clay then lay at Commerce, now known as Nauvoo. I was  detailed with two others to take a skiff with four passengers  over the rapids. The passengers were Mrs. Bogges and her mother,  and a lady whose name I have forgotten, and Mr. Bogges. The  distance to the Henry Clay from where the Warrior lay was twelve  miles. A large portion of the cargo of the Warrior belonged to  the firm of Bogges & Co. When we had gone nearly halfway over the  rapids my two assistants got drunk and could no longer assist me;  they lay down in the skiff and went to sleep. Night was fast  approaching, and there was no chance for sleep or refreshment,  until we could reach Commerce or the Henry Clay. The whole labor  fell on me, to take that skiff and its load of passengers to the  steamer. Much of the distance I had to wade in the water and push  the skiff, as was most convenient. I had on a pair of new  calfskin boots when we started, but they were cut off my feet by  the rocks in the river long before we reached the end of the  journey.    After a deal of hardship I succeeded in getting my passengers to  the steamer just as it became dark. I was wet, cold, hungry, and  nearly exhausted. I sat down by the engine in my wet clothing and  soon fell asleep, without bedding or food. I slept from  exhaustion until near midnight, when I was seized with fearful  crampings, accompanied by a cold and deathlike numbness. I tried  to rise up, but could not. I thought my time had come, and that I  would perish without aid or assistance.    When all hope had left me I heard a footstep approaching, and a  man came and bent over me and asked if I was ill. I recognized  the voice as that of Mr. Bogges. I said I was in the agonies of  death, and a stranger without a friend on the boat. He felt my  pulse, and hastened away, saying as he left me:    \"Do not despair, young man, you are not without friends. I will  return at once.\"    He soon returned, bringing a lantern and a bottle of cholera  medicine, and gave me a large dose of the medicine; then he  brought the captain and others to me. I was soon comfortably  placed in bed, and from that time I had every attention paid me,  and all the medical care that was necessary. Mr. Bogges told me  that he had supposed I was one of the regular crew of the Henry  Clay, and was among friends; that his wife had noticed that I  appeared to be a stranger, and had seen me when I sat down by the  engine alone; that after they retired his wife was restless and  insisted on his getting up and finding me; this was the occasion  of his assistance coming as it did.    Mr. Bogges had contracted for freighting his goods to Galena,  where he resided; and had provided for the passage of himself,  wife, and mother-in-law. They would go by land from Commerce, as  he dreaded the passage of the upper rapids in time of low water,  as it then was.    After finishing the loading of the steamer I began to fire up to  get ready for a start. While so engaged, Mr. Bogges came to me,  and offered to employ me. He asked me then what wages I was  getting. I told him twenty-five dollars.    \"I will give you fifty dollars,\" said he.    We reached Galena in safety, and health. Now a new life  commenced. Mr. Bogges introduced me to John D. Mulligan, his  partner. I at once commenced my duties as bar-tender at the  store. The business was such that I found it more than play. Many  a time I did not get rest or sleep for forty-eight hours at a  time. I have frequently taken in one hundred dollars in twenty-  four hours for drinks, at five cents a drink. I paid attention to  business, making the interest of my employers my interest. On  account of my faithful services I was permitted to prepare hot  lunches during the night, to sell to gamblers. What I made was my  own. In this way I made from fifty to one hundred dollars a month  extra.    One day while I was absent from the store a French half-breed, by  the name of Shaunce got on a drunken spree and cleared out the  store and saloon. Hearing the disturbance I ran to the store. I  entered by the back door and went behind the counter. As I did so  Shaunce ran to the counter and grabbed a large number of  tumblers, and threw them about the house, breaking them all.    \"Shaunce, you must either behave, or go out of the house,\" I  said.    He jumped over the counter, caught me by the throat, and shoved  me back against the counter, saying:    \"You little dog, how dare you insult me!\"    There was no time to swap knives. I must either receive a beating  or do something to prevent it. I remembered the advice that my  uncle Conner had given me about fighting.    \"John, if you ever get in a fight with a man that overmatches  you, take one of his hands in both of yours, and let him strike  as he may, but get one of his fingers in your mouth and then bite  it, and hold on until he gives up,\" he had said.    Acting on this advice, I succeeded in getting one of Shaunce's  thumbs in my mouth. I held to it until I dislocated the thumb  joint, when he yelled:    \"Take him off!\"    This little affair made a quiet man of Shaunce, and my employers  were more pleased with me than ever before. They made me a  present of fifty dollars for what I had done.    While with Bogges & Co. I made money, and was saving of what I  earned. I did not gamble. I took good care of myself, and, having  the respect of every person, I admit I was quite vain and proud.  I was accused by the gamblers of being stingy with my money. So I  thought I would do as others did, and commenced to give money to  others as a stake to gamble with on shares. Soon I began to play.  I won and lost, but did not play to any great extent. Mr. Bogges  took me to task for gambling. He also showed me many of the  tricks of the gamblers, and I promised him to quit the practice  as soon as I got married.    In the early part of 1832 I received an affectionate letter from  my Emily, desiring me to return to her, and settle down before I  had acquired a desire for a rambling life. I then had five  hundred dollars in money and two suits of broadcloth clothing. I  was anxious to see Emily, so I settled up with Bogges & Co. and  started for home. Emily was then living at her sister's house in  Prairie de Roache; her brother-in-law, Thomas Blay, kept the  tavern there. I boarded with them about two weeks, during which  time I played cards with the Frenchman, and dealt \"vantune,\" or  twenty-one, for them to bet at. I was lucky, but I lived fast,  and spent my money freely, and soon found that half of it was  gone.    Emily was dissatisfied with my conduct. I proposed immediate  marriage; Emily proposed to wait until the next fall, during  which time we were to prepare for housekeeping. She wished to see  if I would reform, for she had serious doubts about the propriety  of marrying a gambler. She asked me to quit gambling, and if I  had made that promise all would have been well, but I was  stubborn and proud and refused to make any promise. I thought it  was beneath my dignity. I really intended to never gamble after  my wedding, but I would not tell her so; my vanity overruled my  judgment. I said that if she had not confidence enough in me to  take me as I was, without requiring me to give such a promise, I  would never see her again until I came to ask her to my wedding.    This was cruel, and deeply wounded Emily; she burst into tears  and turned from me. I never saw her again until I went to ask her  to attend my wedding. I went up into the country and stopped with  my cousins. While there I met the bride of my youth; she was the  daughter of Joseph Woolsey and Abigail, his wife. I attended  church, went to parties and picnics, and fell in love with Agathe  Ann, the eldest girl. The old folks were op- posed to my marrying  their daughter, but after suffering the tortures and overcoming  the obstacles usual in such cases, I obtained the consent of the  girl's parents, and was married to Agathe Ann Woolsey on the 24th  day of July, A. D. 1833.    The expenses of the wedding ended all my money, and I was ready  to start the world new and fresh. I had about fifty dollars to  procure things to keep house on, but it was soon gone; yet it  procured, about all we then thought we needed. I commenced  housekeeping near my wife's father's, and had good success in all  that I undertook. I made money, or rather I obtained considerable  property, and was soon comfortably fixed.        CHAPTER III - LEE BECOMES A MORMON    After I moved to Luck Creek I was a fortunate man and accumulated  property very fast. I look back to those days with pleasure. I  had a large house and I gave permission to all sorts of people to  come there and preach. Methodists, Baptists, Campbellites, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23533"],[0,"A War-time Journal, Germany 1914 and German Travel Notes (#5)"],[1,"parr Kalonnen deutscher Soldaten ein Stuck weges  zurueckgezogen haben\" (two columns of German soldiers had withdrawn a  bit of the way back). Then the writer contrasts the boastful words  (\"prahlender woerte\") of England with the self-restraint and pious calm  and virtuous behaviour of Germany. One has only to look at the  postcards in the Park Strasse to see which of the combatants is  boastful. England is drawn as ignominiously lying on the ground (when  she isn't running away) and Germany invariably is kicking or thrashing  her.    People are less friendly than at first, though the bath attendants,  people in the Inhalatorium, and doctors are most kind. I had tea at  Mueller's with Miss H---- the other day. There were at least thirty  empty chairs in the tea-room, but a German woman marched up to the  chair on which I had laid my daily newspaper, and ordered me to take  it off, as she must have my chair! She was stout and ugly, and had a  way of doing her hair which, as a writer says, \"alone would have  proved impeccable virtue in the face of incriminating circumstantial  evidence.\" For all their \"Kultur\" Germans are gross, and to the last  degree inartistic. Their \"_nouveau art_\" is repulsive; their dressing  outrageously ugly, and their cooking atrocious. I have watched them  here year after year tramping up and down the shady walks stolidly  drinking, wearing garments of ingeniously devised ugliness and blind  to \"_l'inutile beaute_.\" There is no variety of type nor individuality  of person in either men or women. These worthy _Hausfrauen_ have no  grace of dainty frills, diaphanous lace or rustling petticoats. They  are obviously and incontestably of the class described by a witty  writer to whom \"a lace petticoat is as much a badge of infamy as a  cigarette on the stage.\" The German proletariat cannot be susceptible  to externals, else the universal sad-coloured skirt, the ill-fitting  blouse and the ugly hat worn by his women-folk could not find favour  in his eyes.    Life in Altheim has changed under war conditions. The Kur Haus is  closed, there are no teas on the Terrace or promenadings to the  strains of Grieg or Strauss, or theatrical performances. The German  Kur-Gaeste have left, and only the Russian, English and a few Belgian  prisoners of war remain. Russians here are chiefly of a very low  class. Most of the women go about bareheaded, and all are rough and  unkempt and dirty-looking. I fancy some of them have suffered much  privation, but happily their order of release has come. They will have  to travel by Denmark, Sweden and across to Petrograd. The weather is  autumnal, and they have only summer clothes, like us. We cannot help  them, having so little money ourselves. I have had to borrow twice,  and tried to sell my jewellery without success, but I have developed a  latent and unsuspected talent for laundry work. The pretty summer  shops in the Park Strasse are now closed, and the sound of beating  mattresses is heard everywhere; the blinds of most of the villas are  drawn down, and the families having no longer lodgers have descended  to their winter quarters on the ground floor. Only a few _einspaenners_  are left, as both _Kutschers_ and horses are gone to meet a  \"Heldentod\" for their Fatherland.    One sees white-capped nurses and Red Cross Ambulance men and wounded  and bandaged warriors everywhere. When recovered, the soldiers get  three days leave to visit their families, and then return to the  Front. Poor souls! Shops are chiefly tended by women nowadays, and  the German Frau is not a capable shopkeeper like the French woman. A  \"Drogerie\" here is presided over by the wife of the man who owns it,  in his absence at the war. She is a gentle, rather pretty creature,  but amazingly slow and stupid. If tooth-powder be asked for, she  mounts a ladder, searches among a hundred bottles, shakes her head  despairingly, and wonders where her \"Mann\" has put it. Outside her  Kueche and house, the German woman does not shine, but she is a  faithful unselfish wife, and a good and affectionate mother. Mr. Ives  thinks we shall certainly get away next week. I hope so! The weather  is cold and rainy, and there is no fire-place in my room.    _September 13th._--The Altheim daily papers complain that they are  inundated with foolish questions over the telephone. \"Ist Namur  belgisch oder franzoesisch?\" (Is Namur Belgian or French?)    \"Gehen die Schottlaender wirklich mit nackten Beinen in die Schlacht?\"  (Do the Highlanders really go into battle with naked legs?)    \"Wie lange wird es ungefaehr dauern, bis die Deutschen Paris  eingenommen haben?\" (How long will it be before the Germans have  taken Paris?) and so on.    _September 14th._--Again rumours of our going, but even though release  will be most welcome, we all dread the journey. Terrible tales come to  us of the treatment meted out to foreigners crossing the frontier.  Many English were turned out of Wiesbaden and sent here. At F---- they  had their luggage searched, and the ladies of the party were stripped  to the skin by women who even combed their hair to see if by any  ingenuity they had concealed plans and drawings in the puffs and  coils, two soldiers with fixed bayonets mounting guard meanwhile  outside. No doubt we shall remember this journey to the end of our  lives, but what can you expect from a people whose Prophet Nietzsche  says, \"What is more harmful than any vice? Pity for the weak and  helpless--Christianity!\"    _September 15th._--The singular absence of humour of the Germans often  amuses me. I think it was Palmerston who described Germany as \"that  land of damned Professors.\" They are all so desperately in earnest,  and their \"Kultur\" is so serious, that jokes and fun seem like  blasphemy. My penury has again been relieved by Mr. S----'s kind loan  of L1. Lady M---- came in to tell me that the American Vice-Consul had  telegraphed to Mr. W---- the good news that we are all to go on  Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday next. I have heard this story so often  that I am utterly sceptical. We conclude that things are going badly  for the enemy, since there is no bell-ringing, and the flags have been  taken in.    [Illustration: NUR IN LONDON NICHT  (_But not in London!_)]    _September 16th._--I hear that no men who have served in the Army or  Navy are to be allowed to go with us. To-day's \"Frankfurter Zeitung\"  thinks that England must be at her last gasp, or she would not have  \"barbarians such as Indians, Japanese and _Highlanders_\" fighting her  battles for her! They also declare on \"unimpeachable evidence\" that  India is in a state of revolt, and that the Japanese are to be  despatched at once to quell the rebellion. Any misfortune to the  British delights them.    _September 17th._--The B----s, who to our envy have received special  passes to go to Denmark, got as far as Hamburg and then had their  passports taken from them. The Chaplain and his wife disappeared one  morning, and we learn that he obtained a special pass on the ground of  being a clergyman. He was heard to utter something about the \"Bishop  of London,\" and perhaps that was the talisman. Lady M---- tells me  that they have arrived in Hamburg, we wonder what their fate will be!    A delightful story has just reached me from an Italian source. In the  church of a Convent Hospital in France, one of the sisters was  praying aloud with immense fervour, and when she came to the  \"Confiteor\" she said: \"C'est ma faute! c'est ma faute! c'est ma tres  grande faute,\" whereupon uprose a Turco crying out: \"Ah! non! ma  Soeur! c'est la faute a Guilleaume!\"    _September 18th._--A letter at last! but only one from the American  Consul at Frankfort, saying that the Foreign Office wanted to know my  whereabouts as several friends had inquired about me and my safety. I  can't imagine why, when America rescued her stranded citizens long  ago, and sent them money to get home, we should be suffering like  this. Nothing more about the phantom train! Our nerves are becoming  wrought up, and we are developing unexpectedly irritable and  argumentative natures. The weather is amazingly windy and horribly  cold, one shivers in summer garments, and cannot afford to buy warmer  things. A leading article in the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" gives us a  grain of comfort, since it is headed \"Geduld und Zuversicht\" (patience  and confidence), and begins,    \"In consequence of the victorious news of the first weeks, those  remaining at home had become accustomed to constant victories, and  the pause in the news of the battlefield of the West is a great trial  of patience.\" Long may that trial last! On the whole we ought to be  thankful that we are in Hesse and not in Prussia. The Hessians are a  simple, kindly people, pleasant, and good tempered. I have known  Germany well for eighteen years. When first we travelled in the  Fatherland I found each Duchy, or Kingdom, or Principality, devoted to  its own particular Ruler, and little outside it mattered to its  people. Nowadays there are no Hessians or Wuertembergers, not even  Saxons or Bavarians, but all are Germans, and for one photograph of  the Grand Duke of Hesse and his Duchess you will see here one hundred  of \"Unser Kaiser\" and \"Unsere Kaiserin.\" They have become  Imperialists, and the ambitious spirit which animates them is shown by  the act of a soldier at Liege who chalked up on a wall: \"Kaiser  Wilhelm the Second, Emperor of Europe.\"    I have now 2_d._ left in the world, and have not taken my inhalation  for two days, not being able to pay for it. The money I telegraphed  for has not yet come, and life seems very difficult! I think of the  old lines:        \"'Tis a very good world we live in,      To lend, or to spend, or to give in;      But to beg, or to borrow, or get a man's own,      'Tis the very worst world that ever was known.\"    _September 19th._--At the eleventh hour and when I seemed at the end  of my resources, help"]]]
