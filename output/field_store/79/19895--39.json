[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#5)"],[1,"who made a collection of books, and taught the kings of Egypt how to  arrange a library[10]\"--words which may be taken to mean that Aristotle  was the first to work out the arrangement of books on a definite system  which was afterwards adopted by the Ptolemies at Alexandria.    These notices are extremely disappointing. They merely serve to shew that  collections of books did exist in Greece; but they give us no indication  of either their extent or their arrangement. It was left to the Emperor  Hadrian to build the first public library at Athens, to which, as it was  naturally constructed on a Roman design, I shall return after I have  described those from which it was in all probability imitated.    But, if what may be termed Greece in Europe declines to give us  information, that other Greece which extended itself to Asia Minor and to  Egypt--Greater Greece it would be called in modern times--supplies us with  a type of library-organisation which has been of far-reaching influence.    After the death of Alexander the Great (B.C. 323) a Greek dynasty, that of  the Ptolemies, established itself at Alexandria, and another Greek dynasty  at Pergamon. Both were distinguished--like Italian despots of the  Renaissance--for the splendour and the culture of their courts, and they  rivalled one another in the extent and richness of their libraries; but,  if we are to believe Strabo, the library at Pergamon was not begun until  the reign of Eumenes II. (B.C. 197-159), or 126 years after that at  Alexandria[11].    The libraries at Alexandria (for there were two)--though far more  celebrated and more extensive than the library at Pergamon--need not, from  my point of view, detain us for more than a moment, for we are told very  little about their position, and nothing about their arrangement. The site  of the earliest, the foundation of which is ascribed to Ptolemy the Second  (B.C. 285-247), must undoubtedly be sought for within the circuit of the  royal palace, which was in the fashionable quarter of the city called  Brucheion. This palace was a vast enceinte, not a separate building, and,  as Strabo, who visited Alexandria 24 B.C., says,        Within the precincts of the palace is the Museum. It has      a colonnade, a lecture-room, and a vast establishment      where the men of letters who share the use of the Museum      take their meals together. This College has a common      revenue; and is managed by a priest who is over the      Museum, an officer formerly appointed by the kings of      Egypt, but, at the present time, by the Emperor[12].    That the older of the two libraries must have been in some way connected  with these buildings seems to me certain from two considerations. First, a  ruler who took so keen an interest in books as Ptolemy, would assuredly  have kept his treasures under his own eye; and, secondly, he would hardly  have placed them at a distance from the spot where the learned men of  Alexandria held their meetings[13].    At some period subsequent to the foundation of Ptolemy's first library, a  second, called the daughter of the first[14], was established in connexion  with the Temple of Serapis, a magnificent structure in the quarter  Rhacotis, adorned so lavishly with colonnades, statuary, and other  architectural enrichments, that the historian Ammianus Marcellinus  declares that nothing in the world could equal it, except the Roman  Capitol[15].    This brief notice of the libraries of Alexandria shews that the earlier of  the two, besides being in a building dedicated to the Muses, was also  connected in all probability with a palace, and the second with a temple.  If we now turn to Pergamon, we shall find the library associated with the  temple and [Greek: temenos] of Athena.    The founder selected for the site of his city a lofty and precipitous  hill, about a thousand feet above the sea-level. The rocky plateau which  forms the summit is divided into three gigantic steps or terraces. On the  highest, which occupies the northern end of the hill, the royal palace is  believed to have been built. On the next terrace, to the south, was the  temple of Athena; and on the third, the altar of Zeus. External to those  three groups of buildings, partly on the edge of the hill, partly on its  sides, were the rest of the public buildings. The lower slopes were  probably occupied in ancient times, as at present, by the houses of the  citizens.    These magnificent structures, which won for Pergamon the distinction of  being \"by far the noblest city in Asia minor[16],\" were in the main due to  Eumenes the Second, who, during his reign of nearly forty years (B.C.  197-159), was enabled, by the wise policy of supporting the Romans, to  transform his petty state into a powerful monarchy. The construction of a  library is especially referred to him by Strabo[17], and from the  statement of Vitruvius that it was built for the delight of the world at  large (_in communem delectationem_), we may infer that it was intended to  be public[18]. That he was an energetic book-collector, under whose  direction a large staff of scribes was perpetually at work, may be  gathered from the well-known story that his bibliographical rival at  Alexandria, exasperated by his activity and success, conceived the  ingenious device of crippling his endeavours by forbidding the exportation  of papyrus. Eumenes, however, says the chronicler, was equal to the  occasion, and defeated the scheme by inventing parchment[19]. It is  probable that Eumenes not only began but completed the library, for in  less than a quarter of a century after his death (B.C. 133) the last of  his descendants bequeathed the city and state of Pergamon to the Romans.  It is improbable that they would do much to increase the library, though  they evidently took care of it, for ninety years later, when Mark Antony  is said to have given it to Cleopatra, the number of works in it amounted  to two hundred thousand[20].    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Plan of the temple and precinct of Athena,  Pergamon; with that of the Library and adjacent buildings.]    The site of the acropolis of Pergamon was thoroughly explored between 1878  and 1886 at the expense of the German Government; and in the course of  their researches the archeologists employed discovered certain rooms which  they believe to have been originally appropriated to the library. I have  had the accompanying ground-plan (fig. 2) reduced from one of their  plates, and have condensed my description of the locality from that given  in their work[21]. I have also derived much valuable information from a  paper published by Alexander Conze in 1884[22].    Of the temple of Athena only the foundations remain, but its extent and  position can be readily ascertained. The enclosure, paved with slabs of  marble, was entered at the south-east corner. It was open to the west and  to the south, where the ground falls away precipitously, but on the east  and north it was bounded by a cloister in two floors. The pillars of this  cloister were Doric on the ground-floor, Ionic above. The height of those  in the lower range, measured from base to top of capital, was about 16  feet, of those in the upper range about 9 feet.    This enclosure had a mean length of about 240 feet, with a mean breadth of  162 feet[23]. The north cloister was 37 feet broad, and was divided down  the centre by a row of columns. The east cloister was of about half this  width, and was undivided.    On the north side of the north cloister, the German explorers found four  rooms, which they believe to have been assigned to library purposes. The  platform of rock on which these chambers stood was nearly 20 feet above  the level of the floor of the enclosure, and they could only be entered  from the upper cloister. Of these rooms the easternmost is the largest,  being 42 feet long, by 49 feet broad. Westward of it are three others,  somewhat narrower, having a uniform width of 39 feet. The easternmost of  these three rooms is also the smallest, being only 23 feet long; while the  two next have a uniform length of about 33 feet.    At the south-west corner of this building, but on a lower level, and not  accessible from it, other rooms were found, the use of which is uncertain.    We will now return to the eastern room. The foundations of a narrow  platform or bench extended along the eastern, northern, and western sides,  and in the centre of the northern side there was a mass of stone-work  which had evidently formed the base for a statue (fig. 2, A). The  discovery of a torso of a statue of Athena[24] in this very room indicated  what statue had occupied this commanding position, and also what had  probably been the use of the room.    This theory was confirmed by the discovery in the north wall of two rows  of holes in the stone-work, one above the other, which had evidently been  made for the reception of brackets, or battens, or other supports for  shelves[25], or some piece of furniture. The lower of these two rows was  carried along the east wall as well as along the north wall. Further,  stones were found bearing the names of Herodotus, Alcaeus, Timotheus of  Miletus, and Homer, evidently the designations of portrait-busts or  portrait-medallions; and also, two titles of comedies.    Lastly, the very position of these rooms in connexion with the colonnade  indicates their use. It will be observed that the colonnade on the north  side of the area is twice as wide as that on the east side--a peculiarity  which is sufficient of itself to prove that it must have been intended for  some other purpose than as a mere covered way. But, if it be remembered  that libraries in the ancient world were usually connected with colonnades  (as was probably the case at the Serapeum at Alexandria, and was certainly  the case at Rome, as I shall proceed to shew) a reason is found for this  dignified construction, and a strong confirmation is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#5)"],[1,"from Wiggers in 1839. The former chemist  proposed the name buxine for all these analogous principles. Pelosine  or buxine is precipitated by a concentrated solution of HCl, by  sal ammoniac, by potassium nitrate and potassium iodide. He also  discovered a neutral substance, _deyamitin_, which crystallizes in  microscopic tablets; sulphuric acid added to these gives a pretty  dark blue color which changes to green.    Botanical Description.--A climbing shrub with cylindrical woody  stem, with leaves simple, alternate, entire, petiolate, ovoid,  broad at the base. The inferior surface of the leaf is pubescent,  especially in the intervals between the ribs. Flowers dioecious, small,  racemose. Calyx of 12 sepals arranged in 3 whorls, the inner ones  broad and petaloid. Corolla of 6 petals arranged in 2 whorls. Stamens  sterile or rudimentary in the pistillate flower, the staminate flower  bearing 6; anthers innate, 2-celled. Drupes oval, 2 or 3 cm. long,  black, closely resembling a grape seed.          NYMPHÆACEÆ.    Water-Lily Family.        _Nymphæa Lotus_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Lawas_, _Talaylo_, _Tunas_, _Gaway-gaway_, Tag., Vis.,  Pam.; _Water Lily_, Eng.    Uses.--The anaphrodisiac virtues attributed to this plant and to  all the water-lily family are purely imaginary. Its juice being  slightly bitter and astringent is used in decoction as an injection  in gonorrhoea. It possesses mild narcotic properties, for which some  use the juice of the whole plant, rubbing the forehead and temples  with it to produce sleep.    Botanical Description.--An aquatic plant, with leaves solitary,  terminal, floating on the water, dentate, glabrous, broad, deeply cleft  at the base, with a very long petiole. Flowers solitary, persistent in  the ripe fruit, oval. Stamens indefinite in fine whorls or verticils.    Habitat.--Common on the shores of the Laguna de Bay.        _Nelumbium nucifera_, Gaertn. (_N. speciosum_, Willd.; _N. Asiaticum_,  Rich.; _Cyamus Nelumbo_, Sm.; _C. mysticus_, Salis.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Bayno_, Tag.; _Sukaw_, Iloc.; _Sacred Lotus_, Eng.    Uses.--An infusion of the flowers is used internally in dysentery. In  India they use, for diarrhoea and vomiting, the viscid juice obtained  from the petioles and the peduncles of the flowers. The rootstock  contains a large quantity of starch which has been utilized for food  in the periods of famine which have desolated India and Egypt. This  flower was the Sacred Lotus of the Egyptians and the people of India  have dedicated it to Lakshmi, the goddess of health and prosperity.    Infusion.--Petals, dried        5 grams.             Water              250 grams.    Sig. To be taken during 24 hours.    Botanical Description.--An aquatic plant with fleshy rootstock which  creeps along the muddy bottoms; from its nodes spring the stalks of  the leaves and flowers. Its leaves are alternate, polymorphous, some  above and some below the surface of the water, concave in the center  whence ribs separate, shield-shaped. Petioles very long, bearing soft,  short spines. The flowers white or pink, solitary; peduncle long  and, like the petioles, covered with soft, short spines. Calyx of  4-5 unequal sepals, imbricated. Corolla with an indefinite number of  unequal petals, the inner ones shorter. Stamens indefinite, inserted in  the base of the receptacle. Receptacle expanded above the androecium,  in the form of an inverted cone, containing a large number of alveoli  with circular openings.          PAPAVERACEÆ.    Poppy Family.        _Argemone Mexicana_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Kasubhang-aso_, Iloc.    Uses.--Padre Blanco says that the yellow juice of this plant \"is  used by the natives (Filipinos) to treat fissures of the corners of  the eyes.\"    The negros of Senegal use the decoction of the root to cure  gonorrhoea. The milky juice to which Blanco refers is used in  different countries to treat various skin diseases, including the  cutaneous manifestations of syphilis and leprosy; to remove warts,  and as an eye wash in catarrhal conjunctivitis.    The English physicians of India state that it is dangerous to use  the milky juice as an application to the eye, although Dymock claims  the contrary.    The flowers are narcotic by virtue of a principle resembling morphine,  perhaps identical with that alkaloid.    The seeds yield a fixed oil on expression, which is laxative and  relieves the pains of colic, probably by virtue of its narcotic  properties. Physicians in India praise this oil highly; not only is  it a sure and painless purgative, but it is free from the viscidity  and disgusting taste of castor-oil; besides it has the advantage of  operating in small doses, 2-4 grams. Its activity is proportionate to  its freshness. Dr. W. O'Shaughnessy does not value this oil highly,  but the experience of many distinguished physicians of India has  proved the purgative and other properties that have just been  mentioned. Possibly the differences of opinion may arise from the  fact that oils from different plants were used in the trials.    The seeds yield a fixed oil, yellow, clear, of sweet taste, density  0.919 at 15°; it remains liquid at -5°; is soluble in an equal volume  of alcohol at 90°; characterized by an orange-red color on adding  nitric acid. From its soap Frolicher has obtained acetic, valerianic,  butyric and benzoic acids. Charbonnier claims to have found morphine  in its leaves and capsules. Dragendorf has isolated from the seeds  an alkaloid which presents the principal characters of morphine. It  is, then, probable that morphine is the narcotic principle possessed  by this plant, which is not hard to believe when one considers the  family to which it belongs.    Botanical Description.--A plant of American origin nowadays  acclimated in almost all warm countries. Its stem is green,  pubescent, 30-40 centimeters high. Leaves alternate, thin, sessile,  lanceolate, covered with rigid green thorns. Flowers hermaphrodite,  terminal, yellow. Calyx, 3 sepals with conical points. Corolla, 6  rounded petals. Stamens indefinite, free, hypogynous. Ovary free,  triangular. Capsule expanded, oblong, angular, thickly set with  prickles: it opens inferiorly by 5 valves.          CRUCIFERÆ.    Mustard Family.        _Brassica juncea_, Hook. & Thom. (_Sinapis juncea_, L.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Mostaza_, Sp.; _Mustard_, Eng.    Uses.--The seeds are used in the same way as those of white or black  mustard (_Sinapis alba_ and _S. nigra_, L.).    Botanical Description.--Plant with a glabrous stem, leaves sessile,  glabrous, lanceolate, the upper ones serrate, the lower ones almost  entire. Flowers in racemes. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 rounded,  unguiculate petals. Stamens 6, two of them short and the other four  longer and united in pairs. Ovary flattened. Seed vessel quadrangular,  nodular, glabrous, containing many oval seeds.        _Raphanus sativus, L._    Nom. Vulg.--_Rábano_, Sp.; _Radish_, Eng.    Uses.--Used principally as food; it possesses the antiscorbutic  properties common to the greater part of the Cruciferæ.    It is an herbaceous plant, the root of which is so commonly known  that its description would be useless.          CAPPARIDACEÆ.    Caper Family.        _Cleome viscosa_, L. (_C. icosandra_, L.; _Polanisia viscosa_, DC.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Balabalanoyan_, _Apoyapoyan_, Tag.; _Wild Mustard_, Eng.    Uses.--The seeds possess the same properties as those of mustard and  are used in place of the latter in Manila. In America the leaves are  used as a poultice in otitis, their action being rubefacient. In India  the seeds are given internally for their anthelmintic and carminative  effect; the dose is one teaspoonful twice a day. The juice of the  leaves mixed with cocoanut oil is used in the form of eardrops in  suppurative otitis.    The natives give the same common name to the _Gynandropsis  pentaphylla_, DC. (_Cleome pentaphylla_, L.; _C. altiacea_ or  _C. alliodora_, Blanco), which is distinguished from the former  by its six stamens inserted on the pistil and its violet-colored  stem. Its therapeutic properties are identical with those of  the _Cleome viscosa_. Dr. Sir W. Jones believes that the plant  possesses antispasmodic properties, basing his belief on its odor,  which resembles _asafetida_, though not so disagreeable. In India the  juice of the leaves is a popular remedy for earache. It is also used  there as a rubefacient.    Botanical Description.--An annual, the stem channeled and bearing  glandular hairs. Leaves compound, alternate; leaflets lanceolate with  glandular hairs. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, yellow. Stamens  14-16, encircling the pistil. Seed vessels cylindrical, with channels  and glandular hairs. The whole plant is sticky and emits a garlicky  odor.      _Cratæva religiosa_, Forst.    Nom. Vulg.--_Salingbobog_, Tag.; _Balay-namuk_, Iloc.    Uses.--It is in common use in India as a tonic and stomachic. It  seems also to possess laxative and diuretic properties. In Concan  the juice of the leaves mixed with cocoanut oil is used as a liniment  in rheumatism.    Infusion.--Leaves, fresh            50 grams.             Water                   500 grams.    Dose.--50-100 grams a day as a tonic or stomachic.    Botanical Description.--A shrub 15-20° high with compound trifoliate  leaves with long petioles; leaflets lanceolate, acuminate, smooth,  dark green. Calyx of 4 imbricated sepals. Corolla of 4 unguiculate  petals, between white and straw color, 1' long. Stamens indefinite,  violet-colored. Ovary unilocular, many-ovuled. Berry spherical with  many seeds buried in pulp.    Habitat.--Blanco has seen the plant growing in Ilocos and Imus.          BIXINEÆ.        _Bixa Orellana_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Atsuiti_, _Achuiti_, Tag.; _Achiote_, _Achuete_, Sp.-Fil.;  _Annatto_, Eng.    Uses.--The principal use of the seeds is in cookery and everybody  knows the yellow color which Filipino cooks impart to almost all  their dishes. In medicine"]]]
