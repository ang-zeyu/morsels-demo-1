She urged the nature of her vows,        Required her now the rites were done      To follow where her loving spouse        Might e'en a chance of danger run.        \"Go then, my child,--we give thee leave,        But with thy husband quick return,      Before the flickering shades of eve        Deepen to night, and planets burn,      And forest-paths become obscure,        Lit only by their doubtful rays.      The gods, who guard all women pure,        Bless thee and kept thee in thy ways,      And safely bring thee and thy lord!\"        On this she left, and swiftly ran      Where with his saw in lieu of sword,        And basket, plodded Satyavan.        Oh, lovely are the woods at dawn,        And lovely in the sultry noon,      But loveliest, when the sun withdrawn        The twilight and a crescent moon      Change all asperities of shape,        And tone all colours softly down,      With a blue veil of silvered crape!        Lo! By that hill which palm-trees crown,      Down the deep glade with perfume rife        From buds that to the dews expand,      The husband and the faithful wife        Pass to dense jungle,--hand in hand.        Satyavan bears beside his saw        A forked stick to pluck the fruit,      His wife, the basket lined with straw;        He talks, but she is almost mute,      And very pale. The minutes pass;        The basket has no further space,      Now on the fruits they flowers amass        That with their red flush all the place      While twilight lingers; then for wood        He saws the branches of the trees,      The noise, heard in the solitude,        Grates on its soft, low harmonies.        And all the while one dreadful thought        Haunted Savitri's anxious mind,      Which would have fain its stress forgot;        It came as chainless as the wind,      Oft and again: thus on the spot        Marked with his heart-blood oft comes back      The murdered man, to see the clot!        Death's final blow,--the fatal wrack      Of every hope, whence will it fall?        For fall, by Narad's words, it must;      Persistent rising to appall        This thought its horrid presence thrust.        Sudden the noise is hushed,--a pause!        Satyavan lets the weapon drop--      Too well Savitri knows the cause,        He feels not well, the work must stop.      A pain is in his head,--a pain        As if he felt the cobra's fangs,      He tries to look around,--in vain,        A mist before his vision hangs;      The trees whirl dizzily around        In a fantastic fashion wild;      His throat and chest seem iron-bound,        He staggers, like a sleepy child.        \"My head, my head!--Savitri, dear,        This pain is frightful. Let me lie      Here on the turf.\" Her voice was clear        And very calm was her reply,      As if her heart had banished fear:        \"Lean, love, thy head upon my breast,\"      And as she helped him, added--\"here,        So shall thou better breathe and rest.\"      \"Ah me, this pain,--'tis getting dark,        I see no more,--can this be death?      What means this, gods?--Savitri, mark,        My hands wax cold, and fails my breath.\"        \"It may be but a swoon.\" \"Ah! no--        Arrows are piercing through my heart,--      Farewell my love! for I must go,        This, this is death.\" He gave one start      And then lay quiet on her lap,        Insensible to sight and sound,      Breathing his last.... The branches flap        And fireflies glimmer all around;      His head upon her breast; his frame        Part on her lap, part on the ground,      Thus lies he. Hours pass. Still the same,        The pair look statues, magic-bound.      PART III.        Death in his palace holds his court,        His messengers move to and fro,      Each of his mission makes report,        And takes the royal orders,--Lo,      Some slow before his throne appear        And humbly in the Presence kneel:      \"Why hath the Prince not been brought here?        The hour is past; nor is appeal      Allowed against foregone decree;        There is the mandate with the seal!      How comes it ye return to me        Without him? Shame upon your zeal!\"        \"O King, whom all men fear,--he lies        Deep in the dark Medhya wood,      We fled from thence in wild surprise,        And left him in that solitude.      We dared not touch him, for there sits,        Beside him, lighting all the place,      A woman fair, whose brow permits        In its austerity of grace      And purity,--no creatures foul        As we seemed, by her loveliness,      Or soul of evil, ghost or ghoul,        To venture close, and far, far less        \"To stretch a hand, and bear the dead;        We left her leaning on her hand,      Thoughtful; no tear-drop had she shed,        But looked the goddess of the land,      With her meek air of mild command.\"--        \"Then on this errand I must go      Myself, and bear my dreaded brand,        This duty unto Fate I owe;      I know the merits of the prince,        But merit saves not from the doom      Common to man; his death long since        Was destined in his beauty's bloom.\"      PART IV.        As still Savitri sat beside        Her husband dying,--dying fast,      She saw a stranger slowly glide        Beneath the boughs that shrunk aghast.      Upon his head he wore a crown        That shimmered in the doubtful light;      His vestment scarlet reached low down,        His waist, a golden girdle dight.      His skin was dark as bronze; his face        Irradiate, and yet severe;      His eyes had much of love and grace,        But glowed so bright, they filled with fear.        A string was in the stranger's hand        Noosed at its end. Her terrors now      Savitri scarcely could command.        Upon the sod beneath a bough,      She gently laid her husband's head,        And in obeisance bent her brow.      \"No mortal form is thine,\"--she said,        \"Beseech thee say what god art thou?      And what can be thine errand here?\"        \"Savitri, for thy prayers, thy faith,      Thy frequent vows, thy fasts severe,        I answer,--list,--my name is Death.        \"And I am come myself to take        Thy husband from this earth away,      And he shall cross the doleful lake        In my own charge, and let me say      To few such honours I accord,        But his pure life and thine require      No less from me.\" The dreadful sword        Like lightning glanced one moment dire;      And then the inner man was tied,        The soul no bigger than the thumb,      To be borne onwards by his side:--        Savitri all the while stood dumb.        But when the god moved slowly on        To gain his own dominions dim,      Leaving the body there--anon        Savitri meekly followed him,      Hoping against all hope; he turned        And looked surprised. \"Go back, my child!\"      Pale, pale the stars above them burned,        More weird the scene had grown and wild;      \"It is not for the living--hear!        To follow where the dead must go,      Thy duty lies before thee clear,        What thou shouldst do, the Shasters show.        \"The funeral rites that they ordain        And sacrifices must take up      Thy first sad moments; not in vain        Is held to thee this bitter cup;      Its lessons thou shall learn in time!        All that thou _canst_ do, thou hast done      For thy dear lord. Thy love sublime        My deepest sympathy hath won.      Return, for thou hast come as far        As living creature may. Adieu!      Let duty be thy guiding star,        As ever. To thyself be true!\"        \"Where'er my husband dear is led,        Or journeys of his own free will,      I too must go, though darkness spread        Across my path, portending ill,      'Tis thus my duty I have read!        If I am wrong, oh! with me bear;      But do not bid me backward tread        My way forlorn,--for I can dare      All things but that; ah! pity me,        A woman frail, too sorely tried!      And let me, let me follow thee,        O gracious god,--whate'er betide.        \"By all things sacred, I entreat,        By Penitence that purifies,      By prompt Obedience, full, complete,        To spiritual masters, in the eyes      Of gods so precious, by the love        I bear my husband, by the faith      That looks from earth to heaven above,        And by thy own great name O Death,      And all thy kindness, bid me not        To leave thee, and to go my way,      But let me follow as I ought        Thy steps and his, as best I may.        \"I know that in this transient world        All is delusion,--nothing true;      I know its shows are mists unfurled        To please and vanish. To renew      Its bubble joys, be magic bound        In _Maya's_ network frail and fair,      Is not my aim! The gladsome sound        Of husband, brother, friend, is air      To such as know that all must die,        And that at last the time must come,      When eye shall speak no more to eye        And Love cry,--Lo, this is my sum.        \"I know in such a world as this        No one can gain his heart's desire,      Or pass the years in perfect bliss;        Like gold we must be tried by fire;      And each shall suffer as he acts        And thinks,--his own sad burden bear;      No friends can help,--his sins are facts        That nothing can annul or square,      And he must bear their consequence.        Can I my husband save by rites?      Ah, no,--that were a vain pretence,        Justice eternal strict requites.        \"He for his deeds shall get his due        As I for mine: thus here each soul      Is its own friend if it pursue        The right, and run straight for the goal;      But"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#5)"],[1,"th, like a glue pot, as excessive heat  will darken it. Cakes of wax of suitable colors may be had of the supply  dealers and are most economical when no great amount of work is done.  The same parties supply the paper pulp previously mentioned.          CHAPTER IV.    PANELS, SHIELDS AND NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL MOUNTS.      The preparation of a suitable setting for almost any mounted specimen  will add greatly to its attractiveness. If you know where it is to be  placed it is not difficult to make it suit its surrounding. For  instance, a head of big game for hanging in a dining or ball room is  suitably mounted on a polished and carved hardwood shield. While this  would hardly match its surroundings on the wall of a log camp, a rustic  panel of natural wood with the bark on would perfectly suit the latter  place.    Heads, horns, and antlers are usually mounted on what are called  shields. Fish and trophies of dead game birds and small game on panels.  Single specimens are placed on severely plain wooden bases (museum  style) or on those simulating branches, rocks, stumps or earth. These  are artificial, but those built up in part at least with natural objects  are most pleasing.    As we can not produce the best patterns of shields without special  machines we must patronize either the supply dealers or the wood working  mill for such. If convenient to a mill equipped with jigsaw and moulder  they can be made up after your own patterns.    [Illustration: SHIELDS--VARIOUS KINDS AND SIZES.    (A) Suitable for moose, caribou, deer, fox by making or ordering  according to size wanted; (B) Moose, caribou, deer; (K) Round shield;  (E) Bear shield; (Q) Combination--head and feet.]    [Illustration: SHIELDS, FOOT AND HALL RACK.

(M) Shield with carving (G) Panel for game, x, y, z, aa, bb Deer foot  thermometers (L) Deer foot thermometer and small animal panel.]    Some of the sizes most used are approximately as follows for mounted  heads:        For moose, elk, caribou.        20x30 inches.        For deer, goat or sheep.        12x18 or 16x21.        For fox or lynx.        8x10 inches.        For bear or wolf.        12x15        For birds, small fur-bearers and fish.        6x8 in.        Oval panels for mounting fish.        9x22         15x40        For dead game.        10x15    14x24    17x25    For mounting horns of elk and moose the size for deer heads will answer  nicely, while deer antlers are suitable with a shield of the fox head  size.    In order to draw a symmetrical pattern for the woodworker, take a piece  of stiff paper of the right length and width, fold it down the middle,  draw one half to suit and cut out with shears. The style of moulding  called Ogee is to be preferred. A simple diamond, heart, or oval shape  can be made at home with beveled or rounded edges, or if your tools  include a turning saw (which is most useful for a variety of purposes)  you may try a more pretentious shield. To achieve this, make your  pattern as just described and after marking it on a piece of wood from  3/8 to 7/8 inch thick, cut out with the turning saw. It should be held  in the vise for this operation. Place this cut out shield (1) on a piece  of board of similar thickness but somewhat larger and with a pair of  compasses mark out another 1/2 in. or so larger all around. (2) Also  mark the same distance inside the edge.    [Illustration: HOME MADE SHIELD.]    With a wood worker's gauge or something similar make a mark around them  both near the lower sides. Now with draw shave and rasp work the edges  off both Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1 on a bevel, No. 2 rounded. There should be  a number of holes drilled and countersunk in No. 2, from the back, and  when the two parts of the shield are properly adjusted they should be  drawn closely together with screws too short to penetrate the face of  the shield.    If the adjustment is perfect the screws are to be drawn and the surfaces  which come in contact coated well with glue, then drawn closely together  and laid aside until thoroughly dry, when it should be well sandpapered  before varnishing.    All shields and panels should be carefully sandpapered, filled and  varnished, and polished if you wish. Don't make the shield or panel so  ornate that the specimen will seem but an incidental, thrown in for good  measure, so to speak.    Rustic panels can be made by sawing the end from a log on a slant, and  planing smooth the oval. If this is heavily varnished on the front and  back and the bark left on it is a very suitable mount for small heads,  fish and birds. Artificial branches and trees for mounting birds should  be avoided if possible; they are made by wrapping tow around wires,  coating with glue and covering with moss or papier mache and painting.  The result I consider unnatural and inartistic.    [Illustration: SMALL BIRD.]    I would advise to use natural branches as far as possible; sufficient  labor will be required to make necessary joining and changes look as  near like nature as you can. Rock work is usually made of a wooden  framework covered with cloth, wire or paper and finished with a coating  of glue and crushed stone or sand. One of the most useful materials in  this work is the rough cork bark so much used by florists. It is light,  comes in desirable shapes, can be nailed, sawed or coated with glue or  paint. For constructing stumps for mounted birds of prey and rustic  stands for small and medium fur animals it has no equal. Some  taxidermists produce rock work of an obscure geological period by  covering screen wire forms with a mixture of flour, baking powder and  plaster of paris and water. This is put in an oven and baked hard, the  weird result being painted to the artist's taste.    Water worn roots such as are found along the shore, twisted laurel  branches, limbs of gum, oak and sassafras, all work up well in this and  should be stored up to dry against a day of need. Out door people have a  good eye for such things, but they are hard to find when you look for  them, so gather them on your rambles. Papier mache is also a good  modeling material for stumps, limbs and rock, being light, and readily  taking coats of glue or paint. The expert can copy nature closely with  it.    Some leaves and grasses can be pressed, dried and colored their natural  shades with oil paints. The dealers supply a great variety of artificial  foliage, some of which may be used to advantage, in case work  especially. Dried mosses and lichens of various sorts may be used in  this. Some of these powdered and glued on papier mache or cork bark  stumps and limbs produce a very pleasing effect.    Snow scenes are frequently attempted but are not always a success. The  peculiar fluffy and glittering appearance is rather difficult to  reproduce. Torn or ground up white blotting paper mixed with a little  ground mica has been used for this purpose. Glass icicles are listed by  dealers and are quite natural in appearance, but the simulation of water  is difficult and often disappointing.    It is often desirable to mount small specimens, of birds especially, in  cases of some kind which will protect them from dust, dirt and rough  handling and at the same time display them to advantage. The oldest and  at the same time the least suitable contrivance for this is the well  known bell glass or globe. It is difficult to find a safe place for this  in the average house and it is not at all adapted to many specimens.    A plain wall case with glass front and a painted or decorated background  will give the necessary protection with the least expense. For small  bird groups, and singles and pairs of game birds, the oval convex  glasses probably present the finest appearance. The backgrounds for  these may be either plush or wood panels or hand painted, and any style  of picture framing may be used. These are made in several sizes, listing  at $2.00 to $8.00 each without backgrounds or frames. This cost has  probably prevented their more common use.    There is on the market a papier mache background also adapted to any  picture frame, called the \"concave dust proof case.\" This has the flat  face glass of the old style wall case, but with the square corners and  much of the weight eliminated. Any of these styles of wall cases may be  placed on shelves as well as hung on the wall like pictures, at once  preventing breakage and becoming valuable decorations.    Special cases are often built (as in museums) for large and valuable  mounted specimens. Of these the top and at least three sides should be  of glass. The preparing and placing of the accessories in some large  museum cases have required an unbelievable amount of time and expense to  attain the desired natural appearance of the mounting.          CHAPTER V.    FIELD WORK, COLLECTING.      While it is unlikely that many readers of this book will undertake the  collection of natural history specimens in any great numbers or as a  special business, a few words on the subject may not be amiss.    It is well to bear in mind that the better the condition of the specimen  when it first comes to hand, the greater will be our chances of success  in properly preserving it. A small bird shot with a rifle is not worth  bothering with unless excessively rare, and a fur bearer which the dogs  have been allowed to maul and chew is very difficult to put in  satisfactory condition.    One rule of the collector in the field is to shoot each specimen with  the smallest possible charge of shot and powder which will kill it. I  speak of shooting, as probably three-fourths of the objects mounted by  the average taxidermist have been killed with fire arms.    Of late years a number of"]]]
