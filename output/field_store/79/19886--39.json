In most countries the passport is no longer a necessary document in  the traveller's pocketbook, though the Britisher still fondly arms  himself with this \"protection,\" and the American will, if it occurs  to him, be only too glad to contribute his dollars to the fees of his  consulate or embassy in order to possess himself of a gaudy thing in  parchment and gold which he can wave in front of any one whom he  thinks transgresses his rights as an American citizen: \"from the land  of liberty, and don't you forget it.\"    This is all very well and is no doubt the very essence of a proper  patriotism, but the best _piece d'identite_ for the foreigner who  takes up his residence in France for more than three months is a  simple document which can be obtained from the commissaire de police.  It will pass him anywhere in France that a passport will, is more  readily understood and accepted by the banker or post-office clerk as  a personal identification, and will save the automobile _chauffeur_  many an annoyance, if he has erred through lack of familiarity with  many little unwritten laws of the land.    The automobilist _en tour_ always has the identification papers of  his automobile; in England his \"License,\" and in France his  \"Certificat de Capacite\" and \"Recepisse de Declaration,\" which will  accomplish pretty much all the passport of other days would do if one  flourished it to-day before a stubborn octroi official or the  caretaker of a historical monument.    The membership card of the Italian, Swiss, or French touring clubs  will do much the same thing, and no one should be without them, since  membership in either one or all is not difficult or costly. (See  Appendix.)    France is the land _par excellence_ for the tourist, whether by road  or rail. The art of \"_le tourisme_\" has been perfected by the French  to even a higher degree than in Switzerland. There are numerous  societies, clubs, and associations, from the all-powerful Touring  Club de France downward, which are attracting not only the French  themselves to many hitherto little-known corners of \"_la belle  France_,\" but strangers from over the frontiers and beyond the seas.  These are not the tourists of the conventional kind, but those who  seek out the little-worn roads. It is possible to do this if one  travels intelligently by rail, but it is a great deal more  satisfactorily done if one goes by road.    Here and there, scattered all over France, in Dauphine, in Savoie,  and in the Pyrenees, one finds powerful \"Syndicats d'Initiative,\"  which not only care for the tourist, but bring pressure to bear on  the hotel-keeper and local authorities to provide something in the  way of improvements, where they are needed, to make a roadway safe,  or to restore a historical site or monument.    In the Pyrenees, and in the Alps of Savoie and Dauphine, one finds  everywhere the insignia of the \"Club-Alpin Francais,\" which caters  with information, etc., not only to the mountain-climber, but to the  automobilist and the general tourist as well.    More powerful and effective than all--more so even than the famous  Automobile Club de France--is the great Touring Club de France,  which, with the patronage of the President of the Republic, and the  influence of more than a hundred thousand members, is something more  than a mere touring club.    In the fourteen years of its existence not only has the Touring Club  de France helped the tourist find his way about, but also has taken a  leading part in the clearing away of the debris in many a moss-grown  ruin and making of it a historical monument as pleasing to view as  Jumieges on the Seine, or world-famed Les Baux in Provence.    It has appointed itself the special guardian of roads and roadways,  so far as the placing of signboards along the many important lines of  communication is concerned; it has been the means of having dug up  untold kilometres of Renaissance pavement; has made, almost at its  own expense, a magnificent forty-kilometre road known as the Corniche  de l'Esterel; and has given the backward innkeeper such a shock that  he has at last waked up to the needs of the twentieth-century  traveller. All this is something for a touring organization to have  accomplished, and when one can become a part and parcel of this great  organization, and a sharer in the special advantages which it has to  offer to its members for the absurdly small sum of five francs per  annum, the marvel is that it has not half a million members instead  of a hundred thousand.      Chapter III  Roads & Routes    [Illustration: Roads & Routes]      \"Chacun suit dans ce monde une route incertaine,    Selon que son erreur le joue et le promene.\"--Boileau    The chief concern of the automobilist to-day, after his individual  automobile, is the road question, the \"Good Roads Question,\" as it  has become generally known. In a new country, like America, it is to  be expected that great connecting highways should be mostly in the  making. It is to be regretted that the development should be so slow,  but things have been improving in the last decade, and perhaps  America will \"beat the world\" in this respect, as she has in many  others, before many future generations have been born.    In the excellence and maintenance of her roads France stands  emphatically at the head of all nations, but even here noticeable  improvement is going on. The terrific \"Louis Quatorze pave,\" which  one finds around Paris, is yearly growing less and less in quantity.  The worst road-bed in France is that awful stretch from Bordeaux, via  Bazas, to Pau in Navarre, originally due to the energy of Henri IV.,  and still in existence for a space of nearly a hundred kilometres.  One avoids it by a detour of some twenty odd kilometres, and the  writer humbly suggests that here is an important unaccomplished work  for the usually energetic road authorities of France.    After France the \"good roads\" of Britain come next, though in some  parts of the country they are woefully inadequate to accommodate the  fast-growing traffic by road, notably in London suburbs, while some  of the leafy lanes over which poets rhapsodize are so narrow that the  local laws prevent any automobile traffic whatever. As one  unfortunate individual expressed it, \"since the local authorities  forbid automobiles on roadways under sixteen feet in width, I am  unable to get my motor-car within nine miles of my home!\"    In England something has been done by late generations toward roads  improvement. The first awakening came in 1820, and in 1832 the  London-Oxford road had been so improved that the former time of the  stage-coaches had been reduced from eight to six hours. Macadam in  1830, and Stevenson in 1847, were the real fathers of the \"Roads  Improvement Movement\" in England. The great faults of English roads  are that they are narrow and winding, almost without exception. There  are 38,600 kilometres of highways (the figures are given on the  metric scale for better comparison with Continental facts and  figures) and 160,900 of by-roads. There are sixty-six kilometres of  roads to the square kilometre _(kilometre carre)_.    In Germany the roads system is very complex. In Baden, the  Palatinate, and the Grand Duchy of Hesse they cede nothing to the  best roads anywhere, but in the central and northern provinces they  are, generally speaking, much poorer. There are fifty-four kilometres  of roads of all grades to the kilometre _carre_.    In Belgium the roads are greatly inferior to those of France, and  there are immeasurable stretches of the vilest pavement the world has  known, not only near the large towns, but great interior stretches as  well. There are 17,500 kilometres of Chemins Vicinaux and 6,990  kilometres of Chemins de Grands Communications. They average, taken  together, eighty-three kilometres to the kilometre _carre_.    In Switzerland the roads are thoroughly good everywhere, but many,  particularly mountain-roads, are entirely closed to automobile  traffic, and the regulations in many of the towns are so onerous that  it is anything but agreeable to make one's way through them. There  are thirty-two kilometres to the kilometre _carre_. The Simplon Pass  has only recently (1906) been opened to automobile traffic. No  departure can be made from Brigue, on the Swiss side, or from Gondo,  in Italy, after three P.M. Speed _(vitesse)_ must not exceed ten  kilometres on the stretches, or two kilometres around the corners.  Fines for infringement of the law run from twenty to five hundred  francs.    Italy, with a surface area one-half that of France, has but a quarter  of the extent of the good roads. They are of variable quality, but  good on the main lines of travel. In the ancient kingdom of Sardinia  will be found the best, but they are poor and greatly neglected  around Naples, and, as might be expected, in Sicily.    In Austria the roads are very variable as to surface and maintenance,  and there are numerous culverts or _canivaux_ across them. There are  21,112 kilometres of national roads, 66,747 kilometres of provincial  roads, and 87,859 of local roads. They average fourteen kilometres to  the kilometre _carre_.    The history of the development of the modern roadway is too big a  subject to permit of its being treated here; suffice it to recall  that in England and France, and along the Rhine, the lines of the  twentieth-century main roads follow the Roman roads of classic times.

THE COWBIRD      The cow blackbird is a noticeable songster in April, though it takes a  back seat a little later. It utters a peculiarly liquid April sound.  Indeed, one would think its crop was full of water, its notes so bubble  up and regurgitate, and are delivered with such an apparent stomachic  contraction. This bird is the only feathered polygamist we have. The  females are greatly in excess of the males, and the latter are usually  attended by three or four of the former. As soon as the other birds  begin to build, they are on the _qui vive_, prowling about like gypsies,  not to steal the young of others, but to steal their eggs into other  birds' nests, and so shirk the labor and responsibility of hatching and  rearing their own young.    The cowbird's tactics are probably to watch the movements of the parent  bird. She may often be seen searching anxiously through the trees or  bushes for a suitable nest, yet she may still oftener be seen perched  upon some good point of observation watching the birds as they come and  go about her. There is no doubt that, in many cases, the cowbird makes  room for her own illegitimate egg in the nest by removing one of the  bird's own. I found a sparrow's nest with two sparrow's eggs and one  cowbird's egg, and another egg lying a foot or so below it on the  ground. I replaced the ejected egg, and the next day found it again  removed, and another cowbird's egg in its place. I put it back the  second time, when it was again ejected, or destroyed, for I failed to  find it anywhere. Very alert and sensitive birds, like the warblers,  often bury the strange egg beneath a second nest built on top of the  old. A lady living in the suburbs of an Eastern city heard cries of  distress one morning from a pair of house wrens that had a nest in a  honeysuckle on her front porch. On looking out of the window, she beheld  this little comedy,--comedy from her point of view, but no doubt grim  tragedy from the point of view of the wrens: a cowbird with a wren's egg  in its beak running rapidly along the walk, with the outraged wrens  forming a procession behind it, screaming, scolding, and gesticulating  as only these voluble little birds can. The cowbird had probably been  surprised in the act of violating the nest, and the wrens were giving  her a piece of their minds.    Every cowbird is reared at the expense of two or more song-birds. For  every one of these dusky little pedestrians there amid the grazing  cattle there are two or more sparrows, or vireos, or warblers, the less.  It is a big price to pay,--two larks for a bunting,--two sovereigns for  a shilling; but Nature does not hesitate occasionally to contradict  herself in just this way. The young of the cowbird is disproportionately  large and aggressive, one might say hoggish. When disturbed, it will  clasp the nest and scream and snap its beak threateningly. One was  hatched out in a song sparrow's nest which was under my observation, and  would soon have overridden and overborne the young sparrow which came  out of the shell a few hours later, had I not interfered from time to  time and lent the young sparrow a helping hand. Every day I would visit  the nest and take the sparrow out from under the potbellied interloper,  and place it on top, so that presently it was able to hold its own  against its enemy. Both birds became fledged and left the nest about the  same time. Whether the race was an even one after that, I know not.          THE CHIPPING SPARROW      When the true flycatcher catches a fly, it is quick business. There is  no strife, no pursuit,--one fell swoop, and the matter is ended. Now  note that yonder little sparrow is less skilled. It is the chippy, and  he finds his subsistence properly in various seeds and the larvae of  insects, though he occasionally has higher aspirations, and seeks to  emulate the pewee, commencing and ending his career as a flycatcher by  an awkward chase after a beetle or \"miller.\" He is hunting around in the  grass now, I suspect, with the desire to indulge this favorite whim.  There!--the opportunity is afforded him. Away goes a little  cream-colored meadow-moth in the most tortuous course he is capable of,  and away goes Chippy in pursuit. The contest is quite comical, though I  dare say it is serious enough to the moth. The chase continues for a few  yards, when there is a sudden rushing to cover in the grass,--then a  taking to wing again, when the search has become too close, and the moth  has recovered his wind. Chippy chirps angrily, and is determined not to  be beaten. Keeping, with the slightest effort, upon the heels of the  fugitive, he is ever on the point of halting to snap him up, but never  quite does it; and so, between disappointment and expectation, is soon  disgusted, and returns to pursue his more legitimate means of  subsistence.           *       *       *       *       *    Last summer I made this record in my notebook: \"A nest of young robins  in the maple in front of the house being fed by a chipping sparrow. The  little sparrow is very attentive; seems decidedly fond of her adopted  babies. The old robins resent her services, and hustle her out of the  tree whenever they find her near the nest. (It was this hurried  departure of Chippy from the tree that first attracted my attention.)  She watches her chances, and comes with food in their absence. The young  birds are about ready to fly, and when the chippy feeds them her head  fairly disappears in their capacious mouths. She jerks it back as if she  were afraid of being swallowed. Then she lingers near them on the edge  of the nest, and seems to admire them. When she sees the old robin  coming, she spreads her wings in an attitude of defense, and then flies  away. I wonder if she has had the experience of rearing a cow-bunting?\"  (A day later.) \"The robins are out of the nest, and the little sparrow  continues to feed them. She approaches them rather timidly and  hesitatingly, as if she feared they might swallow her, then thrusts her  titbit quickly into the distended mouth and jerks back.\"    Whether the chippy had lost her own brood, whether she was an unmated  bird, or whether the case was simply the overflowing of the maternal  instinct, it would be interesting to know.          THE CHEWINK      The chewink is a shy bird, but not stealthy. It is very inquisitive, and  sets up a great scratching among the leaves, apparently to attract your  attention. The male is perhaps the most conspicuously marked of all the  ground-birds except the bobolink, being black above, bay on the sides,  and white beneath. The bay is in compliment to the leaves he is forever  scratching among,--they have rustled against his breast and sides so  long that these parts have taken their color; but whence come the white  and the black? The bird seems to be aware that his color betrays him,  for there are few birds in the woods so careful about keeping themselves  screened from view. When in song, its favorite perch is the top of some  high bush near to cover. On being disturbed at such times, it pitches  down into the brush and is instantly lost to view.     [Illustration: CHEWINK   Upper, male; lower, female]    This is the bird that Thomas Jefferson wrote to Wilson about, greatly  exciting the latter's curiosity. Wilson was just then upon the threshold  of his career as an ornithologist, and had made a drawing of the Canada  jay which he sent to the President. It was a new bird, and in reply  Jefferson called his attention to a \"curious bird\" which was everywhere  to be heard, but scarcely ever to be seen. He had for twenty years  interested the young sportsmen of his neighborhood to shoot one for him,  but without success. \"It is in all the forests, from spring to fall,\" he  says in his letter, \"and never but on the tops of the tallest trees,  from which it perpetually serenades us with some of the sweetest notes,  and as clear as those of the nightingale. I have followed it for miles,  without ever but once getting a good view of it. It is of the size and  make of the mockingbird, lightly thrush-colored on the back, and a  grayish-white on the breast and belly. Mr. Randolph, my son-in-law, was  in possession of one which had been shot by a neighbor,\" etc. Randolph  pronounced it a flycatcher, which was a good way wide of the mark.  Jefferson must have seen only the female, after all his tramp, from his  description of the color; but he was doubtless following his own great  thoughts more than the bird, else he would have had an earlier view. The  bird was not a new one, but was well known then as the ground-robin. The  President put Wilson on the wrong scent by his erroneous description,  and it was a long time before the latter got at the truth of the case.  But Jefferson's letter is a good sample of those which specialists  often receive from intelligent persons who have seen or heard something  in their line very curious or entirely new, and who set the man of  science agog by a description of the"]]]
