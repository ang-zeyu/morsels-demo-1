Those who undertake to write histories, do not, I perceive, take that  trouble on one and the same account, but for many reasons, and those  such as are very different one from another. For some of them apply  themselves to this part of learning to show their skill in composition,  and that they may therein acquire a reputation for speaking finely:  others of them there are, who write histories in order to gratify those  that happen to be concerned in them, and on that account have spared no  pains, but rather gone beyond their own abilities in the performance:  but others there are, who, of necessity and by force, are driven to  write history, because they are concerned in the facts, and so cannot  excuse themselves from committing them to writing, for the advantage of  posterity; nay, there are not a few who are induced to draw their  historical facts out of darkness into light, and to produce them for the  benefit of the public, on account of the great importance of the facts  themselves with which they have been concerned. Now of these several  reasons for writing history, I must profess the two last were my own  reasons also; for since I was myself interested in that war which we  Jews had with the Romans, and knew myself its particular actions, and  what conclusion it had, I was forced to give the history of it, because  I saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their  writings.    2. Now I have undertaken the present work, as thinking it will appear to  all the Greeks 2 worthy of their study; for it will contain all our  antiquities, and the constitution of our government, as interpreted out  of the Hebrew Scriptures. And indeed I did formerly intend, when I wrote  of the war, 3 to explain who the Jews originally were,what fortunes  they had been subject to,and by what legislature they had been  instructed in piety, and the exercise of other virtues,what wars also  they had made in remote ages, till they were unwillingly engaged in this  last with the Romans: but because this work would take up a great  compass, I separated it into a set treatise by itself, with a beginning  of its own, and its own conclusion; but in process of time, as usually  happens to such as undertake great things, I grew weary and went on  slowly, it being a large subject, and a difficult thing to translate our  history into a foreign, and to us unaccustomed language. However, some  persons there were who desired to know our history, and so exhorted me  to go on with it; and, above all the rest, Epaphroditus, 4 a man who is  a lover of all kind of learning, but is principally delighted with the  knowledge of history, and this on account of his having been himself  concerned in great affairs, and many turns of fortune, and having shown  a wonderful rigor of an excellent nature, and an immovable virtuous  resolution in them all. I yielded to this man's persuasions, who always  excites such as have abilities in what is useful and acceptable, to join  their endeavors with his. I was also ashamed myself to permit any  laziness of disposition to have a greater influence upon me, than the  delight of taking pains in such studies as were very useful: I thereupon  stirred up myself, and went on with my work more cheerfully. Besides the  foregoing motives, I had others which I greatly reflected on; and these  were, that our forefathers were willing to communicate such things to  others; and that some of the Greeks took considerable pains to know the  affairs of our nation.    3. I found, therefore, that the second of the Ptolemies was a king who  was extraordinarily diligent in what concerned learning, and the  collection of books; that he was also peculiarly ambitious to procure a  translation of our law, and of the constitution of our government  therein contained, into the Greek tongue. Now Eleazar the high priest,  one not inferior to any other of that dignity among us, did not envy the  forenamed king the participation of that advantage, which otherwise he  would for certain have denied him, but that he knew the custom of our  nation was, to hinder nothing of what we esteemed ourselves from being  communicated to others. Accordingly, I thought it became me both to  imitate the generosity of our high priest, and to suppose there might  even now be many lovers of learning like the king; for he did not obtain  all our writings at that time; but those who were sent to Alexandria as  interpreters, gave him only the books of the law, while there were a  vast number of other matters in our sacred books. They, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#5)"],[1,"years, and reigned  nine years. Now four sons of his nurse plotted against him and slew him,  the eldest of whom reigned twelve years: after them came Astartus,  the son of Deleastartus; he lived fifty-four years, and reigned twelve  years: after him came his brother Aserymus; he lived fifty-four years,  and reigned nine years: he was slain by his brother Pheles, who took the  kingdom and reigned but eight months, though he lived fifty years: he  was slain by Ithobalus, the priest of Astarte, who reigned thirty-two  years, and lived sixty-eight years: he was succeeded by his son  Badezorus, who lived forty-five years, and reigned six years: he was  succeeded by Matgenus his son; he lived thirty-two years, and reigned  nine years: Pygmalion succeeded him; he lived fifty-six years, and  reigned forty-seven years. Now in the seventh year of his reign, his  sister fled away from him, and built the city Carthage in Libya.\" So  the whole time from the reign of Hirom, till the building of Carthage,  amounts to the sum of one hundred fifty-five years and eight months.  Since then the temple was built at Jerusalem in the twelfth year of the  reign of Hirom, there were from the building of the temple, until the  building of Carthage, one hundred forty-three years and eight months.  Wherefore, what occasion is there for alleging any more testimonies out  of the Phoenician histories [on the behalf of our nation], since what  I have said is so thoroughly confirmed already? and to be sure our  ancestors came into this country long before the building of the temple;  for it was not till we had gotten possession of the whole land by war  that we built our temple. And this is the point that I have clearly  proved out of our sacred writings in my Antiquities.    19. I will now relate what hath been written concerning us in the  Chaldean histories, which records have a great agreement with our books  in oilier things also. Berosus shall be witness to what I say: he was  by birth a Chaldean, well known by the learned, on account of his  publication of the Chaldean books of astronomy and philosophy among the  Greeks. This Berosus, therefore, following the most ancient records  of that nation, gives us a history of the deluge of waters that then  happened, and of the destruction of mankind thereby, and agrees with  Moses's narration thereof. He also gives us an account of that ark  wherein Noah, the origin of our race, was preserved, when it was brought  to the highest part of the Armenian mountains; after which he gives us  a catalogue of the posterity of Noah, and adds the years of their  chronology, and at length comes down to Nabolassar, who was king of  Babylon, and of the Chaldeans. And when he was relating the acts of  this king, he describes to us how he sent his son Nabuchodonosor against  Egypt, and against our land, with a great army, upon his being informed  that they had revolted from him; and how, by that means, he subdued them  all, and set our temple that was at Jerusalem on fire; nay, and removed  our people entirely out of their own country, and transferred them  to Babylon; when it so happened that our city was desolate during the  interval of seventy years, until the days of Cyrus king of Persia. He  then says, \"That this Babylonian king conquered Egypt, and Syria, and  Phoenicia, and Arabia, and exceeded in his exploits all that had  reigned before him in Babylon and Chaldea.\" A little after which Berosus  subjoins what follows in his History of Ancient Times. I will set down  Berosus's own accounts, which are these: \"When Nabolassar, father of  Nabuchodonosor, heard that the governor whom he had set over Egypt, and  over the parts of Celesyria and Phoenicia, had revolted from him, he was  not able to bear it any longer; but committing certain parts of his army  to his son Nabuchodonosor, who was then but young, he sent him against  the rebel: Nabuchodonosor joined battle with him, and conquered him, and  reduced the country under his dominion again. Now it so fell out that  his father Nabolassar fell into a distemper at this time, and died in  the city of Babylon, after he had reigned twenty-nine years. But as he  understood, in a little time, that his father Nabolassar was dead, he  set the affairs of Egypt and the other countries in order, and committed  the captives he had taken from the Jews, and Phoenicians, and Syrians,  and of the nations belonging to Egypt, to some of his friends, that they  might conduct that part of the forces that had on heavy armor, with the  rest of his baggage, to Babylonia; while he went in haste, having but a  few with him, over the desert to Babylon; whither, when he was come, he  found the public affairs had been managed by the Chaldeans, and that  the principal person among them had preserved the kingdom for him.  Accordingly, he now entirely obtained all his father's dominions. He  then came, and ordered the captives to be placed as colonies in the most  proper places of Babylonia; but for himself, he adorned the temple of  Belus, and the other temples, after an elegant manner, out of the  spoils he had taken in this war. He also rebuilt the old city, and added  another to it on the outside, and so far restored Babylon, that none who  should besiege it afterwards might have it in their power to divert  the river, so as to facilitate an entrance into it; and this he did by  building three walls about the inner city, and three about the outer.  Some of these walls he built of burnt brick and bitumen, and some of  brick only. So when he had thus fortified the city with walls, after an  excellent manner, and had adorned the gates magnificently, he added a  new palace to that which his father had dwelt in, and this close by it  also, and that more eminent in its height, and in its great splendor. It  would perhaps require too long a narration, if any one were to describe  it. However, as prodigiously large and as magnificent as it was, it was  finished in fifteen days. Now in this palace he erected very high walks,  supported by stone pillars, and by planting what was called a pensile  paradise, and replenishing it with all sorts of trees, he rendered the  prospect an exact resemblance of a mountainous country. This he did to  please his queen, because she had been brought up in Media, and was fond  of a mountainous situation.\"    20. This is what Berosus relates concerning the forementioned king, as  he relates many other things about him also in the third book of his  Chaldean History; wherein he complains of the Grecian writers for  supposing, without any foundation, that Babylon was built by Semiramis,  [14] queen of Assyria, and for her false pretense to those wonderful  edifices thereto buildings at Babylon, do no way contradict those  ancient and relating, as if they were her own workmanship; as indeed  in these affairs the Chaldean History cannot but be the most credible.  Moreover, we meet with a confirmation of what Berosus says in the  archives of the Phoenicians, concerning this king Nabuchodonosor, that  he conquered all Syria and Phoenicia; in which case Philostratus agrees  with the others in that history which he composed, where he mentions  the siege of Tyre; as does Megasthenes also, in the fourth book of his  Indian History, wherein he pretends to prove that the forementioned  king of the Babylonians was superior to Hercules in strength and the  greatness of his exploits; for he says that he conquered a great part  of Libya, and conquered Iberia also. Now as to what I have said before  about the temple at Jerusalem, that it was fought against by the  Babylonians, and burnt by them, but was opened again when Cyrus had  taken the kingdom of Asia, shall now be demonstrated from what Berosus  adds further upon that head; for thus he says in his third book:  \"Nabuchodonosor, after he had begun to build the forementioned wall,  fell sick, and departed this life, when he had reigned forty-three  years; whereupon his son Evilmerodach obtained the kingdom. He governed  public affairs after an illegal and impure manner, and had a plot laid  against him by Neriglissoor, his sister's husband, and was slain by him  when he had reigned but two years. After he was slain, Neriglissoor,  the person who plotted against him, succeeded him in the kingdom, and  reigned four years; his son Laborosoarchod obtained the kingdom, though  he was but a child, and kept it nine mouths; but by reason of the very  ill temper and ill practices he exhibited to the world, a plot was laid  against him also by his friends, and he was tormented to death. After  his death, the conspirators got together, and by common consent put  the crown upon the head of Nabonnedus, a man of Babylon, and one who  belonged to that insurrection. In his reign it was that the walls of the  city of Babylon were curiously built with burnt brick and bitumen; but  when he was come to the seventeenth year of his reign, Cyrus came out of  Persia with a great army; and having already conquered all the rest of  Asia, he came hastily to Babylonia. When Nabonnedus perceived he was  coming to attack him, he met him with his forces, and joining battle  with him was beaten, and fled away with a few of his troops with him,  and was shut up within the city Borsippus. Hereupon Cyrus took Babylon,  and gave order that the outer walls of the city should be demolished,  because the city had proved very troublesome to him, and cost him a  great deal of pains to take it. He then marched away to Borsippus, to  besiege Nabonnedus; but as Nabonnedus did not sustain the siege, but  delivered himself into his hands, he was at first kindly used by Cyrus,  who gave him Carmania, as a place for him to inhabit in, but sent him  out of Babylonia. Accordingly Nabonnedus spent the rest of his time in  that country, and there died.\"    21. These accounts agree with the true histories in our books; for in  them it is written that Nebuchadnezzar,"]]]
