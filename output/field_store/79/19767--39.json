The names of Colchis, Chaldea,  Assyria, Iberia, Thrace, may indicate the origin of a great part  of the Hellenic sorceries. Yet, if the more honourable science  may have been of foreign extraction, Hellas was not without  something of the sorcery of modern Europe. The infernal goddess  Hecate, of Greek celebrity, is the omnipotent patroness of her  modern Christian slaves; and she presides at the witch meetings  of Christendom with as much solemnity but with far greater  malice. Originally of celestial rank, by a later metamorphosis  connected, if not personally identical with, Persephone,  the Queen of Hades, Hecate was invested with many of the  characteristic attributes of a modern devil, or rather perhaps of  a witch. The triple goddess, in her various shapes, wandered  about at night with the souls of the dead, terrifying the  trembling country people by apparitions of herself and infernal  satellites, by the horrible whining and howls of her hellhounds  which always announced her approach. She frequented cross-roads,  tombs, and melancholy places, especially delighting in localities  famous for deeds of blood and murder. The hobgoblins, the various  malicious demons and spirits, who provoked the lively terrors of  the mediaeval peoples, had some prototypes in the fairy-land of  Greece, in the Hecatean hobgoblins (like the Latin larvae, &c.),  Empusa, Mormo, and other products of an affrighted imagination  familiar to the students of Greek literature in the comic pages  of Aristophanes.[18] From the earliest literary records down to  the latest times of paganism as the state religion, from the  times of the Homeric Circe and Ulysses (the latter has been  recognised by many as a genuine wizard) to the age of Apollonius  or Apuleius, magic and sorcery, as a philosophical science or as  a vulgar superstition, had apparently more or less distinctly a  place in the popular mythology of old Greece. But in the pagan  history of neither Greece nor Rome do we read of holocausts of  victims, as in Christian Europe, immolated on the altars of a  horrid superstition.[19] The occasion of the composition of the  treatise by Apuleius 'On Magic' is somewhat romantic. On his way  to Alexandria, the philosopher, being disabled from proceeding on  the journey, was hospitably received into the mansion of one  Sicinius Pontianus. Here, during the interesting period of his  recovery, he captivated, or was captivated by, the love of his  host's mother, a wealthy widow, and the lovers were soon united  by marriage. Pudentilla's relatives, indignant at the loss of a  much-coveted, and perhaps long-expected fortune, brought an  action against Apuleius for having gained her affection by means  of spells or charms. The cause was heard before the proconsul of  Africa, and the apology of the accused labours to convince his  judges that a widow's love might be provoked without superhuman  means.[20]      [18] Particularly in the _Batrachoi_. The dread of the    infernal apparition of the fierce Gorgo in Hades blanched    the cheek of even much-daring Odysseus (Od. xi. 633). The    satellites of Hecate have been compared, not    disadvantageously, with the monstrous guardians of hell;    than whom           'Nor uglier follow the night-hag when, called          In secret, riding through the air she comes          Lured with the smell of infant blood to dance          With Lapland witches--.'      [19] An exceptional case, on the authority of Demosthenes,    is that of a woman condemned in the year, or within a year    or two, of the execution of Socrates.      [20] St. Augustin, in denouncing the Platonic theories of    Apuleius, of the mediation and intercession of demons    between gods and men, and exposing his magic heresies, takes    occasion to taunt him with having evaded his just fate by    not professing, like the Christian martyrs, his real faith    when delivering his 'very copious and eloquent' apology (_De    Civitate Dei_, lib. viii. 19). In the _Golden Ass_ of the    Greek romancist of the second century, who, in common with    his cotemporary the great rationalist Lucian, deserves the    praise of having exposed (with more wit perhaps than    success) some of the most absurd prejudices of the day, his    readers are entertained with stories that might pretty    nearly represent the sentiments of the seventeenth century.    Gibbon observes of the Roman superstition on the authority of  Petronius, that it may be inferred that it was of Italian rather  than barbaric extraction. Etruria furnished the people of Romulus  with the science of divination. Early in the history of the  Republic the law is very explicit on the subject of witchcraft.  In the decemviral code the extreme penalty is attached to the  crime of witchcraft or conjuration: 'Let him be capitally  punished who shall have bewitched the fruits of the earth, or by  either kind of conjuration (_excantando neque incantando_) shall  have conjured away his neighbour's corn into his own field,' &c.,  an enactment sneered at in Justinian's _Institutes_ in Seneca's  words. A rude and ignorant antiquity, repeat the lawyers of  Justinian, had believed that rain and storms might be attracted  or repelled by means of spells or charms, the impossibility of  which has no need to be explained by any school of philosophy. A  hundred and fifty years later than the legislation of the  decemvirs was passed the _Lex Cornelia_, usually cited as  directed against sorcery: but while involving possibly the more  shadowy crime, it seems to have been levelled against the more  'substantial poison.' The conviction and condemnation of 170  Roman ladies for poisoning, under pretence of incantation, was  the occasion and cause. Sulla, when dictator, revived this act  _de veneficiis et malis sacrificiis_, for breach of which the  penalty was 'interdiction of fire and water.' Senatorial  anathemas, or even those of the prince, were ineffective to check  the continually increasing abuses, which towards the end of the  first century of the empire had reached an alarming height.[21]      [21] It will be observed that _veneficus and maleficus_ are    the significant terms among the Italians for the criminals.    A general degradation of morals is often accompanied, it has been  justly remarked, by a corresponding increase of the wildest  credulity, and by an abject subservience to external religious  rites in propitiation of an incensed deity. It was thus at Rome  when the eloquence of Cicero, and afterwards the indignant satire  of Juvenal or the calm ridicule of the philosophic Lucian,[22]  attempted to assert the 'proper authority of reason.' To speak  the truth, says Cicero, superstition has spread like a torrent  over the entire globe, oppressing the minds and intellects of  almost all men and seizing upon the weakness of human nature.[23]  The historian of 'The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'  justifies and illustrates this lament of the philosopher of the  Republic in the particular case of witchcraft. 'The nations and  the sects of the Roman world admitted with equal credulity and  similar abhorrence the reality of that infernal art which was  able to control the eternal order of the planets, and the  voluntary operations of the human mind. They dreaded the  mysterious power of spells and incantations, of potent herbs and  execrable rites, which could extinguish or recall life, influence  the passions of the soul, blast the works of creation, and extort  from the reluctant demons the secrets of Futurity. They believed  with the wildest inconsistency that the preternatural dominion of  the air, of earth, and of hell, was exercised from the vilest  motives of malice or gain by some wrinkled hags or itinerant  sorcerers who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt.  Such vain terrors disturbed the peace of society and the  happiness of individuals; and the harmless flame which insensibly  melted a waxen image might derive a powerful and pernicious  energy from the affrighted fancy of the person whom it was  maliciously designed to represent. From the infusion of those  herbs which were supposed to possess a supernatural influence, it  was an easy step to the case of more substantial poison; and the  folly of mankind sometimes became the instrument and the mask of  the most atrocious crimes.'[24]      [22] If the philosophical arguments of Menippus (_Nekrikoi    Dialogoi_) could have satisfied the interest of the priests    or the ignorance of the people of after times, the    _infernal_ fires of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries    might not have burned.      [23] _De Divinatione_, lib. ii.      [24] _The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman    Empire_, xxv. This description applies more to the Christian    and later empires.    Latin poetry of the Augustan and succeeding period abounds with  illustrations, and the witches of Horace, Ovid, and Lucan are the  famous classical types.[25] Propertius has characterised the  Striga as 'daring enough to impose laws upon the moon bewitched  by her spells;' while Petronius makes his witch, as potent as  Strepsiades' Thessalian sorceress, exclaim that the very form of  the moon herself is compelled to descend from her position in the  universe at her command. For the various compositions and  incantations in common use, it must be sufficient to refer to the  pages of the Roman poets. The forms of incantation and horrid  rites of the Horatian Sagana Canidia (_Epod._ v. and _Sat._ i.  8), or the scenes described by the pompous verses of the poet  of the civil war (_De Bello Civili_, vi.), where all nature is  subservient, are of a similar kind, but more familiar, in  the dramatic writings of the Elizabethan age. The darker  characteristics of the practice, however, are presented in the  burning declamations of Juvenal, only too faithfully exhibiting  the unnatural atrocities perpetrated in the form and under the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#5)"],[1,"to call the Chief Good by the term Happiness, although  there may be unlimited diversity of opinion as to its nature, and the  means to attain it. The truth of (b) also becomes apparent if the matter  is carefully reflected upon. Everything that is _en rapport_ with all  other things: the pebble cast from the hand alters the centre of gravity  in the Universe. As in the world of things and acts, so in the world of  thought, from which all action springs. Nothing can happen to the part  but the whole gains or suffers as a consequence. Every breeze that  blows, every cry that is uttered, every thought that is born, affects  through perpetual metamorphoses every part of the entire Cosmic  Existence.[2]    We deduce from these postulates the following ethical precepts: a wise  man will, firstly, so regulate his conduct that thereby he may  experience the greatest happiness; secondly, he will endeavour to bestow  happiness on others that by so doing he may receive, indirectly, being  himself a part of the Cosmic Whole, the happiness he gives. Thus supreme  selfishness is synonymous with supreme egoism, a truth that can only be  stated paradoxically.    Applying this latter precept to the matter in hand, it is obvious that  since we should so live as to give the greatest possible happiness to  all beings capable of appreciating it, and as it is an indisputable  fact that animals can suffer pain, _and that men who slaughter animals  needlessly suffer from atrophy of all finer feelings_, we should  therefore cause no unnecessary suffering in the animal world. Let us  then consider whether, knowing flesh to be unnecessary as an article of  diet, we are, in continuing to demand and eat flesh-food, acting morally  or not. To answer this query is not difficult.    It is hardly necessary to say that we are causing a great deal of  suffering among animals in breeding, raising, transporting, and killing  them for food. It is sometimes said that animals do not suffer if they  are handled humanely, and if they are slaughtered in abattoirs under  proper superintendence. But we must not forget the branding and  castrating operations; the journey to the slaughter-house, which when  trans-continental and trans-oceanic must be a long drawn-out nightmare  of horror and terror to the doomed beasts; we must not forget the  insatiable cruelty of the average cowboy; we must not forget that the  animal inevitably spends at least some minutes of instinctive dread and  fear when he smells and sees the spilt blood of his forerunners, and  that this terror is intensified when, as is frequently the case, he  witnesses the dying struggles, and hears the heart-rending groans; we  must not forget that the best contrivances sometimes fail to do good  work, and that a certain percentage of victims have to suffer a  prolonged death-agony owing to the miscalculation of a bad workman. Most  people go through life without thinking of these things: they do not  stop and consider from whence and by what means has come to their table  the flesh-food that is served there. They drift along through a mundane  existence without feeling a pang of remorse for, or even thought of, the  pain they are accomplices in producing in the sub-human world. And it  cannot be denied, hide it how we may, either from our eyes or our  conscience, that however skilfully the actual killing may usually be  carried out, there is much unavoidable suffering caused to the beasts  that have to be transported by sea and rail to the slaughter-house. The  animals suffer violently from sea-sickness, and horrible cruelty (such  as pouring boiling oil into their ears, and stuffing their ears with hay  which is then set on fire, tail-twisting, etc.,) has to be practised to  prevent them lying down lest they be trampled on by other beasts and  killed; for this means that they have to be thrown overboard, thus  reducing the profits of their owners, or of the insurance companies,  which, of course, would be a sad calamity. Judging by the way the men  act it does not seem to matter what cruelties and tortures are  perpetuated; what heinous offenses against every humane sentiment of the  human heart are committed; it does not matter to what depths of Satanic  callousness man stoops provided always that--this is the supreme  question--_there is money to be made by it_.    A writer has thus graphically described the scene in a cattle-boat in  rough weather: 'Helpless cattle dashed from one side of the ship to the  other, amid a ruin of smashed pens, with limbs broken from contact with  hatchway combings or winches--dishorned, gored, and some of them smashed  to mere bleeding masses of hide-covered flesh. Add to this the shrieking  of the tempest, and the frenzied moanings of the wounded beasts, and the  reader will have some faint idea of the fearful scenes of danger and  carnage ... the dead beasts, advanced, perhaps, in decomposition before  death ended their sufferings, are often removed literally in pieces.'    And on the railway journey, though perhaps the animals do not experience  so much physical pain as travelling by sea, yet they are often deprived  of food, and water, and rest, for long periods, and mercilessly knocked  about and bruised. They are often so injured that the cattle-men are  surprised they have not succumbed to their injuries. And all this  happens in order that the demand for _unnecessary_ flesh-food may be  satisfied.    Those who defend flesh-eating often talk of humane methods of  slaughtering; but it is significant that there is considerable  difference of opinion as to what _is_ the most humane method. In England  the pole-axe is used; in Germany the mallet; the Jews cut the throat;  the Italians stab. It is obvious that each of these methods cannot be  better than the others, yet the advocates of each method consider the  others cruel. As Lieut. Powell remarks, this 'goes far to show that a  great deal of cruelty and suffering is inseparable from all methods.'    It is hard to imagine how anyone believing he could live healthily on  vegetable food alone, could, having once considered these things,  continue a meat-eater. At least to do so he could not live his life in  conformity with the precept that we should cause no unnecessary pain.      How unholy a custom, how easy a way to murder he makes for himself    Who cuts the innocent throat of the calf, and hears unmoved its      mournful plaint!    And slaughters the little kid, whose cry is like the cry of a child,    Or devours the birds of the air which his own hands have fed!    Ah, how little is wanting to fill the cup of his wickedness!    What unrighteous deed is he not ready to commit.           *       *       *       *       *      Make war on noxious creatures, and kill them only,    But let your mouths be empty of blood, and satisfied with pure      and natural repasts.                                           OVID. _Metam._, _lib._ xv.    That we cannot find any justification for destroying animal life for  food does not imply we should never destroy animal life. Such a cult  would be pure fanaticism. If we are to consider physical well-being as  of primary importance, it follows that we shall act in  self-preservation 'making war on noxious creatures.' But this again is  no justification for 'blood-sports.'    He who inflicts pain needlessly, whether by his own hand or by that of  an accomplice, not only injures his victim, but injures himself. He  stifles what nobleness of character he may have and he cultivates  depravity and barbarism. He destroys in himself the spirit of true  religion and isolates himself from those whose lives are made beautiful  by sympathy. No one need hope for a spiritual Heaven while helping to  make the earth a bloody Hell. No one who asks others to do wrong for him  need imagine he escapes the punishment meted out to wrong-doers. That he  procures the service of one whose sensibilities are less keen than his  own to procure flesh-food for him that he may gratify his depraved taste  and love of conformity does not make him less guilty of crime. Were he  to kill with his own hand, and himself dress and prepare the obscene  food, the evil would be less, for then he would not be an accomplice in  retarding the spiritual growth of a fellow being. There is no shame in  any _necessary_ labour, but that which is unnecessary is unmoral, and  slaughtering animals to eat their flesh is not only unnecessary and  unmoral; it is also cruel and immoral. Philosophers and  transcendentalists who believe in the Buddhist law of Karma, Westernized  by Emerson and Carlyle into the great doctrine of Compensation, realize  that every act of unkindness, every deed that is contrary to the  dictates of our nobler instincts and reason, reacts upon us, and we  shall truly reap that which we have sown. An act of brutality  brutalizes, and the more we become brutalized the more we attract  natures similarly brutal and get treated by them brutally. Thus does  Nature sternly deal justice.    'Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,  Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.'    It is appropriate in this place to point out that some very pointed  things are said in the Bible against the killing and eating of animals.  It has been said that it is possible by judiciously selecting quotations  to find the Bible support almost anything. However this may be, the  following excerpta are of interest:--    'And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, and  every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed, to you it  shall be for meat.'--Gen. i., 29.    'But flesh with life thereof, which is the blood thereof, ye shall not  eat.'--Gen. ix., 4.    'It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your  dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.'--Lev. iii., 17.    'Ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl, or  beast.'--Lev. vii., 26.    '"]]]
