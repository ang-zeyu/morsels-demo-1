But  in neither instance can we call this helpfulness entirely  disinterested, or pure altruism.    Emerson said that he was an endless experimenter with no past at his  back. This is just what Nature is. She experiments endlessly, seeking  new ways, new modes, new forms, and is ever intent upon breaking away  from the past. In this way, as Darwin showed, she attains to new  species. She is blind, she gropes her way, she trusts to luck; all her  successes are chance hits. Whenever I look over my right shoulder, as  I sit at my desk writing these sentences, I see a long shoot of a  honeysuckle that came in through a crack of my imperfectly closed  window last summer. It came in looking, or rather feeling, for  something to cling to. It first dropped down upon a pile of books,  then reached off till it struck the window-sill of another large  window; along this it crept, its regular leaves standing up like so  many pairs of green ears, looking very pretty. Coming to the end of  the open way there, it turned to the left and reached out into  vacancy, till it struck another window-sill running at right angles to  the former; along this it traveled nearly half an inch a day, till it  came to the end of that road. Then it ventured out into vacant space  again, and pointed straight toward me at my desk, ten feet distant.  Day by day it kept its seat upon the window-sill, and stretched out  farther and farther, almost beckoning me to give it a lift or to bring  it support. I could hardly resist its patient daily appeal. Late in  October it had bridged about three feet of the distance that separated  us, when, one day, the moment came when it could maintain itself  outright in the air no longer, and it fell to the floor. \"Poor thing,\"  I said, \"your faith was blind, but it was real. You knew there was a  support somewhere, and you tried all ways to find it.\" This is Nature.  She goes around the circle, she tries every direction, sure that she  will find a way at some point. Animals in cages behave in a similar  way, looking for a means of escape. In the vineyard I see the  grape-vines reaching out blindly in all directions for some hold for  their tendrils. The young arms seize upon one another and tighten  their hold as if they had at last found what they were in search of.  Stop long enough beside one of the vines, and it will cling to you and  run all over you.    Behold the tumble-bug with her ball of dung by the roadside; where is  she going with it? She is going anywhere and everywhere; she changes  her direction, like the vine, whenever she encounters an obstacle. She  only knows that somewhere there is a depression or a hole in which her  ball with its egg can rest secure, and she keeps on tumbling about  till she finds it, or maybe digs one, or comes to grief by the foot of  some careless passer-by. This, again, is Nature's way, randomly and  tirelessly seeking her ends. When we look over a large section of  history, we see that it is man's way, too, or Nature's way in man. His  progress has been a blind groping, the result of endless  experimentation, and all his failures and mistakes could not be  written in a book. How he has tumbled about with his ball, seeking the  right place for it, and how many times has he come to grief! All his  successes have been lucky hits: steam, electricity, representative  government, printing--how long he groped for them before he found  them! There is always and everywhere the Darwinian tendency to  variation, to seek new forms, to improve upon the past; and man is  under this law, the same as is the rest of nature. One generation of  men, like one generation of leaves, becomes the fertilizer of the  next; failures only enrich the soil or make smoother the way.    There are so many conflicting forces and interests, and the conditions  of success are so complex! If the seed fall here, it will not  germinate; if there, it will be drowned or washed away; if yonder, it  will find too sharp competition. There are only a few places where it  will find all the conditions favorable. Hence the prodigality of  Nature in seeds, scattering a thousand for one plant or tree. She is  like a hunter shooting at random into every tree or bush, hoping to  bring down his game, which he does if his ammunition holds out long  enough; or like the British soldier in the Boer War, firing vaguely at  an enemy that he does not see. But Nature's ammunition always holds  out, and she hits her mark in the end. Her ammunition on our planet is  the heat of the sun. When this fails, she will no longer hit the mark  or try to hit it.    Let there be a plum tree anywhere with the disease called the  \"black-knot\" upon it, and presently every plum tree in its  neighborhood will have black knots. Do you think the germs from the  first knot knew where to find the other plum trees? No; the wind  carried them in every direction, where the plum trees were not as well  as where they were. It was a blind search and a chance hit. So with  all seeds and germs. Nature covers all the space, and is bound to hit  the mark sooner or later. The sun spills his light indiscriminately  into space; a small fraction of his rays hit the earth, and we are  warmed. Yet to all intents and purposes it is as if he shone for us  alone.                                            II                                  BIRD-SONGS      I suspect it requires a special gift of grace to enable one to hear  the bird-songs; some new power must be added to the ear, or some  obstruction removed. There are not only scales upon our eyes so that  we do not see, there are scales upon our ears so that we do not hear.  A city woman who had spent much of her time in the country once asked  a well-known ornithologist to take her where she could hear the  bluebird. \"What, never heard the bluebird!\" said he. \"I have not,\"  said the woman. \"Then you will never hear it,\" said the bird-lover;  never hear it with that inward ear that gives beauty and meaning to  the note. He could probably have taken her in a few minutes where she  could have heard the call or warble of the bluebird; but it would have  fallen upon unresponsive ears--upon ears that were not sensitized by  love for the birds or associations with them. Bird-songs are not  music, properly speaking, but only suggestions of music. A great many  people whose attention would be quickly arrested by the same volume of  sound made by a musical instrument or by artificial means never hear  them at all. The sound of a boy's penny whistle there in the grove or  the meadow would separate itself more from the background of nature,  and be a greater challenge to the ear, than is the strain of the  thrush or the song of the sparrow. There is something elusive,  indefinite, neutral, about bird-songs that makes them strike  obliquely, as it were, upon the ear; and we are very apt to miss them.  They are a part of nature, the Nature that lies about us, entirely  occupied with her own affairs, and quite regardless of our presence.  Hence it is with bird-songs as it is with so many other things in  nature--they are what we make them; the ear that hears them must be  half creative. I am always disturbed when persons not especially  observant of birds ask me to take them where they can hear a  particular bird, in whose song they have become interested through a  description in some book. As I listen with them, I feel like  apologizing for the bird: it has a bad cold, or has just heard some  depressing news; it will not let itself out. The song seems so casual  and minor when you make a dead set at it. I have taken persons to hear  the hermit thrush, and I have fancied that they were all the time  saying to themselves, \"Is that all?\" But should one hear the bird in  his walk, when the mind is attuned to simple things and is open and  receptive, when expectation is not aroused and the song comes as a  surprise out of the dusky silence of the woods, then one feels that  it merits all the fine things that can be said of it.    One of our popular writers and lecturers upon birds told me this  incident: He had engaged to take two city girls out for a walk in the  country, to teach them the names of the birds they might see and hear.  Before they started, he read to them Henry van Dyke's poem on the song  sparrow,--one of our best bird-poems,--telling them that the song  sparrow was one of the first birds they were likely to hear. As they  proceeded with their walk, sure enough, there by the roadside was a  sparrow in song. The bird man called the attention of his companions  to it. It was some time before the unpracticed ears of the girls could  make it out; then one of them said (the poem she had just heard, I  suppose, still ringing in her ears), \"What! that little squeaky  thing?\" The sparrow's song meant nothing to her at all, and how could  she share the enthusiasm of the poet? Probably the warble of the  robin, or the call of the meadowlark or of the highhole, if they  chanced to hear them, meant no more to these girls. If we have no  associations with these sounds, they will mean very little to us.  Their merit as musical performances is very slight. It is as signs of  joy and love in nature, as heralds of spring, and as the spirit of the  woods and fields made audible, that they appeal to us. The drumming of  the woodpeckers and of the ruffed grouse give great pleasure to a  countryman, though these sounds have not the quality of real music. It  is the same with the call of the migrating geese or the voice of any  wild thing: our pleasure in them is entirely apart from any  considerations of music.

To-day under the republic, without a court, with a society kept in  funds by the self-expatriated wives and daughters of our business men,  she lacks the reasons for which Baron Haussmann bedecked her and made  her beautiful. The good Loubet, the worthy Fallieres, except that they  furnish the cartoonist with subjects for ridicule, do not add to the  gayety of Paris. But when Harden-Hickey was a boy, Paris was never so  carelessly gay, so brilliant, never so overcharged with life, color, and  adventure.    In those days \"the Emperor sat in his box that night,\" and in the box  opposite sat Cora Pearl; veterans of the campaign of Italy, of Mexico,  from the desert fights of Algiers, sipped sugar and water in front of  Tortoni's, the Cafe Durand, the Cafe Riche; the sidewalks rang with  their sabres, the boulevards were filled with the colors of the gorgeous  uniforms; all night of each night the Place Vendome shone with the  carriage lamps of the visiting pashas from Egypt, of nabobs from  India, of _rastaquoueres_ from the sister empire of Brazil; the state  carriages, with the outriders and postilions in the green and gold of  the Empress, swept through the Champs Elysees, and at the Bal Bulier,  and at Mabile the students and \"grisettes\" introduced the cancan. The  men of those days were Hugo, Thiers, Dumas, Daudet, Alfred de Musset;  the magnificent blackguard, the Duc de Morny, and the great, simple  Canrobert, the captain of barricades, who became a marshal of France.    Over all was the mushroom Emperor, his anterooms crowded with the  titled charlatans of Europe, his court radiant with countesses created  overnight. And it was the Emperor, with his love of theatrical display,  of gorgeous ceremonies; with his restless reaching after military glory,  the weary, cynical adventurer, that the boy at St. Cyr took as his  model.    Royalist as was Harden-Hickey by birth and tradition, and Royalist as  he always remained, it was the court at the Tuileries that filled his  imagination. The Bourbons, whom he served, hoped some day for a court;  at the Tuileries there was a court, glittering before his physical eyes.  The Bourbons were pleasant old gentlemen, who later willingly supported  him, and for whom always he was equally willing to fight, either with  his sword or his pen. But to the last, in his mind, he carried pictures  of the Second Empire as he, as a boy, had known it.    Can you not imagine the future James the First, barelegged, in a  black-belted smock, halting with his nurse, or his priest, to gaze up in  awestruck delight at the great, red-breeched Zouaves lounging on guard  at the Tuileries?    \"When I grow up,\" said little James to himself, not knowing that he  never would grow up, \"I shall have Zouaves for _my_ palace guard.\"    And twenty years later, when he laid down the laws for his little  kingdom, you find that the officers of his court must wear the mustache,  \"_a la_ Louis Napoleon,\" and that the Zouave uniform will be worn by the  Palace Guards.    In 1883, while he still was at the War College, his father died, and  when he graduated, which he did with honors, he found himself his own  master. His assets were a small income, a perfect knowledge of the  French language, and the reputation of being one of the most expert  swordsman in Paris. He chose not to enter the army, and instead became  a journalist, novelist, duellist, an _habitue_ of the Latin Quarter and  the boulevards.    As a novelist the titles of his books suggest their quality. Among  them are: \"Un Amour Vendeen,\" \"Lettres d'un Yankee,\" \"Un Amour dans  le Monde,\" \"Memoires d'un Gommeux,\" \"Merveilleuses Aventures de  Nabuchodonosor, Nosebreaker.\"    Of the Catholic Church he wrote seriously, apparently with deep  conviction, with high enthusiasm. In her service as a defender of the  faith he issued essays, pamphlets, \"broadsides.\" The opponents of the  Church in Paris he attacked relentlessly.    As a reward for his championship he received the title of baron.    In 1878, while only twenty-four, he married the Countess de Saint-Pery,  by whom he had two children, a boy and a girl, and three years later  he started _Triboulet_. It was this paper that made him famous to \"all  Paris.\"    It was a Royalist sheet, subsidized by the Count de Chambord and  published in the interest of the Bourbons. Until 1888 Harden-Hickey was  its editor, and even by his enemies it must be said that he served his  employers with zeal. During the seven years in which the paper amused  Paris and annoyed the republican government, as its editor Harden-Hickey  was involved in forty-two lawsuits, for different editorial  indiscretions, fined three hundred thousand francs, and was a principal  in countless duels.    To his brother editors his standing interrogation was: \"Would you prefer  to meet me upon the editorial page, or in the Bois de Boulogne?\" Among  those who met him in the Bois were Aurelien Scholl, H. Lavenbryon, M.  Taine, M. de Cyon, Philippe Du Bois, Jean Moreas.    In 1888, either because, his patron the Count de Chambord having died,  there was no more money to pay the fines, or because the patience of  the government was exhausted, _Triboulet_ ceased to exist, and  Harden-Hickey, claiming the paper had been suppressed and he himself  exiled, crossed to London.    From there he embarked upon a voyage around the world, which lasted two  years, and in the course of which he discovered the island kingdom of  which he was to be the first and last king. Previous to his departure,  having been divorced from the Countess de Saint-Pery, he placed his boy  and girl in the care of a fellow-journalist and very dear friend, the  Count de la Boissiere, of whom later we shall hear more.    Harden-Hickey started around the world on the _Astoria_, a British  merchant vessel bound for India by way of Cape Horn, Captain Jackson  commanding.    When off the coast of Brazil the ship touched at the uninhabited island  of Trinidad. Historians of James the First say that it was through  stress of weather that the _Astoria_ was driven to seek refuge there,  but as, for six months of the year, to make a landing on the island is  almost impossible, and as at any time, under stress of weather, Trinidad  would be a place to avoid, it is more likely Jackson put in to replenish  his water-casks, or to obtain a supply of turtle meat.    Or it may have been that, having told Harden-Hickey of the derelict  island, the latter persuaded the captain to allow him to land and  explore it. Of this, at least, we are certain, a boat was sent ashore,  Harden-Hickey went ashore in it, and before he left the island, as a  piece of no man's land, belonging to no country, he claimed it in his  own name, and upon the beach raised a flag of his own design.    The island of Trinidad claimed by Harden-Hickey must not be confused  with the larger Trinidad belonging to Great Britain and lying off  Venezuela.    The English Trinidad is a smiling, peaceful spot of great tropical  beauty; it is one of the fairest places in the West Indies. At every  hour of the year the harbor of Port of Spain holds open its arms to  vessels of every draught. A governor in a pith helmet, a cricket club, a  bishop in gaiters, and a botanical garden go to make it a prosperous  and contented colony. But the little derelict Trinidad, in latitude  20 degrees 30 minutes south, and longitude 29 degrees 22 minutes west,  seven hundred miles from the coast of Brazil, is but a spot upon the  ocean. On most maps it is not even a spot. Except by birds, turtles, and  hideous land-crabs, it is uninhabited; and against the advances of man  its shores are fortified with cruel ridges of coral, jagged limestone  rocks, and a tremendous towering surf which, even in a dead calm, beats  many feet high against the coast.    In 1698 Dr. Halley visited the island, and says he found nothing living  but doves and land-crabs. \"Saw many green turtles in sea, but by reason  of the great surf, could catch none.\"    After Halley's visit, in 1700 the island was settled by a few Portuguese  from Brazil. The ruins of their stone huts are still in evidence. But  Amaro Delano, who called in 1803, makes no mention of the Portuguese;  and when, in 1822, Commodore Owen visited Trinidad, he found nothing  living there save cormorants, petrels, gannets, man-of-war birds, and  \"turtles weighing from five hundred to seven hundred pounds.\"    In 1889 E. F. Knight, who in the Japanese-Russian War represented the  London _Morning Post_, visited Trinidad in his yacht in search of buried  treasure.    Alexander Dalrymple, in his book entitled \"Collection of Voages, chiefly  in the Southern Atlantick Ocean, 1775,\" tells how, in 1700, he \"took  possession of the island in his Majesty's name as knowing it to be  granted by the King's letter patent, leaving a Union Jack flying.\"    So it appears that before Harden-Hickey seized the island it already had  been claimed by Great Britain, and later, on account of the Portuguese  settlement, by Brazil. The answer Harden-Hickey made to these claims  was that the English never settled in Trinidad, and that the Portuguese  abandoned it, and, therefore, their claims lapsed. In his \"prospectus\"  of his island, Harden-Hickey himself describes it thus:    \"Trinidad is about five miles long and three miles wide. In spite of  its rugged and uninviting appearance, the inland plateaus are rich with  luxuriant vegetation.    \"Prominent among this is a peculiar species of bean, which is not only  edible, but extremely palatable. The surrounding seas swarm with fish,  which as yet are wholly unsuspicious of the hook. Dolphins, rock-cod,  pigfish, and blackfish may be caught as quickly as they can be hauled  out. I look to the sea birds and the turtles to afford our principal  source of revenue. Trinidad is the breeding-place of almost the"]]]
