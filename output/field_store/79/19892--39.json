Already the effect of the ballot has been shown in            philanthropic, civic and social work in which            women are engaged and the women of this state            realizing that partial suffrage means so much to            them, wish to express their deepest interest in the            outcome of the campaign for full suffrage which            eastern women are waging this year.              So we say to the women in the four campaign states            this year: \"You are working not only toward your            own enfranchisement but toward the enfranchisement            of the women in all the non-suffrage states in the            union. Your victory means victory in other states.            You are our leaders at this crucial time and            thousands of women are looking to you. You have            their deepest and heartiest co-operation in your            campaign work for much depends upon what you do in            working for that victory which we hope will come            to the women of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey            and Massachusetts in this year of 1915.\"                                                  JANE ADDAMS.

When ham is done remove from stove and allow it to become cold in  the water in which it was cooked.    Now remove the ham from water; skin and stick cloves (about 1 1/2 dozen)  over the ham. Rub brown sugar into the ham; put in roasting pan and pour  over sherry and vinegar. Baste continually and allow it to warm through  and brown nicely. This should take about 1/2 hour. Serve with a garnish  of glazed sweet potatoes. Caramel from ham is served in a gravy tureen.  Remove all greases from same.    This is a dish fit for the greatest epicure.

You see, I am out on a long cruise on the Bay of            San Francisco, and up the rivers of California,            and receive my mail only semi-occasionally. Yours            has now come to hand, and I have consulted with            Mrs. London, and we have worked out the following            recipes, which are especial \"tried\" favorites of            mine:      Roast Duck    The only way in the world to serve a canvas-back or a mallard, or a  sprig, or even the toothsome teal, is as follows: The plucked bird  should be stuffed with a tight handful of plain raw celery and, in a  piping oven, roasted variously 8, 9, 10, or even 11 minutes, according  to size of bird and heat of oven. The blood-rare breast is carved with  the leg and the carcass then thoroughly squeezed in a press. The  resultant liquid is seasoned with salt, pepper, lemon and paprika, and  poured hot over the meat. This method of roasting insures the maximum  tenderness and flavor in the bird. The longer the wild duck is roasted,  the dryer and tougher it becomes.    Hoping that you may find the foregoing useful for your collection, and  with best wishes for the success of your book.

Of the following mixture            1/4 teaspoon sage, thyme, and sweet marjoram            2 eggs            1 cup stock. If not procurable use 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk            3/4 cup bread crumbs    Have meat ground fine as possible. Then mix thoroughly with the herbs, 1  egg, pepper and salt, 1/2 cup stock and 1/2 cup crumbs.    Form a loaf and brush top and sides with the second egg. Now, scatter  the remaining 1/4 cup of crumbs over the moistened loaf.    Place in a baking pan with the 1/2 cup of stock and bake in a moderate  oven three hours, basting very frequently, and adding water in case  stock is consumed.      Ducks    Take two young ducks, wash and dry out thoroughly; rub outside with salt  and pepper--lay in roasting pan, breast down. Cut in half one good sized  onion and an apple cut in half (not peeled). Lay around the ducks and  put in about one and one-half pints hot water. Cover with lid of  roasting pan and cook in a medium hot oven.    In an hour turn ducks on back and add a teaspoon of tart jelly. Leave  lid off and baste frequently.    In another hour the ducks are ready to serve. Pour off fat in pan. Make  thickening for gravy (not removing the onion or apple).

On the other  hand, there is not the slightest evidence of any belief in retribution  after death, but the contrary; ritual obligations have at least as  strong sanction as moral; there are clear indications that some of  the most stringent of the Levitical laws were unknown even to Samuel;  priests often appear to be superseded by laymen, even in the performance  of sacrifices and divination; and no line of demarcation can be drawn  between necromancer, wizard, seer, prophet, and priest, each of whom is  regarded, like all the rest, as a medium of communication between the  world of Elohim and that of living men.    The theological system thus defined offers to the anthropologist no  feature which is devoid of a parallel in the known theologies of other  races of mankind, even of those who inhabit parts of the world most  remote from Palestine. And the foundation of the whole, the ghost  theory, is exactly that theological speculation which is the most widely  spread of all, and the most deeply rooted among uncivilised men. I am  able to base this statement, to some extent, on facts within my own  knowledge. In December 1848, H.M.S. _Rattlesnake,_ the ship to which  I then belonged, was anchored off Mount Ernest, an island in Torres  Straits. The people were few and well disposed; and, when a friend of  mine (whom I will call B.) and I went ashore, we made acquaintance  with an old native, Paouda by name. In course of time we became quite  intimate with the old gentleman, partly by the rendering of mutual good  offices, but chiefly because Paouda believed he had discovered that B.  was his father-in-law. And his grounds for this singular conviction were  very remarkable. We had made a long stay at Cape York hard by; and, in  accordance with a theory which is widely spread among the Australians,  that white men are the reincarnated spirits of black men, B. was held to  be the ghost, or _narki,_ of a certain Mount Ernest native, one Antarki,  who had lately died, on the ground of some real or fancied resemblance  to the latter. Now Paouda had taken to wife a daughter of Antarki's,  named Domani, and as soon as B. informed him that he was the ghost of  Antarki, Paouda at once admitted the relationship and acted upon it.  For, as all the women on the island had hidden away in fear of the ship,  and we were anxious to see what they were like, B. pleaded pathetically  with Paouda that it would be very unkind not to let him see his daughter  and grandchildren. After a good deal of hesitation and the exaction of  pledges of deep secrecy, Paouda consented to take B., and myself as B.'s  friend, to see Domani and the three daughters, by whom B. was received  quite as one of the family, while I was courteously welcomed on his  account.    This scene made an impression upon me which is not yet effaced. It left  no question on my mind of the sincerity of the strange ghost theory  of these savages, and of the influence which their belief has on their  practical life. I had it in my mind, as well as many a like result  of subsequent anthropological studies, when, in 1869, [14] I wrote as  follows:--       There are savages without God in any proper sense of the word,     but none without ghosts. And the Fetishism, Ancestor-worship,     Hero-worship, and Demonology of primitive savages are all, I     believe, different manners of expression of their belief in     ghosts, and of the anthropomorphic interpretation of out-of-the-     way events which is its concomitant. Witchcraft and sorcery are     the practical expressions of these beliefs; and they stand in     the same relation to religious worship as the simple     anthropomorphism of children or savages does to theology.    I do not quote myself with any intention of making a claim to  originality in putting forth this view; for I have since discovered that  the same conception is virtually contained in the great \"Discours sur  l'Histoire Universelle\" of Bossuet, now more than two centuries old:  [15]--       Le culte des hommes morta faisoit presque tout le fond de     l'idolatrie; presque tous les hommes sacrificient aux manes,     c'est-a-dire aux ames des morts. De si anciennes erreurs nous     font voir a la verite combien etoit ancienne la croyance de     l'immortalite de l'ame, et nous montrent qu'elle doit etre     rangee parmi les premieres traditions du genre humain.     Mais l'homme, qui gatoit tout, en avoit etrangement abuse,     puisqu'elle le portoit a sacrificer aux morts. On alloit meme     jusqu'a cet exces, de leur sacrifier des hommes vivans; ou tuoit     leurs esclaves, et meme leurs femmes, pour les aller servir dans     l'autre monde.    Among more modern writers J. G. Muller, in his excellent \"Geschichte  der amerikanischen Urreligionen\" (1855), clearly recognises  \"gespensterhafter Geisterglaube\" as the foundation of all savage  and semi-civilised theology, and I need do no more than mention the  important developments of the same view which are to be found in Mr.  Tylor's \"Primitive Culture,\" and in the writings of Mr. Herbert Spencer,  especially his recently-published \"Ecclesiastical Institutions.\" [16]    It is a matter of fact that, whether we direct our attention to  the older conditions of civilised societies, in Japan, in China, in  Hindostan, in Greece, or in Rome, [17] we find, underlying all  other theological notions, the belief in ghosts, with its inevitable  concomitant sorcery; and a primitive cult, in the shape of a worship of  ancestors, which is essentially an attempt to please, or appease their  ghosts. The same thing is true of old Mexico and Peru, and of all the  semi-civilised or savage peoples who have developed a definite cult; and  in those who, like the natives of Australia, have not even a cult, the  belief in, and fear of, ghosts is as strong as anywhere else. The most  clearly demonstrable article of the theology of the Israelites in the  eleventh and twelfth centuries B.C. is therefore simply the article  which is to be found in all primitive theologies, namely, the belief  that a man has a soul which continues to exist after death for a longer  or shorter time, and may return, as a ghost, with a divine, or at least  demonic, character, to influence for good or evil (and usually for  evil) the affairs of the living. But the correspondence between the old  Israelitic and other archaic forms of theology extends to details. If,  in order to avoid all chance of direct communication, we direct  our attention to the theology of semi-civilised people, such as the  Polynesian Islanders, separated by the greatest possible distance,  and by every conceivable physical barrier, from the inhabitants of  Palestine, we shall find not merely that all the features of old  Israelitic theology, which are revealed in the records cited, are found  among them; but that extant information as to the inner mind of these  people tends to remove many of the difficulties which those who have not  studied anthropology find in the Hebrew narrative.    One of the best sources, if not the best source, of information on these  topics is Mariner's _Tonga Islands,_ which tells us of the condition of  Cook's \"Friendly Islanders\" eighty years ago, before European influence  was sensibly felt among them. Mariner, a youth of fair education and of  no inconsiderable natural ability (as the work which was drawn up from  the materials he furnished shows), was about fifteen years of age when  his ship was attacked and plundered by the Tongans: he remained four  years in the islands, familiarised himself with the language, lived the  life of the people, became intimate with many of them, and had every  opportunity of acquainting himself with their opinions, as well as with  their habits and customs. He seems to have been devoid of prejudices,  theological or other, and the impression of strict accuracy which his  statements convey has been justified by all the knowledge of Polynesian  life which has been subsequently acquired.    It is desirable, therefore, to pay close attention to that which Mariner  tells us about the theological views of these people: [18]--       The human soul, after its separation from the body, is     termed a _hotooa_ (a god or spirit), and is believed to     exist in the shape of the body; to have the same propensities as     during life, but to be corrected by a more enlightened     understanding, by which it readily distinguishes good from evil,     truth from falsehood, right from wrong; having the same     attributes as the original gods, but in a minor degree, and     having its dwelling for ever in the happy regions of Bolotoo,     holding the same rank in regard to other souls as during this     life; it has, however, the power of returning to Tonga to     inspire priests, relations, or others, or to appear in dreams to     those it wishes to admonish; and sometimes to the external eye     in the form of a ghost or apparition; but this power of     reappearance at Tonga particularly belongs to the souls of     chiefs rather than of matabooles. (vol. ii. p. 130).    The word \"hotooa\" is the same as that which is usually spelt \"atua\"  by Polynesian philologues, and it will be convenient to adopt this  spelling. Now under this head of \"_Atuas_ or supernatural intelligent  beings\" the Tongans include:--    \"1. The original gods. 2. The souls of nobles that have all attributes  in common with the first but inferior in degree. 3. The souls of  matabooles [19] that are still inferior, and have not the power as the  two first have of coming back to Tonga to inspire the priest, though  they are supposed to have the power of appearing to their relatives.  4. The original attendants or servants, as it were, of the gods, who,  although they had their origin and have ever "]]]
