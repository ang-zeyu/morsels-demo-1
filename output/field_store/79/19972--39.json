Alexander the Great introduced the \"vegetable wool\" into Europe. The  fable of the \"vegetable lamb of Tartary\" persisted almost down to modern  times. The Moors cultivated cotton in Spain on an extensive scale, but  after their expulsion the industry languished. The East India Company  imported cotton fabrics into England early in the seventeenth century,  and these fabrics made their way in spite of the bitter opposition of  the woolen interests, which were at times strong enough to have the use  of cotton cloth prohibited by law. But when the Manchester spinners  took up the manufacture of cotton, the fight was won. The Manchester  spinners, however, used linen for their warp threads, for without  machinery they could not spin threads sufficiently strong from the  short-fibered Indian cotton.    In the New World the Spanish explorers found cotton and cotton fabrics  in use everywhere. Columbus, Cortes, Pizarro, Magellan, and others speak  of the various uses to which the fiber was put, and admired the striped  awnings and the colored mantles made by the natives. It seems probable  that cotton was in use in the New World quite as early as in India.    The first English settlers in America found little or no cotton among  the natives. But they soon began to import the fiber from the West  Indies, whence came also the plant itself into the congenial soil and  climate of the Southern colonies. During the colonial period, however,  cotton never became the leading crop, hardly an important crop. Cotton  could be grown profitably only where there was an abundant supply of  exceedingly cheap labor, and labor in America, white or black, was never  and could never be as cheap as in India. American slaves could be much  more profitably employed in the cultivation of rice and indigo.    Three varieties of the cotton plant were grown in the South. Two kinds  of the black-seed or long-staple variety thrived in the sea-islands and  along the coast from Delaware to Georgia, but only the hardier and more  prolific green-seed or short-staple cotton could be raised inland. The  labor of cultivating and harvesting cotton of any kind was very great.  The fiber, growing in bolls resembling a walnut in size and shape,  had to be taken by hand from every boll, as it has to be today, for no  satisfactory cotton harvester has yet been invented. But in the case  of the green-seed or upland cotton, the only kind which could ever be  cultivated extensively in the South, there was another and more serious  obstacle in the way, namely, the difficulty of separating the fiber  from the seeds. No machine yet devised could perform this tedious and  unprofitable task. For the black-seed or sea-island cotton, the churka,  or roller gin, used in India from time immemorial, drawing the fiber  slowly between a pair of rollers to push out the seeds, did the work  imperfectly, but this churka was entirely useless for the green-seed  variety, the fiber of which clung closely to the seed and would yield  only to human hands. The quickest and most skillful pair of hands could  separate only a pound or two of lint from its three pounds of seeds in  an ordinary working day. Usually the task was taken up at the end of the  day, when the other work was done. The slaves sat round an overseer who  shook the dozing and nudged the slow. It was also the regular task for a  rainy day. It is not surprising, then, that cotton was scarce, that  flax and wool in that day were the usual textiles, that in 1783 wool  furnished about seventy-seven per cent, flax about eighteen per cent,  and cotton only about five per cent of the clothing of the people of  Europe and the United States.    That series of inventions designed for the manufacture of cloth, and  destined to transform Great Britain, the whole world, in fact, was  already completed in Franklin's time. Beginning with the flying shuttle  of John Kay in 1738, followed by the spinning jenny of James Hargreaves  in 1764, the water-frame of Richard Arkwright in 1769, and the mule of  Samuel Crompton ten years later, machines were provided which could spin  any quantity of fiber likely to be offered. And when, in 1787, Edmund  Cartwright, clergyman and poet, invented the self-acting loom to which  power might be applied, the series was complete. These inventions,  supplementing the steam engine of James Watt, made the Industrial  Revolution. They destroyed the system of cottage manufactures in England  and gave birth to the great textile establishments of today.    The mechanism for the production of cloth on a great scale was provided,  if only the raw material could be found.    The romance of cotton begins on a New England farm. It was on a farm in  the town (township) of Westboro, in Worcester County, Massachusetts, in  the year 1765, that Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, was born.  Eli's father was a man of substance and standing in the community,  a mechanic as well as a farmer, who occupied his leisure in making  articles for his neighbors. We are told that young Eli displayed a  passion for tools almost as soon as he could walk, that he made a violin  at the age of twelve and about the same time took his father's watch  to pieces surreptitiously and succeeded in putting it together again so  successfully as to escape detection. He was able to make a table knife  to match the others of a broken set. As a boy of fifteen or sixteen,  during the War of Independence, he was supplying the neighborhood with  hand-made nails and various other articles. Though he had not been a  particularly apt pupil in the schools, he conceived the ambition of  attending college; and so, after teaching several winters in rural  schools, he went to Yale. He appears to have paid his own way through  college by the exercise of his mechanical talents. He is said to have  mended for the college some imported apparatus which otherwise would  have had to go to the old country for repairs. \"There was a good  mechanic spoiled when you came to college,\" he was told by a carpenter  in the town. There was no \"Sheff\" at Yale in those days to give young  men like Whitney scientific instruction; so, defying the bent of his  abilities, Eli went on with his academic studies, graduated in 1792,  at the age of twenty-seven, and decided to be a teacher or perhaps a  lawyer.    Like so many young New Englanders of the time, Whitney sought employment  in the South. Having received the promise of a position in South  Carolina, he embarked at New York, soon after his graduation, on a  sailing vessel bound for Savannah. On board he met the widow of General  Nathanael Greene of Revolutionary fame, and this lady invited him to  visit her plantation at Mulberry Grove, near Savannah. What happened  then is best told by Eli Whitney himself, in a letter to his father,  written at New Haven, after his return from the South some months later,  though the spelling master will probably send Whitney to the foot of the  class:    \"New Haven, Sept. 11th, 1793.    \"... I went from N. York with the family of the late Major General  Greene to Georgia. I went immediately with the family to their  Plantation about twelve miles from Savannah with an expectation of  spending four or five days and then proceed into Carolina to take the  school as I have mentioned in former letters. During this time I  heard much said of the extreme difficulty of ginning Cotton, that is,  separating it from its seeds. There were a number of very respectable  Gentlemen at Mrs. Greene's who all agreed that if a machine could be  invented which would clean the cotton with expedition, it would be a  great thing both to the Country and to the inventor. I involuntarily  happened to be thinking on the subject and struck out a plan of a  Machine in my mind, which I communicated to Miller (who is agent to  the Executors of Genl. Greene and resides in the family, a man of  respectability and property), he was pleased with the Plan and said if  I would pursue it and try an experiment to see if it would answer, he  would be at the whole expense, I should loose nothing but my time, and  if I succeeded we would share the profits. Previous to this I found I  was like to be disappointed in my school, that is, instead of a hundred,  I found I could get only fifty Guineas a year. I however held the  refusal of the school until I tried some experiments. In about ten Days  I made a little model, for which I was offered, if I would give up all  right and title to it, a Hundred Guineas. I concluded to relinquish  my school and turn my attention to perfecting the Machine. I made one  before I came away which required the labor of one man to turn it and  with which one man will clean ten times as much cotton as he can in any  other way before known and also cleanse it much better than in the usual  mode. This machine may be turned by water or with a horse, with the  greatest ease, and one man and a horse will do more than fifty men with  the old machines. It makes the labor fifty times less, without throwing  any class of People out of business.    \"I returned to the Northward for the purpose of having a machine made  on a large scale and obtaining a Patent for the invention. I went to  Philadelphia* soon after I arrived, made myself acquainted with the  steps necessary to obtain a Patent, took several of the steps and the  Secretary of State Mr. Jefferson agreed to send the Patent to me  as soon it could be made out--so that I apprehended no difficulty in  obtaining the Patent--Since I have been here I have employed several  workmen in making machines and as soon as my business is such that I can  leave it a few days, I shall come to Westboro'**. I think it is probable  I shall go to Philadelphia again before I come to Westboro', and when I  do come I shall be able to stay but few days.

It was to a busy life in Bath that HERSCHEL took his sister CAROLINA,  then twenty-two years old. She was a perfectly untried girl, of very  small accomplishments and outwardly with but little to attract. The  basis of her character was the possibility of an unchanging devotion to  one object; for the best years of her life this object was the happiness  and success of her brother WILLIAM, whom she profoundly loved. Her love  was headstrong and full of a kind of obstinate pride, which refused to  see anything but the view she had adopted. As long as her life continued  to be with her dearest brother, all was well with her. She had a noble  aim, and her heart was more than full. Later on, this very singleness of  character brought her other years of wretchedness. It is necessary to  understand the almost spaniel-like allegiance she gave, in order to  comprehend the value which her services were to HERSCHEL. She supplied  him with an aid which was utterly loyal, entire, and devoted. Her  obedience was unquestioning, her reverence amounted almost to adoration.  In their relation, he gave everything in the way of incentive and  initiative, and she returned her entire effort loyally.    At first her business was to gain a knowledge of the language, and to  perfect herself in singing, so that she might become a soloist in the  concerts and oratorios which he was constantly giving.    In the beginning it was not easy.        . . . \"As the season for the arrival of visitors to the baths does      not begin till October, my brother had leisure to try my capacity for      becoming a useful singer for his concerts and oratorios, and being      very well satisfied with my voice, I had two or three lessons every      day, and the hours which were not spent at the harpsichord, were      employed in putting me in the way of managing the family. . . .      On the second morning, on meeting my brother at breakfast, he began      immediately to give me a lesson in English and arithmetic, and      showed me the way of booking and keeping accounts of cash received      and laid out. . . . By way of relaxation we talked of astronomy and      the bright constellations with which I had made acquaintance during      the fine nights we spent on the postwagen travelling through Holland.        \"My brother ALEXANDER, who had been some time in England, boarded      and lodged with his elder brother, and, with myself, occupied the      attic. The first floor, which was furnished in the newest and most      handsome style, my brother kept for himself. The front room,      containing the harpsichord, was always in order to receive his      musical friends and scholars at little private concerts or      rehearsals. . . . Sundays I received a sum for the weekly expenses,      of which my housekeeping book (written in English) showed the amount      laid out, and my purse the remaining cash. One of the principal      things required was to market, and about six weeks after coming to      England I was sent alone among fishwomen, butchers, basket-women,      etc., and I brought home whatever in my fright I could pick up. . . .      My brother ALEX., who was now returned from his summer engagement,      used to watch me at a distance, unknown to me, till he saw me safe      on my way home. But all attempts to introduce any order in our      little household proved vain, owing to the servant my brother then      had. And what still further increased my difficulty was, that my      brother's time was entirely taken up with business, so that I only      saw him at meals. Breakfast was at seven o'clock or before--much too      early for me, who would rather have remained up all night than be      obliged to rise at so early an hour. . . .        \"The three winter months passed on very heavily. I had to struggle      against _heimwehe_ (home sickness) and low spirits, and to answer my      sister's melancholy letters on the death of her husband, by which      she became a widow with six children. I knew too little English to      derive any consolation from the society of those who were about me,      so that, dinner-time excepted, I was entirely left to myself.\"    So the winter passed.        \"The time when I could hope to receive a little more of my brother's      instruction and attention was now drawing near; for after Easter,      Bath becomes very empty, only a few of his scholars, whose families      were resident in the neighborhood, remaining. But I was greatly      disappointed; for, in consequence of the harassing and fatiguing      life he had led during the winter months, he used to retire to bed      with a basin of milk or glass of water, and SMITH'S _Harmonics_ and      _Optics_, FERGUSON'S _Astronomy_, etc., and so went to sleep buried      under his favorite authors; and his first thoughts on rising were      how to obtain instruments for viewing those objects himself of which      he had been reading. There being in one of the shops a      two-and-a-half-foot Gregorian telescope to be let, it was for some      time taken in requisition, and served not only for viewing the      heavens, but for making experiments on its construction. . . . It soon      appeared that my brother was not contented with knowing what former      observers had seen, for he began to contrive a telescope eighteen or      twenty feet long (I believe after HUYGHENS' description). . . . I was      much hindered in my musical practice by my help being continually      wanted in the execution of the various contrivances, and I had to      amuse myself with making the tube of pasteboard for the glasses,      which were to arrive from London, for at that time no optician had      settled at Bath. But when all was finished, no one besides my      brother could get a glimpse of Jupiter or Saturn, for the great      length of the tube would not allow it to be kept in a straight line.      This difficulty, however, was soon removed by substituting tin      tubes. . . . My brother wrote to inquire the price of a reflecting      mirror for (I believe) a five or six foot telescope. The answer was,      there were none of so large a size, but a person offered to make one      at a price much above what my brother thought proper to give. . . .      About this time he bought of a Quaker, resident at Bath, who had      formerly made attempts at polishing mirrors, all his rubbish of      patterns, tools, hones, polishers, unfinished mirrors, etc., but all      for small Gregorians, and none above two or three inches diameter.        \"But nothing serious could be attempted, for want of time, till the      beginning of June, when some of my brother's scholars were leaving      Bath; and then, to my sorrow, I saw almost every room turned into a      workshop. A cabinet-maker making a tube and stands of all      descriptions in a handsomely furnished drawing-room; ALEX. putting      up a huge turning machine (which he had brought in the autumn from      Bristol, where he used to spend the summer) in a bedroom, for      turning patterns, grinding glasses, and turning eye-pieces, etc. At      the same time music durst not lie entirely dormant during the      summer, and my brother had frequent rehearsals at home, where Miss      FARINELLI, an Italian singer, was met by several of the principal      performers he had engaged for the winter concerts.\"    Finally, in 1774, he had made himself a Gregorian telescope,[10] and  had begun to view the heavens. He was then thirty-six years old.    The writer in the _European Magazine_ describes this period:        \"All this time he continued his astronomical observations, and      nothing now seemed wanting to complete his felicity, but sufficient      leisure to enjoy his telescopes, to which he was so much attached,      that at the theatre he used frequently to run from the harpsichord      to look at the stars, during the time between the acts.\"    In an extract from his _Journal No. 1_, now at the rooms of the Royal  Society, may be seen a copy of his first observation of the Nebula of  _Orion_, on March 4, 1774. This was made with his five-and-a-half-foot  Gregorian reflector.    It was at this time (1775), between the acts of the theatre, that he  made his first review of the heavens, with a Newtonian telescope, of an  aperture of four and a half inches and a magnifying power of 222 times.  This telescope was one of the first made by himself. The review  consisted of the examination of every "]]]
