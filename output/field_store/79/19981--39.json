They  also accompany the exercises on the line with songs.    Little by little the music is _understood_ by the children. They  finish, as in Miss George's school at Washington, by singing over  their daily work with the didactic material. The \"Children's House,\"  then, resembles a hive of bees humming as they work.    As to the little gymnasium, of which I speak in my book on the  \"Method,\" one piece of apparatus is particularly practical. This is  the \"fence,\" from which the children hang by their arms, freeing their  legs from the heavy weight of the body and strengthening the arms.  This fence has also the advantage of being useful in a garden for the  purpose of dividing one part from another, as, for example, the  flower-beds from the garden walks, and it does not detract in any way  from the appearance of the garden.          SENSORY EDUCATION      [Illustration: FIG. 5.--CYLINDERS DECREASING IN DIAMETER ONLY.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--CYLINDERS DECREASING IN DIAMETER AND HEIGHT.]    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--CYLINDERS DECREASING IN HEIGHT ONLY.]    My didactic material offers to the child the _means_ for what may be  called \"sensory education.\"    In the box of material the first three objects which are likely to  attract the attention of a little child from two and a half to three  years old are three solid pieces of wood, in each of which is inserted  a row of ten small cylinders, or sometimes discs, all furnished with a  button for a handle. In the first case there is a row of cylinders of  the same height, but with a diameter which decreases from thick to  thin. (Fig. 5.) In the second there are cylinders which decrease in  all dimensions, and so are either larger or smaller, but always of the  same shape. (Fig. 6.)    Lastly, in the third case, the cylinders have the same diameter but  vary in height, so that, as the size decreases, the cylinder gradually  becomes a little disc in form. (Fig. 7.)    The first cylinders vary in two dimensions (the section); the second  in all three dimensions; the third in one dimension (height). The  order which I have given refers to the degree of _ease_ with which the  child performs the exercises.    The exercise consists in taking out the cylinders, mixing them and  putting them back in the right place. It is performed by the child as  he sits in a comfortable position at a little table. He exercises his  hands in the delicate act of taking hold of the button with the tips  of one or two fingers, and in the little movements of the hand and arm  as he mixes the cylinders, _without letting them fall_ and _without  making too much noise_ and puts them back again each in its own  place.    In these exercises the teacher may, in the first instance, intervene,  merely taking out the cylinders, mixing them carefully on the table  and then showing the child that he is to put them back, but without  performing the action herself. Such intervention, however, is almost  always found to be unnecessary, for the children _see_ their  companions at work, and thus are encouraged to imitate them.    They like to do it _alone_; in fact, sometimes almost in private for  fear of inopportune help. (Fig. 8.)    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--CHILD USING CASE OF CYLINDERS.]    But how is the child to find the right place for each of the little  cylinders which lie mixed upon the table? He first makes trials; it  often happens that he places a cylinder which is too large for the  empty hole over which he puts it. Then, changing its place, he tries  others until the cylinder goes in. Again, the contrary may happen;  that is to say, the cylinder may slip too easily into a hole too big  for it. In that case it has taken a place which does not belong to it  at all, but to a larger cylinder. In this way one cylinder at the end  will be left out without a place, and it will not be possible to find  one that fits. Here the child cannot help seeing his mistake in  concrete form. He is perplexed, his little mind is faced with a  problem which interests him intensely. Before, all the cylinders  fitted, now there is one that will not fit. The little one stops,  frowning, deep in thought. He begins to feel the little buttons and  finds that some cylinders have too much room. He thinks that perhaps  they are out of their right place and tries to place them correctly.  He repeats the process again and again, and finally he succeeds. Then  it is that he breaks into a smile of triumph. The exercise arouses the  intelligence of the child; he wants to repeat it right from the  beginning and, having learned by experience, he makes another attempt.  Little children from three to three and a half years old have repeated  the exercise up to _forty_ times without losing their interest in it.    If the second set of cylinders and then the third are presented, the  _change_ of shape strikes the child and reawakens his interest.    The material which I have described serves to _educate the eye_ to  distinguish _difference in dimension_, for the child ends by being  able to recognize at a glance the larger or the smaller hole which  exactly fits the cylinder which he holds in his hand. The educative  process is based on this: that the control of the error lies in _the  material itself_, and the child has concrete evidence of it.    The desire of the child to attain an end which he knows, leads him to  correct himself. It is not a teacher who makes him notice his mistake  and shows him how to correct it, but it is a complex work of the  child's own intelligence which leads to such a result.    Hence at this point there begins the process of auto-education.    The aim is not an external one, that is to say, it is _not_ the object  that the child should learn how to place the cylinders, and _that he  should know how to perform an exercise_.    The aim is an inner one, namely, that the child train himself to  observe; that he be led to make comparisons between objects, to form  judgments, to reason and to decide; and it is in the indefinite  repetition of this exercise of attention and of intelligence that a  real development ensues.                      *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE TOWER.]    The series of objects to follow after the cylinders consists of three  sets of geometrical solid forms:    (1) Ten wooden cubes colored pink. The sides of the cubes diminish  from ten centimeters to one centimeter. (Fig. 9.)    With these cubes the child builds a tower, first laying on the ground  (upon a carpet) the largest cube, and then placing on the top of it  all the others in their order of size to the very smallest. (Fig. 10.)  As soon as he has built the tower, the child, with a blow of his hand,  knocks it down, so that the cubes are scattered on the carpet, and  then he builds it up again.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--CHILD PLAYING WITH TOWER. (PHOTO TAKEN AT MR.  HAWKER'S SCHOOL AT RUNTON.)]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--THE BROAD STAIR.]    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--THE LONG STAIR.]    (2) Ten wooden prisms, colored brown. The length of the prisms is  twenty centimeters, and the square section diminishes from ten  centimeters a side to the smallest, one centimeter a side. (Fig. 11.)    The child scatters the ten pieces over a light-colored carpet, and  then beginning sometimes with the thickest, sometimes with the  thinnest, he places them in their right order of gradation upon a  table.    (3) Ten rods, colored green, or alternately red and blue, all of which  have the same square section of four centimeters a side, but vary by  ten centimeters in length from ten centimeters to one meter. (Fig.  12.)    The child scatters the ten rods on a large carpet and mixes them at  random, and, by comparing rod with rod, he arranges them according to  their order of length, so that they take the form of a set of organ  pipes.    As usual, the teacher, by doing the exercises herself, first shows the  child how the pieces of each set should be arranged, but it will often  happen that the child learns, not directly from her, but by watching  his companions. She will, however, always continue to watch the  children, never losing sight of their efforts, and any correction of  hers will be directed more towards preventing rough or disorderly use  of the material than towards any _error_ which the child may make in  placing the rods in their order of gradation. The reason is that the  mistakes which the child makes, by placing, for example, a small cube  beneath one that is larger, are caused by his own lack of education,  and it is the _repetition of the exercise_ which, by refining his  powers of observation, will lead him sooner or later to _correct_  _himself_. Sometimes it happens that a child working with the long  rods makes the most glaring mistakes. As the aim of the exercise,  however, is _not_ that the rods be arranged in the right order of  gradation, but that the child _should practise by himself_, there is  no need to intervene.    One day the child will arrange all the rods in their right order, and  then, full of joy, he will call the teacher to come and admire them.  The object of the exercise will thus be achieved.    These three sets, the cubes, the prisms, and the rods, cause the child  to move about and to handle and carry objects which are difficult for  him to grasp with his little hand. Again, by their use, he repeats the  _training of the eye_ to the recognition of differences of size  between similar objects. The exercise would seem easier, from the  sensory point of view, than the other with the cylinders described  above.    As a matter of fact, it is more difficult, as there is _no control of  the error in the material itself_. It is the child's eye alone which  can furnish the control.    Hence the difference between the objects should strike the eye at  once; for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29688"],[0,"Home Range and Movements of the Eastern Cottontail in Kansas (#5)"],[1,"or  propagation of cottontail populations is desired. Cottontails establish  a home range where they are born and enlarge it to nearly full size the  first winter. Home ranges of cottontails are overlapped by those of  others regardless of sex or age. No territory is maintained.    The cottontail makes movements to forage, to seek cover from predators  and the weather, to reproduce, build nests, care for young, keep pace  with changes in vegetation through the year, and escape unusually  severe climatic conditions. Movements may be caused by desire for  acquaintance with surroundings and other animals, escape from  undesirable surroundings or animals, or merely release of nervous  energy.    When foraging, cottontails moved 175 to 325 feet per day, mostly near  woodland edges, and used from 10 to 20 per cent of the home range. When  escaping from predators cottontails moved 30 to 1200 feet and used 5 to  70 per cent of their home ranges, depending on the type of pursuit.  Some cottontails that were followed, ran in almost circular courses for  as far as 3000 feet and covered as much as 90 per cent of their home  ranges. Paths or runways were not used except in deep snow or very  dense vegetation. Movements were limited by deep snow. When  temperatures were unfavorably high or low, cottontails sought cover  deep in the woods or under rock outcrops, and in dry stream beds. In  moderate weather resting places in grass forms, brush piles and  thickets were used.    Both males and females moved farther in the breeding season than in the  rest of the year, but females that were caring for young in summer and  late spring moved shorter distances than they did when not so engaged  in autumn and winter.    Cottontails were most active at dawn and especially, dusk, and were  more active on dark nights than on moonlight nights. Cottontails were  most active when the air temperature was between 0 deg. F. and 33 deg. F. and  when rain was not falling. Activity increased as the percentage of  ground covered by snow increased and as the abundance of food  decreased. Activity did not vary with physiological condition except  that as body weight decreased activity increased--probably because of  lack of food.    The home range is used most intensively near centers of activity that  are near woodland edges or in other areas of good cover. Cottontails  often ranged through the woods and along edges but did not cross open  areas more than 75 feet wide. Cottontails use their home range most  intensively in winter when they are forced to move long distances in  poor cover, searching for food. More than one cottontail may use sites  of good cover at the same time and two or three used the same resting  place at different times.    Two instances of homing were observed; cottontails moved 1,100 and  1,800 feet to return to their home ranges, but one cottontail that  escaped 1700 feet from home failed to return.    The average home range of 18 cottontails for whom adequate data were  gathered was 8.34 acres. The home ranges of males averaged 1.16 acre  larger than those of females. In summer, cottontails increased their  home ranges 5 to 15 per cent by taking advantage of cover provided by  the more abundant vegetation. Cottontails three weeks to five months of  age lived in home ranges of between 0.1 and 4.0 acres and enlarged  their home ranges almost to their ultimate full size in the first  winter.
