This lack of flavor seriously impairs their value in       nutriment. A little Armour's Extract of Beef will in every       case provide that touch of flavor which appeals to the       palate and finds ready response from the digestive juices of       the stomach. This extract is very highly concentrated, so       that only a little is required.      RICE SOUP    Dissolve one teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef in one quart of water,  add one half cup of cooked rice, and a tablespoon of onion juice. Add  one teaspoon of celery seed and cover closely. Simmer ten minutes and  just before serving add one fourth cup of sweet cream or a tablespoon of  butter. If too thick, add a little boiling water or milk.---MRS. W. V.  COPELAND, 227 N. LAKE STREET, TOPEKA, KANS.      SPINACH AND SAUCE    After spinach has boiled for twenty minutes in salt water, drain it and  serve with this sauce: Dissolve one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract of  Beef in a cup of hot water, add two tablespoons of butter, break in two  eggs and use half teaspoon of lemon juice. Stir constantly and cook for  a few minutes.--MRS. W. I. COLE, PUNTA GORDA, FLA.      TOMATO ASPIC JELLY    One fourth teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef, one can of Veribest  Tomato Soup, one half package of gelatine, three hard-boiled eggs, and  chopped olives. Heat the soup with an equal amount of water. Soak the  gelatine in half cup of cold water and dissolve in the soup. Add Extract  of Beef dissolved in a little water. Let cool. Add chopped hard boiled  eggs and olives. If there is cold chicken at hand, a half cup of chicken  chopped will improve the jelly. Pour into mold and put on ice. Serve  with mayonnaise on lettuce leaves.--MRS. R. M. BRUMBY, ANONA, FLA.      STUFFED TOMATOES    Remove seeds and centers from six tomatoes. Chop three green peppers and  one onion and fry in butter until the onions begin to brown. Add a small  lump of butter, some chopped nuts and dried bread crumbs, salt and  pepper to season, and one third cup of hot water in which one half  teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef has been dissolved. Put the  tomatoes in baking pan and fill with this mixture. Sprinkle crumbs over  tops and bake fifteen minutes.--MRS. L. C. STUMP, 444 N. DENVER AVE.,  KANSAS CITY, MO.      BREAD OMELET    Cut one cup of stale bread into tiny bits, beat the yolks of two eggs,  add a pint of milk and the crumbs. Season with a pinch of salt and  pepper and one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef. Let stand ten  minutes, and then saute in Armour's Simon Pure Leaf Lard until a nice  brown. Add the whites whipped just a moment before taking from the  fire.--ELLA R. STAHL, ROUNDUP, MONT.      FRIED ONIONS    Into a small amount of hot butter slice six good-sized green onions,  tops and all. Cook until wilted, add a little water and boil until it  has evaporated. Scramble in a spoonful of Armour's Beef Extract, three  eggs, pepper and salt to taste. Cook until creamy and serve hot.--MRS.  OLLIE H. THOMAS, MANSFIELD, ARK.      MUSHROOM SAUCE    Use the liquor from one can of mushrooms and enough water to make one  cupful. Chop the mushrooms, add one teaspoon of Armour's Extract of  Beef, and slightly thicken with flour blended with water. Cook six  minutes and serve with broiled steak.--GRACE M. SEARS.      PEA SOUP    One can of peas, one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef, two  tablespoons of butter, one tablespoon of flour, one teaspoon of salt and  a dash of pepper, one half teaspoon of sugar, one quart of milk or half  milk and half cream. Rinse the peas, add some water and boil until soft,  then rub through a colander. Add Armour's Extract of Beef to hot water  and peas, making one quart in all. Melt the butter and add the flour,  then gradually the hot soup. Cook until smooth, add the seasoning, and  the milk and cream last.--KATHERINE SORLIE, BUXTON, N. DAK.      CORN SOUP    Cook in two tablespoons of butter one onion and one sprig of parsley  (cut fine) for five minutes. Add one cup of chopped corn and a cup of  hot water in which has been dissolved one half teaspoon of Armour's  Extract of Beef. Cook fifteen minutes. Add salt, pepper, one cup of  milk, and bind with two tablespoons of flour and butter blended. Serve  with toasted croutons.--MISS AMANDA STEVENS, SOUTH LEE, N. H.      JELLIED BOUILLON SALAD    Make a clear bouillon, using one teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef to  one pint of hot water. Dissolve one spoon of powdered gelatine and stir  into the hot liquid. Stir in a few button mushrooms sliced, or some cold  veal. Add the pulp of one orange, having it peeled, sliced and torn in  sections. When cool turn into cups or molds moistened with cold water.  Stir and divide the material about equal in each cup. Set on ice to  harden. Slice firm tomatoes and lay one each on lettuce leaf. Turn the  bouillon molds onto these and place a large spoon of dressing over  each.--MRS. SADETTE HARRINGTON, ELKHORN, WIS.      EGG SANDWICHES    Mash six hard-boiled eggs very fine, adding pepper, salt and a small  lump of butter. Mix with one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef  dissolved in a tablespoon of hot water, and one third cup of mayonnaise  dressing. Add one cup of finely chopped pecans or peanuts. Mix well and  serve between fresh crackers and thin slices of bread.--NELLIE TONEY,  215 WEST CHURCH ST., GREENWOOD, MISS.      POTATO PUFFS    Bake four large potatoes and put them through potato ricer. Season with  butter, salt and white pepper and add one half teaspoon of Armour's  Extract of Beef. Beat into this the stiffly beaten white of one egg.  Mold this well and roll out on molding board. Cut into cakes and place  on buttered sheet. Bake in hot oven until a golden brown. Serve on  platter with meat, garnished with cress or parsley. MISS S. MAY KIMBALL,  7 TAHANTO ST., CONCORD, N. H.      WILTED LETTUCE SALAD    Wash two heads of lettuce and lay them on ice until wanted, then cut in  small bits and lay in salad dish, adding salt. Heat two tablespoons of  olive oil and pour over the lettuce. To one half cup of white wine  vinegar add one teaspoon of sugar, one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract  of Beef, one tablespoon of mayonnaise dressing. Pour over the lettuce  and garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs.--LOUISE MALLOY, 464 BAYOU  ST., BATESVILLE, ARK.      _Armour's Star Ham--for half a century the best_          Home Dressmaking    [Illustration]      This is an age of good ready made clothes and it is also an age of  clever amateur dressmaking. With excellent patterns which may be easily  handled there is no reason why the woman who can sew should not make her  own clothes, and have smart clothes at a reasonable price--that is,  provided she has the time to give to sewing.    Before starting a dress--even before buying--make a tour of the shops  and see for yourself what is being worn with a keen eye for the little  details which lift a gown from the home made to the professional class.  If you live far from town and can not go to the shops look through the  magazines which make a feature of dress and study what is best suited to  your particular style and requirements. Study materials and buy  economically, which means paying a little more if necessary rather than  have shoddy goods.    Good patterns are essential and these usually have full directions as to  the manner of using. It is a very good plan to have a pattern drafted to  your own measure but if you have not this take some finished garment  which is satisfactory (unless there is someone at hand to take the  measures that a person cannot very well take for herself) and measure  the lengths in different places such as front, back and under lengths on  a blouse and the width across both back and front where it is broadest.  Write these down and proceed to take the same measures on the pattern to  be used. In taking measures be sure to take a correct position or it  will be impossible to get correct measures and you cannot hope for  success if this--the initial step--is taken wrongly. For instance, stand  erect with the chest raised and the abdomen held in and you will find in  taking the width measures across to where the arms and body join the  armhole will be straight and even looking instead of pointing in and out  in places.    Make sure of your measures before starting to apply your pattern to the  cloth. A careful study of this will save many irreparable mistakes  later.          Halloween      The date of this oldtime celebration is always October 31st, the crucial  moment 12 o'clock. To be sure, the original observance of All Hallows  Eve has been considerably distorted during the course of years but the  fun it affords the young folks in its present manner of keeping cannot  be gainsaid and needs no changing. Halloween is the night when a magic  spell enthrals the earth. Witches, bogies, brownies and elves are all  abroad to use their power. Superstition proves true, witchery is  recognized and the future may be read in a hundred and one ways.    No occasion gives more opportunity of enjoyment and no party is gayer  than a Halloween party.    It is not necessary to spend a great deal of money in giving a Halloween  party. With a little time, some suitable paper and a pair of sharp  scissors the witches, pumpkin faces, cats and bats, which are the  distinctive features of this decoration, may be easily made at home.  Yellow, red and black are the colors and the most fascinating crepe  paper can be had for a few cents. This is the best material to use, as  it lends itself so well to all sorts of schemes.    Not only is it made in plain colors which may be decorated at will but  for every festival and occasion there are special designs which make the  work of decoration very easy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26014"],[0,"Practical Taxidermy (#5)"],[1," of having the finest  and most extensive collection in the world, while in reptiles and fish  we were again beaten by Paris. In proof of the growing interest taken  in natural history, we find that in 1860 the number of visitors to the  natural history department was greatly in excess of all the other  departments; and at the present time the attendance has greatly  increased, as also the objects exhibited, a fact patent to all who  will take the trouble to visit the British Museum, or to inspect the  official catalogues published from time to time, a synopsis of which  cannot at present be given owing to their extent and variety; but we  can assume, I think, that we have as complete a natural history  collection as is to be found in any of the museums of the world.  [Footnote: Some idea of the extent of the National Natural History  Collections may be gathered from the pages of the recently-published  British Museum \"Catalogues\" 1874-82, where, in many instances, the  number of specimens of a certain order of birds contained in the  Museum falls very little short of the ascertained number of species  for the whole of the world.]    Though taxidermy flourished, as we see, for some years previous to the  Great Exhibition of 1851, yet that decidedly gave a considerable  impetus to the more correct and artistic delineation of animals,  especially in what may be called the grotesque school instituted by  the Germans, which, though it may perhaps be decried on the score of  misrepresenting nature in the most natural way possible, yet teaches a  special lesson by the increased care necessary to more perfectly  render the fine points required in giving animals that serio-comic and  half-human expression which was so intensely ridiculous and yet  admirable in the studies of the groups illustrating the fable of  \"Reinecke the Fox,\" which were in the Wurtemburgh Court, class XXX.  and were executed by H. Ploucquet, of Stuttgart. These groups, or  similar ones, are now to be seen in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.    In nearly all of these groups the modelling and the varied expressions  of hope, fear, love, and rage, were an immense step in advance of the  old wooden school of taxidermy; specimens of which are still to be  found in museums--stiff, gaunt, erect, and angular. Copies of those  early outrages on nature may still be seen in the dreary plates of the  anything but \"animated\" work of \"poor Goldie,\" who, as Boswell said,  \"loved to shine\" in what was least understood.    16 PRACTICAL TAXIDERMY.    From this era the English artists, having had their eyes opened by the  teachings of the foreign exhibits of 1851, steadily gained ground, and  the Wards having the sense to employ, in the first instance, foreign  artistic workmen, rapidly pushed to the front, until the finest animal  study of ancient or modern times was achieved by one of them--the  \"Lion and Tiger Struggle,\" exhibited at Paris, and afterwards at the  Sydenham Crystal Palace. This, and one or two analogous works, carried  the English to the foremost ranks of zoological artists; and now that  we embellish our taxidermic studies with natural grasses, ferns, etc.  and with representations of scenery and rockwork, in the endeavour to  carry the eye and mind to the actual localities in which the various  species of animals are found--an advance in art not dreamed of fifty  years ago--and also correctly model the heads and limbs of animals, we  still hold our own, and are as far advanced in taxidermy as any other  nation.    CHAPTER II.    DECOYING AND TRAPPING ANIMALS.    THE decoying and trapping of birds, etc, is a somewhat delicate subject  to handle, lest we degenerate into giving instruction in amateur  poaching; but the application of my direction I must leave to the  reader's own sense of fitness of time and scene, and object to be  snared. And now, before launching into my subject, one word in season.  Observe as a golden rule--never to be broken--this: Do not snare,  shoot, nor kill any more birds or animals than you absolutely want--in  fine, do not kill for killing's sake, or snare in wantonness. Let all  you do have reference to some object to be attained, either to procure  specimens wanted for a collection, or, in cases of necessity, for  food. Bear this in mind, for, without sympathy with creatures  fashioned in as complex and beautiful a manner as ourselves, we can  never hope to be true naturalists, or to feel a thrill of exquisite  pleasure run through us when a new specimen falls to our prowess. How  can we admire its beauty when alive, or feel a mournful satisfaction  at its death, if we are constantly killing the same species of bird  for sport alone?    Another thing: kill a wounded bird as quickly and humanely as  possible, which you may always do by pressing its breast just under  the wings with your finger and thumb, bearing the whole weight of the  palm of the hand on the sternum or breast-bone, and gradually  increasing the pressure until life is extinct. This plan suffices for  even the larger birds, provided you can find a means of holding them  firmly while you employ both hands in the manner previously indicated.    Again: if collecting eggs, be content with half the sitting of a nest,  and if you know of a very rare nest of eggs, do not take them all in  your acquisitive greed. If you see a rare bird, on common land, you  may as well secure him as let \"Jack Smith\" make him up in a sparrow  pie; but if the bird is on preserved land, or in a retired spot where  no one is likely to harry it, do think a minute before pulling  trigger, and ask yourself three questions:    1. Will this bird be likely to stay if unmolested?    2. Is it likely to have a mate?    3. Will it nest here?    If you can answer any of these questions in the affirmative, why,  \"don't shoot, colonel;\" for think of the aid to science, and your own  satisfaction, if you can discover anything new in its habits, or  verify any doubtful point. Many rare birds would nest here if  undisturbed, and come again with additions. The Hoopoe, or golden  oriole, for instance, and many other rare birds, would nest, and,  indeed, do nest here when allowed.    An interesting account of the appearance of the great bustard in  Norfolk, and the pains taken through the kindness of Lord Lilford to  provide it with a mate, appeared in the Field of April 8, 1876. But  alas! everyone is not so considerate, and we have but a select few of  such self-sacrificing people.    I presume no notice is required how to set the first trap on our list  --I mean our boyhood's old favourite, the brick trap, or the sieve and  string, both very well in their way in hard weather; but a notice may  be required as to the uses to which the next simplest trap, or springe  (the horsehair noose), may be applied. For the very few people who do  not know how to set it, I will, in the manner of Col. Hawker, who did  everything at the time which he wished to explain in writing, proceed  to make one.    Fig. 1--Loop in wire.    Here, then, I have a black horsehair about two feet long; I double it,  holding it between the right-hand finger and thumb, leaving a little  loose loop of about half an inch long; from this point I proceed by an  overhand motion of the thumb to twist it up; on reaching the bottom I  make a small knot to prevent its unrolling; then, pushing the knotted  end through the eye of the loop, I thus form a loose noose. I then  attach a piece of wire to the free end by a twisted loop (see Fig. 1).    With about half a dozen of these springes coiled in an oval tin box I  am ready to snare any small bird whose haunt I may discover. Birds  which are nesting can easily be caught by placing one noose in the  nest and others round the edge or mouth, making fast the end wires to  any contiguous branch or twigs. Moorhens or water-rails, which swim or  run through the constantly frequented tracks which they have made in  dense undergrowth or rushes in bogs, may be captured by attaching  these nooses to a string stretched across--indeed, a writer in the  Field, of July 8, 1876, says, speaking of Turkestan:    \"Ducks are caught by rather a clever arrangement with horsehair nooses  attached to a string, which is stretched over the ditches and canals  used for irrigation, and so close to the water that the ducks are  compelled when swimming under the string to stretch out their necks,  when they are easily caught in the hanging nooses.\"    Also a useful plan for catching plovers or snipes, which haunt the  edges of streams having a narrow margin between the bank and the  water, is described by him as used for catching quails:    \"One method is simplicity itself: a hair noose is fastened to a lump  of clay well worked together; a number of these appliances are  scattered about the lucerne fields, which the quails are fond of  frequenting; the bird caught in the noose is prevented from flying  away owing to the weight of the lump of clay and its getting easily  entangled in the grass.\"    Wheatears and ortolans are caught by suspending a hair noose between  two turves placed on end and touching each other in the form of the  roof of a house; to this shelter the birds constantly run on the  approach of danger, or even, apparently, through timidity, on the  gathering of storm clouds.    With this springe, also, thrushes and similar birds are described as  being snared by Mr. Gould (in his \"Birds of Great Britain\"), who,  giving Mr. Box as his authority, says:    The thrush is a great source of amusement to the middle, and of  profit to the lower, classes during its autumnal migration. Many  families of Liege, Luxemburg, Luneburg, Namur, parts of Hainault, and  Brabant choose this season for their period of relaxation from  business, and devote themselves to the taking of this bird with  horsehair springes.
