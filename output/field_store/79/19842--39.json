A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#5)"],[1,"bold robbery suggested to a number  of idle men the idea of robbing the freight cars as they remained  apparently unguarded on the tracks in the vicinity of the West Thirtieth  street station, and led to the formation of the notorious Tenth Avenue  gang. The cars arriving from the west and other points loaded with  valuable goods and merchandise, offered facilities of a most tempting  kind to the members of this gang, and large quantities nightly  disappeared until, week after week, the goods stolen aggregated  thousands of dollars loss to the railroad company. The proximity of the  river aided the operations of this gang very materially, for much of the  goods were spirited away with the assistance of the river thieves and  their boats, both sets of thieves acting, of course, in collusion.    It is a very difficult thing to map out just the precise localities  where criminals reside now, owing, in a great measure, to the efficiency  of the present police, who keep evil-doers under constant surveillance,  preventing them remaining long in any one place. Of course, such streets  as are contained in wards of the city where the poorest people dwell  will invariably have their quota of questionable characters; but the  days when gangs of roughs, \"toughs\" or thieves can flourish in one  particular section, it is to be hoped, are matters of the past.    It is a matter of surprise to other nations, and of congratulation to  ourselves, that at the present such crimes against persons and property  as burglary, pocket-picking and highway robbery are much rarer in  proportion than in any other cosmopolitan city in the world.        CHAPTER III.    STREET ARABS OF BOTH SEXES.    _The Pretty Flower and News Girls--The Young Wharf Rats and their  Eventful Lives--How they all Live, where they Come From, and where they  finally Finish their Career._    To the wealthy resident of Fifth avenue and other noted fashionable  thoroughfares, the incidents of actual every-day life that are here  revealed will read like a revelation. To the merchant and the business  man they may probably read like romance. To the thrifty mechanic,  however, who occupies a vastly different social sphere, who hurries to  his work in the morning, and with equal haste seeks to reach his home at  night, this chapter may, perhaps, cause a tear to glisten in his manly  eye when the facts, here written for the first time, meet his gaze, and,  may be, are associated with some young male or female relation or friend  who has \"gone wrong.\" But to the officers of the Society for the  Suppression of Vice, and other kindred useful societies, newspaper men,  the police, and others whose daily vocations happen to keep them out  late o' nights, the truths here unfolded are of too frequent occurrence  and are too familiar sights to need any other corroborative evidence  than is supplied by their own experience and the exercise of their own  observation.    Youthful vice and depravity, of all grades, is, unfortunately, the  natural result of that civilization which finds its outgrowth in large  and necessarily closely-packed communities. Where ground is dear, poor  people must seek rooms in dwellings where the rent is cheap, and these  dwellings are, for the most part, erected in cheap neighborhoods--and  cheap neighborhoods mean questionable companionships and associations,  and bad associations beget a familiarity with immorality of all kinds.  No one can question the truth of this. For instance, the honest and  industrious mechanic, receiving fair wages for his work, must hire  lodgings or rooms in some tenement; he goes to work during the day,  leaving his wife, if he happens to have one, at home to perform those  hard household duties which fall to the lot of her class; the  children--and there are generally several, for one of the chief luxuries  within the reach of the poor is children--are allowed to take care of  themselves as best they can between times; they naturally go to the  streets to play; they have no gardens, with shady graveled walks running  between beds of bright flowers; no nursery, no governesses, no nurses  with French caps, and, shame be it said, hardly any public parks; there  are not even trees in this great city to cast a shade for these little  creatures in summer nor to help break the force of the wind in  winter--but they play in the streets just the same, and are under no  restraint whatever, and therein lies their temptation. What wonder that  they afterwards people the gilded palaces of vice \"up-town,\" or fill the  prisons of the city and state?    They may be approached by any one, and they are led away by many.  Sometimes the ever-watchful and lynx-eyed Chinaman singles out some  pretty little girl, on the pretense that he has some curious things to  show her in his laundry. Sometimes an old, eminently respectable  gentleman (?) has a package of candy for the little girls. Sometimes,  again, bright-eyed young girls are attracted, like butterflies to bright  flowers, to the gaudy signs of the Bowery museums. Sometimes there are  other inducements, in the way of store windows, or a chance acquaintance  (and they are always around, too, these obliging acquaintances), and the  purchase of some trinkets, then a hotel, a room, and our little friend  has eaten of the apple. But this is premature.    The unconstrained freedom of the street, therefore, is undoubtedly one  great source of danger to the young but there are many others which, in  varying degrees, conspire to ensnare and corrupt them. So that the  wonder is that so many escape rather than that so many are  contaminated.    The manner in which poor people--the very poor--live in this city is, of  itself, fearfully demoralizing in its effects upon their children.  Oftener than otherwise, a family, in some cases six or seven in number,  will occupy but _two_ rooms; one, a kitchen, the other, a _sleeping_  apartment. In the latter room are sometimes the father, mother, one or  two daughters, say ten, twelve or fifteen years of age, and as many  sons, younger or older, as the case may be. Just think of it! think of  the tender age at which these children are familiarized with what should  be as a sealed book. Think of--what frequently happens--a drunken father  reeling to the marriage bed in such a room! Think of brothers and  sisters of such ages lying side by side, and think of the mistakes that  might occur when--which is possible--the whole family may have taken  liquor and the floor is one common bed. There are hundreds of families  living in this big, charitable city in this degrading manner. Is it any  surprise that children here are bad and criminally vicious at five years  of age and upwards?    It not infrequently happens that the parents of families so  circumstanced are sent to the \"Island,\" in which case the children are  then, indeed, upon the streets. Yet they are so precocious and  resourceful that they generally are able to take care of themselves, and  so become flower girls, news girls, wharf rats, etc.    There are yet other causes which go to affect the lives of the children  of the poor. It sometimes happens that the happy and virtuous home of a  comparatively well-to-do mechanic is broken up by unforeseen  circumstances, against which no provident provision, except a life  insurance policy, could guard. The head of the family meets with some  serious accident, incapacitating him for labor, and straightway, instead  of being the breadwinner and family support, he becomes a care and a  burden. The poor wife is thrown upon her resources, and she naturally  invokes the assistance of her children in the desperate endeavor of  maintaining a roof over their heads. In this way the ranks of the flower  and news girls are frequently recruited.    Through the cursed effects of drink, the heads of many families are  frequently sent to the \"Island\" for from ten days to six months, and  when the sheltering arms of some beneficent society, or the kindly  offices of some good Samaritan, are not directed to the forlorn and  destitute condition of the children, the unfortunate young creatures are  forced upon the streets to beg, steal, sell papers, flowers, etc., and  also visit the offices of bankers and brokers, doing anything, in short,  to get the means to live. They live in the streets, sleep in hallways,  alleyways, anywhere, a prey to the first evil-disposed man that meets  them. It is a common sight to see children on the streets in all parts  of the metropolis--boys and girls--aged from five to fifteen years,  selling papers, shoplifting, stealing, and,--worse. Have they parents?  Who knows, who inquires, who cares? Some of them are very pretty girls,  too. All the worse for them.    The same causes which conspire to throw girls upon their own resources  to gain a livelihood, operate with the brothers; but the latter are more  fertile in means of accomplishing that end. Girls can only sell papers,  flowers or themselves, but boys can black boots, sell papers, run  errands, carry bundles, sweep out saloons, steal what is left around  loose everywhere, and gradually perfect themselves for a more advanced  stage and higher grade of crimes, finally developing into fully-fledged  and first-class criminals.    So much for the causes which help to create this class of street Arabs,  whom it is almost a labor of supererogation to describe, especially to  those who daily hear the familiar cries, \"Telegram!\" \"News!\" \"Telegram!\"  \"New-es!\" \"Mail 'n' Express!\" uttered chiefly by young girls, all over  the town. Pretty girls they are, too, many of them, with large, lustrous  eyes, long, well-oiled hair, nice shoes upon their feet, short dresses,  disclosing evidences of graceful forms, ruddy complexions, and armed  with many winsome little actions calculated to conciliate patronage.  They are to be seen on Park Row, the Bowery, Chatham street, around the  post-office, hotels,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#5)"],[1,"  important and interesting remains of ancient painting. We shall only  consider such as have been found in Italy, as those of other countries are  few and unimportant.    The Etruscan tombs which have been opened contain many beautiful objects  of various kinds, and were frequently decorated with mural pictures. They  often consist of several rooms, and have the appearance of being prepared  as a home for the living rather than for the dead. I shall give you no  long or wordy description of them; because if what I tell you leads you to  wish to know more about them, there are many excellent books describing  them which you can read. So I will simply give you two cuts from these  Etruscan paintings, and tell you about them.    Fig. 5 is in a tomb known as the _Grotta della Querciola_. The upper part  represents a feast, and the lower portion a boar-hunt in a wood, which is  indicated by the few trees and the little twigs which are intended to  represent the underbrush of the forest. If we compare these pictures with  the works of the best Italian masters, they seem very crude and almost  childish in their simplicity; but, if we contrast them with the paintings  of the Egyptians and Assyrians, we see that a great advance has been made  since the earliest paintings of which we know were done. The pose and  action of the figures and their grace of movement, as well as the folding  of the draperies, are far better than anything earlier than the Greek  painting of which there is any knowledge; for, as we have said, these  Etruscan works are essentially Greek.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--HUMAN SACRIFICE OFFERED BY ACHILLES TO THE SHADE  OF PATROKLOS. _From an Etruscan wall-painting._]    Fig. 6 belongs to a later period than the other, and is taken from a tomb  at Vulci which was opened in 1857 by Francois. This tomb has seven  different chambers, several of which are decorated with wall-paintings of  mythological subjects. A square chamber at the end of the tomb has the  most important pictures. On one side the human sacrifices which were  customary at Etruscan funerals are represented: the pictures are very  painful, and the terror and agony of the poor victims who are being put to  death make them really repulsive to see. On an opposite wall is the  painting from which our cut is taken. This represents the sacrifices made  before Troy by Achilles, on account of the death of his dear friend  Patroklos. The figure with the hammer is Charon, who stands ready to  receive the sacrifice which is intended to win his favor. Your mythology  will tell you the story, which is too long to be given here. The realism  of this picture is shocking in its effect, and yet there is something  about the manner of the drawing and the arrangement of the whole design  that fixes our attention even while it makes us shudder.    The ancient wall-paintings which have been found in Rome are far more  varied than are those of Etruria; for, while some of the Roman pictures  are found in tombs, others are taken from baths, palaces, and villas. They  generally belong to one period, and that is about the close of the  Republic and the beginning of the Empire. Modern excavations have revealed  many of these ancient paintings; but so many of them crumble and fade away  so soon after they are exposed to the air, that few remain in a condition  to afford any satisfaction in seeing them. But fortunately drawings have  been made of nearly all these pictures before they fell into decay.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE ALDOBRANDINI MARRIAGE. _From a wall-painting  in the Vatican._]    Some of the ancient paintings have been carefully removed from the walls  where they were found, and placed in museums and other collections. One of  the finest of these is in the Vatican, and is called the Aldobrandini  Marriage. It received this name from the fact that Cardinal Aldobrandini  was its first possessor after its discovery, near the Arch of Gallienus,  in 1606.    As you will see from Fig. 7, from it, there are three distinct groups  represented. In the centre the bride veiled, with her head modestly bowed  down, is seated on a couch with a woman beside her who seems to be  arranging some part of her toilet, while another stands near holding  ointment and a bowl. At the head of the couch the bridegroom is seated on  a threshold. The upper part of his figure is bare, and he has a garland  upon his head. On the right of the picture an ante-room is represented in  which are three women with musical instruments, singing sacrificial songs.  To the left, in another apartment, three other women are preparing a bath.  This is charming on account of the sweet, serious way in which the whole  story is placed before us; but as a painting it is an inferior work of  art--not in the least above the style which we should call house  decoration.    Although ancient writers had spoken of landscape paintings, it was not  until 1848-1850, when a series of them was discovered on the Esquiline in  Rome, that any very satisfactory specimens could be shown. These pictures  number eight: six are complete, of the seventh but half remains, and the  eighth is in a very imperfect state. They may be called historical  landscapes, because each one has a complete landscape as well as figures  which tell a story. They illustrate certain passages from the Odyssey of  Homer. The one from which our cut is taken shows the visit of Ulysses to  the lower world. When on the wall the pictures were divided by  pilasters, and finished at the top by a border or frieze. The pilasters  are bright red, and the chief colors in the picture are a yellowish brown  and a greenish blue. In this scene the way in which the light streams  through the entrance to the lower world is very striking, and shows the  many figures there with the best possible effect. Even those in the far  distance on the right are distinctly seen. This collection of Esquiline  wall-paintings is now in the Vatican Library.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--LANDSCAPE ILLUSTRATION TO THE ODYSSEY. _From a  wall-painting discovered on the Esquiline at Rome._]    Besides the ancient mural paintings which have been placed in the museums  of Rome, there are others which still remain where they were painted, in  palaces, villas, and tombs. Perhaps those in the house of Livia are the  most interesting; they represent mythological stories, and one frieze has  different scenes of street life in an ancient town. Though these  decorations are done in a mechanical sort of painting, such as is  practised by the ordinary fresco painters of our own time, yet there was  sufficient artistic feeling in their authors to prevent their repeating  any one design.    One circumstance proves that this class of picture was not thought very  important when it was made, which is that the name of the artist is rarely  found upon his work: in but one instance either in Rome or Pompeii has  this occurred, namely, in a chamber which was excavated in the gardens of  the Farnesina Palace at Rome, and the name is Seleucus.    We have not space to speak of all the Italian cities in which these  remains are discovered, and, as Pompeii is the one most frequently visited  and that in which a very large proportion of the ancient pictures have  been found, I will give a few illustrations from them, and leave the  subject of ancient, mural paintings there. Many of the Pompeian pictures  have been removed to the Museum of Naples, though many still remain where  they were first painted.    The variety of subjects at Pompeii is large: there are landscapes, hunting  scenes, mythological subjects, numerous kinds of single figures, such as  dancing girls, the hours, or seasons, graces, satyrs, and many others;  devotional pictures, such as representations of the ancient divinities,  lares, penates, and genii; pictures of tavern scenes, of mechanics at  their work; rope-dancers and representations of various games,  gladiatorial contests, _genre_ scenes from the lives of children, youths,  and women, festival ceremonies, actors, poets, and stage scenes, and last,  but not least, many caricatures, of which I here give you an example (Fig.  9).    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--THE FLIGHT OF AENEAS. _From a wall-painting._]    The largest dog is AEneas, who leads the little Ascanius by the hand and  carries his father, Anchises, on his shoulder. Frequently in the ancient  caricatures monkeys are made to take the part of historical and imaginary  heroes.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--DEMETER ENTHRONED. _From a Pompeian  wall-painting._]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--POMPEIAN WALL-PAINTING.]    Fig. 11 shows you how these painted walls were sometimes divided; the  principal subjects were surrounded by ornamental borders, and the spaces  between filled in with all sorts of little compartments. The small spaces  in this picture are quite regular in form; but frequently they are of  varied shapes, and give a very decorative effect to the whole work. The  colors used upon these different panels, as they may be called, were  usually red, yellow, black, and white--more rarely blue and green.  Sometimes the entire decoration consisted of these small, variously  colored spaces, divided by some graceful little border, with a very small  figure, plant, or other object in the centre of each space.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--NEST OF CUPIDS. _From a Pompeian  wall-painting._]    Fig. 10, of Demeter, or Ceres, enthroned is an example of such devotional  paintings as were placed above the altars and shrines for private worship  in the houses of Pompeii, or at the street corners, just as we now see  pictures and sacred figures in street shrines in Roman Catholic countries.  In ancient days, as now, these pictures were often done in a coarse and  careless manner, as if religious use, and not art, was the object in the  mind of the artist.    Fig. 12, of a Nest of Cupids is a very interesting example of Pompeian  painting,"]]]
