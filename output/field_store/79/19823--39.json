Her life thus spans one year.    The larva (Fig. 23) is longer than that of Megachile, and compared with  that of Xylocopa, the different segments are much more convex, giving a  serrate outline to the back of the worm. The pupa, or chrysalis, we have  found in the cells the last of July. It is white, and three-tenths of an  inch long. It differs from that of the Leaf-cutter bee in having four  spines on the end of the body.    [Illustration: 23. Larva of Ceratina.]    [Illustration: 24. Nest of Tailor Bee.]    In none of the wild bees are the cells constructed with more nicety than  those of our little Ceratina. She bores out with her jaws a long deep  well just the size of her body, and then stretches a thin, delicate  cloth of silk drawn tight as a drum-head across each end of her  chambers, which she then fills with a mixture of pollen and honey.    [Illustration: 25. Tailor Bee.]    Her young are not, in this supposed retreat, entirely free from danger.  The most invidious foes enter and attack the brood. Three species of  Ichneumon flies, two of which belong to the Chalcid family, lay their  eggs within the body of the larva, and emerge from the dried larva and  pupa skins of the bee, often in great numbers. The smallest parasite,  belonging to the genus Anthophorabia, so called from being first known  as a parasite on another bee (Anthophora), is a minute species found  also abundantly in the tight cells of the Leaf-cutter bee.    The interesting habits of the Leaf-cutting, or Tailor bee (Megachile),  have always attracted attention. This bee is a stout, thick-bodied  insect, with a large, square head, stout, sharp, scissors-like jaws, and  with a thick mass of stout, dense hairs on the under side of the tail  for carrying pollen, as she is not provided with the pollen-basket of  the Honey and Humble bees.    The Megachile lays its eggs in burrows in the stems of the elder (Fig.  24), which we have received from Mr. James Angus; we have also found  them in the hollows of the locust tree. Mr. F. W. Putnam thus speaks of  the economy of M. centuncularis, our most common species. \"My attention  was first called, on the 26th of June, to a female busily engaged in  bringing pieces of leaf to her cells, which she was building under a  board, on the roof of the piazza, directly under my window. Nearly the  whole morning was occupied by the bee in bringing pieces of leaf from a  rose bush growing about ten yards from her cells, returning at intervals  of a half minute to a minute with the pieces, which she carried in such  a manner as not to impede her steps when she alighted near her hole.\"  When the Leaf-cutter bee wishes to cut out a piece of a leaf (Fig. 25)  she alights upon the leaf, and in a few seconds swiftly runs her  scissors-like jaws around through it, bearing off the piece in her hind  legs. \"About noon she had probably completed the cell, upon which she  had been engaged, as, during the afternoon, she was occupied in bringing  pollen, preparatory to laying her single egg in the cell. For about  twenty days the bee continued at work, building new cells and supplying  them with pollen.... On the 28th of July, upon removing the board, it  was found that the bee had made thirty cells, arranged in nine rows of  unequal length, some being slightly curved to adapt them to the space  under the board. The longest row contained six cells, and was two and,  three-quarters inches in length; the whole leaf structure being equal to  a length of fifteen inches. Upon making an estimate of the pieces of  leaf in this structure, it was ascertained that there must have been at  least a thousand pieces used. In addition to the labor of making the  cells, this bee, unassisted in all her duties, had to collect the  requisite amount of pollen (and honey?) for each cell, and lay her eggs  therein, when completed. Upon carefully cutting out a portion of one of  the cells, a full-grown larva was seen engaged in spinning a slight  silken cocoon about the walls of its prison, which were quite hard and  smooth on the inside, probably owing to the movements of the larva, and  the consequent pressing of the sticky particles to the walls. In a short  time the opening made was closed over by a very thin silken web. The  cells, measured on the inside of the hard walls, were .35 of an inch in  length, and .15 in diameter. The natural attitude of the larva is  somewhat curved in its cell, but if straightened, it just equals the  inside length of the cell. On the 31st of July, two female bees came  out, having cut their way through the sides of their cells.\" In three  other cells \"several hundred minute Ichneumons (Anthophorabia  megachilis) were seen, which came forth as soon as the cells were  opened.\"    The habits of the little blue or green Mason bees (Osmia) are quite  varied. They construct their cells in the stems of plants, and in rotten  posts and trees, or, like Andrena, they burrow in sunny banks. A  European species selects snail shells for its nest, wherein it builds  its earthen cells, while other species nidificate under stones. Curtis  found two hundred and thirty cocoons of a British species (Osmia  paretina), placed on the under side of a flat stone, of which one-third  were empty. Of the remainder, the most appeared between March and June,  males appearing first; thirty-five more bees were developed the  following spring. Thus there were three successive broods, for three  succeeding years, so that these bees lived three years before arriving  at maturity. This may partly account for _insect years_, which are like  \"apple years,\" seasons when bees and wasps, as well as other insects,  abound in unusual numbers.    [Illustration: 26. Nest of Osmia.]    Mr. G. R. Waterhouse, in the Transactions of the Entomological Society  of London, for 1864, states that the cells of Osmia leucomelana \"are  formed of mud, and each cell is built separately. The female bee,  having deposited a small pellet of mud in a sheltered spot between some  tufts of grass, immediately begins to excavate a small cavity in its  upper surface, scraping the mud away from the centre towards the margin  by means of her jaws. A small, shallow mud-cup is thus produced. It is  rough and uneven on the outer surface, but beautifully smooth on the  inner. On witnessing thus much of the work performed, I was struck with  three points: first, the rapidity with which the insect worked;  secondly, the tenacity with which she kept her original position whilst  excavating; and thirdly, her constantly going over work which had  apparently been completed.... The lid is excavated and rendered concave  on its outer or upper surface, and is convex and rough on its inner  surface; and, in fact, is a simple repetition of the first-formed  portion of the cell, a part of a hollow sphere.\"    The largest species of Osmia known to us is a very dark-blue species (O.  lignivora). We are indebted to a lady for specimens of the bees with  their cells, which had been excavated in the interior of a maple tree  several inches from the bark. The bee had industriously tunnelled out  this elaborate burrow (Fig. 26), and, in this respect, resembled the  habits of the Carpenter bee more closely than any other species of its  genus.    The tunnel was over three inches long, and about three-tenths of an inch  wide. It contracted a little in width between the cell, showing that the  bee worked intelligently, and wasted no more of her energies than was  absolutely necessary. The burrow contained five cells, each half an inch  long, being rather short and broad, with the hinder end rounded, while  the opposite end, next to the one adjoining, is cut off squarely. The  cell is somewhat jug-shaped, owing to a slight constriction just behind  the mouth. The material of which the cell is composed is stout, silken,  parchment-like, and very smooth within. The interstices between the  cells are filled in with rather coarse chippings made by the bee.    The bee cut its way out of the cells in March, and lived for a month  afterwards on a diet of honey and water. It eagerly lapped up the drops  of water supplied by its keeper, to whom it soon grew accustomed, and  seemed to recognize.    Our smallest and most abundant species is the little green Osmia  simillima. It builds its little oval, somewhat urn-shaped cells against  the roof of the large deserted galls of the oak-gall fly (Diplolepis  confluentus), placing them, in this instance eleven in number, in two  irregular rows, from which the mature bees issue through a hole in the  gall (Fig. 27, with two separate cells). The earthen cells, containing  the tough dense cocoons, were arranged irregularly so as to fit the  concave vault of the larger gall, which was about two inches in  diameter. On emerging from the cell the Osmia cuts out with its powerful  jaws an ovate lid, nearly as large as one side of the cell.    [Illustration: 27. Nest of Osmia in a gall.]    In the Harris collection are the cells and specimens of Osmia pacifica,  the peaceful Osmia, which, according to the manuscript notes of Dr.  Harris, is found in the perfect state in earthen cells beneath stones.  The cell is oval cylindrical, a little contracted as usual with those of  all the species of the genus, thus forming an urn-shaped cell. It is  half an inch long, and nearly three-tenths of an inch wide, while the  cocoon, which is rather thin, is three-tenths of an inch long. We are  not acquainted with the habits of the larva and pupa in this country,  but Mr. F. Smith states that the larva of the English species hatches in  eight days after the eggs are laid, feeds ten to twelve days, when it  becomes full-grown, then spins a thin silken covering, and remains in an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],[0,"The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#5)"],[1,"t.  \"I'm going to school,\" replied Peter  with a great deal of dignity.    \"Going to school!  Ho, ho, ho!  Going to school!\" exclaimed Happy  Jack.  \"Pray tell me to whom you are going to school, and what for?\"    \"I'm going to school to Old Mother Nature,\" retorted Peter.  \"I've  been going for several days, and so has my cousin, Jumper the Hare.  We've learned a lot about our own family and now we are going to  learn about the other little people of the Green Forest and the  Green Meadows.\"    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed Happy Jack.  \"Pooh! I know all about my own family,  and I guess there isn't much worth knowing about my neighbors that  I don't know.\"    \"Is that so, Mr. Know-it-all,\" retorted Peter.  \"I don't believe  you even know all your own cousins.  I thought I knew all mine, but  I found I didn't.\"    \"What are you fellows talking about?\" asked another voice, a sharp  scolding voice, and Chatterer the Red Squirrel jumped from one  tree to another just above Peter's head.    \"Peter is trying to make me believe that I don't know as much as I  might about our own family,\" snapped Happy Jack indignantly.  \"He  is on his way to school to Old Mother Nature and has advised me to  join him.  Isn't that a joke?\"    \"Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't,\" retorted Chatterer, who isn't  the best of friends with his cousin, Happy Jack.  \"If I don't know  as much about the Squirrel family as you do, may I never find another  nut as long as I live.  But at that, I'm not sure I know all there  is to know.  I think it would be fun to go to school for a while.  What do you say, Peter, if I go along with you?\"    Peter said that he thought it would be a very fine thing and that  Chatterer never would regret it.  Chatterer winked at his cousin,  Happy Jack, and followed Peter, only of course, Chatterer kept in  the trees while Peter was on the ground.  Happy Jack hesitated a  minute and then, curiosity becoming too much for him, he hastened  after the others.    \"Hello!\" exclaimed Old Mother Nature, as Happy Jack and Chatterer  appeared with Peter Rabbit.  \"What are you frisky folks doing  over here?\"    Happy Jack and Chatterer appeared to have lost their tongues,  something very unusual for them, especially for Chatterer.  The  fact is, in the presence of Old Mother Nature they felt bashful.  Peter replied for them.  \"They've decided to come to school,  too,\" said he.  \"Happy Jack says he knows all about his own  family, but he has come along to find out if he really does.\"    \"It won't take us long to find out,\" said Old Mother Nature softly  and her eyes twinkled with amusement.  \"How many cousins have  you, Happy Jack?\"    Happy Jack thought for a moment.  \"Three,\" he replied, but he  didn't say it in a very positive way.  Peter chuckled to himself,  for he knew that already doubt was beginning to grow in Happy  Jack's mind.    \"Name them,\" commanded Old Mother Nature promptly.    \"Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Timmy the Flying Squirrel, and  Striped Chipmunk,\" replied Happy Jack.    \"He's forgotten Rusty the Fox Squirrel,\" shouted Chatterer,  dancing about gleefully.    Happy Jack looked crestfallen and gave Chatterer an angry look.    \"That's right, Chatterer,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"Rusty is a  very important member of the Squirrel family.  Now suppose you  name the others.\"    \"Wha--wha--what others?\" stammered Chatterer.  \"I don't know of  any others.\"    Peter Rabbit hugged himself with glee as he watched the faces of  Happy Jack and Chatterer.  \"They don't know any more about their  family than we did about ours,\" he whispered in one of the long  ears of Jumper the Hare.    As for Old Mother Nature, she smiled indulgently.  \"Put on your  thinking-caps, you two,\" said she.  \"You haven't named half of  them.  You are not wholly to blame for that, for some of them you  never have seen, but there is one member of the Squirrel family  whom both of you know very well, yet whom neither of you named.  Put on your thinking-caps.\"    Chatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Chatterer,  and each scratched his head.  Each wanted to be the first to think  of that other cousin, for each was jealous of the other.  But though  they scratched and scratched their heads, they couldn't think who  that other cousin could be.  Old Mother Nature waited a few minutes  before she told them.  Then, seeing that either they couldn't  remember or didn't know, she said, \"You didn't mention Johnny Chuck.\"    \"Johnny Chuck!\" exclaimed Chatterer and Happy Jack together, and  the look of surprise on their faces was funny to see.  For that  matter, the looks on the faces of Peter Rabbit and Jumper the  Hare were equally funny.    Old Mother Nature nodded.  \"Johnny Chuck,\" she repeated.  \"He is a  member of the Squirrel family.  He belongs to the Marmot branch,  but he is a Squirrel just the same.  He is one of your cousins.\"    \"He's a mighty funny looking Squirrel,\" said Chatterer, jerking  his tail as only he can.    \"That just shows your ignorance, Chatterer,\" replied Old Mother  Nature rather sharply.  \"I'm surprised at the ignorance of you  two.\"  She looked first at Chatterer, than at Happy Jack.  \"It is  high time you came to school to me for a while.  You've got a lot  to learn.  For that matter, so have Peter and Jumper.  Now which  of you can tell me what order you all belong to?\"    Happy Jack looked at Chatterer, Chatterer looked at Peter Rabbit,  and Peter looked at Jumper the Hare.  On the face of each was such  a funny, puzzled expression that Old Mother Nature almost laughed  right out.  Finally Peter Rabbit found his tongue.  \"If you please,\"  said he, \"I guess we don't know what you mean by an order.\"    \"I thought as much,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"I thought as much.  In the first place, the animals of the Great World are divided  into big groups or divisions, and then these groups are divided  into smaller groups, and these in turn into still smaller groups.  Happy Jack and Chatterer belong to a group called the Squirrel  family, and Peter and Jumper to a group called the Hare family.  Both of these families and several other families belong to a  bigger group called an order, and this order is the order of  Gnawers, or Rodents.\"    Peter Rabbit fairly jumped up in the air, he was so excited.  \"Then  Jumper and I must be related to Happy Jack and Chatterer,\" he cried.    \"In a way you are,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"It isn't a very  close relationship, still you are related.  All of you are Rodents.  So are all the members of the Rat and Mouse family, the Beaver  family, the Porcupine family, the Pocket Gopher family, the Pika  family, and the Sewellel family.\"    By this time Peter's eyes looked as if they would pop right out of  his head.  \"This is the first time I've ever heard of some of those  families,\" said he.  \"My, what a lot we have to learn!  Is it  because all the members of all those families have teeth for gnawing  that they are all sort of related?\"    Old Mother Nature looked pleased.  \"Peter,\" said she, \"I think you  ought to go to the head of the class.  That is just why.  All the  members of all the families I have named belong to the same order,  the order of Rodents.  All the members have big, cutting, front  teeth.  Animals without such teeth cannot gnaw.  Now, as you and  Jumper have learned about your family, it is the turn of Happy Jack  and Chatterer to learn about their family.  Theirs is rather a large  family, and it is divided into three groups, the first of which  consists of the true Squirrels, to which group both Happy Jack and  Chatterer belong.  The second group consists of the Marmots, and  Johnny Chuck belongs to this.  The third group Timmy the Flying  Squirrel has all to himself.\"    \"Where does Striped Chipmunk come in?\" asked Chatterer.    \"I'm coming to that,\" replied Old Mother Nature.  \"The true Squirrels  are divided into the Tree Squirrels, Rock Squirrels, and Ground  Squirrels.  Of course Chatterer and Happy Jack are Tree Squirrels.\"    \"And Striped Chipmunk is a Ground Squirrel,\" interrupted Peter,  looking as if he felt very much pleased with his own smartness.    Old Mother Nature shook her head.  \"You are wrong this time,  Peter,\" said she, and Peter looked as foolish as he felt.  \"Striped  Chipmunk is a Rock Squirrel.  Seek Seek the Spermophile who lives  on the plains of the West and is often called Gopher Squirrel, is  the true Ground Squirrel.  Now I can't spend any more time with you  little folks this morning, because I've too much to do.  To-morrow  morning I shall expect Chatterer to tell me all about Happy Jack,  and Happy Jack to tell me all about Chatterer.  Now scamper along,  all of you, and think over what you have learned this morning.\"    So Peter and Jumper and Chatterer and Happy Jack thanked Old Mother  Nature for what she had told them and scampered away.  Peter headed  straight for the far corner of the Old Orchard where he was sure he  would find Johnny Chuck.  He couldn't get there fast enough, for he  wanted to be the first to tell Johnny Chuck that he was a Squirrel.  You see he didn't believe that Johnny knew it.        CHAPTER V  The Squirrels of the Trees    Peter Rabbit found Johnny Chuck sitting on his doorstep, sunning  himself.  Peter was quite out of breath because he had hurried so.  \"Do you know that you are a Squirrel, Johnny Chuck?\" he panted.    Johnny slowly turned his head and looked at Peter as if he thought  Peter had suddenly gone crazy.  \"What are you talking about, Peter  Rabbit?  I'm not a Squirrel; I'm a Woodchuck,\" he replied.    \"Just the same, you are a Squirrel,\" retorted Peter.  \"The Woodchucks  belong to the Squirrel family.  Old Mother Nature says so, and if she  says so, it is so.  You'd better join our school, Johnny Chuck, and  learn a little about your own relatives.\"    Johnny Chuck blinked his eyes and for a minute or two couldn't find  a word to say.  He knew that if Peter were telling the truth as to  "]]]
