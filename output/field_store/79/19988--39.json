Blinded  by the whitewash which ran in his eyes, but which, being slaked, did  not burn him, he grouped blindly about, pawing the air with his  outstretched hands.    \"You wait! You wait! You'll suffer for this!\" he spluttered, as soon as  he could free his mouth from the trickling fluid. Then, wiping it from  his face, with his hands, as best he could, he shook his fist at Tom.  \"I'll pay you and that black rascal back!\" he cried. \"You wait!\"    \"I hopes yo' pays me soon,\" answered Eradicate, \"'case as how dat  whitewash was wuff twenty-five cents, an' I got t' go git mo' to finish  doin' a chicken coop I'm wurkin' on. Whoa, dar Boomerang. Dere ain't  goin' t' be no mo' trouble I reckon.\"    Morse did not reply. He had been most unexpectedly repulsed, and, with  the white-wash dripping from his garments, he turned and fairly ran  toward a strip of woodland that bordered the highway at that place.    Tom approached the colored man, and held out a welcoming hand.    \"I don't know what I'd done if you hadn't come along, Rad,\" the lad  said. \"That fellow was desperate, and this was a lonely spot to be  attacked. Your whitewash came in mighty handy.\"    \"Yais, sah, Mistah Swift, dat's what it done. I knowed I could use it  on him, ef he got too obstreperous, an' dat's what he done. But I were  goin' to fight him wif mah bresh, ef he'd made any more trouble.\"    \"Oh, I fancy we have seen the last of him for some time,\" said Tom, but  he looked worried. It was evident that the Happy Harry gang was still  hanging around the neighborhood of Shopton, and the fact that Morse was  bold enough to attack our hero in broad day-light argued that he felt  little fear of the authorities.    \"Ef yo' wants t' catch him, Mistah Swift,\" went on Eradicate, \"yo' kin  trace him by de whitewash what drops offen him,\" and he pointed to a  trail of white drops which showed the path Morse had taken.    \"No, the less I have to do with him the better I like it,\" answered the  lad. \"But I can't thank you enough, Rad. You have helped me out of  difficulties several times now. You put me on the trail of the men in  the deserted mansion, you warned me of the log Andy Foger placed across  the road, and now you have saved me from Morse.\"    \"Oh, dat's nuffin, Mistah Swift. Yo' has suah done lots fo' me.  'Sides, mah mule, Boomerang, am entitled t' de most credit dish yeah  time. I were comin' down de street, on mah way t' a whitewashin' job,  when I seen yo', an yo' lickitysplit machine,\" for so Eradicate  designated a motorcycle. \"I knowed it were yo', an' I didn't laik de  looks ob dat man. Den I see he had hold ob you, an' I t'ought he were a  burglar. So I yelled t' Boomerang t' hurry up. Now, mostly, when I  wants Boomerang t' hurry, he goes slow, an' when I wants him t' go  slow, he runs away. But dish yeah time he knowed he were comin' t' help  yo', an' he certainly did leg it, dat's what he done! He run laik he  were goin' home t' a stable full ob oats, an' dat's how I got heah so  quick. Den I t'ought ob de whitewash, an' I jest used it.\"    \"It was the most effective weapon you could have used,\" said Tom,  gratefully.    \"Deed no, Mistah Swift, I didn't hab no weapon,\" spoke Eradicate  earnestly. \"I ain't eben got mah razor, 'case I left it home. I didn't  hab no weapon at all. I jest used de whitewash, laik yo' seen me.\"    \"That's what I meant,\" answered Tom, trying not to laugh at the simple  negro's misunderstanding. \"I'm ever so much obliged to you, just the  same, and here's a half dollar to pay for the whitewash.\"    \"Oh, no, Mistah Swift, I doan't want t' take it. I kin make mo'  whitewash.\"    But Tom insisted, and picked up his machine to sprint for home.  Eradicate started to tell over again, how he urged Boomerang on, but  the lad had no time to listen.    \"But I didn't hab no weapon, Mistah Swift, no indeedy, none at all, not  even mah razor,\" repeated Eradicate. \"Only de pail ob whitewash.  That  is, lessen yo' calls mah bresh a weapon.\"    \"Well, it's a sort of one,\" admitted Tom, with a laugh as he started  his machine. \"Come around next week, Rad. We have some dirt eradicating  for you to attend to.\"    \"Deed an' I will, Mistah Swift. Eradicate is mah name, an' I eradicates  de dirt. But dat man such did look odd, wif dat pail ob whitewash all  ober him. He suah did look most extraordinarily. Gidap, Boomerang. See  if yo' can break some mo' speed records now.\"    But the mule appeared to be satisfied with what he had done, and, as he  rode off, Tom looked back to see the colored man laboring to get the  sleepy, animal started.    The lad did not tell his father of the adventure with Morse, but he  related the occurrence to Mr. Sharp.    \"I'd like to get hold of that scoundrel, and the others in the gang!\"  exclaimed the balloonist. \"I'd take him up in the airship, and drop him  down into the lake. He's a bad man. So are the others. Wonder what they  want around here?\"    \"That's what's puzzling me,\" admitted Tom. \"I hope dad doesn't hear  about them or he will be sure to worry; and maybe it will interfere  with his new ideas.\"    \"He hasn't told you yet what he's engaged in inventing; has he?\"    \"No, and I don't like to ask him. He said the other day, though, that  it would rival our airship, but in a different way.\"    \"I wonder what he meant?\"    \"It's hard to say. But I don't believe he can invent anything that will  go ahead of our craft, even if he is my own father, and the best one in  the world,\" said Tom, half jokingly. \"Well, I got the bolts, now let's  get to work. I'm anxious for a trial trip.\"    \"No more than I am. I want to see if my ideas will work out in practice  as well as they do in theory.\"    For a week or more Tom and Mr. Sharp labored on the airship, with Mr.  Jackson to help them. The motor, with its twenty cylinders, was  installed, and the big aluminum holder fastened to the frame of the  planes. The rudders, one to control the elevation and depression of the  craft, and the other to direct its flight to the right or left, were  attached, and the steering wheel, as well as the levers regulating the  motor were put in place.    \"About all that remains to be done now,\" said the aeronaut one night,  as he and Tom stood in the big shed, looking at their creation, \"is to  fit up the car, and paint the machine.\"    \"Can't we make a trial trip before we fit up the car ready for a long  flight?\" asked the young inventor.    \"Yes, but I wouldn't like to go out without painting the ship. Some  parts of it might rust if we get into the moist, cloudy, upper regions.\"    \"Then let's paint it to-morrow, and, as soon as it's dry we'll have a  test.\"    \"All right. I'll mix the paint the first thing in the morning.\"    It took two days to paint the machine, for much care had to be used,  and, when it was finished Tom looked admiringly up at it.    \"We ought to name it,\" suggested Mr. Sharp, as he removed a bit of  paint from the end of the nose.    \"To be sure,\" agreed Tom. \"And hold on, I have the very name for  it--Red Cloud!\"    \"Red Cloud?\" questioned Mr. Sharp.    \"Yes!\" exclaimed Tom, with enthusiasm. \"It's painted red--at least the  big, aluminum gas container is--and we hope to go above the clouds in  it. Why not Red Cloud?\"    \"That's what it shall be!\" conceded the balloonist. \"If I had a bottle  of malted milk, or something like that, I'd christen it.\"    \"We ought to have a young lady to do that part,\" suggested Tom. \"They  always have young ladies to name ships.\"    \"Were you thinking of any particular young lady?\" asked Mr. Sharp  softly, and Tom blushed; as he replied:    \"Oh no--of course that is--well--Oh, hang it, christen it yourself, and  let me alone,\" he finished.    \"Well, in the absence of Miss Mary Nestor, who, I think, would be the  best one for the ceremony,\" said Mr. Sharp, with a twinkle in his eyes,  \"I christen thee Red Cloud,\" and with that he sprinkled some water on  the pointed nose of the red aluminum gas bag, for the aeronaut and Tom  were on a high staging, on a level with the upper part of the airship.    \"Red Cloud it is!\" cried Tom, enthusiastically. \"Now, to-morrow we'll  see what it can do.\"    The day of the test proved all that could be desired in the way of  weather. The fact that an airship was being constructed in the Swift  shops had been kept as secret as possible, but of course many in  Shopton knew of it, for Andy Foger had spread the tidings.    \"I hope we won't have a crowd around to see us go up,\" said Tom, as he  and Mr. Sharp went to the shed to get the Red Cloud in readiness for  the trial. \"I shouldn't want to have them laugh at us, if we fail to  rise.\"    \"Don't worry. We'll go up all right,\" declared Mr. Sharp. \"The only  thing I'm at all worried about is our speed. I want to go fast, but we  may not be able to until our motor gets 'tuned-up'.  But we'll rise.\"    The gas machine had already been started, and the vapor was hissing  inside the big aluminum holder. It was decided to try to go up under  the lifting power of the gas, and not use the aeroplane feature for  sending aloft the ship, as there was hardly room, around the shops, for  a good start.    When enough of the vapor had been generated to make the airship  buoyant, the big doors of the shed were opened, and Tom and Mr. Sharp,  with the aid of Garret and Mr. Swift, shoved it slowly out.    \"There it is! There she comes!\" cried several voices outside the high  fence that surrounded the Swift property. \"They're going up!\"    \"Andy Foger is in that bunch,\" remarked Tom with a grim smile. \"I hope  we don't fail.\"    \"We won't. Don't worry,\" advised Mr. Sharp.    The shouts outside the fence increased.

On the other hand, the  rubber tube is an inconvenience on account of its weight and the  consequent pull on the end of the apparatus, and makes rotation  difficult.      EXERCISE NO. 3    THE \"TEE\" TUBE    The operations involved are two: the blowing of a short side tube on a  piece of tubing, and sealing another piece of tubing on this, by what is  essentially the second method as just described.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The \"tee\" tube.]    The two pieces of tubing to be used each have one end cut square and the  other sealed in the usual manner. The longer of the two is now heated at  the point at which the joint is to be made, until it begins to color the  flame. A small flame is used, and the tube rotated until the flame  begins to be colored, when the rotation is stopped, and only one spot  heated until a spot the diameter of the tube to be sealed on has become  red hot and begun to shrink. This is now gently blown out into a small  bulb, as in _a_, Fig. 7, and it will be noted that this bulb will have  walls tapering from the thick walls of the tube to a very thin wall at  the top. The sides of this bulb, below the dotted line, are to form the  small side tube to which the main side tube is to be sealed. The top of  the bulb is now softened by directing a small flame directly upon it,  and as soon as it shrinks to the level indicated by the dotted line, it  is removed from the flame and quickly blown out to form a thin bulb, as  indicated in _b_, Fig. 7. This will usually be so very thin that a  stroke of the file or glass-knife will break it off at the dotted line,  leaving the side tube, to which the short piece of tubing is now sealed  according to the second method (Exercise No 2). In doing this, care is  taken to direct the flame partly on the main tube in the two crotches,  so that both tubes blow out a little and give space for the gases to  turn in, as indicated in _c_, Fig. 7, and at the same time increase the  mechanical strength of the job. On the other hand, care is taken not to  deform the main tube, and not to produce such a bulge or bulb at the  joint as will prevent the finished tube from lying flat on a table.    =Discussion.=--Most beginners tend to err in the first steps of this  operation, by blowing too hard and too long when blowing out the little  bulb. The result is a large, very thin bulb, which breaks off in such a  way as to leave a hole in the main tube, occupying nearly half the  circumference of the tube at that point, instead of the neat side tube  which they should have. It is not difficult to seal a tube on this side  tube, but it is very difficult to seal a tube into a hole in another  tube. Care should be taken here, as in the two previous exercises, that  the lump obtained at the joint when the two tubes are put together is  made as small as possible, and reduced if possible by gently drawing on  the side tube as soon as the tubes have actually joined. It is much  easier to prevent the formation of a lump at the joint than it is to  remove the lump after it is formed. The remarks previously made about  blowing quickly after removing the work from the flame apply here with  especial force. A \"tee\" tube, from its very nature, is exposed to a good  many strains, so care must be taken that the walls of the joint are of  uniform thickness with the rest of the tube.    The beginner will find it easiest to make this tube out of two pieces of  the same tube, about 1/4 inch in diameter. Larger or smaller tubing is  usually more difficult. If tubing much more than 1/4 inch is used, the  whole joint, including part of the main tube, must be heated nearly to  the softening point at the close of the operation, and well annealed, as  described in Chapter 1 (page 3) or it will be almost certain to crack.  In the larger sizes of tube it will be necessary to heat the whole  circumference of the main tube frequently during the operation, to  prevent it from cracking.    In sealing a small tube on the side of a large one, it is usually  advisable, after warming the spot where the joint is to be made, to  attach a small drop of glass to the tube at that point, and direct the  flame upon that, thus supplying at the same time both a definite point  to be heated and an extra supply of glass for the little side tube which  is desired. In this way it is also easier to blow out a side tube with a  sufficiently small diameter. If the diameter of this tube should be much  greater than that of the small tube, the latter may be enlarged with a  carbon or a flanging tool.      EXERCISE NO. 4    TO JOIN TWO TUBES OF DIFFERENT DIAMETERS    In this case the first method (Exercise No. 1) is to be used whenever  possible, as it gives a much smoother joint than the second method. The  directions given will describe the adaptation of this method to the  problem: if the second method must be used on account of awkward shape,  etc., of the work, the modifications required will be obvious to any one  who has learned to make the joint by the first method.    After sealing or corking one end of the larger tube, the other end is  drawn out to form a tail as described on page 9, taking care to have the  tube uniformly heated, and to draw the tail rapidly enough so that the  cone is short, as indicated in _a_, Fig. 8. The tube is now rotated, a  small flame directed against the cone at right angles to an element of  it, and it is allowed to shrink a little, as indicated in _b_, Fig. 8,  so that its walls will thicken. When the tail is cut off, at the dotted  line, the diameter of the opening and the thickness of the walls at that  point should correspond with the dimensions of the tube to be sealed on.  As the glass is hot, the scratch for cutting it must be made with a file  (moisten the edge!), and it often will not break square across. Before  proceeding to seal on the small tube, any large projections on the cut  end are best removed, by warming the cut surface a little, directing the  small flame upon each projection in turn and touching it with a warm  scrap of glass. It will adhere to this and may then be removed by  rotating this scrap a little so as to wind up the projection on it, and  then drawing it off, while the flame is still playing on the spot. This  must be done rapidly and care taken not to soften the main part of the  cone.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Joining two tubes of different diameters.]    The large tube is now taken in the left hand, the small one in the  right, the ends heated and joined in the usual manner, taking care not  to get any larger lump at the joint than necessary. A small flame is now  directed on the cone at right angles to its elements as before, and the  tube rotated so as to heat the whole circumference. The flame should be  just large enough to heat the whole of the cone. As the latter shrinks,  the lump at the joint is brought into the edge of the flame, and it and  a very little of the small tube allowed to shrink with the cone.    When well shrunk and heated to blowing temperature the joint is removed  from the flame and blown gently with careful rotation, pushing the tubes  together a little when the blowing is about finished, so that the cone  becomes a short thick half-bulb, as shown in _d_, Fig. 8. This  corresponds to the first thick bulb in the first method (_d_, Fig. 6),  and is treated similarly. It is again heated and shrunk, taking care not  to involve either the large tube or the small one in the shrinking,  blown quickly to about the same shape as before, (_d_, Fig. 8), and then  gently drawn out into a smooth cone (_e_), exactly as in the first  exercise. Care should be taken not to draw too rapidly or too far, as  then the resulting cone (_f_) is weaker than it should be, and does not  look well.    =Discussion.=--The beginner will find that this operation is best  learned on two tubes which are not too nearly of the same diameter. A  tube about 5/8 inch in diameter and one a little less than 1/4 inch will  be suitable. Both should have moderately heavy walls (1/16 inch or a  trifle over for the large tube, and a trifle less for the small one) but  the large tube should not be too heavy or else it will be hard to  prevent melting down too much of the small tube, and getting this drawn  out too thin during the process. One of the troublesome features of this  exercise is the difficulty of rotating two tubes of different diameters  with the same angular velocity, so as not to twist the joint. Another  difficulty is found in getting the cone uniformly heated to blowing  temperature without overheating and overshrinking the small tube. The  reason for this is obviously the much greater circumference of the cone,  especially at its large end, so that relatively much less of it is being  heated at any time. The beginner is also inclined to start with too long  a cone, or else heat so much of the large tube that part of its glass is  included in the cone, with the result that in order to get the right  wall-thickness the cone must be made too long (_g_, Fig. 8). This does  not look well, and usually will be irregular in shape.      EXERCISE NO. 5    TUBE FOR CONDENSING SULPHUR DIOXIDE    This is useful as a test of mastery of the preceding exercise. A piece  of 3/16 or 7/32 inch tubing is joined to each end of a piece of tubing  5/8 by about 5 inches, and two constrictions made in the large tube, by  the method described on page 10. The small tubes are then bent in the  same plane, as shown, and their ends fire-polished (Fig. 9).    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Tube for condensing sulphur dioxide.]      EXERCISE NO. 6    BULB AT THE END OF A TUBE    For this exercise tubing of 1/4 inch diameter and moderately strong  walls is selected. A tail is drawn out on one end of the tube, and a  piece of tubing about nine or ten inches long is cut off. The tail  should be carefully drawn in the axis of the tube, and"]]]
