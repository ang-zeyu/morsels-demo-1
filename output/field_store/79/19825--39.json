Where wert thou last night? Of what kin art thou?\"    Said the cowled man: \"Quick come thy questions, good fellow! but hast  thou skill to understand if I shall tell thee hereof?\"    \"Yea, certes,\" said the lad.    \"Well,\" said the cowl-bearer, \"Thief is my name, with Wolf was I last  night, and in Grief-ham was I reared.\"    Then ran the lad back to the king, and told him the answer of the  new-comer.    \"Well told, lad,\" said the king; \"but for that land of Grief-ham, I know  it well: it may well be that the man is of no light heart, and yet a  wise man shall he be, and of great worth I account him.\"    Said the queen: \"A marvellous fashion of thine, that thou must needs  talk so freely with every carle that cometh hither! Yea, what is the  worth of him, then?\"    \"That wottest thou no clearer than I,\" said the king; \"but I see that he  thinketh more than he talketh, and is peering all about him.\"    Therewith the king sent a man after him, and so the cowl-bearer went up  before the king, going somewhat bent, and greeted him in a low voice.  Then said the king: \"What art thou called, thou big man?\"    And the cowl-bearer answered and sang:              \"Peace-thief they called me            On the prow with the Vikings;            But War-thief whenas            I set widows a-weeping;            Spear-thief when I            Sent forth the barbed shafts;            Battle-thief when I            Burst forth on the king;            Hel-thief when I            Tossed up the small babies:            Isle-thief when I            In the outer isles harried;            Slaws-thief when I            Sat aloft over men:            Yet since have I drifted            With salt-boiling carls,            Needy of help            'Ere hither I came.\"    Said the king: \"Thou hast gotten thy name of Thief from many a matter,  then; but where wert thou last night, and what is thy home?\"    The cowl-bearer said: \"In Grief-ham I grew up; but heart drave me  hither, and home have I nowhere.\"    The king said: \"Maybe indeed that thou hast been nourished in Grief-ham  a certain while; yet also maybe that thou wert born in a place of peace.  But in the wild-wood must thou have lain last night, for no goodman  dwelleth anigh named Wolf; but whereas thou sayest thou hast no home,  so is it, that thou belike deemest thy home nought, because of thy heart  that drave thee hither.\"    Then spake Ingibiorg: \"Go, Thief, get thee to some other harbour, or in  to the guest-hall.\"    \"Nay,\" said the king, \"I am old enow to know how to marshal guests; so  do off thy cowl, new-comer, and sit down on my other hand.\"    \"Yea, old, and over old,\" said the queen, \"when thou settest  staff-carles by thy side.\"    \"Nay, lord, it beseemeth not,\" said Thief; \"better it were as the  queen sayeth. I have been more used to boiling salt than sitting beside  lords.\"    \"Do thou my will,\" said the king, \"for I will rule this time.\"    So Thief cast his cowl from him, and was clad thereunder in a dark blue  kirtle; on his arm, moreover, was the goodly gold ring, and a thick  silver belt was round about him, with a great purse on it, and therein  silver pennies glittering; a sword was girt to his side, and he had a  great fur hood on his head, for his eyes were bleared, and his face all  wrinkled.    \"Ah! now we fare better, say I,\" quoth the king; \"but do thou, queen,  give him a goodly mantle, well shapen for him.\"    \"Thou shalt rule, my lord,\" said the queen; \"but in small account do I  hold this Thief of thine.\"    So then he gat a good mantle over him, and sat down in the high-seat  beside the king.    The queen waxed red as blood when she saw the goodly ring, yet would she  give him never a word; but the king was exceeding blithe with him and  said: \"A goodly ring hast thou on thine arm there; thou must have boiled  salt long enough to get it.\"    Says he, \"That is all the heritage of my father.\"    \"Ah!\" says the king, \"maybe thou hast more than that; well, few  salt-boiling carles are thy peers, I deem, unless eld is deep in mine  eyes now.\"    So Thief was there through the winter amid good entertainment, and well  accounted of by all men; he was bounteous of his wealth, and joyous with  all men: the queen held but little converse with him; but the king and  he were ever blithe together.          CHAPTER XII.     Frithiof saves the King and Queen on the Ice.    The tale tells that on a time King Ring and the queen, and a great  company, would go to a feast. So the king spake to Thief: \"Wilt thou  fare with us, or abide at home?\"    He said he had liefer go; and the king said: \"Then am I the more  content.\"    So they went on their ways, and had to cross a certain frozen water.  Then said Thief: \"I deem this ice untrustworthy; meseemeth ye fare  unwarily.\"    Quoth the king: \"It is often shown how heedful in thine heart thou wilt  be to us.\"    So a little after the ice broke in beneath them, and Thief ran thereto,  and dragged the wain to him, with all that was therein; and the king and  the queen both sat in the same: so Thief drew it all up on to the ice,  with the horses that were yoked to the wain.    Then spake King Ring: \"Right well drawn, Thief! Frithiof the Bold  himself would have drawn no stronger had he been here; doughty followers  are such as thou!\"    So they came to the feast, and there is nought to tell thereof, and the  king went back again with seemly gifts.          CHAPTER XIII.     The King sleeps before Frithiof.    Now weareth away the mid-winter, and when spring cometh, the weather  groweth fair, the wood bloometh, the grass groweth, and ships may glide  betwixt land and land. So on a day the king says to his folk: \"I will  that ye come with us for our disport out into the woods, that we may  look upon the fairness of the earth.\"    So did they, and went flock-meal with the king into the woods; but so it  befell, that the king and Frithiof were gotten alone together afar from  other men, and the king said he was heavy, and would fain sleep. Then  said Thief: \"Get thee home, then, lord, for it better beseemeth men of  high estate to lie at home than abroad.\"    \"Nay,\" said the king, \"so will I not do.\" And he laid him down  therewith, and slept fast, snoring loud.    Thief sat close by him, and presently drew his sword from his sheath and  cast it far away from him.    A little while after the king woke up, and said: \"Was it not so,  Frithiof, that a many things came into thy mind e'en now? But well hast  thou dealt with them, and great honour shalt thou have of me. Lo, now, I  knew thee straightway that first evening thou earnest into our hall: now  nowise speedily shalt thou depart from us; and somewhat great abideth  thee.\"    Said Frithiof: \"Lord king, thou hast done to me well, and in friendly  wise; but yet must I get me gone soon, because my company cometh  speedily to meet me, as I have given them charge to do.\"    So then they rode home from the wood, and the king's folk came flocking  to him, and home they fared to the hall and drank joyously; and it was  made known to all folk that Frithiof the Bold had been abiding there  through the winter-tide.          CHAPTER XIV.     King Ring's Gift to Frithiof.    Early of a morning-tide one smote on the door of that hall, wherein  slept the king and queen, and many others: then the king asked who it  was that called at the hall door; and so he who was without said: \"Here  am I, Frithiof; and I am arrayed for my departure.\"    Then was the door opened, and Frithiof came in, and sang a stave:              \"Have great thanks for the guesting            Thou gavest with all bounty;            Dight fully for wayfaring            Is the feeder of the eagle;            But, Ingidiorg, I mind thee            While yet on earth we tarry;            Live gloriously! I give thee            This gift for many kisses.\"    And therewith he cast the goodly ring towards Ingibiorg, and bade her  take it.    The king smiled at this stave of his, and said: \"Yea, forsooth, she hath  more thanks for thy winter quarters than I; yet hath she not been more  friendly to thee than I.\"    Then sent the king his serving-folk to fetch victuals and drink, and  saith that they must eat and drink before Frithiof departed. \"So arise,  queen, and be joyful!\" But she said she was loth to fall a-feasting so  early.    \"Nay, we will eat all together,\" said King Ring; and they did so.    But when they had drank a while King Ring spake: \"I would that thou  abide here, Frithiof; for my sons are but children and I am old, and  unmeet for the warding of my realm, if any should bring war against it.\"  Frithiof said: \"Speedily must I be gone, lord.\" And he sang:              \"Oh, live, King Ring,            Both long and hale!            The highest king            Neath heaven's skirt!            Ward well, O king,            Thy wife and land,            For Ingibiorg now            Never more shall I meet.\"    Then quoth King Ring:              \"Fare not away,            O Frithiof, thus,            With downcast heart,            O dearest of chieftains!            For now will I give thee            For all thy good gifts,            Far better things            Than thou wottest thyself.\"    And again he sang:              \"To Frithiof the famous            My fair wife I give,            And all things therewith            That are unto me.\"    Then Frithiof took up the word and sang:              \"Nay, how from thine hands            These gifts may I have,            But if thou hast fared            By the last way"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24421"],[0,"The Story of Gunnlaug the Worm-Tongue and Raven the Skald (#5)"],[1,"to go a-wooing to  Thorstein Egilson, to bid Helga his daughter.\"    Skapti answered, \"But is she not already vowed to Gunnlaug Worm-tongue?\"    Said Raven, \"Is not the appointed time of waiting between them passed  by? And far too wanton is he withal, that he should hold or heed it  aught.\"    \"Let us then do as thou wouldst,\" said Skapti.    Thereafter they went with many men to the booth of Thorstein Egilson,  and he greeted them well.    Then Skapti spoke: \"Raven, my kinsman, is minded to woo thy daughter  Helga. Thou knowest well his blood, his wealth, and his good manners,  his many mighty kinsmen and friends.\"    Thorstein said, \"She is already the vowed maiden of Gunnlaug, and with  him shall I hold all words spoken.\"    Skapti said, \"Are not the three winters worn now that were named between  you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Thorstein; \"but the summer is not yet worn, and he may still  come out this summer.\"    Then Skapti said, \"But if he cometh not this summer, what hope may we  have of the matter then?\"    Thorstein answered, \"We are like to come here next summer, and then  may we see what may wisely be done, but it will not do to speak hereof  longer as at this time.\"    Thereon they parted. And men rode home from the Althing. But this talk  of Raven's wooing of Helga was nought hidden.    That summer Gunnlaug came not out.    The next summer, at the Althing, Skapti and his folk pushed the wooing  eagerly, and said that Thorstein was free as to all matters with  Gunnlaug.    Thorstein answered, \"I have few daughters to see to, and fain am I that  they should not be the cause of strife to any man. Now I will first see  Illugi the Black.\" And so he did. .    And when they met, he said to Illugi, \"Dost thou not think that I am  free from all troth with thy son Gunnlaug?\"    Illugi said, \"Surely, if thou wiliest it. Little can I say herein, as I  do not know clearly what Gunnlaug is about.\"    Then Thorstein went to Skapti, and a bargain was struck that the wedding  should be at Burg, about winter-nights, if Gunnlaug did not come out  that summer; but that Thorstein should be free from all troth with Raven  if Gunnlaug should come and fetch his bride.    After this men ride home from the Thing, and Gunnlaug's coming was long  drawn out. But Helga thought evilly of all these redes.          CHAPTER XI.     Of how Gunnlaug must needs abide away from Iceland.    Now it is to be told of Gunnlaug that he went from Sweden the same  summer that Raven went to Iceland, and good gifts he had from King Olaf  at parting.    King Ethelred welcomed Gunnlaug worthily, and that winter he was with  the king, and was held in great honour.    In those days Knut the Great, son of Svein, ruled Denmark, and had  new-taken his father's heritage, and he vowed ever to wage war on  England, for that his father had won a great realm there before he died  west in that same land.    And at that time there was a great army of Danish men west there, whose  chief was Heming, the son of Earl Strut-Harald, and brother to Earl  Sigvaldi, and he held for King Knut that land that Svein had won.    Now in the spring Gunnlaug asked the king for leave to go away, but he  said, \"It ill beseems that thou, my man, shouldst go away now, when all  bodes such mighty war in the land.\"    Gunnlaug said, \"Thou shalt rule, lord; but give me leave next summer to  depart, if the Danes come not.\"    The king answered, \"Then we shall see.\"    Now this summer went by, and the next winter, but no Danes came; and  after midsummer Gunnlaug got his leave to depart from the king, and went  thence east to Norway, and found Earl Eric in Thrandheim, at Hladir, and  the earl greeted him well, and bade him abide with him. Gunnlaug thanked  him for his offer, but said he would first go out to Iceland, to look to  his promised maiden.    The earl said, \"Now all ships bound for Iceland have sailed.\"    Then said one of the court, \"Here lay, yesterday, Hallfred  Troublous-Skald, out tinder Agdaness.\"    The earl answered, \"That may well be; he sailed hence five nights ago.\"    Then Earl Eric had Gunnlaug rowed put to Hallfred, who greeted him with  joy; and forthwith a fair wind bore them from land, and they were right  merry.    This was late in the summer: but now Hallfred said to Gunnlaug, \"Hast  thou heard of how Raven, the son of Onund, is wooing Helga the Fair?\"    Gunnlaug said he had heard thereof but dimly. Hallfred tells him all he  knew of it, and therewith, too, that it was the talk of many men that  Raven was in nowise less brave a man than Gunnlaug. Then Gunnlaug sang  this stave:--              \"Light the weather wafteth;            But if this east wind drifted            Week-long, wild upon us            Little were I recking;            More this word I mind of            Me with Raven mated,            Than gain for me the gold-foe            Of days to make me grey-haired.\"    Then Hallfred said, \"Well, fellow, may'st thou fare better in thy strife  with Raven than I did in mine. I brought my ship some winters ago into  Leiruvag, and had to pay a half-mark in silver to a house-carle of  Raven's, but I held it back from him. So Raven rode at us with sixty  men, and cut the moorings of the ship, and she was driven up on the  shallows, and we were bound for a wreck. Then I had to give selfdoom  to Raven, and a whole mark I had to pay; and that is the tale of my  dealings with him.\"    Then they two talked together alone of Helga the Fair, and Gunnlaug  praised her much for her goodliness; and Gunnlaug sang:--              \"He who brand of battle            Beareth over-wary,            Never love shall let him            Hold the linen-folded;            For we when we were younger            In many a way were playing            On the outward nesses            From golden land outstanding.\"    \"Well sung!\" said Hallfred.          CHAPTER XII. Of Gunnlaug's landing, and how he found Helga wedded to Raven.    They made land north by Fox-Plain, in Hraunhaven, half a month before  winter, and there unshipped their goods. Now there was a man called  Thord, a bonder's son of the Plain, there. He fell to wrestling with the  chapmen, and they mostly got worsted at his hands.    Then a wrestling was settled between him and Gunnlaug. The night before  Thord made vows to Thor for the victory; but the next day, when they  met, they fell-to wrestling. Then Gunnlaug tripped both feet from under  Thord, and gave him a. great fall; but the foot that Gunnlaug stood on  was put out of joint, and Gunnlaug fell together with Thord.    Then said Thord, \"Maybe that other things go no better for thee.\"    \"What then?\" says Gunnlaug.    \"Thy dealings with Raven, if he wed Helga the Fair at winter-nights. I  was anigh at the Thing when that was settled last summer.\"    Gunnlaug answered naught thereto.    Now the foot was swathed, and put into joint again, and it swelled  mightily; but he and Hallfred ride twelve in company till they come to  Gilsbank, in Burg-firth, the very Saturday night when folk sat at the  wedding at Burg. Illugi was fain of his son Gunnlaug and his fellows;  but Gunnlaug said he would ride then and there down to Burg. Illugi said  it was not wise to do so, and to all but Gunnlaug that seemed good. But  Gunnlaug was then unfit to walk, because of his foot, though he would  not let that be seen. Therefore there was no faring to Burg.    On the morrow Hallfred rode to Hreda-water, in North-water dale, where  Galti, his brother and a brisk man, managed their matters.          CHAPTER XIII. Of the Winter-Wedding at Skaney, and how Gunnlaug  gave the Kings Cloak to Helga.    Tells the tale of Raven, that he sat at his weddings-feast at Burg, and  it was the talk of most men that the bride was but drooping; for true is  the saw that saith, \"Long we remember what youth gained us,\" and even so  it was with her now.    But this new thing befell at the feast, that Hungerd, the daughter  of Thorod and Jofrid, was wooed by a man named Sverting, the son of  Hafr-Biorn, the son of Mold-Gnup, and the wedding was to come off that  winter after Yule, at Skaney, where dwelt Thorkel, a kinsman of Hungerd,  and son of Torn Valbrandsson; and the mother of Torn was Thorodda, the  sister of Odd of the Tongue.    Now Raven went home to Mossfell with Helga his wife. When they had been  there a little while, one morning early before they rose up, Helga was  awake, but Raven slept, and fared ill in his sleep. And when he woke  Helga asked him what he had dreamt. Then Raven sang:--              \"In thine arms, so dreamed I,            Hewn was I, gold island!            Bride, in blood I bled there,            Bed of thine was reddened.            Never more then mightst thou,            Mead-bowl'spourer speedy,            Bind my gashes bloody--            Lind-leek-bough thou likst it.\"    Helga spake: \"Never shall I weep therefor,\" quoth she; \"ye have evilly  beguiled me, and Gunnlaug has surely come out.\" And therewith she wept  much.    But, a little after, Gunnlaug's coming was bruited about, and Helga  became so hard with Raven, that he could not keep her at home at  Mossfell; so that back they had to go to Burg, and Raven got small share  of her company.    Now men get ready for the winter-wedding. Thorkel of Skaney bade Illugi  the Black and his sons. But when master Illugi got ready, Gunnlaug sat  in the hall, and stirred not to go. Illugi went up to him and said, \"Why  dost thou not get ready, kinsman?\"    Gunnlaug answered, \"I have no mind to go.\"    Says Illugi, \"Nay, but certes thou shalt go, kinsman,\" says he; \"and  cast thou not grief over thee by yearning for one woman. Make as if thou  knewest nought of it, for women thou wilt never lack.\"    Now Gunnlaug did as his father bade him; so they came to the wedding,  and Illugi and his sons were set down in the high seat; but Thorstein  Egilson, and Raven his son-in-law, and the bridegroom's following, were  set in the"]]]
