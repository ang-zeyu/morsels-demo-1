A painful cough occurs in pleurisy, also in laryngitis,  bronchitis, and bronchial pneumonia. Pain is shown by the effort the  animal exerts to repress the cough. The cough is not painful, as a rule,  in the chronic diseases of the respiratory tract. The force of the cough  is considerable when it is not especially painful and when the lungs are  not seriously involved. When the lungs are so diseased that they can not  be filled with a large volume of air, and in heaves, the cough is weak,  as it is also in weak, debilitated animals. If mucus or pus is coughed  out, or if the cough is accompanied by a gurgling sound, it is said to  be moist; it is dry when these characteristics are not present--that is,  when the air in passing out passes over surface not loaded with  secretion.    In the examination of the chest we resort to percussion and  auscultation. When a cask or other structure containing air is tapped  upon, or percussed, a hollow sound is given forth. If the cask contains  fluid, the sound is of a dull and of quite a different character.  Similarly, the amount of air contained in the lungs can be estimated by  tapping upon, or percussing, the walls of the chest. Percussion is  practiced with the fingers alone or with the aid of a special percussion  hammer and an object to strike upon known as a pleximeter. If the  fingers are used, the middle finger of the left hand should be pressed  firmly against the side of the horse and should be struck with the ends  of the fingers of the right hand bent at a right angle so as to form a  hammer. The percussion hammer sold by instrument makers is made of  rubber or has a rubber tip, so that when the pleximeter, which is placed  against the side, is struck the impact will not be accompanied by a  noise. After experience in this method of examination one can determine  with a considerable degree of accuracy whether the lung contains a  normal amount of air or not. If, as in pneumonia, air has been displaced  by inflammatory product occupying the air space, or if fluid collects in  the lower part of the chest, the percussion sound becomes dull. If, as  in emphysema, or in pneumothorax, there is an excess of air in the  chest cavity, the percussion sound becomes abnormally loud and clear.    Auscultation consists in the examination of the lungs with the ear  applied closely to the chest wall. As the air goes in and out of the  lungs a certain soft sound is made which can be heard distinctly,  especially upon inspiration. This sound is intensified by anything that  accelerates the rate of respiration, such as exercise. This soft,  rustling sound is known as vesicular murmur, and wherever it is heard it  signifies that the lung contains air and is functionally active. The  vesicular murmur is weakened when there is an inflammatory infiltration  of the lung tissue or when the lungs are compressed by fluid in the  chest cavity. The vesicular murmur disappears when air is excluded by  the accumulation, of inflammatory product, as in pneumonia, and when the  lungs are compressed by fluid in the chest cavity. The vesicular murmur  becomes rough and harsh in the early stages of inflammation of the  lungs, and this is often the first sign of the beginning of pneumonia.    By applying the ear over the lower part of the windpipe in front of the  breastbone a somewhat harsh, blowing sound may be heard. This is known  as the bronchial murmur and is heard in normal conditions near the lower  part of the trachea and to a limited extent in the anterior portions of  the lungs after sharp exercise. When the bronchial murmur is heard over  other portions of the lungs, it may signify that the lungs are more or  less solidified by disease and the blowing bronchial murmur is  transmitted through this solid lung to the ear from a distant part of  the chest. The bronchial murmur in an abnormal place signifies that  there exists pneumonia or that the lungs are compressed by fluid in the  chest cavity.    Additional sounds are heard in the lungs in some diseased conditions.  For example, when fluid collects in the air passages and the air is  forced through it or is caused to pass through tubes containing  secretions or pus. Such sounds are of a gurgling or bubbling nature and  are known as mucous rales. Mucous rales are spoken of as being large or  small as they are distinct or indistinct, depending upon the quantity of  fluid that is present and the size of the tube in which this sound is  produced. Mucous rales occur in pneumonia after the solidified parts  begin to break down at the end of the disease. They occur in bronchitis  and in tuberculosis, where there is an excess of secretion.    Sometimes a shrill sound is heard, like the note of a whistle, fife, or  flute. This is due to a dry constriction of the bronchial tubes and it  is heard in chronic bronchitis and in tuberculosis.    A friction sound is heard in pleurisy. This is due to the rubbing  together of roughened surfaces, and the sound produced is similar to a  dry rubbing sound that is caused by rubbing the hands together or by  rubbing upon each other two dry, rough pieces of leather.      THE EXAMINATION OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT.    The first point in connection with the examination of the organs of  digestion is the appetite and the manner of taking food and drink. A  healthy animal has a good appetite. Loss of appetite does not point to a  special diseased condition, but comes from a variety of causes. Some of  these causes, indeed, may be looked upon as being physiological.  Excitement, strange surroundings, fatigue, and hot weather may all cause  loss of appetite. Where there is cerebral depression, fever, profound  weakness, disorder of the stomach, or mechanical difficulty in chewing  or swallowing, the appetite is diminished or destroyed. Sometimes there  is an appetite or desire to eat abnormal things, such as dirty bedding,  roots of grass, soil, etc. This desire usually comes from a chronic  disturbance of nutrition.    Thirst is diminished in a good many mild diseases unaccompanied by  distinct fever. It is seen where there is great exhaustion or depression  or profound brain disturbance. Thirst is increased after profuse  sweating, in diabetes, diarrhea, in fever, at the crises of infectious  diseases, and when the mouth is dry and hot.    Some diseases of the mouth or throat make it difficult for the horse to  chew or swallow his feed. Where difficulty in this respect is  experienced, the following named conditions should be borne in mind and  carefully looked for: Diseases of the teeth, consisting in decay,  fracture, abscess formation, or overgrowth; inflammatory conditions, or  wounds or tumors of the tongue, cheeks, or lips; paralysis of the  muscles of chewing or swallowing; foreign bodies in upper part of the  mouth between the molar teeth; inflammation of throat. Difficulty in  swallowing is sometimes shown by the symptom known as \"quidding.\"  Quidding consists in dropping from the mouth well-chewed and insalivated  boluses of feed. A mouthful of hay, for example, after being ground and  masticated, is carried to the back part of the mouth. The horse then  finds that from tenderness of the throat, or from some other cause,  swallowing is difficult or painful, and the bolus is then dropped from  the mouth. Another quantity of hay is similarly prepared, only to be  dropped in turn. Sometimes quidding is due to a painful tooth, the bolus  being dropped from the mouth when the tooth is struck and during the  pang that follows. Quidding may be practiced so persistently that a  considerable pile of boluses of feed accumulate in the manger or on the  floor of the stall. In pharyngitis one of the symptoms is a return  through the nose of fluid that the horse attempts to swallow.    In some brain diseases, and particularly in chronic internal  hydrocephalus, the horse has a most peculiar manner of swallowing and of  taking feed. A similar condition is seen in hyperemia of the brain. In  eating the horse will sink his muzzle into the grain in the feed box  and eat for a while without raising the head. Long pauses are made while  the feed is in the mouth. Sometimes the horse will eat very rapidly for  a little while and then slowly; the jaws may be brought together so  forcibly that the teeth gnash. In eating hay the horse will stop at  times with hay protruding from the mouth and stand stupidly, as though  he has forgotten what he was about.    In examining the mouth one should first look for swellings or for  evidence of abnormal conditions upon the exterior; that is, the front  and sides of the face, the jaws, and about the muzzle. By this means  wounds, fractures, tumors, abscesses, and disease accompanied by  eruptions about the muzzle may be detected. The interior of the mouth is  examined by holding the head up and inserting the fingers through the  interdental space in such a way as to cause the mouth to open. The  mucous membrane should be clean and of a light-pink color, excepting on  the back of the tongue, where the color is a yellowish gray. As  abnormalities of this region, the chief are diffuse inflammation,  characterized by redness and catarrhal discharge; local inflammation, as  from eruptions, ulcers, or wounds; necrosis of the lower jawbone in  front of the first back tooth; and swellings. Foreign bodies are  sometimes found embedded in the mucous membrane lining of the mouth or  lodged between the teeth.    The examination of the pharynx and of the esophagus is made chiefly by  pressing upon the skin covering these organs in the region of the throat  and along the left side of the neck in the jugular gutter. Sometimes,  when a more careful examination is necessary, an esophageal tube or  probang is passed through the nose or mouth down the esophagus to the  stomach.    Vomiting is an act consisting in the expulsion of all or part of the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2343"],[0,"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge (#5)"],[1,"the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to follow it.  Simple as it has been in its leading features, it has none the less  presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest.  There are  gaps in that direction which we have still to fill.    \"We will go back to the note which was handed in to Garcia upon the  evening of his death.  We may put aside this idea of Baynes's that  Garcia's servants were concerned in the matter.  The proof of this lies  in the fact that it was _he_ who had arranged for the presence of Scott  Eccles, which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi.  It was Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and apparently a criminal  enterprise, in hand that night in the course of which he met his death.  I say 'criminal' because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires  to establish an alibi. Who, then, is most likely to have taken his  life?  Surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was  directed.  So far it seems to me that we are on safe ground.    \"We can now see a reason for the disappearance of Garcia's household.  They were _all_ confederates in the same unknown crime. If it came off  when Garcia returned, any possible suspicion would be warded off by the  Englishman's evidence, and all would be well.  But the attempt was a  dangerous one, and if Garcia did _not_ return by a certain hour it was  probable that his own life had been sacrificed.  It had been arranged,  therefore, that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for  some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a  position afterwards to renew their attempt.  That would fully explain  the facts, would it not?\"    The whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me. I  wondered, as I always did, how it had not been obvious to me before.    \"But why should one servant return?\"    \"We can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious,  something which he could not bear to part with, had been left behind.  That would explain his persistence, would it not?\"    \"Well, what is the next step?\"    \"The next step is the note received by Garcia at the dinner.  It  indicates a confederate at the other end.  Now, where was the other  end?  I have already shown you that it could only lie in some large  house, and that the number of large houses is limited. My first days in  this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the  intervals of my botanical researches I made a reconnaissance of all the  large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants.  One house, and only one, riveted my attention.  It is the famous old  Jacobean grange of High Gable, one mile on the farther side of Oxshott,  and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy.  The other  mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof  from romance.  But Mr. Henderson, of High Gable, was by all accounts a  curious man to whom curious adventures might befall. I concentrated my  attention, therefore, upon him and his household.    \"A singular set of people, Watson--the man himself the most singular of  them all.  I managed to see him on a plausible pretext, but I seemed to  read in his dark, deepset, brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of  my true business.  He is a man of fifty, strong, active, with iron-gray  hair, great bunched black eyebrows, the step of a deer and the air of  an emperor--a fierce, masterful man, with a red-hot spirit behind his  parchment face. He is either a foreigner or has lived long in the  tropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but tough as whipcord.  His  friend and secretary, Mr. Lucas, is undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate  brown, wily, suave, and catlike, with a poisonous gentleness of speech.  You see, Watson, we have come already upon two sets of foreigners--one  at Wisteria Lodge and one at High Gable--so our gaps are beginning to  close.    \"These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the  household; but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose  may be even more important.  Henderson has two children--girls of  eleven and thirteen.  Their governess is a Miss Burnet, an Englishwoman  of forty or thereabouts.  There is also one confidential manservant.  This little group forms the real family, for they travel about  together, and Henderson is a great traveller, always on the move.  It  is only within the last weeks that he has returned, after a year's  absence, to High Gable.  I may add that he is enormously rich, and  whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them.  For the  rest, his house is full of butlers, footmen, maidservants, and the  usual overfed, underworked staff of a large English country house.    \"So much I learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own  observation.  There are no better instruments than discharged servants  with a grievance, and I was lucky enough to find one.  I call it luck,  but it would not have come my way had I not been looking out for it.  As Baynes remarks, we all have our systems. It was my system which  enabled me to find John Warner, late gardener of High Gable, sacked in  a moment of temper by his imperious employer.  He in turn had friends  among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their  master.  So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment.    \"Curious people, Watson!  I don't pretend to understand it all yet, but  very curious people anyway.  It's a double-winged house, and the  servants live on one side, the family on the other. There's no link  between the two save for Henderson's own servant, who serves the  family's meals.  Everything is carried to a certain door, which forms  the one connection.  Governess and children hardly go out at all,  except into the garden.  Henderson never by any chance walks alone.  His dark secretary is like his shadow.  The gossip among the servants  is that their master is terribly afraid of something.  'Sold his soul  to the devil in exchange for money,' says Warner, 'and expects his  creditor to come up and claim his own.'  Where they came from, or who  they are, nobody has an idea.  They are very violent.  Twice Henderson  has lashed at folk with his dog-whip, and only his long purse and heavy  compensation have kept him out of the courts.    \"Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new information.  We may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and  was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt which had already  been planned. Who wrote the note? It was someone within the citadel,  and it was a woman.  Who then but Miss Burnet, the governess?  All our  reasoning seems to point that way.  At any rate, we may take it as a  hypothesis and see what consequences it would entail.  I may add that  Miss Burnet's age and character make it certain that my first idea that  there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question.    \"If she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of  Garcia.  What, then, might she be expected to do if she heard of his  death?  If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be  sealed.  Still, in her heart, she must retain bitterness and hatred  against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as  she could to have revenge upon them.  Could we see her, then and try to  use her?  That was my first thought.  But now we come to a sinister  fact.  Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night  of the murder.  From that evening she has utterly vanished.  Is she  alive?  Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend  whom she had summoned?  Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point  which we still have to decide.    \"You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. There is  nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant.  Our whole scheme might  seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The woman's disappearance  counts for nothing, since in that extraordinary household any member of  it might be invisible for a week.  And yet she may at the present  moment be in danger of her life.  All I can do is to watch the house  and leave my agent, Warner, on guard at the gates.  We can't let such a  situation continue.  If the law can do nothing we must take the risk  ourselves.\"    \"What do you suggest?\"    \"I know which is her room.  It is accessible from the top of an  outhouse.  My suggestion is that you and I go to-night and see if we  can strike at the very heart of the mystery.\"    It was not, I must confess, a very alluring prospect.  The old house  with its atmosphere of murder, the singular and formidable inhabitants,  the unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact that we were putting  ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour.  But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of Holmes which made  it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend.  One knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution be found.  I  clasped his hand in silence, and the die was cast.    But it was not destined that our investigation should have so  adventurous an ending.  It was about five o'clock, and the shadows of  the March evening were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic rushed  into our room.    \"They've gone, Mr. Holmes.  They went by the last train.  The lady  broke away, and I've got her in a cab downstairs.\"    \"Excellent, Warner!\" cried Holmes, springing to his feet. \"Watson, the  gaps are closing rapidly.\"    In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She  bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent  tragedy.  Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised  it and turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark  dots in the centre of the broad gray iris.  She was drugged with opium.    \"I watched at the gate, same"]]]
