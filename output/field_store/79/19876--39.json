But of all my treasures the last is the king,      For there's very few children possess such a thing;      And that is a chisel, both handle and blade,      Which a man who was really a carpenter made.    [Illustration]          BLOCK CITY          What are you able to build with your blocks?      Castles and palaces, temples and docks.      Rain may keep raining, and others go roam,      But I can be happy and building at home.        Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,      There I'll establish a city for me:      A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,      And a harbour as well where my vessels may ride.        Great is the palace with pillar and wall,      A sort of a tower on the top of it all,      And steps coming down in an orderly way      To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.        This one is sailing and that one is moored:      Hark to the song of the sailors on board!      And see, on the steps of my palace, the kings      Coming and going with presents and things!        Now I have done with it, down let it go!      All in a moment the town is laid low.      Block upon block lying scattered and free,      What is there left of my town by the sea?        Yet as I saw it, I see it again,      The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men,      And as long as I live and where'er I may be,      I'll always remember my town by the sea.    [Illustration]          THE LAND OF STORY-BOOKS          At evening when the lamp is lit,      Around the fire my parents sit;      They sit at home and talk and sing,      And do not play at anything.        Now, with my little gun, I crawl      All in the dark along the wall,      And follow round the forest track      Away behind the sofa back.        There, in the night, where none can spy,      All in my hunter's camp I lie,      And play at books that I have read      Till it is time to go to bed.        These are the hills, these are the woods,      These are my starry solitudes;      And there the river by whose brink      The roaring lions come to drink.        I see the others far away      As if in firelit camp they lay,      And I, like to an Indian scout,      Around their party prowled about.        So, when my nurse comes in for me,      Home I return across the sea,      And go to bed with backward looks      At my dear land of Story-books.    [Illustration]          ARMIES IN THE FIRE          The lamps now glitter down the street;      Faintly sound the falling feet;      And the blue even slowly falls      About the garden trees and walls.        Now in the falling of the gloom      The red fire paints the empty room:      And warmly on the roof it looks,      And flickers on the backs of books.        Armies march by tower and spire      Of cities blazing, in the fire;--      Till as I gaze with staring eyes,      The armies fade, the lustre dies.        Then once again the glow returns;      Again the phantom city burns;      And down the red-hot valley, lo!      The phantom armies marching go!        Blinking embers, tell me true      Where are those armies marching to,      And what the burning city is      That crumbles in your furnaces!    [Illustration]          THE LITTLE LAND          When at home alone I sit,      And am very tired of it,      I have just to shut my eyes      To go sailing through the skies--      To go sailing far away      To the pleasant Land of Play;      To the fairy land afar      Where the Little People are;      Where the clover-tops are trees,      And the rain-pools are the seas,      And the leaves, like little ships,      Sail about on tiny trips;      And above the daisy tree        Through the grasses,      High o'erhead the Bumble Bee        Hums and passes.        In that forest to and fro      I can wander, I can go;      See the spider and the fly,      And the ants go marching by,      Carrying parcels with their feet      Down the green and grassy street.      I can in the sorrel sit      Where the ladybird alit.      I can climb the jointed grass        And on high      See the greater swallows pass        In the sky,      And the round sun rolling by      Heeding no such things as I.        Through that forest I can pass      Till, as in a looking-glass,      Humming fly and daisy tree      And my tiny self I see,      Painted very clear and neat      On the rain-pool at my feet.      Should a leaflet come to land      Drifting near to where I stand,      Straight I'll board that tiny boat      Round the rain-pool sea to float.        Little thoughtful creatures sit      On the grassy coasts of it;      Little things with lovely eyes      See me sailing with surprise.      Some are clad in armour green--      (These have sure to battle been!)--      Some are pied with ev'ry hue,      Black and crimson, gold and blue;      Some have wings and swift are gone;--      But they all look kindly on.        [Illustration: THE LITTLE LAND]          When my eyes I once again        Open, and see all things plain:      High bare walls, great bare floor;      Great big knobs on drawer and door;      Great big people perched on chairs,      Stitching tucks and mending tears,      Each a hill that I could climb,      And talking nonsense all the time--        O dear me,        That I could be      A sailor on the rain-pool sea,      A climber in the clover tree,      And just come back, a sleepy-head,      Late at night to go to bed.          GARDEN DAYS    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          NIGHT AND DAY          When the golden day is done,        Through the closing portal,      Child and garden, flower and sun,        Vanish all things mortal.        As the blinding shadows fall        As the rays diminish,      Under evening's cloak, they all        Roll away and vanish.        Garden darkened, daisy shut,        Child in bed, they slumber--      Glow-worm in the highway rut,        Mice among the lumber.        In the darkness houses shine,        Parents move with candles;      Till on all, the night divine        Turns the bedroom handles.        Till at last the day begins        In the east a-breaking,      In the hedges and the whins        Sleeping birds a-waking.        In the darkness shapes of things,        Houses, trees and hedges,      Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings        Beat on window ledges.        These shall wake the yawning maid;        She the door shall open--      Finding dew on garden glade        And the morning broken.        There my garden grows again        Green and rosy painted,      As at eve behind the pane        From my eyes it fainted.        Just as it was shut away,        Toy-like, in the even,      Here I see it glow with day        Under glowing heaven.        Every path and every plot,        Every bush of roses,      Every blue forget-me-not        Where the dew reposes.        \"Up!\" they cry, \"the day is come        On the smiling valleys:      We have beat the morning drum;        Playmate, join your allies!\"    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          NEST EGGS          Birds all the sunny day        Flutter and quarrel      Here in the arbour-like        Tent of the laurel.        Here in the fork        The brown nest is seated;      Four little blue eggs        The mother keeps heated.        While we stand watching her        Staring like gabies,      Safe in each egg are the        Bird's little babies.        Soon the frail eggs they shall        Chip, and upspringing      Make all the April woods        Merry with singing.        Younger than we are,        O children, and frailer,      Soon in blue air they'll be,        Singer and sailor.        We, so much older,        Taller and stronger,      We shall look down on the        Birdies no longer.        They shall go flying        With musical speeches      High over head in the        Tops of the beeches.        In spite of our wisdom        And sensible talking,      We on our feet must go        Plodding and walking.    [Illustration]          THE FLOWERS          All the names I know from nurse:      Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,      Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,      And the Lady Hollyhock.        Fairy places, fairy things,      Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,      Tiny trees for tiny dames--      These must all be fairy names!        Tiny woods below whose boughs      Shady fairies weave a house;      Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,      Where the braver fairies climb!    [Illustration: THE FLOWERS]        Fair are grown-up people's trees,      But the fairest woods are these;      Where, if I were not so tall,      I should live for good and all.          SUMMER SUN          Great is the sun, and wide he goes      Through empty heaven without repose;      And in the blue and glowing days      More thick than rain he showers his rays.        Though closer still the blinds we pull      To keep the shady parlour cool,      Yet he will find a chink or two      To slip his golden fingers through.        The dusty attic spider-clad      He, through the keyhole, maketh glad;      And through the broken edge of tiles      Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.        Meantime his golden face around      He bares to all the garden ground,      And sheds a warm and glittering look      Among the ivy's inmost nook.        Above the hills, along the blue,      Round the bright air with footing true,      To please the child, to paint the rose,      The gardener of the World, he goes.    [Illustration]          THE DUMB SOLDIER          When the grass was closely mown,      Walking on the lawn alone,      In the turf a hole I found,      And hid a soldier underground.        Spring and daisies came apace;      Grasses hide my hiding place;      Grasses run like a green sea      O'er the lawn up to my knee.        Under grass alone he lies,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2562"],[0,"The Clouds (#5)"],[1," than a drachma every month for torches;       so that also all, when they went out of an evening, were       wont to say, \"Boy, don't buy a torch, for the moonlight       is beautiful.\" And she says she confers other benefits       on you, but that you do not observe the days at all       correctly, but confuse them up and down; so that she       says the gods are constantly threatening her, when they       are defrauded of their dinner, and depart home, not       having met with the regular feast according to the       number of the days. And then, when you ought to be       sacrificing, you are inflicting tortures and litigating.       And often, while we gods are observing a fast, when we       mourn for Memnon or Sarpedon,  you are pouring libations       and laughing. For which reason Hyperbolus, having       obtained the lot this year to be Hieromnemon,  was       afterward deprived by us gods of his crown; for thus he       will know better that he ought to spend the days of his       life according to the Moon.         [Enter Socrates]         Soc. By Respiration, and Chaos, and Air, I have not seen       any man so boorish, nor so impracticable, nor so stupid,       nor so forgetful; who, while learning some little petty       quibbles, forgets them before he has learned them.       Nevertheless I will certainly call him out here to the       light. Where is Strepsiades? Come forth with your couch.         Strep. (from within). The bugs do not permit me to bring       it forth.         Soc. Make haste and lay it down; and give me your       attention.         [Enter Strepsiades]         Strep. Very well.         Soc. Come now; what do you now wish to learn first of       those things in none of which you have ever been       instructed? Tell me. About measures, or rhythms, or       verses?         Strep. I should prefer to learn about measures; for it       is but lately I was cheated out of two choenices  by a       meal-huckster.         Soc. I do not ask you this, but which you account the       most beautiful measure; the trimetre or the tetrameter?         Strep. Make a wager then with me, if the semisextarius       be not a tetrameter.         Soc. Go to the devil! How boorish you are and dull of       learning. Perhaps you may be able to learn about       rhythms.         Strep. But what good will rhythms do me for a living?         Soc. In the first place, to be clever at an       entertainment, understanding what rhythm is for the       war-dance, and what, again, according to the dactyle.         Strep. According to the dactyle? By Jove, but I know it!         Soc. Tell me, pray.         Strep. What else but this finger? Formerly, indeed, when       I was yet a boy, this here!         Soc. You are boorish and stupid.         Strep. For I do not desire, you wretch, to learn any of       these things.         Soc. What then?         Strep. That, that, the most unjust cause.         Soc. But you must learn other things before these;       namely, what quadrupeds are properly masculine.         Strep. I know the males, if I am not mad-krios, tragos,       tauros, kuon, alektryon.         Soc. Do you see what you are doing? You are calling both       the female and the male alektryon in the same way.         Strep. How, pray? Come, tell me.         Soc. How? The one with you is alektryon, and the other       is alektryon also.         Strep. Yea, by Neptune! How now ought I to call them?         Soc. The one alektryaina and the other alektor.         Strep. Alektryaina? Capital, by the Air! So that, in       return for this lesson alone, I will fill your kardopos       full of barley-meal on all sides.         Soc. See! See! There again is another blunder! You make       kardopos, which is feminine, to be masculine.         Strep. In what way do I make kardopos masculine?         Soc. Most assuredly; just as if you were to say       Cleonymos.         Strep. Good sir, Cleonymus had no kneading-trough, but       kneaded his bread in a round mortar. How ought I to call       it henceforth?         Soc. How? Call it kardope, as you call Sostrate.         Strep. Kardope in the feminine?         Soc. For so you speak it rightly.         Strep. But that would make it kardope, Kleonyme.         Soc. You must learn one thing more about names, what are       masculine and what of them are feminine.         Strep. I know what are female.         Soc. Tell me, pray.         Strep. Lysilla, Philinna, Clitagora, Demetria.         Soc. What names are masculine?         Strep. Thousands; Philoxenus, Melesias, Amynias.         Soc. But, you wretch! These are not masculine.         Strep. Are they not males with you?         Soc. By no means; for how would you call Amynias, if you       met him?         Strep. How would I call? Thus: \"Come hither, come hither       Amynia!\"         Soc. Do you see? You call Amynias a woman.         Strep. Is it not then with justice, who does not serve       in the army? But why should I learn these things, that       we all know?         Soc. It is no use, by Jupiter! Having reclined yourself       down here--         Strep. What must I do?         Soc. Think out some of your own affairs.         Strep. Not here, pray, I beseech you; but, if I must,       suffer me to excogitate these very things on the ground.         Soc. There is no other way.         [Exit Socrates.]         Strep. Unfortunate man that I am! What a penalty shall I       this day pay to the bugs!         Cho. Now meditate and examine closely; and roll yourself       about in every way, having wrapped yourself up; and       quickly, when you fall into a difficulty, spring to       another mental contrivance. But let delightful sleep be       absent from your eyes.         Strep. Attatai! Attatai!         Cho. What ails you? Why are you distressed?         Strep. Wretched man, I am perishing! The Corinthians,       coming out from the bed, are biting me, and devouring my       sides, and drinking up my life-blood, and tearing away       my flesh, and digging through my vitals, and will       annihilate me.         Cho. Do not now be very grievously distressed.         Strep. Why, how, when my money is gone, my complexion       gone, my life gone, and my slipper gone? And furthermore       in addition to these evils, with singing the       night-watches, I am almost gone myself.         [Re-enter Socrates]         Soc. Ho you! What are you about? Are you not meditating?         Strep. I? Yea, by Neptune!         Soc. And what, pray, have you thought?         Strep. Whether any bit of me will be left by the bugs.         Soc. You will perish most wretchedly.         Strep. But, my good friend, I have already perished.         Soc. You must not give in, but must wrap yourself up;       for you have to discover a device for abstracting, and a       means of cheating.         [Walks up and down while Strepsiades wraps himself up in       the blankets.]         Strep. Ah me! Would, pray, some one would throw over me       a swindling contrivance from the sheep-skins.         Soc. Come now; I will first see this fellow, what he is       about. Ho you! Are you asleep?         Strep. No, by Apollo, I am not!         Soc. Have you got anything?         Strep. No; by Jupiter, certainly not!         Soc. Nothing at all?         Strep. Nothing, except what I have in my right hand.         Soc. Will you not quickly cover yourself up and think of       something?         Strep. About what? For do you tell me this, O Socrates!         Soc. Do you, yourself, first find out and state what you       wish.         Strep. You have heard a thousand times what I wish.       About the interest; so that I may pay no one.         Soc. Come then, wrap yourself up, and having given your       mind play with subtilty, revolve your affairs by little       and little, rightly distinguishing and examining.         Strep. Ah me, unhappy man!         Soc. Keep quiet; and if you be puzzled in any one of       your conceptions, leave it and go; and then set your       mind in motion again, and lock it up.         Strep. (in great glee). O dearest little Socrates!         Soc. What, old man?         Strep. I have got a device for cheating them of the       interest.         Soc. Exhibit it.         Strep. Now tell me this, pray; if I were to purchase a       Thessalian witch, and draw down the moon by night,  and       then shut it up, as if it were a mirror, in a round       crest-case, and then carefully keep it--         Soc. What good, pray, would this do you?         Strep. What? If the moon were to rise no longer       anywhere, I should not pay the interest.         Soc. Why so, pray?         Strep. Because the money is lent out by the month.         Soc. Capital! But I will again propose to you another       clever question. If a suit of five talents should be       entered against you, tell me how you would obliterate       it.         Strep. How? How? I do not know but I must seek.         Soc. Do not then always revolve your thoughts about       yourself; but slack away your mind into the air, like a       cock-chafer  tied with a thread by the foot.         Strep. I have found a very clever method of getting rid       of my suit, so that you yourself would acknowledge it.         Soc. Of what description?         Strep. Have you ever seen this stone in the chemist's       shops, the beautiful and transparent one, from which       they kindle fire?         Soc. Do you mean the burning-glass?         Strep. I do. Come what would you say, pray, if I were to       take this, when the clerk was entering the suit, and       were to stand at a distance, in the direction of the       sun, thus, and melt out the letters of my suit?         Soc. Cleverly done, by the Graces!         Strep. Oh! How I am delighted, that a suit of five       talents has been cancelled!         Soc. Come now, quickly seize upon this.         Strep. What?"]]]
