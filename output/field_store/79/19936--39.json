[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#5)"],[1,"(Hr. x.) describes the notions of the Ebionites of Nabatha, Moabitis, and  Basanitis with regard to Adam and Jesus, almost in the very words of Sura  iii. 52. He tells us that they observed circumcision, were opposed to  celibacy, forbad turning to the sunrise, but enjoined Jerusalem as their  Kebla (as did Muhammad during twelve years), that they prescribed (as did the  Sabeites), washings, very similar to those enjoined in the Koran, and allowed  oaths (by certain natural objects, as clouds, signs of the Zodiac, oil, the  winds, etc.), which we find adopted in the Koran. These points of contact  with Islam, knowing as we do Muhammad's eclecticism, can hardly be  accidental.    We have no evidence that Muhammad had access to the Christian Scriptures,  though it is just possible that fragments of the Old or New Testament may  have reached him through Chadijah or Waraka, or other Meccan Christians,  possessing MSS. of the sacred volume. There is but one direct quotation (Sura  xxi. 105) in the whole Koran from the Scriptures; and though there are a few  passages, as where alms are said to be given to be seen of men, and as, none  forgiveth sins but God only, which might seem to be identical with texts of  the New Testament, yet this similarity is probably merely accidental. It is,  however, curious to compare such passages as Deut. xxvi. 14, 17; 1 Peter v.  2, with Sura xxiv. 50, p. 448, and x. 73, p. 281 John vii. 15, with the  \"illiterate\" Prophet-Matt. xxiv. 36, and John xii. 27, with the use of the  word hour as meaning any judgment or crisis, and The last judgment-the voice  of the Son of God which the dead are to hear, with the exterminating or  awakening cry of Gabriel, etc. The passages of this kind, with which the  Koran abounds, result from Muhammad's general acquaintance with Scriptural  phraseology, partly through the popular legends, partly from personal  intercourse with Jews and Christians. And we may be quite certain that  whatever materials Muhammad may have derived from our Scriptures, directly or  indirectly, were carefully recast. He did not even use its words without due  consideration. For instance, except in the phrase \"the Lord of the worlds,\"  he seems carefully to have avoided the expression the Lord, probably because  it was applied by the Christians to Christ, or to God the Father.    It should also be borne in mind that we have no traces of the existence of  Arabic versions of the Old or New Testament previous to the time of Muhammad.  The passage of St. Jerome-\"Hæc autem translatio nullum de veteribus sequitur  interpretem; sed ex ipso Hebraico, Arabicoque sermone, et interdum Syro, nunc  verba, nunc sensum, nunc simul utrumque resonabit,\" (Prol. Gal.) obviously  does not refer to versions, but to idiom. The earliest Ar. version of the Old  Testament, of which we have any knowledge, is that of R. Saadias Gaon, A.D.  900; and the oldest Ar. version of the New Testament, is that published by  Erpenius in 1616, and transcribed in the Thebais, in the year 1171, by a  Coptic Bishop, from a copy made by a person whose name is known, but whose  date is uncertain. Michaelis thinks that the Arabic versions of the New  Testament were made between the Saracen conquests in the seventh century, and  the Crusades in the eleventh century-an opinion in which he follows, or  coincides with, Walton (Prol. in Polygl. § xiv.) who remarks-\"Plane constat  versionem Arabicam apud eas (ecclesias orientales) factam esse postquam  lingua Arabica per victorias et religionem Muhammedanicam per Orientem  propagata fuerat, et in multis locis facta esset vernacula.\" If, indeed, in  these comparatively late versions, the general phraseology, especially in the  histories common to the Scriptures and to the Koran, bore any similarity to  each other, and if the orthography of the proper names had been the same in  each, it might have been fair to suppose that such versions had been made,  more or less, upon the basis of others, which, though now lost, existed in  the ages prior to Muhammad, and influenced, if they did not directly form,  his sources of information. But5 this does not appear to be the case. The  phraseology of our existing versions is not that of the Koran-and these  versions appear to have been made from the Septuagint, the Vulgate, Syriac,  Coptic, and Greek; the four Gospels, says Tischendorf6 originem mixtam habere  videntur.    From the Arab Jews, Muhammad would be enabled to derive an abundant, though  most distorted, knowledge of the Scripture histories. The secrecy in which he  received his instructions from them, and from his Christian informants,  enabled him boldly to declare to the ignorant pagan Meccans that God had  revealed those Biblical histories to him. But there can be no doubt, from the  constant identity between the Talmudic perversions of Scripture histories and  Rabbinic moral precepts, that the Rabbins of the Hejaz communicated their  legends to Muhammad. And it should be remembered that the Talmud was  completed a century previous to the era of Muhammad,7 and cannot fail to have  extensively influenced the religious creed of all the Jews of the Arabian  peninsula. In one passage,8 Muhammad speaks of an individual Jew-perhaps some  one of note among his professed followers, as a witness to his mission; and  there can be no doubt that his relations with the Jews were, at one time,  those of friendship and intimacy, when we find him speak of their recognising  him as they do their own children, and hear him blaming their most colloquial  expressions.9 It is impossible, however, for us at this distance of time to  penetrate the mystery in which this subject is involved. Yet certain it is,  that, although their testimony against Muhammad was speedily silenced, the  Koreisch knew enough of his private history to disbelieve and to disprove his  pretensions of being the recipient of a divine revelation, and that they  accused him of writing from the dictation of teachers morning and evening.10  And it is equally certain, that all the information received by Muhammad was  embellished and recast in his own mind and with his own words. There is a  unity of thought, a directness and simplicity of purpose, a peculiar and  laboured style, a uniformity of diction, coupled with a certain deficiency of  imaginative power, which proves the ayats (signs or verses) of the Koran at  least to be the product of a single pen. The longer narratives were,  probably, elaborated in his leisure hours, while the shorter verses, each  claiming to be a sign or miracle, were promulgated as occasion required them.  And, whatever Muhammad may himself profess in the Koran11 as to his  ignorance, even of reading and writing, and however strongly modern  Muhammadans may insist upon the same point an assertion by the way  contradicted by many good authors12-there can be no doubt that to assimilate  and work up his materials, to fashion them into elaborate Suras, to fit them  for public recital, must have been a work requiring much time, study, and  meditation, and presumes a far greater degree of general culture than any  orthodox Muslim will be disposed to admit.    In close connection with the above remarks, stands the question of Muhammad's  sincerity and honesty of purpose in coming forward as a messenger from God.  For if he was indeed the illiterate person the Muslims represent him to have  been, then it will be hard to escape their inference that the Koran is, as  they assert it to be, a standing miracle. But if, on the other hand, it was a  Book carefully concocted from various sources, and with much extraneous aid,  and published as a divine oracle, then it would seem that the author is at  once open to the charge of the grossest imposture, and even of impious  blasphemy. The evidence rather shews, that in all he did and wrote, Muhammad  was actuated by a sincere desire to deliver his countrymen from the grossness  of its debasing idolatries-that he was urged on by an intense desire to  proclaim that great truth of the Unity of the Godhead which had taken full  possession of his own soul-that the end to be attained justified to his mind  the means he adopted in the production of his Suras-that he worked himself up  into a belief that he had received a divine call-and that he was carried on  by the force of circumstances, and by gradually increasing successes, to  believe himself the accredited messenger of Heaven. The earnestness of those  convictions which at Mecca sustained him under persecution, and which perhaps  led him, at any price as it were, and by any means, not even excluding deceit  and falsehood, to endeavour to rescue his countrymen from idolatry,-naturally  stiffened at Medina into tyranny and unscrupulous violence. At the same time,  he was probably, more or less, throughout his whole career, the victim of a  certain amount of self-deception. A cataleptic13 subject from his early  youth, born-according to the traditions-of a highly nervous and excitable  mother, he would be peculiarly liable to morbid and fantastic hallucinations,  and alternations of excitement and depression, which would win for him, in  the eyes of his ignorant countrymen, the credit of being inspired. It would  be easy for him to persuade himself that he was \"the seal of the Prophets,\"  the proclaimer of a doctrine of the Divine Unity, held and taught by the  Patriarchs, especially by Abraham-a doctrine that should present to mankind  Judaism divested of its Mosaic ceremonial, and Christianity divested of the  Atonement and the Trinity14-doctrine, as he might have believed, fitted and  destined to absorb Judaism, Christianity, and Idolatry; and this persuasion,  once admitted into his mind as a conviction, retained possession of it, and  carried him on, though often in the use of means, towards the end of his  career, far different from those with which he commenced it, to a victorious  consummation. It is true"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28019"],[0,"Birds in the Bush (#5)"],[1,"in.    But avoiding \"genealogies and contentions,\" and taking up the question  with which we began, we may safely say that birds sing, sometimes to  gratify an innate love for sweet sounds; sometimes to win a mate, or to  tell their love to a mate already won; sometimes as practice, with a  view to self-improvement; and sometimes for no better reason than the  poet's,--\"I do but sing because I must.\" In general, they sing for joy;  and their joy, of course, has various causes.    For one thing, they are very sensitive to the weather. With them, as  with us, sunlight and a genial warmth go to produce serenity. A bright  summer-like day, late in October, or even in November, will set the  smaller birds to singing, and the grouse to drumming. I heard a robin  venturing a little song on the 25th of last December; but that, for  aught I know, was a Christmas carol. No matter what the season, you will  not hear a great deal of bird music during a high wind; and if you are  caught in the woods by a sudden shower in May or June, and are not too  much taken up with thoughts of your own condition, you will hardly fail  to notice the instant silence which falls upon the woods with the rain.  Birds, however, are more or less inconsistent (that is, a part of their  likeness to us), and sometimes sing most freely when the sky is  overcast.    But their highest joys are by no means dependent upon the moods of the  weather. A comfortable state of mind is not to be contemned, but beings  who are capable of deep and passionate affection recognize a difference  between comfort and ecstasy. And the peculiar glory of birds is just  here, in the all-consuming fervor of their love. It would be commonplace  to call them models of conjugal and parental faithfulness. With a few  exceptions (and these, it is a pleasure to add, not singers), the very  least of them is literally faithful unto death. Here and there, in the  notes of some collector, we are told of a difficulty he has had in  securing a coveted specimen: the tiny creature, whose mate had been  already \"collected,\" would persist in hovering so closely about the  invader's head that it was impossible to shoot him without spoiling him  for the cabinet by blowing him to pieces!    Need there be any mystery about the singing of such a lover? Is it  surprising if at times he is so enraptured that he can no longer sit  tamely on the branch, but must dart into the air, and go circling round  and round, caroling as he flies?    So far as song is the voice of emotion, it will of necessity vary with  the emotion; and every one who has ears must have heard once in a while  bird music of quite unusual fervor. For example, I have often seen the  least flycatcher (a very unromantic-looking body, surely) when he was  almost beside himself; flying in a circle, and repeating breathlessly  his emphatic _chebec_. And once I found a wood pewee in a somewhat  similar mood. He was more quiet than the least flycatcher; but he too  sang on the wing, and I have never heard notes which seemed more  expressive of happiness. Many of them were entirely new and strange,  although the familiar _pewee_ was introduced among the rest. As I  listened, I felt it to be an occasion for thankfulness that the  delighted creature had never studied anatomy, and did not know that the  structure of his throat made it improper for him to sing. In this  connection, also, I recall a cardinal grosbeak, whom I heard several  years ago, on the bank of the Potomac River. An old soldier had taken me  to visit the Great Falls, and as we were clambering over the rocks this  grosbeak began to sing; and soon, without any hint from me, and without  knowing who the invisible musician was, my companion remarked upon the  uncommon beauty of the song. The cardinal is always a great singer,  having a voice which, as European writers say, is almost equal to the  nightingale's; but in this case the more stirring, martial quality of  the strain had given place to an exquisite mellowness, as if it were,  what I have no doubt it was, a song of love.    Every kind of bird has notes of its own, so that a thoroughly practiced  ear would be able to discriminate the different species with nearly as  much certainty as Professor Baird would feel after an examination of the  anatomy and plumage. Still this strong specific resemblance is far from  being a dead uniformity. Aside from the fact, already mentioned, that  the characteristic strain is sometimes given with extraordinary  sweetness and emphasis, there are often to be detected variations of a  more formal character. This is noticeably true of robins. It may almost  be said that no two of them sing alike; while now and then their  vagaries are conspicuous enough to attract general attention. One who  was my neighbor last year interjected into his song a series of four or  five most exact imitations of the peep of a chicken. When I first heard  this performance, I was in company with two friends, both of whom  noticed and laughed at it; and some days afterwards I visited the spot  again, and found the bird still rehearsing the same ridiculous medley. I  conjectured that he had been brought up near a hen-coop, and, moreover,  had been so unfortunate as to lose his father before his notes had  become thoroughly fixed; and then, being compelled to finish his musical  education by himself, had taken a fancy to practice these chicken calls.  This guess may not have been correct. All I can affirm is that he sang  exactly as he might have been expected to do, on that supposition; but  certainly the resemblance seemed too close to be accidental.    The variations of the wood thrush are fully as striking as those of the  robin, and sometimes it is impossible not to feel that the artist is  making a deliberate effort to do something out of the ordinary course,  something better than he has ever done before. Now and then he prefaces  his proper song with many disconnected, extremely _staccato_ notes,  following each other at very distant and unexpected intervals of pitch.  It is this, I conclude, which is meant by some writer (who it is I  cannot now remember) when he criticises the wood thrush for spending too  much time in tuning his instrument. But the fault is the critic's, I  think; to my ear these preliminaries sound rather like the recitative  which goes before the grand _aria_.    Still another musician who delights to take liberties with his score is  the towhee bunting, or chewink. Indeed, he carries the matter so far  that sometimes it seems almost as if he suspected the proximity of some  self-conceited ornithologist, and were determined, if possible, to make  a fool of him. And for my part, being neither self conceited nor an  ornithologist, I am willing to confess that I have once or twice been so  badly deceived that now the mere sight of this _Pipilo_ is, so to speak,  a means of grace to me.    One more of these innovators (these heretics, as they are most likely  called by their more conservative brethren) is the field sparrow,  better known as _Spizella pusilla_. His usual song consists of a simple  line of notes, beginning leisurely, but growing shorter and more rapid  to the close. The voice is so smooth and sweet, and the acceleration so  well managed, that, although the whole is commonly a strict monotone,  the effect is not in the least monotonous. This song I once heard  rendered in reverse order, with a result so strange that I did not  suspect the identity of the author till I had crept up within sight of  him. Another of these sparrows, who has passed the last two seasons in  my neighborhood, habitually doubles the measure; going through it in the  usual way, and then, just as you expect him to conclude, catching it up  again, _Da capo_.    But birds like these are quite outdone by such species as the song  sparrow, the white-eyed vireo, and the Western meadow-lark,--species of  which we may say that each individual bird has a whole repertory of  songs at his command. The song sparrow, who is the best known of the  three, will repeat one melody perhaps a dozen times, then change it for  a second, and in turn leave that for a third; as if he were singing  hymns of twelve or fifteen stanzas each, and set each hymn to its  appropriate tune. It is something well worth listening to, common  though it is, and may easily suggest a number of questions about the  origin and meaning of bird music.    The white-eyed vireo is a singer of astonishing spirit, and his sudden  changes from one theme to another are sometimes almost startling. He is  a skillful ventriloquist, also, and I remember one in particular who  outwitted me completely. He was rehearsing a well-known strain, but at  the end there came up from the bushes underneath a querulous call. At  first I took it for granted that some other bird was in the underbrush;  but the note was repeated too many times, and came in too exactly on the  beat.    I have no personal acquaintance with the Western meadow-lark, but no  less than twenty-six of his songs have been printed in musical notation,  and these are said to be by no means all.[4]    Others of our birds have similar gifts, though no others, so far as I  know, are quite so versatile as these three. Several of the warblers,  for example, have attained to more than one set song, notwithstanding  the deservedly small reputation of this misnamed family. I have myself  heard the golden-crowned thrush, the black-throated green warbler, the  black-throated blue, the yellow-rumped, and the chestnut-sided, sing  two melodies each, while the blue golden-winged has at least three; and  this, of course, without making anything of slight variations such as  all birds are more or less accustomed to indulge in. The best of the  three songs of the blue golden-wing I have never heard except on one  occasion, but then it was repeated for half an hour under my very eyes.  It bore no resemblance"]]]
