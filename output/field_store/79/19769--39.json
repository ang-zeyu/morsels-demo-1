He had high notions of his own worth: he would  stalk into the cottages of the settlers, seat himself with great  dignity: his followers, to the number of one or two hundred, patiently  awaiting his signal to approach.    As the influence of Musquito enlarged, it became more pernicious. He not  only misled his immediate followers, but propagated his spirit. Deeds of  great enormity were committed at his direction; several by his own hand.  He drew a man from his house at Pittwater, by the _cooey_, and then  speared him to death. A servant of Mr. Cassidy, and another of Mr.  Evans, met a similar fate. In concert with Tom, a Tasmanian black, he  became a terror to the colony. Their parties moved in large bodies, and  acted under a common impulse. In carrying on their depredations, their  tactics aimed at military unity and skill. A party of sixty appeared  before the premises of Mr. Hobbs, at the Eastern Marshes (1824): they  watched the servants deliver their fire, and before they could reload  their muskets, they rushed upon them, and by weight of numbers drove  them off the ground. A few days after, the natives again appeared: a  small party came forward first, and reconnoitred; then returning to a  hill, they made signals to a body of a hundred and fifty, in an opposite  direction. Both divisions bore down on the establishment. The English  were now well armed, and maintained the post for five hours; but escaped  when they saw the natives prepare to surround the dwelling with fire.  Overcome with terror, for several days they refused to return, and the  property was left to its fate. Mr. Hobbs was specially unfortunate: his  house lay in the track, both of the natives and bushrangers, and thrice  in one season his premises were pillaged.    The arrest of Musquito became an object of importance, and Colonel  Arthur, then Governor, offered a reward for his capture. Teague, an  aboriginal boy, brought up by Dr. Luttrel, was dispatched with two  constables. They overtook Musquito at Oyster Bay: he resisted, but was  shot in the groin, and being unarmed was captured, with two women, and  conveyed to Hobart town.    It was resolved to bring him to justice. By the care of Dr. Scott he was  cured, and transferred from the hospital to gaol. Black Tom was  subsequently taken, and both were tried for the murder of William  Holyhoak and Patrick M'Arthur. Of the last of these offences the  Tasmanian was found guilty, but Musquito was convicted of both.    Marmoa, an Otaheitian, was killed with Holyhoak: Musquito had lingered  in their neighbourhood, and watched their movements for days; he had  visited their hut, and received provisions from their hands; but on the  morning of the murder he purloined the guns and removed the dogs. Mamoa  fell instantly; but the Englishman endured the misery of long pursuit  and several wounds, and dropped at last, pierced through and through  with spears.    A murder, ascribed to black Tom, for which he was not put on trial,  displayed extraordinary perfidy. This black went to the residence of Mr.  Osborne, of Jericho, demanding bread. His appearance excited great  alarm: Mrs. Osborne was there alone; he, however, left her uninjured.  Next morning her husband ran into the house, exclaiming, \"the hill is  covered with savages.\" He stood at the door on guard, and endeavoured to  soothe them. \"What do you want--are you hungry?\" \"Yes, white man,\" said  Tom. Mrs. Osborne requested them to put down their spears. Tom  consented, if the gun were laid aside: this was done. On returning the  second time with food, Osborne missed his musket, and then said, \"I am a  dead man.\" Two blacks came forward, and, as if in friendship, each took  him by the hand. At that moment, a savage behind him thrust a spear  through his back; he uttered a loud shriek, sprang convulsively forward,  and fell dead!    Such were the men who, in February, 1825, suffered death with six  European criminals. They were unassisted by counsel, and perhaps the  evidence was not fully understood by them. It is useless, however, to  extenuate their treachery: and their execution, whether politic or not,  can scarcely be accounted unjust. But, unhappily, these deeds of  barbarity were not left to the vengeance of the law. The colonists, of  higher grades, preserved the distinction between the guilty and the  innocent, which it is the object of public trials to establish; but the  lower orders, and especially the dissolute and the worthless, justified  hatred to the race, and finally, systematic massacre by the individual  acts of such men as Musquito.    It is instructive, if not amusing, to observe how nicely the theory of  some philosophers and the sentiments of the lowest European robbers,  meet together; how, what one predicts, the other executes. The supposed  eternal laws of nature are accomplished by the wild license of an  English savage. It became the serious conviction of stockmen, that  blacks are brutes, only of a more cunning and dangerous order--an  impression which has long ceased in this colony, but which still  flourishes in Australia Felix.    Bent, the proprietor of the only newspaper published at that time,  referring to the outrages of the hostile blacks, seemed to dread these  doctrines. With great consideration he detaches Musquito's guilt from  the tribes in general: a distinction by no means trite or universally  recognised. \"Until corrupted by the Sydney natives they were,\" he  asserts, \"the most peaceable race in existence.\" These suggestions  deserve more praise than the highest literary skill.    The disposition to conciliate the blacks eventually contributed to the  same disastrous consequences. A tribe, of sixty, appeared in Hobart  Town, November, 1824: they came in a peaceable manner, their visit was  unexpected, and its cause unknown. On the first notice of their  approach, the Governor went forth to meet them: he assigned three places  for their fires, supplied them with food and blankets, and appointed  constables to protect them. They departed suddenly, and on their journey  attempted to spear a white man. Whether the abrupt retreat resulted  from caprice or distrust, it did not prevent a similar visit to  Launceston in the following December. There were 200 in this party. When  crossing Patterson's Plains they were wantonly fired on by the whites,  and in their return some of their women were treated with indescribable  brutality.[7] When they reached the Lake River, two sawyers, who had  never before suffered molestation, were wounded by their spears. The  recent cruelty they had experienced fully accounted for their rage.    It was the anxious desire of the Governor to establish a native  institution, deriving its funds partly from the public purse and partly  from private benevolence. A code was prepared by the Rev. Messrs.  Bedford and Mansfield; and a public meeting held in the church of St.  David, the Governor presiding, approved the regulations; but at that  time the colony was distracted by the ravages of robbers, and its  financial resources were depressed: and the prevailing opinion that  civilisation was impossible, still further embarrassed the project, and  confined the hopes of the most sanguine to the rising generation. Mr.  Mansfield rested his expectation rather on the power of God than upon  human probabilities.    The civilisation of a barbarous people is, perhaps, impossible, in the  presence of organised communities of white men. The contrast is too  great, and the points of contact too numerous and irritating. Never have  colonists civilised aborigines; but the failure is easily explained,  without recourse to egotistical superstition, that the white man's  shadow is, to men of every other hue, by law of Heaven, the shadow of  death.    The children of aborigines, adopted by the whites, when they grew to  maturity, were drawn to the woods, and resumed the habits of their  kindred. A black girl, trained in Launceston, thus allured, laid aside  her clothing, which she had worn nearly from infancy. It was thus with  many: a sense of inferiority to the youth about them, united with the  mysterious interest which every heart feels in kindred sympathies, is  sufficient to account for these relapses. Examples will crowd upon the  memory of the reader, in which the polish and caresses of the British  capital did not disqualify the savage to re-enter with zest on the  barbarous pursuits of his forefathers.    The desire for sugar, bread, and blankets, could only be regularly  gratified by an abandonment of migratory habits.    When remote from the government stores, the natives still coveted what  they could not obtain, but as spoil. They had learned to prefer articles  of steel to the crystal, and they acquired an imperfect mastery of  fire-arms. Some were, however, exceedingly expert; a chief, conciliated  by Robinson, brought down an eagle hawk, with all the airs of a  practised sportsman. Thus their untutored nature could not resist the  temptation created by new wants: they watched the hut of the  stock-keeper, which they stripped during his absence; till, growing more  daring, they disregarded his presence; and even the populous districts,  and establishments of considerable force, were not safe from their  depredations.    At the time when they first became formidable, armed bushrangers scoured  the colony; sometimes the allies of the natives, much oftener their  oppressors.[8] Outlaws themselves, they inculcated the arts of violence.  The improved caution and cunning of the natives, so often noticed by the  government, were ascribed, in no small degree, to the treacherous  lessons of degraded Europeans. But when the bushranger did not employ  these people as the instrument of his designs, by fear or cruelty, often  he destroyed them: thus Lemon and Brown set up the natives as marks to  fire at. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#5)"],[1," however, does  not convince me; I rather suspect that RV. IV. xxvi. 1 and 4, with  their mention of Manu, to whom the soma was brought, are echoes of an  ancient and true tradition that Indra was once a mortal.]    [Footnote 8: The other legend in MS. II. i. 12, that Aditi bound the  unborn Indra with an iron fetter, with which he was born, and of which  he was able to rid himself by means of a sacrifice, is probably  later.]    [Footnote 9: E.g. AB. VII. xxxi., VIII. xii. Cf. BA. Up. I. iv.  11-13.]    [Footnote 10: AB. VIII. xiv. (Keith's translation).]    [Footnote 11: Cf. Sayana on RV. I. xciii. 5.]    These bits of saga prove, as effectually as is possible in a case like  this, that Indra was originally a warrior-king or chieftain who was  deified, perhaps by the priestly tribe of the Angirasas, who claim in  some of the hymns to have aided him in his fight with Vritra, and that  he thus rose to the first rank in the pantheon, gathering round  himself a great cycle of heroic legend based upon those traditions,  and only secondarily and by artificial invention becoming associated  with the control of the rain and the daylight.    The name Asvina means \"The Two Horsemen\"; what their other name,  Nasatya, signifies nobody has satisfactorily explained. But even with  the name Asvina there is a difficulty. They are described usually as  riding together in a chariot which is sometimes said to be drawn by  horses, and this would suit their name; but more often the poets say  that their chariot is drawn by birds, such as eagles or swans, and  sometimes even by a buffalo or buffaloes, or by an ass. I do not see  how we can escape from this difficulty except by supposing that  popular imagination in regard to this matter varied from very early  times, but preferred to think of them as having horses. At any rate  they are very ancient gods, for the people of Iran also have  traditions about them, and in the far-away land of the Mitanni, in the  north of Mesopotamia, they are invoked together with Indra, Mitra, and  Varuna to sanction treaties. In India the Aryans keep them very busy,  for they are more than anything else gods of help. Thrice every day  and thrice every night they sally forth on their patrols through earth  and heaven, in order to aid the distressed[12]: and the poets tell us  the names of many persons whom they have relieved, such as old  Chyavana, whom they restored to youth and love, Bhujyu, whom they  rescued from drowning in the ocean, Atri, whom they saved from a fiery  pit, Vispala, to whom when her leg had been cut off they gave one of  iron, and Ghosha, to whom they brought a husband. Many other helpful  acts are ascribed to them, and it is very likely that at least some of  these stories are more or less true. Another legend relates that they  jointly wedded Surya, the daughter of the Sun-god, who chose them from  amongst the other gods.[13]    [Footnote 12: Cf. _Ved. Studien_, ii. p. 31, RV. I. xxxiv. 2.]    [Footnote 13: Cf. _Ved. Studien_, i. p. 14 ff.]    Amidst the medley of saga and facts and poetical imagination which  surrounds the Asvina, can we see the outlines of their original  character? It is hard to say: opinions must differ. The Aryans of  India are inclined to say that they are simply divine kings active in  good works; but the priests are perhaps beginning to fancy that they  may be embodiments of powers of nature--they are not sure which--and  in course of time they will have various theories, partly connected  with their rituals. But really all that is certain in the Vedic age  about the Asvins is that they are an ancient pair of saviour-gods who  ride about in a chariot and render constant services to mankind. We  are tempted however to see a likeness between them and the [Greek:  Dios koro] of the distant Hellenes, the heroes Kastor and Polydeukes,  Castor and Pollux, the twin Horsemen who are saviours of afflicted  mankind by land and sea. There are difficulties in the way of this  theory; but they are not unsurmountable, and I believe that the  Asvina of India have the same origin as the Twin Horsemen of Greece.  At any rate both the pairs are hero-gods, whose divinity has been  created by mankind's need for help and admiration for valour. Whether  there was any human history at the back of this process we cannot say.    Now we may leave the heroes and consider a god of a very different  kind, Vishnu.    The Rig-veda has not very much to say about Vishnu, and what it says  is puzzling. The poets figure him as a beneficent young giant, of  unknown parentage, with two characteristic attributes: the first of  these is his three mystic strides, the second his close association  with Indra. Very often they refer to these three strides, sometimes  using the verb _vi-kram_, \"to step out,\" sometimes the adjectives  _uru-krama_, \"widely-stepping,\" and _uru-gaya_, \"wide-going.\" The  three steps carry Vishnu across the three divisions of the universe,  in the highest of which is his home, which apparently he shares with  Indra (RV. I. xxxii. 20, cliv. 5-6, III. lv. 10; cf. AB. I. i., etc.).  Some of them are beginning to imagine that these steps symbolise the  passage of the sun through the three divisions of the world, the  earth, sky, and upper heaven; certainly this idea will be held by many  later scholars, though a few will maintain that it denotes the sun at  its rising, at midday, and at its setting. Before long we shall find  some priests harping on the same notion in another form, saying that  Vishnu's head was cut off by accident and became the sun; and later on  we shall see Vishnu bearing as one of his weapons a chakra, or discus,  which looks like a figure of the sun. But really all this is an  afterthought: in the Veda, and the priestly literature that follows  directly upon the Veda, Vishnu is _not_ the sun. Nor do we learn what  he is very readily from his second leading attribute in the Rig-veda,  his association with Indra. Yet it is a very clearly marked trait in  his character. Not only do the poets often couple the two gods in  prayer and praise, but they often tell us that the one performed his  characteristic deeds by the help of the other. They say that Vishnu  made his three strides by the power of Indra (VIII. xii. 27), or for  the sake of Indra (Val. iv. 3), and even that Indra strode along with  Vishnu (VI. lxix. 5, VII. xcix. 6), and on the other hand they tell us  often that it was by the aid of Vishnu that Indra overcame Vritra and  other malignant foes. \"Friend Vishnu, stride out lustily,\" cries Indra  before he can strike down Vritra (IV. xviii. 11).[14] The answer to  this riddle I find in the Brahmanas, the priestly literature which is  about to follow immediately after the Veda. In plain unequivocal words  the Brahmanas tell us again and again that _Vishnu is the  sacrifice_.[15] Evidently when they repeat this they are repeating an  old hieratic tradition; and it is one which perfectly explains the  facts of the case. Vishnu, I conceive, was originally nothing more or  less than the embodied spirit of the sacrificial rites. His name seems  to be derived from the root _vish_, meaning stimulation or  inspiration; and this is exactly what the sacrifice is supposed in  priestly theory to do. The sacrifice, accompanied by prayer and  praise, is imagined to have a magic power of its own, by which the  gods worshipped in it are strengthened to perform their divine  functions. One poet says to Indra: \"When thy two wandering Bays thou  dravest hither, thy praiser laid within thine arms the thunder\" (RV.  I. lxiii. 2); and still more boldly another says: \"Sacrifice, Indra,  made thee wax so mighty ... worship helped thy bolt when slaying the  dragon\" (III. xxxii. 12). So it would be very natural for the priests  to conceive this spirit of the sacrificial rites as a personal deity;  and this deity, the Brahmanas assure us, is Vishnu. Then the idea of  the three strides and the association with Indra would easily grow up  in the priestly imagination. The inspiring power of the sacrifice is  supposed to pervade the three realms of the universe, earth, sky, and  upper heavens; this idea is expressed in the common ritual formula  _bhur bhuvas svah_, and is symbolised by three steps taken by the  priest in certain ceremonies, which are translated into the language  of myth as the three strides of Vishnu.[16] Observe that in the  Rig-veda the upper heaven is not the dwelling-place of Vishnu only;  Agni the Fire-god, Indra and Soma have their home in it also (RV. I.  cliv. 6, IV. xxvi. 6, xxvii. 3-4, V. iii. 3, VIII. lxxxix. 8, IX.  lxiii. 27, lxvi. 30, lxviii. 6, lxxvii. 2, lxxxvi. 24, X. i. 3, xi. 4,  xcix. 8, cxliv. 4). Later, however, when their adventitious divinity  begins to fade away from Agni and Soma, and Indra is allotted a  special paradise of his own, this \"highest step\" will be regarded as  peculiar to Vishnu, _Vishnoh paramam padam_.    [Footnote 14: A later and distorted version of this myth appears in  AB. VI. xv.]    [Footnote 15: E.g. MS. 1. iv. 14, SB. I. i. 1, 2, 13, TB. I. ii. 5, 1,  AB. I. xv., KB. IV. ii., XVIII. viii., xiv.]    [Footnote 16: SB. I. ix. 3, 8-11. Cf. the three steps of the  Amesha-spentas from the earth to the sun, imitated in the Avestic  ritual (Avesta, transl. Darmesteter, I. 401).]    As soon as this spirit of sacrifice was thus personified, he at once  attached himself to Indra; for Indra is pre-eminently the god of  action, and for his activities he needs to be stimulated by sacrifice  and praise. As the priests will tell us in plain unvarnished words,  \"he to whom the Sacrifice comes as portion slays Indra\" (AB. I. iv.).  Therefore we are told that Vishnu aids Indra in his heroic exploits,  that Vishnu takes his strides and presses Soma in order that Indra may  be strengthened for his tasks. Now we can see the full meaning of  Indra's cry before striking Vritra, \"Friend Vishnu, stride out  lustily!\"; for until "]]]
