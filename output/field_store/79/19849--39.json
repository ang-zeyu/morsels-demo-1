How Rama entered Dandak wood  And in Sutikhna's presence stood.  The favour Anasuya showed,  The wondrous balsam she bestowed.  How Sarabhanga's dwelling-place  They sought; saw Indra face to face;  The meeting with Agastya gained;  The heavenly bow from him obtained.  How Rama with Viradha met;  Their home in Panchavata set.  How Surpanakha underwent  The mockery and disfigurement.  Of Trisira's and Khara's fall,  Of Ravan roused at vengeance call,  Maricha doomed, without escape;  The fair Videhan(55) lady's rape.  How Rama wept and raved in vain,  And how the Vulture-king was slain.  How Rama fierce Kabandha slew;  Then to the side of Pampa drew,  Met Hanuman, and her whose vows  Were kept beneath the greenwood boughs.  How Raghu's son, the lofty-souled,  On Pampa's bank wept uncontrolled,  Then journeyed, Rishyamuk to reach,  And of Sugriva then had speech.  The friendship made, which both had sought:  How Bali and Sugriva fought.  How Bali in the strife was slain,  And how Sugriva came to reign.  The treaty, Tara's wild lament;  The rainy nights in watching spent.  The wrath of Raghu's lion son;  The gathering of the hosts in one.  The sending of the spies about,  And all the regions pointed out.  The ring by Rama's hand bestowed;  The cave wherein the bear abode.  The fast proposed, their lives to end;  Sampati gained to be their friend.  The scaling of the hill, the leap  Of Hanuman across the deep.  Ocean's command that bade them seek  Mainaka of the lofty peak.  The death of Sinhika, the sight  Of Lanka with her palace bright  How Hanuman stole in at eve;  His plan the giants to deceive.  How through the square he made his way  To chambers where the women lay,  Within the Asoka garden came  And there found Rama's captive dame.  His colloquy with her he sought,  And giving of the ring he brought.  How Sita gave a gem o'erjoyed;  How Hanuman the grove destroyed.  How giantesses trembling fled,  And servant fiends were smitten dead.  How Hanuman was seized; their ire  When Lanka blazed with hostile fire.  His leap across the sea once more;  The eating of the honey store.  How Rama he consoled, and how  He showed the gem from Sita's brow.  With Ocean, Rama's interview;  The bridge that Nala o'er it threw.  The crossing, and the sitting down  At night round Lanka's royal town.  The treaty with Vibhishan made:  The plan for Ravan's slaughter laid.  How Kumbhakarna in his pride  And Meghanada fought and died.  How Ravan in the fight was slain,  And captive Sita brought again.  Vibhishan set upon the throne;  The flying chariot Pushpak shown.  How Brahma and the Gods appeared,  And Sita's doubted honour cleared.  How in the flying car they rode  To Bharadvaja's cabin abode.  The Wind-God's son sent on afar;  How Bharat met the flying car.  How Rama then was king ordained;  The legions their discharge obtained.  How Rama cast his queen away;  How grew the people's love each day.  Thus did the saint Valmiki tell  Whate'er in Rama's life befell,  And in the closing verses all  That yet to come will once befall.          Canto IV. The Rhapsodists.      When to the end the tale was brought,  Rose in the sage's mind the thought;  \"Now who throughout this earth will go,  And tell it forth that all may know?\"  As thus he mused with anxious breast,  Behold, in hermit's raiment dressed,  Kusa and Lava(56) came to greet  Their master and embrace his feet.  The twins he saw, that princely pair  Sweet-voiced, who dwelt beside him there  None for the task could be more fit,  For skilled were they in Holy Writ;  And so the great Ramayan, fraught  With lore divine, to these he taught:  The lay whose verses sweet and clear  Take with delight the listening ear,  That tell of Sita's noble life  And Ravan's fall in battle strife.  Great joy to all who hear they bring,  Sweet to recite and sweet to sing.  For music's sevenfold notes are there,  And triple measure,(57) wrought with care  With melody and tone and time,  And flavours(58) that enhance the rime;  Heroic might has ample place,  And loathing of the false and base,  With anger, mirth, and terror, blent  With tenderness, surprise, content.  When, half the hermit's grace to gain,  And half because they loved the strain,  The youth within their hearts had stored  The poem that his lips outpoured,  Valmiki kissed them on the head,  As at his feet they bowed, and said;  \"Recite ye this heroic song  In tranquil shades where sages throng:  Recite it where the good resort,  In lowly home and royal court.\"      The hermit ceased. The tuneful pair,  Like heavenly minstrels sweet and fair,  In music's art divinely skilled,  Their saintly master's word fulfilled.  Like Rama's self, from whom they came,  They showed their sire in face and frame,  As though from some fair sculptured stone  Two selfsame images had grown.  Sometimes the pair rose up to sing,  Surrounded by a holy ring,  Where seated on the grass had met  Full many a musing anchoret.  Then tears bedimmed those gentle eyes,  As transport took them and surprise,  And as they listened every one  Cried in delight, Well done! Well done!  Those sages versed in holy lore  Praised the sweet minstrels more and more:  And wondered at the singers' skill,  And the bard's verses sweeter still,  Which laid so clear before the eye  The glorious deeds of days gone by.  Thus by the virtuous hermits praised,  Inspirited their voice they raised.  Pleased with the song this holy man  Would give the youths a water-can;  One gave a fair ascetic dress,  Or sweet fruit from the wilderness.  One saint a black-deer's hide would bring,  And one a sacrificial string:  One, a clay pitcher from his hoard,  And one, a twisted munja cord.(59)  One in his joy an axe would find,  One braid, their plaited locks to bind.  One gave a sacrificial cup,  One rope to tie their fagots up;  While fuel at their feet was laid,  Or hermit's stool of fig-tree made.  All gave, or if they gave not, none  Forgot at least a benison.  Some saints, delighted with their lays,  Would promise health and length of days;  Others with surest words would add  Some boon to make their spirit glad.  In such degree of honour then  That song was held by holy men:  That living song which life can give,  By which shall many a minstrel live.  In seat of kings, in crowded hall,  They sang the poem, praised of all.  And Rama chanced to hear their lay,  While he the votive steed(60) would slay,  And sent fit messengers to bring  The minstrel pair before the king.  They came, and found the monarch high  Enthroned in gold, his brothers nigh;  While many a minister below,  And noble, sate in lengthened row.  The youthful pair awhile he viewed  Graceful in modest attitude,  And then in words like these addressed  His brother Lakshman and the rest:  \"Come, listen to the wondrous strain  Recited by these godlike twain,  Sweet singers of a story fraught  With melody and lofty thought.\"      The pair, with voices sweet and strong,  Rolled the full tide of noble song,  With tone and accent deftly blent  To suit the changing argument.  Mid that assembly loud and clear  Rang forth that lay so sweet to hear,  That universal rapture stole  Through each man's frame and heart and soul.  \"These minstrels, blest with every sign  That marks a high and princely line,    In holy shades who dwell,  Enshrined in Saint Valmiki's lay,  A monument to live for aye,    My deeds in song shall tell.\"  Thus Rama spoke: their breasts were fired,  And the great tale, as if inspired,    The youths began to sing,  While every heart with transport swelled,  And mute and rapt attention held    The concourse and the king.          Canto V. Ayodhya.        \"Ikshvaku's sons from days of old  Were ever brave and mighty-souled.  The land their arms had made their own  Was bounded by the sea alone.  Their holy works have won them praise,  Through countless years, from Manu's days.  Their ancient sire was Sagar, he  Whose high command dug out the sea:(61)  With sixty thousand sons to throng  Around him as he marched along.  From them this glorious tale proceeds:  The great Ramayan tells their deeds.  This noble song whose lines contain  Lessons of duty, love, and gain,  We two will now at length recite,  While good men listen with delight.      On Sarju's(62) bank, of ample size,  The happy realm of Kosal lies,  With fertile length of fair champaign  And flocks and herds and wealth of grain.  There, famous in her old renown,  Ayodhya(63) stands, the royal town,  In bygone ages built and planned  By sainted Manu's(64) princely hand.  Imperial seat! her walls extend  Twelve measured leagues from end to end,  And three in width from side to side,  With square and palace beautified.  Her gates at even distance stand;  Her ample roads are wisely planned.  Right glorious is her royal street  Where streams allay the dust and heat.  On level ground in even row  Her houses rise in goodly show:  Terrace and palace, arch and gate  The queenly city decorate.  High are her ramparts, strong and vast,  By ways at even distance passed,  With circling moat, both deep and wide,  And store of weapons fortified.      King Dasaratha, lofty-souled,  That city guarded and controlled,  With towering Sal trees belted round,(65)  And many a grove and pleasure ground,  As royal Indra, throned on high,  Rules his fair city in the sky.(66)  She seems a painted city, fair  With chess-board line and even square.(67)  And cool boughs shade the lovely lake  Where weary men their thirst may slake.  There gilded chariots gleam and shine,  And stately piles the Gods enshrine.  There gay sleek people ever throng  To festival and dance and song.  A mine is she of gems and sheen,  The darling home of Fortune's Queen.  With noblest sort of drink and meat,  The fairest rice and golden wheat,  And fragrant with the chaplet's scent  With holy oil and incense blent.  With many an elephant and steed,  And wains for draught and cars for speed.

Never knew the difference till Ned Slocum went and told him. He's  always doing things like that.\"    Keith had collected his books and now marched his brothers and sisters  off to school. Left alone with the baby, Mrs. Grant betook herself to  her work with a heavy heart. But a second interruption broke the  progress of her dish-washing.    \"I declare,\" she said, with a surprised glance through the window, \"if  there isn't that absent-minded schoolteacher coming through the yard!  What can he want? Dear me, I do hope Teddy hasn't been cutting capers  in school again.\"    For the teacher's last call had been in October and had been  occasioned by the fact that the irrepressible Teddy would persist in  going to school with his pockets filled with live crickets and in  driving them harnessed to strings up and down the aisle when the  teacher's back was turned. All mild methods of punishment having  failed, the teacher had called to talk it over with Mrs. Grant, with  the happy result that Teddy's behaviour had improved--in the matter of  crickets at least.    But it was about time for another outbreak. Teddy had been unnaturally  good for too long a time. Poor Mrs. Grant feared that it was the calm  before a storm, and it was with nervous haste that she went to the  door and greeted the young teacher.    He was a slight, pale, boyish-looking fellow, with an abstracted,  musing look in his large dark eyes. Mrs. Grant noticed with amusement  that he wore a white straw hat in spite of the season. His eyes were  directed to her face with his usual unseeing gaze.    \"Just as though he was looking through me at something a thousand  miles away,\" said Mrs. Grant afterwards. \"I believe he was, too. His  body was right there on the step before me, but where his soul was is  more than you or I or anybody can tell.\"    \"Good morning,\" he said absently. \"I have just called on my way to  school with a message from Miss Millar. She wants you all to come up  and have Christmas dinner with her tomorrow.\"    \"For the land's sake!\" said Mrs. Grant blankly. \"I don't understand.\"  To herself she thought, \"I wish I dared take him and shake him to find  if he's walking in his sleep or not.\"    \"You and all the children--every one,\" went on the teacher dreamily,  as if he were reciting a lesson learned beforehand. \"She told me to  tell you to be sure and come. Shall I say that you will?\"    \"Oh, yes, that is--I suppose--I don't know,\" said Mrs. Grant  incoherently. \"I never expected--yes, you may tell her we'll come,\"  she concluded abruptly.    \"Thank you,\" said the abstracted messenger, gravely lifting his hat  and looking squarely through Mrs. Grant into unknown regions. When he  had gone Mrs. Grant went in and sat down, laughing in a sort of  hysterical way.    \"I wonder if it is all right. Could Cornelia really have told him? She  must, I suppose, but it is enough to take one's breath.\"    Mrs. Grant and Cornelia Millar were cousins, and had once been the  closest of friends, but that was years ago, before some spiteful  reports and ill-natured gossip had come between them, making only a  little rift at first that soon widened into a chasm of coldness and  alienation. Therefore this invitation surprised Mrs. Grant greatly.    Miss Cornelia was a maiden lady of certain years, with a comfortable  bank account and a handsome, old-fashioned house on the hill behind  the village. She always boarded the schoolteachers and looked after  them maternally; she was an active church worker and a tower of  strength to struggling ministers and their families.    \"If Cornelia has seen fit at last to hold out the hand of  reconciliation I'm glad enough to take it. Dear knows, I've wanted to  make up often enough, but I didn't think she ever would. We've both  of us got too much pride and stubbornness. It's the Turner blood in us  that does it. The Turners were all so set. But I mean to do my part  now she has done hers.\"    And Mrs. Grant made a final attack on the dishes with a beaming face.    When the little Grants came home and heard the news, Teddy stood on  his head to express his delight, the twins kissed each other, and Mary  Alice and Gordon danced around the kitchen.    Keith thought himself too big to betray any joy over a Christmas  dinner, but he whistled while doing the chores until the bare welkin  in the yard rang, and Teddy, in spite of unheard of misdemeanours, was  not collared off into the porch once.    When the young teacher got home from school that evening he found the  yellow house full of all sorts of delectable odours. Miss Cornelia  herself was concocting mince pies after the famous family recipe,  while her ancient and faithful handmaiden, Hannah, was straining into  moulds the cranberry jelly. The open pantry door revealed a tempting  array of Christmas delicacies.    \"Did you call and invite the Smithsons up to dinner as I told you?\"  asked Miss Cornelia anxiously.    \"Yes,\" was the dreamy response as he glided through the kitchen and  vanished into the hall.    Miss Cornelia crimped the edges of her pies delicately with a relieved  air. \"I made certain he'd forget it,\" she said. \"You just have to  watch him as if he were a mere child. Didn't I catch him yesterday  starting off to school in his carpet slippers? And in spite of me he  got away today in that ridiculous summer hat. You'd better set that  jelly in the out-pantry to cool, Hannah; it looks good. We'll give  those poor little Smithsons a feast for once in their lives if they  never get another.\"    At this juncture the hall door flew open and Mr. Palmer appeared on  the threshold. He seemed considerably agitated and for once his eyes  had lost their look of space-searching.    \"Miss Millar, I am afraid I did make a mistake this morning--it has  just dawned on me. I am almost sure that I called at Mrs. Grant's and  invited her and her family instead of the Smithsons. And she said they  would come.\"    Miss Cornelia's face was a study.    \"Mr. Palmer,\" she said, flourishing her crimping fork tragically, \"do  you mean to say you went and invited Linda Grant here tomorrow? Linda  Grant, of all women in this world!\"    \"I did,\" said the teacher with penitent wretchedness. \"It was very  careless of me--I am very sorry. What can I do? I'll go down and tell  them I made a mistake if you like.\"    \"You can't do that,\" groaned Miss Cornelia, sitting down and wrinkling  up her forehead in dire perplexity. \"It would never do in the world.  For pity's sake, let me think for a minute.\"    Miss Cornelia did think--to good purpose evidently, for her forehead  smoothed out as her meditations proceeded and her face brightened.  Then she got up briskly. \"Well, you've done it and no mistake. I don't  know that I'm sorry, either. Anyhow, we'll leave it as it is. But you  must go straight down now and invite the Smithsons too. And for pity's  sake, don't make any more mistakes.\"    When he had gone Miss Cornelia opened her heart to Hannah. \"I never  could have done it myself--never; the Turner is too strong in me. But  I'm glad it is done. I've been wanting for years to make up with  Linda. And now the chance has come, thanks to that blessed blundering  boy, I mean to make the most of it. Mind, Hannah, you never whisper a  word about its being a mistake. Linda must never know. Poor Linda!  She's had a hard time. Hannah, we must make some more pies, and I must  go straight down to the store and get some more Santa Claus stuff;  I've only got enough to go around the Smithsons.\"    When Mrs. Grant and her family arrived at the yellow house next  morning Miss Cornelia herself ran out bareheaded to meet them. The two  women shook hands a little stiffly and then a rill of long-repressed  affection trickled out from some secret spring in Miss Cornelia's  heart and she kissed her new-found old friend tenderly. Linda returned  the kiss warmly, and both felt that the old-time friendship was theirs  again.    The little Smithsons all came and they and the little Grants sat down  on the long bright dining room to a dinner that made history in their  small lives, and was eaten over again in happy dreams for months.    How those children did eat! And how beaming Miss Cornelia and  grim-faced, soft-hearted Hannah and even the absent-minded teacher  himself enjoyed watching them!    After dinner Miss Cornelia distributed among the delighted little  souls the presents she had bought for them, and then turned them loose  in the big shining kitchen to have a taffy pull--and they had it to  their hearts' content! And as for the shocking, taffyfied state into  which they got their own rosy faces and that once immaculate  domain--well, as Miss Cornelia and Hannah never said one word about  it, neither will I.    The four women enjoyed the afternoon in their own way, and the  schoolteacher buried himself in algebra to his own great satisfaction.    When her guests went home in the starlit December dusk, Miss Cornelia  walked part of the way with them and had a long confidential talk with  Mrs. Grant. When she returned it was to find Hannah groaning in and  over the kitchen and the schoolteacher dreamily trying to clean some  molasses off his boots with the kitchen hairbrush. Long-suffering Miss  Cornelia rescued her property and despatched Mr. Palmer into the  woodshed to find the shoe-brush. Then she sat down and laughed.    \"Hannah, what will become of that boy yet? There's no counting on what  he'll do next. I don't know how he'll ever get through the world, I'm  sure, but I'll look after him while he's here at least. I owe him a  huge debt of gratitude for this Christmas blunder. What an awful mess  this place is in! But, Hannah, did you ever in the world see anything  so delightful as that little Tommy Smithson stuffing himself with plum  cake, not to mention Teddy Grant? It did me good just to see them.\"          A Strayed"]]]
