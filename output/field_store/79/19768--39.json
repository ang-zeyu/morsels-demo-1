She visited Canterbury in August, A.D. 1538, and we are told  that she was taken to see the wonders of the place and marvelled at all  the riches thereof, and said \"that if she had not seen it, all the men in  the world could never 'a made her believe it.\" Though she would not kiss  the head of St. Thomas, the Prior \"did send her a present of coneys,  capons, chickens, with divers fruits--plenty--insomuch that she said,  'What shall we do with so many capons? Let the Lord Prior come, and eat,  and help us to eat them tomorrow at dinner' and so thanked him heartily  for the said present.\"    Such was the history of Becket's shrine. We have dwelt on it at some  length because it is no exaggeration to say that in the Middle Ages  Canterbury Cathedral owed its European fame and enormous riches to the  fact that it contained the shrine within its walls, and because the story  of the influence of the Saint and the miracles that he worked, and the  millions of pilgrims who flocked from the whole civilized world to do  homage to him, throws a brighter and more vivid light on the lives and  thoughts and beliefs of mediaeval men than many volumes stuffed with  historical research. No visitor to Canterbury can appreciate what he sees,  unless he realizes to some extent the glamour which overhung the resting  place of St. Thomas in the days of Geoffrey Chaucer. We have no certain  knowledge as to whether the other shrines and relics which enriched the  cathedral were destroyed along with those of St. Thomas. Dunstan and  Elphege at least can hardly have escaped, and it is probable that most of  the monuments and relics perished at the time of the Reformation. We know  that in A.D. 1541, Cranmer deplored the slight effect which had been  wrought by the royal orders for the destruction of the bones and images  of supposed saints. And that he forthwith received letters from the king,  enjoining him to cause \"due search to be made in his cathedral churches,  and if any shrine, covering of shrine, table, monument of miracles, or  other pilgrimage, do there continue, to cause it to be taken away, so as  there remain no memory of it.\" This order probably brought about the  destruction of the tombs and monuments of the early archbishops, most  of whom had been officially canonised, or been at least enrolled in the  popular calendar, and were accordingly doomed to have their resting-places  desecrated. We know that about this time the tomb of Winchelsey was  destroyed, because he was adored by the people as a reputed saint.    Any monuments that may have escaped royal vandalism at the Reformation  period, fell before the even more effective fanaticism of the Puritans,  who seem to have exercised their iconoclastic energies with especial zeal  and vigour at Canterbury. Just before their time Archbishop Laud spent a  good deal of trouble and money on the adornment of the high altar. A  letter to him from the Dean, dated July 8th, A.D. 1634, is quoted by  Prynne, \"We have obeyed your Grace's direction in pulling down the  exorbitant seates within our Quire whereby the church is very much  beautified.... Lastly wee most humbly beseech your Grace to take notice  that many and most necessary have beene the occasions of extraordinary  expences this yeare for ornaments, etc.\" And another Puritan scribe tells  us that \"At the east end of the cathedral they have placed an Altar as  they call it dressed after the Romish fashion, for which altar they have  lately provided a most idolatrous costly glory cloth or back cloth.\"    These embellishments were not destined to remain long undisturbed. In A.D.  1642, the Puritan troopers hewed the altar-rails to pieces and then \"threw  the Altar over and over down the three Altar steps, and left it lying with  the heels upwards.\" This was only the beginning: we read that during the  time of the Great Rebellion, \"the newly erected font was pulled down, the  inscriptions, figures, and coats of arms, engraven upon brass, were torn  off from the ancient monuments, and whatsoever there was of beauty or  decency in the holy place, was despoiled.\"    A manuscript, compiled in 1662, and preserved in the Chapter library,  gives a more minute account of this work of destruction. \"The windows  were generally battered and broken down; the whole roof, with that of the  steeples, the chapter-house and cloister, externally impaired and ruined  both in timber-work and lead; water-tanks, pipes, and much other lead cut  off; the choir stripped and robbed of her fair and goodly hangings; the  organ and organ-loft, communion-table, and the best and chiefest of the  furniture, with the rail before it, and the screen of tabernacle work  richly overlaid with gold behind it; goodly monuments shamefully abused,  defaced, and rifled of brasses, iron grates, and bars.\"    The ringleader in this work of destruction was a fanatic named Richard  Culmer, commonly known as Blue Dick. A paper preserved in the Chapter  library, in the writing of Somner, the great antiquarian scholar,  describes the state in which the fabric of the cathedral was left, at the  time of the Restoration of King Charles II., in 1660. \"So little,\" says  this document, \"had the fury of the late reformers left remaining of it  besides the bare walles and roofe, and these, partly through neglect, and  partly by the daily assaults and batteries of the disaffected, so  shattered, ruinated, and defaced, as it was not more unserviceable in the  way of a cathedral than justly scandalous to all who delight to serve God  in the beauty of Holines.\" Most of the windows had been broken, \"the  church's guardians, her faire and strong gates, turned off the hooks and  burned.\" The buildings and houses of the clergy had been pulled down or  greatly damaged; and lastly, \"the goodly oaks in our common gardens, of  good value in themselves, and in their time very beneficial to our church  by their shelter, quite eradicated and _set to sale_.\" This last touch is  interesting, as showing that the reforming zeal of the Puritans was not  always altogether disinterested.    After the Restoration some attempt was made to render the cathedral once  more a fitting place of worship, and the sum of L10,000 was devoted to  repairs and other public and pious uses. A screen was put up in the same  position as the former one, and the altar was placed in front. But, in  A.D. 1729, this screen no longer suited the taste of the period, and a  sum of L500, bequeathed by one of the prebendaries, was devoted to the  erection of a screen in the Corinthian style, designed by a certain Mr.  Burrough, afterwards Master of Caius College, Cambridge. A little before  this time the old stalls, which had survived the Puritan period were  replaced: a writer describes them, in the early half of the seventeenth  century, as standing in two rows, an upper and lower, on each side, with  the archbishop's wood throne above them on the south side. This chair he  mentions as \"sometime richly guilt, and otherwise well set forth, but now  nothing specious through age and late neglect. It is a close seat, made  after the old fashion of such stalls, called thence _faldistoria_; only in  this they differ, that they were moveable, this is fixt.\"    Thus wrote Somner in A.D. 1640: the dilapidated throne of which he speaks  was replaced, in A.D. 1704, by a splendid throne with a tall Corinthian  canopy, and decorated with carving by Grinling Gibbons, the gift of  Archbishop Tenison, who also set up new stalls. At the same time Queen  Mary the Second presented new and magnificent furniture for the altar,  throne, stalls of the chief clergy, and pulpit. Since then many alterations  have been made. The old altar and screen have been removed, and a new  reredos set up, copied from the screen work of the Lady Chapel in the  crypt; and Archbishop Tenison's throne has given place to a lofty stone  canopy. In 1834 owing to its tottering condition the north-west tower of  the nave had to be pulled down. It was rebuilt on an entirely different  plan by Mr. George Austin, who, with his son, also conducted a good deal  of repairing and other work in the cathedral and the buildings connected  with it. A good deal of the external stonework had to be renewed, but the  work was carried out judiciously, and only where it was absolutely  necessary. On the west side of the south transept a turret has been pulled  down and set up again stone by stone. The crypt has been cleared out and  restored, and its windows have been reopened. The least satisfactory  evidences of the modern hand are the stained glass windows, which have been  put up in the nave and transepts of the cathedral. The Puritan trooper had  wrought havoc in the ancient glass, smashing it wherever a pike-thrust  could reach; and modern piety has been almost as ruthless in erecting  windows which are quite incredibly hideous.    In September, 1872, Canterbury was once more damaged by fire, just about  seven hundred years after the memorable conflagration described by  Gervase. On this occasion, however, the damage did not go beyond the outer  roof of the Trinity Chapel. The fire broke out at about half-past ten in  the morning, and was luckily discovered before it had made much progress,  by two plumbers who were at work in the south gutter. According to the  \"Builder\" of that month, \"a peculiar whirring noise\" caused them to look  inside the roof, and they found three of the main roof-timbers blazing. \"The  best conjecture seems to be that the dry twigs, straw, and similar  _debris_, carried into the roof by birds, and which it has been the custom  to clear at intervals out of the vault pockets, had caught fire from a  spark that had in some way passed through the roof covering, perhaps under  a sheet raised a little at the bottom by the wind.\" Assistance was quickly  summoned, and \"by half-past"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#5)"],[1,"peculiarities,  were glad to see the Royal Analostan more contented and approachable.  They gave her more liberty after a week or two. They guarded her from  every menace. The Dogs were taught to respect her. No man or boy about  the place would have dreamed of throwing a stone at the famous  pedigreed Cat. She had all the food she wanted, but still she was not  happy. She was hankering for many things, she scarcely knew what. She  had everything--yes, but she wanted something else. Plenty to eat and  drink--yes, but milk does not taste the same when you can go and drink  all you want from a saucer; it has to be stolen out of a tin pail when  you are belly-pinched with hunger and thirst, or it does not have the  tang--it isn't milk.    Yes, there was a junk-yard back of the house and beside it and around  it too, a big one, but it was everywhere poisoned and polluted with  roses. The very Horses and Dogs had the wrong smells; the whole country  round was a repellent desert of lifeless, disgusting gardens and  hay-fields, without a single tenement or smoke-stack in sight. How she  did hate it all! There was only one sweet-smelling shrub in the whole  horrible place, and that was in a neglected corner. She did enjoy  nipping that and rolling in the leaves; it was a bright spot in the  grounds; but the only one, for she had not found a rotten fish-head nor  seen a genuine garbage-can since she came, and altogether it was the  most unlovely, unattractive, unsmellable spot she had ever known. She  would surely have gone that first night had she had the liberty. The  liberty was weeks in coming, and, meanwhile, her affinity with the cook  had developed as a bond to keep her; but one day after a summer of  discontent a succession of things happened to stir anew the slum  instinct of the royal prisoner.    A great bundle of stuff from the docks had reached the country mansion.  What it contained was of little moment, but it was rich with a score of  the most piquant and winsome of dock and slum smells. The chords of  memory surely dwell in the nose, and Pussy's past was conjured up with  dangerous force. Next day the cook 'left' through some trouble over  this very bundle. It was the cutting of cables, and that evening the  youngest boy of the house, a horrid little American with no proper  appreciation of royalty, was tying a tin to the blue-blooded one's  tail, doubtless in furtherance of some altruistic project, when Pussy  resented the liberty with a paw that wore five big fish-hooks for the  occasion. The howl of downtrodden America roused America's mother. The  deft and womanly blow that she aimed with her book was miraculously  avoided, and Pussy took flight, up-stairs, of course. A hunted Rat runs  down-stairs, a hunted Dog goes on the level, a hunted Cat runs up. She  hid in the garret, baffled discovery, and waited till night came. Then,  gliding down-stairs, she tried each screen-door in turn, till she found  one unlatched, and escaped into the black August night. Pitch-black to  man's eyes, it was simply gray to her, and she glided through the  disgusting shrubbery and flower-beds, took a final nip at that one  little bush that had been an attractive spot in the garden, and boldly  took her back track of the spring.    How could she take a back track that she never saw? There is in all  animals some sense of direction. It is very low in man and very high in  Horses, but Cats have a large gift, and this mysterious guide took her  westward, not clearly and definitely, but with a general impulse that  was made definite simply because the road was easy to travel. In an  hour she had covered two miles and reached the Hudson River. Her nose  had told her many times that the course was true. Smell after smell  came back, just as a man after walking a mile in a strange street may  not recall a single feature, but will remember, on seeing it again,  \"Why, yes, I saw that before.\" So Kitty's main guide was the sense of  direction, but it was her nose that kept reassuring her, \"Yes, now you  are right--we passed this place last spring.\"    At the river was the railroad. She could not go on the water; she must  go north or south. This was a case where her sense of direction was  clear; it said, \"Go south,\" and Kitty trotted down the foot-path  between the iron rails and the fence.          LIFE III    IX    Cats can go very fast up a tree or over a wall, but when it comes to  the long steady trot that reels off mile after mile, hour after hour,  it is not the cat-hop, but the dog-trot, that counts. Although the  travelling was good and the path direct, an hour had gone before two  more miles were put between her and the Hades of roses. She was tired  and a little foot-sore. She was thinking of rest when a Dog came  running to the fence near by, and broke out into such a horrible  barking close to her ear that Pussy leaped in terror. She ran as hard  as she could down the path, at the same time watching to see if the Dog  should succeed in passing the fence. No, not yet! but he ran close by  it, growling horribly, while Pussy skipped along on the safe side. The  barking of the Dog grew into a low rumble--a louder rumble and  roaring--a terrifying thunder. A light shone. Kitty glanced back to  see, not the Dog, but a huge Black Thing with a blazing red eye coming  on, yowling and spitting like a yard full of Cats. She put forth all  her powers to run, made such time as she had never made before, but  dared not leap the fence. She was running like a Dog, was flying, but  all in vain; the monstrous pursuer overtook her, but missed her in the  darkness, and hurried past to be lost in the night, while Kitty  crouched gasping for breath, half a mile nearer home since that Dog  began to bark.    This was her first encounter with the strange monster, strange to her  eyes only; her nose seemed to know him and told her this was another  landmark on the home trail. But Pussy lost much of her fear of his  kind. She learned that they were very stupid and could not find her if  she slipped quietly under a fence and lay still. Before morning she had  encountered several of them, but escaped unharmed from all.    About sunrise she reached a nice little slum on her home trail, and was  lucky enough to find several unsterilized eatables in an ash-heap. She  spent the day around a stable where were two Dogs and a number of small  boys, that between them came near ending her career. It was so very  like home; but she had no idea of staying there. She was driven by the  old craving, and next evening set out as before. She had seen the  one-eyed Thunder-rollers all day going by, and was getting used to  them, so travelled steadily all that night. The next day was spent in a  barn where she caught a Mouse, and the next night was like the last,  except that a Dog she encountered drove her backward on her trail for a  long way. Several times she was misled by angling roads, and wandered  far astray, but in time she wandered back again to her general  southward course. The days were passed in skulking under barns and  hiding from Dogs and small boys, and the nights in limping along the  track, for she was getting foot-sore; but on she went, mile after mile,  southward, ever southward--Dogs, boys, Roarers, hunger--Dogs, boys,  Roarers, hunger--yet on and onward still she went, and her nose from  time to time cheered her by confidently reporting, \"There surely is a  smell we passed last spring.\"      X    So a week went by, and Pussy, dirty, ribbon-less, foot-sore, and weary,  arrived at the Harlem Bridge. Though it was enveloped in delicious  smells, she did not like the look of that bridge. For half the night  she wandered up and down the shore without discovering any other means  of going south, excepting some other bridges, or anything of interest  except that here the men were as dangerous as the boys. Somehow she had  to come back to it; not only its smells were familiar, but from time to  time, when a One-eye ran over it, there was that peculiar rumbling roar  that was a sensation in the springtime trip. The calm of the late night  was abroad when she leaped to the timber stringer and glided out over  the water. She had got less than a third of the way across when a  thundering One-eye came roaring at her from the opposite end. She was  much frightened, but knowing their stupidity and blindness, she dropped  to a low side beam and there crouched in hiding. Of course the stupid  Monster missed her and passed on, and all would have been well, but it  turned back, or another just like it came suddenly spitting behind her.  Pussy leaped to the long track and made for the home shore. She might  have got there had not a third of the Red-eyed Terrors come screeching  at her from that side. She was running her hardest, but was caught  between two foes. There was nothing for it but a desperate leap from  the timbers into-she didn't know what. Down, down, down-plop, splash,  plunge into the deep water, not cold, for it was August, but oh, so  horrible! She spluttered and coughed when she came to the top, glanced  around to see if the Monsters were swimming after her, and struck out  for shore. She had never learned to swim, and yet she swam, for the  simple reason that a Cat's position and actions in swimming are the  same as her position and actions in walking. She had fallen into a  place she did not like; naturally she tried to walk out, and the result  was that she swam ashore. Which shore? The home-love never fails: the  south side was the only shore for her, the one nearest home. She  scrambled out all dripping wet, up the muddy bank and through  coal-piles and dust-heaps, looking as black, dirty, and unroyal as it  was possible for a Cat to look.    Once the shock was over, the Royal-pedigreed Slummer began to feel  better for the plunge. A genial glow without from the bath, a genial  sense of triumph within, for had she not"]]]
