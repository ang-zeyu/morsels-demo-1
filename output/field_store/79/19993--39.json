ALMOND HARDBAKE.      10 lbs. Good Brown Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    Lemon Flavoring if desired.    3 lbs. Almonds.    3 pints water.    PROCESS.--Split with a sharp knife the almonds, lay them face downwards  on an oiled plate, cover the plate as closely as possible; boil the  glucose, sugar and water to the crack 305; remove the pan from the fire,  and pour the contents carefully and evenly over the almonds; the  addition of a little lemon or almond flavoring will improve it.    N.B.--See remarks re-ladle in previous recipe.      ALMOND ROCK.      10 lbs. Brown Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    6 lbs. Sweet Almonds.    3 pints water.    PROCESS.--Clean your almonds by blowing out all the dust and grit, pick  out the shells, dissolve the sugar water and glucose; boil the lot up to  crack; pour the contents on oiled plate. Sprinkle the almond all over  the boil, shake over the lot a few drops of oil of lemon; turn up the  edges first, then the whole boil; mix and knead it like dough until all  the almonds are well mixed in; no time must be lost in this process or  the sugar will get too hard; when firm make a long roll of the entire  boil, place it on a hard wood board, and cut it up into thin slices; it  will have to be kept in shape while cutting, by turning over and  pressing the sides as it becomes flat; a special large sharp knife is  used for this purpose. A smaller boil than the above had better be tried  by beginners, say half the quantity. This can be done by halving the  ingredients. Needless to state these remarks apply to other recipes.      FRENCH ALMOND ROCK.      12 lbs. White Sugar.    3 lbs. Glucose.    6 lbs. Sweet Blanched Almonds.    4 pints water.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, water and glucose in the usual way to the  degree of weak crack, 305 by the thermometer, then ease the pan a little  way off the fire, and let the almonds gently slide into the mass. Use  the spatula a little just to keep the almonds from sticking to the  bottom, stirring lightly only the one way, then watch the boil carefully  till it turns a light golden color; lift off the pan and pour the  contents into the frames. The almond will come to the top better in tins  than in pouring plates.    Of course a better quality is made by adding more almonds, or vice  versa. The almond after being blanched should be spread on a tin and  dried, either on the stove top or in the oven.      RASPBERRY CANDY.      12 lbs. White Sugar.    3 lbs. Raspberry Jam.    2 quarts water.    Brilliant Rose Coloring.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in water, and boil to ball 250; add the  raspberry jam, and stir it well in; remove the pan from the fire, add  sufficient coloring to make bright raspberry; rub part of the mixture  with spatula against side of pan until it changes a heavy opaque, then  stir the whole mass until uniform. Pour the contents carefully on a  slab, covered with greased paper; make the sheet about 1/2 inch thick,  mark into bars with a sharp knife, and break up when cold.      APRICOT CANDY.      6 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Apricot Jam or Pulp.    2 pints water.    Saffron Coloring.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water and boil to ball, 250, add the jam  or pulp. Stir well until thoroughly mixed in, remove the pan, rub part  of the contents against the side of the pan with spatula until cloudy  and opaque; color with saffron a bright yellow, then stir the whole  together until uniform cloudy; pour out in frames or on slab covered  with oiled paper. A pinch of tartaric acid would improve the flavor, but  often prevent candying, unless in the hands of an expert. In any case  the acid should be added in a fine powder after the whole has been  thoroughly grained. A pallette knife is a very useful knife for rubbing  the sugar against the sides of the pan.      BROWN COCOANUT CANDY.      14 lbs. Brown Sugar.    6 large Cocoanuts Sliced.    3 pints water.    PROCESS.--Melt the sugar in the water, and boil to degree of ball, then  add the sliced cocoanut, stir them in remove the pan from the fire and  rub the sugar against the side of the pan until it becomes cloudy stir  the whole together until the whole becomes cloudy and thick; turn out  the batch into tins or on slabs; mark with a sharp knife into squares or  bars. When cold break it up at marks. Prepare the cocoanuts by cutting  them up into thin slices with a spokeshave or machine. The brown skin is  seldom skinned off for this dark candy.      WHITE COCOANUT CANDY.      14 lbs. White Sugar.    6 Large Cocoanuts Peeled and Sliced.    3 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Peel off all the brown skin from the nuts with a sharp knife;  wash them and cut into thin slices. Melt the sugar in the water and  boil to ball 250, add the sliced nuts, keeping the boil well stirred.  When thoroughly mixed, remove the pan from the fire and commence to  grain with pallette knife or spatula until the whole mass turns an  opaque white. Now turn out the batch into frames, or on the slab, which  has been covered with paper; mark into convenient sized bars, break up  when set hard.      CHOCOLATE COCOANUT CANDY.      10 lbs. Brown Sugar.    1 lb. Pure Block Cocoa.    4 Cocoanuts shredded.    3 pints water.    PROCESS.--When cracking the nuts, do so over a basin and save all the  milk: peel all brown skin off and cut the nut into fine shreds with  machine; dissolve the sugar in the pan with the water and cocoanut milk,  boil up to ball, remove the pan a little off the fire, then add the nut  together with the pure block cocoa, stir the whole together, grain on  side of pan as before directed. Stir the whole well up and turn out into  frames or on pouring plates.    N.B.--The pure cocoa should have been previously melted in a saucepan or  chopped up in small pieces. In the latter case there is less waste, and  the heat of the sugar would soon melt it.      FRUIT CANDY.      7 lbs. White or Brown Sugar.    1 lb. Currants cleaned and dried.    1/2 lb. Sultanas.    1/2 lb. Sweet Almonds.    2 pints water.    Saffron Coloring.    PROCESS.--Mix together the fruits, which should have been freed from  grit and dust; boil the sugar and water to the degree of ball, 250;  remove the pan from the fire; gently grain the boil by rubbing a little  of the syrup against the side of the pan until cloudy, then slide in the  fruit and stir the whole together, adding a little saffron to color a  bright yellow. See that the mass has changed to an opaque, then turn the  lot out into frames or on a pouring slab.      CANDIES, VARIOUS.    Fruits green, dried or preserved, almonds and nuts of almost every  description, as well as flavors and colors of a pleasant taste and  pretty hue may be used in making candies. The process is exactly the  same: the ingredients can be arranged to suit the fancy of the maker and  the palate of his customers. The field to select variety from seems  inexhaustible, so that new goods of this class should be introduced ad.  lib. No good purpose could be served by giving a procession of these  simple instructions, when with little thought and judgment anyone could  invent a new candy for themselves. It might be as well to add that a  little glucose or cream of tartar added will make the candies softer,  and may be used, if preferred, in each formula in the proportion of 2  lbs. of glucose or a teaspoonful of cream tartar to every 10 lbs. of  sugar.

White Sugar.    3 lbs. Glucose.    4 pints water.    1/4 oz. Oil Lemon.    Saffron Coloring.    PROCESS.--Put the sugar and water in a pan, place it on the fire, giving  it an occasional stir until the sugar is dissolved, then add the  glucose, or 1/4 oz. cream of tartar--either will do, but do not use  both--place the cover on the pan and let it boil for ten minutes or so,  (the cover is put on to steam the sides of the pan and keep it clean and  free from granulation); take off the cover and put in the thermometer,  immersing the bottom part in the boiling liquid. Let the whole boil  until it reaches the degree of crack, 300; tinge with saffron, then pour  the contents on pouring plate, which has been previously oiled; sprinkle  a few drops of oil of lemon over it, turn the edges as it begins to  cool: then turn it over, knead it up as soon as you can handle it: if it  is on a cool slab you must be pretty smart or it will get too hard. As  soon as it gets stiff enough cut off small convenient pieces and pass  through the barley sugar machine; when cool break up, give them a good  shake in a rough sieve to free them from any machine scraps; the drops  are then ready for bottling. Powdered sugar is not usually mixed with  these drops.      PEAR DROPS.      14 lbs. White Sugar.    3 lbs Glucose.    1/4 oz. Essence of Pear.    1 oz. Tartaric Acid.    2 quarts water.

Each year he  came with his troop, and for about six weeks took up his abode on  the hill. Each morning thereafter the crows set out in three bands to  forage. One band went southeast to Ashbridge's Bay. One went north up  the Don, and one, the largest, went northwestward up the ravine. The  last, Silverspot led in person. Who led the others I never found out.    On calm mornings they flew high and straight away. But when it was  windy the band flew low, and followed the ravine for shelter. My windows  overlooked the ravine, and it was thus that in 1885 I first noticed this  old crow. I was a newcomer in the neighborhood, but an old resident  said to me then \"that there old crow has been a-flying up and down this  ravine for more than twenty years.\" My chances to watch were in the  ravine, and Silverspot doggedly clinging to the old route, though now  it was edged with houses and spanned by bridges, became a very familiar  acquaintance. Twice each day in March and part of April, then again  in the late summer and the fall, he passed and repassed, and gave me  chances to see his movements, and hear his orders to his bands, and so,  little by little, opened my eyes to the fact that the crows, though a  little people, are of great wit, a race of birds with a language and a  social system that is wonderfully human in many of its chief points, and  in some is better carried out than our own.    One windy day I stood on the high bridge across the ravine, as the old  crow, heading his long, straggling troop, came flying down homeward.  Half a mile away I could hear the contented 'All's well, come right  along!' as we should say, or as he put it, and as also his lieutenant  echoed it at the rear of the band. They were flying very low to be out  of the wind, and would have to rise a little to clear the bridge on  which I was. Silverspot saw me standing there, and as I was closely  watching him he didn't like it. He checked his flight and called out,  'Be on your guard,' and rose much higher in the air. Then seeing that I  was not armed he flew over my head about twenty feet, and his followers  in turn did the same, dipping again to the old level when past the  bridge.    Next day I was at the same place, and as the crows came near I raised my  walking stick and pointed it at them. The old fellow at once cried out  'Danger,' and rose fifty feet higher than before. Seeing that it was not  a gun, he ventured to fly over. But on the third day I took with me a  gun, and at once he cried out, 'Great danger--a gun.' His lieutenant  repeated the cry, and every crow in the troop began to tower and scatter  from the rest, till they were far above gun shot, and so passed safely  over, coming down again to the shelter of the valley when well beyond  reach. Another time, as the long, straggling troop came down the valley,  a red-tailed hawk alighted on a tree close by their intended route. The  leader cried out, 'Hawk, hawk,' and stayed his flight, as did each crow  on nearing him, until all were massed in a solid body. Then, no longer  fearing the hawk, they passed on. But a quarter of a mile farther on  a man with a gun appeared below, and the cry, 'Great danger--a gun,  a--gun; scatter fur your lives,' at once caused them to scatter widely  and tower till far beyond range. Many others of his words of command I  learned in the course of my long acquaintance, and found that sometimes  a very little difference in the sound makes a very great difference in  meaning. Thus while No. 5 means hawk, or any large, dangerous bird, this  means 'wheel around,' evidently a combination of No. 5, whose root idea  is danger, and of No. 4, whose root idea is retreat, and this again is a  mere 'good day,' to a far away comrade. This is usually addressed to the  ranks and means 'attention.'    Early in April there began to be great doings among the crows. Some new  cause of excitement seemed to have come on them. They spent half the  day among the pines, instead of foraging from dawn till dark. Pairs  and trios might be seen chasing each other, and from time to time they  showed off in various feats of flight. A favorite sport was to dart down  suddenly from a great height toward some perching crow, and just before  touching it to turn at a hairbreadth and rebound in the air so fast  that the wings of the swooper whirred with a sound like distant thunder.  Sometimes one crow would lower his head, raise every feather, and coming  close to another would gurgle out a long note like. What did it all  mean? I soon learned. They were making love and pairing off. The males  were showing off their wing powers and their voices to the lady crows.  And they must have been highly appreciated, for by the middle of April  all had mated and had scattered over the country for their honeymoon,  leaving the sombre old pines of Castle Frank deserted and silent.    II    The Sugar Loaf hill stands alone in the Don Valley. It is still covered  with woods that join with those of Castle Frank, a quarter of a mile  off in the woods, between the two hills, is a pine-tree in whose top  is a deserted hawk's nest. Every Toronto school-boy knows the nest, and,  excepting that I had once shot a black squirrel on its edge, no one had  ever seen a sign of life about it. There it was year after year, ragged  and old, and falling to pieces. Yet, strange to tell, in all that time  it never did drop to pieces, like other old nests.    One morning in May I was out at gray dawn, and stealing gently through  the woods, whose dead leaves were so wet that no rustle was made. I  chanced to pass under the old nest, and was surprised to see a black  tail sticking over the edge. I struck the tree a smart blow, off flew a  crow, and the secret was out. I had long suspected that a pair of  crows nested each year about the pines, but now I realized that it was  Silverspot and his wife. The old nest was theirs, and they were too wise  to give it an air of spring-cleaning and housekeeping each year. Here  they had nested for long, though guns in the hands of men and boys  hungry to shoot crows were carried under their home every day. I never  surprised the old fellow again, though I several times saw him through  my telescope.    One day while watching I saw a crow crossing the Don Valley with  something white in his beak. He flew to the mouth of the Rosedale Brook,  then took a short flight to the Beaver Elm. There he dropped the white  object, and looking about gave me a chance to recognize my old friend  Silverspot. After a minute he picked up the white thing--a shell--and  walked over past the spring, and here, among the docks and the  skunk-cabbages, he unearthed a pile of shells and other white, shiny  things. He spread them out in the sun, turned them over, turned them one  by one in his beak, dropped them, nestled on them as though they were  eggs, toyed with them and gloated over them like a miser. This was his  hobby, his weakness. He could not have explained why he enjoyed them,  any more than a boy can explain why he collects postage-stamps, or a  girl why she prefers pearls to rubies; but his pleasure in them was very  real, and after half an hour he covered them all, including the new  one, with earth and leaves, and flew off. I went at once to the spot  and examined the hoard; there was about a hatfull in all, chiefly white  pebbles, clam-shells, and some bits of tin, but there was also the  handle of a china cup, which must have been the gem of the collection.  That was the last time I saw them. Silverspot knew that I had found his  treasures, and he removed them at once; where, I never knew.    During the space that I watched him so closely he had many little  adventures and escapes. He was once severely handled by a sparrowhawk,  and often he was chased and worried by kingbirds. Not that these did him  much harm, but they were such noisy pests that he avoided their company  as quickly as possible, just as a grown man avoids a conflict with a  noisy and impudent small boy. He had some cruel tricks, too. He had a  way of going the round of the small birds' nests each morning to eat the  new laid eggs, as regularly as a doctor visiting his patients. But we  must not judge him for that, as it is just what we ourselves do to the  hens in the barnyard.    His quickness of wit was often shown. One day I saw him flying down the  ravine with a large piece of bread in his bill. The stream below him was  at this time being bricked over as a sewer. There was one part of two  hundred yards quite finished, and, as he flew over the open water just  above this, the bread fell from his bill, and was swept by the current  out of sight into the tunnel. He flew down and peered vainly into  the dark cavern, then, acting upon a happy thought, he flew to the  downstream end of the tunnel, and awaiting the reappearance of the  floating bread, as it was swept onward by the current, he seized and  bore it off in triumph.    Silverspot was a crow of the world. He was truly a successful crow. He  lived in a region that, though full of dangers, abounded with food. In  the old, unrepaired nest he raised a brood each year with his wife,  whom, by the way, I never could distinguish, and when the crows again  gathered together he was their acknowledged chief.    The reassembling takes place about the end of June--the young crows with  their bob-tails, soft wings, and falsetto voices are brought by their  parents, whom they nearly equal in size, and introduced to society at  the old pine woods, a woods that is at once their fortress and college.  Here they find security in numbers and in lofty yet sheltered perches,  and here they begin their schooling and are taught all the secrets of  success in crow life, and in crow life the least failure does not simply  mean begin again. It means "]]]
