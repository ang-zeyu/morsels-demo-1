Evolutionists  claim that \"man's superiority over the brute results from greater  complexity and superior development of the brain.\" Now if man, as they  say, once lived the life of the brute, and his superiority now is simply  quantitative, why is it that his inferiors of to-day are not passing  into real manhood? They are far superior to any creature which is \"not  far from the tadpole stage of evolution.\" If we were once there, and  evolutionists say we were, why not take all brutes in as our  _kins-folk_.    Now, since evolutionists have learned the secret of mind-making by  training dogs and other animals to certain habits, and giving time for  heredity to transmit those habits, they being \"immediately petrified in  brain structure,\" why should we not go to work and bring about a  millennial glory, at least by the third or fourth generation? If so much  has been overcome as lies between man and the tadpole, with the tadpole  capital only to work upon, perhaps we might, with our present capital,  bring into existence a race of gods. Why not? We are taught that  \"instinct is habit petrified in brain structure and transmitted by  heredity,\" that it is, consequently, \"organized ancestral experiences  that are the source of instinct, but not always.\" Why this modification  in the teachings of evolutionists? Do they not know that the  acknowledgment of the existence of an original instinctive endowment  breaks down the whole theory of mind-being from environments? And what  right have Atheists to claim instinct as an original endowment, in  certain cases? The very idea is destructive of their speculation, for in  order to an original endowment, as they term it, over and above that  which is the result of ancestral experiences petrified in brain  structure and transmitted, there must be the endowment, that which  endows, and the endowed. These three things stand or fall together. But  why should they claim this exception of an original endowment? The  answer is easy. Facts that are utterly against them are known to exist  in the world of instincts. We have an example in the instinct of the  honey bee. Neither the drone nor the queen ever built a cell. So this is  conceded to be an original endowment. O, ye evolutionists! will you tell  us where this cell-building instinct came from? You claim that it was,  or is, an original endowment. _From whom?_ Again you tell us that  instinct depends upon brain structure in every instance; then what is  the difference between instinct and intellect or mind? You tell us that  mind also depends on brain structure, and you say that intelligence is  unlike instinct, because it works by experience, not ancestral, but, on  the contrary, by individual experience.    Then we have it thus:    First. Instinct works by ancestral experience, petrified in brain  structure, and transmitted.    Second. Mind works by individual and not ancestral experience.    Third. Instinct is sometimes an original endowment.    Now, can we or any others tell how it is that mind depends, just like  instinct, wholly upon brain structure, and is, at the same time, unlike  instinct in that it is wholly dependent on individual, not ancestral  experience? And if mind or intelligence does not depend on ancestral  experience, how is its origin to be accounted for on the hypothesis of  heredity through evolution of species, starting, without life, instinct  or mind, by blind forces operating on dead matter, and the forces  themselves simply the forces of dead matter? The capacity for  intellectual improvement is a remarkable peculiarity of man's nature.  The instinctive habits of the lower animals are limited, are peculiar to  each species, and have immediate reference to their bodily wants. Where  a particular adaptation of means to ends, of actions to circumstances,  is made by an individual the rest do not seem to profit by that  experience, so that, although the instincts of particular animals may be  modified by the training of man, or by the education of circumstances,  so as to show themselves after a few generations under new forms, no  elevation of intelligence ever appears to _take place spontaneously_, no  physical improvement is manifested in the species at large. On the other  hand, we observe in man not merely the capability of profiting by  experience, but the determination to do so, which he is enabled to put  into action by the power which his will, when properly disciplined,  comes to possess, of directing and controlling his current of thought by  fixing his attention upon any subject which he desires to keep before  his mental vision. This power, so far as we know, is peculiar to man,  and the presence or absence of it constitutes the difference between a  being possessed of powers to determine his own course of thought and  action, and a mere thinking automaton.--_Carpenter's Physiology._          REVIVAL OF LEARNING.      TO WHOM ARE WE INDEBTED?    Charlemagne, Emperor of Germany, who is known as a Christian prince, and  Alfred the Great, of England, lived in the eight and ninth centuries.  The darkest period in the dark ages was between the fifth and the  eleventh, but they are known as the _earliest_ luminaries of the modern  world. They encouraged learning both by example and patronage, but they  could not overcome the gross ignorance of their times; nevertheless they  shed a strong and living lustre over the age in which they lived. (See  _Elements of General Knowledge_, by Henry Kelt, Fellow and Tutor of  Trinity College, Oxford, p. 246.) Where, and under what circumstances,  were their schools established? They were confined to churches and  monasteries, and the monks presided over them, but they were inadequate  to the task of diffusing knowledge in any extensive circle. The reign of  heathenism and ignorance continued.    The Arabians had introduced the knowledge of arithmetic, geometry,  astronomy, chemistry, medicine, and the philosophy of Aristotle into  Spain. (See Warton on Pope, vol. 1, p. 184.) At the beginning of the  eleventh century several enlightened scholars undertook to educate the  youth of the cities of Italy, and at a later period those of France,  England and Germany. To the stability and prevalence of the education  thus begun is the establishment of the universities of Europe  attributable. Those of Paris and Oxford carry their claims to antiquity  to the times of Alfred and Charlemagne, but it is said that the real  claims of Paris stop with Phillip Augustus in the twelfth century. In  the year 1264 Merton College was founded by Walter de Merton, Lord  Chancellor of England and Bishop of Rochester, but the honorable title,  \"Mother of Universities of Europe\" is due to Bologna. It was in her  walls that learning, in the eleventh century, first attempted to raise  her head.    It is said upon good authority that 10,000 students were assembled here  in the next century, that is, somewhere about the beginning of the  fourteenth century, and that each country in Europe had its resident  regents and professors at Bologna. Here the studies of the civil and  canon law constituted the almost exclusive objects of application, but  Paris directed the attention of her scholars to theology. Oxford began  at this time to acquire fame and to rival the foreign universities in  the ability of its professors and the multitude of its members; in the  year 1340 they amounted to 30,000. Many other universities were soon  established upon the models of Bologna, Paris and Oxford. In these logic  and scholastic divinity were for centuries the reigning subjects of  pursuit. The works of Aristotle were studied with great eagerness. Upon  the logic of Aristotle was founded the cultivation of scholastic  theology and casuistry, which is a department of morals; its object is  to lay down rules for directing us _how_ to act where there is any room  for doubt or hesitation. To this belongs the decision of what are called  cases of conscience, that is, cases in which we are under obligation,  but which, from certain surroundings, give rise to doubt, or how far the  obligation may be dissolved; such as the obligation to keep a promise  obtained by fraud or force.    To make nice distinctions between one word and another, to separate  subjects by infinite divisions, not as the real nature of things, but as  fancy directed, and to draw conclusions with no moral end in view, were  the pursuits of the schoolmen. The decrees of the councils of the Church  of Rome, its edicts and ceremonial and ritual observances, were  scrupulously regarded instead of obedience to the pure and practical  elements of Christianity. Classical learning was entirely neglected.  Here is the feature of Roman church history which infidels have  endeavored to use falsely against _even Rome_, to wit: the opposition of  the churchmen of those times to _classical learning_. This was  considered dangerous to true piety, and calculated to corrupt the pure  theology of the gospel, because the orators of Greece and Rome were  regarded as blind guides of erring reason and seducers to the paths of  sin and destruction. Virgil and Horace were looked upon merely as the  advocates of a profane and idolatrous mythology, and Cicero was regarded  as a vain declaimer, impiously elated with the talent of Pagan  eloquence, but the infidel charge that the church has always been in the  way of scientific education, _expressed in unqualified terms_, is simply  false in fact. That there was a time when she was opposed to classical  learning is a well attested fact, but she, at the same time, taught and  operated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28677"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume I, No. (#5)"],[1,"other it  is used with reference to the _words spoken_, which they _understood  not_. So it is said, they heard them not. Can you hear a man speaking in  a dead language? You can hear the voice in the sense of hearing the  noise, but you can't hear the voice in the sense of _hearing the  language_. No man can hear a language unless he understands it in the  sense of the original term.    _Your fourth case is in the following quotations_: \"And Jacob called the  name of the place Peniel; for I have seen God face to face, and my life  is preserved.\"--Gen. xxxii, 30. It somehow happens that my good querist  in giving this quotation refers me to the 31st chapter, which is wrong  again. He says he has taken advice, and has read the contexts. Well,  perhaps he has. But this is the second mistake _any way_. The first is  reference to the wrong book. The second is reference to the wrong  chapter. How is this?    Our querist's contrary is, however, in these words, \"No man hath seen  God at any time.\"--John's Record i, 18. Our friend, proposing these  contradictions for my consideration, says he has \"given himself the  trouble to investigate;\" has \"read the context in connection with each  quotation, and still they are not clear,\" yet for the last quotation he  refers me to 1 John iv, 12. Well, well; how shall we understand this?  And how shall we harmonize the quotations? Well, \"No man hath seen _God_  at any time\"--this is true, for he is \"the King Eternal, immortal,  _invisible_, whom no man hath seen\" with the literal eye, \"_nor can  see_.\" This teaching is positive and pointed, but in ancient times even  \"those to whom the word of God was sent were called gods.\" So said  Jesus. The one Jacob saw was called a man. And again, there was a  messenger--an angel, if you please--that bore Jehovah's name upon him.  (See Exodus xxiii, 21, _and context_.) This was the angel of God's  presence. \"The angel of his presence saved them.\"--Isaiah lxiii, 9.  God's great messenger bore his name. Men saw him, the angel, and seeing  him saw God, for this angel was God with them--God's representative  bearing his name. This angel God, or angel having God's name in him,  talked with Moses. Moses saw him, and it is truthfully said that Moses  saw God, that is, saw this angel whose name was that of God. \"And when  forty years were transpired there appeared to him, Moses, in the  wilderness of Mount Sinai, an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a  bush. When Moses saw it he wondered at the sight, and as he drew near to  behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him.\" * * * * * This (Moses)  is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which  spoke to him in the Mount Sinai and with our fathers, etc. Moses went  up into Sinai and saw God, but it was simply the angel that bore his  name--the angel of his presence. That is all there is of it. I once sat  in a church-house in Logansport when there were present representatives  from different states in our Union, and a gentleman made a little  address and introduced them to the audience, saying, Ohio is here, Iowa  is here, Kentucky is here, Illinois is here, California is here. How was  this? Well, those men were messengers from those states, and their  presence was the presence of those several states. Just so the angel of  God's presence was with Moses; and Stephen said, _with our fathers_. The  presence of this angel was the presence of God, and they who saw him saw  God, for this angel's name was _God_, or, in other words, \"God's name  was in him.\" But the God whose name this angel bore, and whose name even  men bore who were called Gods, because to them the word of God was sent,  and they, having God's word, were his representatives, _has not been  seen at any time, neither indeed can be with literal eyes_.

SOME THINGS THAT NEED THOUGHT.      It has been said of past nations, that side by side have grown in their  midst the elements both of greatness and of ruin. There is one phase of  our society, as Americans, which is more to be dreaded than all others  known to the philosophic mind, that is the reckless licentiousness which  characterizes many politicians during political campaigns.    In ancient times a grand safeguard against this debasing practice was  found in the law that said, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of  my people.\" This evil, like all others, when it becomes a strong habit,  is well calculated to stir up anger, and wrath, and hatred; to stir up  the passions, and destroy confidence, which is always and only  disastrous to the social state. This growing evil needs to be checked  by some means, otherwise our country will experience tumults growing out  of maddened party ambition, and party interests, which will cause  disaster and grief. The ballot-box needs to be guarded with wise and  severe laws, because it is the pivotal wheel in our government. And next  to this, because of the relation it sustains to our government's  welfare, is the reputation of our public officials. I would not screen  them from their just deserts, but I do say that the leaders in political  affairs should be, in common with all others, too high-minded to indulge  in slandering each other, as many are in the habit of doing. It reminds  me in some of our political campaigns of the cursing-matches of the  Popes, in some of the councils that were held during the dark ages. It  is possible that we have in Indiana, and perhaps in some of the other  states, sufficient law upon the subjects of slander, but law that is  disregarded, being seldom enforced, amounts to nothing. Then, there is a  disposition growing out of the pride of character to disregard the  slanderer's tongue. Yet licentiousness tends to civil and social ruin  all the same. That is to say, it destroys confidence, breeds retaliation  and corruption, and inflames all the baser passions known in the dying  agonies of a civil government. As an American citizen I would warn our  people to manufacture all the public sentiment possible against this  low, vile, and debasing practice, by pleading with our countrymen  against it. And let us never hold our peace until we shall have thrown  such safeguard around our ballot-box as will put an end to all the  abominable corruptions that now threaten our existence as a free people.  Is it true of us, that we carry the seeds of our own destruction as a  nation in our own bosom? Are we to die as a nation, over the ballot-box?  Shall we be so foolish? Let statesmen and politicians look well to the  essential elements of the nation's life, by the advocacy of reform at  this point where reform is most needed. And let Christians of every name  plead for morality as an essential qualification for a place at the head  of so great affairs as belong of right to the people of counties, states  and nation. Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any  people. It is time for us to look after the moral elements of every  man's life who proposes himself as a candidate for office in our midst,  but we can well afford to be satisfied with the truth. Shall we look to  this?    While we pray as Christians for such rulers and authorities as will look  to the permanent and lasting interests of our country, let us vote as we  pray. Do we pray one way and vote another? If so, let us repent. Do we  pray for righteous rulers and for a good government and then vote for  profane, wicked men; for men of intemperate habits, men who are  perfectly indifferent to the moral welfare of our country; men who will  disregard the welfare of the nation by neglecting the elements of  national greatness? If political parties triumph in this government  through slander, trickery, whisky and corruption, and continue to do so,  the time will inevitably come when we will realize the facts of national  ruin. We might as well think of a man having good health and living long  upon the earth who takes poison into his stomach continually, as to  think of future glory as a nation if we carry out our purposes by  dishonest, illegal measures and by railing, in a slanderous and  unjustifiable manner, against the best men of the nation. It has been  said that political parties are necessary as checks to corruption, but  when parties themselves indulge in all manner of corruption in order to  succeed as parties, they are no longer checks, but abettors of  corruption.    Let the preachers, whose business it is to reprove sin, and who have  been kept from taking the risk of being shut out of Paradise, by being  kept out of politics(?) open their mouths and be heard all over this  country against all these immoral, vile practices indulged as a means of  political success. The ignorant, fossilized partisan who looks no higher  than party will perhaps raise a yell of indignation against them, but at  the same time he will continue the use of the same old argument, viz:  the pool of politics is too filthy for preachers to meddle with. Is it a  filthy pool? Then let us bring all the purifying elements of the nation  to bear upon it and see if there is anything in it besides corruption.  If there is not, the sooner we find it out the better, and if there is,  the sooner we get it separated from its corruption the better.          THE RELIGION AND SOCIETY OF GREECE.    HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH OURS.      From the Egyptians and other nations to whom the Grecians were indebted  for their earliest laws, they derived their established religion. To the  worship of the twelve principal divinities the gratitude of the  succeeding ages added the deification of heroes and legislators renowned  for their important services to society. Various degrees of adoration  were paid to the gods and to the souls of departed heroes. Temples were  erected,"]]]
