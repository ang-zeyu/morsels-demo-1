In the  commencement of that period, we may see, if not the setting, at any rate  the declension of that system of personal rule which had existed under  previous sovereigns, and which, after a brief and spasmodic revival in  the time of George the Third, has now sunk, let us hope, into the limbo  of forgotten things. The latter part of that 100 years saw the dawn  of that system of free government which has grown and flourished, and  which, if the men of the present day be the worthy descendants of Eliott  and Pym, and Hampden and Milton, will go on growing as long as this  realm lasts. Within that time, one of the strangest phenomena which I  think I may say any nation has ever manifested arose to its height and  fell--I mean that strange and altogether marvellous phenomenon, English  Puritanism. Within that time, England had to show statesmen like  Burleigh, Strafford, and Cromwell--I mean men who were real statesmen,  and not intriguers, seeking to make a reputation at the expense of the  nation. In the course of that time, the nation had begun to throw off  those swarms of hardy colonists which, to the benefit of the world--and  as I fancy, in the long run, to the benefit of England herself--have  now become the United States of America; and, during the same epoch,  the first foundations were laid of that Indian Empire which, it may be,  future generations will not look upon as so happy a product of English  enterprise and ingenuity. In that time we had poets such as Spenser,  Shakespere, and Milton; we had a great philosopher, in Hobbes; and we  had a clever talker about philosophy, in Bacon. In the beginning of the  period, Harvey revolutionized the biological sciences, and at the end of  it, Newton was preparing the revolution of the physical sciences. I know  not any period of our history--I doubt if there be any period of the  history of any nation--which has precisely such a record as this to  show for a hundred years. But I do not recall these facts to your  recollection for a mere vainglorious purpose. I myself am of opinion  that the memory of the great men of a nation is one of its most precious  possessions--not because we have any right to plume ourselves upon their  having existed as a matter of national vanity, but because we have a  just and rational ground of expectation that the race which has brought  forth such products as these may, in good time and under fortunate  circumstances, produce the like again. I am one of those people who  do not believe in the natural decay of nations. I believe, to speak  frankly, though perhaps not quite so politely as I could wish--but I  am getting near the end of my lecture--that the whole theory is a  speculation invented by cowards to excuse knaves. My belief is, that so  far as this old English stock is concerned it has in it as much sap  and vitality and power as it had two centuries ago; and that, with due  pruning of rotten branches, and due hoeing up of weeds, which will grow  about the roots, the like products will be yielded again. The \"weeds\"  to which I refer are mainly three: the first of them is dishonesty, the  second is sentimentality, and the third is luxury. If William Harvey had  been a dishonest man--I mean in the high sense of the word--a man who  failed in the ideal of honesty--he would have believed what it was  easiest to believe--that which he received on the authority of his  predecessors. He would not have felt that his highest duty was to know  of his own knowledge that that which he said he believed was true, and  we should never have had those investigations, pursued through good  report and evil report, which ended in discoveries so fraught with  magnificent results for science and for man. If Harvey had been a  sentimentalist--by which I mean a person of false pity, a person who  has not imagination enough to see that great, distant evils may be much  worse than those which we can picture to ourselves, because they  happen to be immediate and near (for that, I take it, is the essence of  sentimentalism)--if Harvey had been a person of that kind, he, being  one of the kindest men living, would never have pursued those researches  which, as he tells us over and over again, he was obliged to pursue in  order to the ascertainment of those facts which have turned out to be of  such inestimable value to the human race; and I say, if on such grounds  he had failed to do so, he would have failed in his duty to the human  race. The third point is that Harvey was devoid of care either for  wealth, or for riches, or for ambition. The man found a higher ideal  than any of these things in the pursuit of truth and the benefit of his  fellow-men. If we all go and do likewise, I think there is no fear for  the decadence of England. I think that our children and our successors  will find themselves in a commonwealth, different it may be from that  for which Eliott, and Pym, and Hampden struggled, but one which will be  identical in the substance of its aims--great, worthy, and well to live  in.

All federal aid funds allotted to a state must be expended under the  direction of the state highway department.    =Federal Administration.=--Federal authority in highway work is vested  in the Bureau of Public Roads of the United States Department of  Agriculture. The official head is the Secretary of Agriculture, but  the administrative head is the Director of the Bureau. In this Bureau  are the various instrumentalities needed for carrying on  investigations and furnishing information to the various states on  highway subjects. The Bureau also supervises the construction of  federal aid roads in a general way through district engineers, each  of whom looks after the work in several states.    Funds for the support of the Bureau of Public Roads are obtained from  congressional appropriations to the Department of Agriculture and from  a percentage of the funds appropriated for federal aid.    Federal aid is money appropriated by Congress to be distributed to the  various states to stimulate road construction. It is granted to the  states on the condition that the states will expend at least an equal  amount on the projects involved. The states in turn usually give a  suitable part of the state allotment to each county. There are various  limitations as to the amount of federal aid per mile of road and the  type of construction that may be employed, but these are matters of  regulation that change from time to time.    It will be seen that each of the administrative authorities, except  the Bureau of Public Roads, is to some extent subservient to a higher  authority, and the Bureau of Public Roads is supervised by the United  States Congress. Considerable diplomacy is required on the part of any  administrative authority if his contact with other officials is to be  without friction. This is especially true in connection with the  formulation of a policy regarding the types of construction to be  adopted for an improvement. The responsibility for the selection is  variously placed on the township, county or state authority, the laws  not being uniform in this respect. If state or federal funds are  allotted to an improvement, the state authority either makes the  selection of the type of construction or the selection is made by some  subordinate authority subject to the approval of the state highway  department. Where the improvement is paid for exclusively with  township or county funds, the selection is often made by the township  or county authority without review by higher authority. Many abuses  have crept into highway administration through the unscrupulous  methods of promoters of the sale of road materials or road machinery.  A great deal of the selling activity of the agents for these  commodities is entirely irreproachable, but it is well known that such  is not always the case. As a result, the tendency of legislation is to  require the state highway department to approve contracts for  materials or construction entered into by the township or county  authorities. The state highway departments can secure the requisite  technical experts to determine the merits of materials and equipment  and, in spite of some glaring examples of inefficiency or worse, have  made a good record for impartiality and integrity as custodians of the  funds for which they are responsible.      HIGHWAY FINANCE    The paramount problem in highway administration is the development of  an adequate financial plan for carrying on road improvement. The  necessary expenditures are enormous, although the money so expended is  probably much less than the actual benefit resulting from the  improvements.    =Special Assessments.=--There is presumed to be a direct and  recognized benefit conferred on farm lands by the construction of  improved highways adjacent thereto. Therefore, it is equitable to  charge a part of the cost against the lands so benefited.    The principle of paying for public improvements by a special  assessment upon private property has been long established and a large  proportion of the public improvements in the cities and towns have  been made financially possible through the medium of special  assessments on abutting and adjacent property. The same principle has  been applied to the financing of drainage projects for reclaiming farm  lands. Recently the special assessment method has come into limited  use in financing rural highway improvements. The policy in such cases  is to assess the abutting and adjacent property in a zone along the  improved road for a percentage of the cost of the improvement. The  amount so assessed does not ordinarily exceed one-fourth of the total  cost of the improvement and may be considerably less. The assessment  is spread over an area extending back from one to six miles from the  improved road. The assessment area is generally divided into about  four zones parallel to the road. The zone next the road is assessed at  a rate arbitrarily determined as a fair measure of the benefit, and  each succeeding zone is assessed at a somewhat lower rate. Generally  about three-fourths of the total assessment is placed on the half of  the assessment area lying next to the road.    Many systems of making assessments have been proposed which are  mechanical in application after the area and rate of distribution of  benefit have been established, but in practice it is always found  necessary to make adjustments on individual parcels of land because of  variation in benefits received and it is impossible to eliminate the  exercise of human judgment in equalizing the assessments.    =Zone Method of Assessing.=--The area to be assessed on each side of  the improved road is divided into zones usually four in number, but a  larger or smaller number of zones may be adopted. The rate for each  zone is then arbitrarily determined. For a typical case, the first of  four zones would receive an assessment of 50 per cent of the amount to  be borne by the area; the second zone 25 per cent, the third 15 per  cent and the fourth 10 per cent. Other percentages sometimes adopted  are 45, 25, 20 and 10 and 60, 20, 15 and 5. The set of percentages  first mentioned seems to insure the most equitable distribution for an  area all of which is substantially equally productive.    When a road, for the improvement of which an assessment is being made,  lies on two or more sides of a parcel of land all of which is within  the assessment area, the rate is arbitrarily reduced to relieve that  parcel of land somewhat, or the assessment is first spread as above  outlined and afterward equalized as judgment dictates.    In applying the zone method some difficulty is encountered in  determining an equitable distribution on those parcels of land lying  partly in one zone and partly in another, but the rate may be arrived  at with reasonable accuracy by pro-rating in accordance with the exact  conditions.    In. Fig. 1, let it be assumed that the assessment area is to be two  miles wide, one mile on each side of the road and the various  ownerships to be indicated by the parcels of land numbered 1 to 8, as  shown. Each zone for the assessment of the 3-1/4 mile section is 1/4  mile wide and the rates for the several zones are 50, 25, 15 and 10  per cent respectively. Let it be assumed that the portion of the cost  of the 3-1/4 miles of road to be assessed on the area shown is  $20,000. The assessment would then be as follows:      ------+-------+----------------------+------------+-------------          |       |  Rate x frontage on  | Amount of  |    Parcel|  Rate |  improved road =     | Assessment |  Assessment          |       |  assessment units    | per unit[1]|      1   |    2  |         3            |     4      |      5    ------+-------+----------------------+------------+-------------      1   |  a 50 |  50 x 2640 = 132,000 | $0.016655  |  $1558.46          |  b 75 |  75 x 1320 =  99,000 |            |   1153.90      2   |    40 |  40 x 2640 = 105,600 |            |   1230.77      3   |    10 |  10 x 2640 =  26,400 |            |    307.69      4   |    25 |  25 x 1320 =  33,000 |            |    384.66      5   | [2]85 |  85 x 5280 = 448,800 |            |   5230.88      6   |    15 |  15 x 5280 =  79,200 |            |   923.08      7   | [2]65 |  65 x 7920 = 514,800 |            |   6000.00      8   |    35 |  35 x 7920 = 277,200 |            |   3230.77          |       |  ------------------- |            | -----------          |       |            1,716,000 |            | $20000.00    ------+-------+----------------------+------------+-------------        [1] The assessment per unit is obtained by dividing the total      assessment by the total of column three.        [2] On these two parcels, it is decided that more than half of      the zone rate should apply to the half of the zone toward the      improved road, but some modification of the rates adopted might be      justified.    [Illustration: Fig. 1]    The assessment of the cost of the east and west one-mile section of  road is made up in like manner, and let it be assumed that the portion  of the cost of this road that is to be assessed on the area shown is  $5500.
