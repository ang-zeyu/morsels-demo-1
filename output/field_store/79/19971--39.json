But they were proud of their Confederate  records though now legally \"loyal\" to the United States; they considered  the Negro as free but inferior, and expected to be permitted to fix his  status in the social organization and to solve the problem of free labor  in their own way. To embarrass the easy and permanent realization of  these views there was a society disrupted, economically prostrate,  deprived of its natural leaders, subjected to a control not always  wisely conceived nor effectively exercised, and, finally, containing  within its own population unassimilated elements which presented  problems fraught with difficulty and danger.        CHAPTER II. WHEN FREEDOM CRIED OUT    The Negro is the central figure in the reconstruction of the South.  Without the Negro there would have been no Civil War. Granting a war  fought for any other cause, the task of reconstruction would, without  him, have been comparatively simple. With him, however, reconstruction  meant more than the restoring of shattered resources; it meant the more  or less successful attempt to obtain and secure for the freedman civil  and political rights, and to improve his economic and social status.  In 1861, the American Negro was everywhere an inferior, and most of his  race were slaves; in 1865, he was no longer a slave, but whether he was  to be serf, ward, or citizen was an unsettled problem; in 1868, he was  in the South the legal and political equal, frequently the superior, of  the white; and before the end of the reconstruction period he was made  by the legislation of some states and by Congress the legal equal of the  white even in certain social matters.    The race problem which confronted the American people had no parallel  in the past. British and Spanish-American emancipation of slaves had  affected only small numbers or small regions, in which one race greatly  outnumbered the other. The results of these earlier emancipations of the  Negroes and the difficulties of European states in dealing with subject  white populations were not such as to afford helpful example to American  statesmen. But since it was the actual situation in the Southern States  rather than the experience of other countries which shaped the policies  adopted during reconstruction, it is important to examine with some care  the conditions in which the Negroes in the South found themselves at the  close of the war.    The Negroes were not all helpless and without experience \"when freedom  cried out.\"* In the Border States and in the North there were, in 1861,  half a million free Negroes accustomed to looking out for themselves.  Nearly 200,000 Negro men were enlisted in the United States army between  1862 and 1865, and many thousands of slaves had followed raiding Federal  forces to freedom or had escaped through the Confederate lines. State  emancipation in Missouri, Maryland, West Virginia, and Tennessee, and  the practical application of the Emancipation Proclamation where the  Union armies were in control ended slavery for many thousands more.  Wherever the armies marched, slavery ended. This was true even in  Kentucky, where the institution was not legally abolished until the  adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment. Altogether more than a million  Negroes were free and to some extent habituated to freedom before May  1865.         * A Negro phrase much used in referring to emancipation.      Most of these war-emancipated Negroes were scattered along the borders  of the Confederacy, in camps, in colonies, in the towns, on refugee  farms, at work with the armies, or serving as soldiers in the ranks.  There were large working colonies along the Atlantic coast from Maryland  to Florida. The chief centers were near Norfolk, where General Butler  was the first to establish a \"contraband\" camp, in North Carolina, and  on the Sea Islands of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, which had  been seized by the Federal fleet early in the war. To the Sea Islands  also were sent, in 1865, the hordes of Negroes who had followed General  Sherman out of Georgia and South Carolina. Through the border states  from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and along both sides of the  Mississippi from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, there were other  refugee camps, farms, and colonies. For periods varying from one to four  years these free Negroes had been at work, often amid conditions highly  unfavorable to health, under the supervision of officers of the Treasury  Department or of the army.    Emancipation was therefore a gradual process, and most of the Negroes,  through their widening experience on the plantations, with the armies,  and in the colonies, were better fitted for freedom in 1865 than they  had been in 1861. Even their years of bondage had done something  for them, for they knew how to work and they had adopted in part the  language, habits, religion, and morals of the whites. But slavery had  not made them thrifty, self-reliant, or educated. Frederick Douglass  said of the Negro at the end of his servitude: \"He had none of the  conditions of self-preservation or self-protection. He was free from the  individual master, but he had nothing but the dusty road under his feet.  He was free from the old quarter that once gave him shelter, but a slave  to the rains of summer and to the frosts of winter. He was turned loose,  naked, hungry, and destitute to the open sky.\" To prove that he was free  the Negro thought he must leave his old master, change his name, quit  work for a time, perhaps get a new wife, and hang around the Federal  soldiers in camp or garrison, or go to the towns where the Freedmen's  Bureau was in process of organization. To the Negroes who remained at  home--and, curiously enough, for a time at least many did so--the news  of freedom was made known somewhat ceremonially by the master or his  representative. The Negroes were summoned to the \"big house,\" told that  they were free, and advised to stay on for a share of the crop. The  description by Mrs. Clayton, the wife of a Southern general, will  serve for many: \"My husband said, 'I think it best for me to inform our  Negroes of their freedom.' So he ordered all the grown slaves to come to  him, and told them they no longer belonged to him as property, but were  all free. 'You are not bound to remain with me any longer, and I have a  proposition to make to you. If any of you desire to leave, I propose to  furnish you with a conveyance to move you, and with provisions for the  balance of the year.' The universal answer was, 'Master, we want to stay  right here with you.' In many instances the slaves were so infatuated  with the idea of being, as they said, 'free as birds' that they left  their homes and consequently suffered; but our slaves were not so  foolish.\"*         * \"Black and White under the Old Regime\", p. 158,      The Negroes, however, had learned of their freedom before their old  masters returned from the war; they were aware that the issues of the  war involved in some way the question of their freedom or servitude,  and through the \"grapevine telegraph,\" the news brought by the invading  soldiers, and the talk among the whites, they had long been kept fairly  well informed. What the idea of freedom meant to the Negroes it is  difficult to say. Some thought that there would be no more work and that  all would be cared for by the Government; others believed that education  and opportunity were about to make them the equal of their masters. The  majority of them were too bewildered to appreciate anything except the  fact that they were free from enforced labor.    Conditions were most disturbed in the so-called \"Black Belt,\" consisting  of about two hundred counties in the most fertile parts of the South,  where the plantation system was best developed and where by far the  majority of the Negroes were segregated. The Negroes in the four hundred  more remote and less fertile \"white\" counties, which had been less  disturbed by armies, were not so upset by freedom as those of the  Black Belt, for the garrisons and the larger towns, both centers of  demoralization, were in or near the Black Belt. But there was a moving  to and fro on the part of those who had escaped from the South or had  been captured during the war or carried into the interior of the South  to prevent capture. To those who left slavery and home to find freedom  were added those who had found freedom and were now trying to get  back home or to get away from the Negro camps and colonies which  were breaking up. A stream of immigration which began to flow to  the southwest affected Negroes as far as the Atlantic coast. In the  confusion of moving, families were broken up, and children, wife, or  husband were often lost to one another. The very old people and the  young children were often left behind for the former master to care for.  Regiments of Negro soldiers were mustered out in every large town and  their numbers were added to the disorderly mass. Some of the Federal  garrisons and Bureau stations were almost overwhelmed by the numbers of  blacks who settled down upon them waiting for freedom to bestow its full  measure of blessing, and many of the Negroes continued to remain in a  demoralized condition until the new year.    The first year of freedom was indeed a year of disease, suffering,  and death. Several partial censuses indicate that in 1865-66 the Negro  population lost as many by disease as the whites had lost in war.

It would seem that there was cause indeed for watching down the river  by that small, small town that was all of the United States! But there  follows a Spanish memorandum. \"The driving out... by the fleet stationed  to the windward will be postponed for a long time because delay will  be caused by getting it ready.\"* Delay followed delay, and old  Spain--conquistador Spain--grew older, and the speech on Jamestown  Island is still English.         * Op. cit., vol. 1, p. 127.      Christopher Newport was gone; no ships--the last refuges, the last  possibilities for home-turning, should the earth grow too hard and the  sky too black--rode upon the river before the fort. Here was the summer  heat. A heavy breath rose from immemorial marshes, from the ancient  floor of the forest. When clouds gathered and storms burst, they amazed  the heart with their fearful thunderings and lightnings. The colonists  had no well, but drank from the river, and at neither high nor low tide  found the water wholesome. While the ships were here they had help of  ship stores, but now they must subsist upon the grain that they had in  the storehouse, now scant and poor enough. They might fish and hunt, but  against such resources stood fever and inexperience and weakness, and in  the woods the lurking savages. The heat grew greater, the water  worse, the food less. Sickness began. Work became toil. Men pined from  homesickness, then, coming together, quarreled with a weak violence,  then dropped away again into corners and sat listlessly with hanging  heads.    \"The sixth of August there died John Asbie of the bloodie Flixe.

Here was  gross wretchedness, and the colonists proceeded to blame A and B and  C, lost all together in the wilderness. It was this councilor or that  councilor, this ambitious one or that one, this or that almost certainly  ascertained traitor! Wanting to steal the pinnace, the one craft left by  Newport, wanting to steal away in the pinnace and leave the mass--small  enough mass now!--without boat or raft or straw to cling to, made the  favorite accusation. Upon this count, early in September, Wingfield  was deposed from the presidency. Ratcliffe succeeded him, but presently  Ratcliffe fared no better. One councilor fared worse, for George  Kendall, accused of plotting mutiny and pinnace stealing, was given  trial, found guilty, and shot.    \"The eighteenth day [of September] died one Ellis Kinistone.... The same  day at night died one Richard Simmons. The nineteenth day there died one  Thomas Mouton....\"    What went on, in Virginia, in the Indian mind, can only be conjectured.  As little as the white mind could it foresee the trend of events or  the ultimate outcome of present policy. There was exhibited a see-saw  policy, or perhaps no policy at all, only the emotional fit as it came  hot or cold. The friendly act trod upon the hostile, the hostile upon  the friendly. Through the miserable summer the hostile was uppermost;  then with the autumn appeared the friendly mood, fortunate enough for  \"the most feeble wretches\" at Jamestown. Indians came laden with maize  and venison. The heat was a thing of the past; cool and bracing weather  appeared; and with it great flocks of wild fowl, \"swans, geese, ducks  and cranes.\" Famine vanished, sickness decreased. The dead were dead.  Of the hundred and four persons left by Newport less than fifty had  survived. But these may be thought of as indeed seasoned.        CHAPTER IV. JOHN SMITH    With the cool weather began active exploration, the object in chief the  gathering from the Indians, by persuasion or trade or show of force,  food for the approaching winter. Here John Smith steps forward as  leader.    There begins a string of adventures of that hardy and romantic  individual. How much in Smith's extant narrations is exaggeration,  how much is dispossession of others' merits in favor of his own, it is  difficult now to say.* A thing that one little likes is his persistent  depreciation of his fellows. There is but one Noble Adventurer, and that  one is John Smith. On the other hand evident enough are his courage and  initiative, his ingenuity, and his rough, practical sagacity. Let us  take him at something less than his own valuation, but yet as valuable  enough. As for his adventures, real or fictitious, one may see in  them epitomized the adventures of many and many men, English,  French, Spanish, Dutch, blazers of the material path for the present  civilization.         * Those who would strike John Smith from the list of       historians will commend the author's caution to the reader       before she lets the Captain tell his own tale. Whatever       Smith may not have been, he was certainly a consummate       raconteur. He belongs with the renowned story-tellers of the       world, if not with the veracious chroniclers.--Editor.    In December, rather autumn than winter in this region, he starts with  the shallop and a handful of men up a tributary river that they have  learned to call the Chickahominy. He is going for corn, but there is  also an idea that he may hear news of that wished-for South Sea.    The Chickahominy proved itself a wonderland of swamp and tree-choked  streams. Somewhere up its chequered reaches Smith left the shallop with  men to guard it, and, taking two of the party with two Indian guides,  went on in a canoe up a narrower way. Presently those left with the  boat incautiously go ashore and are attacked by Indians. One is taken,  tortured, and slain. The others get back to their boat and so away, down  the Chickahominy and into the now somewhat familiar James. But Smith  with his two men, Robinson and Emry, are now alone in the wilderness, up  among narrow waters, brown marshes, fallen and obstructing tree trunks.  Now come the men-hunting Indians--the King of Pamaunck, says Smith, with  two hundred bowmen. Robinson and Emry are shot full of arrows. Smith  is wounded, but with his musket deters the foe, killing several of the  savages. His eyes upon them, he steps backward, hoping he may beat them  off till he shall recover the shallop, but meets with the ill chance of  a boggy and icy stream into which he stumbles, and here is taken.    See him now before \"Opechancanough, King of Pamaunck!\" Savages and  procedures of the more civilized with savages have, the world over, a  family resemblance. Like many a man before him and after, Smith casts  about for a propitiatory wonder. He has with him, so fortunately, \"a  round ivory double-compass dial.\" This, with a genial manner, he would  present to Opechancanough. The savages gaze, cannot touch through the  glass the moving needle, grunt their admiration. Smith proceeds,  with gestures and what Indian words he knows, to deliver a scientific  lecture. Talking is best anyhow, will give them less time in which to  think of those men he shot. He tells them that the world is round, and  discourses about the sun and moon and stars and the alternation of day  and night. He speaks with eloquence of the nations of the earth, of  white men, yellow men, black men, and red men, of his own country and  its grandeurs, and would explain antipodes.    Apparently all is waste breath and of no avail, for in an hour see him  bound to a tree, a sturdy figure of a man, bearded and moustached, with  a high forehead, clad in shirt and jerkin and breeches and hosen and  shoon, all by this time, we may be sure, profoundly in need of repair.  The tree and Smith are ringed by Indians, each of whom has an arrow  fitted to his bow. Almost one can hear a knell ringing in the forest!  But Opechancanough, moved by the compass, or willing to hear more of  seventeenth-century science, raises his arm and stops the execution.  Unbinding Smith, they take him with them"]]]
