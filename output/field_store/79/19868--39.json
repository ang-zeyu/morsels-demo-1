The  Signallers were taken in hand by 2nd Lieut. J. J. S. Scouler, formerly  attached to the Australian Intelligence Corps, who had passed through a  signalling course in Victoria. He quickly gathered round him a body of  enthusiastic young men whose efficiency subsequently became the envy of  the other battalions and the admiration of the Division. The team for  the two Maxim guns was organised and partly trained by Captain H. B.  Menz. About the middle of May, however, 2nd Lieut. G. D. Shaw was  appointed to the Section, and later commanded it most efficiently until  the date it was absorbed into the 7th Machine Gun Company at Ferry Post,  about the beginning of March, 1916. From the _personnel_ of the original  unit quite a large number of officers for the Machine Gun Corps was  afterwards drawn. 2nd Lieut. T. D. Graham was appointed Transport  Officer, and had little trouble in getting suitable men to look after  and drive his horses and vehicles. He was fortunate in having to assist  him Sergeant F. L. Faulkner, who had served with transport in India.    Captain John Kenny was attached as Regimental Medical Officer. On him  devolved the responsibility for selecting and organising the Army  Medical Corps details and the Stretcher Bearers. Both detachments were  extremely useful. The Pioneers were chosen, and an excellent body of  tradesmen secured. Numbering ten, they were placed under the immediate  control of Sergeant J. W. Anderson--a Scotsman who afterwards became one  of the best known members of the Battalion.    The warrant ranks were filled by the appointment of Sergeant J.  Gettingby as Regimental Sergeant-Major; Sergeant R. G. Sexty as  Regimental Quartermaster-Sergeant; Sergeants B. A. Bell, P. T. C. Bell,  W. S. Appleyard, and H. M. Cousins, as Company Sergeants-Major; and  Sergeants S. Jones, N. Graham, J. R. Gunn, and C. J. Piper as Company  Quartermaster-Sergeants. With two exceptions, all these warrant officers  subsequently attained commissioned rank.    2nd Lieut. C. H. Lamb was confirmed in the appointment of Adjutant and  eventually received promotion to the rank of Captain. Upon him devolved  a mass of detail work. This he handled with energy, skill, and success,  and had very willing help from the Orderly Room Clerks--Sergeants E. C.  Francisco[D] and S. S. Thompson.    A few other special appointments were made: Armourer-Sergeant L. C.  Lewis to do minor repairs to the arms; Sergeant-Drummer W. T. Hocking to  train the buglers and drummers; and Sergeant-Cook T. R. Graham to  supervise and instruct in the kitchens. Shortly after embarkation  Sergeant-Shoemaker F. Cox was allotted the work of looking after the  footwear.    No chaplains were appointed to the Battalion, but four were gazetted to  the Brigade. One of these, the Very Rev. Dean D. A. Brennan, of the  Roman Catholic Denomination, and lately stationed at Narrogin, reported  at Blackboy Camp. For many months he was attached to the 28th and shared  its life in Egypt, Gallipoli, France, and Belgium.    The process of selection for the various appointments and duties took  time. In the meanwhile the work of organising the platoons and companies  continued, and much care was devoted to the training and equipping. For  the first fortnight or so equipment came along very slowly. The Ordnance  Stores were practically empty. Fresh supplies had to be obtained from  the Eastern States, or collected from the Citizen Force units. It was  not until within a few days of embarkation that all demands were met.  This condition of affairs was bound to have an adverse effect on  training, but, on the whole, much progress was made, and the unit soon  began to take form and become easier to administer and handle. The  number of officers available gradually increased, and two warrant or  non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff were attached to  each company in order to assist. The latter did exceedingly valuable  work. A special class was formed for the purpose of instructing in their  duties those men who aspired to wear stripes. In the training of  sections and platoons, emphasis was laid on the necessity for obtaining  a condition of physical fitness, and acquiring a thorough knowledge of  the use of the rifle, the bayonet, and the spade. Physical exercises  were followed by short marches of one or two hours' duration. After  passing the elementary tests, companies, in turn, proceeded to Osborne  Rifle Range and fired the recruits' course of musketry. A satisfactory  figure of merit was obtained. For the more advanced training it was  intended to move the Battalion to a camp at Rockingham. During the  second week in May two companies proceeded there and the camp was  established under the command of Major Davies. However, on account of  the rumoured early embarkation, these companies had to be recalled, and  the whole unit was once more concentrated at Blackboy Hill. Training  proceeded energetically, with the result that officers, and other ranks  within the companies, quickly settled down--daily becoming more and more  accustomed to their tasks.    [Illustration: THE REGIMENTAL SIGNALLERS.]    [Illustration: MACHINE GUN SECTION.  _Photos. lent by Captain G. D. Shaw._]    The health of the members was good. Very few cases of infectious  disease, and fewer cases of serious illness, were reported. The  situation of the camp, together with the insistence on the cleanliness  of the lines and person, had a beneficial effect in this direction.  Unfortunately one death occurred. Private F. W. Hopkins fell into an  unprotected clayhole and was drowned. A few of these excavations existed  on the western edge of the training area, and were a menace to those  taking a short cut from the railway station at night time. All ranks  submitted to vaccination and inoculation. This was unpleasant, but the  medical history of the war has since demonstrated the value of the  measures.    Discipline was fairly satisfactory from the outset and rapidly improved.  At the commencement every member was given to understand that a high  sense of duty and a strong _esprit-de-corps_ were essentials for  success. Both these traits were later very fully developed, and the  regard that 28th men always had for their battalion was a subject of  frequent comment in the A.I.F.    In all the preliminary work of organisation and training, the Commanding  Officer had the great advantage of the sympathy, practical support, and  advice of the District Commandant--Colonel J. H. Bruche. This help was  invaluable, and resulted in the establishment of sound methods and the  promotion of happy relations with mutual confidence between all ranks.    Although training and other duties absorbed long hours, leave was given  daily after the tea hour and until near midnight. Half-holidays were  also observed on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Leave from Saturday afternoon  to Sunday evening was granted, too, on a liberal scale. Before  embarkation every man was entitled to four days' leave in order to give  him a final opportunity of attending to his private affairs. This was  taken by many. In the camp itself efforts were made to amuse those who  stayed in during the evening. In this respect the Y.M.C.A. did most by  providing a large marquee wherein concerts and other forms of  entertainment were given almost nightly. A post office and writing  room--with free stationery--were also established by these voluntary  helpers. Surrounding the camp were numbers of booths and shops where  necessaries could be purchased and harmless refreshments obtained.  Friends and relations frequently visited the camp during the idle hours.    [Illustration: THE MARCH THROUGH PERTH.  3rd June, 1915.  _Photo. lent by Mr. E. L. Mitchell, Perth._]    [Illustration: THE MARCH THROUGH PERTH.  3rd June, 1915.  The crowd in St. George's Terrace.  _Photo. lent by Mr. W. Owen, Perth._]    His Excellency the Governor, Major-General Sir Harry Barron, K.C.M.G.,  C.V.O., showed great interest in the unit, and on the 27th May attended  at the camp and addressed the members in an informal manner after the  evening meal. He told them of his own experiences in the army, and, in a  way that was greatly appreciated, tendered much wholesome advice.    Towards the end of May it was known that the day of embarkation was  closely approaching. Efforts were made to complete the final issues of  kit and clothing, and furnish the seemingly endless number of  documentary records required by the Defence Department. A final and  close inspection of the _personnel_ was carried out. All men in the  Battalion had been pronounced \"fit.\" Vaccinations and inoculations had  been duly performed. Yet there still remained in the ranks a number of  men who, for various reasons, were unfit to go abroad as soldiers.  Others there were whose family affairs were causing them anxiety and  necessitated delay in their departure. Again, others--a few only--felt  their ardour waning as the days of their stay at Blackboy grew fewer. In  all these instances the men concerned were either discharged or  transferred back to the depot units. The Battalion was the better for  the changes.    June 3rd was the anniversary of the Birthday of His Majesty the King.  The 28th, together with certain other troops from the training camps,  was to march through Perth and, in doing so, be inspected by the  Governor and the District Commandant. In preparation, the riding horses  and wheeled transport went to Perth the previous night and parked at the  Drill Hall. The Battalion itself proceeded to the city by train, and by  10.30 on the morning of the 3rd had formed up in James Street. It then  marched by Beaufort, Barrack, Hay, and Bennett Streets; thence along St.  George's Terrace, returning to the Railway Station by Milligan, Hay, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#5)"],[1,"stored it away for the coming rainy day.    [Illustration]          XXIX    DRAWING WATER      Some years ago, a donkey was employed at Carisbrook Castle, in the Isle  of Wight, in drawing water by means of a large wheel from a very deep  well, thought to have been sunk by the Romans. When the keeper wanted  water, he would say to the donkey, \"Tom, my boy, I want water; get into  the wheel, my lad.\" Thomas, thereupon, got in, with a speed and wisdom  that would have done credit to a nobler animal. No doubt he knew the  exact number of times the wheel had to turn upon its axis to bring up  the bucket, because every time he brought it to the surface of the well,  he stopped and turned round his honest head to note the moment when his  master laid hold of the bucket to draw it toward him, because he had  then a nice turn to make either to draw back, or to go ahead a little.  It was pleasing to see with what steadiness and regularity the poor  animal did his work.    [Illustration]          XXX    THE BROKEN HEART      During the French Revolution M. des R----, an ancient magistrate and  most estimable man, was condemned to die on the charge of conspiracy,  and was thrown into prison. M. des R---- had a water spaniel, which had  been brought up by him, and was always with him. Shut out of the prison,  he returned to his master's house, and found it closed. He then took  refuge with a neighbor. Every day at the same hour, the dog left the  house, and went straight to the door of the prison, where he whined  mournfully. He was refused admittance, but each day he spent an hour  before the door, and then went away. His fidelity at last won over the  porter, and one day he was allowed to enter. The dog saw his master and  clung to him. The jailer could hardly drive him away. He came back the  next morning, and every day; once each day he was admitted. He licked  the hand of his friend, looked him in the face, again licked his hand,  and went away of his own accord.    After the execution, at which the dog was present, he walked by the side  of the corpse to its burial place, and after the ceremony laid himself  upon the grave. There he passed the first night, the next day, and the  next night. The neighbor, in the meantime, unhappy at not seeing him,  went in search of his friend, and found him by his master's grave. He  caressed him and made him eat a little food. He even coaxed the  faithful creature away for a few moments, but he soon returned to his  master's grave. Three months passed. The dog came each morning to get  his food, and then returned to the grave. Each day he was more sad, more  lean, more feeble. He was chained up, but broke his fetters; escaped;  returned to the grave, and never left it more. It was in vain that they  tried to get him back. They carried him food, but he ate no longer. For  hours he was seen digging up with his weakened limbs the earth that  separated him from his beloved master. Passion gave him strength, and at  last he was near to the body. Then his faithful heart gave way, and he  breathed out a last gasp, as if he knew he had found his master.    [Illustration]          XXXI    REMORSE      An elephant, from some motive of revenge, killed his mahout, or driver.  The man's wife, who beheld the dreadful scene, took her two children,  and threw them at the feet of the angry animal, saying, \"Since you have  slain my husband, take my life also, and that of my children.\" The  elephant instantly became calm looked at them a moment, and then, as if  stung with remorse, took up the eldest boy with his trunk, placed him on  his neck, adopted him for his driver, and would never afterwards allow  any other person to mount him.    [Illustration]          XXXII    A COMEDY OF ELEPHANTS      In a play exhibited at Rome, in the reign of Tiberius, there were twelve  elephant performers, six male and six female, all fixed up in fancy  costumes. After they had, at the command of their keeper, danced and  performed a thousand curious antics, a most sumptuous feast was served  up for their refreshment. The table was covered with all sorts of  dainties and golden goblets filled with the most precious wines. Couches  covered with purple carpets were placed around for the animals to lie  upon, after the manner of the Romans when feasting, and on these couches  the elephants laid themselves down. At a given signal they reached out  their trunks to the table, and fell to eating and drinking with as much  propriety as if they had been so many men and women.    [Illustration]          XXXIII    CUNNING AS A FOX      An American gentleman was hunting foxes, accompanied by two bloodhounds.  The dogs were soon in scent, and followed a fox nearly two hours, when  suddenly they appeared at fault. The gentleman came up with them near a  large log lying upon the ground, and was much surprised to find them  taking a circuit of a few rods without an object, every trace of the  game seeming to have been lost, while they still kept yelping. On  looking round about himself, he saw sly Reynard stretched upon the log,  as still as if he were dead. The master made several efforts to direct  the attention of his dogs toward the fox, but failed. At last he went so  near the artful creature that he could see it breathe. Even then no  alarm was shown; and the gentleman, seizing a club, aimed a blow at him,  which Reynard evaded by a leap from his strange hiding-place, having  thus for a time effectually eluded his greedy pursuers.    [Illustration]          XXXIV    FAITHFUL THOUGH UNLOVED      A gentleman once owned a mastiff which guarded the house and yard, but  had never any particular attention from his master. One night, as his  master was retiring to his room, attended by his valet, an Italian, the  mastiff silently followed him upstairs, something which he had never  been before known to do, and to his master's astonishment, came into his  bedroom. He was at once turned out; but the poor animal began scratching  violently at the door, and howled loudly for admission. The servant was  sent to drive him away; but again he returned, and seemed more anxious  than before to be let in. Getting tired of his barking, the gentleman  bade the servant open the door, that they might see what it was the  animal wanted to do. As soon as he was let in the dog walked to the bed,  and crawling under it, laid himself down as if intending to spend the  night there. To save farther trouble, this was allowed. About midnight  the chamber door opened, and some one was heard stepping carefully  across the floor. The gentleman started from his sleep; the dog sprang  from his covert, and seizing the unwelcome intruder, fixed him to the  spot. All was dark, and the gentleman rang his bell in great fear in  order to procure a light. The person who was pinned to the floor by the  courageous mastiff was roaring for assistance. It was found to be the  valet, who little expected such a reception. He tried to apologize for  his intrusion, and to make the reasons which led him to take this step  appear plausible; but the importunity of the dog, the time, the place,  the manner of the valet, all raised the suspicions of his master, and he  determined to refer the investigation of the business to a magistrate.  The Italian at length confessed that it was his intention to murder his  master and then rob the house. This he would surely have done, had it  not been for the great wisdom of the dog and his wonderful friendship  for a master who had never treated him with the kindness that he should  have done.    [Illustration]          XXXV    A FAITHFUL COMPANION      A gardener, in removing some rubbish one day, found two ground toads of  uncommon size, weighing no less than seven pounds. While he was watching  them, he was surprised to see that one of them got upon the back of the  other, and then both moved slowly over the ground toward a place of  retreat. Upon further examination he found that the one on the back of  the other had been badly wounded by a blow from his spade, and was thus  unable to get back to its home without the help of its friend.    [Illustration]          XXXVI    ELEPHANT ROPE DANCING      The ease with which the elephant is taught to perform the most difficult  feats forms a remarkable contrast to its huge size and clumsiness.  Aristotle tells us that in ancient times elephants were taught by their  keepers to throw stones at a mark, to cast up arms in the air, and catch  them again on their fall; and to dance, not merely on the earth, but on  the rope. The first, according to the historian Suetonius, who exhibited  elephant rope dancers, was Galba at Rome. The manner of teaching them to  dance on the ground was simple enough (simply music and a very hot  floor); but we are not told how they were taught to skip the rope, or  whether it was the tight or the slack rope, or how high the rope was.  The silence of history on these points is fortunate for the dancers of  the present day; since, but for this, their fame might have been utterly  eclipsed. Elephants may, in the days of old Rome, have been taught to  dance on a rope, but when was an elephant ever known to skip on a rope  over the heads of an audience, or to caper amidst a blaze of fire fifty  feet aloft in the air? What would Aristotle have thought of his dancing  elephants if he had seen some of the elephants who perform to-day?    [Illustration]          XXXVII    A PROVIDENTIAL SAFE CONDUCT      A traveller tells a singular anecdote of a lion, which he says was told  to him by a very credible person. About the year 1614 or 1615, two  Christian slaves at Morocco made their escape, travelling by night, and  hiding themselves in the tops of trees during the day, their Arab  pursuers often passing them by. One night, while travelling along, they  were much astonished and alarmed to see a great lion close by them,  walking when they walked and standing still when"]]]
