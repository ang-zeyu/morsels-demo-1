The confession of the sbirro and the disappearance of Monsignor Guerra  left no moral doubt of the guilt of the Cenci. They were consequently  sent from the castle to the prison; the two brothers, when put to the  torture, broke down and confessed their guilt. Lucrezia Petroni's full  habit of body rendered her unable to bear the torture of the rope, and,  on being suspended in the air, begged to be lowered, when she confessed  all she knew.    As for Beatrice, she continued unmoved; neither promises, threats, nor  torture had any effect upon her; she bore everything unflinchingly, and  the judge Ulysses Moscati himself, famous though he was in such matters,  failed to draw from her a single incriminating word. Unwilling to take  any further responsibility, he referred the case to Clement VIII; and  the pope, conjecturing that the judge had been too lenient in applying  the torture to, a young and beautiful Roman lady, took it out of his  hands and entrusted it to another judge, whose severity and  insensibility to emotion were undisputed.    This latter reopened the whole interrogatory, and as Beatrice up to that  time had only been subjected to the ordinary torture, he gave  instructions to apply both the ordinary and extraordinary. This was the  rope and pulley, one of the most terrible inventions ever devised by the  most ingenious of tormentors.    To make the nature of this horrid torture plain to our readers, we give  a detailed description of it, adding an extract of the presiding judge's  report of the case, taken from the Vatican manuscripts.    Of the various forms of torture then used in Rome the most common were  the whistle, the fire, the sleepless, and the rope.    The mildest, the torture of the whistle, was used only in the case of  children and old persons; it consisted in thrusting between the nails  and the flesh reeds cut in the shape of whistles.    The fire, frequently employed before the invention of the sleepless  torture, was simply roasting the soles of the feet before a hot fire.    The sleepless torture, invented by Marsilius, was worked by forcing the  accused into an angular frame of wood about five feet high, the sufferer  being stripped and his arms tied behind his back to the frame; two men,  relieved every five hours, sat beside him, and roused him the moment he  closed his eyes. Marsilius says he has never found a man proof against  this torture; but here he claims more than he is justly entitled to.  Farinacci states that, out of one hundred accused persons subjected to  it, five only refused to confess--a very satisfactory result for the  inventor.    Lastly comes the torture of the rope and pulley, the most in vogue of  all, and known in other Latin countries as the strappado.    It was divided into three degrees of intensity--the slight, the severe,  and the very severe.    The first, or slight torture, which consisted mainly in the  apprehensions it caused, comprised the threat of severe torture,  introduction into the torture chamber, stripping, and the tying of the  rope in readiness for its appliance. To increase the terror these  preliminaries excited, a pang of physical pain was added by tightening a  cord round the wrists. This often sufficed to extract a confession from  women or men of highly strung nerves.    The second degree, or severe torture, consisted in fastening the  sufferer, stripped naked, and his hands tied behind his back, by the  wrists to one end of a rope passed round a pulley bolted into the  vaulted ceiling, the other end being attached to a windlass, by turning  which he could be hoisted, into the air, and dropped again, either  slowly or with a jerk, as ordered by the judge. The suspension generally  lasted during the recital of a Pater Noster, an Ave Maria, or a  Miserere; if the accused persisted in his denial, it was doubled. This  second degree, the last of the ordinary torture, was put in practice  when the crime appeared reasonably probable but was not absolutely  proved.    The third, or very severe, the first of the extraordinary forms of  torture, was so called when the sufferer, having hung suspended by the  wrists, for sometimes a whole hour, was swung about by the executioner,  either like the pendulum of a clock, or by elevating him with the  windlass and dropping him to within a foot or two of the ground. If he  stood this torture, a thing almost unheard of, seeing that it cut the  flesh of the wrist to the bone and dislocated the limbs, weights were  attached to the feet, thus doubling the torture. This last form of  torture was only applied when an atrocious crime had been proved to have  been committed upon a sacred person, such as a priest, a cardinal, a  prince, or an eminent and learned man.    Having seen that Beatrice was sentenced to the torture ordinary and  extraordinary, and having explained the nature of these tortures, we  proceed to quote the official report:--    \"And as in reply to every question she would confess nothing, we caused  her to be taken by two officers and led from the prison to the torture  chamber, where the torturer was in attendance; there, after cutting off  her hair, he made her sit on a small stool, undressed her, pulled off  her shoes, tied her hands behind her back, fastened them to a rope  passed over a pulley bolted into the ceiling of the aforesaid chamber,  and wound up at the other end by a four lever windlass, worked by two  men.\"    \"Before hoisting her from the ground we again interrogated her touching  the aforesaid parricide; but notwithstanding the confessions of her  brother and her stepmother, which were again produced, bearing their  signatures, she persisted in denying everything, saying, 'Haul me about  and do what you like with me; I have spoken the truth, and will tell you  nothing else, even if I were torn to pieces.'    \"Upon this we had her hoisted in the air by the wrists to the height of  about two feet from the ground, while we recited a Pater Noster; and  then again questioned her as to the facts and circumstances of the  aforesaid parricide; but she would make no further answer, only saying,  'You are killing me! You are killing me!'    \"We then raised her to the elevation of four feet, and began an Ave  Maria. But before our prayer was half finished she fainted away; or  pretended to do so.    \"We caused a bucketful of water to be thrown over her head; feeling its  coolness, she recovered consciousness, and cried, 'My God! I am dead!  You are killing me! My God!' But this was all she would say.    \"We then raised her higher still, and recited a Miserere, during which,  instead of joining in the prayer, she shook convulsively and cried  several times, 'My God! My God!'    \"Again questioned as to the aforesaid parricide, she would confess  nothing, saying only that she was innocent, and then again fainted away.    \"We caused more water to be thrown over her; then she recovered her  senses, opened her eyes, and cried, 'O cursed executioners! You are  killing me! You are killing me!' But nothing more would she say.    \"Seeing which, and that she persisted in her denial, we ordered the  torturer to proceed to the torture by jerks.    \"He accordingly hoisted her ten feet from the ground, and when there we  enjoined her to tell the truth; but whether she would not or could not  speak, she answered only by a motion of the head indicating that she  could say nothing.    \"Seeing which, we made a sign to the executioner, to let go the rope,  and she fell with all her weight from the height of ten feet to that of  two feet; her arms, from the shock, were dislocated from their sockets;  she uttered a loud cry, and swooned away.    \"We again caused water to be dashed in her face; she returned to  herself, and again cried out, 'Infamous assassins! You are killing me;  but were you to tear out my arms, I would tell you nothing else.'    \"Upon this, we ordered a weight of fifty pounds to be fastened to her  feet. But at this moment the door opened, and many voices cried,  'Enough! Enough! Do not torture her any more!'\"    These voices were those of Giacomo, Bernardo, and Lucrezia Petroni. The  judges, perceiving the obstinacy of Beatrice, had ordered that the  accused, who had been separated for five months, should be confronted.    They advanced into the torture chamber, and seeing Beatrice hanging by  the wrists, her arms disjointed, and covered with blood, Giacomo cried  out:--    \"The sin is committed; nothing further remains but to save our souls by  repentance, undergo death courageously, and not suffer you to be thus  tortured.\"    Then said Beatrice, shaking her head as if to cast off grief--    \"Do you then wish to die? Since you wish it, be it so.\"    Then turning to the officers:--    \"Untie me,\" said she, \"read the examination to me; and what I have to  confess, I will confess; what I have to deny, I will deny.\"    Beatrice was then lowered and untied; a barber reduced the dislocation  of her arms in the usual manner; the examination was read over to her,  and, as she had promised, she made a full confession.    After this confession, at the request of the two brothers, they were all  confined in the same prison; but the next day Giacomo and Bernardo were  taken to the cells of Tordinona; as for the women, they remained where  they were.    The pope was so horrified on reading the particulars of the crime  contained in the confessions, that he ordered the culprits to be dragged  by wild horses through the streets of Rome. But so barbarous a sentence  shocked the public mind, so much so that many persons of princely rank  petitioned the Holy Father on their knees, imploring him to reconsider  his decree, or at least allow the accused to be heard in their defence.    \"Tell me,\" replied Clement VIII, \"did they give their unhappy father  time to be heard in his own defence, when they slew him in so merciless "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#5)"],[1,"his various chateaux and setting his domestic  establishment, which had been destroyed during the war, again on foot,  only 60,000 livres. This treaty was signed on July 27th, 1629.    The Duc de Richelieu, to whom no sacrifice was too great in order to  attain his ends, had at last reached the goal, but the peace cost him  nearly 40,000,000 livres; on the other hand, Saintonge, Poitou, and  Languedoc had submitted, and the chiefs of the houses of La Tremouille,  Conde, Bouillon, Rohan, and Soubise had came to terms with him;  organised armed opposition had disappeared, and the lofty manner of  viewing matters natural to the cardinal duke prevented him from noticing  private enmity. He therefore left Nimes free to manage her local affairs  as she pleased, and very soon the old order, or rather disorder, reigned  once more within her walls. At last Richelieu died, and Louis XIII soon  followed him, and the long minority of his successor, with its  embarrassments, left to Catholics and Protestants in the South more  complete liberty than ever to carry on the great duel which down to our  own days has never ceased.    But from this period, each flux and reflux bears more and more the  peculiar character of the party which for the moment is triumphant; when  the Protestants get the upper hand, their vengeance is marked by  brutality and rage; when the Catholics are victorious, the retaliation  is full of hypocrisy and greed. The Protestants pull down churches and  monasteries, expel the monks, burn the crucifixes, take the body of some  criminal from the gallows, nail it on a cross, pierce its side, put a  crown of thorns round its temples and set it up in the market-place--an  effigy of Jesus on Calvary. The Catholics levy contributions, take back  what they had been deprived of, exact indemnities, and although ruined  by each reverse, are richer than ever after each victory. The  Protestants act in the light of day, melting down the church bells to  make cannon to the sound of the drum, violate agreements, warm  themselves with wood taken from the houses of the cathedral clergy,  affix their theses to the cathedral doors, beat the priests who carry  the Holy Sacrament to the dying, and, to crown all other insults, turn  churches into slaughter-houses and sewers.    The Catholics, on the contrary, march at night, and, slipping in at the  gates which have been left ajar for them, make their bishop president of  the Council, put Jesuits at the head of the college, buy converts with  money from the treasury, and as they always have influence at court,  begin by excluding the Calvinists from favour, hoping soon to deprive  them of justice.    At last, on the 31st of December, 1657, a final struggle took place, in  which the Protestants were overcome, and were only saved from  destruction because from the other side of the Channel, Cromwell exerted  himself in their favour, writing with his own hand at the end of a  despatch relative to the affairs of Austria, \"I Learn that there have  been popular disturbances in a town of Languedoc called Nimes, and I beg  that order may be restored with as much mildness as possible, and  without shedding of blood.\" As, fortunately for the Protestants, Mazarin  had need of Cromwell at that moment, torture was forbidden, and nothing  allowed but annoyances of all kinds. These henceforward were not only  innumerable, but went on without a pause: the Catholics, faithful to  their system of constant encroachment, kept up an incessant persecution,  in which they were soon encouraged by the numerous ordinances issued by  Louis XIV. The grandson of Henri IV could not so far forget all ordinary  respect as to destroy at once the Edict of Nantes, but he tore off  clause after clause.    In 1630--that is, a year after the peace with Rohan had been signed in  the preceding reign--Chalons-sur-Saone had resolved that no Protestant  should be allowed to take any part in the manufactures of the town.    In 1643, six months after the accession of Louis XIV, the laundresses of  Paris made a rule that the wives and daughters of Protestants were  unworthy to be admitted to the freedom of their respectable guild.    In 1654, just one year after he had attained his majority, Louis XIV  consented to the imposition of a tax on the town of Nimes of 4000 francs  towards the support of the Catholic and the Protestant hospitals; and  instead of allowing each party to contribute to the support of its own  hospital, the money was raised in one sum, so that, of the money paid by  the Protestants, who were twice as numerous as the Catholics, two-sixths  went to their enemies. On August 9th of the same year a decree of the  Council ordered that all the artisan consuls should be Catholics; on the  16th September another decree forbade Protestants to send deputations to  the king; lastly, on the 20th of December, a further decree declared  that all hospitals should be administered by Catholic consuls alone.    In 1662 Protestants were commanded to bury their dead either at dawn or  after dusk, and a special clause of the decree fixed the number of  persons who might attend a funeral at ten only.    In 1663 the Council of State issued decrees prohibiting the practice of  their religion by the Reformers in one hundred and forty-two communes in  the dioceses of Nimes, Uzes, and Mendes; and ordering the demolition of  their meetinghouses.    In 1664 this regulation was extended to the meeting-houses of Alencon  and Montauban, as Well as their small place of worship in Nimes. On the  17th July of the same year the Parliament of Rouen forbade the  master-mercers to engage any more Protestant workmen or apprentices when  the number already employed had reached the proportion of one  Protestant, to fifteen Catholics; on the 24th of the same month the  Council of State declared all certificates of mastership held by a  Protestant invalid from whatever source derived; and in October reduced  to two the number of Protestants who might be employed at the mint.    In 1665 the regulation imposed on the mercers was extended to the  goldsmiths.    In 1666 a royal declaration, revising the decrees of Parliament, was  published, and Article 31 provided that the offices of clerk to the  consulates, or secretary to a guild of watchmakers, or porter in a  municipal building, could only be held by Catholics; while in Article 33  it was ordained that when a procession carrying the Host passed a place  of worship belonging to the so-called Reformers, the worshippers should  stop their psalm-singing till the procession had gone by; and lastly, in  Article 34 it was enacted that the houses and other buildings belonging  to those who were of the Reformed religion might, at the pleasure of the  town authorities, be draped with cloth or otherwise decorated on any  religious Catholic festival.    In 1669 the Chambers appointed by the Edict of Nantes in the Parliaments  of Rouen and Paris were suppressed, as well as the articled clerkships  connected therewith, and the clerkships in the Record Office; and in  August of the same year, when the emigration of Protestants was just  beginning, an edict was issued, of which the following is a clause:    \"Whereas many of our subjects have gone to foreign countries, where they  continue to follow their various trades and occupations, even working as  shipwrights, or taking service as sailors, till at length they feel at  home and determine never to return to France, marrying abroad and  acquiring property of every description: We hereby forbid any member of  the so-called Reformed Church to leave this kingdom without our  permission, and we command those who have already left France to return  forthwith within her boundaries.\"    In 1670 the king excluded physicians of the Reformed faith from the  office of dean of the college of Rouen, and allowed only two Protestant  doctors within its precincts. In 1671 a decree was published commanding  the arms of France to be removed from all the places of worship  belonging to the pretended Reformers. In 1680 a proclamation from the  king closed the profession of midwife to women of the Reformed faith. In  1681 those who renounced the Protestant religion were exempted for two  years from all contributions towards the support of soldiers sent to  their town, and were for the same period relieved from the duty of  giving them board and lodging. In the same year the college of Sedan was  closed--the only college remaining in the entire kingdom at which  Calvinist children could receive instruction. In 1682 the king commanded  Protestant notaries; procurators, ushers, and serjeants to lay down  their offices, declaring them unfit for such professions; and in  September of the same year three months only were allowed them for the  sale of the reversion of the said offices. In 1684 the Council of State  extended the preceding regulations to those Protestants holding the  title of honorary secretary to the king, and in August of the same year  Protestants were declared incapable of serving on a jury of experts.    In 1685 the provost of merchants in Paris ordered all Protestant  privileged merchants in that city to sell their privileges within a  month. And in October of the same year the long series of persecutions,  of which we have omitted many, reached its culminating point--the:  Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Henri IV, who foresaw this result,  had hoped that it would have occurred in another manner, so that his  co-religionists would have been able to retain their fortresses; but  what was actually done was that the strong places were first taken away,  and then came the Revocation; after which the Calvinists found  themselves completely at the mercy of their mortal enemies.    From 1669, when Louis first threatened to aim a fatal blow at the civil  rights of the Huguenots, by abolishing the equal partition of the  Chambers between the two parties,"]]]
