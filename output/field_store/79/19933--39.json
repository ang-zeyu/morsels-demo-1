Such productions  certainly do not justify the application of the epithet \"theological\" to  Jewish literature. Solomon ben Sakbel composes a satiric romance in the  Makamat[12] form, describing the varied adventures of Asher ben Yehuda,  another Don Quixote; Berachya Hanakdan puts into Hebrew the fables of  AEsop and Lokman, furnishing La Fontaine with some of his material;  Abraham ibn Sahl receives from the Arabs, certainly not noted for  liberality, ten goldpieces for each of his love-songs; Santob de Carrion  is a beloved Spanish bard, bold enough to tell unpleasant truths unto a  king; Joseph ibn Sabara writes a humorous romance; Yehuda Sabbatai, epic  satires, \"The War of Wealth and Wisdom,\" and \"A Gift from a Misogynist,\"  and unnamed authors, \"Truth's Campaign,\" and \"Praise of Women.\"    A satirist of more than ordinary gifts was the Italian Kalonymos, whose  \"Touchstone,\" like Ibn Chasdai's Makamat, \"The Prince and the Dervish,\"  has been translated into German. Contemporaneous with them was Suesskind  von Trimberg, the Suabian minnesinger, and Samson Pnie, of Strasburg,  who helped the German poets continue _Parzival_, while later on, in  Italy, Moses Rieti composed \"The Paradise\" in Hebrew _terza-rima_.    In the decadence of Jewish literature, the most prominent figure is  Immanuel ben Solomon, or Manoello, as the Italians call him. Critics  think him the precursor of Boccaccio, and history knows him as the  friend of Dante, whose _Divina Commedia_ he travestied in Hebrew. The  author of the first Hebrew sonnet and of the first Hebrew novel, he was  a talented writer, but as frivolous as talented.    This is the development of Jewish poetry during its great period. In  other departments of literature, in philosophy, in theology, in ethics,  in Bible exegesis, the race is equally prolific in minds of the first  order. Glancing back for a moment, our eye is arrested by Moses  Maimonides, the great systematizer of the Jewish Law, and the connecting  link between scholasticism and the Greek-Arabic development of the  Aristotelian system. Before his time Bechai ibn Pakuda and Joseph ibn  Zadik had entered upon theosophic speculations with the object of  harmonizing Arabic and Greek philosophy, and in the age immediately  preceding that of Maimonides, Abraham ibn Daud, a writer of surprisingly  liberal views, had undertaken, in \"The Highest Faith,\" the task of  reconciling faith with philosophy. At the same time rationalistic Bible  exegesis was begun by Abraham ibn Ezra, an acute but reckless  controversialist. Orthodox interpretations of the Bible had, before him,  been taught in France by Rashi (Solomon Yitschaki) and Samuel ben Meir,  and continued by German rabbis, who, at the same time, were preachers of  morality--a noteworthy phenomenon in a persecuted tribe. \"How pure and  strong its ethical principles were is shown by its religious poetry as  well as by its practical Law. What pervades the poetry as a high ideal,  in the application of the Law becomes demonstrable reality. The wrapt  enthusiasm in the hymns of Samuel the Pious and other poets is embodied,  lives, in the rulings of Yehuda Hakohen, Solomon Yitschaki, and Jacob  ben Meir; in the legal opinions of Isaac ben Abraham, Eliezer ha-Levi,  Isaac ben Moses, Meir ben Baruch, and their successors, and in the  codices of Eliezer of Metz and Moses de Coucy. A German professor[13] of  a hundred years ago, after glancing through some few Jewish writings,  exclaimed, in a tone of condescending approval: 'Christians of that time  could scarcely have been expected to enjoin such high moral principles  as this Jew wrote down and bequeathed to his brethren in faith!'\"    Jewish literature in this and the next period consists largely of  theological discussions and of commentaries on the Talmud produced by  the hundred. It would be idle to name even the most prominent authors;  their works belong to the history of theologic science, and rarely had a  determining influence upon the development of genuine literature.    We must also pass over in silence the numerous Jewish physicians and  medical writers; but it must be remembered that they, too, belong to  Jewish literature. The most marvellous characteristic of this literature  is that in it the Jewish race has registered each step of its  development. \"All things learned, gathered, obtained, on its journeyings  hither and thither--Greek philosophy and Arabic, as well as Latin  scholasticism--all deposited themselves in layers about the Bible, so  stamping later Jewish literature with an individuality that gave it an  unique place among the literatures of the world.\"    The travellers, however, must be mentioned by name. Their itineraries  were wholly dedicated to the interests of their co-religionists. The  first of the line is Eldad, the narrator of a sort of Hebrew Odyssey.  Benjamin of Tudela and Petachya of Ratisbon are deserving of more  confidence as veracious chroniclers, and their descriptions, together  with Charisi's, complete the Jewish library of travels of those early  days, unless, with Steinschneider, we consider, as we truly may, the  majority of Jewish authors under this head. For Jewish writers a hard,  necessitous lot has ever been a storm wind, tossing them hither and  thither, and blowing the seeds of knowledge over all lands. Withal  learning proved an enveloping, protecting cloak to these mendicant and  pilgrim authors. The dispersion of the Jews, their international  commerce, and the desire to maintain their academies, stimulated a love  for travel, made frequent journeyings a necessity, indeed. In this way  only can we account for the extraordinarily rapid spread of Jewish  literature in the middle ages. The student of those times often chances  across a rabbi, who this day teaches, lectures, writes in Candia,  to-morrow in Rome, next year in Prague or Cracow, and so Jewish  literature is the \"wandering Jew\" among the world's literatures.    The fourth period, the Augustan age of our literature, closes with a  jarring discord--the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, their second  home, in which they had seen ministers, princes, professors, and poets  rise from their ranks. The scene of literary activity changes: France,  Italy, but chiefly the Slavonic East, are pushed into the foreground. It  is not a salutary change; it ushers in three centuries of decay and  stagnation in literary endeavor. The sum of the efforts is indicated by  the name of the period, the Rabbinical, for its chief work was the  development and fixation of Rabbinism.    Decadence did not set in immediately. Certain beneficent forces, either  continuing in action from the former period, or arising out of the new  concatenation of circumstances, were in operation: Jewish exiles from  Spain carried their culture to the asylums hospitably offered them in  the Orient and a few of the European countries, notably Holland; the art  of printing was spreading, the first presses in Italy bringing out  Jewish works; and the sun of humanism and of the Reformation was rising  and shedding solitary rays of its effulgence on the Jewish minds then at  work.    Among the noteworthy authors standing between the two periods and  belonging to both, the most prominent is Nachmanides, a pious and  learned Bible scholar. With logical force and critical candor he entered  into the great conflict between science and faith, then dividing the  Jewish world into two camps, with Maimonides' works as their shibboleth.  The Aristotelian philosophy was no longer satisfying. Minds and hearts  were yearning for a new revelation, and in default thereof steeping  themselves in mystical speculations. A voluminous theosophic literature  sprang up. The _Zohar_, the Bible of mysticism, was circulated, its  authorship being fastened upon a rabbi of olden days. It is altogether  probable that the real author was living at the time; many think that it  was Moses de Leon. The liberal party counted in its ranks the two  distinguished families of Tibbon and Kimchi, the former famed as  successful translators, the latter as grammarians. Their best known  representatives were Judah ibn Tibbon and David Kimchi. Curiously  enough, the will of the former contains, in unmistakable terms, the  opinion that \"Property is theft,\" anticipating Proudhon, who, had he  known it, would have seen in its early enunciation additional testimony  to its truth. The liberal faction was also supported by Jacob ben  Abba-Mari, the friend of Frederick II. and Michael Scotus. Abba-Mari  lived at the German emperor's court at Naples, and quoted him in his  commentary upon the Bible as an exegete. Besides there were among the  Maimunists, or rationalists, Levi ben Abraham, an extraordinarily  liberal man; Shemtob Palquera, one of the most learned Jews of his  century, and Yedaya Penini, a philosopher and pessimistic poet, whose  \"Contemplation of the World\" was translated by Mendelssohn, and praised  by Lessing and Goethe. Despite this array of talent, the opponents were  stronger, the most representative partisan being the Talmudist Solomon  ben Aderet.    At the same time disputations about the Talmud, ending with its public  burning at Paris, were carried on with the Christian clergy. The other  literary current of the age is designated by the word Kabbala, which  held many of the finest and noblest minds captive to its witchery. The  Kabbala is unquestionably a continuation of earlier theosophic  inquiries. Its chief doctrines have been stated by a thorough student of  our literature: All that exists originates in God, the source of light  eternal. He Himself can be known only through His manifestations. He is  without beginning, and veiled in mystery, or, He is nothing, because the  whole of creation has developed from nothing.

They stole up within five paces of the lion, which still held its  ground.  The only respect it showed to their presence was to leave off  feeding and crouch over the body of the horse, as though preparing to  spring upon them.    \"Now,\" whispered Hendrik, \"shall we fire?\"    \"Yes, yes!--now!\"    Both pulled trigger at the same time, the two shots making but one  report.    Instinctively each threw himself from the direct line of the creature's  deadly leap.  This was done at the moment of firing; and the lion,  uttering a terrific roar, launched itself towards them, and fell heavily  between the two, having leaped a distance of full twenty feet.  That  effort was its last, for it was unable to rise again.    Without taking the trouble to ascertain whether the fierce brute had  been killed outright, they turned their attention to the carcass.    The horse was Arend's, but there was not the slightest trace of the  rider.  Whatever had been his fate, there was no sign of his having been  killed along with his horse.  There was still a hope that he had made  his escape, though the finding of the horse only added to their  apprehensions.    \"Let us find out,\" counselled Hendrik, \"whether the horse was killed  where it is now lying, or whether it has been dragged hither by the  lion.\"    After examining the ground, Congo declared that the horse had been  killed upon the spot, and by the lion.    This was strange enough.    On a further examination of the sign, it was found that one of the  horse's legs was entangled in the rein of the bridle.  This explained  the circumstance to some extent, otherwise it would have been difficult  to understand how so swift an animal as a horse should have allowed  itself to be overtaken upon an open plain.    \"So much the better,\" said Groot Willem.  \"Arend never reached this  place along with his horse.\"    \"That's true,\" answered Hendrik, \"and our next move will be to find out  where he parted from his saddle.\"    \"Let us go back,\" said Willem, \"and more carefully examine the tracks.\"    During this conversation, the hunters had reloaded their rifles, and now  remounted for the purpose of riding back.    \"Baas Willem,\" suggested Congo, \"let Spoor'em try 'bout here little  more.\"    This suggestion was adopted, and Congo, setting on the hound, proceeded  to describe a larger circle around the spot.    After reaching a part of the plain where they had not yet been, the  Kaffir called out to them to come to him.    They rode up, and were again shown the spoor of Arend's horse leading  away from where its carcass was now lying, and in the opposite direction  from the camp.    It was evident that the horse had been farther off than the spot where  its remains now rested.  It had probably lost its rider beyond, and was  on its return to the camp when killed by the lion.    Once more Spoor'em started along the track, Congo keeping close to his  tail, the two horsemen riding anxiously after.    But we must return to the camp, and follow the trail of the lost hunter  by a means more sure than even the keen scent of Spoor'em.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    THE LOST HUNTER.    As Arend came up to the horse that had wandered from the camp, the  animal had arrived at the edge of an extensive thicket, and was  apparently determined upon straying still farther.  To avoid being  caught or driven back, it rushed in among trees, taking a path or trace  made by wild animals.    Arend followed.    The path was too narrow to allow of his heading the stray; and,  apprehensive of losing it altogether, the youth followed on in hopes of  coming to a wider track, where he might have a chance of passing the  runaway and turning it towards the camp.    This hope seemed about to be realised, as the truant emerged from the  thicket and entered upon an open plain clothed with low heath,--the  _Erica vestila_, loaded with white blossoms.    The hunter was no longer obliged to follow upon the heels of the  runaway,--the horse; and spurring his own steed, he made an attempt to  get past it.  But the horse, perhaps inspired by a recollection of the  pack-saddle and its heavy load, broke off into a gallop.    Arend followed, increasing his own speed in like proportion.  When  nearly across the plain, the runaway suddenly stopped and then bolted  off at right angles to the course it had been hitherto pursuing.    Arend was astonished, but soon discovered the cause of this eccentric  action, in the presence of a huge black rhinoceros,--the borele--which  was making a straight course across the plain, as if on its way to the  river.    The runaway horse had shied out of its way; and it would have been well  for the horseman if he had shown himself equally discreet.  But Arend  Von Wyk was a hunter,--and an officer of the Cape Militia,--and as the  borele passed by him, presenting a fine opportunity for a shot, he could  not resist the temptation to give it one.    Pulling up his horse, or rather trying to do so, for the animal was  restive in the presence of such danger, he fired.  The shot produced a  result that was neither expected nor desired.  With a roar like the  bellowing of an angry bull, the monster turned and charged straight  towards the horseman.    Arend was obliged to seek safety in flight, while the borele pursued in  a manner that told of its being wounded, but not incapacitated from  seeking revenge.    At the commencement of the chase, there was but a very short distance  between pursuer and pursued; and in place of suddenly turning out of the  track, and allowing the monster to pass by him,--which he should have  done, knowing the defect of vision natural to the rhinoceros,--the young  hunter continued on in a straight line, all the while employed in  reloading his rifle.    His mistake did not originate in any want of knowledge, or presence of  mind, but rather from carelessness and an unworthy estimate of the  abilities of the borele to overtake him.  He had long been a successful  hunter, and success too often begets that over-confidence which leads to  many a mischance, that the more cautious sportsman will avoid.    Suddenly he found his flight arrested by the thick scrub of thorny  bushes, known in South Africa as the \"wait a bits\", and the horse he was  riding did wait a bit,--and so long that the borele was soon close upon  his heels.    There was now neither time nor room to turn either to the right or left.    The rifle was at length loaded, but there would have been but little  chance of killing the rhinoceros by a single shot, especially with such  uncertain aim as could have been taken from the back of a frightened  horse.    Arend, therefore, threw himself from the saddle.  He had a twofold  purpose in doing so.  His aim would be more correct, and there was the  chance of the borele keeping on after the horse, and leaving him an  undisturbed spectator of the chase.    The field of view embraced by the eyes of a rhinoceros is not large;  but, unfortunately for the hunter, as the frightened horse fled from his  side, it was he himself that came within the circumscribed circle of the  borele's vision.    Hastily raising the rifle to his shoulder he fired at the advancing  enemy, and then fled towards a clump of trees that chanced to be near  by.    He could hear the heavy tread of the rhinoceros as it followed close  upon his heels.  It seemed to shake the earth.  Closer and closer he  heard it, so near that he dared not stop to look around.  He fancied he  could feel the breath of the monster blowing upon his back.  His only  chance was to make a sudden deviation from his course, and leave the  borele to pass on in its impetuous charge.  This he did, turning sharply  to the right, when he saw that he had just escaped being elevated upon  the creature's horn.    This manoeuvre enabled him to gain some distance as he started off in  the new direction.  But it was not long maintained; for the borele was  again in hot pursuit, without any show of fatigue; while the tremendous  exertions he had himself been making rendered him incapable of  continuing his flight much longer.  He had just sufficient strength left  to avoid an immediate encounter by taking one more turn, when,  fortunately, he saw before him the trunk of a large baobab-tree lying  prostrate along the ground.  It had been blown down by some mighty  storm, and lay resting upon its roots at one end, and its shivered  branches at the other, so as to leave a space of about two feet between  its trunk and the ground.    Suddenly throwing himself down, Arend glided under the tree, just in  time to escape the long horn, whose point had again come in close  proximity with his posterior.    The hunter had now time to recover his breath, and, to some extent, his  confidence.  He saw that the fallen tree would protect him.  Even should  the rhinoceros come round to the other side, he would only have to roll  back again to place himself beyond the reach of its terrible horn.  The  space below was ample enough to enable him to pass through, but too  small for the body of a borele.  By creeping back and forward he could  always place himself in safety.  And this was just what he had to do;  for the enraged monster, on seeing him on the other side, immediately  ran round the roots, and renewed the attack.    This course of action was several times repeated before the young hunter  was allowed much time for reflection.  He was in hopes that the brute  would get tired of the useless charges it was making and either go away  itself, or give him the opportunity.    In this hope he was doomed to disappointment.  The animal, exasperated  with the wounds it had received, appeared implacable; and for more than  an hour it kept running around the tree in vain attempts to get at him.  As he had very little trouble in avoiding it, there was plenty of  opportunity for reflection; and he passed the"]]]
