Enlarged negatives are very easily made with the apparatus described. A  contact positive can be made, preferably on carbon transparency tissue,  and from this the enlargement made, or an enlarged positive made first,  and from this a contact negative. The latter plan is preferable, since it  admits of retouching on both positive and negative. Slow plates should be  used throughout. For those who do not care to go to the expense of  experimenting with large plates, I would suggest that good contact  positives be first made and from these negatives on bromide paper,  _Standard A_, _soft_. These negatives are treated as already described.  The best positive for this purpose is a thin one with full gradations of  tone from clear high light to deep shadow, without veil or fog, but free  from any suspicion of flatness.          CHAPTER V    ENLARGING BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT      The apparatus for enlarging with artificial light is, as has been stated,  more expensive than that for use with daylight. The negative box and  screen, however, remain as given. But we need in addition two extra  pieces, a light-box and a pair of condensing lenses.    The form of light-box presupposes the choice of illuminant, and in this  there is a wide range. Suffice it to say that a kerosene lamp with one or  more one-and-a-half inch burners will be found suitable for very small  work or weak negatives. For larger work or stronger negatives a stronger  light will be needed.    Of these, the first in point of strength is the arc-light, which is too  strong for ordinary negatives to be enlarged not more than fourfold on  ordinary bromide paper. Used with any of the slower papers it will be  found very serviceable and satisfactory. Next comes the lime-light, which  has pretty much the same advantages and disadvantages. After these come  acetylene, a gas giving an intense light of high actinic power. This is  within the reach of nearly all, as a first-class generator costs only  about twelve dollars, and the uses of the gas are manifold. The same  generators and burners can be used with a projecting lantern and will be  found far more satisfactory than oil. Acetylene burners can be had in  various sizes, ranging in power from thirty to several hundred  candle-power. The carbide from which the gas is generated is not expensive  and costs only a few cents each time the machine is loaded. By an  adjustment attached to the generator the gas is kept at a constant  pressure, and hence the light is unusually steady. All in all this light  has many advantages. After it in strength comes the Welsbach burner,  suitable for those having gas in the house. After this comes the ordinary  gas-burner, and then oil. The reader, knowing now what will be required of  his light, can take his choice.    Perhaps the simplest form of light-box is where the light is placed in one  room and the enlarging done in an adjoining one, the light being admitted  through a suitable opening. This prevents the possibility of stray light  reaching the paper and is productive of no additional heat in a room  presumably already hot enough.    If this is not feasible a light-box must be constructed. As these vary so  much in material and design, and must be altered with different forms of  light in use, I will merely state the requirements. First of these is that  it must be light-tight, and second, that it must have adequate ventilation  and be fire-proof. Following these in importance, there should be a simple  arrangement for looking at the light from time to time to see that it is  burning properly and some means for readily attending to it if it is not.    Having the light-box, the burners must be placed in it properly. Here the  shortest way out of the difficulty is to go to an expert. If electricity  is used go to an electrical supply house; if gas, go to a gas-fitter. As  will be seen later the flame itself must be placed in a certain relation  to other portions of the apparatus, and provision must be made  accordingly.    In looking over the magazines and annuals we will now and then see some  new method given for illuminating evenly the back of a negative in  enlarging or reduction. The most of these the writer has tried, but he has  never found one of them which could be relied upon to give even reasonable  satisfaction. If the light is apparently evenly diffused it is too weak.  If strong enough it is not evenly diffused. Hence I will recommend nothing  short of a pair of condensing lenses, as these have been proved by  experience to be satisfactory in every respect if properly handled and  cared for. The diameter of these must be slightly greater than the  diagonal of the largest negative from which enlargements are to be made.  These can be bought in pairs, mounted or unmounted, at about the following  prices:      ---------+-----------------+----------------+------------------    Diameter | Focus           | Pair of Lenses | Per Single Lens    Inches   | Inches          | Mounted        | Unmounted    ---------+-----------------+----------------+------------------      4      |  5-1/2 or 6-1/2 |   $ 4.00       |  $ 1.25      4-1/2  |  5-1/2 or 6-1/2 |     6.00       |    1.50      5      |  6-1/2          |     7.50       |    1.75      6      |  8              |    12.00       |    3.00      8      | 12              |    32.00       |    7.50      9      | 14              |    40.00       |   10.00    ---------+-----------------+----------------+------------------    The prices asked for condensers vary considerably in different  price-lists. They can often be had at second-hand at a decided saving of  expense.    If it is desired to save the additional cost of the mounted condensing  lenses, they can be comparatively easily mounted by anyone at all familiar  with tools in the following manner:    A piece of quarter-inch pine or poplar is cut to a square about an inch  larger than the diameter of the lenses. In the center of this is sawed out  a circular opening the exact size of the lens. In another board of the  same dimensions is cut a circle a quarter of an inch less in diameter.  These boards are placed together with the grain running in opposite  directions, to prevent warping, and the lens kept in place by a wire bent  in a circle and clamped in place so as to hold the lens, or other similar  arrangement. See Fig. 8. The other lens is mounted in the same way. The  two are mounted with their convex sides facing each other and a slight  distance apart. It is better to place between them a thin sheet of finely  ground glass, as this overcomes the bad effects of slight flaws in the  lenses, which are not uncommon. The combination is then boxed up.    [Illustration: Fig. 8]    Having now our light-box, condensers, negative box, camera and screen,  they are next arranged in the order shown by Fig. 9. A long table  especially constructed for the purpose makes the best base for this  purpose.    In putting the apparatus together there are several points to be noticed.  First, the planes of the lenses, negative, projecting lenses and screen  must all be parallel; second, the centers of all these should be in a  single straight line, and third, either the light or the condensers should  be so mounted as to easily slide backward or forward, since every time the  projecting lens is racked backward or forward it necessitates a  corresponding motion of the condensers to or from the light.    [Illustration: Fig. 9]    In constructing the apparatus, for use with condensers and artificial  light, the same provision should be made in the negative box for inserting  a piece of colored or ground glass as was made in the daylight apparatus.  When the diameter of the condensers is but little greater than the  diagonal of the negative it will be necessary to have the latter quite  close to the former, as the cone of light from the condensers has its apex  at the lens, and hence if the negative in such a case is at a distance  from the condensers the corners will receive no light. Reference to Fig. 9  will show this plainly. For this and other reasons it is always best to  have the condensers of ample size for a given negative. In fact, before  beginning to make enlargements the worker should work with one good  negative until he finds out exactly what light-intensity is best suited to  it. This will then serve as a standard for all other negatives of the same  general grade, and variations of the light can be made as required for  particular negatives, or where the extent of enlargement is materially  changed for various purposes.    In using the daylight apparatus, which we will now consider, the negative  is placed in the holder opposite the center of the ground-glass, upside  down and facing into the work room. The room is darkened and lens  uncapped. An image more or less blurred will appear on the screen. If the  enlarged picture is to be only slightly larger than the negative, the lens  must be racked out until its distance from the negative is but little less  than its distance from the screen. To make the enlargement greater we  simply rack back the lens and move the screen further off. There are  tables which show exactly the distance which the lens must be from the  negative and screen in order to get an enlargement of a given size: The  table here inserted covers the ordinary requirements and may be of service  in constructing the apparatus:      TIMES OF ENLARGEMENT      Total distances from the negative, in inches.      -------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------     Times of    |       2       |        3        |        4        |        6     Enlargement |               |                 |                 |    -------------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------     Focus of    | To    | To    | To     | To     |"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24647"],[0,"The Standard Operaglass (#5)"],[1,"ida's  father, who is to stay with his daughter.  Pharaoh then gives Amneris  to Radames as a recompense for his services.    In the third act Amonasro has discovered the mutual love of his  daughter and Radames and resolves to make use of it.  While Amneris  prays in the temple that her bridegroom may give his whole heart to  her, Amonasro bids his daughter discover the secret of the Egyptian  warplans from her lover.  Amonasro hides himself, and Aida has an  interview with Radames, in which he reveals all to her.  She persuades  him to fly with her, when Amonasro shows himself, telling him that he  has heard all and confessing that he is the Ethiopian King.  While they  are speaking, Amneris overtakes and denounces them.  Amonasro {10}  escapes with his daughter, Radames remains in the hand of Ramphis, the  Highpriest.    In the fourth act Radames is visited in his cell by Amneris, who  promises to save him from the awful death of being buried alive, if he  renounces Aida.  But Radames refuses, though she tells him, that Aida  has fled into her country, her father being slain on their flight.    Amneris at length regrets her jealousy and repents, but too late!  Nothing can save Radames, and she is obliged to see him led into his  living tomb.  Amneris curses the priests, who close the subterranean  vaults with a rock.  Radames, preparing himself for death, discovers  Aida by his side.  She has found means to penetrate into his tomb,  resolved to die with her lover.    While she sinks into his arms, Amneris prays outside for Radames' peace  and eternal happiness.          ALESSANDRO STRADELLA.    Romantic Opera in three acts by FLOTOW.    Text after the French by W. FRIEDRICH.      Flotow, who composed this little opera when at Paris in the year 1844,  that is long before his Martha, had the satisfaction of scoring a great  success on the evening of its first representation in Hamburg.  The  pleasant impression then made by its agreeable and lovely melodies has  not faded the less that, after hearing many of our stormy and exciting  modern operas, one often and ardently {11} longs for the restful charm  and guileless pleasure of a piece like this.    The libretto is interesting and touching, without being  over-sensational.    Stradella, the celebrated Venetian singer has fallen in love with  Leonore, ward of a rich Venetian citizen named Bassi.  She returns his  love, but is strictly guarded by her uncle, who wants to marry her  himself.  Stradella succeeds in deceiving Bassi and aided by his friend  carries her off during the Carnival.  In the second act we find the  lovers in a little village near Rome, where a priest unites them for  ever and gives them his benediction.    But Malvolio, a bandit, has sought them by Bassi's orders, and  discovers their refuge.  Entering the villa, where he finds open doors  but no people, he meets with another bandit, in whom he recognizes his  friend Barbarino, also sent as it turns out on the same errand.    They decide to do the business together, that is to say: to kill  Stradella, and to carry his wife back to her guardian.  Under the mask  of pilgrims going to a sacred festival, they find a kindly shelter in  Stradella's house and are won by the latter's fine voice, as well as by  the charm of his noble behaviour, so that they wholly abandon their  evil purpose.    But in the third act Bassi appears, and not finding his order executed,  offers such a large sum of gold to the banditti, that they at length  promise to stab Stradella during his next singing performance.  While  they lie-in-wait for him, Stradella sings the {12} hymn of the Holy  Virgin's clemency towards sinners so touchingly, that his pursuers cast  their swords away and sink on their knees, joining in the refrain.  Full of astonishment Stradella learns of the danger in which he had  been, but in the end he willingly pardons not only the banditti but  also his wife's uncle, who, won over like the ruffians by the power of  Stradella's song, humbly asks for the Singer's friendship, which is  granted to him.    The people lead their favorite in triumph to the festival, which he  helps to glorify with his wondrous voice.          ARMIDA.    Grand heroic Opera in five acts by GLUCK.    Text by PHIL. QUINAULT.      The poet Quinault wrote the libretto of this opera for another  composer, Lully, but almost one hundred years later, Gluck, recognizing  the genuine richness of this French production, availed himself of it  for an opera, the music of which is so sublime, that it will for ever  be considered classic.    The libretto is founded on an episode of Tasso's \"Gerusalemme liberata\".    The scene is laid in Damascus, where during the Crusade of the year  1099, the Crusaders have arrived at the place and gardens of Armida,  the Queen and enchantress.  Rinaldo, the greatest hero in Godfrey of  Bouillon's army, is the only one, who not only does not stoop  [Transcriber's note: stop?] to adore the beautiful Armida, but on the  contrary pursues and hates her.  {13} He has been banished from  Bouillon's presence charged with the rash deed of another knight, who  has not dared to confess his guilt and he now wanders lonely in the  forest.    Warned by a fellow-warrior, Artemidor, to avoid Armida's enchanting  presence he scorns the warning, saying that love for a woman is to him  a thing unknown.  In reality however Armida is already ensnaring him  with her sorcery, he presently hears exquisitely sweet and dreamy  melodies and finding himself in a soft, green valley, he lies down and  falls asleep.    Armida's opportunity has come and she means to stab him, but love  conquers hatred and the dagger sinks from her hand.  She vainly invokes  the furies of hate; none can change her passion for the hero and at  last, ceasing to strive against her tender feelings, she surrenders  herself entirely to him and even succeeds by her charms and her  devotion in enthralling him.  Meanwhile Bouillon has sent two of his  knights, Ubalt and a Danish warrior, to recall Rinaldo to his duty.  They are detained by Armida's witchery; the Danish knight meets a  demon, who has taken his bride's face and tenderly calls him to her,  but Ubalt destroys the charm and both succeed in approaching Rinaldo,  who, his love-dream dissipated by the call of honor, resolves to return  to the army with his companions.  In vain Armida tries to change his  resolution.  In despair she curses him and her love, but being unable  to kill the man she loves, she suffers him to go away and turns her  beautiful place and gardens into a desert.          {14}    DER WAFFENSCHMIED.    (THE ARMORER.)    Comic Opera in three acts by ALBERT LORTZING.    Text by himself.      Though this opera does not equal in value Lortzing's \"Czar and  Zimmermann\", it has nevertheless proved an admirable addition to the  operatic repertory.  It is attractive both on account of the freshness  of its melodies and the popular character of its music and text.    The scene is located in Worms, in the 16th century.  The Count of  Liebenau has fallen in love with Mary, the daughter of a celebrated  armorer, named Stadinger, and in order to win her, he woos her at first  in his own rank as Count, then in the guise of a smith-journeyman,  named Conrad.  Mary, who cannot permit herself to think of love in  connection with a person of such a position as a Count, nevertheless  pities him and at last confesses blushing, that she loves the poor  smith Conrad.  Inwardly triumphant, the Count pretends to be jealous.  But father Stadinger, who more than once showed the door to the Count,  will not accept either of the suitors, the Count standing too high  above him, and his journeyman, Conrad, being too bad a laborer, though  he has once saved Mary's life.    In order to withdraw her from the reach of her lovers, the armorer  resolves to wed his daughter to his second journeyman George, who is no  other than the Count's valet.  Stadinger is determined to {15} present  him as Mary's bridegroom on the occasion of a festival, which is to  take place in the course of the afternoon, and on which Stadinger's  jubilee as master of armorers is to be celebrated.  In vain George  refuses his consent to this proposal.  He is at length obliged to  inform the Count and the latter feigns to assault Stadinger's house.  But it is of no avail; the old citizen, more firm than ever, denies him  his child again, and as George decidedly refuses to marry his daughter,  he gives her at last to Conrad.  Great is Mary's surprise and her  father's wrath, when they discover that the Count and simple Conrad are  one and the same person, but at last the old father yields, and the  lovers receive his benediction.          BALLO IN MASCHERA    or    GUSTAVUS THE THIRD.    Grand historic Opera in five acts by AUBER.    Text by SCRIBE.      This opera has had a curious fate, its historical background having  excited resistance and given rise to scruples.  The murder of a king  was not thought a fit subject for an opera, and so the libretto was  altered and spoilt.    The Italians simply changed the names and the scene of action; Verdi  composed a new opera from the same matter and succeeded admirably;  nevertheless Auber's composition is preferred in Germany, Scribe's  libretto being by far the better, {16} while the music is original and  vivacious as well as full of pleasant harmony and fine instrumentation.    The scene is laid in Stockholm in the year 1792.  Gustavus the Third,  King of Sweden, loves the wife of his friend and counsellor Ankarstroem,  and is loved in return, both struggling vainly against this sinful  passion.  Ankarstroem has detected a plot against the King's life, and  warning him, asks that the traitor be punished, but Gustavus refuses to  listen, trusting in his people and in his friend's fidelity.  His  minister Kaulbart desires him to condemn a sorceress named Arvedson,  who is said to be able at"]]]
