Jefferson, still alive, wrote, \"The Missouri question is the  most portentous which has ever threatened the Union. In the gloomiest  hour of the Revolutionary War I never had apprehensions equal to those  which I feel from this source.\"    To see the bearing of the tremendous question thus raised, we have need  of a retrospect. Property in man is older than history and has been  nearly universal. It cannot be doubted that in an early stage of human  development slavery is a means of furthering civilization. Negro slavery  originated in Africa, spread to Spain before the discovery of America,  to America soon after, and from the Spanish colonies to the English. The  first notice we have of it in English America is that in  1619 a Dutch ship landed twenty blacks at Jamestown for sale. The Dutch  West India Company began importing slaves into Manhattan in 1626. There  were slaves in New England by 1637. Newport was subsequently a great  harbor for slavers. Georgia offered the strongest resistance to the  introduction of the system, but it was soon overcome. Till about 1700,  Virginia had a smaller proportion of slave population than some northern  colonies, and the change later was mostly due to considerations not of  morality but of profit. Anti-slavery cries were indeed heard from an  early period, but they were few and faint. Penn held slaves, though  ordering their emancipation at his death. Whitfield thought slavery to  be of God. But its most culpable abettor was the English Government,  moved by the profits of the slave trade. A Royal African Company, with  the Duke of York, afterward James II., for some time its president, was  formed to monopolize this business, which monarchs and ministries  furthered to the utmost of their power.    Thus the Revolution found slavery in all the colonies, north as well as  south. But it was then, so far south as Virginia, thought to be an evil.  That commonwealth had passed many laws to restrain it, but the King had  commanded the Governor not to assent to any of them. The Legislature,  replying, stigmatized the traffic as inhuman and a threat to the very  existence of the colony. Hostility extended from the trade to slavery  itself. Jefferson was for emancipation with deportation, and trembled  for his country as he reflected upon the wrong of slavery and the  justice of God. Patrick Henry, George Mason, Peyton Randolph,  Washington, Madison, in a word all the great Virginians of the time held  similar views.    The Quakers of Pennsylvania were, however, the most aggressive of  slavery's foes. So early as 1775 a society, the first in America if not  in the world for promoting its abolition, was formed in Pennsylvania. In  1789 it was incorporated, with Franklin for president. Similar  organizations soon rose in several northern States, numbering among  their members many of the most eminent men in the land. The British  Abolition Society, formed in 1787, and the labors of Wilberforce,  Clarkson, and Zachary Macaulay against the slave trade in the West  Indies, had influence here, as had still more the French Assembly's bold  proclamation of the Rights of Man.    The Ordinance of 1787 for the Northwest Territory marked a most decisive  point in the history of slavery. By its decree, in Jefferson's language,  there was never to be either slavery or involuntary servitude in the  said territory otherwise than in punishment for crimes. It is to the  everlasting honor of the southern members then in the Continental  Congress that they all voted for this inhibition. Virginia, whose assent  as a State was necessary to its validity, she having at this time rights  over much of the domain in question, also concurred. Whatever the  strictly legal weight of this prohibition over the immense Louisiana  purchase, it certainly aided much in confirming freedom as the  presupposition and maxim of our law over all our national territory.    Vermont had never recognized slavery save to prohibit it in its first  constitution. In New Hampshire it existed but nominally. The  Massachusetts constitution of 1780 virtually ended it in that State.  Gradual abolition statutes passed in Pennsylvania in 1780, in Rhode  Island and Connecticut in 1784. The constitution made it possible to  forbid the importation of slaves in 1808. A national law to that effect  was passed in 1807, making the trade illegal and affixing to it heavy  penalties. The American Colonization Society was formed in 1816 for the  purpose of negro deportation. It did little of this, but rendered some  service toward carrying out the act against slave importation. A new law  in 1820, which made this traffic piracy, punishable with death, was  partly due to its influence. Also many, like Birney, Gerrit Smith and  the Tappans, who began as colonizationists, subsequently became  abolitionists.    Notwithstanding all these influences slavery increased in strength every  year. South Carolina and Georgia were finding it exceedingly profitable  for cotton and rice culture, and the income from slave traffic into the  vast opening lands of Tennessee and Kentucky constituted an irresistible  temptation. In spite of the law of 1807 and of the indescribable horrors  of the business, even the foreign slave trade went on. The institution  found many defenders in the Federal Convention of 1787, and in the first  and subsequent Congresses. The pleas began to be raised, so current  later, that the negro was an inferior being, slavery God's ordinance, a  blessing to slaves and masters alike, and emancipation a folly. Now  began also that policy of bravado by which, for sixty years, the friends  of slavery bullied their opponents into shameful inaction upon that  accursed thing politically as well as morally, which was so nearly to  cost the nation its life. Thus stood matters when the Missouri  Compromise was mooted in the national Legislature.    We hardly need say that this strife ended in a compromise. Missouri was  created a slave State, balanced by Maine as a free State, but at the  same time slavery was to be excluded forever from all the remainder of  the Louisiana purchase north of 36 degrees  30 minutes, the southern  line of Virginia and Kentucky as well as of Missouri itself. The land  between Missouri and Louisiana had been in 1819 erected into the  \"Territory of Arkansaw.\"    In the memorable discussion over this issue, involving the country as  well as Congress, two sorts of argumentation were heard in favor of the  suit of Missouri. The genuine pro-slavery men urged the sacredness of  property as such, and the special sacredness of property-right in slaves  as tacitly guaranteed by the Constitution. They also made much of the  third article of the Louisiana purchase treaty. This read as follows:  \"The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the  Union of the United States and admitted as soon as possible, according  to the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all  the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States;  and in the meantime they shall be maintained and protected in the free  enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion which they  profess.\"    There were with these, men who acted from mere policy, thinking it best  to admit the slave State because of the difficulty and also the danger  to the Union of suppressing slavery there. They appealed as well to the  sacred compromises in the Constitution, meaning the permission at first  to import slaves, the three-fifths rule for slave representation in  Congress, and the fugitive slave clause. They spoke much of the  necessity of preserving the balance of power within the Union, and of  Congress's inaction as to slavery in the Louisiana purchase hitherto,  and also in Florida. These arguments won many professed foes of slavery,  as Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and Quincy Adams. In all Congress Clay was  the most earnest pleader for the compromise.    To all these arguments the unbending friends of free soil replied that  property right was subordinate to the national good, and that Congress  had full power over territorial institutions and should never have  permitted slavery to curse the domain in question. If it had committed  error in the past, that could not excuse continuance in error. The terms  of the Louisiana purchase, it was further urged, could not, even if they  had been meant to do so, which was not true, detract from this sovereign  power. It was pointed out that in every case in which a State had been  admitted thus far, Congress had prescribed conditions. It was boldly  said, still further, that if slavery threatened disunion unless allowed  its way, it ought all the more to be denied its way.    The chief strength of slavery in this crisis lay in the distressing  practical difficulty, if the prayer of Missouri were refused, of dealing  with slaves and slave proprietorship there, and of quieting a numerous  and spirited population bent upon statehood and slavery together. The  more decided foes of slavery did not sufficiently consider these  complications. Nor did they duly reflect upon the sweeping triumph which  freedom had withal secured in the pledge that the vast bulk of the  Louisiana purchase should be forever free. The pledge was indeed broken  in 1854, but not until such a sense of its sacredness had been impressed  upon the country that the breach availed slavery nothing.        CHAPTER IV.    THE GREAT NULLIFICATION    [1816-1828]    The tariff rates of 1816 on cottons and woollens were to be twenty-five  per cent. for three years, after that twenty. Instead of this the cotton  tariff was in 1824 replaced at twenty-five per cent., the same as that  upon woollens costing thirty-three and a third cents or less per square  yard; woollens over this price bearing thirty per cent. Wool, which by  the tariff of 1816 was free,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#5)"],[1," escape observation. By way of a nest they build  a rough-and-ready cup-shaped structure in a low bush or on the ground;  but, as Hume remarked, \"the bird, as a rule, conceals the nest so  well that, though a loose, and for the size of the architect, a large  structure, it is difficult to find, even when one closely examines  the bush in which it is.\"    Three other species of laughing-thrush must be numbered among common  birds of the Himalayas, although they, like the heroine of _A Bad  Girl's Diary_, are often heard and not seen. The white-throated  laughing-thrush (_Garrulax albigularis_) is a handsome bird larger  than a myna. Its general colour is rich olive brown. It has a black  eyebrow and shows a fine expanse of white shirt front. It goes about  in large flocks and continually utters a cry, loud and plaintive and  not in the least like laughter.    The remaining laughing-thrushes are known as the rufous-chinned  (_Ianthocincla rufigularis_) and the red-headed (_Trochalopterum  erythrocephalum_). The former may be distinguished from the  white-throated species by the fact that the lower part only of its  throat is white, the chin being red. The red-headed laughing-thrush  has no white at all in the under parts. The next member of the family  of the Crateropodidae that demands our attention is the rusty-cheeked  scimitar-babbler (_Pomatorhinus erythrogenys_).    Scimitar-babblers are so called because of the long, slender,  compressed beak, which is curved downwards like that of a sunbird.    Several species of scimitar-babbler occur in the Himalayas. The above  mentioned is the most abundant in the Western Himalayas. This species  is known as the _Banbakra_ at Mussoorie. Its bill is 1-1/2 inch long.  The upper plumage is olive brown. The forehead, cheeks, sides of the  neck, and thighs are chestnut-red, as is a patch under the tail. The  chin and throat and the median portion of the breast and abdomen are  white with faint grey stripes. Scimitar-babblers have habits similar  to those of laughing-thrushes. They go about in pairs, seeking for  insects among fallen leaves. The call is a loud whistle.    Very different in habits and appearance from any of the babblers  mentioned above is the famous Himalayan whistling-thrush  (_Myiophoneous temmincki_). To see this bird it is necessary to repair  to some mountain stream. It is always in evidence in the neighbourhood  of the dhobi's ghat at Naini Tal, and is particularly abundant on  the banks of the Kosi river round about Khairna. At first sight the  Himalayan whistling-thrush looks very like a cock blackbird. His  yellow bill adds to the similitude. It is only when he is seen with  the sun shining upon him that the cobalt blue patches in his plumage  are noticed. His habit is to perch on the boulders which are washed  by the foaming waters of a mountain torrent. On these he finds plenty  of insects and snails, which constitute the chief items on his menu.  He pursues the elusive insect in much the same way as a wagtail does,  calling his wings to his assistance when chasing a particularly nimble  creature. He has the habit of frequently expanding his tail. This  species utters a loud and pleasant call, also a shrill cry like that  of the spotted forktail. All torrent-haunting birds are in the habit  of uttering such a note; indeed it is no easy task to distinguish  between the alarm notes of the various species that frequent mountain  streams.    Of very different habits is the black-headed sibia (_Lioptila  capistrata_). This species is strictly arboreal. As mentioned  previously, it is often found in company with flocks of tits and other  gregarious birds. It feeds on insects, which it picks off the leaves  of trees. Its usual call is a harsh twitter. It is a reddish brown  bird, rather larger than a bulbul, with a black-crested head. There  is a white bar on the wing.    The Indian white-eye (_Zosterops palbebrosa_) is not at all like any  of the babblers hitherto described. In size, appearance, and habits,  it approximates closely to the tits, with which it often consorts.  Indeed, Jerdon calls the bird the white-eyed tit. It occurs in all  well-wooded parts of the country, both in the plains and the hills.  No bird is easier to identify. The upper parts are greenish yellow,  and the lower bright yellow, while round the eye runs a broad  conspicuous ring of white feathers, whence the popular names of the  species, white-eye and spectacle-bird. Except at the breeding season,  it goes about in flocks of considerable size. Each individual utters  unceasingly a low, plaintive, sonorous, cheeping note. As was stated  above, all arboreal gregarious birds have this habit. It is by means  of this call note that they keep each other apprised of their  whereabouts. But for such a signal it would scarcely be possible for  the flock to hold together. At the breeding season the cock white-eye  acquires an unusually sweet song. The nest is an exquisite little  cup, which hangs, like a hammock, suspended from a slender forked  branch. Two pretty pale blue eggs are laid.    A very diminutive member of the babbler clan is the fire-cap  (_Cephalopyrus flammiceps_). The upper parts of its plumage are olive  green; the lower portions are golden yellow. In the cock the chin  is suffused with red. The cock wears a further ornament in the shape  of a cap of flaming red, which renders his identification easy.    Until recently all ornithologists agreed that the curious  starling-like bird known as the spotted-wing (_Psaroglossa  spiloptera_) was a kind of aberrant starling, but systematists have  lately relegated it to the Crateropodidae. At Mussoorie the natives  call it the _Puli_. Its upper parts are dark grey spotted with black.  The wings are glossy greenish black with white spots. The lower parts  are reddish. A flock of half-a-dozen or more birds having a  starling-like appearance, which twitter like stares and keep to the  topmost branches of trees, may be set down safely as spotted-wings.    We now come to the last of the Crateropodidae--the bulbuls. These  birds are so different from most of their brethren that they are held  to constitute a sub-family. I presume that every reader is familiar  with the common bulbul of the plains. To every one who is not, my  advice is that he should go into the verandah in the spring and look  among the leaves of the croton plants. The chances are in favour of  this search leading to the discovery of a neat cup-shaped nest owned  by a pair of handsome crested birds, which wear a bright crimson patch  under the tail, and give forth at frequent intervals tinkling notes  that are blithe and gay.    Both the species of bulbul common in the plains ascend the lower ranges  of the Himalayas. These are the Bengal red-vented bulbul (_Molpastes  bengalensis_) and the Bengal red-whiskered bulbul (_Otocompsa  emeria_).    The addition of the adjective \"Bengal\" is important, for every  province of India has its own special species of bulbul.    The Molpastes bulbul is a bird about half as big again as the sparrow,  but with a longer tail. The black head is marked by a short crest.  The cheeks are brown. There is a conspicuous crimson patch under the  tail. The remainder of the plumage is brown, but each feather on the  body is margined with creamy white, so that the bird is marked by  a pattern that is, as \"Eha\" pointed out, not unlike the scales on  a fish. Both ends of the tail feathers are creamy white.    Otocompsa is a far more showy bird. The crest is long and pointed  and curves forward a little over the bill. There is the usual crimson  patch under the tail and another on each cheek. The rest of the cheek  is white, as is the lower plumage. A black necklace, interrupted in  front, marks the junction of the throat and the breast. Neither of  these bulbuls ascends the hills very high, but I have seen the former  at the Brewery below Naini Tal.    The common bulbul of the Himalayas is the white-cheeked species  (_Molpastes leucogenys_). This bird, which is very common at Almora,  has the habits of its brethren in the plains. Its crest is pointed  and its cheeks are white like those of an Otocompsa bulbul. But it  has rather a weedy appearance and lacks the red feathers on the sides  of the head. The patch of feathers under the tail is bright  sulphur-yellow instead of crimson.    The only other species of bulbul commonly seen in the hills is a very  different bird. It is known as the black bulbul (_Hypsipetes  psaroides_).    The bulbuls that we have been considering are inoffensive little birds  which lead quiet and respectable lives. Not so the black bulbuls.  These are aggressive, disreputable-looking creatures which go about  in disorderly, rowdy gangs.    The song of most bulbuls is a medley of pleasant tinkling notes; the  cries of the black bulbuls are harsh and unlovely.    Black bulbuls look black only when seen from a distance. When closely  inspected their plumage is seen to be dark grey. The bill and legs  are red. The crest, I regret to say, usually looks the worse for wear.  Black bulbuls seem never to descend to the ground. They keep almost  exclusively to tops of lofty trees. They are very partial to the nectar  enclosed within the calyces of rhododendron flowers. A party of half  a dozen untidy black birds, with moderately long tails, which keep  to the tops of trees and make much noise, may with certainty be set  down as black bulbuls.    These curious birds form the subject of a separate essay.      THE SITTIDAE OR NUTHATCH FAMILY    The Sittidae are a well-defined family of little birds. When not  occupied with domestic cares, they congregate in small flocks that  run up and down the trunks and branches of trees in search of insects.  The nuthatch most commonly seen in the hills is the white-tailed  species (_Sitta himalayensis_). The general hue of this bird is slaty  blue. The forehead and a broad line running"]]]
