ACID, lemon: a good substitute for this expensive article, suitable for  soups, fish sauces, and many other purposes, may be made of a dram of  lump sugar pounded, and six drops of lemon essence, to three ounces of  crystal vinegar. The flavour of the lemon may also be communicated to  the vinegar, by an infusion of lemon peel.      ACIDS, to remove stains caused by acids. See STAINS.      ACCIDENTS BY FIRE. Much mischief frequently arises from the want of a  little presence of mind on such occasions, when it is well known that a  small quantity of water speedily and properly applied, would obviate  great danger. The moment an alarm of fire is given in a house, some  blankets should be wetted in a tub of water, and spread on the floor of  the room where the fire is, and the flames beaten out with a wet  blanket. Two or three pails of water thus applied, will be more  effectual than a larger quantity poured on in the usual way, and at a  later period. If a chimney be on fire, the readiest way is to cover the  whole front of the fire-place with a wet blanket, or thrust it into the  throat of the chimney, or make a complete inclosure with the  chimney-board. By whatever means the current of air can be stopped  below, the burning soot will be put out as rapidly as a candle is by an  extinguisher, and upon the same principle. A quantity of salt thrown  into water will increase its power in quenching the flames, and muddy  water is better for this purpose than clear water. Children, and  especially females, should be informed, that as flame tends upward, it  is extremely improper for them to stand upright, in case their clothes  take fire; and as the accident generally begins with the lower part of  the dress, the flames meeting additional fuel as they rise, become more  fatal, and the upper part of the body necessarily sustains the greatest  injury. If there be no assistance at hand in a case of this kind, the  sufferer should instantly throw herself down, and roll or lie upon her  clothes. A carpet, hearth rug, or green baize table cloth, quickly  wrapped round the head and body, will be an effectual preservative; but  where these are not at hand, the other method may easily be adopted. The  most obvious means of preventing the female dress from catching fire, is  that of wire fenders of sufficient height to hinder the coals and sparks  from flying into the room; and nurseries in particular should never be  without them. Destructive fires often happen from the thoughtlessness of  persons leaving a poker in the grate, which afterward falls out and  rolls on the floor or carpet. This evil may in a great measure be  prevented by having a small cross of iron welded on the poker,  immediately above the square part, about an inch and a half each way.  Then if the poker slip out of the fire, it will probably catch at the  edge of the fender; or if not, it cannot endanger the floor, as the hot  end of the poker will be kept from it by resting on the cross. In cases  of extreme danger, where the fire is raging in the lower part of the  house, a Fire Escape is of great importance. But where this article is  too expensive, or happens not to be provided, a strong rope should be  fastened to something in an upper apartment, having knots or resting  places for the hands and feet, that in case of alarm it may be thrown  out of the window; or if children and infirm persons were secured by a  noose at the end of it, they might be lowered down in safety. No family  occupying lofty houses in confined situations ought to be without some  contrivance of this sort, and which may be provided at a very trifling  expense. Horses are often so intimidated by fire, that they have  perished before they could be removed from the spot; but if a bridle or  a halter be put upon them, they might be led out of the stable as easily  as on common occasions. Or if the harness be thrown over a draught  horse, or the saddle placed on the back of a saddle horse, the same  object may be accomplished.      ADULTERATIONS in baker's bread may be detected, by mixing it with lemon  juice or strong vinegar: if the bread contains chalk, whiting, or any  other alkali, it will immediately produce a fermentation. If ashes,  alum, bones, or jalap be suspected, slice the crumb of a loaf very thin,  set it over the fire with water, and let it boil gently a long time.  Take it off, pour the water into a vessel, and let it stand till nearly  cold; then pour it gently out, and in the sediment will be seen the  ingredients which have been mixed. The alum will be dissolved in the  water, and may be extracted from it. If jalap has been used, it will  form a thick film on the top, and the heavy ingredients will sink to the  bottom. See BEER, FLOUR, SPIRITS, WINE.      AGUE. Persons afflicted with the ague ought in the first instance to  take an emetic, and a little opening medicine. During the shaking fits,  drink plenty of warm gruel, and afterwards take some powder of bark  steeped in red wine. Or mix thirty grains of snake root, forty of  wormwood, and half an ounce of jesuit's bark powdered, in half a pint of  port wine: put the whole into a bottle, and shake it well together. Take  one fourth part first in the morning, and another at bed time, when the  fit is over, and let the dose be often repeated, to prevent a return of  the complaint. If this should not succeed, mix a quarter of an ounce  each of finely powdered Peruvian bark, grains of paradise, and long  pepper, in a quarter of a pound of treacle. Take a third part of it as  soon as the cold fit begins, and wash it down with a glass of brandy. As  the cold fit goes off, and the fever approaches, take a second third  part, with the like quantity of brandy; and on the following morning  fasting, swallow the remainder, with the same quantity of brandy as  before. Three doses of this excellent electuary have cured hundreds of  persons, and seldom been known to fail. To children under nine years of  age, only half the above quantity must be given. Try also the following  experiment. When the cold fit is on, take an egg beaten up in a glass of  brandy, and go to bed directly. This very simple recipe has proved  successful in a number of instances, where more celebrated preparations  have failed.      AIR. Few persons are sufficiently aware, that an unwholesome air is the  common cause of disease. They generally pay some attention to what they  eat and drink, but seldom regard what goes into the lungs, though the  latter often proves more fatal than the former. Air vitiated by the  different processes of respiration, combustion, and putrefaction, or  which is suffered to stagnate, is highly injurious to health, and  productive of contagious disorders. Whatever greatly alters its degree  of heat or cold, also renders it unwholesome. If too hot, it produces  bilious and inflammatory affections: if too cold, it obstructs  perspiration, and occasions rheumatism, coughs, and colds, and other  diseases of the throat and breast. A damp air disposes the body to  agues, intermitting fevers, and dropsies, and should be studiously  avoided. Some careful housewives, for the sake of bright and polished  stoves, frequently expose the health of the family in an improper  manner; but fires should always be made, if in the height of summer,  when the weather is wet or cold, to render the air wholesome; and let  the fire-irons take care of themselves. No house can be wholesome,  unless the air has a free passage through it: dwellings ought therefore  to be daily ventilated, by opening the windows and admitting a current  of fresh air into every room. Instead of making up beds as soon as  people rise out of them, a practice much too common, they ought to be  turned down, and exposed to dry fresh air from the open windows. This  would expel any noxious vapours, and promote the health of the family.  Houses surrounded with high walls, trees, or plantations, are rendered  unwholesome. Wood, not only obstructs the free current of air, but sends  forth exhalations, which render it damp and unhealthy. Houses situated  on low ground, or near lakes and ponds of stagnant water, are the same:  the air is charged with putrid exhalations, which produce the most  malignant effects. Persons obliged to occupy such situations should  live well, and pay the strictest regard to cleanliness. The effluvia  arising from church-yards and other burying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#5)"],[1,"  characteristics of the fungi. They may differ from the fungi in their  vegetative functions, yet they have so many things in common that I am  inclined to place them under this group.    Many, such as the yeast fungus, the various fermentative fungi, and the  Bacteria concerned in the process of decomposition, are indeed very  useful. The enrichment and preparation of soils for the uses of higher  plants, effected by Bacteria, are very important services.    Parasites derive their nourishment from living plants and animals. They  are so constituted that when their nourishing threads come within range  of the living plant they answer a certain impulse by sending out special  threads, enveloping the host and absorbing nutrition. Saprophitic plants  do not experience this reaction from the living plants. They are  compelled to get their nourishment from decaying products of plants or  animals, consequently they live in rich ground or leaf mold, on decayed  wood, or on dung. Parasites are usually small, being limited by their  host. Saprophytes are not thus limited for food supply and it is  possible to build up large plants such as the common mushroom group,  puff-balls, etc.    The spores are the seeds or reproductive bodies of the mushroom. They  are very fine, and invisible to the naked eye except when collected  together in great masses. Underneath mushrooms, frequently, the grass or  wood will be white or plainly discolored from the spores. The hymenium  is the surface or part of the plant which bears the spores. The  hymenophore is the part which supports the hymenium.    In the common mushroom, and in fact many others, the spores develop on a  certain club-like cell, called basidium (plural, basidia), on each of  which four spores usually develop. In morels these cells are elongated  into cylindrical membranous sacs called asci, in each of which eight  spores are usually developed. The spores will be found of various  colors, shapes, and sizes, a fact which will be of great assistance to  the student in locating strange species and genera. In germination the  spores send out slender threads which Botanists call mycelium, but which  common readers know as spawn.    The method and place of spore development furnish a basis for the  classification of fungi. The best way to acquire a thorough knowledge of  both our edible and poisonous mushrooms is to study them in the light of  the primary characters employed in their classification and their  natural relation to each other.    There is a wide difference of opinion as to the classification of  mushrooms. Perhaps the most simple and satisfactory is that of Underwood  and Cook. They arrange them under six groups:      1. Basidiomycetes--those in which the spores or reproductive bodies          are naked or external as shown in illustration 2 on page 15.      2. Ascomycetes--those in which the spores are inclosed in sacs or          asci. These sacs are very clearly represented in illustration          Figure 4 on page 18. This will include the Morels, Pezizae,          Pyrenomycetes, Tuberaceae, Sphairiacei, etc.      3. Physcomycetes--including the Mucorini, Saprolegniaceae, and          Peronosporeae. Potato rot and downy mildew on grape vines belong          to this family.      4. Myxomycetes--Slime moulds.      5. Saccharomycetes--Yeast fungi.      6. Schizomycetes--are minute, unicellular Protophytes which reproduce          mainly by transverse fission.      CLASS, FUNGI--SUB-CLASS, BASIDIOMYCETES.    This class will include all gill-bearing fungi, Polyporus, Boletus,  Hydnum, etc.    Fungi of this class are divided into four natural groups:      1. Hymenomycetes.    2. Gasteromycetes.    3. Uredinae.    4. Ustilagineae.      GROUP 1--HYMENOMYCETES.    Under this group will be placed all fungi composed of membranes, fleshy,  woody, or gelatinous, whether growing on the ground or on wood. The  hymenium, or spore-bearing surface, is external at an early stage in the  life of the plant. The spores are borne on basidia as explained in  Figure 2, page 6. When the spores ripen they fall to the ground or are  carried by the wind to a host that presents all the conditions necessary  for germination; there they produce the mycelia or white thread-like  vines that one may have noticed in plowing sod, in old chip piles, or  decayed wood. If one will examine these threads there will be found  small knots which will in time develop into the full grown mushroom.  Hymenomycetes are divided into six families:      1. Agaricaceae. Hymenium with gills.    2. Polyporaceae. Hymenium with pores.    3. Hydnaceae. Hymenium with spines.    4. Thelephoraceae. Hymenium horizontal and mostly on the under surface.    5. Clavariaceae. Hymenium on a smooth club-shaped surface.    6. Tremellaceae. Hymenium even and superior. Gelatinous fungi.      FAMILY 1--AGARICACEAE.    [Illustration: Figure 7.--Spore-print of Agaricus arvensis.]    In the Agaricaceae or common mushrooms, and in all other of similar  structure, the spore-producing membranes are found on the under surface  of the cap. They consist of thin lamellae, or gills, attached by the  upper edge to the cap and extending from the stem to the margin of the  cap. Very frequently that space may be entirely utilized by shorter  lamellae, or gills, intervening between the longer, especially toward the  margin of the cap. In a few species where the stem seems to be wanting,  or where it is attached to the side of the cap, the lamellae, or gills,  radiate from the point of attachment or from the lateral stem to other  parts of the circumference of the cap. Berkeley gives the following  characteristics: Hymenium, inferior, spread over easily divisible gills  or plates, radiating from a center or stem, which may be either simple  or branched.    This family includes the following genera:      1. Agaricus--Gills, not melting, edge acute; including all the          sub-genera which have been elevated to the rank of genera.      2. Coprinus--Gills deliquescent, spores black.      3. Cortinarius--Gills persistent, veil spider-web-like, terrestrial.      4. Paxillus--Gills separating from the hymenophorum and decurrent.      5. Gomphidius--Gills branched and decurrent, pileus top-shaped.      6. Bolbitius--Gills becoming moist, spores colored.      7. Lactarius--Gills milky, terrestrial.      8. Russula--Gills equal, rigid, and brittle, terrestrial.      9. Marasmius--Gills thick, tough, hymenium dry.      10. Hygrophorus--Stem confluent with the hymenophorum; gills sharp          edged.      11. Cantharellus--Gills thick, branched, rounded edge.      12. Lentinus--Pileus hairy, hard, tough; gills, tough, unequal,          toothed; on logs and stumps.      13. Lenzites--Whole plant corky; gills simple or branched.      14. Trogia--Gills venose, fold-like, channelled.      15. Panus--Gills corky, with acute edge.      16. Nyctalis--Veil universal; gills broad, often parasitic.      17. Schizophyllum--Gills corky, split longitudinally.      18. Xerotus--Gills tough, fold-like.    Therefore the gill-bearing fungi are known under the family name,  Agaricaceae, or more generally known as Agarics.    [Illustration: Figure 8.--Spore-print of Hypholoma sublatertium.]    This family is divided into five series, according to the color of their  spores. The spores when seen in masses possess certain colors, white,  rosy, rusty, purple-brown and black. Therefore the first and most  important part to be determined in locating a mushroom is to ascertain  the color of the spores. To do this, take a fresh, perfect, and fully  developed specimen, remove the stem from the cap. Place the cap with the  gills downward on the surface of dark velvety paper, if you suspect the  spores to be white. Invert a finger bowl or a bell glass over the cap to  keep the air from blowing the spores away. If the spores should be  colored, white paper should be used. If the specimen is left too long  the spore deposit will continue upward between the gills and it may  reach an eighth of an inch in height, in which case if great care is  taken in removing the cap there will be a perfect likeness of the gills  and also the color of the spores.    [Illustration: Figure 9.--Spore-print of a Flammula.]    There are two ways of making these spore prints quite permanent. First  take a piece of thin rice paper, muscilage it and allow it to dry, then  proceed as above. In this way the print will stand handling quite a  little. Another way, and that used to prepare the spore-prints in these  photographs, is to obtain the spore-print upon Japanese paper as in the  preceding method, then by an atomizer spray the print gently and  carefully with a fixative such as is used in fixing charcoal drawings.  Success in making spore-prints requires both time and care, but the  satisfaction they give is ample recompense for the trouble. It is more  difficult to obtain good prints from the white-spored mushrooms than  from those bearing colored spores, because it is hard to obtain a black  paper having a dull velvety surface, and the spores will not adhere well  to a smooth-finished, glossy paper. For the prints illustrated I am  indebted to Mrs. Blackford.    [Illustration: Figure 10.--Spore-print of a Boletus.]    If the plant is dry it is well to moisten the fingerbowl or bell-glass  on the inside before placing it over the mushroom. The spores of Boleti,  and, indeed, all fungi can be caught and fixed in the same way.    From the study of these spore-prints we shall find five different colors  of spores. This family is, therefore, divided into five series,  determined by the color of the spores, which are always constant in  color, size and shape.    The five series will be treated in the following order:      1. The white-spored Agarics.    2. The rosy-spored Agarics.    3. The rusty-spored Agarics.    4. The purple-brown-spored Agarics.    5. The black-spored Agarics.      =ANALYTICAL KEY.= "]]]
