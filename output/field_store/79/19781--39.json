A Minister vigorously protested against this superstition,  pointing out that the proper way to meet a drought would be to reduce  the quantity of food consumed, and to practise rigid economy in all  things. \"What have these creatures to do with the matter?\" he asked. \"If  God had wished to put them to death, He had better not have given  them life. If they can really produce drought, to burn them will only  increase the calamity.\" The Duke accordingly desisted; and although  there was a famine, it is said to have been less severe than usual.    In B.C. 523 there was a comet. A Minister said, \"This broom-star sweeps  away the old, and brings in the new. The doings of God are constantly  attended by such appearances.\"    Under B.C. 532 we have the record of a stone speaking. The Marquis of  Lu enquired of his chief musician if this was a fact, and received the  following answer: \"Stones cannot speak. Perhaps this one was possessed  by a spirit. If not, the people must have heard wrong. And yet it  is said that when things are done out of season, and discontents and  complaints are stirring among the people, then speechless things do  speak.\"    Human Sacrifices.--Human sacrifices appear to have been not altogether  unknown. The _Commentary_ tells us that in B.C. 637, in consequence of  a failure to appear and enter into a covenant, the Viscount of Tseng was  immolated by the people of the Chu State, to appease the wild tribes  of the east. The Minister of War protested: \"In ancient times the six  domestic animals were not offered promiscuously in sacrifice; and for  small matters, the regular sacrificial animals were not used. How then  should we dare to offer up a man? Sacrifices are performed for the  benefit of men, who thus as it were entertain the spirits. But if men  sacrifice men, who will enjoy the offering?\"    Again, in B.C. 529, the ruler of the Ch'u State destroyed the Ts'ai  State, and offered up the heir apparent as a victim. An officer said,  \"This is inauspicious. If the five sacrificial animals may not be used  promiscuously, how much less can a feudal prince be offered up?\"    The custom of burying live persons with the dead was first practised in  China in B.C. 580. It is said to have been suggested by an earlier  and more harmless custom of placing straw and wooden effigies in the  mausolea of the great. When the \"First Emperor\" died in B.C. 210, all  those among his wives who had borne no children were buried alive with  him.    Praying for Rain.--From another Commentary on the _Spring and Autumn_,  by Ku-liang Shu, fourth century B.C., we have the following note on  Prayers for Rain, which are still offered up on occasions of drought,  but now generally through the medium of Taoist and Buddhist priests:--    \"Prayers for rain should be offered up in spring and summer only; not in  autumn and winter. Why not in autumn and winter? Perhaps the moisture of  growing things is not then exhausted; neither has man reached the limit  of his skill. Why in spring and summer? Because time is pressing and  man's skill is of no further avail. How so? Because without rain just  then nothing could be made to grow; the crops would fail, and famine  ensue. But why wait until time is pressing, and man's skill of no  further avail? Because to pray for rain is the same thing as asking a  favour, and the ancients did not lightly ask favours. Why so? Because  they held it more blessed to give than to receive; and as the latter  excludes the former, the main object of man's life is taken away. How  is praying for rain asking a favour? It is a request that God will do  something for us. The divine men of old who had any request to make to  God were careful to prefer it in due season. At the head of all his high  officers of State, the prince would proceed in person to offer up his  prayer. He could not ask any one else to go as his proxy.\"    Posthumous Honours for Confucius.--Before leaving Confucius, it is  necessary to add that now for many centuries he has been the central  figure and object of a cult as sincere as ever offered by man to any  being, human or divine. The ruler of Confucius' native State of Lu was  profoundly distressed by the Sage's death, and is said to have built a  shrine to commemorate his great worth, at which sacrifices were offered  at the four seasons. By the time however that the Chou dynasty was  drawing to its close (third century B.C.), it would be safe to say  that, owing to civil war and the great political upheaval generally, the  worship of Confucius was altogether discontinued. It certainly did not  flourish under the \"First Emperor\" (see _post_), and was only revived in  B.C. 195 by the first Emperor of the Han dynasty, who visited the grave  of Confucius in Shantung and sacrificed to his spirit a pig, a sheep,  and an ox. Fifty years later a temple was built to Confucius at his  native place; and in A.D. 72 his seventy-two disciples were admitted  to share in the worship, music being shortly afterwards added to the  ceremonial. Gradually, the people came to look upon Confucius as a  god, and women used to pray to him for children, until the practice was  stopped by Edict in A.D. 472. In 505, which some consider to be the date  of the first genuine Confucian Temple, wooden images of the Sage were  introduced; in 1530 these were abolished, and inscribed tablets of wood,  in use at the present day, were substituted. In 555 temples were placed  in all prefectural cities; and later on, in all the important cities  and towns of the empire. In the second and eighth months of each  year, before dawn, sacrifices to Confucius are still celebrated with  considerable solemnity and pomp, including music and dances by bands of  either thirty-six or sixty-four performers.    Mencius and Confucianism.--Mencius, who lived B.C. 372-289, and devoted  himself to the task of spreading and consolidating the Confucian  teachings, made no attempt to lead back the Chinese people towards their  early beliefs in a personal God and in a spiritual world beyond the ken  of mortals. He observes in a general way that \"those who obey God are  saved, while those who rebel against Him perish,\" but his reference is  to this life, and not to a future one. He also says that those whom God  destines for some great part, He first chastens by suffering and  toil. But perhaps his most original contribution will be found in the  following paragraph:--    \"By exerting his mental powers to the full, man comes to understand his  own nature. When he understands his own nature, he understands God.\"    In all the above instances the term used for God is _T'ien_. Only in one  single passage does Mencius use _Shang Ti_:--\"Though a man be wicked, if  he duly prepares himself by fasting and abstinence and purification by  water, he may sacrifice to God.\"    Ch'u Yuan.--The statesman-poet Ch'u Yuan, B.C. 332-295, who drowned  himself in despair at his country's outlook, and whose body is still  searched for annually at the Dragon-Boat festival, frequently alludes to  a Supreme Being:--         Almighty God, Thou who art impartial,       And dost appoint the virtuous among men as Thy Assistants.    One of his poems is entitled \"God Questions,\" and consists of a number  of questions on various mysteries in the universe. The meaning of the  title would be better expressed by \"Questions put to God,\" but we are  told that such a phrase was impossible on account of the holiness of  God and the irreverence of questioning Him. One question was, \"Who has  handed down to us an account of the beginning of all things, and how  do we know anything about the time when heaven and earth were without  form?\" Another question was, \"As Nu-ch'i had no husband, how could she  bear nine sons?\" The _Commentary_ tells us that Nu-ch'i was a \"divine  maiden,\" but nothing more seems to be known about her.    The following prose passage is taken from Ch'u Yuan's biography:--    \"Man came originally from God, just as the individual comes from his  parents. When his span is at an end, he goes back to that from which  he sprang. Thus it is that in the hour of bitter trial and exhaustion,  there is no man but calls to God, just as in his hours of sickness and  sorrow every one of us will turn to his parents.\"    The great sacrifices to God and to Earth, as performed by the early  rulers of China, had been traditionally associated with Mount T'ai, in  the modern province of Shantung, one of China's five sacred mountains.  Accordingly, in B.C. 219, the self-styled \"First Emperor,\" desirous  of restoring the old custom, which had already fallen into desuetude,  proceeded to the summit of Mount T'ai, where he is said to have carried  out his purpose, though what actually took place was always kept a  profound secret. The literati, however, whom the First Emperor had  persecuted by forbidding any further study of the Confucian Canon, and  burning all the copies he could lay hands on, gave out that he had been  prevented from performing the sacrifices by a violent storm of rain,  alleging as a reason that he was altogether deficient in the virtue  required for such a ceremony.    It may be added that in B.C. 110 the then reigning Emperor proceeded  to the summit of Mount T'ai, and performed the great sacrifice to God,  following this up by sacrificing to Earth on a hill at the foot of  the mountain. At the ceremony he was dressed in yellow robes, and was  accompanied by music. During the night there was light, and a white  cloud hung over the altar. The Emperor himself declared that he saw  a dazzling glory, and heard a voice speaking to him. The truthful  historian--the Herodotus of China--who has left an account of these  proceedings, accompanied the Emperor on this and other occasions; he  was also present at the sacrifices"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23319"],[0,"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught (#5)"],[1,"the lamp-black, which is the coloring matter, forms  with the water a chemical solution rather than a mechanical mixture. In  inferior ink the lamp-black is more or less held in suspension, and by  prolonged exposure to the air will separate, so that on being spread the  solid particles will aggregate by themselves and the water by itself.    This explains why draughtsmen will, after the ink has been exposed to  the air for an hour or two, add a drop of mucilage to it; the mucilage  thickening the solution, adding weight to the water, and deferring the  separation of the lamp-black.    A good India ink is jet black, flows easily, lies close to, does not  stand upon or sink into the paper, and has an even lustre, the latter  being an indication of fineness. The more perfect the incorporation of  the lamp-black with the water the easier the ink will flow, the less  liable it is to clog the instruments, the more even and sharp the edges  of the lines, and the finer the lines that may be drawn.    Usually India ink can only be tested by actual trial; but since it is  desirable to test before purchasing it, it may be mentioned that one  method is to mix a little on the finger nail, and if it has a \"bronzy\"  gloss it is a good indication. It should also spread out and dry without  any tendency to separate.    The best method of testing is to mix a very little, and drop a single  drop in a tumbler of clear water. The best ink will diffuse itself over  the surface, and if the water is disturbed will diffuse itself through  the water, leaving it translucent and black, with a slight tinge of  bronze color. A coarser ink will act in a similar manner, but make the  water somewhat opaque, with a blue-black, or dull, ashy color. A still  coarser ink will, when diffused over the surface of the water, show fine  specks, like black dust, on the surface. This is readily apparent,  showing that the mixture of the ink is not homogeneous.    When it is an object to have the lines of a drawing show as black as  possible, as for drawings that are to be photo-engraved, the ink should  be mixed so thickly as to have a tendency to lift when a body, such as a  lead pencil, is lifted out of it. For Patent Office drawings some will  mix it so thickly that under the above test it appears a little stringy.    The thicker the ink can be used the better, because the tendency of the  carbon to separate is less; and it is for this reason that the test  mentioned with a tumbler of water is so accurate. When ink is to be used  on parchment, or glossy tracing-paper, it will flow perfectly if a few  drops of ox-gall be mixed with it; but on soft paper, or on bristol  board, this will cause the ink to spread.    For purposes of measurement, there are special rules or scales of steel  and of paper manufactured. The steel rules are finely and accurately  divided, and some are of triangular form, so that when laid upon the  paper the lines divided will lie close to the paper, and the light will  fall directly on the ruled surface. Triangular rules or scales are  therefore much superior to flat ones. The object of having a paper rule  or scale is, that the paper will expand and contract under varying  degrees of atmospheric moisture, the same as the drawing paper does.    Figure 16 represents a triangular scale, having upon it six different  divisions of the inch. These are made in different patterns, having  either decimal divisions or the vulgar fractions. Being made of steel,  and nickel-plated, they are proof against the moisture of the fingers,  and are not subject to the variation of the wooden scale.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]          CHAPTER II.    _THE PREPARATION AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS._      The points of drawing instruments require to be very accurately prepared  and shaped, to enable them to make clean, clear lines. The object is to  have the points as sharp as they can be made without cutting the paper,  and the curves as even and regular as possible.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    The lining pen should be formed as in Figure 17, which presents an edge  and a front view of the points. The inside faces should be flat across,  and slightly curved in their lengths, as shown. If this curve is too  great, as shown exaggerated in Figure 18, the body of the ink lies too  near the point and is apt to flow too freely, running over the pen-point  and making a thick, ragged line. On the other hand, if the inside faces,  between which the ink lies, are too parallel and narrow near the points,  the ink dries in the pen, and renders a too frequent cleaning necessary.  Looking at the face of the pen as at A in Figure 17, its point should  have an even curve, as shown, the edge being as sharp as it can be made  without cutting the drawing paper. Upon this quality depends the  fineness and cleanness of the lines it will make. This thin edge should  extend around the curve as far as the dotted line, so that it will be  practicable to slant the pen in either of the directions shown in Figure  19; and it is obvious that its thickness must be equal around the arc,  so that the same thickness of line will be drawn whether the pen be held  vertical or slanted in either direction.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    The outside faces of the pen should be slightly curved, so that when  held vertically, as in Figure 20 (the dotted line representing the  centre of the length of the instrument), and against the square blade S,  the point will meet the paper a short distance from the lower edge of S  as shown. By this means it is not necessary to adjust the square edge  exactly coincident with the line, but a little way from it. This is an  advantage for two reasons: first, the trouble of setting the square-edge  exactly coincident is avoided, and, secondly, the liability of the ink  to adhere to the edge of the square-blade and flow on to the paper and  make a thick, ragged line, is prevented.    The square being set as near to the line as desired, the handle may be  held at such an angle that the pen-point will just meet the line when  sloped either as in Figure 21 or 22. If, however, the slope be too much  in the direction shown in Figure 21, practice is necessary to enable the  drawing of straight lines if they be long ones, because any variation in  the angle of the instrument to the paper obviously vitiates the  straightness of the line. If, on the other hand, the square be too close  to the line, and the pen therefore requires to be sloped as in Figure  22, the ink flowing from the pen-point is apt to adhere to the  square-edge, and the result will be a ragged, thick line, as shown in  Figure 23.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    Each of the legs should be of equal thickness at the pen-point edge, so  that when closed together the point will be in the middle of the edge.  The width and curve of each individual point should be quite equal, and  the easiest method of attaining this end is as follows:    Take a small slip of Arkansas oil-stone, and with the pen-points closed  firmly by the screw trim the pen-edges to the required curve as shown at  A, Figure 17, making the curve as even as possible. Then stone the faces  until this curve is brought up to a sharp edge at the point between the  two pen-legs forming the point.    Next take a piece of 000 French emery paper, lay it upon some flat body  like the blade of a square, and smooth the curve of the edge enough to  take off the fine, sharp edge left by the oil-stone; then apply the  outside flat faces of the pen to the emery paper again, bringing the  pen-edge up sharp.    The emery paper will simply have smoothed and polished the surfaces,  still leaving them too sharp, so sharp as to cut the paper, and to take  off this sharp edge (which must first be done on the inside faces) open  the pen-points as wide as the screw will permit. Then wrap one thickness  of the emery paper upon a thin blade, as upon a drawing-triangle, and  pass the open pen-points over it, and move the instrument endwise,  taking care to keep the inside face level with the surface of the emery  paper, so that the pen-points shall not cut through. Next close the  pen-points with the screw until they nearly, but not quite, touch, and  sweep the edge of the pen-point along the emery paper under a slight  pressure, so moving the handle that at each stroke the whole length  around the curved end of the pen will meet the emery surface. During  this motion the inside faces of the pen-point must be held as nearly  vertical as possible, so as to keep the two halves of the pen-point  equal.    The pen is now ready for use, and will draw a fine and clean line.    It is not usual to employ emery paper for the purpose indicated, but it  will be found very desirable, since it leaves a smoother surface and  edge than the oil-stone alone.    Circle-pens are more difficult to put in order than the straight-line  pen, especially those for drawing the smallest circles, which cannot be  well drawn unless the pen is of the precise right shape and in the best  condition.    A circle-pen is shown in Figure 24, in which A represents the point-leg  and B the pen-leg. The point-leg must be the longest because it requires  to enter the drawing paper before the pen meets the surface. The point  should be sharp and round, for any edges or angles on it will cause it  to widen the hole in the paper when it is rotated. To shape the points  to prevent the enlargement of the centre in the paper is one of the most  important considerations in the use of this instrument, especially when  several circles require to be drawn from the same centre. To accomplish  this end the inside of the point-leg should be, as near as possible,  parallel to the length of the instrument (which is"]]]
