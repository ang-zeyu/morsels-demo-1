In a number of  districts Child Care Committees, sponsored by Senior Inspectors of  Schools, have instituted central case registers. These have been a  great help in ensuring that visiting teachers and public health nurses  do not deal independently with the same child and family.    A residential course at Frederic Wallis House, Lower Hutt, has been  planned for visiting teachers and public health nurses in 1956.    (ii) and (iii) _Additional Visiting Teachers and Type of Officer to  Help in Post-Primary Schools_.--Approval has been given for four  additional visiting teachers--two in Auckland, one in Wellington, and  one in Christchurch. Discussions have been held with representative  post-primary-school principals on the kind of help they need with  problem children. Rather than have visiting teachers specially attached  to the post-primary service, the great majority of principals were  strongly in favour of extending the functions of the Education Boards'  visiting teachers to cover post-primary pupils, so that one individual  could follow the members of a family through their full school career.  Approval has therefore been given for this. As a further assistance to  both primary and post-primary schools, three additional school  psychologists have been appointed.    (iv) _Housing for Teachers._--The Department has been trying to  deal with this problem in two ways:        (_a_) By an extension of existing policy for the erection of      teachers' houses. All Education Boards were consulted as to where      the greatest need for additional houses lay, and, without      exception, they gave highest priority to rural areas and small      towns. The Government is giving consideration to an extension of      policy based on this advice. In 1954, 61 houses were built for      teachers; this year the number is expected to be 84.        (_b_) By the use of the \"pool\" housing scheme administered by      an Inter-departmental Pool Housing Committee. Under this scheme, a      proportion of all new State houses erected is set aside for letting      to State employees and teachers on transfer. The Department of      Education is represented on the Committee that makes the      allocations and represents the needs and interests of the teachers      and the schools. Most of the areas concerned are in housing      settlements.    (v) _Facilities for Recreation._--The use of school grounds and  buildings after school hours is entirely in the hands of boards and  local committees. The Department has no direct authority in the matter,  but does facilitate and encourage such use. Practice varies, but in  many schools very great use is made of school facilities for community  purposes. The work in this respect will be made more effective by the  decision taken at the beginning of 1955 to build halls in all new  post-primary and intermediate schools built to the new designs, to  re-introduce the L2 for L1 subsidy up to L4,000 for halls in primary  schools and to give a pound-for-pound subsidy up to L4,000 on gymnasia  in post-primary schools. Approval has just been given, on an  experimental basis, for a subsidy on a gymnasium and cafeteria in one  intermediate school in Auckland, with the express condition that it be  used \"to provide recreational and cultural facilities for young people  who have left school\".    The Committee recommends these opinions for the consideration of the  Government.      (_f_) Research Into Juvenile Delinquency    The Mazengarb Committee was of opinion that there should be a long-term  study of the problem of delinquency. As a matter of fact the present  Committee heard evidence on this suggestion from several witnesses, and  we were greatly impressed by what we heard. It goes without saying that  if one would seek a remedy for a given problem a thorough diagnosis of  the problem itself is a fundamental prerequisite. First let us find the  facts; let us know what is the nature and extent of the evil; let us  get as much data as to its causes and incidence. With that material in  hand we should be in a better position to search for useful methods of  treatment. This task of fact finding would be a long and arduous one;  it would need to be entrusted to experts of wide knowledge and  experience. A start has already been made by the setting up of the  Inter-Departmental Committee referred to earlier in this report. We  strongly recommend the Government to give very favourable consideration  to this particular proposal, and we hope that ways and means will be  found of giving effect to it. We think that this suggestion is of  fundamental importance in any approach to the problem, and we consider  it should be given consideration by the Government.    _Instruction for Parents_: In the long run the responsibility for  a child's general well-being rests upon the parents. Some can, and do,  take every care to discharge that responsibility. Others either fail or  neglect to do so. In some cases this failure comes from a lack of the  necessary knowledge or from inability to impart it. In one memorandum  addressed to the Committee there appear the following paragraphs:        \"I think it highly probable that much delinquency is due to the      fact that parents simply do not know how to teach their children on      a subject that many parents regard as secret between parents. I      think it highly unlikely that a parent will consult an adviser      (say, a doctor) as to how the child should be trained, and I am not      so sure that a doctor would know what advice to tender even if he      was consulted.        \"Instruction of parents seems to be the job of a specialist. The      doctors have prepared several booklets on sex instruction.        \"I am wondering if good attendance could be secured for a series of      lectures by specialists to parents, either to both sexes or to      mothers alone. A mother would probably be more likely to attend a      meeting as one of an audience rather than to suffer the      embarrassment of a personal consultation with, say, a doctor to      whom she has to admit that she does not know how to discharge her      duty to her children.        \"It is generally agreed that much of the cause of child delinquency      is due to unsatisfactory home influence and parental control and      example, but the fact that many of the offenders come from good      homes and fine parents is strong evidence, I feel, that there is      some important deficiency even in those good homes, and it may well      be that that deficiency lies in the fact that the parents do not      really know how to give their children the knowledge that they      should have in the way they should receive it. I am confident that      we have people who could help in this important work. Perhaps women      lecturers would be best.\"    We are of opinion that the views expressed above do merit very serious  consideration. We realize the tremendous difficulty we face in trying  to reach those who stand most in need of the help that is here referred  to. We recognize, however, that all our children must spend a big  portion of their young lives in our primary and post-primary schools.  It is here that positive and well-planned character training and  instruction in moral values can be undertaken with a certainty that the  instruction and the training will reach those whom we would wish to  help. Do we take full advantage of this opportunity? Do we give enough  attention to those inner disciplines that are so essential if a good  life is to be enjoyed by our young people? We are satisfied that our  teachers as a whole nobly discharge their obligations to our community  in this regard. We think, however, that the matters touched upon in  this paragraph are within the special province of the Department of  Education and its Minister, and it is our recommendation that they  should be referred to that Minister for examination and for such  positive action as he may consider proper and desirable.    We think also that much more could be done in the homes if the ranks of  our visiting teachers, public health nurses, and school psychologists  were strengthened considerably, and we strongly recommend that action  along these lines should be taken by the Departments of Education and  Health.    We are also of opinion that in any effort to reach parents over the  widest possible field a very useful agency lies ready to our hands in  our Parent-Teacher and Home and School Associations, and it is our hope  that this agency might be much more positively used to awaken and  maintain a due sense of parental responsibility and a proper  understanding of the moral and spiritual needs of children.    With such thoughts in mind, we would recommend that the Director of  Education be asked to confer with the appropriate experts to see how  far, and under what conditions, suitable courses of lectures could be  provided for parents and prospective parents.      The Special Legislation of the 1954 Session    Following upon the presentation of the Mazengarb report the Government  immediately took steps to give effect to those recommendations which  called for special legislation. Three Bills were introduced, the first  dealing with \"indecent publications\", the second dealing with child  welfare, and the third with police offences.    In our order of reference we were directed to study these pieces of  legislation and to report as to their efficacy and as to whether there  were any specific amendments that were necessary or desirable.    In the preparation of this part of our report we have had the advice  and much valued assistance of the Department of Justice. We deal here  with the question of \"publications\". Our comments as to the Child  Welfare Act appear elsewhere in this report. No comment is needed  regarding the amendment to the Police Offences Act. First as to  _publications of a more or less objectionable character"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26978"],[0,"Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather: A Reply (#5)"],[1,"n, and printed by Mather, in London, ten years before, in _The  Memorable Providences relating to Witchcraft and Possessions_, a  somewhat different position is assigned to Mather. After saying \"the  Ministers did often visit us,\" he mentions \"Mr. Mather particularly.\"  \"He took much pains in this great service, to pull this child and her  brother and sister, out of the hands of the Devil. Let us now admire and  adore that fountain, the Lord Jesus Christ, from whence those streams  come. The Lord himself will requite his labor of love.\" In 1690, Mather  was willing to have Goodwin place him in the foreground of the picture,  representing him as pulling the children out of the hand of the Devil.  In 1700, it was expedient to withdraw him into the background: and  Goodwin, accordingly, provided the Committee, of which he was a member,  with a Certificate of a somewhat different color and tenor.    The execution of the woman, Glover, on the charge of having bewitched  these Goodwin children, is one of the most atrocious passages of our  history. Hutchinson[1] says she was one of the \"wild Irish,\" and  \"appeared to be disordered in her senses.\" She was a Roman Catholic,  unable to speak the English language, and evidently knew not what to  make of the proceedings against her. In her dying hour, she was  understood by the interpreter to say, that taking away her life would  not have any effect in diminishing the sufferings of the children. The  remark, showing more sense than any of the rest of them had, was made to  bear against the poor old creature, as a diabolical imprecation.    Between the time of her condemnation and that of her execution, Cotton  Mather took the eldest Goodwin child into his family, and kept her there  all winter. He has told the story of her extraordinary doings, in a  style of blind and absurd credulity that cannot be surpassed. \"Ere  long,\" says he, \"I thought it convenient for me to entertain my  congregation with a Sermon on the memorable providence, wherein these  children had been concerned, (afterwards published).\"    In this connection, it may be remarked that had it not been for the  interference of the Ministers, it is quite likely that \"the sad  circumstances from the invisible world,\" in the Goodwin family, would  never have been heard of, beyond the immediate neighbourhood. It is  quite certain that similar \"circumstances,\" in Mr. Parris's family, in  1692, owed their general publicity and their awful consequences, to the  meetings of Ministers called by him. If the girls, in either case, had  been let alone, they would soon have been weary of what one of them  called their \"sport;\" and the whole thing would have been swallowed,  with countless stories of haunted houses and second sight, in deep  oblivion.    In considering Cotton Mather's connection with the case of the Goodwin  children, and that of the accusing girls, at Salem Village, justice to  him requires that the statements, in my book, of the then prevalent  notions, of the power and pending formidableness of the Kingdom of  Darkness, should be borne in mind. It was believed by Divines generally,  and by people at large, that here, in the American wilderness, a mighty  onslaught upon the Christian settlements was soon to be made, by the  Devil and his infernal hosts; and that, on this spot, the final battle  between Satan and the Church, was shortly to come off. This belief had  taken full possession of Mather's mind, and fired his imagination. In  comparison with the approaching contest, all other wars, even that for  the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, paled their light. It was the great  crusade, in which hostile powers, Moslem, Papal, and Pagan, of every  kind, on earth and from Hell, were to go down; and he aspired to be its  St. Bernard. It was because he entertained these ideas, that he was on  the watch to hear, and prompt and glad to meet, the first advances of  the diabolical legions. This explains his eagerness to take hold of  every occurrence that indicated the coming of the Arch Enemy.    And it must further be borne in mind that, up to the time of the case of  the Goodwin children, he had entertained the idea that the Devil was to  be met and subdued by Prayer. That, and that only, was the weapon with  which he girded himself; and with that he hoped and believed to conquer.  For this reason, he did not advise Goodwin to go to the law. For this  reason, he labored in the distressed household in exercises of prayer,  and took the eldest child into his own family, so as to bring the  battery of prayer, with a continuous bombardment, upon the Devil by whom  she was possessed. For this reason, he persisted in praying in the cell  of the old Irish woman, much against her will, for she was a stubborn  Catholic. Of course, he could not pray _with_ her, for he had no doubt  she was a confederate of the Devil; and she had no disposition to join  in prayer with one whom, as a heretic, she regarded in no better light;  but still he would pray, for which he apologized, when referring to the  matter, afterward.    Cotton Mather was always a man of prayer. For this, he deserves to be  honored. Prayer, when offered in the spirit, and in accordance with the  example, of the Saviour--\"not my will but thine be done,\" \"Your Father  knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him--\" is the noblest  exercise and attitude of the soul. It lifts it to the highest level to  which our faculties can rise. It                \"opens heaven; lets down a stream      Of glory on the consecrated hour      Of man, in audience with the Deity.\"    It was the misfortune of Cotton Mather, that an original infirmity of  judgment, which all the influences of his life and peculiarities of his  mental character and habits tended to exaggerate, led him to pervert the  use and operation of prayer, until it became a mere implement, or  device, to compass some personal end; to carry a point in which he was  interested, whether relating to private and domestic affairs, or to  movements in academical, political, or ecclesiastical spheres. While  according to him entire sincerity in his devotional exercises, and, I  trust, truly revering the character and nature of such expressions of  devout sensibility and aspirations to divine communion, it is quite  apparent that they were practiced by him, in modes and to an extent that  cannot be commended, leading to much self-delusion and to extravagances  near akin to distraction of judgment, and a disordered mental and moral  frame. He would abstain from food--on one occasion, it is said, for  three days together--and spend the time, as he expresses it \"in knocking  at the door of heaven.\" Leaving his bed at the dead hours of the night,  and retiring to his study, he would cast himself on the floor, and  \"wrestle with the Lord.\" He kept, usually, one day of each week in such  fasting, sometimes two. In his vigils, very protracted, he would, in  this prostrate position, be bathed in tears. By such exhausting  processes, continued through days and nights, without food or rest, his  nature failed; he grew faint; physical weakness laid him open to  delusions of the imagination; and his nervous system became deranged.  Sometimes, heaven seemed to approach him, and he was hardly able to bear  the ecstasies of divine love; at other times, his soul would be tossed  in the opposite direction: and often, the two states would follow each  other in the same exercise, as described by him in his Diary:[2]--\"Was  ever man more tempted than the miserable Mather? Should I tell in how  many forms the Devil has assaulted me, and with what subtlety and energy  his assaults have been carried on, it would strike my friends with  horror. Sometimes, temptations to vice, to blasphemy, and atheism, and  the abandonment of all religion as a mere delusion, and sometimes to  self-destruction itself. These, even these, do follow thee, O miserable  Mather, with astonishing fury. But I fall down into the dust, on my  study floor, with tears, before the Lord, and then they quickly vanish,  and it is fair weather again. Lord what wilt thou do with me?\"    His prayers and vigils, which often led to such high wrought and intense  experiences, were, not infrequently, brought down to the level of  ordinary sublunary affairs. In his Diary, he says, on one occasion: \"I  set apart the day for fasting with prayer, and the special intention of  the day was to obtain deliverance and protection from my enemies. I  mentioned their names unto the Lord, who has promised to be my shield.\"  The enemies, here referred to, were political opponents--Governor Dudley  and the supporters of his administration.    At another time, he fixed his heart upon some books offered for sale.  Not having the means to procure them in the ordinary way, he resorted to  prayer: \"I could not forbear mentioning my wishes in my prayers, before  the Lord, that, in case it might be of service to his interests, he  would enable me, in his good Providence, to purchase the treasure now  before me. But I left the matter before him, with the profoundest  resignation.\"    The following entry is of a similar character: \"This evening, I met with  an experience, which it may not be unprofitable for me to remember. I  had been, for about a fortnight, vexed with an extraordinary heart-burn;  and none of all the common medicines would remove it, though for the  present some of them would a little relieve it. At last, it grew so much  upon me, that I was ready to faint under it. But, under my fainting  pain, this reflection came into my mind. There was _this_ among the  sufferings and complaints of my Lord Jesus Christ. My heart was like wax  melted in the middle of my bowels. Hereupon, I begged of the Lord, that,  for the sake of the heart-burn undergone by my Saviour, I might be  delivered from the other and lesser heart-burn wherewith I was now  incommoded. Immediately it was darted"]]]
