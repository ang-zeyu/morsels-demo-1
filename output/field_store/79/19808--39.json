It is prettily decorated inside by delicately stained windows, and has a  small but fine organ. It is full of pathetic relics of poor lost  mariners, and when the wind is howling on stormy nights, one can realize  and understand the sentiments which prompted the building of this votive  temple, and the numerous mementoes, literally covering its walls, placed  there by loving hands in remembrance of dear ones lost--wrecked  perchance in sight of home. Yes, the walls are covered with these  tablets and touching mementoes, and with pictures illustrating the many  terrible shipwrecks which have occurred.    Below is a crypt where the last offerings and prayers are made by  sailors departing on a voyage; and, alas! it is filled with the saddest  relics of those who have never returned. Those, however, who reach  their homes in safety, make it a religious duty to offer up their  grateful thanks.    The purposes of this sea-rock church struck me as a fine and beautiful  expression of affection. I fear we lack much of this kind of sentiment  in England--daily blessings are taken too much as a matter of course,  while reverses are loudly mourned over as afflictions.    Whilst lingering in sympathetic thought, I saw an aged, white-haired  woman, who, poor soul! having toiled all the way up these great heights,  was now on her knees in sorrowful prayer. I saw also several younger  women and maidens in deep mourning, some of them sobbing bitterly over  their prayers. Alas! who could rightly enter into the depths of their  individual sorrow?--perchance a tender husband, a loving son, or devoted  sweetheart, lost in the angry waves below!    On descending, my attention was attracted by a sham military attack made  by a regiment or two of French soldiers. It was interesting to see how  they attempted to carry these well-defended, Gibraltar-like heights.    After passing through the public gardens, and crossing the dock basin in  a small ferry-boat, we walked to the church of St. Nazaire, which stands  on high ground almost immediately opposite to Notre Dame de la Garde.    It is a finely restored Byzantine church, a copy on a large scale of  the little mosque-like temple at its side, which latter was once the  Cathedral church of the town. It is built of alternate blocks of black  and white marble, and the interior is something after the style of Notre  Dame at Paris. Fortunately, we caught the workmen just leaving the  building, and so obtained permission to view it.    But the little Moorish temple under its lee, as a sailor would say,  interested me far more than its imposing and grand-looking child  alongside. It has a low dome, square facade with small cupolas, and  circular chancel. We ascended some steps to its low doorway, almost  stooping as we entered. It was dimly lit by a few oil-lamps; its quaint  arched dome, little galleries, altar, crypts, and organ all within the  compact compass of a circle, or rather, as it seemed to me, of a Maltese  cross--tiny aisles forming the sides of the cross, where there were  shrines and tombs, though scarcely distinguishable in the gloom. The  dome and aisles are supported by wonderfully strong Byzantine arches and  arcades. It struck me that the Maltese cross may have been the shape of  the most ancient Christian temples, the more orthodox Latin cross shape  being afterwards developed by the lengthening of the nave. The date of  this unique little church is said to be very ancient, and probably  stands on the site of the temples of Diana.    Perhaps the place was made even more interesting to me, by the fact of  my thoughts being brought back from the dark ages by observing a  christening going on in one of the dimly lighted aisles; after which a  number of little Sunday school children went through an examination of  the catechism.           *       *       *       *       *    In the early part of the evening we sallied forth to visit the Exchange  and Bourse at the end of the principal street near the harbour,  receiving yet another impression as to the commercial greatness of  Marseilles by a careful survey of this building, which is well worthy of  a great city. I can now better understand why these large towns are so  republican, and show so strong a dislike to imperialism. They complain  that while they _make_ the money, the imperialists _squander_ it.    We were much amused to see nearly all the merchants on 'Change, wearing  white neckties and generally black coats--a very respectable and ancient  custom, which has come down from the time when Marseilles was in the  zenith of her prosperity. I believe even now these merchants are called  \"courtiers of merchandize.\"    The main streets and boulevards are very handsome, with elegant  fountains which relieve the somewhat monotonous regularity. Some of the  squares are of immense size. There is a very large lazaretto, which is  said to be one of the best managed in the world. The _cafes_ are like  small palaces, and the shops rival the finest in Paris.    Here, as in most French cities, no expense is spared in making the  streets gay and brilliant at night. In some of them the electric light  is used.    The French people dearly love their _cafes_, spending many of their  evening hours there instead of _chez eux_. I am not quite sure whether  the Frenchman may honestly be termed a domestic animal; I should rather  say he was intensely gregarious. At all events, I do not think he  understands the full value of _home_ as we do.    It was Sunday when we were there, and the town teemed with holiday life.  Up to noon it was comparatively quiet, with some appearance of sabbath  rest, but after that what a change! The whole place was like a great  fair, every one bent on fun and pleasure: hucksters' stalls,  marionettes, bazaars, rifle-galleries, concerts, theatres, and crowded  _cafes_, the latter resounding with the click of dominoes and billiard  balls; the more quiet folk reading their beloved _Figaro_.    We felt this was indeed very different to our English way of enjoying  Sunday. Even our museums, picture galleries, and such-like comparatively  quiet and innocent places of recreative amusement are not yet declared  open. And thankful we should be that on at least one day in the week  there is peace and rest for both man and beast; and that simply in  obedience to a natural and Divine law, made by the great Creator who so  well knew our human wants and requirements. The more one sees of this  sabbath _unrest_ abroad, the more content one feels for the sweet and  peaceful Sunday rest at home. I do not really believe in the happiness,  health, and prosperity of any people who disregard the sabbath as a holy  day, dedicated to God for bodily rest and spiritual refreshment.        \"Then I turned away in sadness, from these gay and thoughtless lays,      Longing for my own dear country, and the voice of prayer and praise.\"                                       CHAPTER III.

The _mistral_ blew us away from Marseilles, which we left on the  afternoon of the 25th by the two o'clock train for Cannes. The route lay  through rocky defiles, with numerous tunnels, for we were cutting  through the promontories on the sea coast, of which we occasionally  caught magnificent glimpses.    Of Toulon, the great naval arsenal of France, we saw but little as we  passed quickly through its suburbs. Here it was that Napoleon, then a  young lieutenant-colonel of artillery, first made his mark in the  capture of the place by storm from the English in 1793. Englishmen,  however, do not forget that it was accomplished only after a long and  stubborn defence of its garrison, consisting of only a tenth of the  storming party.    The little islands off Hyeres look like gems in the clear dark sea. They  were known in ancient times as the Stoechades, signifying \"the  arranged\" islands, a name indicative of their position in a line from  east to west. The town of Hyeres seems tempting enough as a place of  quiet residence, but the air is very unhealthy from the marshes in the  vicinity.    So far our journey has been pretty close to the sea, but now we quitted  the coast for a time, winding through the Montagnes des Maures, with an  endless succession of tunnels, yet still obtaining frequent peeps at the  coast scenery.    At Frejus we were greatly pleased at the beautiful ruins of the ancient  Roman amphitheatre, quite close to the station: the railway being on a  viaduct here enabled us to get a good view, looking downwards. This  amphitheatre, though not nearly so large as the coliseum at Rome, is far  more perfect. This was the port where, in 1799, Napoleon landed on his  return from Egypt; and from whence, fifteen years later, he embarked  when banished to Elba. Frejus was the ancient _Forum Julii_ established  by Augustus Caesar as a naval station.    At Les Arcs we again approached the coast. The country as we drew nearer  Cannes is very interesting and romantic--great rocky glens and chasms,  with here and there glimpses of the beautiful Mediterranean. It was  about here that we first caught sight of the snow-crested Alps, forming  a grand and sublime background to the lovely scenery.    Many of the little towns _en route_ are finely and picturesquely  situated on the hill-side, overlooking great ravines. Their churches  perched on the highest pinnacle, the wonder being how their  congregations get to them! But probably many of them are only convents.    What very different lives people lead on this fair earth!

The shade shown had a mottled glass in which greens predominated. The  sizes and shapes of these pieces of glass would better be determined  after the woodwork is finished.    [Illustration: Electric Shade Complete]    One manner of fastening the chains is clearly shown in the photograph.  Such a combination will call for an extra piece of oak, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by  3-1/4 in. finished stock.    A good finish for this shade is obtained as follows: Put on a coat of  silver gray water stain. When this has dried, sand lightly with No. 00  sandpaper and apply a coat of golden oak oil stain. Allow this to dry  after wiping the surplus off with a cloth. Put on a coat of black paste  filler and allow to harden over night. When dry, sand lightly and put on  a coat of very thin shellac. Sand this lightly when hard and put on a  coat of wax. This is a very dark finish relieved by high lights of  lighter brown and is known as Antwerp oak.          HOW TO BEND WOOD      The process for making bent wood for furniture parts is the same as for  any other kind of bent-wood work. The pieces should be made close to the  size, with only enough material left on them for \"cleaning up\" after the  bending has been done. The pieces used for the bent work should be good,  clean, \"live\" lumber. Lumber dried on the stump will not bend.    A box must be made in which to steam the pieces of wood to be bent. A  design of a steaming box is shown in the illustration. Such a box is  made by nailing four boards together into a square or rectangular form,  the boards having a length sufficient to take in the length of the  furniture parts to be bent. Both ends of the finished box are squared up  and closed with a board cut to the size, using felt or gunny sack in the  joint to make it as tight as possible. These ends can be nailed on, but  it is best to hold them with a bar of metal set against each one.  Nailing the ends a few times would spoil the box for further use in  steaming.    [Illustration: STEAMING BOX]    [Illustration: HOSE ATTACHED TO TEAKETTLE.]    [Illustration: FORM BLOCKS]    A good teakettle will serve the purpose for a steam generator. A hose is  attached to the spout of the teakettle, as shown in the illustration,  and to the steaming box in a like manner. The steaming box should be  provided with a short piece of gas pipe turned into a hole bored into  one of the sides used for the top on which to attach the hose. A small  hole should be bored into one side of one end of the steaming box, and  this end should be arranged a trifle lower than the other end. The hole  will permit the water of condensation to escape. Steam should not escape  from the box when a charge of wood is being softened. Steam which  escapes from the box in the form of vapor has done no work whatever, and  is just so much waste of fuel. In order to give up its heat to the wood,  the steam must condense and come away from the box as water. Therefore,  in steaming a charge of pieces in the box, never crowd the teakettle so  hard that the steam escapes around the heads of the box or through any  other joints. The steam should be supplied to the box just as fast as it  condenses, and no faster. When the pieces are placed in the box they  should be so arranged that the steam can find ready access to all sides  of each piece.    The curve or bend of the piece to be made must be marked out on a wide  board or on the floor. Nail down several blocks of wood or pieces cut  out like brackets on the board or floor against the drawing, as shown in  the illustration. The wood is sprung between these blocks or forms after  it has been softened by steam. When taking the steamed pieces from the  box do not lose any time in securing them to the forms. Do not take out  more than one piece at a time, as it must be bent to the forms  immediately after taking it from the hot steam. The time of the steaming  will vary with the size of the pieces. Small strips may be steamed in 15  or 20 minutes, while large ones may require several hours to become soft  enough to bend. The pieces must be left in the forms until they are  thoroughly dry.          A SMOKING STAND      When making the smoking stand shown in the accompanying photograph, use  quarter-sawed oak, if possible, as this wood is the most suitable for  finishing in the different mission stains. This little piece of  furniture is very attractive, easy to construct, and is an article that  a smoker would appreciate.    If the stock is purchased finished and sandpapered, it will save much of  the hard work. The material needed is as follows:      One piece, 7/8 by 12 in. by 9 ft. long, for the legs.    One piece, 7/8 by 10 in. by 4 ft. long, for the top.    One piece, 7/8 by 8 in. by 1 ft. long, for the shelves.    One piece, 1/2 by 2 in. by 6 ft. long, for the pipe rack.    The legs can be made first. Cut four pieces off the 12-in. board, each  exactly 25 in. long, and lay each one out with a pair of compasses as  shown in the detail drawing at Fig. 1. With a circle or keyhole saw cut  out the piece, then shave out the saw marks and sandpaper smooth.    [Illustration: Smoking Stand Details]    [Illustration: Finished Smoking Stand]    Next take the 8-in. board and make the shelves. Set a bevel protractor  at a 45-deg. angle, lay out the pieces as shown in Fig. 5, and cut them  out with a saw. Eight pieces are cut out as shown in Fig. 4. These  pieces can be cut out of the scraps left from cutting the legs and  shelves. Cut them so that the grain runs the long way. Place two of  these braces on the bench with the beveled ends toward each other, but  with a piece of 7/8-in. stock between them, and the other two beveled  ends resting against a straightedge. Fasten them to the bench with a  couple of nails, leaving the heads sticking up so that you can pull them  later with a claw hammer. Remove the straightedge and slide the piece  that is between the braces along until it projects 4 or 5 in. from the  side formed by the straightedge. Then place two more braces in the  corners formed by this piece, put two 7/8-in. pieces between the two  braces that are fastened, and the two that are loose, so that each brace  will be in its proper place. Fasten the last two the same as the first  pair. Then remove all the pieces from between the braces and place the  tops of the legs in their stead. These should be fastened to the braces  with 1-in. screws of small diameter, put in at an angle. Bore a hole in  straight for about 1/4-in. with a 1/4-in. bit for each screw, and then  run a gimlet at an angle into the leg. After you have the legs fastened  to the first set of braces, measure up from the bench 10 in. and put in  another set, being careful to get them all the same distance from the  bench, as the inner corners of the shelves rest on these braces. Now  pull out the nails and set the stand on its feet.    Next put in the shelves. Place the inner corner of one on one of the  braces, and fasten it there with a screw put through the brace from the  bottom. Now fasten a clamp on each leg at the ends of the shelf in such  a manner as to form a support on the top side of the shelf. Then put  four screws through the shelf from the bottom into the legs. Repeat the  operation on each shelf, being careful to get them all the same height.  Four pieces like Fig. 3 should now be made. These pieces will have to be  fitted in place as they should slant outward so that it will be easy to  put articles through the holes. The holes should be about 5/8-in.  diameter.    The top can be made by cutting off two pieces from the 10-in. board,  each 20 in. long, and fastening them together with dowels. Smooth the  ends and be sure that the boards match evenly. It makes a better job to  glue the top together, in addition to the dowels, and, if you do this,  it would be better to make the top first. Then it will have time to dry  before you are ready to use it. In putting on the top, care should be  taken to get each of the corners an equal distance from the legs. Then a  screw may be put up through each one of the braces and two or three  through each leg into the top. Now smooth all rough and uneven places  with fine sandpaper and apply the finish. Secure some metal matchsafes  and scratchers, fasten on as shown in the photograph, and the stand is  complete.          A CHINA CLOSET      This beautiful piece of mission furniture can be made by anyone who has  a few good tools and knows how to use them. The cost is very moderate  and if you are convenient to a mill a great amount of labor can be saved  by ordering the pieces ready cut to length, squared, and sanded.  Quarter-sawed oak should be used and the material needed will be as  follows:      4 posts, 2 by 2 by 54 in., S-4-S.    2 top and bottom boards, 3/4 by 15-3/4 by 39-1/2 in., S-1-S.    2 shelves, 3/4 by 15-1/2 by 38 in., S-2-S.    2 lower end braces, 3/4 by 5 by 15 in., S-2-S.    2 upper end braces, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 15 in., S-2-S.    1 lower front board, 3/4 by 3 by 40 in., S-1-S.    1 upper front board, 3/4 by 2-1/4 by 40 in., S-1-S.    4 door frames, 3/4 by 1-3/4 by 43-1/2 in., S-2-S.    4 door frames, 3/4 by 2 by 19 in., S-2-S.    4 upright end pieces, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 39-1/2 in., S-2-S.    5 back pieces, 1/2 by 8 by 46-1/2 in., S-1-S.    2 cleats, 1 by 1 by 37-3/4 in., soft wood.    4 cleats, 1 by 1 by 12-3/4 in., soft wood.    4 blocks, 1/2 by 1 by 1-1/2 in.    First be sure the posts are perfectly square and of equal length. Either  chamfer or round the upper ends as desired. The mortises can be laid out  and cut, or they can be left until the tenons are all made and then  marked and cut directly from each tenon.    The top and bottom boards should have the corners cut to clear the posts  as shown in the drawing. The top board should be finished on both sides  and the bottom one on the upper side only "]]]
