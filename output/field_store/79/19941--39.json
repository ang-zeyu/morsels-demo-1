The stream rolled over and tore up the  soft, wet ground like chaff, so that it was dangerous to go near the  brink. While we were all quiet, we heard under our feet a sudden gurgling  and stirring, which betrayed the working of the disturbed water. Suddenly  our jagger, ever on the look-out, called loudly, and pointed to a singular  and unshapely object, which rose and sank.... Now we all hastened to the  spot on shore, had the boat drawn near, and waited until the mysterious  thing should again show itself. Our patience was tried, but at last a  black, horrible giant-like mass was thrust out of the water, and we beheld  a colossal elephant's head, armed with mighty tusks, with its long trunk  moving in the water in an unearthly manner, as though seeking for  something lost therein.... I beheld the monster hardly twelve feet from  me, with his half-open eyes yet showing the whites. It was still in good  preservation....    \"Picture to yourself an elephant with a body covered with thick fur, about  thirteen feet in height and fifteen in length, with tusks eight feet long,  thick, and curving outward at their ends, a stout trunk of six feet in  length, colossal limbs of one and a half feet in thickness, and a tail  naked up to the end, which was covered with thick tufty hair. The animal  was fat and well grown; death had overtaken him in the fulness of his  powers. His parchment-like, large, naked ears lay turned up over the head;  about the shoulders and on the back he had stiff hair, about a foot in  length, like a mane. The long outer hair was deep brown and coarsely  rooted. The top of the head looked so wild and so penetrated with pitch  that it resembled the rind of an old oak tree. On the sides it was  cleaner, and under the outer hair there appeared everywhere a wool, very  soft, warm and thick, and of a fallow-brown color. The giant was well  protected against the cold. The whole appearance of the animal was  fearfully strange and wild. It had not the shape of our present elephants.  As compared with our Indian elephants, its head was rough, the brain-case  low and narrow, but the trunk and mouth were much larger. The teeth were  very powerful. Our elephant is an awkward animal, but compared with this  mammoth, it is an Arabian steed to a coarse, ugly dray horse. I had the  stomach separated and brought on one side. It was well filled, and the  contents instructive and well preserved. The principal were young shoots  of the fir and pine; a quantity of young fir cones, also in a chewed  state, were mixed with the moss.\"    Mammoth bones are found in great abundance in the islands off the northern  coast of Siberia. The remains of the rhinoceros are also found. Pallas, in  1772, obtained from Wiljuiskoi, in latitude 64 deg., a rhinoceros taken from  the sand in which it had been frozen. This carcass emitted an odor like  putrid flesh, part of the skin being covered with short, crisp wool and  with black and gray hairs. Professor Brandt, in 1846, extracted from the  cavities in the molar teeth of this skeleton a small quantity of  half-chewed pine leaves and coniferous wood. And the blood-vessels in the  interior of the head appeared filled, even to the capillary vessels, with  coagulated blood, which in many places still retained its original red  color.    We find that Mr. Boyd Dawkins and Mr. Sanford assert that the cave-lion is  only a large variety of the existing lion--identical in species. Herodotus  says: \"The camels in the army of Xerxes, near the mountains of Thessaly,  _were attacked by lions_.\"    Sir John Lubbock, in his Prehistoric Times, page 293, says the cave-hyena  \"is now regarded as scarcely distinguishable specifically from the _Hyaena  crocuta_, or spotted hyena of Southern Africa,\" while Mr. Busk and M.  Gervais identify the _cave-bear_ with the _Ursus ferox_, or grizzly bear  of North America. What is the bearing of these facts on the question of  the antiquity of the remains found in the bone caverns?    Do these facts justify men in carrying human remains, found along with the  remains of these animals in the caves, back to the remote period of one or  two hundred thousand years?--a long time, this, for flesh upon the bones  and food in the stomach to remain in a state of preservation.    \"So fresh is the ivory throughout Northern Russia,\" says Lyell,  _Principles, vol. 1, p. 183_, \"that, according to Tilesius, thousands of  fossil tusks have been collected and used in turning.\"    Mr. Dawkins says: \"We are compelled to hold that the cave-lion which  preyed upon the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros and musk-sheep in Great  Britain, is a mere geographical variety of the great carnivore that is  found alike in the tropical parts of Asia and throughout the whole of  Africa.\" Popular Science Review for 1869, p. 153. It has been customary to  speak of all these animals as \"_the great extinct_ mammalia,\" and to  regard them all as much larger than existing animals of the same kind, but  three of the most important still exist, and the cave-lions, at least some  of the specimens, were smaller than the lion of the present. According to  Sir John Lubbock the \"Irish elk, the elephants and the three species of  rhinoceros are, perhaps, the only ones which are absolutely extinct.\"  Prehistoric Times, p. 290. \"Out of seventeen principal 'palaeolithic'  mammalia, ten, until recently, were regarded 'extinct;' but it is now  believed that the above-mentioned elk, elephants and rhinoceros are the  only extinct mammalia. Dr. Wilson affirms that skeletons of the Irish elk  have been found at Curragh, Ireland, in marshes, some of the bones of  which were in such fresh condition that the marrow is described as having  the appearance of fresh suet, and burning with a clear flame.\"    Professor Agassiz admits the continuance of the Irish elk to the  fourteenth century to be \"probable.\" It is certain that this elk continued  in Ireland down to what is claimed as the age of iron, and possibly in  Germany down to the twelfth century. It is also certain that it was a  companion of the mammoth and of the woolly rhinoceros. The aurochs, or  European bison, whose remains are found in the river gravel and the older  bone caves, is mentioned by Pliny and Seneca. They speak of it as existing  in their time; it is also named in the Niebelungen Lied. It existed in  Prussia as late as 1775, and is still found wild in the Caucasus. The  present Emperor of Russia has twelve herds, which are protected in the  forests of Lithuania. During the session of the International  Archaeological Congress at Stockholm, in 1874, the members of the body made  an excursion to the isle of Bjorko, in Lake Malar, near Stockholm, where  there is an ancient cemetery of two thousand tumuli. Within a few hundred  yards from this is the site of the ancient town. Several trenches were run  through this locality, and many relics obtained by the members of the  congress. On the occasion Dr. Stolpe, who was familiar with the previous  discoveries at this point, delivered a lecture on the island and its  remains. They all, he stated, belong to the second age of iron in Sweden,  and consisted of implements of iron, ornaments of bronze, and animal  bones; Kufic coins have been found, along with cowrie-shells, and silver  bracelets. The number of animal bones met with is immense, more than fifty  species being represented, and what is especially noteworthy, _the marrow  bones were all crushed or split_, just as in the palaeeolithic times. The  principal wild beasts were the lynx, the wolf, the fox, the beaver, the  elk, the _reindeer_, etc. Dr. Stolpe refers the formation of this  \"pre-historic\" city to \"about the middle of the eighth century after  Christ,\" and says it was probably destroyed \"about the middle of the  eleventh century.\"    \"During this period the reindeer existed in this part of Sweden.\"    Recent scientific discovery demands that we should almost modernize the  animals we used to regard as belonging to a period of a hundred thousand  years ago.    \"Scientists have been addicted to unwise and inconsiderate haste in the  announcement of new theories touching alleged facts; they have blundered  repeatedly in their efforts to confound the Christian and set aside Moses.  No less than eighty theories touching that many facts and discoveries have  been developed during the period of fifty years, that were brought before  the Institute of France in 1806, and not one of them survives to-day.\"  Truly the history of scientific investigation reveals the same fallibility  of human nature that is known in the many errors found in the line of  theological investigation. Truth, in science and religion, stands true to  her God--_man alone deviates_.            DRAPER'S CONFLICT BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE.      No one idea has produced a greater sensation among skeptics and  unbelievers than the idea of a conflict between science and Christianity.  The history of the affair reminds us of the ghost stories that frighten  people in their boyish days. There was, in truth, no foundation for the  sensation. Mr. Draper never intended that his work entitled \"Conflict  between Religion and Science,\" should be construed to mean Conflict  between the Bible and Science, or between Christianity, as set forth by  the primitive Christians and science, but conflict between apostate  religion and science; or, rather, between corruptors of the ancient  religion and science.    He says, \"I have had little to say respecting the two great Christian  confessions, the protestant and the Greek churches. As to the latter, it  has never, since the restoration of science, arrayed itself in opposition  to the advancement of knowledge. On the contrary, it has always met it  with welcome. It has observed a reverential attitude to truth, from  whatever quarter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#5)"],[1,"everyhow.    There were dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there  was cake, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a  great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies.    When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs.  Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and shaking  hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him  or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two  'prentices they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died  away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter  in the back-shop.    During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his  wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He  corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and  underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright  faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he  remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon  him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear.    \"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of  gratitude.\"    \"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.    The spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were  pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so  said,    \"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money:  three or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\"    \"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking  unconsciously like his former, not his latter self. \"It isn't that,  Spirit. He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our  service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power  lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it  is impossible to add and count 'em up; what then? The happiness he  gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.\"    He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.    \"What is the matter?\" asked the Ghost.    \"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.    \"Something, I think?\" the Ghost insisted.    \"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say a word or two  to my clerk just now. That's all.\"    His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish:  and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.    \"My time grows short,\" observed the Spirit. \"Quick!\"    This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but  it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was  older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and  rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care  and avarice. There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye,  which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of  the growing tree would fall.    He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a  mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the  light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.    \"It matters little,\" she said, softly. \"To you, very little. Another  idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to  come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.\"    \"What idol has displaced you?\" he rejoined.    \"A golden one.\"    \"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!\" he said. \"There is  nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it  professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!\"    \"You fear the world too much,\" she answered, gently. \"All your other  hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid  reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until  the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?\"    \"What then?\" he retorted. \"Even if I have grown so much wiser, what  then? I am not changed toward you.\"    She shook her head.    \"Am I?\"    \"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor and  content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly  fortune by our patient industry. You _are_ changed. When it was made,  you were another man.\"    \"I was a boy,\" he said impatiently.    \"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,\" she  returned. \"I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in  heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how  keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is enough that I  _have_ thought of it, and can release you.\"    \"Have I ever sought release?\"    \"In words. No. Never.\"    \"In what, then?\"    \"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of  life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of  any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,\"  said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; \"can even  I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl: or, choosing her, do I  not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and  I release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you once were.\"    He was about to speak; but she left him and they parted.    \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you  delight to torture me?\"    \"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\" said the  Ghost. \"That they are what they are, do not blame me!\"    \"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"I cannot bear it!\"    He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a  face, in which some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it  had shown him, wrestled with it.    \"Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!\"    In the struggle--if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost,  with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort  of its adversary--Scrooge was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome  by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own  bed-room. He had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy  sleep.      STAVE THREE.    THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS.      Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in  bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told  that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was  restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial  purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to  him through Jacob Marley's intervention. But, finding that he turned  uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this  new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own  hands, and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the  bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its  appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.    Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means  prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the bell struck One, and  no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling. Five  minutes, ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All  this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of  ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour;  and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as  he was powerless to make out what it meant. At last, however, he began  to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in  the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to  shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly  and shuffled in his slippers to the door.    The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by  his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.    It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had undergone  a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with  living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which,  bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe,  and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been  scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as  that dull petrifaction of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or  Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the  floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry,  brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,  mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red hot chestnuts,  cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears and immense  twelfth-cakes, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In  easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who  bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's horn, and held it  up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the  door.    \"Come in!\" exclaimed the Ghost \"Come in! and know me better, man!\"    Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. He was  not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were  clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.    \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,\" said the Spirit: \"Look upon me!  You have never seen the like of me before!\" exclaimed the Spirit.    \"Never,\" Scrooge made answer to it.    \"Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning  (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?\"  pursued the Phantom.    \"I don't think I have,\" said Scrooge. \"I am afraid I have not. Have you  had many brothers, Spirit?\"    \"More than eighteen hundred,\" said the Ghost.    \"A tremendous family to provide for,\" muttered Scrooge.    The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.    \"Spirit,\""]]]
