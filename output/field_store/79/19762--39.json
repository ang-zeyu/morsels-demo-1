The black-coated youth set up his cap  before, brought his heavy brows over his deep dark eyes, put his hands  in the pockets of his black plush breeches, and stepped a little  farther into the semicircle, immediately on his brother's right hand,  than he had ever ventured to do before. There he set himself firm on  his legs, and, with a face as demure as death, seemed determined to  keep his ground. He pretended to be following the ball with his eyes;  but every moment they were glancing aside at George. One of the  competitors chanced to say rashly, in the moment of exultation, \"That's  a d--d fine blow, George!\" On which the intruder took up the word, as  characteristic of the competitors, and repeated it every stroke that  was given, making such a ludicrous use of it that several of the  onlookers were compelled to laugh immoderately; but the players were  terribly nettled at it, as he really contrived, by dint of sliding in  some canonical terms, to render the competitors and their game  ridiculous.    But matters at length came to a crisis that put them beyond sport.  George, in flying backward to gain the point at which the ball was  going to light, came inadvertently so rudely in contact with this  obstreperous interloper that lie not only overthrew him, but also got a  grievous fall over his legs; and, as he arose, the other made a spurn  at him with his foot, which, if it had hit to its aim, would  undoubtedly have finished the course of the young laird of Dalcastle  and Balgrennan. George, being irritated beyond measure, as may well be  conceived, especially at the deadly stroke aimed at him, struck the  assailant with his racket, rather slightly, but so that his mouth and  nose gushed out blood; and, at the same time, he said, turning to his  cronies: \"Does any of you know who the infernal puppy is?\"    \"Do you know, Sir?\" said one of the onlookers, a stranger, \"the  gentleman is your own brother, Sir--Mr. Robert Wringhim Colwan!\"    \"No, not Colwan, Sir,\" said Robert, putting his hands in his pockets,  and setting himself still farther forward than before, \"not a Colwan,  Sir; henceforth I disclaim the name.\"    \"No, certainly not,\" repeated George. \"My mother's son you may be--but  not a Colwan! There you are right.\" Then, turning around to his  informer, he said: \"Mercy be about us, Sir! Is this the crazy  minister's son from Glasgow?\"    This question was put in the irritation of the moment, but it was too  rude, and far too out of place, and no one deigned any answer to it. He  felt the reproof, and felt it deeply; seeming anxious for some  opportunity to make an acknowledgment, or some reparation.    In the meantime, young Wringhim was an object to all of the uttermost  disgust. The blood flowing from his mouth and nose he took no pains to  stem, neither did he so much as wipe it away; so that it spread over  all his cheeks, and breast, even off at his toes. In that state did he  take up his station in the middle of the competitors; and he did not  now keep his place, but ran about, impeding everyone who attempted to  make at the ball. They loaded him with execrations, but it availed  nothing; he seemed courting persecution and buffetings, keeping  steadfastly to his old joke of damnation, and marring the game so  completely that, in spite of every effort on the part of the players,  he forced them to stop their game and give it up. He was such a  rueful-looking object, covered with blood, that none of them had the  heart to kick him, although it appeared the only thing he wanted; and,  as for George, he said not another word to him, either in anger or  reproof.    When the game was fairly given up, and the party were washing their  hands in the stone fount, some of them besought Robert Wringhim to wash  himself; but he mocked at them, and said he was much better as he was.  George, at length, came forward abashedly towards him, and said: \"I  have been greatly to blame, Robert, and am very sorry for what I have  done. But, in the first instance, I erred through ignorance, not  knowing you were my brother, which you certainly are; and, in the  second, through a momentary irritation, for which I am ashamed. I pray  you, therefore, to pardon me, and give me your hand.\"    As he said this, he held out his hand towards his polluted brother; but  the froward predestinarian took not his from his breeches pocket, but  lifting his foot, he gave his brother's hand a kick. \"I'll give you  what will suit such a hand better than mine,\" said he, with a sneer.  And then, turning lightly about, he added: \"Are there to be no more of  these d---d fine blows, gentlemen? For shame, to give up such a  profitable and edifying game!\"    \"This is too bad,\" said George. \"But, since it is thus, I have the less  to regret.\" And, having made this general remark, he took no more note  of the uncouth aggressor. But the persecution of the latter terminated  not on the play-ground: he ranked up among them, bloody and disgusting  as he was, and, keeping close by his brother's side, he marched along  with the party all the way to the Black Bull. Before they got there, a  great number of boys and idle people had surrounded them, hooting and  incommoding them exceedingly, so that they were glad to get into the  inn; and the unaccountable monster actually tried to get in alongst  with them, to make one of the party at dinner. But the innkeeper and  his men, getting the hint, by force prevented him from entering,  although he attempted it again and again, both by telling lies and  offering a bribe. Finding he could not prevail, he set to exciting the  mob at the door to acts of violence; in which he had like to have  succeeded. The landlord had no other shift, at last, but to send  privately for two officers, and have him carried to the guard-house;  and the hilarity and joy of the party of young gentlemen, for the  evening, was quite spoiled by the inauspicious termination of their  game.    The Rev. Robert Wringhim was now to send for, to release his beloved  ward. The messenger found him at table, with a number of the leaders of  the Whig faction, the Marquis of Annandale being in the chair; and, the  prisoner's note being produced, Wringhim read it aloud, accompanying it  with some explanatory remarks. The circumstances of the case being thus  magnified and distorted, it excited the utmost abhorrence, both of the  deed and the perpetrators, among the assembled faction. They declaimed  against the act as an unnatural attempt on the character, and even the  life, of an unfortunate brother, who had been expelled from his  father's house. And, as party spirit was the order of the day, an  attempt was made to lay the burden of it to that account. In short, the  young culprit got some of the best blood of the land to enter as his  securities, and was set at liberty. But, when Wringhim perceived the  plight that he was in, he took him, as he was, and presented him to his  honourable patrons. This raised the indignation against the young laird  and his associates a thousand-fold, which actually roused the party to  temporary madness. They were, perhaps, a little excited by the wine and  spirits they had swallowed; else a casual quarrel between two young  men, at tennis, could not have driven them to such extremes. But  certain it is that, from one at first arising to address the party on  the atrocity of the offence, both in a moral and political point of  view, on a sudden there were six on their feet, at the same time,  expatiating on it; and, in a very short time thereafter, everyone in  the room was up talking with the utmost vociferation, all on the same  subject, and all taking the same side in the debate.    In the midst of this confusion, someone or other issued from the house,  which was at the back of the Canongate, calling out: \"A plot, a plot!  Treason, treason! Down with the bloody incendiaries at the Black Bull!\"    The concourse of people that were assembled in Edinburgh at that time  was prodigious; and, as they were all actuated by political motives,  they wanted only a ready-blown coal to set the mountain on fire. The  evening being fine, and the streets thronged, the cry ran from mouth to  mouth through the whole city. More than that, the mob that had of late  been gathered to the door of the Black Bull had, by degrees, dispersed;  but, they being young men, and idle vagrants, they had only spread  themselves over the rest of the street to lounge in search of further  amusement: consequently, a word was sufficient to send them back to  their late rendezvous, where they had previously witnessed something  they did not much approve of.    The master of the tavern was astonished at seeing the mob again  assembling; and that with such hurry and noise. But, his inmates being  all of the highest respectability, he judged himself sure of  protection, or at least of indemnity. He had two large parties in his  house at the time; the largest of which was of the Revolutionist  faction. The other consisted of our young Tennis-players, and their  associates, who were all of the Jacobite order; or, at all events,  leaned to the Episcopal side. The largest party were in a front room;  and the attack of the mob fell first on their windows, though rather  with fear and caution. Jingle went one pane; then a loud hurrah; and  that again was followed by a number of voices, endeavouring to restrain  the indignation from venting itself in destroying the windows, and to  turn it on the inmates. The Whigs, calling the landlord, inquired what  the assault meant: he cunningly answered that he suspected it was some  of the youths of the Cavalier, or High-Church party, exciting the mob  against them. The party consisted mostly of young gentlemen, by that  time in a key to engage in any row; and, at all events, to suffer  nothing from the other party, against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22766"],[0,"Electricity for Boys (#5)"],[1,"pole.    WHY THE COMPASS POINTS NORTH AND SOUTH.--Now, let us try to ascertain  why the compass points north and south.    Let us assume that we have a large magnet (A, Fig. 10), and suspend a  small magnet (B) above it, so that it is within the magnetic field of  the large magnet. This may be done by means of a short pin (C), which is  located in the middle of the magnet (B), the upper end of this pin  having thereon a loop to which a thread (D) is attached. The pin also  carries thereon a pointer (E), which is directed toward the north pole  of the bar (B).    [Illustration: _Fig. 9._ EARTH'S MAGNETIC LINES]    You will now take note of the interior magnetic lines (X), and the  exterior magnetic lines (Z) of the large magnet (A), and compare the  direction of their flow with the similar lines in the small magnet (B).    The small magnet has both its exterior and its interior lines within the  exterior lines (Z) of the large magnet (A), so that as the small magnet  (B) is capable of swinging around, the N pole of the bar (B) will point  toward the S pole of the larger bar (A). The small bar, therefore, is  influenced by the exterior magnetic field (Z).    [Illustration: _Fig. 10._ TWO PERMANENT MAGNETS]    [Illustration: _Fig. 11._ MAGNETS IN THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD]    Let us now take the outline represented by the earth's surface (Fig.  11), and suspend a magnet (A) at any point, like the needle of a  compass, and it will be seen that the needle will arrange itself north  and south, within the magnetic field which flows from the north to the  south pole.    PECULIARITY OF A MAGNET.--One characteristic of a magnet is that, while  apparently the magnetic field flows out at one end of the magnet, and  moves inwardly at the other end, the power of attraction is just the  same at both ends.    In Fig. 12 are shown a bar (A) and a horseshoe magnet (B). The bar (A)  has metal blocks (C) at each end, and each of these blocks is attracted  to and held in contact with the ends by magnetic influence, just the  same as the bar (D) is attracted by and held against the two ends of the  horseshoe magnet. These blocks (C) or the bar (D) are called armatures.  Through them is represented the visible motion produced by the magnetic  field.    [Illustration: _Fig. 12._ ARMATURES FOR MAGNETS]    ACTION OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNET.--The electro-magnet exerts its force in  the same manner as a permanent magnet, so far as attraction and  repulsion are concerned, and it has a north and a south pole, as in the  case with the permanent magnet. An electro-magnet is simply a bar of  iron with a coil or coils of wire around it; when a current of  electricity flows through the wire, the bar is magnetized. The moment  the current is cut off, the bar is demagnetized. The question that now  arises is, why an electric current flowing through a wire, under those  conditions, magnetizes the bar, or _core_, as it is called.    [Illustration: _Fig. 13._ MAGNETIZED FIELD]    [Illustration: _Fig. 14._ MAGNETIZED BAR]    In Fig. 13 is shown a piece of wire (A). Let us assume that a current of  electricity is flowing through this wire in the direction of the darts.  What actually takes place is that the electricity extends out beyond the  surface of the wire in the form of the closed rings (B). If, now, this  wire (A) is wound around an iron core (C, Fig. 14), you will observe  that this electric field, as it is called, entirely surrounds the core,  or rather, that the core is within the magnetic field or influence of  the current flowing through the wire, and the core (C) thereby becomes  magnetized, but it is magnetized only when the current passes through  the wire coil (A).    [Illustration: _Fig. 15._ DIRECTION OF CURRENT]    From the foregoing, it will be understood that a wire carrying a current  of electricity not only is affected within its body, but that it also  has a sphere of influence exteriorly to the body of the wire, at all  points; and advantage is taken of this phenomenon in constructing  motors, dynamos, electrical measuring devices and almost every kind of  electrical mechanism in existence.    EXTERIOR MAGNETIC INFLUENCE AROUND A WIRE CARRYING A CURRENT.--Bear in  mind that the wire coil (A, Fig. 14) does not come into contact with the  core (C). It is insulated from the core, either by air or by rubber or  other insulating substance, and a current passing from A to C under  those conditions is a current of _induction_. On the other hand, the  current flowing through the wire (A) from end to end is called a  _conduction_ current. Remember these terms.    In this connection there is also another thing which you will do well to  bear in mind. In Fig. 15 you will notice a core (C) and an insulated  wire coil (B) wound around it. The current, through the wire (B), as  shown by the darts (D), moves in one direction, and the induced current  in the core (C) travels in the opposite direction, as shown by the darts  (D).    [Illustration: _Fig. 16._ DIRECTION OF INDUCTION CURRENT]    PARALLEL WIRES.--In like manner, if two wires (A, B, Fig. 16) are  parallel with each other, and a current of electricity passes along the  wire (A) in one direction, the induced current in the wire (B) will move  in the opposite direction.    These fundamental principles should be thoroughly understood and  mastered.          CHAPTER IV    FRICTIONAL, VOLTAIC OR GALVANIC, AND ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ELECTRICITY      THREE ELECTRICAL SOURCES.--It has been found that there are three kinds  of electricity, or, to be more accurate, there are three ways to  generate it. These will now be described.    When man first began experimenting, he produced a current by frictional  means, and collected the electricity in a bottle or jar. Electricity, so  stored, could be drawn from the jar, by attaching thereto suitable  connection. This could be effected only in one way, and that was by  discharging the entire accumulation instantaneously. At that time they  knew of no means whereby the current could be made to flow from the jar  as from a battery or cell.    FRICTIONAL ELECTRICITY.--With a view of explaining the principles  involved, we show in Fig. 17 a machine for producing electricity by  friction.      [Illustration: _Fig. 17._ FRICTION-ELECTRICITY MACHINE]    This is made up as follows: A represents the base, having thereon a flat  member (B), on which is mounted a pair of parallel posts or standards  (C, C), which are connected at the top by a cross piece (D). Between  these two posts is a glass disc (E), mounted upon a shaft (F), which  passes through the posts, this shaft having at one end a crank (G). Two  leather collecting surfaces (H, H), which are in contact with the glass  disc (E), are held in position by arms (I, J), the arm (I) being  supported by the cross piece (D), and the arm (J) held by the base piece  (B). A rod (K), U-shaped in form, passes over the structure here thus  described, its ends being secured to the base (B). The arms (I, J) are  both electrically connected with this rod, or conductor (K), joined to a  main conductor (L), which has a terminating knob (M). On each side and  close to the terminal end of each leather collector (H) is a fork-shaped  collector (N). These two collectors are also connected electrically with  the conductor (K). When the disc is turned electricity is generated by  the leather flaps and accumulated by the collectors (N), after which it  is ready to be discharged at the knob (M).    In order to collect the electricity thus generated a vessel called a  Leyden jar is used.    LEYDEN JAR.--This is shown in Fig. 18. The jar (A) is of glass coated  exteriorly at its lower end with tinfoil (B), which extends up a little  more than halfway from the bottom. This jar has a wooden cover or top  (C), provided centrally with a hole (D). The jar is designed to receive  within it a tripod and standard (E) of lead. Within this lead standard  is fitted a metal rod (F), which projects upwardly through the hole (D),  its upper end having thereon a terminal knob (G). A sliding cork (H) on  the rod (F) serves as a means to close the jar when not in use. When in  use this cork is raised so the rod may not come into contact,  electrically, with the cover (C).    The jar is half filled with sulphuric acid (I), after which, in order  to charge the jar, the knob (G) is brought into contact with the knob  (M) of the friction generator (Fig. 17).    VOLTAIC OR GALVANIC ELECTRICITY.--The second method of generating  electricity is by chemical means, so called, because a liquid is used as  one of the agents.    [Illustration: _Fig. 18._ LEYDEN JAR]    Galvani, in 1790, made the experiments which led to the generation of  electricity by means of liquids and metals. The first battery was called  the \"crown of cups,\" shown in Fig. 19, and consisting of a row of glass  cups (A), containing salt water. These cups were electrically connected  by means of bent metal strips (B), each strip having at one end a copper  plate (C), and at the other end a zinc plate (D). The first plate in the  cup at one end is connected with the last plate in the cup at the other  end by a conductor (E) to make a complete circuit.    [Illustration: _Fig. 19._ GALVANIC ELECTRICITY. CROWN OF CUPS]    THE CELL AND BATTERY.--From the foregoing it will be seen that within  each cup the current flows from the zinc to the copper plates, and  exteriorly from the copper to the zinc plates through the conductors (B  and E).    A few years afterwards Volta devised what is known as the voltaic pile  (Fig. 20).    VOLTAIC PILE--HOW MADE.--This is made of alternate discs of copper and  zinc with a piece of cardboard of corresponding size between each zinc  and copper plate. The cardboard discs are moistened with acidulated  water. The bottom disc of copper has a strip which connects with a cup  of acid, and one wire terminal (A) runs therefrom. The upper disc, which  is of zinc, is"]]]
