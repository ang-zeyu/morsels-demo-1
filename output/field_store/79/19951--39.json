A thin, blue,  hot-scented but cool, vapor was the thing to strive for then. There were  folk who suggested furnaces--with smoke pipes leading in--ever so much  safer they said, withal much less trouble. Why! even the smoke from a  cooking stove might be made to answer. But these progressives were heard  coldly--the old timers knew in right of tradition and experience, the  need of well ventilated smoke.    It gave this present chronicler a feeling of getting home again, to walk  through the curing rooms of perhaps the most famous bacon makers in the  world, and find them practicing the wisdom of her childhood. Namely  using hickory smoke not delivered from furnace pipes but welling up, up,  in beautiful wreathy spirals, to reach row on row of hams and  flitches--and to be told, by a kind person who did not know she already  knew, that their curing was patterned on the old English model--curing  in the smoke of great-throated stone hall chimneys. Yes--they had tried  pipes--furnaces likewise--but they gave too much heat, did not  distribute smoke evenly, besides being almost impossible of regulation.  Hence the smoldering hickory that was like a breath from a far past.    Notwithstanding, the chronicler is of opinion that folk who would like  to try their hands at bacon making may do it with a fair hope without  building regular smoke houses. To such she would say, get a stout  hogshead--a sugar hogshead preferable--nail on a board roof to shed  water, then set it upon a stout frame at least seven feet above ground.  Nail inside it stout cleats, to hold the cross bars for the meat. Hang  the meat upon them--but not until the hogshead is in place. Cut a hole  in the bottom as big as the top of a large barrel. Working through this  hole, arrange the meat, then put below a headless barrel, the top  resting against the hogshead-heading, the bottom upon supports of gas  pipe, iron, or even piled bricks. Between the supports set an iron  vessel--build your hickory smoke-fires in it, smothering them carefully,  and letting the smoke, with a sufficiency of air, well up, through  barrel, hogshead, etc. Or one might even rig up a smoking hogshead in an  attic, providing the chimney were tall enough to cool smoke  properly--and lead smoke out to it through a length of drain pipe.    These are but suggestions--the contriving mind will doubtless invent  other and better ones. Smoking must go on for five weeks at least. Six  will be better, slacking toward the end. But two may be made to answer  by the use of what is called \"liquid smoke\" whose other name is crude  pyroligneous acid. A product of wood distillation, it has been proved  harmless in use, but use is nevertheless forbidden to commercial makers.  The meat, after breaking bulk, is dipped in it three times at fairly  brief intervals, hung up, drained, and smoked. From the liquid smoke it  will have acquired as much acid saving-grace, as from four weeks of old  fashioned smoking.    A smokehouse needs to be kept dark, dry, and cool, also well ventilated.  Use fine screen wire over all openings, and make windows very small,  with coarse, sleazy crash in the sash rather than glass inside the  screens. Darkness prevents or discourages the maggot-fly. To discourage  him still further cover the cut sides of hams and shoulders before  hanging up with molasses made very thick with ground black pepper. They  will not absolutely require canvassing and dipping in whitewash after if  the peppering is thorough. But to be on the safe side--canvas and dip.  Make the whitewash with a foundation of thick paste--and be sure it  covers every thread of the canvas. Hams perfectly cured and canvassed  keep indefinitely in the right sort of smokehouse--but there is not much  gain in flavor after they are three years old.    In rendering lard try out leaf fat to itself--it yields the very finest.  Cut out the kidneys carefully, and remove any bit of lean, then pull  off the thin inner skin, and cut up the leaves--into bits about two  inches wide and four long. Wash these quickly in tepid water, drain on a  sieve, and put over a slow fire in an iron vessel rather thick bottomed.  Add a little cold water--a cupful to a gallon of cut up fat, and let  cook gently until the lumps of fat color faintly. Increase heat till  there is a mild bubbling--keep the bubbling steady, stirring often to  make sure no lump of fat sticks to the pot and scorches, until all the  lumps are crisp brown cracklings. Bright brown, not dark--if dark the  lard will be slightly colored. Scorching taints and ruins the whole  mass. Strain through a sieve into a clean tin vessel, newly scalded and  wiped dry. Put the cracklings into a bag of stout crash, and press hard  between two clean boards, till no more fat runs from them. A jelly press  comes in handy, but is not essential. If weak, clear lye, made of green  wood ashes, is put in with the fat instead of water at the beginning,  the fat-yield will be greater, and the bulk of cracklings less, also  more nearly disintegrated.    Other fat is tried out in the same way, taking care to remove all skin  and cut away streaks of lean. Bits with much lean in them had better go  to the sausage mill--the right proportion there is two pounds of fat to  three and a half of lean. Mix well in grinding, and remove all strings,  gristle, etc. Seasoning is so much a matter of taste, do it very lightly  at first--then fry a tiny cake, test it, and add whatever it seems to  lack or need. Be rather sparing of salt--eaters can put it in but can  not take it out, and excess of it makes even new sausage taste old. A  good combination of flavors, one approved by experience, is a cupful of  powdered and sifted sage, an ounce of black pepper newly ground, and  very fine, a tablespoonful of powdered red pepper, a teaspoonful of  cayenne, a pinch of thyme in fine powder, a dozen cloves, as many grains  of alspice, beaten fine, a teaspoonful of moist sugar, and a blade of  mace in fine powder. Omit the mace, cloves, etc. if the flavor repels.  Mix all well together, then work evenly through the meat. This seasoning  should suffice for five pounds of ground meat lightly salted. More can  be used by those who like high and pronounced flavors.    Scrape feet very clean, and take off hoofs by either dipping in scalding  hot lye, or hot wet wood ashes. Wash very clean after scraping, throw in  cold water, soak an hour, then put in a clean pot with plenty of cold  water, and boil gently until very tender. If boiling for souse cook till  the meat and gristle fall from the bones. If for frying, take up the  feet as soon as they are tender, keeping them in shape. Boil heads the  same way, taking out eyes, cutting off ears and cleaning them carefully  inside. Pick the meat from the bones, mix it with the feet also picked  up, work seasoning well through it--salt, black and red pepper, herbs if  approved, likewise a trifle of onion juice, then pack in deep molds,  pour over a little of the boiling liquor--barely enough to moisten--and  set to cool uncovered.    Let the boiling liquor stand until cold, covered only with a cloth. Skim  off the oil--hog's foot oil is a fine dressing for any sort of  leather--then dip off carefully the jelly underneath. Do not disturb the  sediment--take only the clear jelly. Melted, clarified with white of  egg, seasoned with wine, lemon juice, or grape juice, and sufficiently  sugared, the result puts all gelatines of commerce clean out of court.  Indeed any receipt for gelatine desserts can be used with the hog's foot  jelly. A small salvage perhaps--but worth while.    Everybody knows brains can be fried--just as all know they can be  addled. We of the old south pickled ours. Go and do likewise if you want  an experience. Begin by scalding the brains--putting them on in cold  water very slightly salted, then letting them barely strike a boil. Skim  out, drop in cold water, take off the skin, keeping the lobes as whole  as possible, lay in a porcelain kettle, spice liberally with black and  red pepper, cloves, nutmeg and allspice, cover with strong vinegar,  bring to a boil, cook five minutes, then put in a jar, cool uncovered,  tie down and let stand a week before using. Thus treated brains will  keep for six weeks, provided they are kept cool.    We also pickled our souse--cutting it in thin slices, and laying them in  strong vinegar an hour before serving. Another way was to melt the souse  into a sort of rich hash--beaten eggs were occasionally added, and the  result served on hot toast. At a pinch it answered for the foundation of  a meat pie, putting in with it in layers, sliced hard boiled eggs,  sliced cucumber pickle, plenty of seasoning, a good lump of butter, and  a little water. The pie was baked quickly--and made a very good supper  dish if unexpected company overran the supply of sausage or chicken for  frying.    But fried hog's feet were nearly the best of hog killing. After boiling  tender, the feet were split lengthwise in half, rolled in sifted  cornmeal, salted and peppered, and fried crisp in plenty of boiling hot  fat. Served with hot biscuit, and stewed sun-dried peaches, along with  strong coffee, brown and fragrant, they made a supper or breakfast one  could rejoice in.    Backbone stewed, and served with sweet potatoes, hot corn bread, and  sparkling cider, was certainly not to be despised. The stewing was  gentle, the seasoning well blended--enough salt but not too much, red  and black pepper, and the merest dash of pepper vinegar. Many cooks left  the vinegar to be added in the plates. There was little water at the  beginning, and next to none at the end--the kettle was kept well  covered, and not allowed to boil over. Backbone pie held its own with  chicken pie--indeed there were those who preferred it. It was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497"],[0,"Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas (#5)"],[1,"of princes and heroes. As all the gods  were supposed to be descended from him, he was surnamed Allfather,  and as eldest and chief among them he occupied the highest seat in  Asgard. Known by the name of Hlidskialf, this chair was not only an  exalted throne, but also a mighty watch-tower, from whence he could  overlook the whole world and see at a glance all that was happening  among gods, giants, elves, dwarfs, and men.          \"From the hall of Heaven he rode away      To Lidskialf, and sate upon his throne,      The mount, from whence his eye surveys the world.      And far from Heaven he turned his shining orbs      To look on Midgard, and the earth, and men.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).        Odin's Personal Appearance    None but Odin and his wife and queen Frigga were privileged to use  this seat, and when they occupied it they generally gazed towards  the south and west, the goal of all the hopes and excursions of the  Northern nations. Odin was generally represented as a tall, vigorous  man, about fifty years of age, either with dark curling hair or with  a long grey beard and bald head. He was clad in a suit of grey, with  a blue hood, and his muscular body was enveloped in a wide blue mantle  flecked with grey--an emblem of the sky with its fleecy clouds. In his  hand Odin generally carried the infallible spear Gungnir, which was  so sacred that an oath sworn upon its point could never be broken,  and on his finger or arm he wore the marvellous ring, Draupnir, the  emblem of fruitfulness, precious beyond compare. When seated upon  his throne or armed for the fray, to mingle in which he would often  descend to earth, Odin wore his eagle helmet; but when he wandered  peacefully about the earth in human guise, to see what men were doing,  he generally donned a broad-brimmed hat, drawn low over his forehead  to conceal the fact that he possessed but one eye.    Two ravens, Hugin (thought) and Munin (memory), perched upon his  shoulders as he sat upon his throne, and these he sent out into the  wide world every morning, anxiously watching for their return at  nightfall, when they whispered into his ears news of all they had  seen and heard. Thus he was kept well informed about everything that  was happening on earth.          \"Hugin and Munin      Fly each day      Over the spacious earth.      I fear for Hugin      That he come not back,      Yet more anxious am I for Munin.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      At his feet crouched two wolves or hunting hounds, Geri and Freki,  animals which were therefore considered sacred to him, and of good omen  if met by the way. Odin always fed these wolves with his own hands  from meat set before him. He required no food at all for himself,  and seldom tasted anything except the sacred mead.          \"Geri and Freki      The war-wont sates,      The triumphant sire of hosts;      But on wine only      The famed in arms      Odin, ever lives.\"                Lay of Grimnir (Thorpe's tr.).      When seated in state upon his throne, Odin rested his feet upon a  footstool of gold, the work of the gods, all of whose furniture and  utensils were fashioned either of that precious metal or of silver.    Besides the magnificent hall Glads-heim, where stood the twelve seats  occupied by the gods when they met in council, and Valaskialf, where  his throne, Hlidskialf, was placed, Odin had a third palace in Asgard,  situated in the midst of the marvellous grove Glasir, whose shimmering  leaves were of red gold.        Valhalla    This palace, called Valhalla (the hall of the chosen slain), had five  hundred and forty doors, wide enough to allow the passage of eight  hundred warriors abreast, and above the principal gate were a boar's  head and an eagle whose piercing glance penetrated to the far corners  of the world. The walls of this marvellous building were fashioned  of glittering spears, so highly polished that they illuminated the  hall. The roof was of golden shields, and the benches were decorated  with fine armour, the god's gifts to his guests. Here long tables  afforded ample accommodation for the Einheriar, warriors fallen in  battle, who were specially favoured by Odin.          \"Easily to be known is,      By those who to Odin come,      The mansion by its aspect.      Its roof with spears is laid,      Its hall with shields is decked,      With corselets are its benches strewed.\"                Lay of Grimnir (Thorpe's tr.).      The ancient Northern nations, who deemed warfare the most honourable  of occupations, and considered courage the greatest virtue, worshipped  Odin principally as god of battle and victory. They believed that  whenever a fight was impending he sent out his special attendants,  the shield-, battle-, or wish-maidens, called Valkyrs (choosers of the  slain), who selected from the dead warriors one-half of their number,  whom they bore on their fleet steeds over the quivering rainbow bridge,  Bifroest, into Valhalla. Welcomed by Odin's sons, Hermod and Bragi,  the heroes were conducted to the foot of Odin's throne, where they  received the praise due to their valour. When some special favourite  of the god was thus brought into Asgard, Valfather (father of the  slain), as Odin was called when he presided over the warriors, would  sometimes rise from his throne and in person bid him welcome at the  great entrance gate.        The Feast of the Heroes    Besides the glory of such distinction, and the enjoyment of Odin's  beloved presence day after day, other more material pleasures awaited  the warriors in Valhalla. Generous entertainment was provided for  them at the long tables, where the beautiful white-armed virgins,  the Valkyrs, having laid aside their armour and clad themselves in  pure white robes, waited upon them with assiduous attention. These  maidens, nine in number according to some authorities, brought  the heroes great horns full of delicious mead, and set before them  huge portions of boar's flesh, upon which they feasted heartily. The  usual Northern drink was beer or ale, but our ancestors fancied this  beverage too coarse for the heavenly sphere. They therefore imagined  that Valfather kept his table liberally supplied with mead or hydromel,  which was daily furnished in great abundance by his she-goat Heidrun,  who continually browsed on the tender leaves and twigs on Lerad,  Yggdrasil's topmost branch.          \"Rash war and perilous battle, their delight;      And immature, and red with glorious wounds,      Unpeaceful death their choice: deriving thence      A right to feast and drain immortal bowls,      In Odin's hall; whose blazing roof resounds      The genial uproar of those shades who fall      In desperate fight, or by some brave attempt.\"                Liberty (James Thomson).      The meat upon which the Einheriar feasted was the flesh of the divine  boar Saehrimnir, a marvellous beast, daily slain by the cook Andhrimnir,  and boiled in the great cauldron Eldhrimnir; but although Odin's  guests had true Northern appetites and gorged themselves to the full,  there was always plenty of meat for all.          \"Andhrimnir cooks      In Eldhrimnir      Saehrimnir;      'Tis the best of flesh;      But few know      What the einherjes eat.\"                Lay of Grimnir (Anderson's version).      Moreover, the supply was exhaustless, for the boar always came to  life again before the time of the next meal. This miraculous renewal  of supplies in the larder was not the only wonderful occurrence in  Valhalla, for it is related that the warriors, after having eaten and  drunk to satiety, always called for their weapons, armed themselves,  and rode out into the great courtyard, where they fought against one  another, repeating the feats of arms for which they were famed on  earth, and recklessly dealing terrible wounds, which, however, were  miraculously and completely healed as soon as the dinner horn sounded.          \"All the chosen guests of Odin      Daily ply the trade of war;      From the fields of festal fight      Swift they ride in gleaming arms,      And gaily, at the board of gods,      Quaff the cup of sparkling ale      And eat Saehrimni's vaunted flesh.\"                Vafthrudni's-mal (W. Taylor's tr.).      Whole and happy at the sound of the horn, and bearing one another  no grudge for cruel thrusts given and received, the Einheriar would  ride gaily back to Valhalla to renew their feasts in Odin's beloved  presence, while the white-armed Valkyrs, with flying hair, glided  gracefully about, constantly filling their horns or their favourite  drinking vessels, the skulls of their enemies, while the scalds sang  of war and of stirring Viking forays.          \"And all day long they there are hack'd and hewn      'Mid dust, and groans, and limbs lopped off, and blood;      But all at night return to Odin's hall      Woundless and fresh: such lot is theirs in heaven.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      Fighting and feasting thus, the heroes were said to spend their days  in perfect bliss, while Odin delighted in their strength and number,  which, however, he foresaw would not avail to prevent his downfall  when the day of the last battle should dawn.    As such pleasures were the highest a Northern warrior's fancy could  paint, it was very natural that all fighting men should love Odin, and  early in life should dedicate themselves to his service. They vowed  to die arms in hand, if possible, and even wounded themselves with  their own spears when death drew near, if they had been unfortunate  enough to escape death on the battlefield and were threatened with  \"straw death,\" as they called decease from old age or sickness.          \"To Odin then true-fast      Carves he fair runics,--      Death-runes cut deep on his arm and his breast.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      In reward for this devotion Odin watched"]]]
