I never lived on a farm or plantation in  my life. I know nothing about farming. All my people are dead and I  cannot locate any of marster's family if they are living. Marster's  family consisted of two boys and two girls--Willie, Frank, Lucy and  Sallie. Marster was a merchant, selling general merchandise. I remember  eating a lot of brown sugar and candy at his store.    My mother was a cook. They allowed us a lot of privileges and it was  just one large happy family with plenty to eat and wear, good sleeping  places and nothing to worry about. They were of the Presbyterian faith  and we slaves attended Sunday school and services at their church. There  were about twelve slaves on the lot. The houses for slaves were built  just a little ways back from marster's house on the same lot. The Negro  and white children played together, and there was little if any  difference made in the treatment given a slave child and a white child.  I have religious books they gave me. Besides the books they taught me,  they drilled me in etiquette of the times and also in courtesy and  respect to my superiors until it became a habit and it was perfectly  natural for me to be polite.    The first I knew of the Yankees was when I was out in my marster's yard  picking up chips and they came along, took my little brother and put him  on a horse's back and carried him up town. I ran and told my mother  about it. They rode brother over the town a while, having fun out of  him, then they brought him back. Brother said he had a good ride and was  pleased with the blue jackets as the Yankee soldiers were called.    We had all the silver and valuables hid and the Yankees did not find  them, but they went into marster's store and took what they wanted. They  gave my father a box of hardtack and a lot of meat. Father was a  Christian and he quoted one of the Commandments when they gave him  things they had stolen from others. 'Thou shalt not steal', quoth he,  and he said he did not appreciate having stolen goods given to him.    I traveled with the white folks in both sections of the country, north  and south, after the _War Between the States_. I kept traveling with them  and also continued my education. They taught me to recite and I made  money by reciting on many of the trips. Since the surrender I have  traveled in the north for various Charitable Negro Societies and  Institutions and people seemed very much interested in the recitation I  recited called \"When Malinda Sings\".    The first school I attended was after the war closed. The school was  located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and was taught by a Yankee white  woman from Philadelphia. We remained in Chapel Hill only a few years  after the war ended when we all moved to Raleigh, and I have made it my  home ever since. I got the major part of my education in Raleigh under  Dr. H. M. Tupper[1] who taught in the second Baptist Church, located on  Blount Street. Miss Mary Lathrop, a colored teacher from Philadelphia,  was an assistant teacher in Dr. Tupper's School. I went from there to  Shaw Collegiate Institute, which is now Shaw University.    I married Aaron Stallings of Warrenton, North Carolina while at Shaw.  He died and I married Rev. Matthews Anngady of Monrovia, west coast of  Africa, Liberia, Pastor of First Church. I helped him in his work here,  kept studying the works of different authors, and lecturing and  reciting. My husband, the Rev. Matthews Anngady died, and I gave a lot  of my time to the cause of Charity, and while on a lecture tour of  Massachusetts in the interest of this feature of colored welfare for  Richmond, Va., the most colorful incident of my eventful life happened  when I met Quango Hennadonah Perceriah, an Abyssinian Prince, who was  traveling and lecturing on the customs of his country and the habits of  its people. Our mutual interests caused our friendship to ripen fast and  when the time of parting came, when each of us had finished our work in  Massachusetts, he going back to his home in New York City and I  returning to Richmond, he asked me to correspond with him. I promised to  do so and our friendship after a year's correspondence became love and  he proposed and I accepted him. We were married in Raleigh by Rev. J. J.  Worlds, pastor of the First Baptist Church, colored.    P. T. Barnum had captured my husband when he was a boy and brought him  to America from Abyssinia, educated him and then sent him back to his  native country. He would not stay and soon he was in America again. He  was of the Catholic faith in America and they conferred the honor of  priesthood upon him but after he married me this priesthood was taken  away and he joined the Episcopal Church. After we were married we  decided to go on an extensive lecture tour. He had been a headsman in  his own country and a prince. We took the customs of his people and his  experiences as the subject of our lectures. I could sing, play the  guitar, violin and piano, but I did not know his native language. He  began to teach me and as soon as I could sing the song _How Firm A  Foundation_ in his language which went this way:        Ngama i-bata, Njami buyek      Wema Wemeta, Negana i      bukek diol, di Njami,      i-diol de Kak      Annimix, Annimix hanci        Bata ba Satana i-bu butete      Bata ba Npjami i bunanan      Bata be satana ba laba i wa--      Bata ba Njami ba laba Munonga    We traveled and lectured in both the north and the south and our life,  while we had to work hard, was one of happiness and contentment. I  traveled and lectured as the Princess Quango Hennadonah Perceriah, wife  of the Abyssinian Prince. I often recited the recitation written by the  colored poet, Paul Lawrence Dunbar _When Malinda Sings_ to the delight of  our audiences.           *       *       *       *       *    The following incidents of African life were related to me by my husband  Quango Hennadonah Perceriah and they were also given in his lectures on  African customs while touring the United States.    The religion of the Bakuba tribe of Abyssinia was almost wholly Pagan  as the natives believed fully in witchcraft, sorcery, myths and  superstitions. The witch doctor held absolute sway over the members of  the tribe and when his reputation as a giver of rain, bountiful crops or  success in the chase was at stake the tribes were called together and  those accused by the witch doctor of being responsible for these  conditions through witchery were condemned and speedily executed.    The people were called together by the beating of drums. The witch  doctor, dressed in the most hellish garb imaginable with his body  painted and poisonous snake bone necklaces dangling from his neck and  the claws of ferocious beasts, lions, leopards and the teeth of vicious  man-eating crocodiles finishing up his adornment, sat in the middle of  a court surrounded by the members of the tribe. In his hand he carried a  gourd which contained beads, shot, or small stones. He began his  incantations by rattling the contents of the gourd, shouting and making  many weird wails and peculiar contortions. After this had gone on for  sometime until he was near exhaustion his face assumed the expression of  one in great pain and this was the beginning of the end for some poor  ignorant savage. He squirmed and turned in different directions with his  eyes fixed with a set stare as if in expectancy when suddenly his gaze  would be fixed on some member of the tribe and his finger pointed  directly at him. The victim was at once seized and bound, the doctor's  gaze never leaving him until this was done. If one victim appeased his  nervous fervor the trial was over but if his wrought-up feelings desired  more his screechings continued until a second victim was secured. He had  these men put to death to justify himself in the eyes of the natives of  his tribe for his failing to bring rain, bountiful crops and success to  the tribe.    The witch doctor who sat as judge seemed to have perfect control over  the savages minds and no one questioned his decisions. The persons were  reconciled to their fate and were led away to execution while they  moaned and bade their friends goodbye in the doleful savage style.  Sometimes they were put on a boat, taken out into the middle of a river  and there cut to pieces with blades of grass, their limbs being  dismembered first and thrown into the river to the crocodiles. A drink  containing an opiate was generally given the victim to deaden the pain  but often this formality was dispensed with. The victims were often cut  to pieces at the place of trial with knives and their limbs thrown out  to the vultures that almost continuously hover 'round the huts and  kraals of the savage tribes of Africa.    In some instances condemned persons were burned at the stake. This form  of execution is meted out at some of the religious dances or festivities  to some of their pagan gods to atone and drive away the evil spirits  that have caused pestilences to come upon the people. The victims at  these times are tortured in truly savage fashion, being burned to death  by degrees while the other members of the tribe dance around and go wild  with religious fervor calling to their gods while the victim screeches  with pain in his slowly approaching death throes. Young girls, women,  boys and men are often accused of witchcraft. One method they used of  telling whether the victim accused was innocent or guilty was to give  them a liquid poison made from the juice of several poisonous plants. If  they could drink it and live they were innocent, if they died they were  guilty. In most cases death was almost instantaneous. Some vomited the  poison from their stomachs and lived.    The Bakubas sometimes resorted to cannibalism and my husband told me  of a Bakuba girl who ate her own mother.

Christus imperat.         Christus rex superat. Christus triumphat.         Maria glorificat. Christus coronat._      [4] Besides some other inscriptions on the spire, you read round    the first gallery of the crown these words:          _Jesus Christus verbum caro factum est,         Jesus Christus, et habitavit in nobis,         Jesus Christus, et vidimus gloriam ejus,         Jesus Christus, gloriam quasi unigeniti a Patre._                                    (S. John. 1. 14.)    [Illustration: The column of angels.]    The nave, decked with a copper roof, abounds no less in  decoration than the front. It has large ogive windows adorned  with _rosaces_; at the place where the buttresses, equally carved  with _rosaces_, join the counterforts or pillars, they have at  their tops fine clochetoons; a great many statues and grotesque  figures of heads complete the ornaments of this part of the  church. Two galleries, one under the windows, the other below the  clochetoons of the counterforts, lead from the towers to the  cross-aisle. This, as we have already said, is still byzantine  in several parts of it. The southern porch, formed by two  semi-circular doors made evidently at one of the remotest periods  of the Cathedral, is adorned with bas-reliefs and statues;  according to tradition, it is reported that two of these statues  are the work of Sabina of Steinbach. One is a woman in a  triumphal posture holding in her hands a communion cup and a  cross; she is the symbol of the church that vanquished the  synagogue; the other, a symbol of the latter, is a woman looking  down, blindfolded and leaning with pain on a broken spear, whilst  the laws of the twelve tables drop from her left hand. On the  parvis before this porch is erected, on the left, the statue of  Sabina herself, and on the right, the statue of Erwin of  Steinbach, both due to the chisel of Mr. Grass.    The wall of the upper tier has openings for several windows of  an ogive form, above which a gallery runs all along; two  round-windows take up the third tier. The northern portion of the  cross-aisle has more generally preserved the byzantine manner  than that we have just spoken of; however, this intermixture with  the gothic style denounces latter renovations. The ancient porch,  the remains of very old constructions, is masked by a fore-front  that belongs to the last period of the gothic art, and which was  built in 1494 by James of Landshut; this new porch (_porch of St.  Laurence_), though handsome in its _ensemble_, is wanting in that  noble simplicity and purity of taste that distinguishes the other  parts of the Cathedral; it is overloaded with ornaments, and its  statues have a stiffness that is found nowhere else.    The octangular dome over the chancel is also of the byzantine  era; however, it has been renewed in several parts. In the place  of the deformed cupola, destroyed by the fire of 1870, a handsome  pyramid has been erected in the year 1878, after the plans of Mr.  Klotz, architect of the Cathedral.    Up to 1772 the lower part of the lateral fronts of the church was  disfigured by paltry decayed houses; the same year they were  pulled down and in their places the present porticos were built,  which are not wanting in elegance: the shops and stalls that  formerly obstructed in so disgraceful a manner the access to the  nave, have also disappeared; and the porches have been repaired  with a great amount of good taste.    The view of the _interior_ of the nave leaves a deep impression.  It is mysteriously lighted by magnificent painted windows, and  supported on each side by seven large pillars, composed of round  agglomerated columns. The two first of these pillars, more  gigantic than the rest, support also the towers; the total  elevation of the upper arch is more than 31 metres. The interior  front, over the principal porch, is adorned with a beautiful  sculptured round-window; between this and the grand rose-window  is a glass gallery. Above the arches that unite the pillars on  both sides of the nave and all along is a fine gothic gallery,  serving as a basis to large windows, similar to those of the  lower sides of the church. The lower part of the wall of the  latter is ornamented with a range of small columns, joined  together by og-arches. The magnificent windows of this church  represent subjects and personages of Scripture and Legend. Among  the artists who have painted these windows, the oldest one known,  is master John of Kirchheim; those made after his drawings were  put up in 1348; there is no doubt that many of his works still  adorn the Cathedral. The names of John Markgraf, James Vischer  and the brothers Link were mentioned later. At the latter part of  the eighteenth century John Daniel Danegger painted also some,  which, however, owing to their mediocrity, have since been  removed. For some years past they have undergone considerable  repair under the direction of artists of talent and well  acquainted with the science of antiquities. The painted windows  of the upper galleries of the nave represent the seventy four  ancestors of Jesus Christ; higher up are the images of saints and  martyrs; in the right aisle, over the vestry, is seen the  gigantic figure of saint Christopher: on the South side, of the  six windows that have each sixteen divisions, the four first  contain some scenes from the history of the Bible; the two last,  the day of Judgment and the celestial Jerusalem. On the North  side, in an equal number of windows, you see the birth of Jesus  Christ, the wise men, and the portraits of several German  emperors; the last of these windows represents a series of the  oldest events in Scripture. The effect produced by these  beautiful windows is greatly increased since they had the happy  idea to wash away the daubing with which, about thirty years ago,  they had besmeared the inner walls of the Cathedral; by these  means the bare part of the wall, a fine stone of a rosy tint,  which served for the construction of the church, is rendered  visible; it was a measure that bespoke much good taste and  knowledge of the christian art.    On the left side of the nave is fixed the organ which extends up  to the superior arch. It is a master-piece of work of Andrew  Silbermann, who was one of the most able organ-builders of his  time and who built it in 1704. Pierced by a shell during the  bombardment of 1870, this organ of Silbermann has been restored  by a distinguished organ builder of our city.    On the same side, at the fifth pillar, stands the pulpit, erected  in 1486 by John Hammerer, by order of the magistrate, for the  celebrated preacher Geiler of Kaysersberg. This work of  sculpture, remarkably delicate, is adorned with nearly fifty  little statues, the meaning of which is easy to understand. The  canopy is of a modern style, and was made in 1824 to replace a  more ancient one, perhaps the first erected in 1617, which has  been handed down to us as a most simple piece of workmanship, and  made of lime-wood. At the foot of the stairs are two figures, a  man in the posture of rest and a woman praying; we may justly  suppose that they are meant for the maker of the pulpit and his  wife.    [Illustration]    The chancel is joined to the nave by two pillars of very large  dimensions and whose tops belong to one of the constructions  anterior to the gothic order. The magnificent lobby built by  Erwin of Steinbach was taken down to make room for the taste  prevailing in the seventeenth century; it was demolished in 1682.  Two high and circular columns support the cupola of the chancel  and separate it from its two aisles; in the centre of each of the  latter stand also columns to sustain the arch-roofs; that of the  northern part is round, whilst the column of the southern aisle  is composed of a collection of very slender pillars, probably of  a later construction; this long, thin and gracious column bears  in its corners some statues, the fineness and gracefulness of  which recall to mind the work of Sabina of Steinbach. Beneath are  the four Evangelists; above four angels holding trumpets, and  uppermost the Saviour and three angels with the implements of the  Saviour's passion in their hands; it is called the angel's column  or Erwin's column. On the large pillar which unites the nave to  the chancel, are two inscriptions in commemoration of the famous  preacher Geiler of Kaysersberg who, for many years, displayed his  eloquence from the pulpit of the Cathedral. In this same aisle is  erected the statue of bishop Wernher, meditating the design of  the church laid before him. Opposite this statue, the work of Mr.  Friderich, is the celebrated.      Astronomical Clock.    As early as 1352 an astronomical clock was begun under bishop  Berthold of Bucheck, and finished two years after by an unknown  artist, in the time of John of Lichtenberg. It was fixed to the  wall facing the present one. The frame-work of that first clock  was all of wood; the stones that formed its basis are to this day  seen projecting from the wall. It was divided into three parts;  the lower part contained a universal calendar; in the middle was  an astrolabe, and in the superior division were seen the three  wise men and the Virgin Mary carved in wood; the wise men bent  every hour before the Virgin, by means of a peculiar mechanism,  which at the same time put in motion a chime of harmonious sounds  and a cock crowing and flapping his wings.    The exact time at which this clock, which in the fourteenth  century must have been a wonderful piece of workmanship, and was  called the clock of the three sages, ceased going, is not known:  it had been stopped for a long time, when in 1547 the magistrate  of the town decided on having another made and putting it  opposite the old one, in the very place the clock now occupies.  Three distinguished mathematicians furnished the plan and  superintended "]]]
