But, as Professor Thiele goes on to say--         \"If the law of causality is acknowledged to be an assumption       which always holds good, then every observation gives us a       revelation which, when correctly appraised and compared with       others, teaches us the laws by which God rules the world.\"    By what means have the modern scientists arrived at a position so  different from that of the heathen? It cannot have been by any process  of natural evolution that the intellectual standpoint which has made  scientific observation possible should be derived from the spiritual  standpoint of polytheism which rendered all scientific observation not  only profane but useless.    In the old days the heathen in general regarded the heavenly host and  the heavenly bodies as the heathen do to-day. But by one nation, the  Hebrews, the truth that--         \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\"    was preserved in the first words of their Sacred Book. That nation  declared--         \"All the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord made the       heavens.\"    For that same nation the watchword was--         \"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord.\"    From these words the Hebrews not only learned a great spiritual truth,  but derived intellectual freedom. For by these words they were taught  that all the host of heaven and of earth were created things--merely  \"things,\" not divinities--and not only that, but that the Creator was  One God, not many gods; that there was but one law-giver; and that  therefore there could be no conflict of laws. These first words of  Genesis, then, may be called the charter of all the physical sciences,  for by them is conferred freedom from all the bonds of unscientific  superstition, and by them also do men know that consistent law holds  throughout the whole universe. It is the intellectual freedom of the  Hebrew that the scientist of to-day inherits. He may not indeed be able  to rise to the spiritual standpoint of the Hebrew, and consciously  acknowledge that--         \"Thou, even Thou, art Lord alone; Thou hast made heaven, the       heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all       things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,       and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven       worshippeth Thee.\"    But he must at least unconsciously assent to it, for it is on the first  great fundamental assumption of religion as stated in the first words of  Genesis, that the fundamental assumption of all his scientific reasoning  depends.    Scientific reasoning and scientific observation can only hold good so  long and in so far as the Law of Causality holds good. We must assume a  pre-existing state of affairs which has given rise to the observed  effect; we must assume that this observed effect is itself antecedent to  a subsequent state of affairs. Science therefore cannot go back to the  absolute beginnings of things, or forward to the absolute ends of  things. It cannot reason about the way matter and energy came into  existence, or how they might cease to exist; it cannot reason about time  or space, as such, but only in the relations of these to phenomena that  can be observed. It does not deal with things themselves, but only with  the relations between things. Science indeed can only consider the  universe as a great machine which is in \"going order,\" and it concerns  itself with the relations which some parts of the machine bear to other  parts, and with the laws and manner of the \"going\" of the machine in  those parts. The relations of the various parts, one to the other, and  the way in which they work together, may afford some idea of the design  and purpose of the machine, but it can give no information as to how the  material of which it is composed came into existence, nor as to the  method by which it was originally constructed. Once started, the  machine comes under the scrutiny of science, but the actual starting  lies outside its scope.    Men therefore cannot find out for themselves how the worlds were  originally made, how the worlds were first moved, or how the spirit of  man was first formed within him; and this, not merely because these  beginnings of things were of necessity outside his experience, but also  because beginnings, as such, must lie outside the law by which he  reasons.    By no process of research, therefore, could man find out for himself the  facts that are stated in the first chapter of Genesis. They must have  been revealed. Science cannot inquire into them for the purpose of  checking their accuracy; it must accept them, as it accepts the  fundamental law that governs its own working, without the possibility of  proof.    And this is what has been revealed to man:--that the heaven and the  earth were not self-existent from all eternity, but were in their first  beginning created by God. As the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews  expresses it: \"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed  by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of  things which do appear.\" And a further fact was revealed that man could  not have found out for himself; viz. that this creation was made and  finished in six Divine actings, comprised in what the narrative  denominates \"days.\" It has not been revealed whether the duration of  these \"days\" can be expressed in any astronomical units of time.    Since under these conditions science can afford no information, it is  not to be wondered at that the hypotheses that have been framed from  time to time to \"explain\" the first chapter of Genesis, or to express it  in scientific terms, are not wholly satisfactory. At one time the  chapter was interpreted to mean that the entire universe was called into  existence about 6,000 years ago, in six days of twenty-four hours each.  Later it was recognized that both geology and astronomy seemed to  indicate the existence of matter for untold millions of years instead of  some six thousand. It was then pointed out that, so far as the narrative  was concerned, there might have been a period of almost unlimited  duration between its first verse and its fourth; and it was suggested  that the six days of creation were six days of twenty-four hours each,  in which, after some great cataclysm, 6,000 years ago, the face of the  earth was renewed and replenished for the habitation of man, the  preceding geological ages being left entirely unnoticed. Some writers  have confined the cataclysm and renewal to a small portion of the  earth's surface--to \"Eden,\" and its neighbourhood. Other commentators  have laid stress on the truth revealed in Scripture that \"one day is  with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day,\" and  have urged the argument that the six days of creation were really vast  periods of time, during which the earth's geological changes and the  evolution of its varied forms of life were running their course. Others,  again, have urged that the six days of creation were six literal days,  but instead of being consecutive were separated by long ages. And yet  again, as no man was present during the creation period, it has been  suggested that the Divine revelation of it was given to Moses or some  other inspired prophet in six successive visions or dreams, which  constituted the \"six days\" in which the chief facts of creation were set  forth.    All such hypotheses are based on the assumption that the opening  chapters of Genesis are intended to reveal to man certain physical  details in the material history of this planet; to be in fact a little  compendium of the geological and zoological history of the world, and so  a suitable introduction to the history of the early days of mankind  which followed it.    It is surely more reasonable to conclude that there was no purpose  whatever of teaching us anything about the physical relationships of  land and sea, of tree and plant, of bird and fish; it seems, indeed,  scarcely conceivable that it should have been the Divine intention so to  supply the ages with a condensed manual of the physical sciences. What  useful purpose could it have served? What man would have been the wiser  or better for it? Who could have understood it until the time when men,  by their own intellectual strivings, had attained sufficient knowledge  of their physical surroundings to do without such a revelation at all?    But although the opening chapters of Genesis were not designed to teach  the Hebrew certain physical facts of nature, they gave him the knowledge  that he might lawfully study nature. For he learnt from them that nature  has no power nor vitality of its own; that sun, and sea, and cloud, and  wind are not separate deities, nor the expression of deities that they  are but \"things,\" however glorious and admirable; that they are the  handiwork of God; and--         \"The works of the Lord are great,          Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.        His work is honour and majesty;          And His righteousness endureth for ever.        He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered.\"    What, then, is the significance of the detailed account given us of the  works effected on the successive days of creation? Why are we told that  light was made on the first day, the firmament on the second, dry land  on the third, and so on? Probably for two reasons.

He was the most hungry and       rapacious of all book and print collectors; and, in his       ravages, spared neither the most delicate nor costly       specimens. His eyes and his mouth seem to have been always       open to express his astonishment at, sometimes, the most       common and contemptible productions; and his paper in the       Philosophical Transactions betrays such simplicity and       ignorance that one is astonished how my Lord Oxford and the       learned Bishop of Ely could have employed so credulous a       bibliographical forager. A modern collector and lover of       _perfect_ copies will witness, with shuddering, among       Bagford's immense collection of Title Pages, in the Museum,       the frontispieces of the Complutensian Polyglot, and       Chauncy's History of Hertfordshire, torn out to illustrate a       History of Printing. His enthusiasm, however, carried him       through a great deal of laborious toil; and he supplied, in       some measure, by this qualification, the want of other       attainments. His whole mind was devoted to book-hunting; and       his integrity and diligence probably made his employers       overlook his many failings. His hand-writing is scarcely       legible, and his orthography is still more wretched; but if       he was ignorant, he was humble, zealous, and grateful; and       he has certainly done something towards the accomplishment       of that desirable object, an accurate General History of       Printing. In my edition of _Ames's Typographical       Antiquities_, I shall give an analysis of Bagford's papers,       with a specimen or two of his composition.]         [Footnote 16: For an eloquent account of this disorder       consult the letters of Dr. Mosely inserted in the Morning       Herald of last year. I have always been surprised, and a       little vexed, that these animated pieces of composition       should be relished and praised by every one--but _the       Faculty_!]    Let us enquire, therefore, into the origin and tendency of the  BIBLIOMANIA.    In this enquiry I purpose considering the subject under three points  of view: I. THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE; or an account of the eminent  men who have fallen victims to it: II. THE NATURE, OR SYMPTOMS OF THE  DISEASE: and III. THE PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE. We are to consider,  then,    1. THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE. In treating of the history of this  disease, it will be found to have been attended with this remarkable  circumstance; namely, that it has almost uniformly confined its  attacks to the _male_ sex, and, among these, to people in the higher  and middling classes of society, while the artificer, labourer, and  peasant have escaped wholly uninjured. It has raged chiefly in  palaces, castles, halls, and gay mansions; and those things which in  general are supposed not to be inimical to health, such as  cleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour, are only so many inducements  towards the introduction and propagation of the BIBLIOMANIA! What  renders it particularly formidable is that it rages in all seasons of  the year, and at all periods of human existence. The emotions of  friendship or of love are weakened or subdued as old age advances; but  the influence of this passion, or rather disease, admits of no  mitigation: \"it grows with our growth, and strengthens with our  strength;\" and is oft-times         ----The ruling passion strong in death.[17]         [Footnote 17: The writings of the Roman philologers seem to       bear evidence of this fact. Seneca, when an old man, says       that, \"if you are fond of books, you will escape the ennui       of life; you will neither sigh for evening, disgusted with       the occupations of the day--nor will you live dissatisfied       with yourself, or unprofitable to others.\" _De       Tranquilitate_, ch. 3. Cicero has positively told us that       \"study is the food of youth, and the amusement of old age.\"       _Orat. pro Archia_. The younger Pliny was a downright       Bibliomaniac. \"I am quite transported and comforted,\" says       he, \"in the midst of my books: they give a zest to the       happiest, and assuage the anguish of the bitterest, moments       of existence! Therefore, whether distracted by the cares or       the losses of my family, or my friends, I fly to my library       as the only refuge in distress: here I learn to bear       adversity with fortitude.\" _Epist._ lib. viii. cap. 19. But       consult Cicero _De Senectute_. All these treatises afford       abundant proof of the hopelessness of cure in cases of the       Bibliomania.]    We will now, my dear Sir, begin \"making out the catalogue\" of victims  to the BIBLIOMANIA! The first eminent character who appears to have  been infected with this disease was RICHARD DE BURY, one of the tutors  of Edward III., and afterwards Bishop of Durham; a man who has been  uniformly praised for the variety of his erudition, and the  intenseness of his ardour in book-collecting.[18] I discover no other  notorious example of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA until the time of  Henry VII.; when the monarch himself may be considered as having added  to the number. Although our venerable typographer, Caxton, lauds and  magnifies, with equal sincerity, the whole line of British Kings, from  Edward IV. to Henry VII. [under whose patronage he would seem, in some  measure, to have carried on his printing business], yet, of all these  monarchs, the latter alone was so unfortunate as to fall a victim to  this disease. His library must have been a magnificent one, if we may  judge from the splendid specimens of it which now remain.[19] It would  appear, too, that, about this time, the BIBLIOMANIA was increased by  the introduction of foreign printed books; and it is not very  improbable that a portion of Henry's immense wealth was devoted  towards the purchase of VELLUM copies, which were now beginning to be  published by the great typographical triumvirate, Verard, Eustace, and  Pigouchet.         [Footnote 18: It may be expected that I should notice a few       book-lovers, and probably BIBLIOMANIACS, previously to the       time of Richard De Bury; but so little is known with       accuracy of Johannes Scotus Erigena, and his patron Charles       the Bald, King of France, or of the book tete-a-tetes they       used to have together--so little, also, of Nennius, Bede,       and Alfred [although the monasteries at this period, from       the evidence of Sir William Dugdale, in the first volume of       the Monasticon were \"opulently endowed,\"--inter alia, I       should hope, with magnificent MSS. on vellum, bound in       velvet, and embossed with gold and silver], or the       illustrious writers in the Norman period, and the fine books       which were in the abbey of Croyland--so little is known of       book-collectors, previously to the 14th century, that I       thought it the most prudent and safe way to begin with the       above excellent prelate.         RICHARD DE BURY was the friend and correspondent of       Petrarch; and is said by Mons. de Sade, in his Memoires pour       la vie de Petrarque, \"to have done in England what Petrarch       did all his life in France, Italy, and Germany, towards the       discovery of MSS. of the best ancient writers, and making       copies of them under his own superintendence.\" His passion       for book-collecting was unbounded [\"vir ardentis ingenii,\"       says Petrarch of him]; and in order to excite the same       ardour in his countrymen, or rather to propagate the disease       of the BIBLIOMANIA with all his might, he composed a       bibliographical work under the title of _Philobiblion_;       concerning the first edition of which, printed at Spires in       1483, Clement (tom. v. 142) has a long gossiping account;       and Morhof tells us that it is \"rarissima et in paucorum       manibus versatur.\" It was reprinted in Paris in 1500, 4to.,       by the elder Ascensius, and frequently in the subsequent       century, but the best editions of it are those by Goldastus       in 1674, 8vo., and Hummius in 1703. Morhof observes that,       \"however De Bury's work savours of the rudeness of the age,       it is rather elegantly written, and many things are well       said in it relating to Bibliothecism.\" _Polyhist. Literar._       vol. i. 187, edit. 1747.         For further particulars concerning De Bury, read Bale,       Wharton, Cave, and Godwin's Episcopal Biography. He left       behind him a fine library of MSS. which he bequeathed to       Durham, now Trinity, College, Oxford.         It may be worth the antiquary's notice, that, in consequence       (I suppose) of this amiable prelate's exertions, \"in every       convent was a noble library and a great: and every friar,       that had state in school, such as they be now, hath AN HUGH       LIBRARY.\" See the curious Sermon of the Archbishop of       Armagh, Nov. 8, 1387, in Trevisa's works among the _Harleian       MSS._ No. 1900. Whether these Friars, thus affected with       the frensy of book-collecting, ever visited the \"old       chapelle at the Est End of the church of S. Saink       [Berkshire], whither of late time resorted in pilgrimage       many folkes for the disease of _madness_,\" [see Leland's       _Itinerary_, vol. ii. 29, edit. 1770] I have not been able,       after the most diligent investigation, to ascertain.]         [Footnote 19: The British Museum contains a great number of       books which bear the royal stamp of Henry VII.'s arms. Some       of these printed by Verard, UPON VELLUM, are magnificent       memorials of a library, the dispersion of which is for ever       to be"]]]
