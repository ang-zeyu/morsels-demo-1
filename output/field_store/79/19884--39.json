This little instrument, which magnified only three times, he  carried in triumph to Venice, where it excited the most intense  interest. Crowds of the principal citizens flocked to his house to see  the magical toy; and after nearly a month had been spent in gratifying  this epidemical curiosity, Galileo was led to understand from Leonardo  Deodati, the Doge of Venice, that the senate would be highly gratified  by obtaining possession of so extraordinary an instrument. Galileo  instantly complied with the wishes of his patrons, who acknowledged the  present by a mandate conferring upon him for life his professorship at  Padua, and generously raising his salary from 520 to 1000 florins.[9]         [8] On the First Invention of Telescopes.--_Journ. R. Instit._,       1831., vol i., p. 496.         [9] Viviani _Vita del' Galileo_, p. 69.    Although we cannot doubt the veracity of Galileo, when he affirms that  he had never seen any of the Dutch telescopes, yet it is expressly  stated by Fuccarius, that one of these instruments had at this time been  brought to Florence; and Sirturus assures us that a Frenchman, calling  himself a partner of the Dutch inventor, came to Milan in May 1609, and  offered a telescope to the Count de Fuentes. In a letter from Lorenzo  Pignoria to Paolo Gualdo, dated from Padua, on the 31st of August 1609,  it is expressly said, that, at the re-election of the professors,  Galileo had contrived to obtain 1000 florins for life, which was alleged  to be on account of an eye-glass like the one which was sent from  Flanders to the Cardinal Borghese.    In a memoir so brief and general as the present, it would be out of  place to discuss the history of this extraordinary invention. We have no  hesitation in asserting that a method of magnifying distant objects was  known to Baptista Porta and others; but it seems to be equally certain  that an _instrument_ for producing these effects was first constructed  in Holland, and that it was from that kingdom that Galileo derived the  knowledge of its existence. In considering the contending claims, which  have been urged with all the ardour and partiality of national feeling,  it has been generally overlooked, _that a single convex lens_, whose  focal length exceeds the distance at which we examine minute objects,  performs the part of a telescope, when an eye, placed behind it, sees  distinctly the inverted image which it forms. A lens, twenty feet in  focal length, will in this manner magnify twenty times; and it was by  the same principle that Sir William Herschel discovered a new satellite  of Saturn, by using only the mirror of his forty-feet telescope. The  instrument presented to Prince Maurice, and which the Marquis Spinola  found in the shop of John Lippershey, the spectacle maker of Middleburg,  must have been an astronomical telescope consisting of two convex  lenses. Upon this supposition, it differed from that which Galileo  constructed; and the Italian philosopher will be justly entitled to the  honour of having invented that form of the telescope which still bears  his name, while we must accord to the Dutch optician the honour of  having previously invented the astronomical telescope.    The interest which the exhibition of the telescope excited at Venice did  not soon subside: Sirturi[10] describes it as amounting almost to  phrensy. When he himself had succeeded in making one of these  instruments, he ascended the tower of St Mark, where he might use it  without molestation. He was recognised, however, by a crowd in the  street; and such was the eagerness of their curiosity, that they took  possession of the wondrous tube, and detained the impatient philosopher  for several hours, till they had successively witnessed its effects.  Desirous of obtaining the same gratification for their friends, they  endeavoured to learn the name of the inn at which he lodged; but Sirturi  fortunately overheard their inquiries, and quitted Venice early next  morning, in order to avoid a second visitation of this new school of  philosophers. The opticians speedily availed themselves of the new  instrument. Galileo's tube,--or the double eye-glass, or the cylinder,  or the trunk, as it was then called, for Demisiano had not yet given it  the appellation of _telescope_,--was manufactured in great quantities,  and in a very superior manner. The instruments were purchased merely as  philosophical toys, and were carried by travellers into every corner of  Europe.         [10] De Telescopio.    The art of grinding and polishing lenses was at this time very  imperfect. Galileo, and those whom he instructed, were alone capable of  making tolerable instruments. It appears, from the testimony of Gassendi  and Gaertner, that, in 1634, a good telescope could not be procured in  Paris, Venice, or Amsterdam; and that, even in 1637, there was not one  in Holland which could shew Jupiter's disc well defined.    After Galileo had completed his first instrument, which magnified only  _three_ times, he executed a larger and a better one, with a power of  about _eight_. \"At length,\" as he himself remarks, \"sparing neither  labour nor expense,\" he constructed an instrument so excellent, that it  bore a magnifying power of more than _thirty_ times.    The first celestial object to which Galileo applied his telescope was  the moon, which, to use his own words, appeared as near as if it had  been distant only two semidiameters of the earth. He then directed it to  the planets and the fixed stars, which he frequently observed with  \"incredible delight.\"[11]         [11] Incredibili animi jucunditate.    The observations which he made upon the moon possessed a high degree of  interest. The general resemblance of its surface to that of our own  globe naturally fixed his attention; and he was soon able to trace, in  almost every part of the lunar disc, ranges of mountains, deep hollows,  and other inequalities, which reverberated from their summits and  margins the rays of the rising sun, while the intervening hollows were  still buried in darkness. The dark and luminous spaces he regarded as  indicating seas and continents, which reflected, in different degrees,  the incidental light of the sun; and he ascribed the phosphorescence, as  it has been improperly called, or the secondary light, which is seen on  the dark limb of the moon in her first and last quarters, to the  reflection of the sun's light from the earth.    These discoveries were ill received by the followers of Aristotle.  According to their preconceived opinions, the moon was perfectly  spherical, and absolutely smooth; and to cover it with mountains, and  scoop it out into valleys, was an act of impiety which defaced the  regular forms which Nature herself had imprinted. It was in vain that  Galileo appealed to the evidence of observation, and to the actual  surface of our own globe. The very irregularities on the moon were, in  his opinion, the proof of divine wisdom; and had its surface been  absolutely smooth, it would have been \"but a vast unblessed desert, void  of animals, of plants, of cities, and of men--the abode of silence and  inaction--senseless, lifeless, soulless, and stripped of all those  ornaments which now render it so varied and so beautiful.\"    In examining the fixed stars, and comparing them with the planets,  Galileo observed a remarkable difference in the appearance of their  discs. All the planets appeared with round globular discs like the moon;  whereas the fixed stars never exhibited any disc at all, but resembled  lucid points sending forth twinkling rays. Stars of all magnitudes he  found to have the same appearance; those of the fifth and sixth  magnitude having the same character, when seen through a telescope, as  Sirius, the largest of the stars, when seen by the naked eye. Upon  directing his telescope to nebulae and clusters of stars, he was  delighted to find that they consisted of great numbers of stars which  could not be recognised by unassisted vision. He counted no fewer than  _forty_ in the cluster called the _Pleiades_, or _Seven Stars_; and he  has given us drawings of this constellation, as well as of the belt and  sword of Orion, and of the nebula of Praesepe. In the great nebula of the  Milky Way, he descried crowds of minute stars; and he concluded that  this singular portion of the heavens derived its whiteness from still  smaller stars, which his telescope was unable to separate.    Important and interesting as these discoveries were, they were thrown  into the shade by those to which he was led during an accurate  examination of the planets with a more powerful telescope. On the 7th of  January 1610, at one o'clock in the morning, when he directed his  telescope to Jupiter, he observed three stars near the body of the  planet, two being to the east and one to the west of him. They were all  in a straight line, and parallel to the ecliptic, and appeared brighter  than other stars of the same magnitude. Believing them to be fixed  stars, he paid no great attention to their distances from Jupiter and  from one another. On the 8th of January, however, when, from some cause  or other,[12] he had been led to observe the stars again, he found a  very different arrangement of them: all the three were on the west side  of Jupiter, _nearer one another than before_, and almost at equal  distances. Though he had not turned his attention to the extraordinary  fact of the mutual approach of the stars, yet he began to consider how  Jupiter could be found to the east of the three stars, when but the day  before he had been to the west of two of them. The only explanation  which he could give of this fact was, that the motion of Jupiter was  _direct_, contrary to astronomical calculations, and that he had got  before these two stars by his own motion.
