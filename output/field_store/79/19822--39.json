Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in  the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something  was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare  of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and  having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber,  Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no robbery, nor is there any  evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in  the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to  how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.  If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find  me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.  If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would  esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.  Yours faithfully,    \"TOBIAS GREGSON.\"      \"Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" my friend remarked;  \"he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and  energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives  into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional  beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put  upon the scent.\"    I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \"Surely there is  not a moment to be lost,\" I cried, \"shall I go and order you a cab?\"    \"I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy  devil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me,  for I can be spry enough at times.\"    \"Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\"    \"My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the  whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will  pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\"    \"But he begs you to help him.\"    \"Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but  he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.  However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my  own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\"    He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that  an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.    \"Get your hat,\" he said.    \"You wish me to come?\"    \"Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\" A minute later we were both in  a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.    It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the  house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets  beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away  about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and  an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the  melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.    \"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\" I said at  last, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.    \"No data yet,\" he answered. \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before  you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\"    \"You will have your data soon,\" I remarked, pointing with my finger;  \"this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much  mistaken.\"    \"So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\" We were still a hundred yards or so from  it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon  foot.    Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was  one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being  occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant  melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and  there a \"To Let\" card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared  panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly  plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed  by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a  mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the  rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a  three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and  against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by  a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes  in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.    I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the  house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be  further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the  circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up  and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the  opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,  he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass  which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice  he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation  of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey  soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was  unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.  Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his  perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal  which was hidden from me.    At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,  flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and  wrung my companion's hand with effusion. \"It is indeed kind of you to  come,\" he said, \"I have had everything left untouched.\"    \"Except that!\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \"If a herd  of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No  doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you  permitted this.\"    \"I have had so much to do inside the house,\" the detective said  evasively. \"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him  to look after this.\"    Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \"With two  such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be  much for a third party to find out,\" he said.    Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \"I think we have done  all that can be done,\" he answered; \"it's a queer case though, and I  knew your taste for such things.\"    \"You did not come here in a cab?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.    \"No, sir.\"    \"Nor Lestrade?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"Then let us go and look at the room.\" With which inconsequent remark he  strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed  his astonishment.    A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.  Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these  had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the  dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had  occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling  at my heart which the presence of death inspires.    It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence  of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was  blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had  become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.  Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of  imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a  red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was  hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was  intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.    All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was  centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon  the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured  ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of  age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and  a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat  and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar  and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor  beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while  his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a  grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,  and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human  features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low  forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly  simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,  unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has  it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy  apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban  London.    Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and  greeted my companion and myself.    \"This case will make a stir, sir,\" he remarked. \"It beats anything I  have seen, and I am no chicken.\"    \"There is no clue?\" said Gregson.    \"None at all,\" chimed in Lestrade.    Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it  intently. \"You are sure that there is no wound?\" he asked, pointing to  numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.    \"Positive!\" cried both detectives.    \"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]  presumably the murderer, if murder has been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24407"],[0,"The Italian Cook Book (#5)"],[1,"grated cheese and some bread crumbs. Repeat the same  operation three or four times, according to the quantity, and finally  season with olive oil, salt and pepper and small pieces of butter. Put  the pan over the fire and when it has begun to boil pour a small cup of  brown stock or broth and a little lemon juice. Remove the same from the  fire and pour it on the chicken breast that have been browned as  described above.      46    WILD DUCK    (Anitra selvatica)    Clean the duck, putting aside the giblets, and cut off the head and  legs. Chop fine a thick slice of ham with both lean and fat together,  with a moderate amount of celery, parsley, carrot and half medium sized  onion. Put the chopped ham and vegetables in a saucepan and lay the duck  on the whole, seasoning with salt and pepper. Brown on all sides and add  water to complete the cooking.    Cabbage or lentils, cooked in water and afterward allowed to complete  the cooking in the sauce obtained from the duck, form a good addition.    To remove the \"gamey\" taste from the wild duck, either wash it in  vinegar before cooking or scald it in boiling water.      47    STEWED SQUABS    (Piccioni in umido)    Garnish the squabs with whole sage leaves and place them in a saucepan  over a bed of small slices of ham containing both lean and fat, season  with salt, pepper and olive oil. Place on the fire and when they begin  to be browned, add a piece of butter and complete the cooking by pouring  in some good broth. Before removing from the fire squeeze one lemon over  them and garnish with squares or diamonds of toasted bread. Take care  not to add too much salt on account of the ham and the broth both  containing salt.    =Note=--Many of these dishes, it will be noticed, are made with broth.  When meat broth is not available, it can be prepared with bouillon cubes  or with Liebig or Armour Extracts. It is, however, always preferable to  use broth made with fresh meat.      48    RAGOUT OF SQUABS    (Manicaretto di piccione)    Cut two or more squabs at the joints, preferably in four parts each, and  put them on the fire with a slice of ham, a piece of butter, and a bunch  of parsley. When they begin to dry, add some broth and--before they are  completely cooked--their giblets and fresh mushrooms cut in slices.  Continue pouring in broth and allow the whole to simmer on a low fire.  Add another piece of butter over which some flour has been sprinkled, or  flour alone. Before serving, remove the ham and the bunch of greens and  squeeze some lemon juice over the squabs.    Some sweetbread may be added with good effect, but it must be first  scalded and the skin removed.      49    SQUAB TIMBALE    (Timballo di piccioni)    Chop together some ham, onion, celery and carrot, add a piece of butter  and place on the fire with one or two squabs, according to the number of  guests. Add the giblets from the squabs and some more of chicken, if at  hand. Season with salt and pepper, and when the pigeons are browned,  pour over some broth to complete the cooking, taking care, however, that  the sauce does not become too liquid. Remove the latter and place in it  some macaroni that has been half cooked and drained. Keep the macaroni  in the sauce on the fire, stirring them. Make a well reduced Bechamel  sauce, then cut the squabs at the joints, removing the neck, the legs  and the bones of the back, when you would not bone them entirely, which  would be better. Cut the giblets in small pieces and remove the soft  part of the onion.    When the macaroni have absorbed the sauce, season them with grated  cheese, pieces of butter, diamonds or squares of ham, a taste of nutmeg  and some truffles or dry mushrooms previously softened in water. Add  finally the Bechamel sauce and mix the whole.    Take a sufficiently large mold, butter it and line it with soft pastry.  Put everything in the mold, or timbale, cover it with the same pastry  and put in the oven. Take out of the mold and serve hot. Three quarters  of a pound of macaroni and two pigeons are enough for ten persons.      50    SALMI OF GAME    (Uccelli in salmi)    Roast the game completely, seasoning with salt and pepper. If the game  be small birds, leave them whole, if big cut them in four parts. Remove  all the heads and grind them together with some pieces of birds, or some  whole little birds. Put in a saucepan one tablespoonful of butter one  half pound of bacon or ham cut into dice, brown stock or broth, one  tablespoonful each of chopped onion and carrot, one tablespoonful each  of salt, thyme and sage. Allow the sauce to simmer for half an hour  then rub it through a sieve and place in it the roasted game. Make it  boil until the cooking is completed and serve with toasted diamonds of  bread.      51    STEWED HARE    (Stufato di lepre)    Take half of a good sized hare and, after cutting it in pieces, chop  fine one medium sized onion, one clove of garlic, a stalk of celery and  several leaves of rosemary. Put on the fire with some pieces of butter,  two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and four or five strips of bacon or salt  pork, when the whole has been browning for four or five minutes, put the  pieces of hare inside the saucepan and season them with salt, pepper and  spices. When it is browned, put a wineglass of white wine, some fresh  mushrooms, or dry mushrooms previously softened in water. Complete the  cooking with broth and tomato sauce and, if necessary, add another piece  of butter.      52    STEWED RABBIT    (Coniglio in umido)    After washing the rabbit, cut it in rather large pieces and put it on  the fire to drive away the water that is to be drained. When quite dry,  put in the saucepan a piece of butter, a little oil, and a hash  composed of the liver of the rabbit itself, a small piece of corned beef  and some onion, celery, carrot and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.  Stir often and when it is browned add some tomato sauce and another  piece of butter.      53    GREEN SAUCE    (Salsa verde)    Chop all together some capers that have been in vinegar, one anchovy, a  small slice of onion and just a taste of garlic. Crush the resulting  hash with the blade of a knife to make it very fine. Add a sprig of  parsley, chopped together with some leaves of basil and dissolve the  whole in very good olive oil and lemon juice.    This sauce is excellent to season boiled chicken or cold boiled fish or  hard boiled eggs.    Green Peppers can take the place of capers, if these are not at hand.      54    WHITE SAUCE    (Salsa bianca)    This sauce can be served with boiled asparagus or with cauliflower. The  ingredients are 1/4 lb. of butter, a tablespoonful of flour, a  tablespoonful vinegar, one yolk of egg, salt and pepper, broth or water  in sufficient quantity.    Put first on the fire the flour with half the butter and when it begins  to be browned pour over it the broth or the water little by little,  stirring with the wooden spoon and adding the rest of the butter and the  vinegar without making the water boil too much. When taken off the fire  add the yolk of the egg, stir and serve.      55    YELLOW SAUCE    (Salsa gialla)    This sauce is especially good for boiled fish, and the quantities  indicated below are sufficient for a piece of fish or a whole fish  weighing about a pound.    Put on the fire in a little saucepan one teaspoonful of flour and two  ounces of butter, and when the flour begins to be browned, pour over it  little by little one cup of the broth of the fish, that is to say of the  water in which the fish has been boiled. When you see that the flour  does not rise in the boiling water, take away the sauce from the flour  and pour over two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and the yolk of an egg,  stirring and mixing everything well. Squeeze in the sauce half a lemon  and season generously with salt and pepper. Let it cool and then pour  over the fish that is to be served with a sprig of parsley.    This sauce must have the appearance of a cream and must not be too  liquid, in order that it may remain attached to the fish.      56    SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH    (Salsa per pesce in gratella)    This sauce is composed of yolks of eggs, salted anchovies, olive oil and  lemon juice. Boil the eggs in their shell for ten minutes and for every  hard yolk take one large anchovy or two small. Bone the anchovies and  rub them on the sieve together with the hard (or semi-hard) yolks, and  dissolve all with oil and lemon juice to reduce it like a cream. Cover  with this sauce the broiled fish before sending to the table, or serve  aside in a gravy boat.      57    CAPER SAUCE    (Salsa con capperi)    This sauce is especially adapted for boiled fish and the quantities are  for a little more than one pound of fish. The ingredients are two ounces  of butter, two ounces of capers soaked in vinegar one teaspoonful of  flour, salt, pepper and vinegar.    Boil the fish and, when it is left warm in its broth, prepare the sauce.  Put on the fire the flour with half of the butter, mix it and when it  begins to take color, add the remaining butter.    Let boil a little and then pour one half cup of the broth of the fish:  season generously with salt and pepper and take the saucepan from the  fire. Then throw in it the capers, half whole, half chopped, and some  drops of vinegar, but taste it to dose the sauce so that it is pleasant  to the taste and as thick as liquid cream.    It is well to observe here that these sauces in which butter is used  together with acids, such as vinegar, are not for weak stomachs and  should be partaken of sparingly.      58    GENOVESE SAUCE    (Salsa genovese)    Chop fine a sprig of parsley and half a clove of garlic. Then mix with  some capers soaked in vinegar, one anchovy, one hard yolk of egg, three  pitless olives, a crumb of bread as big as an egg, soaked in vinegar.  Grind all these ingredients, rub through a sieve and dissolve in olive  oil, dosing right by "]]]
