[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28693"],[0,"Tales of the Fish Patrol (#5)"],[1," one afternoon, while on patrol work, when all  unknown to us our opportunity happened along. It appeared in the guise  of a helpless yacht loaded with seasick people, so we could hardly be  expected to recognize it as the opportunity. It was a large sloop-yacht,  and it was helpless inasmuch as the trade-wind was blowing half a gale  and there were no capable sailors aboard.    [Illustration: \"He saw fit to laugh sneer at us, before all the  fishermen.\"]    From the wharf at Selby's we watched with careless interest the  lubberly manoeuvre performed of bringing the yacht to anchor, and the  equally lubberly manoeuvre of sending the small boat ashore. A very  miserable-looking man in draggled ducks, after nearly swamping the boat  in the heavy seas, passed us the painter and climbed out. He staggered  about as though the wharf were rolling, and told us his troubles, which  were the troubles of the yacht. The only rough-weather sailor aboard,  the man on whom they all depended, had been called back to San  Francisco by a telegram, and they had attempted to continue the cruise  alone. The high wind and big seas of San Pablo Bay had been too much  for them; all hands were sick, nobody knew anything or could do  anything; and so they had run in to the smelter either to desert the  yacht or to get somebody to bring it to Benicia. In short, did we know  of any sailors who would bring the yacht into Benicia?    Charley looked at me. The _Reindeer_ was lying in a snug place. We had  nothing on hand in the way of patrol work till midnight. With the wind  then blowing, we could sail the yacht into Benicia in a couple of  hours, have several more hours ashore, and come back to the smelter on  the evening train.    \"All right, captain,\" Charley said to the disconsolate yachtsman, who  smiled in sickly fashion at the title.    \"I'm only the owner,\" he explained.    We rowed him aboard in much better style than he had come ashore, and  saw for ourselves the helplessness of the passengers. There were a dozen  men and women, and all of them too sick even to appear grateful at our  coming. The yacht was rolling savagely, broad on, and no sooner had the  owner's feet touched the deck than he collapsed and joined the others.  Not one was able to bear a hand, so Charley and I between us cleared the  badly tangled running gear, got up sail, and hoisted anchor.    It was a rough trip, though a swift one. The Carquinez Straits were a  welter of foam and smother, and we came through them wildly before the  wind, the big mainsail alternately dipping and flinging its boom  skyward as we tore along. But the people did not mind. They did not  mind anything. Two or three, including the owner, sprawled in the  cockpit, shuddering when the yacht lifted and raced and sank dizzily  into the trough, and between-whiles regarding the shore with yearning  eyes. The rest were huddled on the cabin floor among the cushions. Now  and again some one groaned, but for the most part they were as limp as  so many dead persons.    As the bight at Turner's Shipyard opened out, Charley edged into it to  get the smoother water. Benicia was in view, and we were bowling along  over comparatively easy water, when a speck of a boat danced up ahead  of us, directly in our course. It was low-water slack. Charley and I  looked at each other. No word was spoken, but at once the yacht began a  most astonishing performance, veering and yawing as though the greenest  of amateurs was at the wheel. It was a sight for sailormen to see. To  all appearances, a runaway yacht was careering madly over the bight,  and now and again yielding a little bit to control in a desperate  effort to make Benicia.    The owner forgot his seasickness long enough to look anxious. The speck  of a boat grew larger and larger, till we could see Big Alec and his  partner, with a turn of the sturgeon line around a cleat, resting from  their labor to laugh at us. Charley pulled his sou'wester over his eyes,  and I followed his example, though I could not guess the idea he  evidently had in mind and intended to carry into execution.    We came foaming down abreast of the skiff, so close that we could hear  above the wind the voices of Big Alec and his mate as they shouted at  us with all the scorn that professional watermen feel for amateurs,  especially when amateurs are making fools of themselves.    We thundered on past the fishermen, and nothing had happened. Charley  grinned at the disappointment he saw in my face, and then shouted:    \"Stand by the main-sheet to jibe!\"    He put the wheel hard over, and the yacht whirled around obediently.  The main-sheet slacked and dipped, then shot over our heads after the  boom and tautened with a crash on the traveller. The yacht heeled over  almost on her beam ends, and a great wail went up from the seasick  passengers as they swept across the cabin floor in a tangled mass and  piled into a heap in the starboard bunks.    But we had no time for them. The yacht, completing the manoeuvre, headed  into the wind with slatting canvas, and righted to an even keel. We  were still plunging ahead, and directly in our path was the skiff. I  saw Big Alec dive over-board and his mate leap for our bowsprit. Then  came the crash as we struck the boat, and a series of grinding bumps as  it passed under our bottom.    \"That fixes his rifle,\" I heard Charley mutter, as he sprang upon the  deck to look for Big Alec somewhere astern.    The wind and sea quickly stopped our forward movement, and we began to  drift backward over the spot where the skiff had been. Big Alec's black  head and swarthy face popped up within arm's reach; and all  unsuspecting and very angry with what he took to be the clumsiness of  amateur sailors, he was hauled aboard. Also he was out of breath, for  he had dived deep and stayed down long to escape our keel.    The next instant, to the perplexity and consternation of the owner,  Charley was on top of Big Alec in the cockpit, and I was helping bind  him with gaskets. The owner was dancing excitedly about and demanding  an explanation, but by that time Big Alec's partner had crawled aft  from the bowsprit and was peering apprehensively over the rail into the  cockpit. Charley's arm shot around his neck and the man landed on his  back beside Big Alec.    \"More gaskets!\" Charley shouted, and I made haste to supply them.    The wrecked skiff was rolling sluggishly a short distance to windward,  and I trimmed the sheets while Charley took the wheel and steered for  it.    \"These two men are old offenders,\" he explained to the angry owner;  \"and they are most persistent violators of the fish and game laws. You  have seen them caught in the act, and you may expect to be subpoenaed as  witness for the state when the trial comes off.\"    As he spoke he rounded alongside the skiff. It had been torn from the  line, a section of which was dragging to it. He hauled in forty or  fifty feet with a young sturgeon still fast in a tangle of barbless  hooks, slashed that much of the line free with his knife, and tossed it  into the cockpit beside the prisoners.    \"And there's the evidence, Exhibit A, for the people,\" Charley  continued. \"Look it over carefully so that you may identify it in the  court-room with the time and place of capture.\"    And then, in triumph, with no more veering and yawing, we sailed into  Benicia, the King of the Greeks bound hard and fast in the cockpit, and  for the first time in his life a prisoner of the fish patrol.          III    A RAID ON THE OYSTER  PIRATES      Of the fish patrolmen under whom we served at various times, Charley Le  Grant and I were agreed, I think, that Neil Partington was the best. He  was neither dishonest nor cowardly; and while he demanded strict  obedience when we were under his orders, at the same time our relations  were those of easy comradeship, and he permitted us a freedom to which  we were ordinarily unaccustomed, as the present story will show.    Neil's family lived in Oakland, which is on the Lower Bay, not more  than six miles across the water from San Francisco. One day, while  scouting among the Chinese shrimp-catchers of Point Pedro, he received  word that his wife was very ill; and within the hour the _Reindeer_ was  bowling along for Oakland, with a stiff northwest breeze astern. We ran  up the Oakland Estuary and came to anchor, and in the days that  followed, while Neil was ashore, we tightened up the _Reindeer's_  rigging, overhauled the ballast, scraped down, and put the sloop into  thorough shape.    This done, time hung heavy on our hands. Neil's wife was dangerously  ill, and the outlook was a week's lie-over, awaiting the crisis. Charley  and I roamed the docks, wondering what we should do, and so came upon  the oyster fleet lying at the Oakland City Wharf. In the main they were  trim, natty boats, made for speed and bad weather, and we sat down on  the stringer-piece of the dock to study them.    \"A good catch, I guess,\" Charley said, pointing to the heaps of oysters,  assorted in three sizes, which lay upon their decks.    Pedlers were backing their wagons to the edge of the  wharf, and from the bargaining and chaffering that went on, I managed to  learn the selling price of the oysters.    \"That boat must have at least two hundred dollars' worth aboard,\" I  calculated. \"I wonder how long it took to get the load?\"    \"Three or four days,\" Charley answered. \"Not bad wages for two  men--twenty-five dollars a day apiece.\"    The boat we were discussing, the _Ghost_, lay directly beneath us. Two  men composed its crew. One was a squat, broad-shouldered fellow with  remarkably long and gorilla-like arms, while the other was tall and  well proportioned, with clear blue eyes and a mat of straight black  hair. So unusual and striking was this combination of hair and eyes  that Charley and I remained somewhat longer than we intended.    And it was well that we did.

[For example, \"large,\" \"red,\" \"old,\" \"which I received      yesterday.\"]    One Thing may have many Attributes; and one Attribute may belong to many  Things.        [Thus, the Thing \"a rose\" may have the Attributes \"red,\"      \"scented,\" \"full-blown,\" &c.; and the Attribute \"red\" may belong      to the Things \"a rose,\" \"a brick,\" \"a ribbon,\" &c.]    Any Attribute, or any Set of Attributes, may be called an '=Adjunct=.'        [This word is introduced in order to avoid the constant      repetition of the phrase \"Attribute or Set of Attributes.\"        Thus, we may say that a rose has the Attribute \"red\" (or the      Adjunct \"red,\" whichever we prefer); or we may say that it has      the Adjunct \"red, scented and full-blown.\"]                                                                       pg001 1/2    CHAPTER II.    _CLASSIFICATION._      'Classification,' or the formation of Classes, is a Mental Process, in  which we imagine that we have put together, in a group, certain Things.  Such a group is called a '=Class=.'    This Process may be performed in three different ways, as follows:--    (1) We may imagine that we have put together all Things. The Class so  formed (i.e. the Class \"Things\") contains the whole Universe.    (2) We may think of the Class \"Things,\" and may imagine that we have  picked out from it all the Things which possess a certain Adjunct _not_  possessed by the whole Class. This Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to  the Class so formed. In this case, the Class \"Things\" is called a  '=Genus=' with regard to the Class so formed: the Class, so formed, is  called a '=Species=' of the Class \"Things\": and its peculiar Adjunct is  called its '=Differentia='.                                                                     pg002  As this Process is entirely _Mental_, we can perform it whether there  _is_, or _is not_, an _existing_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct. If  there _is_, the Class is said to be '=Real='; if not, it is said to be  '=Unreal=', or '=Imaginary=.'        [For example, we may imagine that we have picked out, from the      Class \"Things,\" all the Things which possess the Adjunct      \"material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets\"; and we      may thus form the Real Class \"towns.\" Here we may regard      \"Things\" as a _Genus_, \"Towns\" as a _Species_ of Things, and      \"material, artificial, consisting of houses and streets\" as its      _Differentia_.        Again, we may imagine that we have picked out all the Things      which possess the Adjunct \"weighing a ton, easily lifted by a      baby\"; and we may thus form the _Imaginary_ Class \"Things that      weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby.\"]    (3) We may think of a certain Class, _not_ the Class \"Things,\" and may  imagine that we have picked out from it all the Members of it which  possess a certain Adjunct _not_ possessed by the whole Class. This  Adjunct is said to be '=peculiar=' to the smaller Class so formed. In  this case, the Class thought of is called a '=Genus=' with regard to the  smaller Class picked out from it: the smaller Class is called a  '=Species=' of the larger: and its peculiar Adjunct is called its  '=Differentia='.        [For example, we may think of the Class \"towns,\" and imagine      that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the      Attribute \"lit with gas\"; and we may thus form the Real Class      \"towns lit with gas.\" Here we may regard \"Towns\" as a _Genus_,      \"Towns lit with gas\" as a _Species_ of Towns, and \"lit with gas\"      as its _Differentia_.        If, in the above example, we were to alter \"lit with gas\" into      \"paved with gold,\" we should get the _Imaginary_ Class \"towns      paved with gold.\"]    A Class, containing only _one_ Member is called an '=Individual=.'        [For example, the Class \"towns having four million inhabitants,\"      which Class contains only _one_ Member, viz. \"London.\"]                                                                     pg002 1/2  Hence, any single Thing, which we can name so as to distinguish it from  all other Things, may be regarded as a one-Member Class.        [Thus \"London\" may be regarded as the one-Member Class, picked      out from the Class \"towns,\" which has, as its Differentia,      \"having four million inhabitants.\"]    A Class, containing two or more Members, is sometimes regarded as _one  single Thing_. When so regarded, it may possess an Adjunct which is  _not_ possessed by any Member of it taken separately.        [Thus, the Class \"The soldiers of the Tenth Regiment,\" when      regarded as _one single Thing_, may possess the Attribute      \"formed in square,\" which is _not_ possessed by any Member of it      taken separately.]                                                                       pg003    CHAPTER III.    _DIVISION._      Sec. 1.    _Introductory._    'Division' is a Mental Process, in which we think of a certain Class of  Things, and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller  Classes.        [Thus, we might think of the Class \"books,\" and imagine that we      had divided it into the two smaller Classes \"bound books\" and      \"unbound books,\" or into the three Classes, \"books priced at      less than a shilling,\" \"shilling-books,\" \"books priced at more      than a shilling,\" or into the twenty-six Classes, \"books whose      names begin with _A_,\" \"books whose names begin with _B_,\" &c.]    A Class, that has been obtained by a certain Division, is said to be  'codivisional' with every Class obtained by that Division.        [Thus, the Class \"bound books\" is codivisional with each of the      two Classes, \"bound books\" and \"unbound books.\"        Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been      \"contemporary\" with every event that happened in 1815.]    Hence a Class, obtained by Division, is codivisional with itself.        [Thus, the Class \"bound books\" is codivisional with itself.        Similarly, the Battle of Waterloo may be said to have been      \"contemporary\" with itself.]                                                                       pg003 1/2  Sec. 2.    _Dichotomy._    If we think of a certain Class, and imagine that we have picked out from  it a certain smaller Class, it is evident that the _Remainder_ of the  large Class does _not_ possess the Differentia of that smaller Class.  Hence it may be regarded as _another_ smaller Class, whose Differentia  may be formed, from that of the Class first picked out, by prefixing the  word \"not\"; and we may imagine that we have _divided_ the Class first  thought of into _two_ smaller Classes, whose Differentiae are  _contradictory_. This kind of Division is called '=Dichotomy='.        [For example, we may divide \"books\" into the two Classes whose      Differentiae are \"old\" and \"not-old.\"]    In performing this Process, we may sometimes find that the Attributes we  have chosen are used so loosely, in ordinary conversation, that it is  not easy to decide _which_ of the Things belong to the one Class and  _which_ to the other. In such a case, it would be necessary to lay down  some arbitrary _rule_, as to _where_ the one Class should end and the  other begin.        [Thus, in dividing \"books\" into \"old\" and \"not-old,\" we may say      \"Let all books printed before A.D. 1801, be regarded as 'old,'      and all others as 'not-old'.\"]    Henceforwards let it be understood that, if a Class of Things be divided  into two Classes, whose Differentiae have contrary meanings, each  Differentia is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word  \"not\" prefixed.        [Thus, if \"books\" be divided into \"old\" and \"new\" the Attribute      \"old\" is to be regarded as equivalent to \"not-new,\" and the      Attribute \"new\" as equivalent to \"not-old.\"]                                                                     pg004  After dividing a Class, by the Process of _Dichotomy_, into two smaller  Classes, we may sub-divide each of these into two still smaller Classes;  and this Process may be repeated over and over again, the number of  Classes being doubled at each repetition.        [For example, we may divide \"books\" into \"old\" and \"new\" (i.e.      \"_not_-old\"): we may then sub-divide each of these into      \"English\" and \"foreign\" (i.e. \"_not_-English\"), thus getting      _four_ Classes, viz.            (1) old English;          (2) old foreign;          (3) new English;          (4) new foreign.        If we had begun by dividing into \"English\" and \"foreign,\" and      had then sub-divided into \"old\" and \"new,\" the four Classes      would have been            (1) English old;          (2) English new;          (3) foreign old;          (4) foreign new.        The Reader will easily see that these are the very same four      Classes which we had before.]                                                                       pg004 1/2    CHAPTER IV.    _NAMES._      The word \"Thing\", which conveys the idea of a Thing, _without_ any idea  of an Adjunct, represents _any_ single Thing. Any other word (or  phrase), which conveys the idea of a Thing, _with_ the idea of an  Adjunct represents _any_ Thing which possesses that Adjunct; i.e., it  represents any Member of the Class to which that Adjunct is _peculiar_.    Such a word (or phrase) is called a '=Name='; and, if there be an  existing Thing which it represents, it is said to be a Name of that  Thing.        [For example, the words \"Thing,\" \"Treasure,\" \"Town,\" and the      phrases \"valuable Thing,\" \"material artificial Thing consisting      of houses and streets,\" \"Town lit with gas,\" \"Town paved with      gold,\" \"old English Book.\"]    Just as a Class is said to be _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there  _is_, or _is not_, an existing Thing in it, so also a Name is said to be  _Real_, or _Unreal_, according as there"]]]
