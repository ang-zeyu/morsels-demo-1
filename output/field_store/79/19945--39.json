To use  his own language, \"guilty without remorse, he soon become so without  measure.\"    Thomas Paine was, according to the verdict of history, \"addicted to  intemperance in his last years, given to violence and abusiveness, had  disreputable associates, lived with a woman who was not his wife, and left  to her whatever remnant of fortune he had.\"    What would such godless infidels give us if the Almighty God should \"pour  the petroleum of authority upon their heads?\" But, in all candor, what use  has Col. Ingersoll for the _idea of authority coming from God_? Can't he  keep in his own ruts. \"The DIVINE petroleum of authority was never poured  upon the head of _Thomas Paine's father_.\" Well, so much the better for  the reputation of God. But why does Mr. Ingersoll use the term God, and  have so much to say of Him? Let us hear him. He says, whoever is a friend  of man is also a friend of God--if there is one. Yes! \"IS THERE IS ONE.\"  This reminds me of an old infidel who was struggling with the cramp colic,  and just as a minister was approaching his bedside he turned himself over  in the bed and said, O Lord, if there is any Lord, save my soul, if I've  got any soul. The minister walked out. What is the condition of those  minds which modify their declarations with the saying \"if there is any  Lord,\" \"if there is one,\" \"if I've got any soul.\" How much more manly is  it to own the great universal and instinctive or inate truth, that there  is a Master, God, or great first Living Intelligence, and cease acting  foolishly.    Once more, the colonel, speaking of Thomas Paine's work, says, \"He was  with the army. He shared its defeats, its dangers, and its glory. When the  situation became desperate, when gloom settled upon all, he gave them the  'Crisis.' It was a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, leading the  way to freedom, honor and glory.\" What use has the colonel for such  language? From whence did it come? Is he sitting upon the bones of Moses  and making grimaces at the old prophet while he is adopting his sentences?  Infidels blaspheme the name of Moses, and abuse his hyperboles and his  facts as well, and, at the same time, go to his quiver to get their very  best arrows.    \"At the close of the Revolution no one stood higher in America than Thomas  Paine.\"--_Ingersoll._    \"At that time the seeds sown by the great infidels were beginning to bear  fruit in France.\"--_Ingersoll._    _Well, well._ To what \"mount\" have we come at last? Paine sailed to France  in 1787. \"He was elected to represent the Department of Calais in the  National Convention, and took his seat in that radical assembly in 1792.\"  At this time Col. Ingersoll's church had everything its own way in France.  There was no God to respect or devil to fear. \"Free thought\" ruled--its  reign was a reign of night. The goddess of reason was the \"twin sister of  the Spanish Inquisition.\" The soldiers were in power, and great hearts  were made to bleed. Three hundred and sixty-six men in the National  Convention voted for the death of the king. Three hundred and fifty-five  voted against his execution. It is true that Tom Paine was one of the  three hundred and fifty-five. A year after the king's execution Tom was  put into prison, and remained there nearly two years. When he was released  he wrote the second part of the Age of Reason, and in 1802 he came back to  America. What he did for American liberty was done while he was a Quaker,  and before he wrote his detestable works against the Bible. Let some bold  infidel produce just one noble public act that Paine did for our country  after he avowed himself an infidel. _Will it be done?_    The leaders of the French revolution were the disciples of Rousseau,  Voltaire and Diderot. They were atheists, or infidels. Tom Paine was one  of their number, participated in their deliberations, helped to get up the  constitution they enacted. What they did is what the infidels of the  United States wish to have done. They wiped out Christianity by vote, and  forbade the utterance of the name of God to their children. They abolished  the Lord's day, and made the week to consist of _ten_ instead of seven  days. They took the bells from the churches and cast them into cannons.  Chaumette, a leader in the convention, came before the president \"leading  a courtesan with a troop of her associates.\" He lifted her veil, and said,  \"Mortals! recognize no other divinity than Reason, of which I present to  you the loveliest and purest personification.\" The president bowed and  rendered devout adoration. The same scene was reenacted in the cathedral  of Notre Dame, with increased outrages upon God and common-sense. Wrong  was reputed right, and the distinction between vice and virtue was  banished.    From this time, and onward, the test of attachment to the government was  contempt for religion and decency. Those suspected of disloyalty were  gathered; one thousand and five hundred women and children were shut up in  one prison, without fire, bed, cover, or provisions, for two days. Men  escaped by giving up their fortunes, and women escaped by parting with  their virtue.    Seventeen thousand perished in Paris during this reign of infidel terror.  This ungodly abrogation of religion in France cost the nation three  million of lives--_think of it!_ France's most dark and damning record was  the fruit of the tenets of the men that Col. Ingersoll lauds to the  heavens. They were the fruits of the labors of the men with whom Tom Paine  sat, and believed, and voted. \"His faith was their faith.\"    \"It was the Quaker Paine who worked for our independence, and not the  infidel Paine. He did nothing in the interests of our national liberty  after he avowed his irreligious principles.\" Neither was he the first to  raise the voice in favor of national liberty. Ten years before he wrote  his work entitled \"Common Sense,\" at the suggestion of Franklin and Dr.  Benjamin Rush, which was in 1776, Patrick Henry's voice was heard amid the  assembled colonists in Virginia. He said: \"Caesar had his Brutus, Charles  I. his Cromwell, and George III.--\" Just then some one cried out,  \"Treason!\" After a pause, Henry added,--\"may profit by their example.\"  Years before Tom Paine came to America, even in 1748, it went to record  that American legislatures were tending to independence. \"They were  charged with presumption in declaring their own rights and privileges.\"  Our independence was predicted near at hand from 1758 and onwards. In  1774, before Paine came from England, the word freedom was ringing out  upon the air. \"James Otis was hailing the dawn of a new empire\" in 1765.  In this year there were utterances of such sentiments as tended to evolve  the declaration of 1776, and these were heard all over the land from  Boston to Charleston, S. C. In 1773 \"Samuel Adams insisted that the  colonies should have a congress to frame a bill of rights, or to form an  independent state, an American commonwealth.\" The North Carolinians  renounced their allegiance to the king of England in the Mecklenberg  declaration, which was made in May, 1775. But Paine's little book,  suggested by Dr. Benjamin Rush and Franklin, and called \"Common Sense,\"  was published in 1776. Hildreth, writing of the year 1802, says that  \"Paine, instead of being esteemed as formerly, as a lover of liberty,  whose pen has contributed to hasten the Declaration of Independence, was  now detested by large numbers as the libeler of Washington.\" In 1795 the  _Aurora_ put out the following language, which seems to be that to which  Hildreth alludes: \"If ever a nation was debauched by a man, the American  nation was debauched by Washington; if ever a nation was deceived by a  man, the American nation has been deceived by Washington. Let the history  of the federal government instruct mankind, that the mask of patriotism  may be worn to conceal the foulest designs against the liberties of the  people.\" This, gentle reader, was from the pen of the man whom Mr.  Ingersoll would immortalize if he could.    William Carver addressed a private letter to Thomas Paine, dated Dec. 2,  1806, and published in the New York _Observer_ Nov. 1, 1877, in which we  have the following revelations: \"A respectable gentleman from New Rochelle  called to see me a few days back, and said that every body was tired of  you there and that no one would undertake to board and lodge you. I  thought this was the case, as I found you at a tavern in a most miserable  situation. You appeared as if you had not been shaved for a fortnight, and  as to a shirt, it could not be said that you had one on, it was only the  remains of one, and this likewise appeared not to have been off your back  for a fortnight, and was nearly the color of tanned leather; and you had  the most disagreeable smell possible, just like that of our poor beggars  in England. Do you remember the pains I took to clean you? That I got a  tub of warm water and soap, and washed you from head to foot, and this I  had to do three times before I could get you clean? You say also that you  found your own liquors during the time you boarded with me, but you should  have said, 'I found only a small part of the liquor I drank during my stay  with you; this part I purchased of John Fellows, which was a demijohn of  brandy containing four gallons, and this did not serve me three weeks.'  This can be proved, and I mean not to say anything I can not prove, for I  hold this as a precious jewel. It is a well-known fact that you drank one  quart of brandy per day, at my expense, during the different times that  you have boarded with me, the demijohn alone mentioned excepted, and the  last fourteen weeks you were sick. Is not this a supply of liquor for  dinner and supper? Now sir, I think I have drawn a complete portrait of  your character, yet, to enter upon every minutia, would be to give a  history of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2832"],[0,"Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. 1 (of 2) (#5)"],[1,"to Ahone. And this  evidence, I think, distinctly proves that such a being as Ahone was  within the capacity of the Indians in these latitudes. Mr. Tylor must  have thought in 1891 that the natives were competent to a belief in a  supreme deity, for he said, \"Another famous native American name for the  supreme deity is Oki\".(3) In the essay of 1892, however, Oki does not  appear to exist as a god's name till 1724. We may now, for earlier  evidence, turn to Master Thomas Heriot, \"that learned mathematician\"  \"who spoke the Indian language,\" and was with the company which  abandoned Virginia on 18th June, 1586. They ranged 130 miles north  and 130 miles north-west of Roanoke Island, which brings them into the  neighbourhood of Smith's and Strachey's country. Heriot writes as to the  native creeds: \"They believe that there are many gods which they call  Mantoac, but of different sorts and degrees. Also that there is one  chiefe God that hath beene from all eternitie, who, as they say, when he  purposed first to make the world, made first other gods of a principall  order, to be as instruments to be used in the Creation and Government to  follow, and after the Sunne, Moone and Starres as pettie gods, and the  instruments of the other order more principall.... They thinke that all  the gods are of humane shape,\" and represent them by anthropomorphic  idols. An idol, or image, \"Kewasa\" (the plural is \"Kewasowok\"),  is placed in the temples, \"where they worship, pray and make many  offerings\". Good souls go to be happy with the gods, the bad burn in  Popogusso, a great pit, \"where the sun sets\". The evidence for this  theory of a future life, as usual, is that of men who died and revived  again, a story found in a score of widely separated regions, down to our  day, when the death, revival and revelation occurred to the founder  of the Arapahoe new religion of the Ghost Dance. The belief \"works for  righteousness\". \"The common sort... have great care to avoyde torment  after death, and to enjoy blesse,\" also they have \"great respect to  their Governors\".      (1) Okee's image, as early as 1607, was borne into battle against Smith,  who captured the god (Arber, p. 393). Ahone was not thus en evidence.    (2) Journal of Anthrop. Inst., Feb., 1892, pp. 285, 286.    (3) Prim. Cult,, ii. p. 342.      This belief in a chief god \"from all eternitie\" (that is, of unexplained  origin), may not be convenient to some speculators, but it exactly  corroborates Strachey's account of Ahone as creator with subordinates.  The evidence is of 1586 (twenty-six years before Strachey), and,  like Strachey, Heriot attributes the whole scheme of belief to \"the  priestes\". \"This is the sum of their religion, which I learned by having  speciall familiaritie with some of their priests.\"(1) I see no escape  from the conclusion that the Virginians believed as Heriot says they  did, except the device of alleging that they promptly borrowed some of  Heriot's ideas and maintained that these ideas had ever been their own.  Heriot certainly did not recognise the identity. \"Through conversing  with us they were brought into great doubts of their owne (religion),  and no small admiration of ours; of which many desired to learne more  than we had the meanes for want of utterance in their language to  expresse.\" So Heriot could not be subtle in the native tongue. Heriot  did what he could to convert them: \"I did my best to make His immortall  glory knowne\". His efforts were chiefly successful by virtue of the  savage admiration of our guns, mathematical instruments, and so forth.  These sources of an awakened interest in Christianity would vanish  with the total destruction and discomfiture of the colony, unless a few  captives, later massacred, taught our religion to the natives.(2)      (1) According to Strachey, Heriot could speak the native language.    (2) Heriot's Narrative, pp. 37-39. Quaritch, London, 1893.      I shall cite another early example of a New England deity akin to Ahone,  with a deputy, a friend of sorcerers, like Okee. This account is in  Smith's General History of New England, 1606-1624. We sent out a colony  in 1607; \"they all returned in the yeere 1608,\" esteeming the country \"a  cold, barren, mountainous rocky desart\". I am apt to believe that  they did not plant the fructifying seeds of grace among the natives in  1607-1608. But the missionary efforts of French traders may, of course,  have been blessed; nor can I deny that a yellow-haired man, whose corpse  was found in 1620 with some objects of iron, may have converted the  natives to such beliefs as they possessed. We are told, however, that  these tenets were of ancestral antiquity. I cite E. Winslow, as edited  by Smith (1623-24):--    \"Those where in this Plantation (New Plymouth) say Kiehtan(1) made all  the other Gods: also one man and one woman, and with them all mankinde,  but how they became so dispersed they know not. They say that at first  there was no king but Kiehtan, that dwelleth far westerly above the  heavens, whither all good men go when they die, and have plentie of all  things. The bad go thither also and knock at the door, but ('the door is  shut') he bids them go wander in endless want and misery, for they shall  not stay there. They never saw Kiehtan,(2) but they hold it a great  charge and dutie that one race teach another; and to him they make  feasts and cry and sing for plenty and victory, or anything that is  good.      (1) In 1873 Mr. Tylor regarded Dr. Brinton's etymology of Kiehtan as =  Kittanitowit = \"Great Living Spirit,\" as \"plausible\". In his edition  of 1891 he omits this etymology. Personally I entirely distrust the  philological theories of the original sense of old divine names as a  general rule.    (2) \"They never saw Kiehtan.\" So, about 1854, \"The common answer  of intelligent black fellows on the Barwon when asked if they know  Baiame... is this: 'Kamil zaia zummi Baiame, zaia winuzgulda'; 'I have  not seen Baiame, I have heard or perceived him'. If asked who made  the sky, the earth, the animals and man, they always answer 'Baiame'.\"  Daramulun, according to the same authority in Lang's Queensland, was  the familiar of sorcerers, and appeared as a serpent. This answers, as I  show, to Hobamock the subordinate power to Kiehtan in New England and to  Okee, the familiar of sorcerers in Virginia. (Ridley, J. A. I., 1872, p.  277.)      \"They have another Power they call Hobamock, which we conceive the  Devill, and upon him they call to cure their wounds and diseases; when  they are curable he persuades them he sent them, because they have  displeased him; but, if they be mortal, then he saith, 'Kiehtan sent  them'; which makes them never call on him in their sickness. They say  this Hobamock appears to them sometimes like a man, a deer, or an eagle,  but most commonly like a snake; not to all but to their Powahs to cure  diseases, and Undeses... and these are such as conjure in Virginia, and  cause the people to do what they list.\" Winslow (or rather Smith editing  Winslow here), had already said, \"They believe, as do the Virginians,  of many divine powers, yet of one above all the rest, as the Southern  Virginians call their chief god Kewassa (an error), and that we now  inhabit Oke.... The Massachusetts call their great god Kiehtan.\"(1)      (1) Arber, pp. 767, 768.      Here, then, in Heriot (1586), Strachey (1611-12) and Winslow (1622), we  find fairly harmonious accounts of a polydaemonism with a chief, primal,  creative being above and behind it; a being unnamed, and Ahone and  Kiehtan.    Is all this invention? Or was all this derived from Europeans before  1586, and, if so, from what Europeans? Mr. Tylor, in 1873, wrote, \"After  due allowance made for misrendering of savage answers, and importation  of white men's thoughts, it can hardly be judged that a divine being,  whose characteristics are often so unlike what European intercourse  would have suggested, and who is heard of by such early explorers among  such distant tribes, could be a deity of foreign origin\". NOW, he \"can  HARDLY be ALTOGETHER a deity of foreign origin\".(1) I agree with  Mr. Tylor's earlier statement. In my opinion Ahone--Okeus,  Kiehtan--Hobamock, correspond, the first pair to the usually unseen  Australian Baiame (a crystal or hypnotic vision of Baiame scarcely  counts), while the second pair, Okeus and Hobamock, answer to the  Australian familiars of sorcerers, Koin and Brewin; the American  \"Powers\" being those of peoples on a higher level of culture. Like  Tharramulun where Baiame is supreme, Hobamock appears as a snake  (Asclepius).      (1) Prim. Cult., ii. 340, 1873, 1892.      For all these reasons I am inclined to accept Strachey's Ahone as a  veritable element in Virginian belief. Without temple or service, such a  being was not conspicuous, like Okee and other gods which had idols and  sacrifices.    As far as I see, Strachey has no theory to serve by inventing Ahone. He  asks how any races \"if descended from the people of the first creation,  should maintain so general and gross a defection from the true knowledge  of God\". He is reduced to suppose that, as descendants of Ham, they  inherit \"the ignorance of true godliness.\" (p. 45). The children of Shem  and Japheth alone \"retained, until the coming of the Messias, the only  knowledge of the eternal and never-changing Trinity\". The Virginians,  on the other hand, fell heir to the ignorance, and \"fearful and  superstitious instinct of nature\" of Ham (p. 40). Ahone, therefore, is  not invented by Strachey to bolster up a theory (held by Strachey),  of an inherited revelation, or of a sensus numinis which could not go  wrong. Unless a proof be given that Strachey had a theory, or any other  purpose, to serve by inventing Ahone, I cannot at present come into the  opinion that he gratuitously fabled, though he may have unconsciously  exaggerated.    What were Strachey's sources? He was"]]]
