There were gingerbread and \"cacks\" even in the  earliest days; but they were not sold in unlimited numbers. The  omnipotent hand of Puritan law laid its firm hold on their manufacture.  Judge Sewall often speaks, however, of Banbury cakes and Meers cakes;  Meer was a celebrated Boston baker and confectioner. The colonists had  also egg cakes and marchepanes and maccaroons.    There were children's books in those early days; not numerous, however,  nor varied was the assortment from which Puritan youth in New England  could choose. Here is the advertisement of one:         \"Small book in easey verse Very Suitable for children, entitled The       Prodigal Daughter or the Disobedient Lady Reclaimed: adorned with       curious cuts, Price Sixpence.\"    Somehow, from the suggestion of the title we should hardly fancy this to  be an edifying book for children. John Cotton supplied them with         \"Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes in Either England: Drawn out of       the Breasts of both Testaments for their Souls Nourishment. But       may be of like Use to Any Children.\"    Another book was published in many editions and sold in large numbers,  and much extolled by contemporary ministers. It was entitled:         \"A Token for Children. Being the exact account of the Conversion &       Holy & Exemplary Lives of several Young Children by James Janeway.\"    To it was added by Cotton Mather:         \"Some examples of Children in whom the fear of God was remarkably       Budding before they died; in several parts of New England.\"    Cotton Mather also wrote: \"Good Lessons for Children, in Verse.\" Other  books were, \"A Looking Glasse for Children,\" \"The life of Elizabeth  Butcher, in the Early Piety series;\" \"The life of Mary Paddock, who died  at the age of nine;\" \"The Childs new Plaything\" (which was a primer);  \"Divine Songs in Easy Language;\" and \"Praise out of the Mouth of Babes;\"  \"A Particular Account of some Extraordinary Pious Motions and devout  Exercises observed of late in many Children in Siberia.\" Also accounts  of pious motions of children in Silesia and of Jewish children in  Berlin. One oasis appeared in the desert waste--after the first quarter  of the eighteenth century Puritan children had Mother Goose.    By 1787, in Isaiah Thomas' list of \"books Suitable for Children of all  ages,\" we find less serious books. \"Tom Jones Abridged,\" \"Peregrine  Pickle Abridged,\" \"Vice in its Proper Shape,\" \"The Sugar Plumb,\" \"Bag of  Nuts Ready Crack'd,\" \"Jacky Dandy,\" \"History of Billy and Polly  Friendly.\" Among the \"Chapman's Books for the Edification and Amusement  of young Men and Women who are not able to Purchase those of a Higher  Price\" are, \"The Amours and Adventures of Two English Gentlemen in  Italy,\" \"Fifteen Comforts of Matrimony,\" \"The Lovers Secretary,\" and  \"Laugh and be Fat.\" Another advertisement of about the same date  contained, among the books for misses, \"The Masqued Wedding,\" \"The  Elopement,\" \"The Passionate Lovers,\" \"Sketches of the History and  Importance of the Fair Sex,\" \"Original Love Letters,\" and \"Six Dialogues  of Young Misses Relating to Matrimony;\" thus showing that love-stories  were not abhorred by the descendants of the Puritans.    In such an exceptional plantation as New England, a colony peopled not  by the commonplace and average Englishmen of the day, but by men of  special intelligence, and almost universally of good education, it was  inevitable that early and profound attention should be paid to the  establishment of schools. Cotton Mather said in 1685, in his sermon  before the Governor and his Council, \"the Youth in this country are  verie Sharp and early Ripe in their Capacities.\" So quickly had New  England air developed the typical New England traits. And the early  schoolmasters, too, may be thanked for their scholars' early ripeness  and sharpness.    At an early age both girls and boys were sent to dame-schools, where, if  girls were not taught much book-learning, they were carefully instructed  in all housewifely arts. They learned to cook; and to spin and weave and  knit, not only for home wear but for the shops; even little children  could spin coarse tow string and knit coarse socks for shop-keepers.  Fine knitting was well paid for, and was a matter of much pride to the  knitter, and many curious and elaborate stitches were known; the  herring-bone and the fox- and geese-patterns being prime favorites.  Initials were knit into mittens and stockings; one clever young miss of  Shelburne, N. H., could knit the alphabet and a verse of poetry into a  single pair of mittens. Fine embroidery was to New England women and  girls a delight. The Indians at an early day called the English women  \"lazie Squaes\" when they saw the latter embroidering coifs instead of  digging in the fields. Mr. Brownell, the Boston schoolmaster in 1716,  taught \"Young Gentle Women and Children all sorts of Fine Works as  Feather works, Filigree, and Painting on Glass, Embroidering a new Way,  Turkey-work for Handkerchiefs two new Ways, fine new Fashion purses,  flourishing and plain Work.\" We find a Newport dame teaching \"Sewing,  Marking, Queen Stitch and Knitting,\" and a Boston shopkeeper taking  children and young ladies to board and be taught \"Dresden and Embroidery  on gauze, Tent Stitch and all sorts of Colour'd Work.\" Crewels,  embroidery, silks, and chenilles appear frequently in early newspapers.  Many of the fruits of these careful lessons of colonial childhood  remain to us; quaint samplers, bed hangings, petticoats and pockets, and  frail lace veils and scarfs. Miss Susan Hayes Ward has resuscitated from  these old embroideries a curious stitch used to great effect on many of  them, and employed also on ancient Persian embroideries, and she points  out that the designs are Persian also. This stitch was not known in the  modern English needlework schools; but just as good old Elizabethan  words and phrases are still used in New England, though obsolete in  England, so this curious old stitch has lived in the colony when lost in  the mother country; or, it may be possible, since it is found so  frequently in the vicinity of Plymouth, that the Pilgrims obtained both  stitch and designs in Holland, whose greater commerce with the Orient  may have supplied to deft English fingers the Persian pattern.    Other accomplishments were taught to girls; \"cutting of Escutcheons\" and  paper flowers--\"Papyrotamia\" it was ambitiously called--and painting on  velvet; and quilt-piecing in a hundred different and difficult designs.  They also learned to make bone lace with pillow and bobbins.    The boys were thrust at once into that iron-handed but wholly wise  grasp--the Latin Grammar. The minds trained in earliest youth in that  study, as it was then taught, have made their deep and noble impress on  this nation. The study of mathematics was, until well into this century,  a hopeless maze to many youthful minds. Doubtless the Puritans learned  multiplication tables and may have found them, as did Marjorie Fleming,  \"a horrible and wretched plaege,\" though no pious little New Englanders  would have dared to say as she did, \"You cant conceive it the most  Devilish thing is 8 times 8 and 7 times 7, it is what nature itself  can't endure.\"    Great attention was paid to penmanship. Spelling was nought if the  \"wrighting\" were only fair and flowing. I have never read any criticism  of teachers by either parents or town officers save on the one question  of writing. How deeply children were versed or grounded in the knowledge  of the proper use of \"Simme colings nots of interiogations peorids and  commoes,\" I do not know. A boundless freedom apparently was given, as  was also in orthography--if we judge from the letters of the times,  where \"horrid false spells,\" as Cotton Mather called them, abound.    It is natural to dwell on the religious teaching of Puritan children,  because so much of their education had a religious element in it. They  must have felt, like Tony Lumpkin, \"tired of having good dinged into  'em.\" Their primers taught religious rhymes; they read from the Bible,  the Catechism, the Psalm Book, and that lurid rhymed horror \"The Day of  Doom;\" they parsed, too, from these universal books. How did they parse  these lines from the Bay Psalm Book?        \"And sayd He would not them waste; had not          Moses stood (whom he chose)      'fore him i' th' breach; to turn his wrath          lest that he should waste those.\"    Their \"horn books\"--                  \"books of stature small      Which with pellucid horn secured are      To save from fingers wet the letters fair,\"    those framed and behandled sheets of semi-transparent horn, which were  worn hanging at the side and were studied, as late certainly as the year  1715 by children of the Pilgrims, also managed to instil with the  alphabet some religious words or principles. Usually the Lord's Prayer  formed part of the printed text. Though horn-books are referred to in  Sewall's diary and in the letters of Wait Still Winthrop, and appear on  stationers' and booksellers' lists at the beginning of the eighteenth  century, I do not know of the preservation of a single specimen to our  own day.    The schoolhouses were simple dwellings, often tumbling down and out of  repair. The Roxbury teacher wrote in 1681:         \"Of inconveniences [in the schoolhouse] I shall mention no other       but the confused and shattered and nastie posture that it is in,       not fitting for to reside in, the glass broke, and thereupon very       raw and cold; the floor very much broken and torn up to kindle       fires, the hearth spoiled, the seats some burned and others out of       kilter, that one had well-nigh as goods keep school in a hog stie       as in it.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24186"],[0,"Zionism and Anti-Semitism (#5)"],[1,"s, and they have no mind to  exchange these names for any other. But a new \"Hep Hep\" was wanted,  and so \"Semites\" was hauled from the world of books, disfigured, and  fastened upon the Jewish gabardine in noble emulation of the barbarism  of the Middle Ages. The more senseless, the more welcome it was as a  bugbear to frighten the populace and to stir into flames the sparks of  fanaticism which are always smouldering in the hearts of the vulgar,  whether of low degree or high degree, worldly or ghostly.    The strangest thing, however, in this learned falsification is that  it should have succeeded so well with people calling themselves  Christians and clinging to that name often after they have given up  all its historic substance. Is Christianity not purely Semitic at the  core? Is it not based upon the Semitic conception of the relation  between man and his Creator? The great efforts to liberalize and  rationalize the Church which the last century witnessed, up to  Professor Harnack's recent attempt to sum up \"Das Wesen des  Christenthums,\"--what are all these but endeavors to free it from  foreign accretions and envelopments and to bring its Semitic character  into greater prominence?    It is the only Asiatic conception of religion that has subdued Europe  and America, and that still holds undisputed sway over all its diverse  nationalities. The very name which symbolizes to them all that is  noblest, purest, and most blessed, points to that source as  unfailingly as the needle of the compass to the poles. Harnack claims  that Christianity is not one religion amongst others, but _The  Religion_, the only one fulfilling all the conditions of its highest  ideal. The Being in whom that fulness of light was revealed,--was he  not a Semite of the Semites? Did he ever deny his origin? Christianity  means _Messianity_, and the whole idea of a Mashiach,--the anointed,  namely, anointed ruler,--is most intensely national and, therefore,  intensely Semitic,--from which indisputable fact it follows that the  loftiest conception of religion came to the world from that source.  Thence came the Bible,--the book of the world which has been  translated into every living tongue and dialect, and to the  elucidation of which hosts of scholars still devote their lives.  Painting, sculpture, music, poetry, have attempted their highest  flights under its inspiration. From countless pulpits its moral and  religious truths are expounded, week after week, and on every great  occasion of national significance,--in whatever part of Christendom it  may occur,--the Songs of Zion are awakened as the fittest expressions  of the prevailing sentiment. The Psalter is the most wonderful of  existing books,--at home alike in the palace of the king and the  cottage of the peasant, the inexhaustible theme of our masters of  music. Noeldeke, Protestant professor at the University of Strasburg,  one of the great lights of Semitic scholarship, declares that \"by the  side of the Psalms all other religious hymns appear as pale imitations  merely.\" On that field were gathered the sheaves which a master hand  has wound together into the One Universal Prayer, in which all  Churches join with one accord. And the Universal Day of Rest,--that  one sure blessing of the laboring man,--whence did it come? What other  legislator had the divine audacity to make its observance one of the  foundation laws of his constitution, and to give it precedence, even  over all moral enactments?    Professor R.F. Grau of the conservative school of theology writes:--    \"God is a living, holy, loving Being. He is not first and foremost to  be scientifically comprehended, but worshipped and revered in the  heart, and because He is such a Being, the Semites had to be chosen as  His apostles to the whole world. For they had a heart for Him in the  beginning.... The Semite has the religion of the Infinite, and as this  is the perfect religion, ... the Church, as the Community of Christ,  has sprung from the Semitic mustard seed, although at present myriads  of Indo-germanics dwell under the branches of the tree.\"    In the face of admissions like these by men who have a right to be  heard in the matter, and considering that the tree can never change  the nature of the root from which it sprang, the conclusion is not  unwarranted that \"anti-Semitic\" is a synonym for \"anti-Christian.\"    Its success is due to the still persistent prejudice against the Jews  among so many Christians,--all their professions to the contrary  notwithstanding. And it continues for several reasons. One is its long  duration; it has lasted for ages and is ingrained in their feelings  and ideas. What if it be shown ever so clearly that it is unjust,  unreasonable, yea, even unchristian!--that will not materially change  the temper of the great masses of the people. The common man is rarely  swayed by the force of arguments; the power of a principle, so weighty  with the thinkers, is of no consequence to him. He belongs to the  material world, and to make good his place in it is the aim toward  which all his energies are bent. For things spiritual he has neither  time nor capacity. He is ruled by the sentiments which were implanted  in him in his youth and by his immediate surroundings. All thinking  must be done for him; all new ideas must be presented to him, as it  were, ready made and in tangible form. He does not push himself  forward, but must be led onward by hands that understand him and his  ways. But in this instance, his guides are not particularly anxious to  bring about a change for the better,--even if we suppose that they  consider the liberation from prejudice against the Jews a betterment.  They have their own theological difficulty to contend with. The Jews  are still unconverted, and the missions established and maintained for  the purpose of winning them over can show no better results now than  in the past. The chief controversy between the Church and Israel  stands to-day where it stood when it was first raised at Jerusalem  eighteen centuries ago. A judicial sentence of a court at Jerusalem  has grown into a pivotal point on which, as the Church declares, turns  the salvation of mankind for time and eternity; and if she is right,  the Jews must be wrong. Since that fatal occurrence, Christianity, in  one form or another, has conquered Europe and America, and has planted  outposts in almost every part of the earth, but has not been able to  subdue the Jew. Every conceivable means to make him surrender has been  tried, including that of the jailor and the executioner and all the  horrors that lie between them,--expulsion, pillage, social  degradation, impaling in ghettos, and what not--but in vain. The same  policy is continued to this day as far as the present more civilized  state of the Christians permits; but still in vain. So far are their  persecutors from having brought the Jews to their knees, that the  self-consciousness of the race, as a whole, has deepened; and their  advance in general culture enables them to measure swords,  intellectually, with their accusers and to give a reason for the faith  that is in them.    All the conditions of this interminable conflict are against them. In  numbers they are a vanishing minority, and still more weakened by  their dispersion over the face of the earth, unorganized, without any  ecclesiastical authority in their Church that could direct them or act  in their name. Every individual Jew must face the world's hostility  single-handed, and be, religiously, his own priest, his own pope.  Allies he has none, advocates of his cause are few and far between.  The favors of his friends are often more humiliating than the attacks  of his enemies. Still he holds his own, and if for the last century or  so he has carried on a reformation of his ancient rituals, he has done  so from his own initiative and in his own way, which is not that into  which it has been tried so long to force or to lure him. At the same  time a revival of Jewish literature has taken place which not only has  brought to light the long-forgotten treasures of the past, but has  shown the large part the Jews have in the general progress of mankind.  The ecclesia triumphant has no victory to record in this section of  her battlefields, and it is not in ordinary human nature frankly to  admit a defeat in such an unequal struggle. Only one had a right to  expect that a Church that claims to have regenerated the human race  and to have lifted the slave of his blind instincts into \"the glorious  liberty of the children of God\" would have risen superior to the  common weakness. Instead of that, almost throughout Christendom, the  crusade against the Jews is being preached and the policy of  repression loudly demanded.    On what ground? It is said that they dominate everywhere--in finance,  in law courts, in politics, in art, in literature, in the press, in  trade and manufacture. But how do they achieve this astounding feat?  How do the Jews succeed in so lording it over the immense majority? By  witchcraft? Is it by magic that a few bankers and brokers keep all  their competitors in subjugation and handle them at their will and to  their own profit? Is it by sorcery that they force their way to the  universities and academies? Are they in possession of secret formulas  by which they can direct the currents of trade at their will?  Recently, loud complaints were raised in several of the German state  parliaments that there were too many Jewish judges and lawyers in  their lands, and the governments were exhorted to put an end to the  scandal. No charges of incompetency or exploitation were raised  against the Hebrews that \"handle the law.\" Only it was declared that  a Christian shrunk from taking an oath at the hand of a Jewish lawyer.  If this be so, how is it that the people go to them in numbers that  excite the envy of their non-Jewish colleagues? All the statements"]]]
