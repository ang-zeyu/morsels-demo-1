While those  who are governed by the law of expediency should give the measure of  justice they deem safe, let those who trust the absolute right  proclaim the higher principle in government, \"equal rights to all.\"    Many seeming obstacles in the way of woman's enfranchisement will be  surmounted by reforms in many directions. Co-operative labor and  co-operative homes will remove many difficulties in the way of woman's  success as artisan and housekeeper, when admitted to the governing  power. The varied forms of progress, like parallel lines, move forward  simultaneously in the same direction. Each reform, at its inception,  seems out of joint with all its surroundings; but the discussion  changes the conditions, and brings them in line with the new idea.    The isolated household is responsible for a large share of woman's  ignorance and degradation. A mind always in contact with children and  servants, whose aspirations and ambitions rise no higher than the roof  that shelters it, is necessarily dwarfed in its proportions. The  advantages to the few whose fortunes enable them to make the isolated  household a more successful experiment, can not outweigh the  difficulties of the many who are wholly sacrificed to its  maintenance.    Quite as many false ideas prevail as to woman's true position in the  home as to her status elsewhere. Womanhood is the great fact in her  life; wifehood and motherhood are but incidental relations.  Governments legislate for men; we do not have one code for bachelors,  another for husbands and fathers; neither have the social relations of  women any significance in their demands for civil and political  rights. Custom and philosophy, in regard to woman's happiness, are  alike based on the idea that her strongest social sentiment is love of  children; that in this relation her soul finds complete satisfaction.  But the love of offspring, common to all orders of women and all forms  of animal life, tender and beautiful as it is, can not as a sentiment  rank with conjugal love. The one calls out only the negative virtues  that belong to apathetic classes, such as patience, endurance,  self-sacrifice, exhausting the brain-forces, ever giving, asking  nothing in return; the other, the outgrowth of the two supreme powers  in nature, the positive and negative magnetism, the centrifugal and  centripetal forces, the masculine and feminine elements, possessing  the divine power of creation, in the universe of thought and action.  Two pure souls fused into one by an impassioned love--friends,  counselors--a mutual support and inspiration to each other amid life's  struggles, must know the highest human happiness;--this is marriage;  and this is the only corner-stone of an enduring home. Neither does  ordinary motherhood, assumed without any high purpose or preparation,  compare in sentiment with the lofty ambition and conscientious  devotion of the artist whose pure children of the brain in poetry,  painting, music, and science are ever beckoning her upward into an  ideal world of beauty. They who give the world a true philosophy, a  grand poem, a beautiful painting or statue, or can tell the story of  every wandering star; a George Eliot, a Rosa Bonheur, an Elizabeth  Barrett Browning, a Maria Mitchell--whose blood has flowed to the  higher arches of the brain,--have lived to a holier purpose than they  whose children are of the flesh alone, into whose minds they have  breathed no clear perceptions of great principles, no moral  aspiration, no spiritual life.    Her rights are as completely ignored in what is adjudged to be woman's  sphere as out of it; the woman is uniformly sacrificed to the wife and  mother. Neither law, gospel, public sentiment, nor domestic affection  shield her from excessive and enforced maternity, depleting alike to  mother and child;--all opportunity for mental improvement, health,  happiness--yea, life itself, being ruthlessly sacrificed. The weazen,  weary, withered, narrow-minded wife-mother of half a dozen  children--her interests all centering at her fireside, forms a painful  contrast in many a household to the liberal, genial, brilliant,  cultured husband in the zenith of his power, who has never given one  thought to the higher life, liberty, and happiness of the woman by his  side; believing her self-abnegation to be Nature's law.    It is often asked, \"if political equality would not rouse antagonisms  between the sexes?\" If it could be proved that men and women had been  harmonious in all ages and countries, and that women were happy and  satisfied in their slavery, one might hesitate in proposing any change  whatever. But the apathy, the helpless, hopeless resignation of a  subjected class can not be called happiness. The more complete the  despotism, the more smoothly all things move on the surface. \"Order  reigns in Warsaw.\" In right conditions, the interests of man and woman  are essentially one; but in false conditions, they must ever be  opposed. The principle of equality of rights underlies all human  sentiments, and its assertion by any individual or class must rouse  antagonism, unless conceded. This has been the battle of the ages, and  will be until all forms of slavery are banished from the earth.  Philosophers, historians, poets, novelists, alike paint woman the  victim ever of man's power and selfishness. And now all writers on  Eastern civilization tell us, the one insurmountable obstacle to the  improvement of society in those countries, is the ignorance and  superstition of the women. Stronger than the trammels of custom and  law, is her religion, which teaches that her condition is  Heaven-ordained. As the most ignorant minds cling with the greatest  tenacity to the dogmas and traditions of their faith, a reform that  involves an attack on that stronghold can only be carried by the  education of another generation. Hence the self-assertion, the  antagonism, the rebellion of woman, so much deplored in England and  the United States, is the hope of our higher civilization. A woman  growing up under American ideas of liberty in government and religion,  having never blushed behind a Turkish mask, nor pressed her feet in  Chinese shoes, can not brook any disabilities based on sex alone,  without a deep feeling of antagonism with the power that creates it.  The change needed to restore good feeling can not be reached by  remanding woman to the spinning-wheel, and the contentment of her  grandmother, but by conceding to her every right which the spirit of  the age demands. Modern inventions have banished the spinning-wheel,  and the same law of progress makes the woman of to-day a different  woman from her grandmother.    With these brief replies to the oft-repeated objections made by the  opposition, we hope to rouse new thoughts in minds prepared to receive  them. That equal rights for woman have not long ago been secured, is  due to causes beyond the control of the actors in this reform. \"The  success of a movement,\" says Lecky, \"depends much less upon the force  of its arguments, or upon the ability of its advocates, than the  predisposition of society to receive it.\"          CHAPTER I.    PRECEDING CAUSES.      As civilization advances there is a continual change in the standard  of human rights. In barbarous ages the right of the strongest was the  only one recognized; but as mankind progressed in the arts and  sciences intellect began to triumph over brute force. Change is a law  of life, and the development of society a natural growth. Although to  this law we owe the discoveries of unknown worlds, the inventions of  machinery, swifter modes of travel, and clearer ideas as to the value  of human life and thought, yet each successive change has met with the  most determined opposition. Fortunately, progress is not the result of  pre-arranged plans of individuals, but is born of a fortuitous  combination of circumstances that compel certain results, overcoming  the natural inertia of mankind. There is a certain enjoyment in  habitual sluggishness; in rising each morning with the same ideas as  the night before; in retiring each night with the thoughts of the  morning. This inertia of mind and body has ever held the multitude in  chains. Thousands have thus surrendered their most sacred rights of  conscience. In all periods of human development, thinking has been  punished as a crime, which is reason sufficient to account for the  general passive resignation of the masses to their conditions and  environments.    Again, \"subjection to the powers that be\" has been the lesson of both  Church and State, throttling science, checking invention, crushing  free thought, persecuting and torturing those who have dared to speak  or act outside of established authority. Anathemas and the stake have  upheld the Church, banishment and the scaffold the throne, and the  freedom of mankind has ever been sacrificed to the idea of protection.  So entirely has the human will been enslaved in all classes of society  in the past, that monarchs have humbled themselves to popes, nations  have knelt at the feet of monarchs, and individuals have sold  themselves to others under the subtle promise of \"protection\"--a word  that simply means release from all responsibility, all use of one's  own faculties--a word that has ever blinded people to its true  significance. Under authority and this false promise of \"protection,\"  self-reliance, the first incentive to freedom, has not only been lost,  but the aversion of mankind for responsibility has been fostered by  the few, whose greater bodily strength, superior intellect, or the  inherent law of self-development has impelled to active exertion.  Obedience and self-sacrifice--the virtues prescribed for subordinate  classes, and which naturally grow out of their condition--are alike  opposed to the theory of individual rights and self-government. But as  even the inertia of mankind is not proof"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#5)"],[1,"muscle-building,  tone-cultivating, speed-making lines of technic in order to make up for  the lack of the training which the young lady might easily have had at  home had her parents been schooled to systematic daily study as a  necessity. Her first technical exercises with the new teacher are so  simple that the young woman is on the verge of despair until she  realizes that her playing is really taking on a new and more mature  character. She has been lifting fifty pound weights occasionally. Her  teacher is training her to lift one hundred pound weights every day. She  has been sketching in pastels,--her teacher is now teaching her how to  make Velasquez-like strokes in oils. Her gain is not a mere matter of  loudness. She could play quite as loud before she went to Europe. There  is something mature in this new style of playing, something that  resembles the playing of the other virtuosos she has heard. Who is the  great European master who is working such great wonders for her? None  other than a celebrated teacher who taught for years in America,--a  master no better than dozens of others in America right now. Can the  teachers in America be blamed if the parents and the pupils fail to make  as serious and continued an effort here? Atmosphere,--bosh! Work, long,  hard and unrelenting,--that is the salvation of the student who would  become a virtuoso. With our increasing wealth and advancing culture  American parents are beginning to discover that given the same work and  the same amount of instruction musical education in America differs very  slightly from musical education abroad.    But we are deserting our young virtuoso most ungallantly. In Berlin she  hears so many concerts and recitals, so many different styles of  playing, that she begins to think for herself and her sense of artistic  discrimination--interpretation, if you will--becomes more and more  acute. Provided with funds for attending concerts, she does regularly,  whereas in America she neglected opportunities equally good. She never  realized before that there could be so much to a Brahms _Intermezzo_ or  a Chopin _Ballade_. At the end of her first year her American  common-sense tells her that a plunge into the concert field is still  dangerous. Accordingly she remains two, or possibly three, more years  and at the end if she has worked hard she is convinced that with proper  management she may stand some chance of winning that fickle treasure,  public favor.    \"But,\" persists the reader, \"it would have been possible for her to have  accomplished the same work at home in America.\" Most certainly, if she  had had any one of the hundred or more virtuoso teachers now resident in  the United States all of whom are capable of bringing a highly talented  pupil to virtuoso heights,--and if in their teaching they had exerted  sufficient will-power to demand from the pupil and the pupil's parents  the same conditions which would govern the work of the same pupil  studying in Europe. Through long tradition and by means of endless  experiences the conditions have been established in Europe. The student  who aspires to become a professional is given a distinctively  professional course. In America the need for such a training is but  scantily appreciated. Only a very few of us are able to appraise the  real importance of music in the advancement of human civilization, nor  is this unusual, since most of us have but to go back but a very few  generations to encounter our blessed Puritan and Quaker ancestors to  whom all music, barring the lugubrious Psalm singing, was the  inspiration of the devil. The teachers, as has been said before, are  fully ready and more than anxious to give the kind of training required.  Very frequently parents are themselves to blame for the slender  _dilettante_ style of playing which their well-instructed children  present. They measure the needs of the concert hall by the dimensions of  the parlor. The teacher of the would-be professional pupil aspires to  produce a quantity of tone that will fill an auditorium seating at least  one thousand people. The pupil at home is enjoined not to \"bang\" or  \"pound.\" The result is a feeble, characterless tone which rarely fills  an auditorium as it should. The actor can not forever rehearse in  whispers if he is to fill a huge theater, and the concert pianist must  have a strong, sure, resilient touch in order to bring about climaxes  and make the range of his dynamic power all-comprehensive. Indeed, the  separation from home ties, or shall we call them home interferences, is  often more responsible for the results achieved abroad than superior  instruction.    Unfortunately, the number of virtuosos who have been taught exclusively  in America is really very small. It is not a question of ability upon  the part of the teacher or talent upon the part of the pupil. It is  entirely a matter of the attitudes of the teacher, the pupil and the  pupil's home advisers. Success demands strong-willed discipline and the  most lofty standards imaginable. Teachers who have taught for years in  America have returned to Europe, doubled and quadrupled their fees, and,  under old-world surroundings and with more rigid standards of artistic  work, have produced results they declare would have been impossible in  America. The author contends that these results would have been readily  forthcoming if we in America assumed the same earnest, persistent  attitude toward the work itself. If these words do no more than reach  the eyes of some of those who are advising students wrongly in this  matter they will not have been written in vain. The European concert  triumphs of Mrs. H. H. A. Beach, whose training was received wholly in  the United States, is an indication of what may be achieved in America  if the right course is pursued. Conditions are changing rapidly in our  country, particularly in the wonderful West and Middle-West. It seems  likely that many pianists without foreign instruction of any kind will  have as great success in our concert field as have many of our best  opera singers who have never had a lesson \"on the other side.\"    Our little pianist has again been playing truant from our manuscript.  Let us see what happens to her when she finished her work with the  famous teacher abroad. Surely the making of a virtuoso is an expensive  matter. Let us take the estimate of the young pianist's father, who  practically mortgaged his financial existence to give his daughter the  right musical training.

Eighty lessons a year for four years              $240.00        Lessons with second American teacher for two         years at $2.00 a lesson                             320.00        Lessons with third American teacher at $4.00 a          lesson for one year and six months                 480.00        Music, books, etc.                                     160.00        Piano                                                  750.00        Maintenance for eight years at $200.00 a year          (minimum estimate)                                1600.00        Four years in Europe, travel, board, instruction,          advertising, etc.                                 6000.00                                                           ________              TOTAL                                        $9550.00    But the expense has only begun, if you please. The harvest is still a  long way off. According to the fine traditions established by the late  P. T. Barnum, there must be a European furore to precede the American  advent of the musical star. The journalistic astronomers must point  their telescopes long and steadily at the European firmament and  proclaim their discovery in the columns of their papers. Again, furores  are expensive. One must hire an auditorium, hire an orchestra, and,  according to some very frank and disgusted young virtuosos who have  failed to succeed, hire a critic or so like the amusing Trotter in  _Fanny's First Play_. What with three and four concerts a night why  should not the critics have a _pourboire_ for extra critical attention?  Fortunately the best papers hold their criticisms above price. Bought  criticisms are very rare, and if the young pianist or any representative  approaches certain critics with any such suggestion, she may count upon  faring very badly in cold type on the following day.    If Miss Virtuoso makes a success, her press notices are sent to her  American concert managers, who purchase space in some American musical  newspapers and reprint these notices. Publicity of this kind is  legitimate, as the American public knows that in most cases these press  notices are reprinted solely as advertising. It is simply the commercial  process of \"acquainting the trade\" and if done right may prove one of  the most fortunate investments for the young artist. Do not imagine,  however, that the pianist's American manager speculates in the  problematical success of the coming virtuoso. On the contrary, his fee  for putting the artist on his \"list\" and promoting her interests may  range from five hundred dollars to two thousand dollars in advance.  After that the manager usually requires a commission on all engagements  \"booked.\" Graft? Spoils? Plunder? Not a bit of it. If the manager is a  good one--that is, if he is an upright business man well schooled in his  work--the investment should prove a good one. Exploiting a new artist  is a matter demanding brains, energy, ingenuity and experience. A  manufacturing firm attempting to put some new product upon an already  crowded market would spend not $2000.00 a year in advertising, but  $100,000.00. The manager must maintain an organization, he must travel,  he must advertise and he too must live. If he succeeds in marketing the  services of the young virtuoso at one or two hundred dollars a concert,  the returns soon begin to overtake the"]]]
