Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial waste  which are released into the environment, subsequently polluting it.    Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.    Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.    Greenhouse gas - a gas that \"traps\" infrared radiation in the lower  atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the primary  greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.    Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth often  in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata; the source  for wells and natural springs.    Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most costly  and controversial; objections to the project include claims that it  forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and squanders  economic resources.    Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the 145,000 Inuits of  Russia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland in international environmental  issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years to determine the  focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are long-range transport of  pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.    Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.    Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.    Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it  can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.    Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.    Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with  respect to endangered or threatened species.    Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.    Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.    Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes  salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process;  also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.    Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.    Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which  trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary  agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which  point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is  sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for  regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do  not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the  environment.    Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of  poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or  fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of  topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.    Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,  and desertification.    Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy  emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by  the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and  has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.    Waterborne diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are  transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.    Environment - international agreements:  This entry separates country  participation in international environmental agreements into two levels  - party to and signed, but not ratified. Agreements are listed in  alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.    Environmental agreements:  This information is presented in Appendix C:  Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the  name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into force,  objective, and parties by category.    Ethnic groups:  This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups  starting with the largest and normally includes the percent of total  population.    Exchange rates:  This entry provides the official value of a country's  monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as  expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined by  international market forces or official fiat. The International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4217 alphabetic currency code  for the national medium of exchange is presented in parenthesis.    Executive branch:  This entry includes several subfields. Chief of  state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country  who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may  not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head  of government includes the name and title of the top administrative  leader who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the  government. For example, in the UK, the monarch is the chief of state,  and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, the  president is both the chief of state and the head of government.  Cabinet includes the official name for this body of high-ranking  advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections include the  nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last  election, and date of the next election. Election results includes the  percent of vote for each candidate in the last election.    Exports:  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise  exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Exports - commodities:  This entry provides a listing of the highest-  valued exported products; it sometimes includes the percent of total  dollar value.    Exports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading  partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the  percent of total dollar value.    Flag description:  This entry provides a written flag description  produced from actual flags or the best information available at the  time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used by  their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag.  Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic:  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at  the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced  from actual flags or the best information available at the time of  preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their  dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some  disputed and other areas do not have flags.    Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):  This entry  provides the annual quantity of water in cubic kilometers removed from  available sources for use in any purpose. Water drawn-off is not  necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for  further use downstream. Domestic sector use refers to water supplied by  public distribution systems. Note that some of this total may be used  for small industrial and/or limited agricultural purposes. Industrial  sector use is the quantity of water used by self-supplied industries  not connected to a public distribution system. Agricultural sector use  includes water used for irrigation and livestock watering, and does not  account for agriculture directly dependent on rainfall. Included are  figures for total annual water withdrawal and per capita water  withdrawal.    GDP (official exchange rate):  This entry gives the gross domestic  product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within  a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at official exchange rates  (OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the  bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The  measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value  of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the  economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors, judging  that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in  the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be  artificially fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims  of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not  necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate.  Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined,  market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small  set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29246"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 2, May, 1851 (#5)"],[1,"the servants of a tenant  carefully washed all out.\"    We can easily imagine how the union between Hogarth and his daughter,  commenced after such a fashion, outraged not only the courtliness, but  the higher and better feelings of Sir James Thornhill. Hogarth's innate  consciousness of power may at that time have appeared to him vulgar  effrontery; and it is not to be wondered at, that, until convinced of  his talent, he refused him all assistance. There is something so false  and wrong in the concealment that precedes an elopement, and the  elopement of an only child from an aged father, that we marvel how any  one can treat lightly the outraged feelings of a confiding parent.  Earnest tender love so deeply rooted in a father's heart may pardon, but  cannot reach forgetfulness as quickly as it is the custom of  play-writers and novelists to tell us it may do.    Sir James Thornhill was greatly the fashion; he was the successor of  Verrio, and the rival of La Guerre, in the decorations of our palaces  and public buildings. His demands for the painting of Greenwich Hall  were contested; and though La Fosse received two thousand pounds for his  works at Montague House, besides other allowances, Sir James, despite  his dignity as Member of Parliament for his native town of Weymouth,  could obtain but forty shillings a square yard for painting the cupola  of St. Paul's! Thus the patronage afforded \"native talent\" kept him  poor; and though it must have been necessary (one of the cruel  necessities induced by love of display in England), to have an  establishment suited to his public position in London, nothing could be  more unpretending than his _menage_ at Chiswick. Mrs. Hogarth, advised  by her mother, skilfully managed to let her father see one of her  husband's best productions under advantageous circumstances. Sir James  acknowledged its merit at once, exclaiming, \"Very well! very well! The  man who can make works like this can maintain a wife without a portion;\"  and soon after became not only reconciled, but generous to the young  people. Hogarth had tasted the bitterness of labor; he had even worked  for booksellers, and painted portraits!--so that this summer brightness  must have been full of enjoyment. He appreciated it thoroughly, and was  ever the earnest admirer and the ready defender of Sir James Thornhill;  thus the old knight secured a friend in his son; and it was pleasanter  to think of the hours of reconciliation and happiness they might have  passed within the walls of that inclosed garden, beneath the crumbling  trellice, or the shadow of the old mulberry tree, than of the  fortuneless artist wooing the confiding daughter from her home and her  filial duties.    [Illustration: HOGARTH'S PAINTING-ROOM.]    We were invited to inspect Hogarth's painting-room--a mere loft, of most  limited dimensions, over the stable, which the imagination could easily  furnish with the necessary easel, or still less cumbrous graver's  implements. It is situated at the furthest part of the garden from the  house; a small door in the garden-wall leads into a little inclosure,  one side of which is occupied by the stable. The painting-room is over  the stable, and is reached by a stair; it has but one window which looks  towards the road. It must have been sufficiently commodious for  Hogarth's purposes; but possesses not the conveniences of modern  painting-rooms. The house at Chiswick could only have been a place for  recreation and repose, where relaxation was cared for, and where  sketches were prepared to ripen into publication.    There are traditions about Chiswick of Hogarth having, while studying  and taking notes, frequented a little inn by the roadside, and almost  within sight of his dwelling. It has been modernized throughout--and  supplies no subject for the pencil--yet it retains some indications, not  without interest, of a remote date. The Painter must have been familiar  with every class of character; and Chiswick was then enough of a country  village to supply him amply with material. But, although a keen  satirist, it is certain that he had as much tenderness for the lower  orders of creation, as a young loving girl. In a corner of this quaint  old garden, two tiny monuments are affixed to the wall, one chiselled  perhaps by Hogarth's own hand, to the memory of his canary bird! The  _thinking_ character of the painter's mind is evidenced in this as in  every thing he did--the engraving on the tomb suggesting reflection.  Charles Lamb said of him truly, that the quantity of _thought_ which he  crowded into every picture, would alone \"_unvulgarize_\" every subject he  might choose; and the refined Coleridge exclaims, \"Hogarth! in whom the  satirist never extinguished that love of beauty which belonged to him as  a poet.\" There is something inexpressibly tender and touching in this  memento of his affection for a little singing bird: the feeling must  have been entirely his own, for he had no child to suggest the tribute  to a feathered favorite. The tomb was afterwards accompanied with one to  Mrs. Hogarth's dog. They are narrow, upright pieces of white stone laid  against the brick-wall, but they are records of gentle and generous  sympathies not to be overlooked. That Hogarth was more than on friendly  terms with the canine race, the introduction of his own dog into his  portrait clearly tells, and doubtless his bird often brought with its  music visions of the country into the heat and dust of Leicester  Square--soothing away much of his impatience. Men who have to fight the  up-hill battle of life, must have energy and determination; and Hogarth  was too out-spoken and self-confident not to have made many enemies. In  after years his success (limited though it was, in a pecuniary point of  view, for he died without leaving enough to support his widow  respectably), produced its ordinary results--envy and enmity: and  insults were heaped upon him. He was not tardy of reply, but Wilkes and  Churchill were in strong health when nature was giving way with the  great painter; an advantage they did not fail to use with their  accustomed malignity. The profligate Churchill, turning the poet's  nature into gall, infested the death-bed of Hogarth with unfeeling  sarcasm, anticipating the grave, and exulting over a dying man.    [Illustration: TOMBS OF DOG AND BIRD.]    Hogarth, warned by the autumn winds, and suffering from the restlessness  of approaching dissolution, left Chiswick on the 25th of October, 1764,  and returned to his residence in Leicester Square. He was cheerful--in  full possession of his mental faculties, but lacked the vigor to exert  them. The very next day, having received an agreeable letter from Doctor  Franklin, he wrote a rough copy of his answer, but exhausted with the  effort, retired to bed. Seized by a sudden sickness, he arose--rung the  bell with alarming violence--and within two hours expired!    Of all the villages in the neighborhood of London, rising from the banks  of the Thames, (and how numerous and beautiful they are!) few are so  well known as that of Chiswick. The horticultural fetes are anticipated  with anxiety similar to that our grandmothers felt for the fetes of  Ranelagh; the _toilettes_ of the ladies rival the flowers, and the only  foe to the fascinating fair ones is the weather; but all which the crowd  care about in Chiswick is confined to the \"Duke's grounds\" and the  Society's Gardens. The Duke's beautiful little villa, erected by the  last Earl of Burlington, is indeed a shrine worthy of deep homage;  within its walls both Charles James Fox and George Canning breathed  their last; and if, for a moment, we recall the times of Civil War, when  each honest English heart fought bravely and openly for what was  believed \"the right,\" we may picture the struggle between Prince Rupert  and the Earl of Essex, terminating with doubtful success, for eight  hundred high born cavaliers were left dead on the plain that lies within  sight of the gardens so richly perfumed by flowers, and echoing not to  the searching trumpet or rolling drum, but to the gossamer music of  Strauss and Jullien.    The Duke of Devonshire's grounds, containing about ninety acres, are  filled with mementos, pleasant to the eye and suggestive to the  imagination; but we must seek and find a more solemn scene, where the  churchyard of Chiswick incloses the ashes of some whose names are  written upon the pages of History. Though the church is, in a degree,  surrounded by houses, there is much of the repose of \"a country  churchyard\" about it; the Thames belts it with its silver girdle, and  when we visited its sanctuary, the setting sun cast a mellow light upon  the windows of the church, touching a headstone or an urn, while the  shadows trembled on the undulating graves. Like all church-yards it is  crowded, and however reverently we bent our footsteps, it was impossible  to avoid treading on the soft grass of the humble grave, or the gray  stone that marks the resting-place of one of \"the better order.\"    [Illustration: HOGARTH'S TOMB.]    How like the world was that silent churchyard! High and low, rich and  poor, mingled together, and yet avoiding to mingle. The dust of the  imperious Duchess of Cleveland found here a grave; while here too, as if  to contrast the pure with the impure, repose the ashes of Mary, daughter  of Oliver Cromwell; Holland the actor, the friend of David Garrick, here  cast aside his \"motley.\" Can we wonder at the actor's love of  applause?--posterity knows him not; present fame alone is his--the  lark's song leaves no record in the air!--Lord Macartney, the famous  ambassador to China, a country of which our knowledge was then almost as  dim as that we have of the moon--the ambassador rests here, while a  Chinese junk is absolutely moored in the very river that murmurs beside  his grave! Surely the old place is worthy of a pilgrimage. Loutherbourg, "]]]
