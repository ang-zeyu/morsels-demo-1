To  others, the work of mining may possess its strong attraction, since this  work takes its followers into strange places and among strange people  frequently, where oftentimes the mining engineer must live cheek by  elbow with the roughest of adventurers. To yet a third group, civil  engineering, with its work of blazing new trails through an unknown  country, and wild outdoor existence through forests and over mountains  and across valleys--may have its strong attraction. While to a fourth  group of prospective students the quiet career, as represented in that  of mechanical engineering, always a more or less thoughtful, studious  life, may hold out its inviting side. The mechanical engineer, like the  electrical engineer, is a man who generally commutes, a man who comes  and goes daily between office and home, doing his work at regular hours  within the four walls of his office--a quiet, professional man. Such a  life would appeal to the man of family rather more strongly than either  of the outdoor professional branches. Yet the prospective student must  make his own choice.    To the young man who has no particular preference, and who would put it  up to the writer as to just which branch to follow--the young man more  or less in need--the writer unhesitatingly would advise mechanical  engineering. It is the one branch offering the largest and quickest  returns, and as a branch it fairly dominates all the other branches, for  the reason that whereas the mechanical engineer can get along without  the mining engineer or the civil engineer or the electrical engineer,  neither the mining engineer nor the civil engineer nor the electrical  engineer can always do without the services of the mechanical engineer.  No other branch so overlaps the other branches as does mechanical  engineering. The work of the mechanical engineer is seen in almost every  piece of construction reared by the civil man, just as it is seen in  every bit of construction work of the mining and the electrical  engineers. At first glance this may not appear to be true, but a close  analysis of different jobs will bring out the truth of this statement.    Thus mechanical engineering offers largest and quickest returns. It does  this for another reason. Because of this very overlapping upon the  other three branches, for every position open in the electrical field,  or the mining or the civil field, there are a dozen vacancies in the  mechanical field. It cannot but be otherwise. Not one of the other  branches but what has need at times for--as I have stated--a mechanical  engineer. The casings and base-plates and supports of motors, for  instance, while the motor itself--its windings and the like--is the work  of the electrical engineer, are due to the designing genius of some  mechanical man. Likewise, in the mining field, where shaking screens, to  name only one of the many mechanical units necessary in mining  operations, are an essential factor--units operated with pulleys and  belts and cams and levers--all the province of the mechanical  engineer--the mechanical man finds his uses. So in civil work,  especially in dam construction where gates are necessary; and in  chemical engineering--to drop into a minor branch--where tanks and vats  and ovens and stirring paddles and the like are used. No matter in which  branch a man may go, always he will find evidence of the presence some  time of the mechanical engineer. The mechanical engineer dominates all  the other branches, as has been said before. He is given second place  in the order of the branches merely because the civil engineer happened  to be the first and oldest kind of engineer to be given recognition as a  profession. This man made himself a professional man, just as did the  early practitioners of medicine--concocters of herbs in the beginning.    The proper selection will depend upon the young man's predilections and  tastes. If he selects wisely, following out his predilections and tastes  with a degree of accuracy, he cannot go wrong. He cannot go far wrong  even if he doesn't follow out his hunches, for the reason that he can  always swing over into any one of the other branches whenever he sees  fit to do so. The thing is done every day, and will continue to be done  throughout all time. Merely, it would be well for the young man, of  course, to select in the beginning that branch which most appeals to  him, and to stick to it like glue. Success is certain to be his. For in  no other walk of life are the rewards so sure and so ample and so  immediately responsive as in the engineering professions. These--like  the matter of his selection from among the four major branches--are  solely a matter up to the individual.          VI    QUALIFYING FOR PROMOTION      Immediately upon graduating--indeed, often several months before  graduating--the engineering student finds his first job awaiting him.  Frequently he finds a number of first jobs awaiting him and must make a  selection. For it is the custom with large manufacturing concerns to  send out scouts in the early spring of each year to address the  engineering student bodies, with the idea in mind of securing the  services of as many graduates as the scouts can win over for their  respective organizations through direct appeal. What is usually offered  the coming graduate is a brief apprenticeship in the shop, at a living  wage, with promise of as early and rapid promotion in the organization  as the work of the apprentice himself will permit, or improves.    These offers are generally splendid opportunities. The graduate may  learn much of a practical commercial nature which perforce has been  denied him in his student days, and also, having entered upon this  apprenticeship, he not only gets acquainted with production on a large  scale, but he is brought into touch with what constitutes most recent  acceptable practice as well. This, provided he be a mechanical or an  electrical engineer. Graduates in civil and mining engineering, while  offered positions from executives in these particular branches also,  have no such large opportunities offered them. The work itself does not  permit it. Yet in any of the branches there is never a scarcity of jobs  open to graduates upon their leaving college.    To qualify for promotion in any work, but more especially in the  professions, one must know one's business. That is a trite statement,  but it will bear repeating. The young graduate at first will not know  his business. His mind will be a chaos of theories based upon myriads of  formulae which cannot but confuse him in the early days, when he is most  earnestly trying to apply one or more of them to the more or less petty  tasks which will be assigned to him. All he can do under the  circumstances--all anybody could do under the circumstances--is to wait  patiently, the while doing the best he can. Problems have a way of  working themselves out--the correct formula will present itself; its  true application will become manifest--and thus the young engineer has  learned something of a practical nature which need not forsake him  throughout the remainder of his engineering career.    Engineers are especially tolerant of one another's mistakes and errors.  They are much more so than medical men, for instance. In the field of  medicine one must show by many practical cases wherein a certain  treatment has proved effective before the fraternity at large will even  give the practitioner a hearing. This is not so among engineers.  Engineers turn to one another in difficulties with earnest desire to  help if they can help; and when one of their number is in trouble in his  efforts to solve a difficult problem the whole body will turn to him  with friendly encouragement and advice, if the latter is wanted. The  young graduate who is struggling with a problem come up in his daily  work, if he will but make the fact known to the engineers on the job in  association with him, will find himself surrounded by engineers every  one of whom will be seriously concerned for him and anxious to render  assistance.    So the young graduate need entertain no fears on the ground of possible  errors when starting out. Merely he must go slow; take his own good  time on a job; ask all the questions possible of his engineer neighbors.  Frankness in engineering, as in any other walk of life, pays. The  bluffer is not wanted. No man knows it all, and certainly no engineer  knows all there is to know about his profession. Time was when this  might have been true; but it isn't true to-day. The work of engineering  research and development has become so complex that engineers are forced  to specialize. The engineering graduate, entering upon his first job,  will discover early that he, too, must specialize. This will not be  difficult, owing to the fact that his engineering education has been  general and designed to embrace in a liberal way all practice. Drawing,  as he will, from this liberal source that which he finds necessary in  the solving of his initial problems, he will find himself within a short  time becoming, willy-nilly, a specialist.    In the earlier years there should be considerable study done after hours  on the part of the graduate engineer. Because his education has been  general in the field, and he now holds a position with a company  manufacturing steam-turbines, say, he must \"wise up,\" as the saying  goes, on the subject of steam-turbines. It will do him no harm to trace  back to its source all progress made in the field of turbine engineering  and construction. He will find no scarcity of books on the subject, and  with every hour spent with these volumes he will become more valuable to  the organization employing him. Likewise, if he find himself working for  an electrical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#5)"],[1," dwarf is leading. After gallant adventures on the Queen's  behalf, her indignant resentment of his unknightly conduct,  estrangement, and rumours of death, he is at length restored to her  favour.[6] While _Perceval_ was still unfinished, Chretien de Troyes  died. It was continued by other poets, and through this romance the  quest of the holy graal became a portion of the Arthurian cycle. A  _Perceval_ by ROBERT DE BORON, who wrote in the early part of the  thirteenth century, has been lost; but a prose redaction of the  romance exists, which closes with the death of King Arthur. The great  _Lancelot_ in prose--a vast compilation--(about 1220) reduces the  various adventures of its hero and of other knights of the King to  their definitive form; and here the achievement of the graal is  assigned, not to Perceval, but to the saintly knight Sir Galaad;  Arthur is slain in combat with the revolter Mordret; and Lancelot  and the Queen enter into the life of religion. Passion and piety are  alike celebrated; the rude Celtic legends have been sanctified. The  earlier history of the sacred vase was traced by Robert de Boron in  his _Joseph d'Arimathie_ (or the _Saint-Graal_), soon to be rehandled  and developed in prose; and he it was who, in his _Merlin_--also  presently converted into prose--on suggestions derived from Geoffrey  of Monmouth, brought the great enchanter into Arthurian romance. By  the middle of the thirteenth century the cycle had received its full  development. Towards the middle of the fourteenth century, in  _Perceforest_, an attempt was made to connect the legend of Alexander  the Great with that of King Arthur.    [Footnote 6: Chretien de Troyes is the first poet to tell of the love  of Lancelot for the Queen.]    Beside the so-called Breton romances, the _Epopee courtoise_ may be  taken to include many poems of Greek, of Byzantine, or of uncertain  origin, such as the _Roman de la Violette_, the tale of a wronged  wife, having much in common with that novel of Boccaccio with which  Shakespeare's _Cymbeline_ is connected, the _Floire et  Blanchefleur_; the _Partenopeus de Blois_, a kind of \"Cupid and  Psyche\" story, with the parts of the lovers transposed, and others.  In the early years of the thirteenth century the prose romance  rivalled in popularity the romance in verse. The exquisite  _chante-fable_ of _Aucassin et Nicolette_, of the twelfth century,  is partly in prose, partly in assonanced _laisses_ of seven-syllable  verse. It is a story of the victory of love: the heir of Count Garin  of Beaucaire is enamoured of a beautiful maiden of unknown birth,  purchased from the Saracens, who proves to be daughter of the King  of Carthage, and in the end the lovers are united. In one remarkable  passage unusual sympathy is shown with the hard lot of the peasant,  whose trials and sufferings are contrasted with the lighter troubles  of the aristocratic class.    In general the poems of the _Epopee courtoise_ exhibit much of the  brilliant external aspect of the life of chivalry as idealised by  the imagination; dramatic situations are ingeniously devised; the  emotions of the chief actors are expounded and analysed, sometimes  with real delicacy; but in the conception of character, in the  recurring incidents, in the types of passion, in the creation of  marvel and surprise, a large conventional element is present. Love  is independent of marriage, or rather the relation of wedlock excludes  love in the accepted sense of the word; the passion is almost  necessarily illegitimate, and it comes as if it were an irresistible  fate; the first advance is often made by the woman; but, though at  war with the duty of wedlock, love is conceived as an ennobling  influence, prompting the knight to all deeds of courage and  self-sacrifice. Through the later translation of the Spanish _Amadis  des Gaules_, something of the spirit of the mediaeval romances was  carried into the chivalric and pastoral romances of the seventeenth  century.          CHAPTER II  LYRICAL POETRY--FABLES, AND RENARD THE FOX--FABLIAUX--THE ROMANCE  OF THE ROSE      I  LYRICAL POETRY    Long before the date of any lyrical poems that have come down to us,  song and dance were a part of the life of the people of the North  as well as of the South of France; religious festivals were celebrated  with a gaiety which had its mundane side; love and malicious sport  demanded an expression as well as pious joy. But in tracing the forms  of lyrical verse anterior to the middle of the twelfth century, when  the troubadour influence from the South began to be felt, we must  be guided partly by conjecture, derived from the later poetry, in  which--and especially in the refrains--earlier fragments have been  preserved.    The common characteristic which distinguishes the earlier lyrics is  the presence in them of an objective element: they do not merely render  an emotion; they contain something of a story, or they suggest a  situation. In this literature of sentiment, the singer or imagined  singer is commonly a woman. The _chanson d'histoire_ is also known  as _chanson de toile_, for the songs were such as suited \"the spinsters  and the knitters in the sun.\" Their inspiring motive was a girl's  joy or grief in love; they lightly outline or suggest the facts of  a miniature drama of passion, and are aided by the repeated lyrical  cry of a refrain. As yet, love was an affair for the woman; it was  she alone who made a confession of the heart. None of these poems  are later than the close of the twelfth century. If the author be  represented as actor or witness, the poem is rather a _chanson a  personnages_ than a _chanson d'histoire_; most frequently it is a  wife who is supposed to utter to husband, or lover, or to the poet,  her complaint of the grievous servitude of marriage. The _aube_ is,  again, a woman's song, uttered as a parting cry when the lark at  daybreak, or the watcher from his tower, warns her lover to depart.  In the _pastourelle_--a form much cultivated--a knight and a  shepherdess meet; love proposals are made, and find a response  favourable or the reverse; witnesses or companions may be present,  and take a part in the action. The _rondet_ is a dancing-song, in  which the refrain corresponds with one of the movements of the dance;  a solo-singer is answered by the response of a chorus; in the progress  of time the _rondet_ assumed the precise form of the modern triolet;  the theme was still love, at first treated seriously if not tragically,  but at a later time in a spirit of gaiety. It is conjectured that  all these lyrical forms had their origin in the festivities of May,  when the return of spring was celebrated by dances in which women  alone took part, a survival from the pagan rites of Venus.    The _poesie courtoise_, moulded in form and inspired in its sentiment  by the Provencal lyrics, lies within the compass of about one hundred  and thirty years, from 1150 to 1280. The Crusade of 1147 served,  doubtless, as a point of meeting for men of the North and of the South;  but, apart from this, we may bear in mind the fact that the mediaeval  poet wandered at will from country to country and from court to court.  In 1137, Louis VII. married Eleonore of Aquitaine, who was an ardent  admirer of the poetry of courtesy. Her daughters inherited her taste,  and themselves became patronesses of literature at the courts of their  husbands, Henri de Champagne and Thibaut de Blois. From these courts,  and that of Paris, this poetry of culture spread, and the earlier  singers were persons of royal or noble rank and birth. The chief period  of its cultivation was probably from 1200 to 1240. During the  half-century before its sudden cessation, while continuing to be a  fashion in courts and high society, it reached the wealthy bourgeoisie  of the North. At Arras, where Jacques Bretel and Adam de la Halle,  the hunchback, were eminent in song, it had its latest moments of  splendour.    It is essentially a poetry of the intellect and of the imagination,  dealing with an elaborated theory of love; the simple and spontaneous  cry of passion is rarely heard. According to the amorous doctrine,  love exists only between a married woman and the aspirant to her heart,  and the art of love is regulated by a stringent code. Nothing can  be claimed by the lover as a right; the grace of his lady, who is  placed far above him, must be sought as a favour; for that favour  he must qualify himself by all knightly virtues, and chief among these,  as the position requires, are the virtues of discretion and patience.  Hence the poet's ingenuities of adoration; hence often the monotony  of artificial passion; hence, also, subtleties and curiosities of  expression, and sought-out delicacies of style. In the earlier  chansons some outbreak of instinctive feeling may be occasionally  present; but, as the amorous metaphysics developed, what came to be  admired was the skill shown in manipulating a conventional sentiment;  the lady became an abstraction of exalted beauty, the lover an  interpreter of the theory of love; the most personal of passions lost  the character of individuality. Occasionally, as in the poems of the  Chatelain de Couci, of Conon de Bethune, of Thibaut de Champagne,  and of Adam de la Halle, something personal to the writer may be  discerned; but in general the poetry is that of a doctrine and of  a school.    In some instances the reputation of the lyrical trouvere was founded  rather on his music than his verse. The metrical forms were various,  and were gradually reduced to rule; the _ballette_, of Provencal  origin, was a more elaborate _rondet_, consisting of stanzas and  refrain; the _estampie_ (_stampon_, to beat the ground with the foot)  was a dancing-song; the lyric _lai_, virtually identical with the  _descort_, consisted of stanzas which varied in structure; the  _motet_, a name originally applied to pieces of church"]]]
