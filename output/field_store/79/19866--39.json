[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#5)"],[1," son, in the play, \"you musn't  complain if others become untrue to you.\" It was like a fresh wind  blowing suddenly through the choking atmosphere of a lightless room.  It was a new attitude: decent pride!    It called for a frightful effort to descend from the intoxicating  heights of creativity to the ordinary round of work. For weeks now his  regular employment had filled Herzl with revulsion. The first reports  of the Dreyfus trial, which appeared while he was working on his _New  Ghetto_, therefore made no particular impression on him. It looked  like a sordid espionage affair in which a foreign power--before long  it was revealed that the foreign power was Germany, acting through  Major von Schwartzkoppen--had been buying up through its agent secret  documents of the French general staff. An officer by the name of  Alfred Dreyfus was named as the culprit, and no one had reason to  doubt that he was guilty, even though Drumont's _Libre Parole_ was  exploiting the fact that the man was a Jew.    But, after the degradation of Dreyfus, Herzl became more and more  convinced of his innocence. \"A Jew who, as an officer on the general  staff, has before him an honorable career, cannot commit such a  crime.... The Jews, who have so long been condemned to a state of  civic dishonor, have, as a result, developed an almost pathological  hunger for honor, and a Jewish officer is in this respect specifically  Jewish.\"    \"The Dreyfus case,\" he wrote in 1899, \"embodies more than a judicial  error; it embodies the desire of the vast majority of the French to  condemn a Jew, and to condemn all Jews in this one Jew. Death to the  Jews! howled the mob, as the decorations were being ripped from the  captain's coat.... Where? In France. In republican, modern, civilized  France, a hundred years after the Declaration of the Rights of Man.  The French people, or at any rate the greater part of the French  people, does not want to extend the rights of man to Jews. The edict  of the great Revolution had been revoked.\"    Illumined thus in retrospect, the \"curious excitement\" which gripped  Herzl on that occasion takes on a special significance. \"Until that  time most of us believed that the solution of the Jewish question was  to be patiently waited for as part of the general development of  mankind. But when a people which in every other respect is so  progressive and so highly civilized can take such a turn, what are we  to expect from other peoples, which have not even attained the level  which France attained a hundred years ago?\"    In that fateful moment, when he heard the howling of the mob outside  the gates of the _Ecole Militaire_, the realization flashed upon Herzl  that anti-Semitism was deep-rooted in the heart of the people--so  deep, indeed, that it was impossible to hope for its disappearance  within a measurable period of time. Precisely because he was so  sensitive to his honor as a Jew, precisely because he had proclaimed,  in the _New Ghetto_, the ideal of human reconciliation, and had taken  the ultimate decision to stand by his Jewishness, the ghastly  spectacle of that winter morning must have shaken him to the depths of  his being. It was as if the ground had been cut away from under his  feet. In this sense Herzl could say later that the Dreyfus affair had  made him a Zionist.    He saw all about him the ever fiercer light of a blazing  anti-Semitism. In the French Chamber of Deputies the deputy Denis made  an interpellation on the influence of the Jews in the political  administration of the country. In Vienna a Jewish member of the  Reichstag rose to speak and was howled down. On April 2, 1895, were  held the municipal elections of Vienna, and there was an enormous  increase in the number of anti-Semitic aldermen. Changing plans passed  tumultuously through his mind. He wanted to write a book on \"The  Condition of the Jews,\" consisting of reports on all the important  Jewish colonization enterprises in Russia, Galicia, Hungary, Bohemia,  the Orient, and those more recently founded in Palestine, about which  he had heard from a relative. Alphonse Daudet, the famous French  author with whom he had discussed the whole matter, felt that Herzl  ought to write a novel; it would carry further than a play. \"Look at  _Uncle Tom's Cabin_.\"    He returned to his former plan of a Jewish novel which he had  abandoned when he was called to his assignment on the _Neue Freie  Presse_ in Paris. His friend Kana, the suicide, was no longer to be  the central figure. He was instead to be \"the weaker one, the beloved  friend of the hero,\" and would take his own life after a series of  misfortunes, while the Promised Land was being discovered or rather  founded. When the hero aboard the ship which was taking him to the  Promised Land would receive the moving farewell letter of his friend,  his first reaction after his horror would be one of rage: \"Idiot!  Fool! Miserable hopeless weakling! A life lost which belonged to us!\"    We can see the Zionist idea arising. Its outlines are still  indefinite, but the decisive idea is clearly visible; only by  migration can this upright human type be given its chance to emerge.  In _The New Ghetto_ Jacob Samuel is a hero because he knows how to  choose an honorable death. Now the death of a useful man is criminally  wasteful. For there are great tasks to be undertaken.    In essence it is the Act and not the Word that confronts us. What last  impulse it was that actually carried Herzl from the Word to the Act it  will be difficult to tell--he himself could not have given the answer.  Little things may play a dramatic role not less effectively than great  ones when a man is so charged with purpose as Herzl then was.    In the early days of May, Herzl addressed to Baron de Hirsch (the  sponsor of Jewish colonization in Argentina), the letter which opens  his Jewish political career. His request for an interview was granted.  Herzl prepared an outline of his position in notes, lest he omit  something important during their conversation.    In these notes he writes: \"If the Jews are to be transformed into men  of character in a reasonable period of time, say ten or twenty years,  or even forty--the interval needed by Moses--it cannot be done without  migration. Who is going to decide whether conditions are bad enough  today to warrant our migration? And whether the situation is hopeless?  And the Congress which you (i.e. Hirsch) have convened for the first  of August in a hotel in Switzerland? You will preside over this  Congress of notables. Your call will be heard and answered in every  part of the world.    \"And what will be the message given to the men assembled 'You are  pariahs! You must forever tremble at the thought that you are about  to be deprived of your rights and stripped of your possessions. You  will be insulted when you walk in the street. If you are poor, you  suffer doubly. If you are rich, you must conceal the fact. You are not  admitted to any honorable calling, and if you deal in money you are  made the special focus of contempt.... The situation will not change  for the better, but rather for the worse.... There is only way out:  into the Promised Land.'\"    Where the Promised Land was to be located, how it was to be acquired,  is not yet mentioned. Herzl does not seem to have thought this  question of decisive significance; it was a scientific matter. It was  the organization of the migration which held his attention, the  political preparations among the Powers, the preliminary changes to be  brought about among the masses by training, by \"tremendous propaganda,  the popularization of the idea through newspapers, books, pamphlets,  lectures, pictures, songs.\"    On the day of his conversation with Baron de Hirsch, Herzl wrote him a  long letter in which he sought to supplement the information and  impressions which had been the result of the meeting. \"Please believe  me, the political life of an entire people--particularly when that  people is scattered throughout the entire world--can be set in motion  only with imponderables floating high in the air. Do you know what the  German Reich sprang from? From dreams, songs, fantasies, and  gold-black bands worn by students. And that in a brief period of time.  What? You do not understand imponderables? And what is religion?  Bethink yourself what the Jews have endured for two thousand years for  the sake of this fantasy....    \"The exodus to the Promised Land presents itself as a tremendous  enterprise in transportation, unparalleled in the modern world. What  transportation? It is a complex of all human enterprises which we  shall fit Into each other like cog-wheels. And in the very first  stages of the enterprise we shall find employment for the ambitious  younger masses of our people: all the engineers, architects,  technologists, chemists, doctors, and lawyers, those who have emerged  in the last thirty years from the ghetto and who have been moved by  the faith that they can win their bread and a little honor outside the  framework of our Jewish business futilities. Today they must be filled  with despair, they constitute the foundation of a frightful  over-educated proletariat. But it is to these that all my love  belongs, and I am just as set on increasing their number as you are  set on diminishing it. It is in them that I perceive the latent power  of the Jewish people. In brief, my kind.\"    In this letter of June 3, 1895, Herzl for the first time imparted his  new Jewish policy to a stranger. The writing down of his views, as  well as his conversation on the subject, had had a stronger effect on  himself than on Hirsch. He had obtained a clear vision of the new and  revolutionary character of his proposals. On the same day or shortly  thereafter he began a diary under the title of _The Jewish Question_.    \"For some time now, I have been engaged upon a work of indescribable  greatness. I do not know yet"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#5)"],[1,"that, not because it foresees and desires the result of its  actions.*         * An interesting discussion of the question whether       instinctive actions, when first performed, involve any       prevision, however vague, will be found in Lloyd Morgan's       \"Instinct and Experience\" (Methuen, 1912), chap. ii.    Careful observers of animals, being anxious to avoid precarious  inferences, have gradually discovered more and more how to give  an account of the actions of animals without assuming what we call  \"consciousness.\" It has seemed to the behaviourists that similar methods  can be applied to human behaviour, without assuming anything not open  to external observation. Let us give a crude illustration, too crude for  the authors in question, but capable of affording a rough insight into  their meaning. Suppose two children in a school, both of whom are asked  \"What is six times nine?\" One says fifty-four, the other says fifty-six.  The one, we say, \"knows\" what six times nine is, the other does not. But  all that we can observe is a certain language-habit. The one child has  acquired the habit of saying \"six times nine is fifty-four\"; the other  has not. There is no more need of \"thought\" in this than there is when  a horse turns into his accustomed stable; there are merely more numerous  and complicated habits. There is obviously an observable fact called  \"knowing\" such-and-such a thing; examinations are experiments for  discovering such facts. But all that is observed or discovered is a  certain set of habits in the use of words. The thoughts (if any) in the  mind of the examinee are of no interest to the examiner; nor has the  examiner any reason to suppose even the most successful examinee capable  of even the smallest amount of thought.    Thus what is called \"knowing,\" in the sense in which we can ascertain  what other people \"know,\" is a phenomenon exemplified in their physical  behaviour, including spoken and written words. There is no reason--so  Watson argues--to suppose that their knowledge IS anything beyond the  habits shown in this behaviour: the inference that other people  have something nonphysical called \"mind\" or \"thought\" is therefore  unwarranted.    So far, there is nothing particularly repugnant to our prejudices in the  conclusions of the behaviourists. We are all willing to admit that  other people are thoughtless. But when it comes to ourselves, we feel  convinced that we can actually perceive our own thinking. \"Cogito, ergo  sum\" would be regarded by most people as having a true premiss. This,  however, the behaviourist denies. He maintains that our knowledge of  ourselves is no different in kind from our knowledge of other people.  We may see MORE, because our own body is easier to observe than that of  other people; but we do not see anything radically unlike what we see  of others. Introspection, as a separate source of knowledge, is entirely  denied by psychologists of this school. I shall discuss this question at  length in a later lecture; for the present I will only observe that  it is by no means simple, and that, though I believe the behaviourists  somewhat overstate their case, yet there is an important element of  truth in their contention, since the things which we can discover by  introspection do not seem to differ in any very fundamental way from the  things which we discover by external observation.    So far, we have been principally concerned with knowing. But it might  well be maintained that desiring is what is really most characteristic  of mind. Human beings are constantly engaged in achieving some end  they feel pleasure in success and pain in failure. In a purely material  world, it may be said, there would be no opposition of pleasant and  unpleasant, good and bad, what is desired and what is feared. A man's  acts are governed by purposes. He decides, let us suppose, to go to a  certain place, whereupon he proceeds to the station, takes his ticket  and enters the train. If the usual route is blocked by an accident,  he goes by some other route. All that he does is determined--or so it  seems--by the end he has in view, by what lies in front of him, rather  than by what lies behind. With dead matter, this is not the case.  A stone at the top of a hill may start rolling, but it shows no  pertinacity in trying to get to the bottom. Any ledge or obstacle will  stop it, and it will exhibit no signs of discontent if this happens. It  is not attracted by the pleasantness of the valley, as a sheep or cow  might be, but propelled by the steepness of the hill at the place  where it is. In all this we have characteristic differences between the  behaviour of animals and the behaviour of matter as studied by physics.    Desire, like knowledge, is, of course, in one sense an observable  phenomenon. An elephant will eat a bun, but not a mutton chop; a duck  will go into the water, but a hen will not. But when we think of our  own desires, most people believe that we can know them by an immediate  self-knowledge which does not depend upon observation of our actions.  Yet if this were the case, it would be odd that people are so often  mistaken as to what they desire. It is matter of common observation that  \"so-and-so does not know his own motives,\" or that \"A is envious of B  and malicious about him, but quite unconscious of being so.\" Such people  are called self-deceivers, and are supposed to have had to go through  some more or less elaborate process of concealing from themselves what  would otherwise have been obvious. I believe that this is an entire  mistake. I believe that the discovery of our own motives can only be  made by the same process by which we discover other people's, namely,  the process of observing our actions and inferring the desire which  could prompt them. A desire is \"conscious\" when we have told ourselves  that we have it. A hungry man may say to himself: \"Oh, I do want my  lunch.\" Then his desire is \"conscious.\" But it only differs from an  \"unconscious\" desire by the presence of appropriate words, which is by  no means a fundamental difference.    The belief that a motive is normally conscious makes it easier to be  mistaken as to our own motives than as to other people's. When some  desire that we should be ashamed of is attributed to us, we notice that  we have never had it consciously, in the sense of saying to ourselves,  \"I wish that would happen.\" We therefore look for some other  interpretation of our actions, and regard our friends as very unjust  when they refuse to be convinced by our repudiation of what we hold to  be a calumny. Moral considerations greatly increase the difficulty of  clear thinking in this matter. It is commonly argued that people are not  to blame for unconscious motives, but only for conscious ones. In order,  therefore, to be wholly virtuous it is only necessary to repeat virtuous  formulas. We say: \"I desire to be kind to my friends, honourable in  business, philanthropic towards the poor, public-spirited in politics.\"  So long as we refuse to allow ourselves, even in the watches of the  night, to avow any contrary desires, we may be bullies at home, shady in  the City, skinflints in paying wages and profiteers in dealing with the  public; yet, if only conscious motives are to count in moral valuation,  we shall remain model characters. This is an agreeable doctrine, and  it is not surprising that men are un willing to abandon it. But moral  considerations are the worst enemies of the scientific spirit and we  must dismiss them from our minds if we wish to arrive at truth.    I believe--as I shall try to prove in a later lecture--that desire,  like force in mechanics, is of the nature of a convenient fiction  for describing shortly certain laws of behaviour. A hungry animal is  restless until it finds food; then it becomes quiescent. The thing which  will bring a restless condition to an end is said to be what is desired.  But only experience can show what will have this sedative effect, and it  is easy to make mistakes. We feel dissatisfaction, and think that  such and-such a thing would remove it; but in thinking this, we are  theorizing, not observing a patent fact. Our theorizing is often  mistaken, and when it is mistaken there is a difference between what we  think we desire and what in fact will bring satisfaction. This is such  a common phenomenon that any theory of desire which fails to account for  it must be wrong.    What have been called \"unconscious\" desires have been brought very much  to the fore in recent years by psycho-analysis. Psycho-analysis, as  every one knows, is primarily a method of understanding hysteria and  certain forms of insanity*; but it has been found that there is much  in the lives of ordinary men and women which bears a humiliating  resemblance to the delusions of the insane. The connection of dreams,  irrational beliefs and foolish actions with unconscious wishes has been  brought to light, though with some exaggeration, by Freud and Jung and  their followers. As regards the nature of these unconscious wishes,  it seems to me--though as a layman I speak with diffidence--that many  psycho-analysts are unduly narrow; no doubt the wishes they emphasize  exist, but others, e.g. for honour and power, are equally operative and  equally liable to concealment. This, however, does not affect the  value of their general theories from the point of view of theoretic  psychology, and it is from this point of view that their results are  important for the analysis of mind.         * There is a wide field of \"unconscious\" phenomena which       does not depend upon psycho-analytic theories. Such       occurrences as automatic writing lead Dr. Morton Prince to       say: \"As I view this question of the subconscious, far too       much weight is given to the point of awareness or not       awareness of our conscious processes. As a matter of fact,       we find entirely"]]]
