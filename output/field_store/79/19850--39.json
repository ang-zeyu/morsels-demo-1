But a glance at her watch told her that  Frances must already be halfway to Ashland. So she could only accept  the situation.    \"Well, anyway,\" she thought, \"I'll get Mary to point Sara Beaumont out  to me, and I'll store up a description of her in my mind to tell Fran  tonight. I must remember to take notice of the colour of her eyes.  Fran has always been exercised about that.\"    It was mid-forenoon when Frances arrived at Ashland station.  Grandmother Newbury's man, Hiram, was waiting for her with the pony  carriage, and Frances heartily enjoyed the three-mile drive to the Bay  Shore Farm.    Grandmother Newbury came to the door to meet her granddaughter. She  was a tall, handsome old lady with piercing black eyes and thick white  hair. There was no savour of the traditional grandmother of caps and  knitting about her. She was like a stately old princess and, much as  her grandchildren admired her, they were decidedly in awe of her.    \"So it is Frances,\" she said, bending her head graciously that Frances  might kiss her still rosy cheek. \"I expected it would be Cecilia. I  heard after I had written you that there was to be a gubernatorial  picnic in Claymont today, so I was quite sure it would be Cecilia. Why  isn't it Cecilia?\"    Frances flushed a little. There was a meaning tone in Grandmother  Newbury's voice.    \"Cecilia was very anxious to go to the picnic today to see an old  friend of hers,\" she answered. \"She was willing to come here, but you  know, Grandmother, that Cecilia is always willing to do the things  somebody else ought to do, so I decided I would stand on my rights as  'Miss Newbury' for once and come to the Bay Shore.\"    Grandmother Newbury smiled. She understood. Frances had always been  her favourite granddaughter, but she had never been blind,  clear-sighted old lady that she was, to the little leaven of  easy-going selfishness in the girl's nature. She was pleased to see  that Frances had conquered it this time.    \"I'm glad it is you who have come--principally because you are  cleverer than Cecilia,\" she said brusquely. \"Or at least you are the  better talker. And I want a clever girl and a good talker to help me  entertain a guest today. She's clever herself, and she likes young  girls. She is a particular friend of your Uncle Robert's family down  south, and that is why I have asked her to spend a few days with me.  You'll like her.\"    Here Grandmother Newbury led Frances into the sitting-room.    \"Mrs. Kennedy, this is my granddaughter, Frances Newbury. I told you  about her and her ambitions last night. You see, Frances, we have  talked you over.\"    Mrs. Kennedy was a much younger woman than Grandmother Newbury. She  was certainly no more than fifty and, in spite of her grey hair,  looked almost girlish, so bright were her dark eyes, so clear-cut and  fresh her delicate face, and so smart her general appearance. Frances,  although not given to sudden likings, took one for Mrs. Kennedy. She  thought she had never seen so charming a face.    She found herself enjoying the day immensely. In fact, she forgot the  Governor's picnic and Sara Beaumont altogether. Mrs. Kennedy proved to  be a delightful companion. She had travelled extensively and was an  excellent _raconteur_. She had seen much of men and women and  crystallized her experiences into sparkling little sentences and  epigrams which made Frances feel as if she were listening to one of  the witty people in clever books. But under all her sparkling wit  there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true womanly sympathy and  kind-heartedness which won affection as speedily as her brilliance won  admiration. Frances listened and laughed and enjoyed. Once she found  time to think that she would have missed a great deal if she had not  come to Bay Shore Farm that day. Surely talking to a woman like Mrs.  Kennedy was better than looking at Sara Beaumont from a distance.    \"I've been 'rewarded' in the most approved storybook style,\" she  thought with amusement.    In the afternoon, Grandmother Newbury packed Mrs. Kennedy and Frances  off for a walk.    \"The old woman wants to have her regular nap,\" she told them.  \"Frances, take Mrs. Kennedy to the fern walk and show her the famous  'Newbury Bubble' among the rocks. I want to be rid of you both until  tea-time.\"    Frances and Mrs. Kennedy went to the fern walk and the beautiful  \"Bubble\"--a clear, round spring of amber-hued water set down in a cup  of rock overhung with ferns and beeches. It was a spot Frances had  always loved. She found herself talking freely to Mrs. Kennedy of her  hopes and plans. The older woman drew the girl out with tactful  sympathy until she found that Frances's dearest ambition was some day  to be a writer of books like Sara Beaumont.    \"Not that I expect ever to write books like hers,\" she said hurriedly,  \"and I know it must be a long while before I can write anything worth  while at all. But do you think--if I try hard and work hard--that I  might do something in this line some day?\"    \"I think so,\" said Mrs. Kennedy, smiling, \"if, as you say, you are  willing to work hard and study hard. There will be a great deal of  both and many disappointments. Sara Beaumont herself had a hard time  at first--and for a very long first too. Her family was poor, you  know, and Sara earned enough money to send away her first manuscripts  by making a pot of jelly for a neighbour. The manuscripts came back,  and Sara made more jelly and wrote more stories. Still they came back.  Once she thought she had better give up writing stories and stick to  the jelly alone. There did seem some little demand for the one and  none at all for the other. But she determined to keep on until she  either succeeded or proved to her own satisfaction that she could make  better jelly than stories. And you see she did succeed. But it means  perseverance and patience and much hard work. Prepare yourself for  that, Frances, and one day you will win your place. Then you will look  back to the 'Newbury Bubble,' and you will tell me what a good  prophetess I was.\"    They talked longer--an earnest, helpful talk that went far to inspire  Frances's hazy ambition with a definite purpose. She understood that  she must not write merely to win fame for herself or even for the  higher motive of pure pleasure in her work. She must aim, however  humbly, to help her readers to higher planes of thought and  endeavour. Then and only then would it be worth while.    \"Mrs. Kennedy is going to drive you to the station,\" said Grandmother  Newbury after tea. \"I am much obliged to you, Frances, for giving up  the picnic today and coming to the Bay Shore to gratify an old woman's  inconvenient whim. But I shall not burden you with too much gratitude,  for I think you have enjoyed yourself.\"    \"Indeed, I have,\" said Frances heartily. Then she added with a laugh,  \"I think I would feel much more meritorious if it had not been so  pleasant. It has robbed me of all the self-sacrificing complacency I  felt this morning. You see, I wanted to go to that picnic to see Sara  Beaumont, and I felt quite like a martyr at giving it up.\"    Grandmother Newbury's eyes twinkled. \"You would have been beautifully  disappointed had you gone. Sara Beaumont was not there. Mrs. Kennedy,  I see you haven't told our secret. Frances, my dear, let me introduce  you two over again. This lady is Mrs. Sara Beaumont Kennedy, the  writer of _The Story of Idlewild_ and all those other books you so  much admire.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Newburys were sitting on the verandah at dusk, too tired and too  happy to talk. Ralph and Elliott had seen the Governor; more than  that, they had been introduced to him, and he had shaken hands with  them both and told them that their father and he had been chums when  just their size. And Cecilia had spent a whole day with Nan Harris,  who had not changed at all except to grow taller. But there was one  little cloud on her content.    \"I wanted to see Sara Beaumont to tell Frances about her, but I  couldn't get a glimpse of her. I don't even know if she was there.\"    \"There comes Fran up the station road now,\" said Ralph. \"My eyes,  hasn't she a step!\"    Frances came smiling over the lawn and up the steps.    \"So you are all home safe,\" she said gaily. \"I hope you feasted your  eyes on your beloved Governor, boys. I can tell that Cecilia  forgathered with Nan by the beatific look on her face.\"    \"Oh, Fran, it was lovely!\" cried Cecilia. \"But I felt so sorry--why  didn't you let me go to Ashland? It was too bad you missed it--and  Sara Beaumont.\"    \"Sara Beaumont was at the Bay Shore Farm,\" said Frances. \"I'll tell  you all about it when I get my breath--I've been breathless ever since  Grandmother Newbury told me of it. There's only one drawback to my  supreme bliss--the remembrance of how complacently self-sacrificing I  felt this morning. It humiliates me wholesomely to remember it!\"          Elizabeth's Child      The Ingelows, of Ingelow Grange, were not a marrying family. Only one  of them, Elizabeth, had married, and perhaps it was her \"poor match\"  that discouraged the others. At any rate, Ellen and Charlotte and  George Ingelow at the Grange were single, and so was Paul down at  Greenwood Farm.    It was seventeen years since Elizabeth had married James Sheldon in  the face of the most decided opposition on the part of her family.  Sheldon was a handsome, shiftless ne'er-do-well, without any violent  bad habits, but also \"without any backbone,\" as the Ingelows declared.  \"There is sometimes hope of a man who is actively bad,\" Charlotte  Ingelow had said sententiously, \"but who ever heard of reforming a  jellyfish?\"    Elizabeth and her husband had gone west and settled on a prairie farm  in Manitoba. She had never been home since. Perhaps her pride kept her  away, for she had the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#5)"],[1,"happy. As for Laddie, who was sitting beside  him with his shaggy head on Ernest's knee, I really believe the dog  understood, too. The look in his eyes was almost human. Uncle Richard  leaned over and patted him.    \"Good dog!\" he said. \"Good dog!\"          At Five O'Clock in the Morning      Fate, in the guise of Mrs. Emory dropping a milk-can on the platform  under his open window, awakened Murray that morning. Had not Mrs.  Emory dropped that can, he would have slumbered peacefully until his  usual hour for rising--a late one, be it admitted, for of all the  boarders at Sweetbriar Cottage Murray was the most irregular in his  habits.    \"When a young man,\" Mrs. Emory was wont to remark sagely and a trifle  severely, \"prowls about that pond half of the night, a-chasing of  things what he calls 'moonlight effecks,' it ain't to be wondered at  that he's sleepy in the morning. And it ain't the convenientest thing,  nuther and noways, to keep the breakfast table set till the farm folks  are thinking of dinner. But them artist men are not like other people,  say what you will, and allowance has to be made for them. And I must  say that I likes him real well and approves of him every other way.\"    If Murray had slept late that morning--well, he shudders yet over that  \"if.\" But aforesaid Fate saw to it that he woke when the hour of  destiny and the milk-can struck, and having awakened he found he could  not go to sleep again. It suddenly occurred to him that he had never  seen a sunrise on the pond. Doubtless it would be very lovely down  there in those dewy meadows at such a primitive hour; he decided to  get up and see what the world looked like in the young daylight.    He scowled at a letter lying on his dressing table and thrust it into  his pocket that it might be out of sight. He had written it the night  before and the writing of it was going to cost him several things--a  prospective million among others. So it is hardly to be wondered at if  the sight of it did not reconcile him to the joys of early rising.    \"Dear life and heart!\" exclaimed Mrs. Emory, pausing in the act of  scalding a milk-can when Murray emerged from a side door. \"What on  earth is the matter, Mr. Murray? You ain't sick now, surely? I told  you them pond fogs was p'isen after night! If you've gone and got--\"    \"Nothing is the matter, dear lady,\" interrupted Murray, \"and I haven't  gone and got anything except an acute attack of early rising which is  not in the least likely to become chronic. But at what hour of the  night do you get up, you wonderful woman? Or rather do you ever go to  bed at all? Here is the sun only beginning to rise and--positively  yes, you have all your cows milked.\"    Mrs. Emory purred with delight.    \"Folks as has fourteen cows to milk has to rise betimes,\" she answered  with proud humility. \"Laws, I don't complain--I've lots of help with  the milking. How Mrs. Palmer manages, I really cannot comperhend--or  rather, how she has managed. I suppose she'll be all right now since  her niece came last night. I saw her posting to the pond pasture not  ten minutes ago. She'll have to milk all them seven cows herself. But  dear life and heart! Here I be palavering away and not a bite of  breakfast ready for you!\"    \"I don't want any breakfast until the regular time for it,\" assured  Murray. \"I'm going down to the pond to see the sun rise.\"    \"Now don't you go and get caught in the ma'sh,\" anxiously called Mrs.  Emory, as she never failed to do when she saw him starting for the  pond. Nobody ever had got caught in the marsh, but Mrs. Emory lived in  a chronic state of fear lest someone should.    \"And if you once got stuck in that black mud you'd be sucked right  down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment,  like Adam Palmer's cow,\" she was wont to warn her boarders.    Murray sought his favourite spot for pond dreaming--a bloomy corner of  the pasture that ran down into the blue water, with a dump of leafy  maples on the left. He was very glad he had risen early. A miracle was  being worked before his very eyes. The world was in a flush and  tremor of maiden loveliness, instinct with all the marvellous fleeting  charm of girlhood and spring and young morning. Overhead the sky was a  vast high-sprung arch of unstained crystal. Down over the sand dunes,  where the pond ran out into the sea, was a great arc of primrose  smitten through with auroral crimsonings. Beneath it the pond waters  shimmered with a hundred fairy hues, but just before him they were  clear as a flawless mirror. The fields around him glistened with dews,  and a little wandering wind, blowing lightly from some bourne in the  hills, strayed down over the slopes, bringing with it an unimaginable  odour and freshness, and fluttered over the pond, leaving a little  path of dancing silver ripples across the mirror-glory of the water.  Birds were singing in the beech woods over on Orchard Knob Farm,  answering to each other from shore to shore, until the very air was  tremulous with the elfin music of this wonderful midsummer dawn.    \"I will get up at sunrise every morning of my life hereafter,\"  exclaimed Murray rapturously, not meaning a syllable of it, but  devoutly believing he did.    Just as the fiery disc of the sun peered over the sand dunes Murray  heard music that was not of the birds. It was a girl's voice singing  beyond the maples to his left--a clear sweet voice, blithely trilling  out the old-fashioned song, \"Five O'Clock in the Morning.\"    \"Mrs. Palmer's niece!\"    Murray sprang to his feet and tiptoed cautiously through the maples.  He had heard so much from Mrs. Palmer about her niece that he felt  reasonably well acquainted with her. Moreover, Mrs. Palmer had assured  him that Mollie was a very pretty girl. Now a pretty girl milking cows  at sunrise in the meadows sounded well.    Mrs. Palmer had not over-rated her niece's beauty. Murray said so to  himself with a little whistle of amazement as he leaned unseen on the  pasture fence and looked at the girl who was milking a placid Jersey  less than ten yards away from him. Murray's artistic instinct  responded to the whole scene with a thrill of satisfaction.    He could see only her profile, but that was perfect, and the colouring  of the oval cheek and the beautiful curve of the chin were something  to adore. Her hair, ruffled into lovable little ringlets by the  morning wind, was coiled in glistening chestnut masses high on her  bare head, and her arms, bare to the elbow, were as white as marble.  Presently she began to sing again, and this time Murray joined in. She  half rose from her milking stool and cast a startled glance at the  maples. Then she dropped back again and began to milk determinedly,  but Murray could have sworn that he saw a demure smile hovering about  her lips. That, and the revelation of her full face, decided him. He  sprang over the fence and sauntered across the intervening space of  lush clover blossoms.    \"Good morning,\" he said coolly. He had forgotten her other name, and  it did not matter; at five o'clock in the morning people who met in  dewy clover fields might disregard the conventionalities. \"Isn't it  rather a large contract for you to be milking seven cows all alone?  May I help you?\"    Mollie looked up at him over her shoulder. She had glorious grey eyes.  Her face was serene and undisturbed. \"Can you milk?\" she asked.    \"Unlikely as it may seem, I can,\" said Murray. \"I have never confessed  it to Mrs. Emory, because I was afraid she would inveigle me into  milking her fourteen cows. But I don't mind helping you. I learned to  milk when I was a shaver on my vacations at a grandfatherly farm. May  I have that extra pail?\"    Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey. Before  sitting down he seemed struck with an idea.    \"My name is Arnold Murray. I board at Sweetbriar Cottage, next farm to  Orchard Knob. That makes us near neighbours.\"    \"I suppose it does,\" said Mollie.    Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever  heard. He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he  could study her profile. It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer's niece  should have such a profile. It looked as if centuries of fine breeding  were responsible for it.    \"What a morning!\" he said enthusiastically. \"It harks back to the days  when earth was young. They must have had just such mornings as this in  Eden.\"    \"Do you always get up so early?\" asked Mollie practically.    \"Always,\" said Murray without a blush. Then--\"But no, that is a fib,  and I cannot tell fibs to you. The truth is your tribute. I never get  up early. It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning.  The morning is a miracle--and you, I might suppose you were born of  the sunrise, if Mrs. Palmer hadn't told me all about you.\"    \"What did she tell you about me?\" asked Mollie, changing cows. Murray  discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron  shrouded a singularly graceful figure.    \"She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county. I have seen  very few of the girls in Bruce county, but I know she is right.\"    \"That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one,\" said  Mollie reflectively. \"Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you,\" she  added.    \"Curiosity knows no gender,\" hinted Murray.    \"She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other  people.\"    \"All compliments,\" said Murray in a gratified tone.    \"Lazy?\"    \"Certainly. Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days, I was not  born with it, but I have painstakingly acquired it, and I am proud of  my success. I have time to enjoy life.\"    \"I think that I like you,\" said Mollie.    \"You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation,\" he  assured her.    When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the  spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the"]]]
