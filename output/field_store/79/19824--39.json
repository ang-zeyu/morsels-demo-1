After going down the  Hoogly to Saugor Island, we made our way into the district called the  Sunderbuns by one of the channels of the Ganges. We got into a labyrinth  of streams, every here and there opening up into a wide reach of water,  giving one the impression we were entering a lake; and shortly  afterwards we found ourselves in a channel so narrow that we almost  touched the banks on both sides, and which barely allowed a passage  where there was a sharp turn in the stream. We had native pilots who  knew the region thoroughly, and were in no danger of going astray. The  land down to the water's edge was covered with the densest tropical  vegetation, so that the banks often bounded our view, except when the  trees on it were lower than those beyond. In the waters and out, wild  beasts abound. Alligators were seen dropping from the banks into the  stream on hearing the approach of the steamer. We saw no tigers, but we  heard much about them as we were threading our way through that region.  The previous year, early one morning, the watch on the deck of the flat  was startled by a tiger leaping on board, and, evidently bewildered by  its new circumstances, leaping off on the other side. Messrs. Lacroix  and Gogerly, when on a native boat in the Sunderbuns, were witnesses of  a desperate fight between a tiger and an alligator. The story has been  often told.    Less than two centuries ago there was a large population in what may be  called that amphibious region, the soil when cleared being very rich;  but owing to the incursions of Mug pirates from the coast of Burmah, and  the oppression of Muhammadan rulers of Bengal, the most of the  inhabitants perished, others fled, and so complete was the ruin that the  exact site of once prosperous cities is unknown. In a region like the  Sunderbuns, when man's restraining and improving hand is withdrawn every  trace of his presence disappears under the rank vegetation, which  speedily covers the sphere of his labours. The country, under British  protection, was in 1839 beginning to be reoccupied. Patches of ground  were reclaimed from the jungle, and since that time cultivation has been  greatly extended. We occasionally met native boats, and were thus  reminded we were not the only human begins in that district. Nearly a  week elapsed before we emerged from the Sunderbuns.    Our passengers were a motley band. Between twenty and thirty were  Europeans, two or three were Eurasians, and there was a company of  Sepoys under a native officer in charge of treasure. Most of the Sepoys  were Hindus, and as they cannot cook on the water, which is forbidden by  caste-law, they were obliged to subsist as they best could on dry grain.  The Muhammadans had no convenience for cooking on the flat, but they  were allowed partial use of the steamer. All were delighted when they  got into the open country, and could get on shore at night to prepare  their meals.    The steamer and flat were brought to anchor at all the important towns  on the river, for lading and unlading goods and for landing passengers,  of whom very few left us, as most were bound for Benares and Allahabad.  When evening came on we always anchored, wherever we might be. We saw a  little of Bhagulpore, Monghyr, Dinapore, Patna, Ghazeepore, and some  other places. At Monghyr I spent a very pleasant evening with Mr. Leslie  of the Baptist Mission, even then of considerable standing, and years  afterwards a highly esteemed veteran in the missionary host.    [Sidenote: A STORM ON THE GANGES.]    Our progress was slow. In some places the stream was too strong for our  steamer tugging the flat, and in other places the water was too shallow.  Sometimes we got for hours, in one case for a whole day, on sandbanks,  from which we got off with great difficulty. The most memorable incident  of the voyage was a storm, which came on us one evening as we were  nearing Dinapore. There was so little warning of its approach that we,  who knew not the climate, were quite unprepared for its coming. Before  breaking on us we were brought to a standstill, the flat was separated  from the steamer, and both flat and steamer were brought to anchor. The  sky suddenly became dark, we heard puffs of wind, and then the storm  burst on us in all its fury. The dust was so raised that we could see  only a few feet from the flat, and the flat so rolled that every now and  then a splash of water came in at the windows. A scene of great  confusion ensued. Some Indo-Portuguese servants were on their knees,  imploring Mary--\"Mariam, Mariam!\"--to save them. The Hindus were loud in  their appeals to \"Ram, Ram!\" while the Muhammadans shouted \"Allah,  Allah!\" A newly arrived English lady almost fainted from fright, and her  husband tried to calm and assure her. Every face indicated anxiety. In  less than an hour all was over, and we were thankful to find ourselves  once more in safety.    Before leaving England I had possessed myself of a Hindustanee Grammar,  and in Calcutta of a Hindustanee Dictionary. On the voyage to India I  did not make much of the grammar, but on the way to Benares I gave  myself resolutely to learning the language. I found a young native  officer on the flat who knew a little English, and who professed to be a  good Hindustanee scholar. I got the consent of the native officer in  command to his coming to my cabin when off duty, and I spent hours daily  with him, trying to get my tongue about the strange sounds, with which I  knew I must be familiar if I was to do the work for which I had come to  India. I received great help from this young Muhammadan, and felt as if  I was beginning to get my foot into the language before reaching my  destination.    On the three Sabbaths I was on the river I had the pleasure of preaching  to the Europeans on board.    A voyage on the Ganges does not enable one to see much of the country.  The banks are often very high; in many places there is a great extent of  sand; the country, with the exception of the district where the main  stream is entered, is very level, and the country is therefore very  imperfectly seen. The native craft, so unlike the vessels of our own  country, with their lofty prows and sterns, and great ragged square  sails, many laden with wood and grass, which made them like moving  stacks, were constant objects of interest.    At length, after more than three weeks on board, we were delighted one  Sunday forenoon to see in the distance the domes and minarets of  Benares.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER III.    ARRIVAL AT BENARES.      On Sabbath, March 31, 1839, we came to anchor at the northern end of  Benares, at a place called Raj Ghat, the ferry connecting the city on  the left bank of the river with the Trunk road on the right, leading to  Behar and Bengal. Near this place the most of the native craft employed  in the city traffic is moored. Many of the vessels are of considerable  size.    For hours Benares had been in sight, but owing to the strength of the  stream our progress had been slow. It was early afternoon by the time of  our arrival. In so public a place as Raj Ghat there are always a number  of people, but the early afternoon is a time when few bathe, and there  is a lull in the stir of the community. As the afternoon comes on, and  the evening advances, there is fresh activity. We therefore, on landing,  saw little of the scene with which we were afterwards to become  familiar.    Word of the approach of our steamer and flat had reached Secrole, the  European suburb of Benares, three miles inland, and no sooner had we  come to anchor than the agent of the Steam Company and the friends of  expected passengers came on board. Among these was the Rev. William  Smith of the Baptist Mission, whose house was on the high bank  immediately above Raj Ghat, and who had been requested by my brethren of  the London Missionary Society to be on the look-out for me. This good  man gave me a kindly welcome, and took me with him to his house, built  very much in the native fashion, with flat roof, with small, low rooms  entering from one into another, and a verandah extending along its  front, from which a commanding view was obtained of the river and craft  below, the country on the other side of the river, and a part of the  front of the city. Immediately behind the house was the chapel, in which  daily worship was conducted.    [Sidenote: PREACHING TO BEGGARS.]    The first thing I saw on getting to Mr. Smith's house was the chapel  crowded with very poor-looking people, of whom a number were blind and  lame. I was told these were beggars, who came every Lord's-day to  receive a dole, either pice or dry grain, from the missionary and his  wife, and who listened very patiently to an address before the dole was  given. This service was kept up for many years, and there was no falling  off in the attendance. Those who have read the life of Henry Martyn, and  others of the early missionary period in India, know that they  ministered to this class. Here were persons whose destitution appealed  directly to the Christian heart, and who were content to be present when  the gospel message was delivered, while little access to others could be  obtained. How far these poor people heard it would be difficult to say.  I am afraid few heard with any desire to understand and consider what  was said, but there is every reason to believe some did obtain lasting  spiritual good. We have heard of instances of genuine conversion, though  it must be admitted these were rare; and it must be also acknowledged  there were instances of pretended conversion, when the life soon proved  that the motive for seeking baptism was entirely sordid. Still the work  in itself was worthy of the followers of Christ, and could not fail to  make a favourable impression, not only on the persons helped, but on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#5)"],[1,"accustomed to government by military  power, and sought to end it by the speediest practicable means. As he  expressed it, \"We must begin and mould from disorganized and discordant  elements: nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal  people, differ among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and measure of  reconstruction.\"    Louisiana was wholly in possession of the Union forces and under  loyal influence in 1863, and in his judgment the time had come for  reconstructive action in that state--not merely for the purpose of  strengthening and crystallizing the Union sentiment there, at a great  gate-way of commerce, that would become a conspicuous object-lesson to  foreign governments in behalf of more favorable influences abroad, but  also to the encouragement of Union men and the discouragement of the  rebellion in all the other revolted States. He had fortified his own  judgment, as he frankly declared, \"by submitting the Louisiana plan in  advance to every member of the Cabinet, and every member approved it.\"    The steps taken in Louisiana were to be but a beginning. The nature of  subsequent proceedings on his part must be governed by the success of  this--that under then existing conditions it was inexpedient, in view  of further possible complications, to forecast further proceedings, and  especially to attempt to establish, at the outset, and under the chaotic  conditions of the time, a general system of reconstruction applicable to  all the States and to varying conditions. So the beginning was made in  Louisiana. It is manifest that the purpose of this immediate action was  two-fold--not only to restore Louisiana to the Union at the earliest  practicable day--but also to so far establish a process of general  restoration before Congress should reconvene at the coming December  session, that there would be no sufficient occasion or excuse for  interfering with his work by the application of the exasperating  conditions that had been foreshadowed by that body.    On this point Mr. Welles, his Secretary of the Navy, testifies that at  the close of a Cabinet meeting held immediately preceding Mr. Lincoln's  death, \"Mr. Stanton made some remarks on the general condition of  affairs and the new phase and duties upon which we were about to enter.  He alluded to the great solicitude which the President felt on this  subject, his frequent recurrence to the necessity of establishing civil  governments and preserving order in the rebel States. Like the rest of  the Cabinet, doubtless, he had given this subject much consideration,  and with a view of having something practical on which to base action,  he had drawn up a rough plan or ordinance which he had handed to the  President.    \"The President said he proposed to bring forward that subject, although  he had not had time as yet to give much attention to the details of the  paper which the Secretary of War had given him only the day before; but  that it was substantially, in its general scope, the plan which we had  sometimes talked over in Cabinet meetings. We should probably make some  modifications, prescribe further details; there were some suggestions  which he should wish to make, and he desired all to bring their minds to  the question, for no greater or more important one could come before  us, or any future Cabinet. He thought it providential that, this great  rebellion was crushed just as Congress had adjourned, AND THERE WERE  NONE OF THE DISTURBING ELEMENTS OF THAT BODY TO HINDER AND EMBARRASS US.  If we were wise and discreet, we should reanimate, the States and get  their governments in successful operation, with order prevailing and the  Union reestablished, BEFORE CONGRESS CAME TOGETHER IN DECEMBER. This he  thought important. We could do better, accomplish more without than with  them. There were men in Congress who, if their motives were good, were  nevertheless impracticable, and who possessed feelings of hate and  vindictiveness in which he did not sympathize and could not participate.  Each House of Congress, he said, had the undoubted right to receive  or reject members, the Executive had no control in this matter. But  Congress had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENTS, which the  President could recognize, and under existing laws treat as other  States, give the same mail facilities, collect taxes, appoint judges,  marshals, collectors, etc., subject, of course, to confirmation. There  were men who objected to these views, BUT THEY WERE NOT HERE, AND WE  MUST MAKE HASTE TO DO OUR DUTY BEFORE THEY CAME HERE.\"    The subjugated States were in a condition that could not be safely  permitted to continue for any indefinite period. It would be  inconsistent with the purpose of the war, incongruous to the American  system and idea of government, and antagonistic to American political,  or even commercial or social autonomy. Naturally upon Mr. Lincoln would  fall largely the duty and responsibility of formulating and inaugurating  some method of restoration. With the abolition of slavery, the  most difficult of settlement of all the obstacles in the way of  reconstruction had been removed. Naturally, too, during the later months  of the war, when it became manifest that the end of the struggle was  near, the question of reconstruction and the methods whereby it could be  most naturally, speedily, and effectively accomplished, came uppermost  in his mind. A humane, just man, and a sincere, broad-brained, patriot  and far-seeing statesman, he instinctively rejected the many drastic  schemes which filled a large portion of the public press of the North  and afterwards characterized many of the suggestions of Congressional  action. With him the prime purpose of the war was the preservation of  the political, territorial and economic integrity of the Republic--in a  word, to restore the Union, without needless humiliation to the defeated  party, or the imposition of unnecessarily rigorous terms which could  but result in future frictions--without slavery--and yet with sufficient  safeguards against future disloyal association of the sections; and that  purpose had been approved by an overwhelming majority of the people in  his re-election in 1864.    In these purposes and methods Mr. Lincoln appears to have had the active  sympathy and co-operation of his entire Cabinet, more especially of Mr.  Stanton, his Secretary of War. Indeed, Mr. Stanton is understood, from  the record, to have been the joint author, with Mr. Lincoln, of the  plan of reconstruction agreed upon at the later meetings of the Cabinet  immediately prior to Mr. Lincoln's death. Mr. Stanton proposed to put  it in the form of a military order--Mr. Lincoln made an Executive order.  The plan was embodied in what afterwards became known as the \"North  Carolina Proclamation,\" determined upon by Mr. Lincoln at his last  Cabinet meeting and promulgated by Mr. Johnson shortly after his  accession to the Presidency as Mr. Lincoln's successor, and is inserted  in a subsequent chapter.    Mr. Lincoln unquestionably comprehended the peculiar conditions under  which the Republican party had come to the control of the legislative  branch of the Government, and fully realized the incapacity of the  dominant element in that control for the delicate work of restoration  and reconstruction--leading a conquered and embittered people back  peacefully and successfully, without unnecessary friction, into  harmonious relations to the Union.    No such responsibility, no such herculean task, had ever before, in the  history of civilization, devolved upon any ruler or political party.    Mr. Lincoln seems to have realized the incapacity of party leaders  brought to the surface by the tumult and demoralization of the time,  whose only exploits and experiences were in the line of destruction and  who must approach the task with divided counsel, to cope successfully  with the delicate and responsible work of restoration the close of  the war had made imperative. He comprehended the incongruities which  characterized that great party better than its professed leaders, and  foresaw the futility of any effort on its part, at that time and in its  then temper, to the early establishment of any coherent or successful  method of restoration. Hence, unquestionably, his prompt action in that  behalf, and his failure to call the Congress into special session, to  the end that there should be no time unnecessarily consumed and lost  in the institution of some efficient form of civil government in the  returning States--some form that would have the sanction of intelligent  authority competent to restore and enforce public order, without the  dangers of delay and consequent disorder that must result, and did  afterwards result, from the protracted debates sure to follow and did  follow the sudden precipitation of the questions of reconstruction and  reconciliation upon a mass of Congressmen totally inexperienced in the  anomalous conditions of that time, or in the methods most needed for  their correction.    That Mr. Lincoln contemplated the ultimate and not remote  enfranchisement of the late slaves, is manifest from his suggestion to  Gov. Hahn, of Louisiana, hereinbefore quoted in connection with the  then approaching Convention for the re-establishment of State Government  there, and again still more manifest from his last public utterance on  April 11, 1865, deprecating the rejection by Congress of his plan for  the restoration of Louisiana, in which, he said, speaking of that action  by Congress rejecting the Louisiana bill: \"Grant that the colored male  desires the elective franchise. He will attain it sooner by saving the  already advanced steps towards it than by running back over them.\"    It is also apparent in the light of the succeeding history of that time  and of that question, that if Mr. Lincoln's views had been seconded  by Congress, the enfranchisement of the negro would"]]]
