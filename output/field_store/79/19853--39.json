There were many instances of his firmness in  resisting the offers of the Court, in which he showed himself proof  against all temptations.    We close our eyes upon this peaceful dwelling of the heroic senator, and  imagine ourselves in the reign of the second Charles, threading our way  into that 'court off the Strand,' where Marvel ended his days. We enter  the house, and climbing the stairs even to the second floor, perceive  the object of our warmest admiration. He is not alone, though there is  no possibility of confounding the poet with the courtier. Andrew Marvel  is plainly dressed, his figure is strong, and about the middle size, his  countenance open, and his complexion of a ruddy cast; his eyes are of a  soft hazel color, mild and steady; his eyebrows straight, and so  flexible as to mould without an effort into a satirical curve, if such  be the mind's desire; his mouth is close, and indicative of firmness;  and his brown hair falls gracefully back from a full and noble forehead.  He sits in an upright and determined manner upon an uneasy-looking  high-backed chair. A somewhat long table intervenes between him and his  visitor; one end of it is covered with a white cloth, and a dish of cold  meat is flanked by a loaf of bread and a dark earthenware jug. On the  opposite end is placed a bag of gold, beside which lies the  richly-embroidered glove which the cavalier with whom he is conversing  has flung off. There is strange contrast in the attitude of the two men.  Lord Danby lounges with the ease of a courtier and the grace of a  gentleman upon a chair of as stiff and uncomfortable an appearance as  that which is occupied after so upright a fashion by Andrew Marvel.    \"I have answered you, my lord,\" said the patriot, \"already. Methinks  there need be no further parley on the subject; it is not my first  temptation, though I most fervently desire it may be the last.\"    [Illustration: STAIRCASE.]    The nobleman took up his glove and drew it on. \"I again pray you to  consider,\" he said, \"whether, if with us, the very usefulness you so  much prize would not have a more extensive sphere. You would have larger  means of being useful.\"    \"My lord, I should certainly have the means of tempting usefulness to  forsake duty.\"    The cavalier rose, but the displeasure that flushed his countenance soon  faded before the serene and holy expression of Milton's friend.    \"And are you so determined?\" said his lordship, sorrowfully. \"Are you  really so determined? A thousand English pounds are there, and thrice  the sum--nay, any thing you ask----\"    \"My lord! my lord!\" interrupted Marvel, indignantly, \"this perseverance  borders upon insult. Nay, my good lord, you do not so intend it, but  your master does not understand me. Pray you, note this: two days ago  that meat was hot; it has remained cold since, and there is enough still  for to-morrow; and I am well content. A man so easily satisfied is not  likely to exchange an approving conscience for dross like that!\"    We pray God that the sin of Marvel's death did not rest with the great  ones of those times; but it was strange and sudden.[D] He did not leave  wherewith to bury the sheath of such a noble spirit, but his  constituents furnished forth a decent funeral, and would have erected a  monument to his memory in the church of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, where  he was interred; but the rector, blinded by the dust of royalty to the  merits of the man, refused the necessary permission. Marvel's name is  remembered, though the rector's has been long forgotten.[E]    Wood tells us, that Marvel was in his conversation very modest, and of  few words; and Cooke, the writer of his life, observes that he was very  reserved among those whom he did not know, but a most delightful and  improving companion among his friends. John Aubrey, who knew him  personally, thus describes him: 'He was of a middling stature, pretty  strong set, roundish cherry-checked, hazle-eyed, brown-haired.' He was  (as Wood also says) in conversation very modest, and of a very few  words. He was wont to say, that he would not drink high or freely with  any one with whom he would not trust his life.    Marvel lived among friends at Highgate; exactly opposite to his door was  the residence of General Ireton and his wife Bridget, the eldest  daughter of Oliver Cromwell; and which house still bears his name, and  is described in 'Prickett's History of Highgate,' one of those local  topographical works which deserve encouragement:--'Cromwell House is  supposed to have been built by the Protector, whose name it bears, about  the year 1630, as a residence for General Ireton, who married his  daughter and was one of the commanders of his army; it is, however, said  to have been the residence of Oliver Cromwell himself, but no mention is  made, either in history or in his biography, of his having ever lived at  Highgate. Tradition states, there was a subterraneous passage from this  house to the mansion house which stood where the New Church now stands,  but of its reality no proof has hitherto been adduced. Cromwell House  was evidently built and internally ornamented in accordance with the  taste of its military occupant. The staircase, which is of handsome  proportions, is richly decorated with oaken carved figures, supposed to  have been of persons in the general's army, in their costume; and the  balustrades filled in with devices emblematical of warfare. On the  ceilings of the drawing-room are the arms of General Ireton; this and  the ceilings of the other principal apartments are enriched in  conformity with the fashion of those days. The proportion of the noble  rooms, as well as the brick-work in front, well deserves the notice and  study of the antiquarian and the architect. From the platform on the top  of the mansion may be seen a perfect panorama of the surrounding  country.'    The staircase above described is here engraved. It is a remarkably  striking and elegant specimen of internal decoration, of broad and noble  proportion, and of a solid and grand construction suitable to the time  of its erection; the wood-work of the house is every where equally bold  and massive; the door-cases of simple but good design. There are some  ceilings in the first story which are in rich plaster work, ornamented  with the arms of Ireton; and mouldings of fruit and flowers, of a  sumptuous and bold enrichment.    The series of figures which stand upon the newels of the staircase are  all engraved below. There are ten remaining out of twelve, the original  number; the missing two are said to have been figures of Cromwell and  Ireton, destroyed at the Restoration. They stand about a foot in height,  and represent the different soldiers of the army, from the fifer and  drummer to the captain, and originally, to the commanders. They are  curious for more reasons than one; their locality, their truthfulness,  their history, and the picture they help us to realise of the army of  Cromwell are all so many claims on our attention.    FOOTNOTES:    [A] The custom of paying members of the House of Commons for the loss of  time and travelling expenses, was common in the seventeenth century;  constituencies believed such equivalents necessary for the attention to  their interests and wishes which a Parliamentary agent was expected to  give. In the old Corporation books of provincial towns are many entries  for payments to members of Parliament, and in some instances we find  them petitioning to Government for disfranchisement, because they could  not afford to pay the expenses of a Member.    [B] Marvel's first _expose_ of Parker's false logic was in 1672, in the  poem named above, which was immediately answered by Parker, and  re-answered by Marvel, who appears to have had some private threat sent  him, as he says his pamphlet is occasioned by two letters; one the  published 'Reproof' of him by Parker in answer to his first attack; 'the  second, left for me at a friend's house, dated November 3d, 1673,  subscribed J. G., and concluding with these words:--If thou darest to  print any lie or libel against Dr. Parker, by the Eternal--I will cut  thy throat.' This last reply of Marvel's, however, effectually silenced  Parker: 'It not only humbled Parker, but the whole party,' says Burnet,  for, 'from the king down to the tradesman, the book was read with  pleasure.'    [C] 'No stronger satire could be penned than that descriptive of the  Court of Charles, in the poem called 'Britannia and Raleigh:'--        'A colony of French possess the Court,    Pimps, priests, buffoons, in privy chambers sport;    Such slimy monsters ne'er approach'd a throne    Since Pharaoh's days, nor so defil'd a crown;    In sacred ears tyrannic arts they croak,    Pervert his mind, and good intentions choak.'    But not only do the courtiers feel the lash, for when Raleigh implores  Britannia to urge his duty on the king, and save him from the bad who  surround him, she interrupts him with--      'Raleigh, no more! for long in vain I've try'd    The Stuart from the tyrant to divide.'      [D] 'Marvel died in 1678, in his fifty-eighth year, not without the  strongest suspicions of having been poisoned; for he was always very  temperate, and of an healthful and strong constitution to the last.'    [E] On the death of this rector, however, the monument and inscription  was placed on the north wall of the church, near the spot where he is  supposed to lie.
