Examine fresh manure in the stable and see  if you can find small white maggots about half an inch long and as large  around as the lead in a pencil. If you do, place some of them with some  fresh manure in a glass jar and see what becomes of them. In a few days  the maggots will disappear and in their places small oval, brown  bean-like objects will appear. A few days later these will crack open at  one end and the fly will crawl out. Keep records of the length of time  it requires for the pest to pass from one stage to the other. If maggots  cannot be gotten put some fresh manure in the jar and catch a number of  live house flies and put them in with the manure and watch for results.  Collect a jar of fresh manure with maggots and sift over it a little  powdered borax and see what happens to the maggots. Where horse manure  can not be properly disposed of, cheap borax is used to throw over piles  of manure to destroy the maggots and prevent the flies from breeding in  it. Write a brief description of the different stages and make careful  drawings of these. Do not mistake the house fly for other flies often  found on food in the home.    Collect a few flies and put them in a bottle and drop in with them just  a few crumbs of sugar and watch them feed. They cannot chew but a little  saliva from the mouth dissolves a little of the sugar which is then  lapped up as syrup. Notice what a peculiar sucker they have for drawing  up liquids. How can they crawl along in the bottle with their backs  toward the floor? Examine the tip of their feet for a small glue pad  which sticks to the glass. These glue pads and the sucker are well  fitted for carrying filth. Examine the fly carefully and write a brief  description of it. What color is it? How many legs? How many wings? Are  these transparent? Behind the wings there is a pair of small stubs which  is all that is left of the hind pair of wings. Are the eyes large? Can  you find a pair of small feelers? Why can you not pick up a fly like you  would a grasshopper? Is their eye sight good? Why are they always most  abundant on a kitchen screen door? Can they smell?    What are the fly's worst enemies? Will the toad eat them? Do chickens  eat them? Have you ever seen chickens scratching in manure and feeding  on the fly maggots? Put a few drops of formaldehyde, which you can get  from a druggist, in a few spoonfuls of sweet milk or sugar syrup and let  the flies eat it and see what happens to them. This is one of our best  poison baits for flies which get in the home or collect about the dairy.  Formaldehyde is a poison and when used in bait it must be kept out of  reach of children. Just about frost, in the fall, watch for the  appearance of inactive flies on walls, windows and other parts of the  house. These have been attacked by a parasitic disease. These are often  found sticking to walls and other objects about the room in the winter,  and are commonly thought to be passing the winter.           *       *       *       *       *        \"_The insect we now call the 'house fly' should in the future be      termed the 'typhoid fly,' in order to call direct attention to the      danger of allowing it to continue to breed unchecked._\"                                            --L. O. HOWARD.          CHAPTER V    THE MOSQUITO      Here we have another small insect which, like the house fly, is  extremely dangerous, due to its ability to carry the germs of disease.  There are hundreds of species of mosquitoes, some small, some large. The  majority of these are unable to carry disease so far as we know at  present, but they should be avoided as dangerous. The Missouri forms  which carry disease are the so-called malarial fever mosquitoes, and  they are entirely responsible for the transmission of this sapping and  often fatal disease. In the warm countries these are more abundant and  the fever is more fatal. In the south there is still another  disease-carrying mosquito, the yellow fever mosquito. This form is most  dangerous of all.    The mosquito first bites a patient suffering with malaria and in this  way it takes in germs along with the blood which it sucks from the  patient. After these germs pass through stages of development in the  body of the mosquito they are ready to be injected back into a healthy  person where, in due time, they cause the disease. The germs feed inside  the red blood corpuscles and at regular intervals they destroy a large  number of these causing a chill which is followed by fever and a new  supply of corpuscles is produced. This alternation of chill and fever  may continue all summer, if medicine is not taken to destroy the germs.  Quinine will kill the germs if it is taken so that plenty of it is in  the blood when the germs come out of the torn down corpuscles during a  chill.    In order to prevent malarial fever, get rid of the mosquitoes by  draining and oiling the breeding places, escape their bites by screening  houses, smudging and destroying the adults, and keep the mosquitoes  from patients who have the fever. This is almost as important as the  destruction of the mosquitoes. The malarial fever mosquitoes are as  harmless as our common forms so long as they do not become infected with  germs by sucking blood from a fever patient.    [Illustration: Mosquitoes in position for biting; a, common Culex  mosquito; b, malarial fever mosquito. Note that the one stands parallel,  while the other stands at an angle to the surface on which it rests.]    In view of the fact that most of our common mosquitoes are classed as  non-dangerous, it is of interest to know just how to distinguish the  harmless ones from the dangerous. The adults of the two forms can be  easily distinguished when they are seen at rest. The common forms always  rest with the body parallel to the surface on which they rest, while the  malarial form always elevates the end of the body so that the head is  pointed toward the surface on which it rests. In like manner the  wigglers can be distinguished from each other. Our common wigglers  always hang head downward in the water while those of the malarial  mosquitoes rest near the surface of the water with their bodies parallel  to it. The majority of the wigglers found in rain barrels are of our  common forms.    [Illustration: Common Culex mosquito showing stages of development; a,  raft of eggs; b, larvae or wigglers of different sizes; c, pupa; d,  mosquito. The large wiggler and the pupa are taking air from the surface  of the water through their breathing tubes.]    The life of the mosquito is quite interesting and is an excellent  example of an insect which lives in the water part of its life and in  the air the rest. The mature female mosquito, which does all the  biting, searches for water in rain barrels, cans, ditches, ponds, and  stagnant swamps where she lays her eggs either in raft-shaped packets or  singly. When the wigglers hatch they swim about in the water and feed  upon decaying material and microscopic water plants. When the wiggler is  full grown it changes to an active pupa which has a large head and a  slender tail and is more or less coiled. A little later the winged  mosquito escapes. In the rural districts most of the mosquitoes breed in  stagnant ponds, swamps and rain barrels and from these they fly to the  home where they cause trouble. Such places should be drained or  protected with oil or other means to prevent the mosquito from using  them for breeding purposes. Ponds can be freed of the wigglers by  introducing fish or by using a small amount of coal oil on the surface.  The wigglers have a breathing tube which is thrust out above the water  when fresh air is needed and if there is a thin film of oil on the water  this is prevented. Rain barrels can be freed of the pest in this way  also, or perhaps better by covering them with a cloth. The mosquitoes  are most troublesome about the home at night. When one sits out doors he  should keep a smudge going to drive them away while screens will keep  them out of the house at night.      OBSERVATIONS AND STUDY    Collect all the different kinds of mosquitoes you can find and note  difference in size and markings. Do you find the malarial fever mosquito  in your region? Is malarial fever common during the summer and fall? Are  there any old stagnant ponds or swamps near your home? If so, examine  these for wigglers. Examine rain barrels for small raft-shaped packets  of eggs. These resemble small flakes of soot and are difficult to pick  up between your fingers. Take a stick and lift them from the water and  examine them. One packet may contain a hundred or more eggs. Put a few  of these packets in a tumbler of rain water and watch for the wigglers.  At first they will be very small but they grow fast. Watch them come to  the surface to breathe. The tip of the tail is projected above the water  and air is taken in at two small breathing pores or spiracles. Examine  rain barrels for the larger wigglers. What do they live on in the rain  barrel? What do they do when you jar the barrel? Do you find any of the  rounded pupae in the barrel? They are active the same as the wigglers.  If you find pupae, put some in a tumbler of water, cover it with cloth  or a lid and watch for the mosquitoes to appear. After collecting  several mosquitoes examine them for number of wings, legs and markings  and see if all have the slender sucking tube. The males have large  feathery feelers, but no sucking tube.    Write a brief description of the wiggler and the mosquito, their  breeding places and means of destroying them. Make drawings of the  different stages, wiggler, pupa and mosquito.

He was  good company, I won't deny it, and he had wonderful polite ways with  him for a sailor man, so that I think there must have been a time when  he knew more of the poop than the forecastle.  For a month he was in  and out of my house, and never once did it cross my mind that harm  might come of his soft, tricky ways.  And then at last something made  me suspect, and from that day my peace was gone forever.    \"'It was only a little thing, too.  I had come into the parlour  unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of welcome on  my wife's face.  But as she saw who it was it faded again, and she  turned away with a look of disappointment.  That was enough for me.  There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken  for mine.  If I could have seen him then I should have killed him, for  I have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose.  Mary saw  the devil's light in my eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my  sleeve. \"Don't, Jim, don't!\" says she.  \"Where's Sarah?\" I asked.  \"In  the kitchen,\" says she.  \"Sarah,\" says I as I went in, \"this man  Fairbairn is never to darken my door again.\"  \"Why not?\" says she.  \"Because I order it.\"  \"Oh!\" says she, \"if my friends are not good  enough for this house, then I am not good enough for it either.\"  \"You  can do what you like,\" says I, \"but if Fairbairn shows his face here  again I'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.\"  She was  frightened by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the  same evening she left my house.    \"'Well, I don't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of  this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me against my  wife by encouraging her to misbehave.  Anyway, she took a house just  two streets off and let lodgings to sailors. Fairbairn used to stay  there, and Mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him.  How often she went I don't know, but I followed her one day, and as I  broke in at the door Fairbairn got away over the back garden wall, like  the cowardly skunk that he was.  I swore to my wife that I would kill  her if I found her in his company again, and I led her back with me,  sobbing and trembling, and as white as a piece of paper.  There was no  trace of love between us any longer.  I could see that she hated me and  feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she  despised me as well.    \"'Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool, so  she went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in Croydon, and  things jogged on much the same as ever at home.  And then came this  week and all the misery and ruin.    \"'It was in this way.  We had gone on the May Day for a round voyage of  seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates, so  that we had to put back into port for twelve hours.  I left the ship  and came home, thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife, and  hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon.  The thought was  in my head as I turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab  passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two  chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching  them from the footpath.    \"'I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment I  was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I look back  on it.  I had been drinking hard of late, and the two things together  fairly turned my brain.  There's something throbbing in my head now,  like a docker's hammer, but that morning I seemed to have all Niagara  whizzing and buzzing in my ears.    \"'Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab.  I had a heavy oak  stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first; but as I ran  I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see them without being  seen.  They pulled up soon at the railway station.  There was a good  crowd round the booking-office, so I got quite close to them without  being seen.  They took tickets for New Brighton.  So did I, but I got  in three carriages behind them.  When we reached it they walked along  the Parade, and I was never more than a hundred yards from them.  At  last I saw them hire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot  day, and they thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.    \"'It was just as if they had been given into my hands.  There was a bit  of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards.  I  hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them.  I could see the blur  of their craft, but they were going nearly as fast as I, and they must  have been a long mile from the shore before I caught them up.  The haze  was like a curtain all round us, and there were we three in the middle  of it.  My God, shall I ever forget their faces when they saw who was  in the boat that was closing in upon them?  She screamed out.  He swore  like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death  in my eyes.  I got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed  his head like an egg.  I would have spared her, perhaps, for all my  madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out to him, and  calling him \"Alec.\"  I struck again, and she lay stretched beside him.  I was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood.  If Sarah had been  there, by the Lord, she should have joined them.  I pulled out my  knife, and--well, there! I've said enough.  It gave me a kind of savage  joy when I thought how Sarah would feel when she had such signs as  these of what her meddling had brought about.  Then I tied the bodies  into the boat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk.  I knew  very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings  in the haze, and had drifted off out to sea.  I cleaned myself up, got  back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of  what had passed.  That night I made up the packet for Sarah Cushing,  and next day I sent it from Belfast.    \"'There you have the whole truth of it.  You can hang me, or do what  you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished  already.  I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at  me--staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze.  I killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have  another night of it I shall be either mad or dead before morning.  You  won't put me alone into a cell, sir?  For pity's sake don't, and may  you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.'      \"What is the meaning of it, Watson?\" said Holmes solemnly as he laid  down the paper.  \"What object is served by this circle of misery and  violence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else our universe is  ruled by chance, which is unthinkable.  But what end?  There is the  great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from  an answer as ever.\""]]]
