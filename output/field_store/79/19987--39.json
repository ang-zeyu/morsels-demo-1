Inasmuch as without their aid the  orchid must perish from its inability to set fertile seed, no  wonder it woos its benefactors with a showy mass of color,  charming fringes, sweet perfume, and copious draughts of nectar,  and makes their visits of the utmost value to itself by the  ingenious mechanism described above. Here is no waste of pollen;  that is snugly packed in little bundles, ready to be carried off,  but placed where they cannot come in contact with the adjoining  stigma, since every orchid, almost without exception, refuses to  be deteriorated through self-fertilization.    >From New Jersey and Illinois southward, particularly in  mountainous regions, if not among the mountains themselves, the  FRINGELESS PURPLE ORCHIS (H. perarnoena) may be found blooming in  moist meadows through July and August. Moisture, from which to  manufacture the nectar that orchids rely upon so largely to  entice insects to work for them, is naturally a prime necessity;  yet Sprengel attempted to prove that many orchids are gaudy shams  and produce no nectar, but exist by an organized system of  deception. \"Scheinsaftblumen\" he called them. From the number of  butterflies seen hovering about this fringeless orchis and its  more attractive kin, it is small wonder their nectaries are soon  exhausted and they are accused of being gay deceivers. Sprengel's  much-quoted theory would credit moths, butterflies, and even the  highly intelligent bees with scant sense; but Darwin, who  thoroughly tested it, forever exonerated these insects from  imputed stupidity and the flowers from gross dishonesty. He found  that many European orchids secrete their nectar between the outer  and inner walls of the tube, which a bumblebee can easily pierce,  but where Sprengel never thought to look for it. The large lip of  this orchis is not fringed, but has a fine picotee edge. The  showy violet-purple, long-spurred flowers are alternately set on  a stem that is doing its best if it reach a height of two and a  half feet.      WATER-SHIELD or WATER TARGET    (Brasenia purpurea; B. peltata of Gray)  Water-lily family    Flowers - Small, dull purplish, about 1/2 in. across, on stout  footstalks from axils of upper leaves; 3 narrow sepals and  petals; stamens 12 to 18; pistils 4 to 18, forming 1 to 3-seeded  pods. Stem: From submerged rootstock; slender, branching, several  feet long, covered with clear jelly, as are footstalks and lower  leaf surfaces. Leaves: On long petioles attached to center of  underside of leaf, floating or rising, oval to roundish, 2 to 4  in. long, 1 1/2 to 2 in. wide.  Preferred Habitat - Still, rather deep water of ponds and slow  streams.  Flowering Season - All summer.  Distribution - Parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia, Nova Scotia  to Cuba, and westward from California to Puget Sound.    Of this pretty water plant Dr. Abbott says, in \"Wasteland  Wanderings\": \"I gathered a number of floating, delicate leaves,  and endeavored to secure the entire stem also; but this was too  difficult a task for an August afternoon. The under side of the  stem and leaf are purplish brown and were covered with  translucent jelly, embedded in which were millions of what I took  to be insects' eggs. They certainly had that appearance. I was  far more interested to find that, usually, beneath each leaf  there was hiding a little pike. The largest was not two inches in  length. When disturbed, they swam a few inches, and seemed wholly  'at sea' if there was not another leaf near by to afford them  shelter.\"      EUROPEAN or COMMON GARDEN COLUMBINE    (Aquilegia vulgaris)  Crowfoot family    Flowers - Showy, blue, purple, or white, 1 1/2 to 2 in. broad, or  about as broad as long; spurs stout and strongly incurved.  General characteristics of plant resembling wild columbine.  Preferred Habitat - Escaped from gardens to woods and fields in  Eastern and Middle States. Native of Europe.  Flowering Season - May-July.    A heavier, less graceful flower than either the wild red and  yellow columbine or the exquisite, long-spurred, blue and white  species (A. coerulea) of the Rocky Mountain region; nevertheless  this European immigrant, now making itself at home here, is a  charming addition to our flora. How are insects to reach the well  of nectar secreted in the tip of its incurved, hooked spur?  Certain of the long-lipped bees, large bumblebees, whose tongues  have developed as rapidly as the flower, are able to drain it.  Hummingbirds, partial to red flowers, fertilize the wild  columbine, but let this one alone. Muller watched a female  bumblebee making several vain attempts to sip this blue one. Soon  the brilliant idea of biting a hole through each spur flashed  through her little brain, and the first experiment proving  delightfully successful, she proceeded to bite holes through  other flowers without first trying to suck them. Apparently she  satisfied her feminine conscience with the reflection that the  flower which made dining so difficult for its benefactors  deserved no better treatment.      FIELD or BRANCHED LARKSPUR; KNIGHT'S-SPUR; LARK-HEEL    (Delphinium Consoilda)  Crowfoot family    Flowers - Blue to pinkish and whitish, 1 to 1 1/2 in. long, hung  on slender stems and scattered along spreading branches; 5  petal-like sepals, the rear one prolonged into long, slender,  curving spur; 2 petals, united. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high.  Leaves: Divided into very finely cut linear segments. Fruit:  Erect, smooth pod tipped with a short beak; open on one side.  Preferred Habitat - Roadsides and fields.  Flowering Season - June-August.  Distribution - Naturalized from Europe; from New Jersey  southward, occasionally escaped from gardens farther north.    Keats should certainly have extolled the larkspurs in his sonnet  on blue. No more beautiful group of plants contributes to the  charm of gardens, woods, and roadsides, where some have escaped  cultivation and become naturalized, than the delphinium, that  take their name from a fancied resemblance to a dolphin  (delphin), given them by Linnaeus in one of his wild flights of  imagination. Having lost the power to fertilize themselves,  according to Muller, they are pollenized by both bees and  butterflies, insects whose tongues have kept pace with the  development of certain flowers, such as the larkspur, columbine,  and violet, that they may reach into the deep recesses of the  spurs where the nectar is hidden from all but benefactors.    The TALL WILD LARKSPUR (D. urceolatum; D. exaltatum of Gray)  waves long, crowded, downy wands of intense purplish blue in the  rich woods of Western Pennsylvania, southward to the Carolinas  and Alabama, and westward to Nebraska. Its spur is nearly  straight, not to increase the difficulty a bee must have in  pressing his lips through the upper and lower petals to reach the  nectar at the end of it. First, the stamens successively raise  themselves in the passage back of the petals to dust his head;  then, when each has shed its pollen and bent down again, the  pistil takes its turn in occupying the place, so that a  pollen-laden bee, coming to visit the blossom from an earlier  flower; can scarcely help fertilizing it. It is said there are  but two insects in Europe with lips long enough to reach the  bottom of the long horn of plenty hung by the BEE LARKSPUR (D.  elatum), that we know only in gardens here. Its yellowish bearded  lower petals readily deceive one into thinking a bee has just  alighted there.    >From April to June the DWARF LARKSPUR or STAGGER-WEED (D.  tricorne), which, however, may sometimes grow three feet high,  lifts a loose raceme of blue, rarely white, flowers an inch or  more long, at the end of a stout stem rising from a tuberous  root. Its slightly ascending spur, its three widely spreading  seed vessels, and the deeply cut leaf of from five to seven  divisions are distinguishing characteristics. From Western  Pennsylvania and Georgia to Arkansas and Minnesota it is found in  rather stiff soil. Butterflies, which prefer erect flowers, have  some difficulty to cling while they drain the almost upright  spurs, especially the Papilios, which usually suck with their  wings in motion. But the bees, to which the delphinium are best  adapted, although butterflies visit them quite as frequently,  find a convenient landing place prepared for them, and fertilize  the flower while they sip with ease.    More slender, downy, and dwarf of stem than the preceding is the  CAROLINA LARKSPUR (D. Carolinianum), whose blue flowers, varying  to white, and its very finely cleft leaves, may be found in the  South, on prairies in the North and West, and in the Rocky  Mountain region.      LIVER-LEAF; HEPATICA; LIVERWORT; ROUND-LOBED or KIDNEY  LIVER-LEAF; NOBLE LIVER-WORT; SQUIRREL CUP    (Hepalica Hepatica; H. triloba of Gray)  Crowfoot family    Flowers - Blue, lavender, purple, pinkish, or white;  occasionally, not always, fragrant; 6 to 12 petal-like, colored  sepals (not petals, as they appear to be), oval or oblong;  numerous stamens, all bearing anthers; pistils numerous 3 small,  sessile leaves, forming an involucre directly under flower,  simulate a calyx, for which they might be mistaken. Stems:  Spreading from the root, 4 to 6 in. high, a solitary flower or  leaf borne at end of each furry stem. Leaves: 3-lobed and  rounded, leathery, evergreen; sometimes mottled with, or  entirely, reddish purple; spreading on ground, rusty at blooming  time, the new leaves appearing after the flowers. Fruit: Usually  as many as pistils, dry, 1-seeded, oblong, sharply pointed, never  opening.  Preferred Habitat - Woods; light soil on hillsides.  Flowering Season - December-May.  Distribution - Canada to Northern Florida, Manitoba to Iowa and  Missouri. Most common East.

Some of their ideas were curiously  logical and at the same time comic. There was, for example, a  priest, Le Pere Galien of Avignon. He observed that the rarified air  at the summit of the Alps was vastly lighter than that in the  valleys below. What then was to hinder carrying up empty sacks of  cotton or oiled silk to the mountain tops, opening them to the  lighter air of the upper ranges, and sealing them hermetically when  filled by it. When brought down into the valleys they would have  lifting power enough to carry tons up to the summits again. The good  Father's education in physics was not sufficiently advanced to warn  him that the effort to drag the balloons down into the valley would  exact precisely the force they would exert in lifting any load out  of the valley--if indeed they possessed any lifting power  whatsoever, which is exceedingly doubtful.    Another project, which sounded logical enough, was based on the  irrefutable truth that as air has some weight--to be exact 14.70  pounds for a column one inch square and the height of the earth's  atmosphere--a vacuum must be lighter, as it contains nothing, not  even air. Accordingly in the seventeenth century, one Francisco  Lana, another priest, proposed to build an airship supported by four  globes of copper, very thin and light, from which all the air had  been pumped. The globes were to be twenty feet in diameter, and were  estimated to have a lifting force of 2650 pounds. The weight of the  copper shells was put at 1030 pounds, leaving a margin of possible  weight for the car and its contents of 1620 pounds. It seemed at  first glance a perfectly reasonable and logical plan. Unhappily one  factor in the problem had been ignored. The atmospheric pressure on  each of the globes would be about 1800 tons. Something more than a  thin copper shell would be needed to resist this crushing force and  an adequate increase in the strength of the shells would so enhance  their weight as to destroy their lifting power.    [Illustration: Lana's Vacuum Balloon.]    To tell at length the stories of attempt and failure of the earliest  dabblers in aeronautics would be unprofitable and uninteresting. Not  until the eighteenth century did the experimenters with  lighter-than-air devices show any practical results. Not until the  twentieth century did the advocates of the heavier-than-air machines  show the value of their fundamental idea. The former had to discover  a gaseous substance actually lighter, and much lighter, than the  surrounding atmosphere before they could make headway. The latter  were compelled to abandon wholly the effort to imitate the flapping  of a bird's wings, and study rather the method by which the bird  adjusts the surface of its wings to the wind and soars without  apparent effort, before they could show the world any promising  results.    Nearly every step forward in applied science is accomplished because  of the observation by some thoughtful mind of some common phenomenon  of nature, and the later application of those observations to some  useful purpose.    It seems a far cry from an ancient Greek philosopher reposing  peacefully in his bath to a modern Zeppelin, but the connection is  direct. Every schoolboy knows the story of the sudden dash of  Archimedes, stark and dripping from his tub, with the triumphant cry  of \"Eureka!\"--\"I have found it!\" What he had found was the rule  which governed the partial flotation of his body in water. Most of  us observe it, but the philosophical mind alone inquired \"Why?\"  Archimedes' answer was this rule which has become a fundamental of  physics: \"A body plunged into a fluid is subjected by this fluid to  a pressure from below to above equal to the weight of the fluid  displaced by the body.\" A balloon is plunged in the air--a fluid. If  it is filled with air there is no upward pressure from below, but if  it is filled with a gas lighter than air there is a pressure upward  equal to the difference between the weight of that gas and that of  an equal quantity of air. Upon that fact rests the whole theory and  practice of ballooning.    The illustration of James Watt watching the steam rattle the cover  of a teapot and from it getting the rudimentary idea of the steam  engine is another case in point. Sometimes however the application  of the hints of nature to the needs of man is rather ludicrously  indirect. Charles Lamb gravely averred that because an early  Chinaman discovered that the flesh of a pet pig, accidentally  roasted in the destruction by fire of his owner's house, proved  delicious to the palate, the Chinese for years made a practice of  burning down their houses to get roast pig with \"crackling.\" Early  experimenters in aviation observed that birds flapped their wings  and flew. Accordingly they believed that man to fly must have wings  and flap them likewise. Not for hundreds of years did they observe  that most birds flapped their wings only to get headway, or  altitude, thereafter soaring to great heights and distances merely  by adjusting the angle of their wings to the various currents of air  they encountered.    In a similar way the earliest experimenters with balloons observed  that smoke always ascended. \"Let us fill a light envelope with  smoke,\" said they, \"and it will rise into the air bearing a burden  with it.\" All of which was true enough, and some of the first  balloonists cast upon their fires substances like sulphur and pitch  in order to produce a thicker smoke, which they believed had greater  lifting power than ordinary hot air.    In the race for actual accomplishment the balloonists, the advocates  of lighter-than-air machines, took the lead at first. It is  customary and reasonable to discard as fanciful the various devices  and theories put forward by the experimenters in the Middle Ages and  fix the beginning of practical aeronautical devices with the  invention of hot-air balloons by the Montgolfiers, of Paris, in  1783.    The Montgolfier brothers, Joseph and Jacques, were paper-makers of  Paris. The family had long been famous for its development of the  paper trade, and the many ingenious uses to which they put its  staple. Just as the tanners of the fabled town in the Middle Ages  thought there was \"nothing like leather\" with which to build its  walls and gates, thereby giving a useful phrase to literature, so  the Montgolfiers thought of everything in terms of paper. Sitting by  their big open fireplace one night, so runs the story, they noticed  the smoke rushing up the chimney. \"Why not fill a big paper bag with  smoke and make it lift objects into the air?\" cried one. The  experiment was tried next day with a small bag and proved a complete  success. A neighbouring housewife looked in, and saw the bag bumping  about the ceiling, but rapidly losing its buoyancy as the smoke  escaped.    [Illustration: Montgolfier's Experimental Balloon.]    \"Why not fasten a pan below the mouth of the bag,\" said she, \"and  put your fire in that? Its weight will keep the bag upright, and  when it rises will carry the smoke and the pan up with it.\"    Acting upon the hint the brothers fixed up a small bag which sailed  up into the air beyond recapture. After various experiments a bag of  mixed paper and linen thirty-five feet in diameter was inflated and  released. It soared to a height of six thousand feet, and drifted  before the wind a mile or more before descending. The ascent took  place at Avonay, the home at the time of the Montgolfiers, and as  every sort of publicity was given in advance, a huge assemblage  including many officials of high estate gathered to witness it. A  roaring fire was built in a pit over the mouth of which eight men  held the great sack, which rolled, and beat about before the wind as  it filled and took the form of a huge ball. The crowd was  unbelieving and cynical, inclined to scoff at the idea that mere  smoke would carry so huge a construction up into the sky. But when  the signal was given to cast off, the balloon rose with a swiftness  and majesty that at first struck the crowd dumb, then moved it to  cheers of amazement and admiration. It went up six thousand feet and  the Montgolfiers were at once elevated to almost an equal height of  fame. The crowd which watched the experiment was wild with  enthusiasm; the Montgolfiers elated with the first considerable  victory over the force of gravity. They had demonstrated a principle  and made their names immortal. What remained was to develop that  principle and apply it to practical ends. That development, however,  proceeded for something more than a century before anything like a  practical airship was constructed.    But for the moment the attack on the forces which had kept the air  virgin territory to man was not allowed to lag. In Paris public  subscriptions were opened to defray the cost of a new and greater  balloon. By this time it was known that hydrogen gas, or  \"inflammable air\" as it was then called, was lighter than air. But  its manufacture was then expensive and public aid was needed for the  new experiment which would call at the outset for a thousand pounds  of iron filings and 498 pounds of sulphuric acid wherewith to  manufacture the gas.    The first experiment had been made in the provinces. This one was  set for Paris, and in an era when the French capital was  intellectually more alert, more eager for novelty, more interested  in the advancement of physical science and in new inventions than  ever in its long history of hospitality to the new idea. They began  to fill the bag August 23, 1783 in the _Place des Victoires_, but  the populace so thronged that square that two days later it was  moved half filled to Paris's most historic point, the _Champ de  Mars_. The transfer was made at midnight through the narrow dark  streets of mediaeval Paris. Eyewitnesses have left descriptions of  the scene. Torch-bearers lighted on its way the cortege"]]]
