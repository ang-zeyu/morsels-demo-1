One sagaciously sat down in a corner with  her back to the window, and held her fingers to her ears; a second knelt  down before her, and hid her face in her lap; a third threw herself  between them, and embraced her sister with a thousand tears; some  insisted on going home; others, unconscious of their actions, wanted  sufficient presence of mind to repress the impertinence of their young  partners, who sought to direct to themselves those sighs which the lips  of our agitated beauties intended for heaven. Some of the gentlemen had  gone down-stairs to smoke a quiet cigar, and the rest of the company  gladly embraced a happy suggestion of the hostess to retire into another  room which was provided with shutters and curtains. We had hardly got  there, when Charlotte placed the chairs in a circle; and, when the  company had sat down in compliance with her request, she forthwith  proposed a round game.    I noticed some of the company prepare their mouths and draw themselves  up at the prospect of some agreeable forfeit. \"Let us play at counting,\"  said Charlotte. \"Now, pay attention: I shall go round the circle from  right to left; and each person is to count, one after the other, the  number that comes to him, and must count fast; whoever stops or  mistakes is to have a box on the ear, and so on, till we have counted a  thousand.\" It was delightful to see the fun. She went round the circle  with upraised arm. \"One,\" said the first; \"two,\" the second; \"three,\"  the third; and so on, till Charlotte went faster and faster. One made a  mistake, instantly a box on the ear; and, amid the laughter that ensued,  came another box; and so on, faster and faster. I myself came in for  two. I fancied they were harder than the rest, and felt quite delighted.  A general laughter and confusion put an end to the game long before  we had counted as far as a thousand. The party broke up into little  separate knots: the storm had ceased, and I followed Charlotte into the  ballroom. On the way she said, \"The game banished their fears of the  storm.\" I could make no reply. \"I myself,\" she continued, \"was as much  frightened as any of them; but by affecting courage, to keep up the  spirits of the others, I forgot my apprehensions.\" We went to the  window. It was still thundering at a distance: a soft rain was pouring  down over the country, and filled the air around us with delicious  odours. Charlotte leaned forward on her arm; her eyes wandered over the  scene; she raised them to the sky, and then turned them upon me;  they were moistened with tears; she placed her hand on mine and said,  \"Klopstock!\" at once I remembered the magnificent ode which was in her  thoughts: I felt oppressed with the weight of my sensations, and sank  under them. It was more than I could bear. I bent over her hand, kissed  it in a stream of delicious tears, and again looked up to her eyes.  Divine Klopstock! why didst thou not see thy apotheosis in those eyes?  And thy name so often profaned, would that I never heard it repeated!    JUNE 19.    I no longer remember where I stopped in my narrative: I only know it was  two in the morning when I went to bed; and if you had been with me,  that I might have talked instead of writing to you, I should, in all  probability, have kept you up till daylight.    I think I have not yet related what happened as we rode home from  the ball, nor have I time to tell you now. It was a most magnificent  sunrise: the whole country was refreshed, and the rain fell drop by  drop from the trees in the forest. Our companions were asleep. Charlotte  asked me if I did not wish to sleep also, and begged of me not to make  any ceremony on her account. Looking steadfastly at her, I answered, \"As  long as I see those eyes open, there is no fear of my falling asleep.\"  We both continued awake till we reached her door. The maid opened it  softly, and assured her, in answer to her inquiries, that her father and  the children were well, and still sleeping. I left her asking permission  to visit her in the course of the day. She consented, and I went, and,  since that time, sun, moon, and stars may pursue their course: I know  not whether it is day or night; the whole world is nothing to me.    JUNE 21.    My days are as happy as those reserved by God for his elect; and,  whatever be my fate hereafter, I can never say that I have not tasted  joy,--the purest joy of life. You know Walheim. I am now completely  settled there. In that spot I am only half a league from Charlotte; and  there I enjoy myself, and taste all the pleasure which can fall to the  lot of man.    Little did I imagine, when I selected Walheim for my pedestrian  excursions, that all heaven lay so near it. How often in my wanderings  from the hillside or from the meadows across the river, have I beheld  this hunting-lodge, which now contains within it all the joy of my  heart!    I have often, my dear Wilhelm, reflected on the eagerness men feel to  wander and make new discoveries, and upon that secret impulse which  afterward inclines them to return to their narrow circle, conform to  the laws of custom, and embarrass themselves no longer with what passes  around them.    It is so strange how, when I came here first, and gazed upon that  lovely valley from the hillside, I felt charmed with the entire scene  surrounding me. The little wood opposite--how delightful to sit under  its shade! How fine the view from that point of rock! Then, that  delightful chain of hills, and the exquisite valleys at their feet!  Could I but wander and lose myself amongst them! I went, and returned  without finding what I wished. Distance, my friend, is like futurity. A  dim vastness is spread before our souls: the perceptions of our mind are  as obscure as those of our vision; and we desire earnestly to surrender  up our whole being, that it may be filled with the complete and perfect  bliss of one glorious emotion. But alas! when we have attained our  object, when the distant there becomes the present here, all is changed:  we are as poor and circumscribed as ever, and our souls still languish  for unattainable happiness.    So does the restless traveller pant for his native soil, and find in his  own cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the affections of his children,  and in the labour necessary for their support, that happiness which he  had sought in vain through the wide world.    When, in the morning at sunrise, I go out to Walheim, and with my own  hands gather in the garden the pease which are to serve for my dinner,  when I sit down to shell them, and read my Homer during the intervals,  and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen, fetch my own butter,  put my mess on the fire, cover it up, and sit down to stir it as  occasion requires, I figure to myself the illustrious suitors of  Penelope, killing, dressing, and preparing their own oxen and swine.  Nothing fills me with a more pure and genuine sense of happiness than  those traits of patriarchal life which, thank Heaven! I can imitate  without affectation. Happy is it, indeed, for me that my heart is  capable of feeling the same simple and innocent pleasure as the peasant  whose table is covered with food of his own rearing, and who not only  enjoys his meal, but remembers with delight the happy days and sunny  mornings when he planted it, the soft evenings when he watered it, and  the pleasure he experienced in watching its daily growth.    JUNE 29.    The day before yesterday, the physician came from the town to pay a  visit to the judge. He found me on the floor playing with Charlotte's  children. Some of them were scrambling over me, and others romped with  me; and, as I caught and tickled them, they made a great noise. The  doctor is a formal sort of personage: he adjusts the plaits of his  ruffles, and continually settles his frill whilst he is talking to you;  and he thought my conduct beneath the dignity of a sensible man. I could  perceive this by his countenance. But I did not suffer myself to be  disturbed. I allowed him to continue his wise conversation, whilst I  rebuilt the children's card houses for them as fast as they threw them  down. He went about the town afterward, complaining that the judge's  children were spoiled enough before, but that now Werther was completely  ruining them.    Yes, my dear Wilhelm, nothing on this earth affects my heart so much  as children. When I look on at their doings; when I mark in the little  creatures the seeds of all those virtues and qualities which they will  one day find so indispensable; when I behold in the obstinate all the  future firmness and constancy of a noble character; in the capricious,  that levity and gaiety of temper which will carry them lightly over  the dangers and troubles of life, their whole nature simple and  unpolluted,--then I call to mind the golden words of the Great Teacher  of mankind, \"Unless ye become like one of these!\" And now, my friend,  these children, who are our equals, whom we ought to consider as our  models, we treat them as though they were our subjects. They are allowed  no will of their own. And have we, then, none ourselves? Whence comes  our exclusive right? Is it because we are older and more experienced?  Great God! from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest great children  and little children, and no others; and thy Son has long since declared  which afford thee greatest pleasure. But they believe in him, and hear  him not,--that, too, is an old story; and they train their children  after their own image, etc.    Adieu, Wilhelm: I will not further bewilder myself with this subject.    JULY 1.    The consolation Charlotte can bring to an invalid I experience from my  own heart, which suffers more from her absence than many a poor creature  lingering on a bed of sickness. She is gone to spend a few days in the  town with a very worthy woman, who is given over by the physicians, and  wishes to have Charlotte near "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25281"],[0,"Briefless Ballads and Legal Lyrics (#5)"],[1," is--to die![L]    [L] The decision was to the effect that in most cases an action for  breach of promise of marriage does not survive against the  representatives of the promiser.      POLLARD _v._ PHOTOGRAPHIC COMPANY    (40 Chancery Division, 345)        \"Shall I take your photograph, my pretty maid?\"      \"You may if you like, kind sir,\" she said.        \"Do you like your photograph, my pretty maid?\"      \"It is more than flattering, sir,\" she said.        \"I'll publish your photograph, my pretty maid.\"      \"Indeed but you won't, kind sir,\" she said.        \"As a Christmas card, my pretty maid.\"      \"The very idea, kind sir!\" she said.        \"But what if I've done it, my pretty maid?\"      \"I'll get an injunction, sir,\" she said.        \"The law is with you, my pretty maid,\"      The learned judge of the Chancery said.        \"You have proved the negative, my pretty maid,      A difficult thing in law,\" he said.      THE MINNEAPOLIS CASE    (_Tried in Minnesota in 1892_)        Kind reader, tarry here, nor miss      The law of Minneapolis.      There was a carpenter called Brown,      A citizen of that great town,      Who stood his \"inexpressive she\"      A dollar's worth of comedy.      Was it a Gaiety burlesque,      Or labour of Norwegian desk?      Or did they spout in stagey tones      Morality by H. A. Jones?      Or tear romance to rags and set it      In heavy platitudes by Pettit?      I know not, and it matters not,      The subject I have clean forgot.      Sufficient that the pair did sit      In expectation in the pit,      An expectation not fulfilled,      'Twas otherwise by fortune willed.      Before this loving couple sat      In solitary state a hat--      A hat, I say, for in their wonder      They never noticed what was under,      The wearer must have been a \"human,\"      But might have been a man or woman.      'Twas like a mountain crowned with trees      Amid the pathless Pyrenees,      Or like a garden planned by Paxton,      Or colophon designed by Caxton,      So intricate the work; and flowers      Were trained to climb its soaring towers,      Convolvulus and candytuft,      And 'mid them water-wagtails stuffed.      Such splendour never yet, I wis,      Had shone in Minneapolis.      But Brown was in a sore dilemma,      A dollar he had paid for Emma      To see a play, and not a hat;      A dollar, it was dear at that.      And Emma--disappointment racked her,      She never saw a single actor.      So Brown, with visage thunder-black,      Demanded both his dollars back.      The man who took the cash said, \"Sonny,      Our rule is not to give back money.      But if you'll come another night,      Maybe you'll get a better sight.\"      So Brown went home and nursed his sorrow,      His writ he issued on the morrow.      A hundred dollars was his claim,      And the young lady claimed the same.      The case was argued, on revision      Of pleadings, this was the decision:      \"The theatre's defence is bad,      Brown paid for what he never had,      He paid when in the pit he sat      To see a play and not a hat.      To bring defendants to their senses,      I find for plaintiffs with expenses.\"      _Justitiae columna sis_,      Wise judge of Minneapolis!      COMMONWEALTH _v._ MARZYNSKI    (21 New England Reports, 228 [Massachusetts, 1893])        [On a complaint for keeping open a tobacconist's shop on Sunday,      contrary to the law of Massachusetts, it was held that the court      will take judicial notice that tobacco and cigars are not drugs and      medicines, and will exclude the testimony of a witness who offers      evidence that they are.]        Against the statutes of the Old Bay State        Marzynski on a Sunday stood behind        His counter, well content his gain to find        In pipes not pills, cigars not carbonate.      From breakfast till 'twas dusk at half-past eight        Tobacco cheered this hardened sinner's mind,        The price of it his pockets, disinclined        To add their dime to the collection plate.      The State Attorney claimed the penalty;        \"Cigars are no cigars,\" said the defence,        \"But drugs, and we have witnesses to prove it.\"      \"Cigars to be cigars judicially        We notice, and reject the evidence.\"        So said the Court, and spat, and nought could move it.

So say old saws, my own in aid I crave;      Woe to the court whose judge once spake for fees,      Though he were readier than Isocrates!      An advocate that pleaded once for pelf      Scarce on the bench forgets his former self.                                      _Palladas._      XI. 75        This Olympicus of old      Had, Sebastus, I am told      Quite his share of upper gear,      Nose and chin and eye and ear.      All he lost, and by his fist--      He became a pugilist.      Loss of members with it drew      Loss of patrimony too.      When his birthright he would claim,      Into court his brother came      With a portrait, saying, \"Thus      Looked the old Olympicus.\"      None could any likeness see,      Disinherited was he.                                      _Lucillus._      XI. 141        A pig, a goat, an ox I lost:      I want them back at any cost,      And so retained, O woful fate!      Menecles for my advocate.      But tell me, will you, what have these      In common with Othryades?      The heroes of Thermopylae      Have nought to do with theft from me.      Against Eutychides I bring      My action for a trivial thing.      Let Xerxes rest a little space,      And leave the Spartans in their place.      For if you don't put all this by      I'll go into the streets and cry,      \"The voice of Menecles is big,      But what about my stolen pig?\"                                      _Lucillus._        [This Epigram is probably an imitation of that of Martial, on p.      90.]      XI. 143        Pluto rejected at his gate      The soul of Mark the advocate;      \"No, Cerberus my dog,\" quoth he,      \"Will make you pleasant company;      But if within you needs must go,      Practise on poet Melito,      And you shall have, if he won't do,      Tityus and Ixion too.      You'll be to hell the sorest ill      Of all that hell contains, until      There come to us worse barbarisms      When Rufus speaks his solecisms.\"                                      _Lucillus._      XI. 147        So soon hath Asiaticus        The gift of eloquence achieved?

And why? The statue cannot speak a word, no more could he.                                      _Anon._      XI. 152        Paul, dost thou wish to make thy boy        An advocate like these his betters?      Then let him not his time employ        To useless ends in learning letters.                                      _Ammianus._      XI. 251        The parties were as deaf as deaf could be,      The judge was far the deafest of the three.      Said plaintiff, \"Sir, I ask for five months' rent.\"      Defendant, \"Grinding corn all night I spent.\"      \"Why,\" quoth the judge, \"dispute? Your mother's claim      Is good, and you must both support the dame.\"                                      _Nicarchus._      XI. 350        Remember justice and her yoke, and know      That 'gainst the wicked votes of \"Guilty\" go.      Thou trustest in thy cunning speech, thy power      Of speaking words that vary with the hour.      Hope what thou wilt, thy trifling tricks are vain,      Thou canst not make the path of law less plain.                                      _Agathias._      XI. 376        Once to Diodorus came a client in a state of doubt,      And to that most learned counsel thus he set the matter out:      \"Alpha Beta found a slave-girl who had run away from me:      To a slave of his he wed her, though she was my property,      Well he knew she was my chattel; she has had a child or two;      Now I cannot tell for certain whose the children are, can you?\"      Diodorus thought, consulted all authorities on \"Slave,\"      To his client turned his furrowed brows and slowly answer gave:      \"'Tis to you or to the other who, you say, has done you wrong,      That the children of the handmaid rightfully of course belong,      Your best plan will be the matter in the proper court to place,      So you'll get a good opinion whether you have any case.\"                                      _Agathias._      PLAN, 193        \"Good Hermes, only just one cabbage plant.\"      \"Stop, stop, my thieving traveller, you can't.\"      \"What, grudge me one poor cabbage! is it so?\"      \"Nay, I don't grudge it, but the law says no.      The law says, Keep your itching palms, d'ye see,      From meddling with another's property.\"      \"Well, this beats anything I ever saw!
