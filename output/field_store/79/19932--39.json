The first day he came, he chopped the top off one finger in the  hay-cutter, and during the week, fell from the shed roof, was chased by  an angry hen who tried to pick his out because he examined her chickens,  got run away with, and had his ears boxed violent by Asia, who caught  him luxuriously skimming a pan of cream with half a stolen pie.  Undaunted, however, by any failures or rebuffs, this indomitable youth  went on amusing himself with all sorts of tricks till no one felt safe.  If he did not know his lessons, he always had some droll excuse to  offer, and as he was usually clever at his books, and as bright as a  button in composing answers when he did not know them, he go on pretty  well at school. But out of school, Ye gods and little fishes! how Tommy  did carouse!    He wound fat Asia up in her own clothes line against the post, and left  here there to fume and scold for half an hour one busy Monday morning.  He dropped a hot cent down Mary Ann's back as that pretty maid was  waiting at table one day when there were gentlemen to dinner, whereat  the poor girl upset the soup and rushed out of the room in dismay,  leaving the family to think that she had gone mad. He fixed a pail of  water up in a tree, with a bit of ribbon fastened to the handle, and  when Daisy, attracted by the gay streamer, tried to pull it down, she  got a douche bath that spoiled her clean frock and hurt her little  feelings very much. He put rough white pebbles in the sugar-bowl when  his grandmother came to tea, and the poor old lady wondered why they  didn't melt in her cup, but was too polite to say anything. He passed  around snuff in church so that five of the boys sneezed with such  violence they had to go out. He dug paths in winter time, and then  privately watered them so that people should tumble down. He drove poor  Silas nearly wild by hanging his big boots in conspicuous places,  for his feet were enormous, and he was very much ashamed of them. He  persuaded confiding little Dolly to tie a thread to one of his loose  teeth, and leave the string hanging from his mouth when he went to  sleep, so that Tommy could pull it out without his feeling the dreaded  operation. But the tooth wouldn't come at the first tweak, and poor  Dolly woke up in great anguish of spirit, and lost all faith in Tommy  from that day forth.    The last prank had been to give the hens bread soaked in rum, which made  them tipsy and scandalized all the other fowls, for the respectable old  biddies went staggering about, pecking and clucking in the most maudlin  manner, while the family were convulsed with laughter at their antics,  till Daisy took pity on them and shut them up in the hen-house to sleep  off their intoxication.    These were the boys and they lived together as happy as twelve lads  could, studying and playing, working and squabbling, fighting faults and  cultivating virtues in the good old-fashioned way. Boys at other schools  probably learned more from books, but less of that better wisdom which  makes good men. Latin, Greek, and mathematics were all very well, but in  Professor Bhaer's opinion, self knowledge, self-help, and self-control  were more important, and he tried to teach them carefully. People shook  their heads sometimes at his ideas, even while they owned that the boys  improved wonderfully in manners and morals. But then, as Mrs. Jo said to  Nat, \"it was an odd school.\"        CHAPTER III. SUNDAY    The moment the bell rang next morning Nat flew out of bed, and dressed  himself with great satisfaction in the suit of clothes he found on  the chair. They were not new, being half-worn garments of one of the  well-to-do boys; but Mrs. Bhaer kept all such cast-off feathers for the  picked robins who strayed into her nest. They were hardly on when Tommy  appeared in a high state of clean collar, and escorted Nat down to  breakfast.    The sun was shining into the dining-room on the well-spread table, and  the flock of hungry, hearty lads who gathered round it. Nat observed  that they were much more orderly than they had been the night before,  and every one stood silently behind his chair while little Rob, standing  beside his father at the head of the table, folded his hands, reverently  bent his curly head, and softly repeated a short grace in the devout  German fashion, which Mr. Bhaer loved and taught his little son to  honor. Then they all sat down to enjoy the Sunday-morning breakfast of  coffee, steak, and baked potatoes, instead of the bread and milk fare  with which they usually satisfied their young appetites. There was much  pleasant talk while the knives and forks rattled briskly, for certain  Sunday lessons were to be learned, the Sunday walk settled, and plans  for the week discussed. As he listened, Nat thought it seemed as if this  day must be a very pleasant one, for he loved quiet, and there was  a cheerful sort of hush over every thing that pleased him very much;  because, in spite of his rough life, the boy possessed the sensitive  nerves which belong to a music-loving nature.    \"Now, my lads, get your morning jobs done, and let me find you ready  for church when the 'bus comes round,\" said Father Bhaer, and set the  example by going into the school-room to get books ready for the morrow.    Every one scattered to his or her task, for each had some little daily  duty, and was expected to perform it faithfully. Some brought wood and  water, brushed the steps, or ran errands for Mrs. Bhaer. Others fed the  pet animals, and did chores about the barn with Franz. Daisy washed the  cups, and Demi wiped them, for the twins liked to work together, and  Demi had been taught to make himself useful in the little house at home.  Even Baby Teddy had his small job to do, and trotted to and fro, putting  napkins away, and pushing chairs into their places. For half and hour  the lads buzzed about like a hive of bees, then the 'bus drove round,  Father Bhaer and Franz with the eight older boys piled in, and away they  went for a three-mile drive to church in town.    Because of the troublesome cough Nat prefered to stay at home with  the four small boys, and spent a happy morning in Mrs. Bhaer's room,  listening to the stories she read them, learning the hymns she taught  them, and then quietly employing himself pasting pictures into an old  ledger.    \"This is my Sunday closet,\" she said, showing him shelves filled with  picture-books, paint-boxes, architectural blocks, little diaries, and  materials for letter-writing. \"I want my boys to love Sunday, to find it  a peaceful, pleasant day, when they can rest from common study and  play, yet enjoy quiet pleasures, and learn, in simple ways, lessons more  important than any taught in school. Do you understand me?\" she asked,  watching Nat's attentive face.    \"You mean to be good?\" he said, after hesitating a minute.    \"Yes; to be good, and to love to be good. It is hard work sometimes, I  know very well; but we all help one another, and so we get on. This is  one of the ways in which I try to help my boys,\" and she took down a  thick book, which seemed half-full of writing, and opened at a page on  which there was one word at the top.    \"Why, that's my name!\" cried Nat, looking both surprised and interested.    \"Yes; I have a page for each boy. I keep a little account of how he gets  on through the week, and Sunday night I show him the record. If it is  bad I am sorry and disappointed, if it is good I am glad and proud; but,  whichever it is, the boys know I want to help them, and they try to do  their best for love of me and Father Bhaer.\"    \"I should think they would,\" said Nat, catching a glimpse of Tommy's  name opposite his own, and wondering what was written under it.    Mrs. Bhaer saw his eye on the words, and shook her head, saying, as she  turned a leaf,    \"No, I don't show my records to any but the one to whom each belongs. I  call this my conscience book; and only you and I will ever know what is  to be written on the page below your name. Whether you will be pleased  or ashamed to read it next Sunday depends on yourself. I think it will  be a good report; at any rate, I shall try to make things easy for you  in this new place, and shall be quite contented if you keep our few  rules, live happily with the boys, and learn something.\"    \"I'll try ma'am;\" and Nat's thin face flushed up with the earnestness  of his desire to make Mrs. Bhaer \"glad and proud,\" not \"sorry and  disappointed.\" \"It must be a great deal of trouble to write about so  many,\" he added, as she shut her book with an encouraging pat on the  shoulder.    \"Not to me, for I really don't know which I like best, writing or boys,\"  she said, laughing to see Nat stare with astonishment at the last item.  \"Yes, I know many people think boys are a nuisance, but that is because  they don't understand them. I do; and I never saw the boy yet whom I  could not get on capitally with after I had once found the soft spot in  his heart. Bless me, I couldn't get on at all without my flock of dear,  noisy, naughty, harum-scarum little lads, could I, my Teddy?\" and Mrs.  Bhaer hugged the young rogue, just in time to save the big inkstand from  going into his pocket.    Nat, who had never heard anything like this before, really did not know  whether Mother Bhaer was a trifle crazy, or the most delightful woman he  had ever met. He rather inclined to the latter opinion, in spite of her  peculiar tastes, for she had a way of filling up a fellow's plate before  he asked, of laughing at his jokes, gently tweaking him by the ear, or  clapping him on the shoulder, that Nat found very engaging.    \"Now, I think you would like to go into the school-room and practise  some of the hymns we are to sing to-night,\" she said, rightly guessing  the thing of all others that he wanted to do.    Alone with the beloved violin and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#5)"],[1,"known as the  \"Trade Rat.\"    [Illustration]    Although I have known the Pack-rat for years in the mountains, I never  saw one within the strict lines of the Yellowstone sanctuary. But the  guides all assure me that they are found and manifest the same  disposition here as elsewhere. So that if you should lose sundry bright  things around camp, or some morning find your boots stuffed with  pebbles, deer sign, or thorns, do not turn peevish or charge the guide  with folly; it means, simply, you have been visited by a Mountain Rat,  and any _un_eatables you miss will doubtless be found in his museum,  which will be discovered within a hundred yards--a mass of sticks and  rubbish under a tree--with some bright and shiny things on the top  where the owner can sit amongst them on sunny days, and gloat till his  little black eyes are a-swim, and his small heart filled with holy joy.      THE UPHEAVER--THE MOLE-GOPHER    [Illustration: Pack-rat nest]    As you cross any of the level, well-grassed prairie regions in the  Yellowstone you will see piles of soft earth thrown up in little  hillocks, sometimes a score or more of them bunched together. The  drivers will tell you that these are molehills, which isn't quite true.  For the Mole is a creature unknown in the Park, and the animal that  makes these mounds is exceedingly abundant. It is the common  Mole-gopher, a gopher related very distantly to the Prairie-dog and  Mountain Whistler, but living the underground life of a Mole, though not  even in the same order as that interesting miner, for the Mole-gopher is  a rodent (Order _Rodentia_) and the Mole a bug-eater (Order  _Insectivora_); just as different as Lion and Caribou.    The Mole-gopher is about the size of a rat, but has a short tail and  relatively immense forepaws and claws. It is indeed wonderfully  developed as a digger.    Examine the mound of earth thrown up. If it is a fair example, it will  make fully half a bushel. Next count the mounds that are within a  radius of fifty paces; probably all are the work of this Gopher, or  rather this pair, for they believe in team play.    Search over the ground carefully, and you will discern that there are  scores of ancient mounds flattened by the weather, and traces of  hundreds, perhaps, that date from remote years.    Now multiply the size of one mound by the number of mounds, and you will  have some idea of the work done by this pair. Finally, remembering that  there may be a pair of Gophers for every acre in the Park, estimate the  tons of earth moved by one pair and multiply it by the acres in the  Park, and you will get an idea of the work done by those energetic  rodents as a body, and you will realize how well he has won his Indian  name, the \"Upheaver.\"    We are accustomed to talk of upheaval in geology as a frightful upset of  all nature, but here before our eyes is going on an upheaval of enormous  extent and importance, but so gently and pleasantly done that we enjoy  every phase of the process.

Let me add a segment of the circle to round your  knowledge out.    When nature peopled with our four-foot kin the cold north lands, it was  necessary to clothe these little brethren of ours in a coat that should  be absolutely warm, light, durable, of protective colour, thick in cold  weather, thin in warm. Under these conditions she produced _fur_, with  its densely woolly undercoat and its long, soft, shining outer coat, one  for warmth, the other for wet and wear. Some northern animals can store  up food in holes or in the fat of their bodies, so need not be out when  the intensest cold is on the land. Some have to face the weather all  winter, and in these we find the fur of its best quality. Of this class  are the Marten and the Northern Fox. They are the finest, warmest,  lightest, softest of all furs. But colour is a cardinal point when  beauty is considered and where fashion is Queen. So the choicest colours  are the soft olive brown with silver hairs, found in the Russian Sable,  and the glossy black with silver hairs, found in the true Silver Fox of  the North.      THE MOST WONDERFUL FUR IN THE WORLD    What is the Silver Fox? Simply a black freak, a brunette born into a  red-headed family. But this does not cast any reflection on the mother  or on father's lineage. On the contrary, it means that they had in them  an element of exceptional vigour, which resulted in a peculiar  intensifying of all pigments, transmuting red into black and carrying  with it an unusual vigour of growth and fineness of texture, producing,  in short, the world-famed Silver Fox, the lightest, softest, thickest,  warmest, and most lustrous of furs, the fur worth many times its weight  in gold, and with this single fault, that it does not stand long wear.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: V. Red Fox  _Captive; photo by E. T. Seton_]    [Illustration: VI. Foxes quarrelling  _Captive; photo by E. T. Seton_]    Cold and exposure are wonderful stimulants of the skin, and so it is not  surprising that the real Silver Fox should appear only in very cold  climates. Owing to its elevation the Yellowstone Park has the winter  climate of northern Canada, and, as might have been predicted, the  Silver Fox occurs among the many red-headed or bleached blonde Foxes  that abound in the half open country.    You may travel all round the stage route and neither see nor hear a Fox,  but travel quietly on foot, or better, camp out, and you will soon  discover the crafty one in yellow, or, rather, he will discover you.  How? Usually after you have camped for the night and are sitting quietly  by the fire before the hour of sleep, a curious squall is heard from the  dark hillside or bushes, a squall followed by a bark like that of a toy  terrier. Sometimes it keeps on at intervals for five minutes, and  sometimes it is answered by a similar noise. This is the bark of a Fox.  It differs from the Coyote call in being very short, very squally, much  higher pitched, and without any barks in it that would do credit to a  fair-sized dog. It is no use to go after him. You won't see him. You  should rather sit and enjoy the truly wildwood ring of his music.    In the morning if you look hard in the dust and mud, you may find his  tracks, and once in a while you will see his yellow-brown form drifting  on the prairie as though wind-blown under sail of that enormous tail.  For this is the big-tailed variety of Red Fox.    But if you wish to see the Fox in all his glory you must be here in  winter, when the deep snow cutting off all other foods brings all the  Fox population about the hotels whose winter keepers daily throw out  scraps for which the Foxes, the Magpies, and a dozen other creatures  wait and fight.    From a friend, connected with one of the Park hotels during the early  '90's, I learned that among the big-tailed pensioners of the inn, there  appeared one winter a wonderful Silver Fox; and I heard many rumours  about that Fox. I was told that he disappeared, and did not die of  sickness, old age, or wild-beast violence; and what I heard I may tell  in a different form, only, be it remembered, the names of the persons  and places are disguised, as well as the date; and my informant may have  brought in details that belonged elsewhere. So that you are free to  question much of the account, but the backbone of it is not open to  doubt, and some of the guides in the Park can give you details that I do  not care to put on paper.      THE POACHER AND THE SILVER FOX    How is it that all mankind has a sneaking sympathy with a poacher? A  burglar or a pickpocket has our unmitigated contempt; he clearly is a  criminal; but you will notice that the poacher in the story is generally  a reckless dare-devil with a large and compensatory amount of  good-fellow in his make-up--yes, I almost said, of good citizenship. I  suppose, because in addition to the breezy, romantic character of his  calling, seasoned with physical danger as well as moral risk, there is  away down in human nature a strong feeling that, in spite of man-made  laws, the ancient ruling holds that \"wild game belongs to no man till  some one makes it his property by capture.\" It may be wrong, it may be  right, but I have heard this doctrine voiced by red men and white, as  primitive law, once or twice; and have seen it lived up to a thousand  times.    Well, Josh Cree was a poacher. This does not mean that every night in  every month he went forth with nefarious tricks and tools, to steal the  flesh and fur that legally were not his. Far from it. Josh never poached  but once. But that's enough; he had crossed the line, and this is how it  came about:    As you roll up the Yellowstone from Livingston to Gardiner you may note  a little ranch-house on the west of the track with its log stables, its  corral, its irrigation ditch, and its alfalfa patch of morbid green. It  is a small affair, for it was founded by the handiwork of one honest  man, who with his wife and small boy left Pennsylvania, braved every  danger of the plains, and secured this claim in the late '80's. Old man  Cree--he was only forty, but every married man is \"Old Man\" in the  West--was ready to work at any honest calling from logging or sluicing  to grading and muling. He was strong and steady, his wife was steady and  strong. They saved their money, and little by little they got the small  ranch-house built and equipped;"]]]
