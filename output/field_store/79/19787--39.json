I confess that I never imagined that the effect  could be so sudden and so severe.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and,  reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw  it among a bank of brambles. \"We must give the room a little time to  clear.  I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt  as to how these tragedies were produced?\"    \"None whatever.\"    \"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the arbour here  and let us discuss it together.  That villainous stuff seems still to  linger round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence  points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the  first tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must  remember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family  quarrel, followed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may  have been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I  think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd,  beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge  to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place,  you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which  took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy,  emanated from him.  He had a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he  did not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the  room, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his  departure. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have  risen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not  arrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the  evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"    \"Then his own death was suicide!\"    \"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition.  The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate  upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon  himself.  There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.  Fortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I  have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon  from his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you  would kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing  a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit  for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\"    I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure  of the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in  some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.    \"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I  have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\"    \"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes.  \"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.  You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend  Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the  papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for  the present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will  affect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we  should talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\"    The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my  companion.    \"I am at a loss to know, sir,\" he said, \"what you can have to speak  about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\"    \"The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\" said Holmes.    For a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale's fierce face  turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate  veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with  clenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a  violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps,  more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.    \"I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that  I have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well,  Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"    \"Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the  clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you  and not for the police.\"    Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time  in his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of power in  Holmes's manner which could not be withstood.  Our visitor stammered  for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.    \"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is bluff upon your  part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us  have no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"    \"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that  I hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may be will  depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\"    \"My defence?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"My defence against what?\"    \"Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\"    Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"Upon my word,  you are getting on,\" said he.  \"Do all your successes depend upon this  prodigious power of bluff?\"    \"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon  Sterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the  facts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return from  Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say  nothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors  which had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama--\"    \"I came back--\"    \"I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and  inadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I  suspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage,  waited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"    \"How do you know that?\"    \"I followed you.\"    \"I saw no one.\"    \"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a  restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in  the early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your  door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish  gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\"    Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.    \"You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the  vicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed  tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet.  At the  vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out  under the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the  household was not yet stirring.  You drew some of the gravel from your  pocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\"    Sterndale sprang to his feet.    \"I believe that you are the devil himself!\" he cried.    Holmes smiled at the compliment.  \"It took two, or possibly three,  handfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You beckoned him to  come down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room.  You entered by the window.  There was an interview--a short one--during  which you walked up and down the room.  Then you passed out and closed  the window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching  what occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as  you had come.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and  what were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or trifle  with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my  hands forever.\"    Our visitor's face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of  his accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in  his hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a  photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table  before us.    \"That is why I have done it,\" said he.    It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes stooped  over it.    \"Brenda Tregennis,\" said he.    \"Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\" repeated our visitor.  \"For years I have loved  her.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of that Cornish  seclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has brought me close to  the one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for  I have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable  laws of England, I could not divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For  years I waited.  And this is what we have waited for.\"  A terrible sob  shook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled  beard.  Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:    \"The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you that she  was an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to me and I  returned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such  a fate had come upon my darling?  There you have the missing clue to my  action, Mr. Holmes.\"    \"Proceed,\" said my friend.    Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the  table.  On the outside was written \"Radix pedis diaboli\" with a red  poison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],[0,"Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#5)"],[1,"thanks to God, the rest following his example.  He then,  drawing his sword, took possession of the island, which he named San  Salvador, in the names of the sovereigns of Castile.  The crews now  thronged round the Admiral, some embracing him, others kissing his  hands, expressing their joy; the most mutinous becoming the most  enthusiastic and devoted.    The natives, who had at first fled, supposing the ships monsters which  had risen from the deep, recovering their fears, now timidly advanced,  lost in admiration at the shining armour and splendid dresses of the  Spaniards, and their complexions and beards, at once recognising the  Admiral as the commander of the strangers.    Columbus, pleased with their gentleness, suffered them to scrutinise  him, and won them by his benignity.  The natives were equally objects of  curiosity to the Spaniards.  They were naked, painted all over with a  variety of colours and designs.  Their complexion was tawny, and they  were destitute of beards; their hair not crisp, like that of negroes,  but straight and coarse; their features were agreeable; their stature  moderate and well shaped; their foreheads lofty, and their eyes  remarkably fine.    As Columbus supposed that he had landed on an island at the extremity of  India, he called the natives Indians, as the inhabitants of the New  World have ever since been denominated.  Their only arms were lances  pointed with the teeth or bones of fishes.  There was no iron seen, and  so ignorant were the natives of its properties, that one of them took a  drawn sword by the edge, not aware that it would cut.    Columbus, to win their confidence, distributed among them coloured caps,  hawks' bells, and glass beads, with which they were highly pleased,  allowing the Spaniards unmolested to walk about the groves examining the  beautiful trees, the shrubs, fruits, and flowers, all so strange to  them.    The next morning canoes of all sizes, formed out of single trees, came  off, some holding one man, some forty or fifty, who managed them with  great dexterity.    They readily accepted toys and trinkets, which, supposing them to be  brought from heaven, possessed a supernatural virtue in their eyes.  The  only things they had to give in return were parrots and balls of  cotton-yarn, besides cassava cakes, formed from the flour of a root  called yuca, which they cultivated in their fields.  The Spaniards, who  were eagerly looking out for gold, were delighted to obtain some small  ornaments of that metal in exchange for beads and hawks' bells.  As it  was a royal monopoly, Columbus forbade any traffic in it, as he did also  in cotton, reserving to the crown all trade in it.    Misled by the accounts he had read in Marco Polo's works, he was from  the first persuaded that he had arrived at the islands lying opposite  Cathay in the Chinese seas, and that the country to the south, which he  understood from the natives abounded in gold, must be the famous island  of Cipango.    San Salvador, where he first landed, still retains its name, though  called by the English from its shape Cat Island.  It is one of the great  cluster of the Lucayos or Bahama Islands.  Coasting round it in the  boats, the Admiral visited various spots, and had friendly intercourse  with the natives, to whom he gave glass beads and other trifles.    He landed at another place, where there were six Indian huts surrounded  by groves and gardens as beautiful as those of Castile.    At last the sailors, wearied with their exertions, returned to the  ships, carrying seven Indians, that they might, by acquiring the Spanish  language, serve as interpreters.  Taking in a supply of wood and water,  the squadron sailed the same evening to the south, where the Admiral  expected to discover Cipango.  As the Indians told him there were  upwards of a hundred islands in the neighbourhood, he was confirmed in  his belief that they must be those described by Marco Polo, abounding  with gold, silver, drugs, and spices.    Several other islands were visited, but the explorers looked in vain for  bracelets and anklets of gold.  One day, just as the ships were about to  make sail, one of the San Salvador Indians on board the _Nina_, plunging  overboard, swam to a large canoe which had come near.  A boat was sent  in chase, but the Indians in their light canoe escaped, and reaching the  island fled to the woods.  Shortly afterwards a canoe, having on board a  single native, coming near, he was captured and brought to Columbus,  who, treating him with kindness won his heart; his canoe was also  restored to him, and that taken by the _Nina_ was set at liberty.    Soon afterwards, while traversing the channel between two islands, when  about midway another Indian in his canoe was overtaken, a string of  glass beads round his neck, showing that he had come from San Salvador.    Columbus, admiring his hardihood, had him and his canoe taken on board,  when he was treated with great kindness, bread and honey being given him  to eat.  It was too late to select a spot through the transparent sea  for anchoring, and the ship lay to until the morning, while the Indian  voyager, with all his effects and loaded with presents, was allowed to  depart.    Next day the natives came off, bringing fruits, and roots, and pure  water.  They were treated in the same way as the former had been.  Their  huts, which were formed of tall poles and branches neatly interwoven  with palm-leaves of a circular form, were visited.  They were clean and  neat, and generally sheltered under wide-spreading trees.  For beds they  had nets of cotton extended between two posts, which they called  hammocks, a name since generally adopted by seamen.    Columbus, as he sailed round the island, found a magnificent harbour,  sufficient to hold a hundred ships.  He was delighted with the beauty of  the scenery, the shady groves, the fruits, the herbs and flowers,--all  differing so greatly from those of Spain.  Everywhere the natives  received their visitors as superior beings, and gladly conducted them to  the coolest springs, and assisted them in rolling their casks to the  boats.  To the last island visited by Columbus he gave the name of  Fernandina.  Sailing thence on the 19th of October, he steered in quest  of a large island called Saometo, where, misled by his guides, he  expected to find the sovereign of the surrounding islands, habited in  rich clothes and jewels and gold, possessed of great treasures, a large  city, and a gold-mine.  Neither were found; but the voyagers were  delighted with the balmy air, the beautiful scenery, the graceful trees,  the vast flocks of parrots and other birds of gorgeous plumage, and the  fish, which rivalled them in the brilliancy of their colours.  No  animals were seen, with the exception of a dog which never barked, a  species of rabbit, and numerous lizards and iguanas.    Columbus was as much misled by his own fervent imagination as by not  comprehending the accounts given him by the natives.  He proposed that  his stay at those islands should depend upon the quantity of gold,  spices, precious stones, and other objects of Oriental trade which he  should find there.  After this he intended to proceed to the mainland of  India, which he calculated was within ten days' sail, and there, after  visiting some of its magnificent capitals described by Marco Polo, he  would deliver the letters of the sovereigns to the Grand Khan, with  whose reply he would return triumphantly to Spain.    Such was his idea when, leaving the Bahamas, he went in quest of the  island of Cuba, of which he had been told.    Touching at various islands, having crossed the Bahama bank, he came in  sight of Cuba on the morning of the 28th of October.  He was struck as  he approached by its lofty mountains, its far-stretching headlands, its  plains and valleys, and noble rivers.    He anchored in a beautiful stream, the banks overhung with trees.  Here  landing, he took possession of the island, giving it the name of Juana,  in honour of Prince Juan, and the river that of San Salvador.  Going on  shore in search of the inhabitants, he found only two abandoned huts,  containing a few nets, hooks, and harpoons of bone, showing that the  owners were mere savages.    Again he was delighted with the scenery, and the vast flights of birds  of gorgeous plumage, parrots, woodpeckers, and humming-birds flitting  among the trees, and sucking honey from the flowers.  He fancied too,  from the smell of the woods, that he perceived the fragrance of Oriental  spices.  He discovered also shells of the kind of oysters which produce  pearls.    Having experienced since his arrival soft and genial weather, he  concluded that a perpetual serenity reigned over those happy seas.  Though the inhabitants had fled, he remarked that their dwellings were  better built than those he had hitherto seen, being clean in the  extreme; and as he discovered a few rude statues and wooden masks  ingeniously carved, he supposed that these signs of civilisation would  go on increasing as he advanced towards _terra firma_.  He fancied that  the inhabitants had fled, mistaking his armament for one of those  scouring expeditions sent by the Grand Khan to make prisoners and  slaves.  He, however, with the assistance of his Indian friends,  succeeded in calming the fears of the natives, who came off in sixteen  canoes, bringing cotton-yarn and other simple articles of traffic.  He  forbade, however, all trading for anything but gold, that the natives  might be tempted to produce the real riches of their country.    Again misled by his guides, he was induced to believe that a powerful  chief lived in the interior of the country, and two of his officers were  therefore dispatched, carrying presents and specimens of spices and  drugs, to ascertain whether such productions were to be found there.  They were directed also to obtain all the information they"]]]
