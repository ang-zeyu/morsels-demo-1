Thus when she was called to Castel Nuovo  her joy was great, for she felt that her dreams now began to be  realised. Philippa was installed at the court, and a few months after  she began to nurse the child the fisherman was dead and she was a widow.  Meanwhile Raymond of Cabane, the major-domo of King Charles II's house,  had bought a negro from some corsairs, and having had him baptized by  his own name, had given him his liberty; afterwards observing that he  was able and intelligent, he had appointed him head cook in the king's  kitchen; and then he had gone away to the war. During the absence of his  patron the negro managed his own affairs at the court so cleverly, that  in a short time he was able to buy land, houses, farms, silver plate,  and horses, and could vie in riches with the best in the kingdom; and as  he constantly won higher favour in the royal family, he passed on from  the kitchen to the wardrobe. The Catanese had also deserved very well of  her employers, and as a reward for the care she had bestowed on the  child, the princess married her to the negro, and he, as a wedding gift,  was granted the title of knight.    From this day forward, Raymond of Cabane and Philippa the laundress rose  in the world so rapidly that they had no equal in influence at court.  After the death of Dona Violante, the Catanese became the intimate  friend of Dona Sandra, Robert's second wife, whom we introduced to our  readers at the beginning of this narrative. Charles, her foster son,  loved her as a mother, and she was the confidante of his two wives in  turn, especially of the second wife, Marie of Valois. And as the quondam  laundress had in the end learned all the manners and customs of the  court, she was chosen at the birth of Joan and her sister to be  governess and mistress over the young girls, and at this juncture  Raymond was created major-domo. Finally, Marie of Valois on her deathbed  commended the two young princesses to her care, begging her to look on  them as her own-daughters. Thus Philippa the Catanese, honoured in  future as foster mother of the heiress to the throne of Naples, had  power to nominate her husband grand seneschal, one of the seven most  important offices in the kingdom, and to obtain knighthood for her sons.  Raymond of Cabane was buried like a king in a marble tomb in the church  of the Holy Sacrament, and there was speedily joined by two of his sons.  The third, Robert, a youth of extraordinary strength and beauty, gave up  an ecclesiastical career, and was himself made major-domo, his two  sisters being married to the Count of Merlizzi and the Count of Morcone  respectively. This was now the state of affairs, and the influence of  the grand seneschal's widow seemed for ever established, when an  unexpected event suddenly occurred, causing such injury as might well  suffice to upset the edifice of her fortunes that had been raised stone  by stone patiently and slowly: this edifice was now undermined and  threatened to fall in a single day. It was the sudden apparition of  Friar Robert, who followed to the court of Rome his young pupil, who  from infancy had been Joan's destined husband, which thus shattered all  the designs of the Catanese and seriously menaced her future. The monk  had not been slow to understand that so long as she remained at the  court, Andre would be no more than the slave, possibly even the victim,  of his wife. Thus all Friar Robert's thoughts were obstinately  concentrated on a single end, that of getting rid of the Catanese or  neutralising her influence. The prince's tutor and the governess of the  heiress had but to exchange one glance, icy, penetrating, plain to read:  their looks met like lightning flashes of hatred and of vengeance. The  Catanese, who felt she was detected, lacked courage to fight this man in  the open, and so conceived the hope of strengthening her tottering  empire by the arts of corruption and debauchery. She instilled by  degrees into her pupil's mind the poison of vice, inflamed her youthful  imagination with precocious desires, sowed in her heart the seeds of an  unconquerable aversion for her husband, surrounded the poor child with  abandoned women, and especially attached to her the beautiful and  attractive Dona Cancha, who is branded by contemporary authors with the  name of a courtesan; then summed up all these lessons in infamy by  prostituting Joan to her own son. The poor girl, polluted by sin before  she knew what life was, threw her whole self into this first passion  with all the ardour of youth, and loved Robert of Cabane so violently,  so madly, that the Catanese congratulated herself on the success of her  infamy, believing that she held her prey so fast in her toils that her  victim would never attempt to escape them.    A year passed by before Joan, conquered by her infatuation, conceived  the smallest suspicion of her lover's sincerity. He, more ambitious than  affectionate, found it easy to conceal his coldness under the cloak of a  brotherly intimacy, of blind submission, and of unswerving devotion;  perhaps he would have deceived his mistress for a longer time had not  Bertrand of Artois fallen madly in love with Joan. Suddenly the bandage  fell from the young girl's eyes; comparing the two with the natural  instinct of a woman beloved which never goes astray, she perceived that  Robert of Cabane loved her for his own sake, while Bertrand of Artois  would give his life to make her happy. A light fell upon her past: she  mentally recalled the circumstances that preceded and accompanied her  earliest love; and a shudder went through her at the thought that she  had been sacrificed to a cowardly seducer by the very woman she had  loved most in the world, whom she had called by the name of mother.    Joan drew back into herself, and wept bitterly. Wounded by a single blow  in all her affections, at first her grief absorbed her; then, roused to  sudden anger, she proudly raised her head, for now her love was changed  to scorn. Robert, amazed at her cold and haughty reception of him,  following on so great a love, was stung by jealousy and wounded pride.  He broke out into bitter reproach and violent recrimination, and,  letting fall the mask, once for all lost his place in Joan's heart.    His mother at last saw that it was time to interfere: she rebuked her  son, accusing him of upsetting all her plans by his clumsiness.    \"As you have failed to conquer her by love,\" she said, \"you must now  subdue her by fear. The secret of her honour is in our hands, and she  will never dare to rebel. She plainly loves Bertrand of Artois, whose  languishing eyes and humble sighs contrast in a striking manner with  your haughty indifference and your masterful ways. The mother of the  Princes of Tarentum, the Empress of Constantinople, will easily seize an  occasion of helping on the princess's love so as to alienate her more  and more from her husband: Cancha will be the go between, and sooner or  later we shall find Bertrand at Joan's feet. Then she will be able to  refuse us nothing.\"    While all this was going on, the old king died, and the Catanese, who  had unceasingly kept on the watch for the moment she had so plainly  foreseen, loudly called to her son, when she saw Bertrand slip into  Joan's apartment, saying as she drew him after her--    \"Follow me, the queen is ours.\"    It was thus that she and her son came to be there. Joan, standing in the  middle of the chamber, pallid, her eyes fixed on the curtains of the  bed, concealed her agitation with a smile, and took one step forward  towards her governess, stooping to receive the kiss which the latter  bestowed upon her every morning. The Catanese embraced her with affected  cordiality, and turning, to her son, who had knelt upon one knee, said,  pointing to Robert--    \"My fair queen, allow the humblest of your subjects to offer his sincere  congratulations and to lay his homage at your feet.\"    \"Rise, Robert,\" said Joan, extending her hand kindly, and with no show  of bitterness. \"We were brought up together, and I shall never forget  that in our childhood--I mean those happy days when we were both  innocent--I called you my brother.\"    \"As you allow me, madam,\" said Robert, with an ironical smile, \"I too  shall always remember the names you formerly gave me.\"    \"And I,\" said the Catanese, \"shall forget that I speak to the Queen of  Naples, in embracing once more my beloved daughter. Come, madam, away  with care: you have wept long enough; we have long respected your grief.  It is now time to show yourself to these good Neapolitans who bless  Heaven continually for granting them a queen so beautiful and good; it  is time that your favours fall upon the heads of your faithful subjects,  and my son, who surpasses all in his fidelity, comes first to ask a  favour of you, in order that he may serve you yet more zealously.\"    Joan cast on Robert a withering look, and, speaking to the Catanese,  said with a scornful air--    \"You know, madam, I can refuse your son nothing.\"    \"All he asks,\" continued the lady, \"is a title which is his due, and  which he inherited from his father--the title of Grand Seneschal of the  Two Sicilies: I trust, my daughter, you will have no difficulty in  granting this.\"    \"But I must consult the council of regency.\"    \"The council will hasten to ratify the queen's wishes,\" replied Robert,  handing her the parchment with an imperious gesture: \"you need only  speak to the Count of Artois.\"    And he cast a threatening glance at the curtain, which had slightly  moved.    \"You are right,\" said the queen at once; and going up to a table she  signed the parchment with a trembling hand.    \"Now, my daughter, I have come in the name of all the care I bestowed on  your infancy, of all the maternal love I have lavished on you, to  implore a favour that my family will remember for evermore.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#5)"],[1,"are long-range transport of  pollutants, sustainable development, and climate change.    Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.    Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.    Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it  can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.    Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.    Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with  respect to endangered or threatened species.    Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.    Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.    Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes  salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process;  also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.    Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.    Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which  trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary  agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which  point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is  sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for  regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do  not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the  environment .    Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of  poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or  fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of  topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.    Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,  and desertification.    Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy  emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by  the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and  has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.    Water-born diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are  transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.    Environment - international agreements    This entry separates country participation in international  environmental agreements into two levels - party to and signed, but not  ratified. Agreements are listed in alphabetical order by the  abbreviated form of the full name.    Environmental agreements    This information is presented in Appendix C: Selected International  Environmental Agreements, which includes the name, abbreviation, date  opened for signature, date entered into force, objective, and parties  by category.    Ethnic groups    This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups starting with  the largest and normally includes the percent of total population.    Exchange rates    This entry provides the official value of a country's monetary unit at  a given date or over a given period of time, as expressed in units of  local currency per US dollar and as determined by international market  forces or official fiat.    Executive branch    This entry includes several subfields. Chief of state includes the name  and title of the titular leader of the country who represents the state  at official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the  day-to-day activities of the government. Head of government includes  the name and title of the top administrative leader who is designated  to manage the day-to-day activities of the government. For example, in  the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is  the head of government. In the US, the president is both the chief of  state and the head of government. Cabinet includes the official name  for this body of high-ranking advisers and the method for selection of  members. Elections includes the nature of election process or accession  to power, date of the last election, and date of the next election.  Election results includes the percent of vote for each candidate in the  last election.    Exports    This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise exports  on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are calculated on an  exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.    Exports - commodities    This entry provides a rank ordering of exported products starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Exports - partners    This entry provides a rank ordering of trading partners starting with  the most important; it sometimes includes the percent of total dollar  value.    Fiscal year    This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for a country's  accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar year but  which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for the  calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).    Flag description    This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual  flags or the best information available at the time the entry was  written. The flags of independent states are used by their dependencies  unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and  other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic    Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at the beginning of  the country profile. The flag graphics were produced from actual flags  or the best information available at the time of preparation. The flags  of independent states are used by their dependencies unless there is an  officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not  have flags.    GDP (official exchange rate)    This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final  goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's  GDP at offical exchange rates (OER) is the home-currency-denominated  annual GDP figure divided by the bilateral average US exchange rate  with that country in that year. The measure is simple to compute and  gives a precise measure of the value of output. Many economists prefer  this measure when gauging the economic power an economy maintains vis-  à-vis its neighbors, judging that an exchange rate captures the  purchasing power a nation enjoys in the international marketplace.  Official exchange rates, however, can be artifically fixed and/or  subject to manipulation - resulting in claims of the country having an  under- or over-valued currency - and are not necessarily the equivalent  of a market-determined exchange rate. Moreover, even if the official  exchange rate is market-determined, market exchange rates are  frequently established by a relatively small set of goods and services  (the ones the country trades) and may not capture the value of the  larger set of goods the country produces. Furthermore, OER-converted  GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic GDP over time, since  appreciation/depreciation from one year to the next will make the OER  GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-currency-denominated GDP  changed.    GDP (purchasing power parity)    This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final  goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's  GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of  all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices  prevailing in the United States. This is the measure most economists  prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living  conditions or use of resources across countries. The measure is  difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all  goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and  services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example,  the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP  estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes  different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not  formally participate in the World Bank's PPP project that calculates  these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may  lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures  are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The  difference between the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of  the weathly industrialized countries are generally much smaller.    GDP - composition by sector    This entry gives the percentage contribution of agriculture, industry,  and services to total GDP. The distribution will total less than 100  percent if the data are incomplete.    GDP - per capita (PPP)    This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by  population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate    This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis adjusted for inflation  and expressed as a percent.    GDP methodology    In the Economy category, GDP dollar estimates for countries are  reported both on an official exchange rate (OER) and a purchasing power  parity (PPP) basis.
