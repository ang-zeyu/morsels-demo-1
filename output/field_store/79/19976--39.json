The German General Staff did not believe the Belgians intended to raise  a serious barrier in their path. But with the crisis, democratic Belgium  united in a rush to arms, which recalls similar action by the American  colonists at the Revolution. Every form of weapon was grasped, from old  muskets to pitchforks and shearing knives. It was remarked by a foreign  witness that in default of properly equipped armories, the Belgians  emptied the museums to confront the Germans with the strangest  assortment of antiquated military tools.    As testimony of Belgian feeling, the Labor party organ \"Le Peuple\"  issued the following statement: \"Why do we, as irreconcilable  antimilitarists, cry 'Bravo!' from the bottom of our hearts to all those  who offer themselves for the defense of the country? Because it is not  only necessary to protect the hearths and homes, the women and the  children, but it is also necessary to protect at the price of our blood  the heritage of our ancient freedom. Go, then, sons of the workers, and  register your names as recruits. We will rather die for the idea of  progress and solidarity of humanity than live under a regime whose  brutal force and savage violence have wiped outright.\"    The Belgian General Staff, foreseeing dire consequences from the  invading hosts, warned all to maintain as peaceful an attitude as  possible. In spite of the efforts of Belgian officials, severe penalties  were inflicted on the citizens.    On Wednesday, August 12, 1914, a German cavalry screen, thrown in  advance of the main forces, came in touch with Belgian patrols. A series  of engagements took place. The Germans tried to seize the bridges across  the Dyle at Haelen, and at Cortenachen on the Velpe, a tributary of the  former river, mainly with the object of outflanking the Belgian left  wing. The Belgians are said to have numbered some 10,000 of all arms,  and were successful in repulsing the Germans.    On August 13, 1914, similar actions were continued. At Tirlemont 2,000  German cavalry swept upon the town, but were beaten off. At Eghezee on  the extreme Belgian right--close to Namur and the historic field of  Ramillies--another brush with the Germans took place. Belgian cavalry  caught a German cavalry detachment bivouacked in the village. Sharp  fighting through the streets ensued before the Germans withdrew. In  spite of the warning of the Belgian General Staff, and similar advance  German notices, the citizens of some of these and other places began  sniping German patrols.    Meantime, moving over the roads toward Namur, toiled the huge German  42-centimeter guns. The German General Staff had taken to mind the  lesson of Liege. Each gun was transported in several parts, hauled by  traction engines and forty horses. Of this, with the advance of Von  Kluck and Von Buelow, the Belgian General Staff was kept in total  ignorance by the German screen of cavalry. So ably was this screen work  performed that the Belgians were led to believe the Germans had  succeeded in placing no more than two divisions of cavalry, together  with a few detachments of infantry and artillery, on Belgian soil. They,  in fact, regarded the German cavalry skirmishing as a rather clumsy  offensive.    As we have seen, the resistance of Forts Boncelles and Loncin at Liege  held back the main German advance from seven to ten days. Their fall  released into German control the railway junction at Ans. With that was  included the line from Liege up the left bank of the Meuse to Namur.  Also, another line direct to Brussels.    On August 15, 1914, the cavalry screen was withdrawn, and four German  army corps were revealed to the surprised Belgian line. In this  emergency, clearly their only hope lay with the French. In Louvain,  Brussels, and Antwerp, anxious questions lay on all lips. \"Why do not  the French hasten to our aid? When will they come? Will the British fail  us at the twelfth hour?\"    Eager watchers at Ostend beheld no sign of the promised transports to  disembark a British army of support in the day of overwhelming need.  About this time some French cavalry crossed the Sambre to join hands  with the Belgian right wing near Waterloo. But it was little more than a  detachment. The French General Staff was occupied with a realignment,  and had decided not to advance into Belgium until they could do so in  force sufficient to cope with the Germans. The Belgian General Staff saw  there was no other course but to fall back, fighting rear-guard actions  until the longed-for French army was heralded by the thunder of friendly  guns.    The Belgian army was thus withdrawn from the River Gethe to hold  Aerschot on its left stubbornly through August 14, 1914. Diest, St.  Trond, and Waremme fell before the German tidal wave without resistance.  Von Kluck's main army endeavored to sweep around the Belgian right at  Wavre, but was checked for a brief space.          CHAPTER IV    CAPTURE OF LOUVAIN--SURRENDER OF BRUSSELS      During August 17, 1914, the German center was hurled forward in  irresistible strength. The citizens of the villages in its path fled  precipitously along the roads to Brussels. At intersections all kinds of  vehicles bearing household effects, together with live stock, blocked  the way to safety. The uhlan had become a terror, but not without some  provocation. Tirlemont was bombarded, reduced, and evacuated by the  Belgian troops. The latter made a vigorous defensive immediately before  Louvain, but their weakness in artillery and numbers could not withstand  the overwhelming superiority of the Germans. They were thrust back from  the valley of the Dyle to begin their retreat on Antwerp, chiefly by way  of Malines. This was to elude a successful German envelopment on their  Louvain right. They retired in good order, but their losses had been  considerable.    This body was the Belgian right wing, which fell back to take up a  position before Louvain. Here it fought a well-sustained action on  August 19, 1914, the purpose of which was to cover the retreat of the  main army by way of Malines on Antwerp. The Belgian right wing thus  became a rear guard.    It withstood the German attack until the early morning of August 20,  1914, when, separated from the main body, the overpowering number of  German guns and men drove it back to a final stand between Louvain and  Brussels. If its losses had been heavy, the carrying away of the wounded  proved that it still maintained a fighting front. The retreat of the  main army on Antwerp was part of Brialmont's plan for the defense of  Belgium, since the position of Brussels was not capable of a strong  defense. By this time the main army was safely passing down the valley  of the Dyle to the shelter of the Antwerp forts, leaving the right wing  to its fate. Louvain thus fell to the Germans.    Toward noon of August 20, 1914, the burgomaster and four sheriffs  awaited at one of the city gates, the first German appearance. This  proved to be a party of hussars bearing a white flag. They conducted the  burgomaster to the waiting generals at the head of the advance column.  In token of surrender the burgomaster was requested to remove his scarf  of office, displaying the Belgian national colors. The German terms were  then pronounced. A free passage of troops through the city was to be  granted, and 3,000 men garrisoned in its barracks. In return, cash was  to be paid for all supplies requisitioned, and a guarantee given for the  lives and property of the inhabitants. The Germans further agreed to  maintain the established civil power, but warned that hostile acts by  civilians would be severely punished. These terms were in general in  conformity with the rules of war governing the military occupation of an  enemy city. The Germans put forward the claim that the hostile act of  any civilian places him in the same position as a spy, to be punished by  death.    The Germans entered Louvain with bands playing, and singing in a great  swelling chorus: \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" and \"Hail to the War Lord.\" They  marched to quick time, but in passing through the great square of the  Gare du Nord broke into the parade goose step. In the van were such  famous regiments as the Death's Head and Zeiten Hussars. The infantry  wore heavy boots, which, falling in unison, struck the earth with  resounding blows, to echo back from the house walls. Thus cavalry,  infantry, and artillery poured through Louvain in a gray-green surge of  hitherto unimagined military might. This, for the latter part of the  20th and the day following.    At first the citizens looked on from the sidewalks in a spellbound  silence. Scarcely one seemed to possess the incentive to breathe a  whisper. Only the babies and very small children regarded the  awe-inspiring spectacle as something provided by way of entertainment.  For the rest of the citizens it was dumbfounding beyond human  comprehension. Cavalry, infantry, and artillery rolled on unceasingly to  the clatter of horses' hoofs, the tramp of feet, the rumble of guns, and  that triumphant mighty chorus. There was nothing of aforetime plumed and  gold-laced splendor of war about it, but the modern Teutonic arms on  grim business bent. Except for a curious glance bestowed here and there,  the German troops marched with eyes front, and a precision as if being  reviewed by the emperor. A few shots were heard to stir instant terror  among the citizen onlookers, but these were between the German advance  guard and Belgian stragglers left behind in the city. Presently the side  streets became dangerous to pedestrians from onrushing automobiles  containing staff officers, and motor wagons of the military train.  General von Arnim, in command, ordered the hauling down of all allied  colors, but permitted the Belgian flag to remain flying above the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29329"],[0,"Sandwiches (#5)"],[1,"  at once.      Lettuce Sandwiches    Have bread made into a large, square loaf, take off the crust from one  end, butter and then cut into slices. Take the white part of lettuce,  wash and wipe it perfectly dry; have ready three hard-boiled eggs,  remove the yolks, put them through a sieve and rub to a perfectly smooth  paste with four tablespoonfuls of very thick cream. Add one-half  tablespoonful lemon juice and then stir in about four tablespoonfuls of  whipped cream; season with red pepper and add teaspoonful of salt. Cover  slices of bread with leaves of lettuce, put on a goodly quantity of  dressing and then on top of this another slice of bread. This may be  served in squares tied together with ribbon, or they may be pressed and  cut into long narrow pieces. Of course, they must be made only a short  time before serving.      Lobster Sandwiches    Whole wheat bread or the ordinary Boston brown bread is the most  desirable for these sandwiches. Plunge the lobster into hot water; bring  to boiling point, and simmer gently three-quarters of an hour; remove  the meat, and cut it with a silver knife into dice. Now, sprinkle the  lobster with a little salt, red pepper and a tablespoonful of tarragon  vinegar. Allow it to stand for a few minutes, and then sprinkle over two  or three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. As soon as the butter has  chilled on the lobster, put a goodly layer over a slice of buttered  bread; cover with another slice of bread; press the two together, and  remove the crusts. Remember, there is only one layer of lobster between  two slices of bread.      Lobster Salad Sandwiches    Cut fine the solid portion from one boiled lobster, put it into a bowl,  dust it lightly with salt and pepper and sprinkle over two  tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Make a half cupful of mayonnaise from the  yolk of one egg and eight tablespoonfuls of olive oil. Select crisp  lettuce leaves. Mix the mayonnaise with the lobster, put a thin layer  over a slice of buttered bread, cover with a lettuce leaf, put another  thin layer of lobster on top of the lettuce leaf, then a second slice of  buttered bread. Press firmly together, cut off the crusts and cut the  slices into halves long ways, or you may make it into three fingers.      Mutton Sandwiches    Chop a half pound of cold, cooked mutton very fine; add two  tablespoonfuls of cream or olive oil, a tablespoonful of capers, half a  teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper; mix thoroughly.  Butter the slices on the loaf; cut them one-half inch thick, and trim  off the crusts. Spread thickly with the mixture; put at each of the four  corners a mint leaf; put on top another slice of buttered bread, from  which you have trimmed the crust, press the two together, and cut from  corner to corner making four triangles.    These sandwiches may also be flavored with tomato catsup.      Mutton Club Sandwiches    Cut brown bread into rounds or circles with an ordinary cake cutter.  Chop one-half pound of cold, boiled mutton rather fine; add two  tablespoonfuls of olive oil, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a  saltspoonful of paprika. Peel four or five quite solid tomatoes, cut  them into slices and push out the seeds. Put a slice of tomato on top of  a round of bread, fill the space from which you have taken the seeds  with the mutton mixture; put on top another round of buttered bread, and  press the two together. You may, if you like, put on top of the tomato a  lettuce leaf, and in the center of that half a teaspoonful of mayonnaise  dressing. Nice for luncheon on a warm day.      English Mutton Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold boiled mutton to make a pint. Add to it two  tablespoonfuls of capers, a half teaspoonful of salt, six tablespoonfuls  of cream or olive oil and a saltspoonful of pepper. Mash carefully and  put between layers of buttered bread; trim the crusts and cut into  triangles.      Spring Lamb Sandwiches    Grind sufficient lamb to make a half pint, putting through the meat  grinder with the lamb the leaves from six stalks of mint. Add a half  teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or cream, and a  saltspoonful of pepper. Rub this to a paste and spread between toasted  English muffins. Leaves of mint may be put over the top of the lamb  before putting the muffins together.      Turkish Sandwiches    Chop sufficient cold roasted mutton to make a pint; add two solid  tomatoes from a can of tomatoes, or two fresh tomatoes, peeled, the  seeds pressed out and the flesh chopped fine. Add a half cupful of  piñons or pine nuts, and sufficient olive oil to bind the whole  together. Spread this between thin, warm milk or beaten biscuits and  serve for afternoon tea or supper.      Picnic Sandwiches    Take the ordinary French rolls; make a round opening in the top of  each, and then, with your finger, scoop out all the crumb, leaving the  roll in shape with a very small opening on top. Save the little piece of  crust from the top of the opening. Mix together four olives, one  gherkin, a tablespoonful of capers and one large green, sweet pepper,  chopped very fine. Chop fine two ounces of tongue, and mix it with the  white meat of one chicken, chopped fine. Mix together, and moisten with  a well-made mayonnaise dressing. Fill this into the roll, put on the  top, and arrange neatly on a napkin in a wicker basket; serve at once.  The rolls may be prepared and the mixture made some time before serving,  but the two should be put together at the last moment.      Potato Sandwiches    Mash four good-sized boiled potatoes; add a level teaspoonful of salt,  four tablespoonfuls of thick cream, and the yolks of four hard-boiled  eggs rubbed to a smooth paste, a saltspoonful of pepper, two  tablespoonfuls of olive oil; mix thoroughly until you have a perfectly  smooth paste. Put this between slices of brown bread and butter, trim  off the crusts, and cut into triangles. The top may be garnished with  cress or lettuce.      Salad Sandwiches    Chop fine half a pound of cold, cooked chicken; mix with it six  tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise dressing; add half a teaspoonful of salt  and a saltspoonful of pepper; put this between slices of bread and  butter, and cut into fancy shapes.    These sandwiches may also be trimmed with lettuce or cress, and almost  any meat may be substituted for the chicken. If beef is used, a  tablespoonful of tomato catsup may be added; with mutton a tablespoonful  of capers. Beef is much better garnished with cress, mutton with mint,  chicken with lettuce or celery.    Lobsters and crabs may be mixed with mayonnaise and used as a salad  sandwich; garnish of course with lettuce.      Fish Salad Sandwiches    Flake one can of salmon, or an equal quantity of cold boiled fish. Add  to it a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne and one ordinary  cucumber, grated and drained. Just before serving time butter the bread,  cut it into thin slices, put over the top a layer of the flaked fish,  then a thin layer of mayonnaise or sandwich dressing and another  covering of bread. Press together, trim the crusts and cut directly  across the slice, making two long sandwiches about an inch and a half to  two inches wide.      Sardine Salad Sandwiches    These, like salmon sandwiches, are made from materials usually in every  household, and can be made at a moment's notice. Stir four  tablespoonfuls of oil into an egg, add a few drops of vinegar or lemon  juice. Remove the sardines from the oil, take off the tails and heads  and remove the bones. Mash them in a bowl, add a tablespoonful of  vinegar, or the same amount of lemon juice. If you have lettuce or  cress, either shred it, or put one leaf between the fish and the  buttered bread.      Sardine Sandwiches    Cut slices of bread about one-half an inch thick, butter and toast; trim  off the crust. Remove skin and bones from the sardines, lay them  carefully over toast; have ready, chopped very fine, some olives and  capers, mixed together; sprinkle these over the sardines, then a  teaspoonful of lemon juice to each sandwich. Cut into any shape you may  desire and they are ready to serve.      Swiss Sandwiches    Put half a pound of ordinary schmierkase into a bowl, rub it perfectly  smooth; add, a teaspoonful at a time, four tablespoonfuls of thick  cream, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoonful of salt,  and a saltspoonful of pepper. Butter the slices of bread on the loaf;  cut each off about a half inch in thickness, trim off the crusts and  spread with the cheese mixture; put on top a layer of pumpernickel or  rye bread; on top of that another thin layer of cheese, and on top of  that another layer of white bread and butter; press these lightly  together. If the crusts have been trimmed off, cut the slices into three  or four finger shaped sandwiches. They should be the length of the slice  and about one inch wide. These are exceedingly nice garnished with  cress.    In arranging them for serving, put a layer of sandwiches and a layer of  cress all through the basket or dish.      Tongue Sandwiches    Chop cold boiled tongue very fine. To each cupful stir in two  tablespoonfuls of melted butter, dash of red pepper and about one-half  teaspoonful of onion juice. Have bread sufficiently stale to cut nicely.  Remove end crust, butter and cut a very thin slice; remove the crusts.  Spread it with the tongue paste, roll each sandwich carefully, tie with  narrow ribbon and put away until wanted. These can be made several hours  before serving.      Sandwich Dressing    Put four tablespoonfuls of vinegar and three of water into a saucepan  over the fire; add a half teaspoonful of salt and a half saltspoonful of  pepper. Beat the yolks of four eggs until creamy, add slowly to them the  hot mixture. Stir over hot water until it is the consistency of  mayonnaise dressing. Take from the fire and add carefully two level  tablespoonfuls of butter.      Farmer's Sandwiches    "]]]
