Furthermore, it was beginning to      rain. So, hurriedly breaking off the tale, we drove      back to Melrose across the green holms of St.      Boswells.        It was after the hour of tea, and the crowd of      visitors had ebbed away from the precincts of the      Abbey before the tale was resumed. A flat \"throuch\"      stone sustained the narrator, while the four      disposed themselves on the sunny grass, in the      various attitudes of severe inattention which youth      assumes when listening to a story. Sweetheart pored      into the depths of a buttercup. Hugh John scratched      the freestone of a half-buried tomb with a nail      till told to stop. Sir Toady Lion, having a      \"pinch-bug\" coralled in his palms, sat regarding it      cautiously between his thumbs. Only Maid Margaret,      her dimpled chin on her knuckles, sat looking      upward in rapt attention. For her there was no joy      like that of a story. Only, she was too young to      mind letting the tale-teller know it. That made the      difference.        Above our heads the beautiful ruin mounted, now all      red gold in the lights, and purple in the shadows,      while round and round, and through and through,      from highest tower to lowest arch, the swifts      shrieked and swooped.      THE SECOND TALE FROM \"WAVERLEY\"      I. THE CATTLE-LIFTING    NEXT morning (I continued, looking up for inspiration to the pinnacles  of Melrose, cut against the clear sky of evening, as sharply as when  \"John Morow, master mason,\" looked upon his finished work and found it  very good)--next morning, as Captain Edward Waverley was setting out for  his morning walk, he found the castle of Bradwardine by no means the  enchanted palace of silence he had first discovered. Milkmaids,  bare-legged and wild-haired, ran about distractedly with pails and  three-legged stools in their hands, crying, \"Lord, guide us!\" and \"Eh,  sirs!\"    Bailie Macwheeble, mounted on his dumpy, round-barrelled pony, rode  hither and thither with half the ragged rascals of the neighbourhood  clattering after him. The Baron paced the terrace, every moment glancing  angrily up at the Highland hills from under his bushy grey eyebrows.    From the byre-lasses and the Bailie, Edward could obtain no satisfactory  explanation of the disturbance. He judged it wiser not to seek it from  the angry Baron.    Within-doors, however, he found Rose, who, though troubled and anxious,  replied to his questions readily enough.    \"There has been a 'creach,' that is, a raid of cattle-stealers from out  of the Highland hills,\" she told him, hardly able to keep back her  tears--not, she explained, because of the lost cattle, but because she  feared that the anger of her father might end in the slaying of some of  the Caterans, and in a blood-feud which would last as long as they or  any of their family lived.    \"And all because my father is too proud to pay blackmail to Vich Ian  Vohr!\" she added.    \"Is the gentleman with that curious name,\" said Edward, \"a local robber  or a thief-taker?\"    \"Oh, no,\" Rose laughed outright at his southern ignorance, \"he is a  great Highland chief and a very handsome man. Ah, if only my father  would be friends with Fergus Mac-Ivor, then Tully-Veolan would once  again be a safe and happy home. He and my father quarrelled at a county  meeting about who should take the first place. In his heat he told my  father that he was under his banner and paid him tribute. But it was  Bailie Macwheeble who had paid the money without my father's knowledge.  And since then he and Vich Ian Vohr have not been friends.\"    \"But what is blackmail?\" Edward asked in astonishment. For he thought  that such things had been done away with long ago. All this was just  like reading an old black-letter book in his uncle's library.    \"It is money,\" Rose explained, \"which, if you live near the Highland  border, you must pay to the nearest powerful chief--such as Vich Ian  Vohr. And then, if your cattle are driven away, all you have to do is  just to send him word and he will have them sent back, or others as good  in their places. Oh, you do not know how dreadful to be at feud with a  man like Fergus Mac-Ivor. I was only a girl of ten when my father and  his servants had a skirmish with a party of them, near our home-farm--so  near, indeed, that some of the windows of the house were broken by the  bullets, and three of the Highland raiders were killed. I remember  seeing them brought in and laid on the floor in the hall, each wrapped  in his plaid. And next morning their wives and daughters came, clapping  their hands and crying the _coronach_ and shrieking--and they carried  away the dead bodies, with the pipes playing before them. Oh, I could  not sleep for weeks afterward, without starting up, thinking that I  heard again these terrible cries.\"    All this seemed like a dream to Waverley--to hear this young gentle girl  of seventeen talk familiarly of dark and bloody deeds, such as even he,  a grown man and a soldier, had only imagined--yet which she had seen  with her own eyes!    By dinner-time the Baron's mood had grown somewhat less stormy. He  seemed for the moment to forget his wounded honour, and was even  offering, as soon as the quarrel was made up, to provide Edward with  introductions to many powerful northern chiefs, when the door opened,  and a Highlander in full costume was shown in by the butler.    \"Welcome, Evan Dhu Maccombich!\" said the Baron, without rising, and  speaking in the manner of a prince receiving an embassy; \"what news from  Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr?\"    The ambassador delivered a courteous greeting from the Highland chief.  \"Fergus Mac-Ivor (he said) was sorry for the cloud that hung between him  and his ancient friend. He hoped that the Baron would be sorry too--and  that he should say so. More than this he did not ask.\"    This the Baron readily did, drinking to the health of the chief of the  Mac-Ivors, while Evan Maccombich in turn drank prosperity to the house  of Bradwardine.      II. THE ROBBER'S CAVE    Then these high matters being finished, the Highlander retired with  Bailie Macwheeble, doubtless to arrange with him concerning the arrears  of blackmail. But of that the Baron was supposed to know nothing. This  done, the Highlander began to ask all about the party which had driven  off the cattle, their appearance, whence they had come, and in what  place they had last been seen. Edward was much interested by the man's  shrewd questions and the quickness with which he arrived at his  conclusions. While on his part Evan Dhu was so flattered by the evident  interest of the young Englishman, that he invited him to \"take a walk  with him into the mountains in search of the cattle,\" promising him that  if the matter turned out as he expected, he would take Edward to such a  place as he had never seen before and might never have a chance of  seeing again.    Waverley accepted with eager joy, and though Rose Bradwardine turned  pale at the idea, the Baron, who loved boldness in the young, encouraged  the adventure. He gave Edward a young gamekeeper to carry his pack and  to be his attendant, so that he might make the journey with fitting  dignity.    Through a great pass, full of rugged rocks and seamed with roaring  torrents--indeed, the very pass of Bally-Brough in which the reivers had  last been spied--across weary and dangerous morasses, where Edward had  perforce to spring from tuft to tussock of coarse grass, Evan Dhu led  our hero into the depths of the wild Highland country,--where no Saxon  foot trod or dared to tread without the leave of Vich Ian Vohr, as the  chief's foster-brother took occasion to inform Edward more than once.    By this time night was coming on, and Edward's attendant was sent off  with one of Evan Dhu's men, that they might find a place to sleep in,  while Evan himself pushed forward to warn the supposed cattle-stealer,  one Donald Bean Lean, of the party's near approach. For, as Evan Dhu  said, the Cateran might very naturally be startled by the sudden  appearance of a _sidier roy_--or red soldier--in the very place of his  most secret retreat.    Edward was thus left alone with the single remaining Highlander, from  whom, however, he could obtain no further information as to his  journey's end--save that, as the Sassenach was somewhat tired, Donald  Bean might possibly send the _currach_ for him.    Edward wished much to know whether the _currach_ was a horse, a cart, or  a chaise. But in spite of all his efforts, he could get no more out of  the man with the Lochaber axe than the words repeated over and over  again, \"_Aich aye, ta currach! Aich aye, ta currach!_\"    However, after stumbling on a little farther, they came out on the  shores of a loch, and the guide, pointing through the darkness in the  direction of a little spark of light far away across the water, said,  \"Yon's ta cove!\" Almost at the same moment the dash of oars was heard,  and a shrill whistle came to their ears out of the darkness. This the  Highlander answered, and a boat appeared in which Edward was soon  seated, and on his way to the robber's cave.    The light, which at first had been no bigger than a rush-light, grew  rapidly larger, glowing red (as it seemed) upon the very bosom of the  lake. Cliffs began to rise above their heads, hiding the moon. And, as  the boat rapidly advanced, Edward could make out a great fire kindled on  the shore, into which dark mysterious figures were busily flinging pine  branches. The fire had been built on a narrow ledge at the opening of a  great black cavern, into which an inlet of the loch seemed to advance.  The men rowed straight for this black entrance. Then, letting the boat  run on with shipped oars, the fire was soon passed and left behind, and  the cavern entered through a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#5)"],[1,"was the special autumnal  household duty, and a hard one too, for the great kettles were tiresome  and heavy to handle. An early hour found the work well under way. A good  fire was started in the kitchen fireplace under two vast kettles, each  two feet, perhaps, in diameter, which were hung on trammels from the  lug-pole or crane, and half filled with boiling water and melted tallow,  which had had two scaldings and skimmings. At the end of the kitchen or  in an adjoining and cooler room, sometimes in the lean-to, two long  poles were laid from chair to chair or stool to stool. Across these  poles were placed at regular intervals, like the rounds of a ladder,  smaller sticks about fifteen or eighteen inches long, called  candle-rods. These poles and rods were kept from year to year, either in  the garret or up on the kitchen beams.    To each candle-rod was attached about six or eight carefully  straightened candle-wicks. The wicking was twisted strongly one way;  then doubled; then the loop was slipped over the candle-rod, when the  two ends, of course, twisted the other way around each other, making a  firm wick. A rod, with its row of wicks, was dipped in the melted tallow  in the pot, and returned to its place across the poles. Each row was  thus dipped in regular turn; each had time to cool and harden between  the dips, and thus grew steadily in size. If allowed to cool fast, they  of course grew quickly, but were brittle, and often cracked. Hence a  good worker dipped slowly, but if the room was fairly cool, could make  two hundred candles for a day's work. Some could dip two rods at a time.  The tallow was constantly replenished, as the heavy kettles were used  alternately to keep the tallow constantly melted, and were swung off and  on the fire. Boards or sheets of paper were placed under the rods to  protect the snowy, scoured floors.    Candles were also run in moulds which were groups of metal cylinders,  usually made of tin or pewter. Itinerant candle-makers went from house  to house, taking charge of candle-making in the household, and carrying  large candle-moulds with them. One of the larger size, making two dozen  candles, is here shown; but its companion, the smaller mould, making six  candles, is such as were more commonly seen. Each wick was attached to a  wire or a nail placed across the open top of the cylinder, and hung down  in the centre of each individual mould. The melted tallow was poured in  carefully around the wicks.    Wax candles also were made. They were often shaped by hand, by pressing  bits of heated wax around a wick. Farmers kept hives of bees as much for  the wax as for the honey, which was of much demand for sweetening, when  \"loaves\" of sugar were so high-priced. Deer suet, moose fat, bear's  grease, all were saved in frontier settlements, and carefully tried into  tallow for candles. Every particle of grease rescued from pot liquor, or  fat from meat, was utilized for candle-making. Rushlights were made by  stripping part of the outer bark from common rushes, thus leaving the  pith bare, then dipping them in tallow or grease, and letting them  harden.    The precious candles thus tediously made were taken good care of. They  were carefully packed in candle-boxes with compartments; were covered  over, and set in a dark closet, where they would not discolor and turn  yellow. A metal candle-box, hung on the edge of the kitchen  mantel-shelf, always held two or three candles to replenish those which  burnt out in the candlesticks.    A natural, and apparently inexhaustible, material for candles was found  in all the colonies in the waxy berries of the bayberry bush, which  still grows in large quantities on our coasts. In the year 1748 a  Swedish naturalist, Professor Kalm, came to America, and he wrote an  account of the bayberry wax which I will quote in full:--         \"There is a plant here from the berries of which they make a kind       of wax or tallow, and for that reason the Swedes call it the       tallow-shrub. The English call the same tree the candle-berry tree       or bayberry bush; it grows abundantly in a wet soil, and seems to       thrive particularly well in the neighborhood of the sea. The       berries look as if flour had been strewed on them. They are       gathered late in Autumn, being ripe about that time, and are thrown       into a kettle or pot full of boiling water; by this means their fat       melts out, floats at the top of the water, and may be skimmed off       into a vessel; with the skimming they go on till there is no tallow       left. The tallow, as soon as it is congealed, looks like common       tallow or wax, but has a dirty green color. By being melted over       and refined it acquires a fine and transparent green color. This       tallow is dearer than common tallow, but cheaper than wax. Candles       of this do not easily bend, nor melt in summer as common candles       do; they burn better and slower, nor do they cause any smoke, but       yield rather an agreeable smell when they are extinguished. In       Carolina they not only make candles out of the wax of the berries,       but likewise sealing-wax.\"    Beverley, the historian of Virginia, wrote of the smell of burning  bayberry tallow:--         \"If an accident puts a candle out, it yields a pleasant fragrancy       to all that are in the room; insomuch that nice people often put       them out on purpose to have the incense of the expiring snuff.\"    Bayberry wax was not only a useful home-product, but an article of  traffic till this century, and was constantly advertised in the  newspapers. In 1712, in a letter written to John Winthrop, F.R.S., I  find:--         \"I am now to beg one favour of you,--that you secure for me all the       bayberry wax you can possibly put your hands on. You must take a       care they do not put too much tallow among it, being a custom and       cheat they have got.\"    Bayberries were of enough importance to have some laws made about them.  Everywhere on Long Island grew the stunted bushes, and everywhere they  were valued. The town of Brookhaven, in 1687, forbade the gathering of  the berries before September 15, under penalty of fifteen shillings'  fine.    The pungent and unique scent of the bayberry, equally strong in leaf  and berry, is to me one of the elements of the purity and sweetness of  the air of our New England coast fields in autumn. It grows everywhere,  green and cheerful, in sun-withered shore pastures, in poor bits of  earth on our rocky coast, where it has few fellow field-tenants to crowd  the ground. It is said that the highest efforts of memory are stimulated  through our sense of smell, by the association of ideas with scents.  That of bayberry, whenever I pass it, seems to awaken in me an  hereditary memory, to recall a life of two centuries ago. I recall the  autumns of trial and of promise in our early history, and the bayberry  fields are peopled with children in Puritan garb, industriously  gathering the tiny waxen fruit. Equally full of sentiment is the scent  of my burning bayberry candles, which were made last autumn in an old  colony town.    The history of whale-fishing in New England is the history of one of the  most fascinating commercial industries the world has ever known. It is a  story with every element of intense interest, showing infinite romance,  adventure, skill, courage, and fortitude. It brought vast wealth to the  communities that carried on the fishing, and great independence and  comfort to the families of the whalers. To the whalemen themselves it  brought incredible hardships and dangers, yet they loved the life with  a love which is strange to view and hard to understand. In the oil made  from these \"royal fish\" the colonists found a vast and cheap supply for  their metal and glass lamps; while the toothed whales had stored in  their blunt heads a valuable material which was at once used for making  candles; it is termed, in the most ancient reference I have found to it  in New England records, Sperma-Coeti.    It was asserted that one of these spermaceti candles gave out more light  than three tallow candles, and had four times as big a flame. Soon their  manufacture and sale amounted to large numbers, and materially improved  domestic illumination.    All candles, whatever their material, were carefully used by the  economical colonists to the last bit by a little wire frame of pins and  rings called a save-all. Candle-sticks of various metals and shapes were  found in every house; and often sconces, which were also called  candle-arms, or prongs. Candle-beams were rude chandeliers, a metal or  wooden hoop with candle-holders. Snuffers were always seen, with which  to trim the candles, and snuffers trays. These were sometimes  exceedingly richly ornamented, and were often of silver: extinguishers  often accompanied the snuffers.    Though lamps occasionally appear on early inventories and lists of  sales, and though there was plenty of whale and fish oil to burn, lamps  were not extensively used in America for many years. \"Betty-lamps,\"  shaped much like antique Roman lamps, were the earliest form. They were  small, shallow receptacles, two or three inches in diameter and about an  inch in depth; either rectangular, oval, round, or triangular in shape,  with a projecting nose or spout an inch or two long. They usually had a  hook and chain by which they could be hung on a nail in the wall, or on  the round in the back of a chair; sometimes there was also a smaller  hook for cleaning out the nose of the lamp. They were filled with  tallow, grease, or oil, while a piece of cotton rag or coarse wick was  so placed that, when lighted, the end hung out on the nose. From this  wick, dripping dirty grease, rose a dull, smoky, ill-smelling flame.    Phoebe-lamps were similar in shape; though some had double wicks, that  is, a nose at either side. Three betty-lamps are shown in the "]]]
