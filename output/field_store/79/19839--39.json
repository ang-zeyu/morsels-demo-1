Their substance being rather soft and  yielding, and the winter rains pouring down with exceeding violence,  their sides are furrowed in many places with ravines, dug by the rushing  streams of rain-water. These streams of course wash down much of the  substance itself and carry it far into the plain, where it lies  scattered on the surface quite distinct from the soil. These washings  are found to consist not of earth or sand, but of rubbish, something  like that which lies in heaps wherever a house is being built or  demolished, and to contain innumerable fragments of bricks, pottery,  stone evidently worked by the hand and chisel; many of these fragments  moreover bearing inscriptions in complicated characters composed of one  curious figure shaped like the head of an arrow, and used in every  possible position and combination,--like this:    [Illustration: 1.--CUNEIFORM CHARACTERS.]    11. In the crevices or ravines themselves, the waters having cleared  away masses of this loose rubbish, have laid bare whole sides of walls  of solid brick-work, sometimes even a piece of a human head or limb, or  a corner of sculptured stone-slab, always of colossal size and bold,  striking execution. All this tells its own tale and the conclusion is  self-apparent: that these elevations are not natural hillocks or knolls,  but artificial mounds, heaps of earth and building materials which have  been at some time placed there by men, then, collapsing and crumbling to  rubbish from neglect, have concealed within their ample sides all that  remains of those ancient structures and works of art, clothed themselves  in verdure, and deceitfully assumed all the outward signs of natural  hills.    12. The Arabs never thought of exploring these curious heaps. Mohammedan  nations, as a rule, take little interest in relics of antiquity;  moreover they are very superstitious, and, as their religious law  strictly forbids them to represent the human form either in painting or  sculpture lest such reproduction might lead ignorant and misguided  people back to the abominations of idolatry, so they look on relics of  ancient statuary with suspicion amounting to fear and connect them with  magic and witchcraft. It is, therefore, with awe not devoid of horror  that they tell travellers that the mounds contain underground passages  which are haunted not only by wild beasts, but by evil spirits--for have  not sometimes strange figures carved in stone been dimly perceived in  the crevices? Better instructed foreigners have long ago assumed that  within these mounds must be entombed whatever ruins may be preserved of  the great cities of yore. Their number formed no objection, for it was  well known how populous the valley had been in the days of its splendor,  and that, besides several famous cities, it could boast no end of  smaller ones, often separated from each other by a distance of only a  few miles. The long low mounds were rightly supposed to represent the  ancient walls, and the higher and vaster ones to have been the site of  the palaces and temples. The Arabs, though utterly ignorant of history  of any kind, have preserved in their religion some traditions from the  Bible, and so it happens that out of these wrecks of ages some biblical  names still survive. Almost everything of which they do not know the  origin, they ascribe to Nimrod; and the smaller of the two mounds  opposite Mosul, which mark the spot where Nineveh itself once stood,  they call \"Jonah's Mound,\" and stoutly believe the mosque which crowns  it, surrounded by a comparatively prosperous village, to contain the  tomb of Jonah himself, the prophet who was sent to rebuke and warn the  wicked city. As the Mohammedans honor the Hebrew prophets, the whole  mound is sacred in their eyes in consequence.    13. If travellers had for some time been aware of these general facts  concerning the Mounds, it was many years before their curiosity and  interest were so far aroused as to make them go to the trouble and  expense of digging into them, in order to find out what they really  contained. Until within the last hundred years or so, not only the  general public, but even highly cultivated men and distinguished  scholars, under the words \"study of antiquity,\" understood no more than  the study of so-called \"_Classical_ Antiquity,\" i.e., of the language,  history and literature of the Greeks and Romans, together with the  ruins, works of art, and remains of all sorts left by these two nations.  Their knowledge of other empires and people they took from the Greek and  Roman historians and writers, without doubting or questioning their  statements, or--as we say now--without subjecting their statements to  any criticism. Moreover, European students in their absorption in and  devotion to classical studies, were too apt to follow the example of  their favorite authors and to class the entire rest of the world, as far  as it was known in ancient times, under the sweeping and somewhat  contemptuous by-name of \"Barbarians,\" thus allowing them but a secondary  importance and an inferior claim to attention.    14. Things began greatly to change towards the end of the last century.  Yet the mounds of Assyria and Babylonia were still suffered to keep  their secret unrevealed. This want of interest may be in part explained  by their peculiar nature. They are so different from other ruins. A row  of massive pillars or of stately columns cut out on the clear blue sky,  with the desert around or the sea at their feet,--a broken arch or  battered tombstone clothed with ivy and hanging creepers, with the blue  and purple mountains for a background, are striking objects which first  take the eye by their beauty, then invite inspection by the easy  approach they offer. But these huge, shapeless heaps! What labor to  remove even a small portion of them! And when that is done, who knows  whether their contents will at all repay the effort and expense?    15. The first European whose love of learning was strong enough to make  him disregard all such doubts and difficulties, was Mr. Rich, an  Englishman. He was not particularly successful, nor were his researches  very extensive, being carried on entirely with his private means; yet  his name will always be honorably remembered, for he was _the first_ who  went to work with pickaxe and shovel, who hired men to dig, who measured  and described some of the principal mounds on the Euphrates, thus laying  down the groundwork of all later and more fruitful explorations in that  region. It was in 1820 and Mr. Rich was then political resident or  representative of the East India Company at Baghdad. He also tried the  larger of the two mounds opposite Mosul, encouraged by the report that,  a short time before he arrived there, a sculpture representing men and  animals had been disclosed to view. Unfortunately he could not procure  even a fragment of this treasure, for the people of Mosul, influenced by  their _ulema_--(doctor of the law)--who had declared these sculptures to  be \"idols of the infidels,\" had walked across the river from the city in  a body and piously shattered them to atoms. Mr. Rich had not the good  luck to come across any such find himself, and after some further  efforts, left the place rather disheartened. He carried home to England  the few relics he had been able to obtain. In the absence of more  important ones, they were very interesting, consisting in fragments of  inscriptions, of pottery, in engraved stone, bricks and pieces of  bricks. After his death all these articles were placed in the British  Museum, where they formed the foundation of the present noble  Chaldea-Assyrian collection of that great institution. Nothing more was  undertaken for years, so that it could be said with literal truth that,  up to 1842, \"a case three feet square inclosed all that remained, not  only of the great city Nineveh, but of Babylon itself!\"[A]    16. The next in the field was Mr. Botta, appointed French Consul at  Mosul in 1842. He began to dig at the end of the same year, and  naturally attached himself specially to the larger of the two mounds  opposite Mosul, named KOYUNJIK, after a small village at its base. This  mound is the Mespila of Xenophon. He began enthusiastically, and worked  on for over three months, but repeated disappointments were beginning to  produce discouragement, when one day a peasant from a distant village  happened to be looking on at the small party of workmen. He was much  amused on observing that every--to him utterly worthless--fragment of  alabaster, brick or pottery, was carefully picked out of the rubbish,  most tenderly handled and laid aside, and laughingly remarked that they  might be better repaid for their trouble, if they would try the mound on  which his village was built, for that lots of such rubbish had kept  continually turning up, when they were digging the foundations of their  houses.    17. Mr. Botta had by this time fallen into a rather hopeless mood; yet  he did not dare to neglect the hint, and sent a few men to the mound  which had been pointed out to him, and which, as well as the village on  the top of it, bore the name of KHORSABAD. His agent began operations  from the top. A well was sunk into the mound, and very soon brought the  workmen to the top of a wall, which, on further digging, was found to be  lined along its base with sculptured slabs of some soft substance much  like gypsum or limestone. This discovery quickly brought Mr. Botta to  the spot, in a fever of excitement. He now took the direction of the  works himself, had a trench dug from the outside straight into the  mound, wide and deep, towards the place already laid open from above.  What was his astonishment on finding that he had entered a hall entirely  lined all round, except where interruptions indicated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24676"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Norway (#5)"],[1," stockings;  a bodice laced with silver, and covered with silver brooches and  other ornaments; a waistbelt, which is sometimes entirely of metal;  a kerchief tied over the head, after the fashion of the bandana of  West Indian negresses; and on occasions a shawl of many colours.    A step farther north, in what is called Lower Telemarken, a similar  kind of dress still exists, though the man's waistcoat-jacket is of  a somewhat different pattern and colour, and the women wear their  skirts a trifle longer. On Sundays and great occasions the latter  also put on cloth stockings and gloves, embroidered tastefully with  trails of flowers.    But such dresses as these are not the national costume of Norway. For  that we have to go still farther north--to the Hardanger. If an English  girl wishes to dress a doll as a typical Norwegian, the clothes would  be those of the Hardanger, and they would be these: a dark blue serge  skirt (to the ankles), trimmed with black velvet and silver braid;  a white chemisette with full sleeves; a red flannel bodice embroidered  with white, black, and silver, and glittering with brass saucer-shaped  ornaments; and a waistbelt adorned with metal buttons. The effect  is neat, bright, and decidedly piquant. The girls plait their fair  hair in two long tails, wearing a handkerchief as a head-dress; but  the married women have a most elaborate coiffure, something of the  sister-of-mercy type, consisting of the so-called _skaut_, or hood,  and the _lin_, or forehead band. It takes a considerable time to  put on, as the snow-white linen has to be most carefully stretched  over a frame, which is first fastened on the top of the head, and  then so arranged that the numerous small plaits hang in a particular  manner. This is the ordinary head-dress, though the country women  coming in to church on Sundays often wear curious old-fashioned  bonnets, which have the appearance of being heirlooms handed down  from generation to generation.    The men do not dress up to the women. They confine themselves  to a rough trouser suit, generally of dark blue, and a black felt  hat. Even amongst the older men of the Hardanger one seldom sees the  knee-breeches and stockings which used to be worn.            CHAPTER VI    SCHOOL AND PLAY      I am not certain whether Norse boys and girls are very good, or  whether they are spoilt. You may travel all day on a steamer with  a well-to-do family from the town, or you may live in a farmhouse  with a peasant's family for a month, and the chances are that you  will never hear the parents say \"Don't.\" One thing I am sure of: the  children who live in the country parts do very much as they please;  in the summer they go to bed when they feel tired, sometimes not  till nearly midnight; and they are not worried about getting their  boots and their clothes wet, because no Norwegian troubles his or her  head about such matters. Moreover, the life is such a simple one that  perhaps there is little opportunity for real naughtiness.    These country children have a very easy time, as for the greater part  of the year they have no school to go to, and they spend all the  summer out in the open air, looking after the ponies, cows, sheep,  or goats, or hay-making, or rowing about, or fishing, or something  of the kind. In the winter they, as well as the town children,  are all obliged to go to school, from the age of seven to fourteen  or fifteen--_i.e.,_ until their Confirmation, and until this takes  place they receive religious instruction from the priest on Sunday  afternoons, for there is no religious teaching in the schools.    There is a great difficulty about the country schools, because in  some districts the farms are miles and miles apart, and it would be  quite impossible for the children to walk to school and back in the  day. In such districts the Government schoolmasters have to go about  from place to place, and teach the children in their own homes. If  there should be two or three farms close together, one of the farmers  provides a schoolroom in his house, and the schoolmaster lives with  him as his guest for a time, and then goes on to another house. But  the schoolmasters must give every child twelve weeks' schooling in  the year. This does not amount to a great deal--only three months of  school in the year!    The wonder is that the children contrive to remember anything that  they have learned, with nine long months in which to forget it. Yet  they work hard while they are about it; they are inspected every  year, and they are required to pass quite difficult examinations at  the end. It is expected, however, that before long the twelve weeks'  compulsory schooling will be increased to fifteen weeks.    In the towns the children are not forced to attend school for more than  the twelve weeks in the year, but there are, of course, numbers of  private schools, high schools, etc., to which parents can send their  children, on payment, for a superior education. And at such schools  the work goes on for a much longer period of the year--in fact, all  through the year, except for two months in the summer and a week at  Christmas and at Easter.    It is all much the same as our own arrangements in England. There  is the Government school, where the education is free, and there are  other schools, where a higher education is paid for. But the compulsory  schooling does not end with the seven years at the Government schools  referred to above, for there are continuation schools, at which the  pupils have to put in a further twenty-four weeks.    In Norway there are no large public schools for boarders, so, in spite  of their long holidays, the children do not have half the fun that  English boys and girls have. There is no cricket, football, hockey,  golf, or any game of that sort, and there is not a racquet-, fives-,  or tennis-court in the land. How then, you will ask, do they manage  to amuse themselves?    It must be remembered that the winter is much longer in Norway than it  is with us, and even if the boys wanted to play football they would not  be able to do so, as the ground is covered with snow. At that season  they have their various winter sports to keep them busy--ski-ing,  skating, tobogganing, and the like, and they do not require any other  games. In the summer, instead of playing cricket, they go for walking  tours into the mountains, or they go fishing in the rivers and lakes,  or sometimes shooting.    Though the Norwegians boast that ball games have been played in the  country since Saga times, such games are of the most elementary kind,  and would be scorned by any English boy. But for all that the Norse  boys are every bit as manly as any other boys, because they enjoy  many forms of sport which make them so; and they are strong, because  they take plenty of exercise, and have physical drill in their schools.    This brings us to other games played by Norwegian children--not the  games which are purchased in the shops in Christiania, Bergen, and  other towns, but the games which are played without any of the bought  things. Of course the girls have dolls and dolls' houses and dolls'  tea-parties, like the girls of every land, and there are toys of  every description in the shops. The peasant children, however, who  live far out in the country, never see a shop, and have to provide  themselves with things to play with; but it is wonderful what an  amount of amusement they can get out of an old bone, or a block of  wood, tied to a yard or two of string.    As a rule their fathers are good hands at carving wood, so toys are  easily made for the smaller children, and one finds everywhere such  simple toys as wooden dolls, animals, miniature boats, sleighs,  and carts.    But the real enjoyment of the Norwegian children--at any rate of the  girls--is the outdoor game, played when the weather is fine, both  in the town and in the country, wherever there are enough children  to make a game. To see a bevy of these quaint little girls throwing  heart and soul into their games is delightful, and they have scores  and scores of different ones. In most of them dancing and singing play  a great part, and the most popular form of game is what is called a  \"Ring Dance,\" in which, as the name implies, the players join hands  and dance round in a circle.    Many of these ring dances have their counterpart in English games,  and the tunes and words sung to them are almost similar. Whether we  adopted them from the Norwegians, or they adopted them from us, is a  matter which will probably never be decided, but several games of this  kind are common to all Europe. \"Blind Man's Buff,\" \"Hunt the Slipper,\"  and \"Forfeits,\" for instance, are found nearly everywhere. Here  is the Norse version of \"Round and round the Mulberry Bush,\" which  in some parts is called \"The Washing-Maids' Dance,\" and in others  \"Round the Juniper Bush\":          \"So we go round the juniper bush, the juniper bush, the juniper                                                              bush,      So we go round the juniper bush early on Monday morning.      This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes, wash                                                          our clothes,      This is the way we wash our clothes early on Monday morning.        \"So we go round the juniper bush, the juniper bush, the juniper                                                              bush,      So we go round the juniper bush early on Tuesday morning.      This is the way we ring out our clothes, ring out our clothes,                                                  ring out our clothes,      This is the way we ring out our clothes early on Tuesday morning.\"      The washing operations proceed through the next three days of the week,  with a verse to each day. Thus on Wednesday they hang up the clothes,  on Thursday they mangle them, and on Friday iron them. Then on Saturday  they scrub"]]]
