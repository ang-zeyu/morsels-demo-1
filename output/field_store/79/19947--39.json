We will take advantage of the confusion  to get aboard.\"    This answer did nothing to settle Jason's mind, but he let it slide for  the moment. \"All right--say we _do_ get aboard. Why don't they just  prevent take-off until we have been dragged out and stood against a  wall?\"    Kerk spared him a contemptuous glance before he returned his eyes to the  road. \"I said the ship was the _Pride of Darkhan_. If you had studied  this system at all, you would know what that means. Cassylia and Darkhan  are sister planets and rivals in every way. It has been less than two  centuries since they fought an intra-system war that almost destroyed  both of them. Now they exist in an armed-to-the-teeth neutrality that  neither dare violate. The moment we set foot aboard the ship we are on  Darkhan territory. There is no extradition agreement between the  planets. Cassylia may want us--but not badly enough to start another  war.\"    That was all the explanation there was time for. Kerk swung the car out  of the rush of traffic and onto a bridge marked _Official Cars Only_.  Jason had a feeling of nakedness as they rolled under the harsh port  lights towards the guarded gate ahead.    It was closed.    Another car approached the gate from the inside and Kerk slowed their  car to a crawl. One of the guards talked to the driver of the car inside  the port, then waved to the gate attendant. The barrier gate began to  swing inwards and Kerk jammed down on the accelerator.    Everything happened at once. The turbine howled, the spinning tires  screeched on the road and the car crashed open the gate. Jason had a  vanishing glimpse of the open-mouthed guards, then they were skidding  around the corner of a building. A few shots popped after them, but none  came close.    Driving with one hand, Kerk reached under the dash and pulled out a gun  that was the twin of the monster strapped to his arm. \"Use this instead  of your own,\" he said. \"Rocket-propelled explosive slugs. Make a great  bang. Don't bother shooting at anyone--I'll take care of that. Just stir  up a little action and make them keep their distance. Like this.\"    He fired a single, snap-shot out the side window and passed the gun to  Jason almost before the slug hit. An empty truck blew up with a roar,  raining pieces on the cars around and sending their drivers fleeing in  panic.    After that it was a nightmare ride through a madhouse. Kerk drove with  an apparent contempt for violent death. Other cars followed them and  were lost in wheel-raising turns. They careened almost the full length  of the field, leaving a trail of smoking chaos.    Then the pursuit was all behind them and the only thing ahead was the  slim spire of the _Pride of Darkhan_.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Pride_ was surrounded by a strong wire fence as suited the  begrudged status of her planetary origin. The gate was closed and  guarded by soldiers with leveled guns, waiting for a shot at the  approaching car. Kerk made no attempt to come near them. Instead he fed  the last reserves of power to the car and headed for the fence. \"Cover  your face,\" he shouted.    Jason put his arms in front of his head just as they hit.    Torn metal screamed, the fence buckled, wrapped itself around the car,  but did not break. Jason flew off the seat and into the padded dash. By  the time Kerk had the warped door open, he realized that the ride was  over. Kerk must have seen the spin of his eyeballs because he didn't  talk, just pulled Jason out and threw him onto the hood of the ruined  car.    \"Climb over the buckled wire and make a run for the ship,\" he shouted.    If there was any doubt what he meant, he set Jason an example of fine  roadwork. It was inconceivable that someone of his bulk could run so  fast, yet he did. He moved more like a charging tank than a man. Jason  shook the fog from his head and worked up some speed himself.  Nevertheless, he was barely halfway to the ship when Kerk hit the  gangway. It was already unhooked from the ship, but the shocked  attendants stopped rolling it away as the big man bounded up the steps.    [Illustration]    At the top he turned and fired at the soldiers who were charging through  the open gate. They dropped, crawled, and returned his fire. Very few  shot at Jason's running form.    The scene in front of Jason cranked over in slow motion. Kerk standing  at the top of the ramp, coolly returning the fire that splashed all  about. He could have found safety in an instant through the open port  behind him. The only reason he stayed there was to cover Jason.    \"Thanks--\" Jason managed to gasp as he made the last few steps up the  gangway, jumped the gap and collapsed inside the ship.    \"You're perfectly welcome,\" Kerk said as he joined him, waving his gun  to cool it off.    A grim-jawed ship's officer stood back out of range of fire from the  ground and looked them both up and down. \"And just what is going on  here?\" he growled.    Kerk tested the barrel with a wet thumb, then let the gun slide back  into its holster. \"We are law-abiding citizens of a different system who  have committed no criminal acts. The savages of Cassylia are too  barbarous for civilized company. Therefore we are going to Darkhan--here  are our tickets--in whose sovereign territory I believe we are at this  moment.\" This last was added for the benefit of the Cassylian officer  who had just stumbled to the top of the gangway and was raising his gun.    The soldier couldn't be blamed. He saw these badly wanted criminals  getting away. Aboard a Darkhan ship as well. Anger got the best of him  and he brought his gun up.    \"Come out of there, you scum. You're not escaping that easily. Come out  slow with your hands up or I'll blast you--\"    It was a frozen moment of time that stretched and stretched without  breaking. The pistol covered Kerk and Jason. Neither of them attempted  to reach for their own guns.    The gun twitched a bit as the ship's officer moved, then steadied back  on the two men. The Darkhan spaceman hadn't gone far, just a pace across  the lock. This was enough to bring him next to a red box set flush with  the wall. With a single, swift gesture he flipped up the cover and  poised his thumb over the button inside. When he smiled his lips peeled  back to show all of his teeth. He had made up his mind, and it was the  arrogance of the Cassylian officer that had been the deciding factor.    \"Fire a single shot into Darkhan territory and I press this button,\" he  shouted. \"And you know what this button does--every one of your ships  has them as well. Commit a hostile act against this ship and _someone_  will press a button. Every control rod will be blown out of the ship's  pile at that instant and half your filthy city will go up in the  explosion.\" His smile was chiseled on his face and there was no doubt he  would do what he said. \"Go ahead--fire. I think I would enjoy pressing  this.\"    The take-off siren was hooting now, the _close lock_ light blinking an  angry message from the bridge. Like four actors in a grim drama they  faced each other an instant more.    Then the Cassylian officer, growling with unvoicable frustrated anger,  turned and leaped back to the steps.    \"All passengers board ship. Forty-five seconds to take-off. Clear the  port.\" The ship's officer slammed shut the cover of the box and locked  it as he talked. There was barely time to make the acceleration couches  before the _Pride of Darkhan_ cleared ground.          V.      Once the ship was in orbit the captain sent for Jason and Kerk. Kerk  took the floor and was completely frank about the previous night's  activities. The only fact of importance he left out was Jason's  background as a professional gambler. He drew a beautiful picture of  two lucky strangers whom the evil forces of Cassylia wanted to deprive  of their gambling profits. All this fitted perfectly the captain's  preconceptions of Cassylia. In the end he congratulated his officer on  the correctness of his actions and began the preparation of a long  report to his government. He gave the two men his best wishes as well as  the liberty of the ship.    It was a short trip. Jason barely had time to catch up on his sleep  before they grounded on Darkhan. Being without luggage they were the  first ones through customs. They left the shed just in time to see  another ship landing in a distant pit. Kerk stopped to watch it and  Jason followed his gaze. It was a gray, scarred ship. With the stubby  lines of a freighter--but sporting as many guns as a cruiser.    \"Yours, of course,\" Jason said.    Kerk nodded and started towards the ship. One of the locks opened as  they came up but no one appeared. Instead a remote-release folding  ladder rattled down to the ground. Kerk swarmed up it and Jason followed  glumly. Somehow, he felt, this was overdoing the no-frills-and-nonsense  attitude.    Jason was catching on to Pyrran ways though. The reception aboard ship  for the ambassador was just what he expected. Nothing. Kerk closed the  lock himself and they found couches as the take-off horn sounded. The  main jets roared and acceleration smashed down on Jason.    It didn't stop. Instead it grew stronger, squeezing the air out of his  lungs and the sight from his eyes. He screamed but couldn't hear his own  voice through the roaring in his ears. Mercifully he blacked out.    When consciousness returned the ship was at zero-G. Jason kept his eyes  closed and let the pain seep out of his body. Kerk spoke suddenly, he  was standing next to the couch.    \"My fault, Meta, I should have told you we had a 1-G passenger aboard.  You might have eased up a bit on your usual bone-breaking take-off.\"    \"It doesn't seem to have harmed him much--but what's he doing here?\"    Jason felt mild"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28402"],[0,"The Sexual Life of the Child (#5)"],[1,"in our knowledge.    A certain amount of material is to be found in a number of books on  zoology, and also in a few quite recent works on comparative psychology.  Among works of the former class I mention especially that of Brehm, who  has reported a considerable number of individual details; of books on  comparative psychology, one of the most useful for our purposes is that  of Groos,[6] who gives us much valuable information regarding love-games  of young animals.    I may also point out that in the autobiographies, biographies, memoirs,  &c., of celebrated persons, we find much information regarding premature  amatory sentiments. Goethe, in his _Wahrheit und Dichtung_, relates that  as a boy of ten or so he fell in love with a young Frenchwoman, the  sister of his friend Derones. Of Alfred de Musset, his brother and  biographer, Paul Musset, records that at the early age of four he was  passionately in love with a girl cousin. It is on record that Dante fell  in love at the age of nine, Canova at five, and Alfieri at ten. Well  known also is the story of Byron's love, at eight years of age, for Mary  Duff. Moebius tells us of himself that when a boy of ten he was  desperately enamoured of a young married woman. We are told of Napoleon  I. that when a boy of nine he fell in love with his father's cousin, a  handsome woman of thirty, then on a visit to his home, and that he  caressed her in the most passionate manner. Belonging to an earlier day  was Felix Platter, the celebrated Swiss physician of the sixteenth  century, who tells us in his autobiography that when he was a child he  loved to be kissed by a certain young married woman. In _Un Coeur  Simple_, Flaubert describes the development of the love-sentiments. \"For  mankind there is so much love in life. At the age of four we love  horses, the sun, flowers, shining weapons, uniforms; at ten we love a  little girl, our playmate; at thirteen we love a buxom, full-necked  woman. The first time I saw the two breasts of a woman, entirely  unclothed, I almost fainted. Finally, at the age of fourteen or fifteen,  we love a young girl, who is a little more to us than a sister and a  little less than a mistress; and then, at sixteen, we love a woman once  more, and marry her.\"    Most charmingly Hebbel describes his first experience of love, when but  four years old. \"It was in Susanna's dull schoolroom, also, that I  learned the meaning of love; it was, indeed, in the very hour when I  first entered it, at the age of four. First love! Who is there who will  not smile as he reads these words? Who will fail to recall memories of  some Anne or Margaret, who once seemed to him to wear a crown of stars,  and to be clad in the blue of heaven and the gold of dawn; and now--but  it would be malicious to depict the contrast! Who will fail to admit  that it seemed to him then as if he passed on the wing through the  garden of the earth, flitting from flower to flower, sipping from their  honey-cups; passing too swiftly, indeed, to become intoxicated, but  pausing long enough at each to inhale its divine perfume!... It was some  time before I ventured to raise my eyes, for I felt that I was under  inspection, and this embarrassed me. But at length I looked up, and my  first glance fell upon a pale and slender girl who sat opposite me: her  name was Emily, and she was the daughter of the parish-clerk. A  passionate trembling seized me, the blood rushed to my heart; but a  sentiment of shame was also intermingled with my first sensations, and I  lowered my eyes to the ground once more, as rapidly as if I had caught  sight of something horrible. From that moment Emily was ever in my  thoughts; and the school, so greatly dreaded in anticipation, became a  joy to me, because it was there only that I could see her. The Sundays  and holidays which separated me from her were as greatly detested by me  as in other circumstances they would have been greatly desired; one day  when she stayed away from school, I felt utterly miserable. In  imagination she was always before my eyes, wherever I went; when alone,  I was never weary of repeating her name; above all, her black eyebrows  and intensely red lips were ever before my eyes, whereas I do not  remember that at this time her voice had made any impression on me,  although later this became all-important.\"    In belletristic literature, also, we find occasional references to the  love-sentiment in childhood. Groos refers to an instance which he thinks  perhaps the most delicate known to him, and one in which the erotic  element is but faintly emphasised, namely, Gottfried Keller's _Romeo und  Julia_. \"In a spot entirely covered with green undergrowth the girl  stretched herself on her back, for she was tired, and began in a  monotonous tone to sing a few words, repeating the same ones over and  over again; the boy crouched close beside her, half inclined, he also,  to stretch himself at full length on the ground, so lethargic did he  feel. The sun shone into the girl's open mouth as she sang, lighting up  her glistening white teeth, and gleaming on her full red lips. The boy  caught sight of her teeth, and, holding the girl's head and eagerly  examining her teeth, said, 'Tell me, how many teeth has one?' The girl  paused for a moment, as if thinking the matter carefully over, but then  answered at random, 'A hundred.' 'No!' he cried; 'thirty-two is the  proper number; wait a moment, I'll count yours.' He counted them, but  could not get the tale right to thirty-two, and so counted them again,  and again, and again. The girl let him go on for some time, but as he  did not come to an end of his eager counting, she suddenly interrupted  him, and said, 'Now, let me count yours.' The boy lay down in his turn  on the undergrowth; the girl leaned over him, with her arm round his  head; he opened his mouth, and she began counting: 'One, two, seven,  five, two, one,' for the little beauty did not yet know how to count.  The boy corrected her, and explained to her how to count properly; so  she, in her turn, attempted to count his teeth over and over again: and  this game seemed to please them more than any they had played together  that day. At last, however, the girl sank down on her youthful  instructor's breast, and the two children fell asleep in the bright  midday sunshine.\"    In erotic literature we also occasionally find descriptions belonging to  our province, as, for instance, in the _Satyricon_ of Petronius Arbiter.  Indeed, a certain kind of erotic literature, more especially  pornographic literature, selects this subject by preference. Thus, I may  allude to the _Anti-Justine_ of Retif de la Bretonne. In a certain  section of such literature, improper practices between children and  their parents and other blood relatives play a part.    Recently, in connexion with two different fields of study, attention has  been directed to the sexual life of the child. The first of these is  concerned with the abnormal, and especially the perverse, manifestations  of the sexual life, a study of which Westphal, and above all von  Krafft-Ebing, have been the founders. The other is the modern movement  in favour of the sexual enlightenment of children. As regards the  latter, the literature to which it has given rise has not, indeed,  contributed much, beyond a few casual references, in the way of positive  material concerning the sexual life of the child. But none the less, it  is this movement which has made it of prime importance that our subject  should be carefully investigated. As regards studies of the  abnormalities of the sexual impulse, under the name of _paradoxical  sexual impulse_ cases have been published in which that impulse  manifested itself at an age of life in which it is normally  non-existent--old age and childhood. Recent research has brought to  light a large number of cases of this nature. Among those who have  reported such cases, we must mention first of all von Krafft-Ebing, and  in addition, Fere, Fuchs, Pelofi, and Lombroso.    In addition to these various works, others must be mentioned which have  arisen mainly out of the recently awakened interest in the sexual life;  for example, works on puberty, the psychology of love, and similar  topics. In his _Fisiologia del Amore_ (_Physiology of Love_), Mantegazza  emphasises the love-manifestations of childhood. The same may be said of  many other general works on the sexual life, and more especially, as  previously mentioned, of works on prostitution. Certain works on  offences against morality have also enriched our knowledge in this  province.    It might at first sight appear from what has been said that the  literature of the sexual life of the child was extremely voluminous, but  this is not in reality the case. Almost always, this important question  is handled in a casual or cursory manner. A thorough presentation of the  subject has not, as far as my knowledge extends, hitherto been  attempted. Freud rightly insists that even in all, or nearly all, the  works on the psychology of the child, this important department is  ignored. Quite recently, indeed, special works have appeared upon the  sexual life of the child, among which I must first of all mention  Freud's own contribution to the subject, forming part of his _Drei  Abhandlungen zur sexuellen Theorie_ (_Three Essays on the Sexual  Theory_, Leipzig and Vienna, 1905).[7] But what this writer describes as  an indication of infantile sexuality, viz., certain sucking movements,  has, in my opinion, nothing to do with the sexual life of the child--as  little to do with sexuality as have the functions of the stomach or any  other non-genital organ. A number of other processes occurring in  childhood, which Freud and his followers have recently described as  sexual in nature, and as playing a great part later in life in connexion  with hysteria, neurasthenia, compulsion-neuroses, the anxiety-neurosis,"]]]
