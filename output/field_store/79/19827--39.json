There are few bishops, deans,  or other dignitaries, but imagine they are so _jure divino_; it is  consequently a great mortification to them to be obliged to confess that  they owe their dignity to a pitiful law enacted by a set of profane  laymen.  A learned monk (Father Courayer) wrote a book lately to prove  the validity and succession of English ordinations.  This book was forbid  in France, but do you believe that the English Ministry were pleased with  it?  Far from it.  Those wicked Whigs don't care a straw whether the  episcopal succession among them hath been interrupted or not, or whether  Bishop Parker was consecrated (as it is pretended) in a tavern or a  church; for these Whigs are much better pleased that the Bishops should  derive their authority from the Parliament than from the Apostles.  The  Lord Bolingbroke observed that this notion of divine right would only  make so many tyrants in lawn sleeves, but that the laws made so many  citizens.    With regard to the morals of the English clergy, they are more regular  than those of France, and for this reason.  All the clergy (a very few  excepted) are educated in the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, far  from the depravity and corruption which reign in the capital.  They are  not called to dignities till very late, at a time of life when men are  sensible of no other passion but avarice, that is, when their ambition  craves a supply.  Employments are here bestowed both in the Church and  the army, as a reward for long services; and we never see youngsters made  bishops or colonels immediately upon their laying aside the academical  gown; and besides most of the clergy are married.  The stiff and awkward  air contracted by them at the University, and the little familiarity the  men of this country have with the ladies, commonly oblige a bishop to  confine himself to, and rest contented with, his own.  Clergymen  sometimes take a glass at the tavern, custom giving them a sanction on  this occasion; and if they fuddle themselves it is in a very serious  manner, and without giving the least scandal.    That fable-mixed kind of mortal (not to be defined), who is neither of  the clergy nor of the laity; in a word, the thing called _Abbe_ in  France; is a species quite unknown in England.  All the clergy here are  very much upon the reserve, and most of them pedants.  When these are  told that in France young fellows famous for their dissoluteness, and  raised to the highest dignities of the Church by female intrigues,  address the fair publicly in an amorous way, amuse themselves in writing  tender love songs, entertain their friends very splendidly every night at  their own houses, and after the banquet is ended withdraw to invoke the  assistance of the Holy Ghost, and call themselves boldly the successors  of the Apostles, they bless God for their being Protestants.  But these  are shameless heretics, who deserve to be blown hence through the flames  to old Nick, as Rabelais says, and for this reason I do not trouble  myself about them.        LETTER VI.--ON THE PRESBYTERIANS      The Church of England is confined almost to the kingdom whence it  received its name, and to Ireland, for Presbyterianism is the established  religion in Scotland.  This Presbyterianism is directly the same with  Calvinism, as it was established in France, and is now professed at  Geneva.  As the priests of this sect receive but very inconsiderable  stipends from their churches, and consequently cannot emulate the  splendid luxury of bishops, they exclaim very naturally against honours  which they can never attain to.  Figure to yourself the haughty Diogenes  trampling under foot the pride of Plato.  The Scotch Presbyterians are  not very unlike that proud though tattered reasoner.  Diogenes did not  use Alexander half so impertinently as these treated King Charles II.;  for when they took up arms in his cause in opposition to Oliver, who had  deceived them, they forced that poor monarch to undergo the hearing of  three or four sermons every day, would not suffer him to play, reduced  him to a state of penitence and mortification, so that Charles soon grew  sick of these pedants, and accordingly eloped from them with as much joy  as a youth does from school.    A Church of England minister appears as another Cato in presence of a  juvenile, sprightly French graduate, who bawls for a whole morning  together in the divinity schools, and hums a song in chorus with ladies  in the evening; but this Cato is a very spark when before a Scotch  Presbyterian.  The latter affects a serious gait, puts on a sour look,  wears a vastly broad-brimmed hat and a long cloak over a very short coat,  preaches through the nose, and gives the name of the whore of Babylon to  all churches where the ministers are so fortunate as to enjoy an annual  revenue of five or six thousand pounds, and where the people are weak  enough to suffer this, and to give them the titles of my lord, your  lordship, or your eminence.    These gentlemen, who have also some churches in England, introduced there  the mode of grave and severe exhortations.  To them is owing the  sanctification of Sunday in the three kingdoms.  People are there  forbidden to work or take any recreation on that day, in which the  severity is twice as great as that of the Romish Church.  No operas,  plays, or concerts are allowed in London on Sundays, and even cards are  so expressly forbidden that none but persons of quality, and those we  call the genteel, play on that day; the rest of the nation go either to  church, to the tavern, or to see their mistresses.    Though the Episcopal and Presbyterian sects are the two prevailing ones  in Great Britain, yet all others are very welcome to come and settle in  it, and live very sociably together, though most of their preachers hate  one another almost as cordially as a Jansenist damns a Jesuit.    Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable than  many courts of justice, where the representatives of all nations meet for  the benefit of mankind.  There the Jew, the Mahometan, and the Christian  transact together, as though they all professed the same religion, and  give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts.  There the Presbyterian  confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker's  word.    If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very  possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut  one another's throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live  happy and in peace.        LETTER VII.--ON THE SOCINIANS, OR ARIANS, OR ANTITRINITARIANS      There is a little sect here composed of clergymen, and of a few very  learned persons among the laity, who, though they do not call themselves  Arians or Socinians, do yet dissent entirely from St. Athanasius with  regard to their notions of the Trinity, and declare very frankly that the  Father is greater than the Son.    Do you remember what is related of a certain orthodox bishop, who, in  order to convince an emperor of the reality of consubstantiation, put his  hand under the chin of the monarch's son, and took him by the nose in  presence of his sacred majesty?  The emperor was going to order his  attendants to throw the bishop out of the window, when the good old man  gave him this handsome and convincing reason: \"Since your majesty,\" says  he, \"is angry when your son has not due respect shown him, what  punishment do you think will God the Father inflict on those who refuse  His Son Jesus the titles due to Him?\"  The persons I just now mentioned  declare that the holy bishop took a very wrong step, that his argument  was inconclusive, and that the emperor should have answered him thus:  \"Know that there are two ways by which men may be wanting in respect to  me--first, in not doing honour sufficient to my son; and, secondly, in  paying him the same honour as to me.\"    Be this as it will, the principles of Arius begin to revive, not only in  England, but in Holland and Poland.  The celebrated Sir Isaac Newton  honoured this opinion so far as to countenance it.  This philosopher  thought that the Unitarians argued more mathematically than we do.  But  the most sanguine stickler for Arianism is the illustrious Dr. Clark.  This man is rigidly virtuous, and of a mild disposition, is more fond of  his tenets than desirous of propagating them, and absorbed so entirely in  problems and calculations that he is a mere reasoning machine.    It is he who wrote a book which is much esteemed and little understood,  on the existence of God, and another, more intelligible, but pretty much  contemned, on the truth of the Christian religion.    He never engaged in scholastic disputes, which our friend calls venerable  trifles.  He only published a work containing all the testimonies of the  primitive ages for and against the Unitarians, and leaves to the reader  the counting of the voices and the liberty of forming a judgment.  This  book won the doctor a great number of partisans, and lost him the See of  Canterbury; but, in my humble opinion, he was out in his calculation, and  had better have been Primate of all England than merely an Arian parson.    You see that opinions are subject to revolutions as well as empires.  Arianism, after having triumphed during three centuries, and been forgot  twelve, rises at last out of its own ashes; but it has chosen a very  improper season to make its appearance in, the present age being quite  cloyed with disputes and sects.  The members of this sect are, besides,  too few to be indulged the liberty of holding public assemblies, which,  however, they will, doubtless, be permitted to do in case they spread  considerably.  But people are now so very cold with respect to all things  of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24461"],[0,"Third class in Indian railways (#5)"],[1,"false hopes.    With Sir Daniel Hamilton it has become a religion. On the 13th January  last, he addressed the students of the Scottish Churches College and,  in order to point a moral, he instanced Scotland's poverty of two  hundred years ago and showed how that great country was raised from a  condition of poverty to plenty. \"There were two powers, which raised  her--the Scottish Church and the Scottish banks. The Church manufactured  the men and the banks manufactured the money to give the men a start in  life.... The Church disciplined the nation in the fear of God which is  the beginning of wisdom and in the parish schools of the Church the  children learned that the chief end of man's life was to glorify God and  to enjoy Him for ever. Men were trained to believe in God and in  themselves, and on the trustworthy character so created the Scottish  banking system was built.\" Sir Daniel then shows that it was possible to  build up the marvellous Scottish banking system only on the character so  built. So far there can only be perfect agreement with Sir Daniel, for  that 'without character there is no co-operation' is a sound maxim. But  he would have us go much further. He thus waxes eloquent on  co-operation: \"Whatever may be your daydreams of India's future, never  forget this that it is to weld India into one, and so enable her to take  her rightful place in the world, that the British Government is here;  and the welding hammer in the hand of the Government is the co-operative  movement.\" In his opinion it is the panacea of all the evils that  afflict India at the present moment. In its extended sense it can  justify the claim on one condition which need not be mentioned here; in  the limited sense in which Sir Daniel has used it, I venture to think,  it is an enthusiast's exaggeration. Mark his peroration: \"Credit, which  is only Trust and Faith, is becoming more and more the money power of  the world, and in the parchment bullet into which is impressed the faith  which removes mountains, India will find victory and peace.\" Here there  is evident confusion of thought. The credit which is becoming the money  power of the world has little moral basis and is not a synonym for  Trust or Faith, which are purely moral qualities. After twenty years'  experience of hundreds of men, who had dealings with banks in South  Africa, the opinion I had so often heard expressed has become firmly  rooted in me, that the greater the rascal the greater the credit he  enjoys with his banks. The banks do not pry into his moral character:  they are satisfied that he meets his overdrafts and promissory notes  punctually. The credit system has encircled this beautiful globe of ours  like a serpent's coil, and if we do not mind, it bids fair to crush us  out of breath. I have witnessed the ruin of many a home through the  system, and it has made no difference whether the credit was labelled  co-operative or otherwise. The deadly coil has made possible the  devastating spectacle in Europe, which we are helplessly looking on. It  was perhaps never so true as it is today that, as in law so in war, the  longest purse finally wins. I have ventured to give prominence to the  current belief about credit system in order to emphasise the point that  the co-operative movement will be a blessing to India only to the extent  that it is a moral movement strictly directed by men fired with  religious fervour. It follows, therefore, that co-operation should be  confined to men wishing to be morally right, but failing to do so,  because of grinding poverty or of the grip of the Mahajan. Facility for  obtaining loans at fair rates will not make immoral men moral. But the  wisdom of the Estate or philanthropists demands that they should help on  the onward path, men struggling to be good.    Too often do we believe that material prosperity means moral growth. It  is necessary that a movement which is fraught with so much good to India  should not degenerate into one for merely advancing cheap loans. I was  therefore delighted to read the recommendation in the Report of the  Committee on Co-operation in India, that \"they wish clearly to express  their opinion that it is to true co-operation alone, that is, to a  co-operation which recognises the moral aspect of the question that  Government must look for the amelioration of the masses and not to a  pseudo-co-operative edifice, however imposing, which is built in  ignorance of co-operative principles.\" With this standard before us, we  will not measure the success of the movement by the number of  co-operative societies formed, but by the moral condition of the  co-operators. The registrars will, in that event, ensure the moral  growth of existing societies before multiplying them. And the Government  will make their promotion conditional, not upon the number of societies  they have registered, but the moral success of the existing  institutions. This will mean tracing the course of every pie lent to the  members. Those responsible for the proper conduct of co-operative  societies will see to it that the money advanced does not find its way  into the toddy-seller's bill or into the pockets of the keepers of  gambling dens. I would excuse the rapacity of the Mahajan if it has  succeeded in keeping the gambling die or toddy from the ryot's home.    A word perhaps about the Mahajan will not be out of place. Co-operation  is not a new device. The ryots co-operate to drum out monkeys or birds  that destroy their crops. They co-operate to use a common thrashing  floor. I have found them co-operate to protect their cattle to the  extent of their devoting the best land for the grazing of their cattle.  And they have been found co-operating against a particular rapacious  Mahajan. Doubts have been expressed as to the success of co-operation  because of the tightness of the Mahajan's hold on the ryots. I do not  share the fears. The mightiest Mahajan must, if he represent an evil  force, bend before co-operation, conceived as an essentially moral  movement. But my limited experience of the Mahajan of Champaran has made  me revise the accepted opinion about his 'blighting influence.' I have  found him to be not always relentless, not always exacting of the last  pie. He sometimes serves his clients in many ways and even comes to  their rescue in the hour of their distress. My observation is so limited  that I dare not draw any conclusions from it, but I respectfully enquire  whether it is not possible to make a serious effort to draw out the good  in the Mahajan and help him or induce him to throw out the evil in him.  May he not be induced to join the army of co-operation, or has  experience proved that he is past praying for?    I note that the movement takes note of all indigenous industries. I beg  publicly to express my gratitude to Government for helping me in my  humble effort to improve the lot of the weaver. The experiment I am  conducting shows that there is a vast field for work in this direction.  No well-wisher of India, no patriot dare look upon the impending  destruction of the hand-loom weaver with equanimity. As Dr. Mann has  stated, this industry used to supply the peasant with an additional  source of livelihood and an insurance against famine. Every registrar  who will nurse back to life this important and graceful industry will  earn the gratitude of India. My humble effort consists firstly in making  researches as to the possibilities of simple reforms in the orthodox  hand-looms, secondly, in weaning the educated youth from the craving for  Government or other services and the feeling that education renders him  unfit for independent occupation and inducing him to take to weaving as  a calling as honourable as that of a barrister or a doctor, and thirdly  by helping those weavers who have abandoned their occupation to revert  to it. I will not weary the audience with any statement on the first two  parts of the experiment. The third may be allowed a few sentences as it  has a direct bearing upon the subject before us. I was able to enter  upon it only six months ago. Five families that had left off the calling  have reverted to it and they are doing a prosperous business. The Ashram  supplies them at their door with the yarn they need; its volunteers  take delivery of the cloth woven, paying them cash at the market rate.  The Ashram merely loses interest on the loan advanced for the yarn. It  has as yet suffered no loss and is able to restrict its loss to a  minimum by limiting the loan to a particular figure. All future  transactions are strictly cash. We are able to command a ready sale for  the cloth received. The loss of interest, therefore, on the transaction  is negligible. I would like the audience to note its purely moral  character from start to finish. The Ashram depends for its existence on  such help as _friends_ render it. We, therefore, can have no warrant for  charging interest. The weavers could not be saddled with it. Whole  families that were breaking to pieces are put together again. The use of  the loan is pre-determined. And we, the middlemen, being volunteers,  obtain the privilege of entering into the lives of these families, I  hope, for their and our betterment. We cannot lift them without being  lifted ourselves. This last relationship has not yet been developed, but  we hope, at an early date, to take in hand the education too of these  families and not rest satisfied till we have touched them at every  point. This is not too ambitious a dream. God willing, it will be a  reality some day. I have ventured to dilate upon the small experiment to  illustrate what I mean by co-operation to present it to others for  imitation. Let us be sure of our ideal. We shall ever fail to realise  it, but we should never cease to strive for it. Then there need be no  fear of \"co-operation of scoundrels\" that Ruskin so rightly dreaded.
