Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary     includes an entry which implies that the plural of `mouse' is     [101]meeces, and notes that the defined plural of `caboose' is     `cabeese'. This latter has apparently been standard (or at least a     standard joke) among railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many years.       On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in `x' may     form plurals in `-xen' (see [102]VAXen and [103]boxen in the main     text). Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated     this way; e.g., `soxen' for a bunch of socks. Other funny plurals are     `frobbotzim' for the plural of `frobbozz' (see [104]frobnitz) and     `Unices' and `Twenices' (rather than `Unixes' and `Twenexes'; see     [105]Unix, [106]TWENEX in main text). But note that `Twenexen' was     never used, and `Unixen' was not sighted in the wild until the year     2000, thirty years after it might logically have come into use; it has     been suggested that this is because `-ix' and `-ex' are Latin singular     endings that attract a Latinate plural. Finally, it has been suggested     to general approval that the plural of `mongoose' ought to be     `polygoose'.       The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is     generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either an     import or a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending `-im', or the     Anglo-Saxon plural suffix `-en') to cases where it isn't normally     considered to apply.       This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well aware     of what they are doing when they distort the language. It is     grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness. It is done not to     impress but to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Spoken Inarticulations, Next:[107]Anthropomorphization,     Previous:[108]Overgeneralization, Up:[109]Jargon Construction      Spoken inarticulations       Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where     their referent might more naturally be used. It has been suggested     that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such     noises on a comm link or in electronic mail, MUDs, and IRC channels     (interestingly, the same sorts of constructions have been showing up     with increasing frequency in comic strips). Another expression     sometimes heard is \"Complain!\", meaning \"I have a complaint!\"       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Anthropomorphization, Next:[110]Comparatives,     Previous:[111]Spoken Inarticulations, Up:[112]Jargon Construction      Anthropomorphization       Semantically, one rich source of jargon constructions is the hackish     tendency to anthropomorphize hardware and software. English purists     and academic computer scientists frequently look down on others for     anthropomorphizing hardware and software, considering this sort of     behavior to be characteristic of naive misunderstanding. But most     hackers anthropomorphize freely, frequently describing program     behavior in terms of wants and desires.       Thus it is common to hear hardware or software talked about as though     it has homunculi talking to each other inside it, with intentions and     desires. Thus, one hears \"The protocol handler got confused\", or that     programs \"are trying\" to do things, or one may say of a routine that     \"its goal in life is to X\". One even hears explanations like \"... and     its poor little brain couldn't understand X, and it died.\" Sometimes     modelling things this way actually seems to make them easier to     understand, perhaps because it's instinctively natural to think of     anything with a really complex behavioral repertoire as `like a     person' rather than `like a thing'.       At first glance, to anyone who understands how these programs actually     work, this seems like an absurdity. As hackers are among the people     who know best how these phenomena work, it seems odd that they would     use language that seemds to ascribe conciousness to them. The mind-set     behind this tendency thus demands examination.       The key to understanding this kind of usage is that it isn't done in a     naive way; hackers don't personalize their stuff in the sense of     feeling empathy with it, nor do they mystically believe that the     things they work on every day are `alive'. To the contrary: hackers     who anthropomorphize are expressing not a vitalistic view of program     behavior but a mechanistic view of human behavior.       Almost all hackers subscribe to the mechanistic, materialistic     ontology of science (this is in practice true even of most of the     minority with contrary religious theories). In this view, people are     biological machines - consciousness is an interesting and valuable     epiphenomenon, but mind is implemented in machinery which is not     fundamentally different in information-processing capacity from     computers.       Hackers tend to take this a step further and argue that the difference     between a substrate of CHON atoms and water and a substrate of silicon     and metal is a relatively unimportant one; what matters, what makes a     thing `alive', is information and richness of pattern. This is animism     from the flip side; it implies that humans and computers and dolphins     and rocks are all machines exhibiting a continuum of modes of     `consciousness' according to their information-processing capacity.       Because hackers accept a that a human machine can have intentions, it     is therefore easy for them to ascribe consciousness and intention to     complex patterned systems such as computers. If consciousness is     mechanical, it is neither more or less absurd to say that \"The program     wants to go into an infinite loop\" than it is to say that \"I want to     go eat some chocolate\" - and even defensible to say that \"The stone,     once dropped, wants to move towards the center of the earth\".       This viewpoint has respectable company in academic philosophy. Daniel     Dennett organizes explanations of behavior using three stances: the     \"physical stance\" (thing-to-be-explained as a physical object), the     \"design stance\" (thing-to-be-explained as an artifact), and the     \"intentional stance\" (thing-to-be-explained as an agent with desires     and intentions). Which stances are appropriate is a matter not of     truth but of utility. Hackers typically view simple programs from the     design stance, but more complex ones are modelled using the     intentional stance.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Comparatives, Previous:[113]Anthropomorphization, Up:[114]Jargon     Construction      Comparatives       Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood     as members of sets of comparatives. This is especially true of the     adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional     quality of code. Here is an approximately correct spectrum:         monstrosity brain-damage screw bug lose misfeature       crock kluge hack win feature elegance perfection       The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never     actually attained. Another similar scale is used for describing the     reliability of software:         broken flaky dodgy fragile brittle       solid robust bulletproof armor-plated       Note, however, that `dodgy' is primarily Commonwealth Hackish (it is     rare in the U.S.) and may change places with `flaky' for some     speakers.       Coinages for describing [115]lossage seem to call forth the very     finest in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said     that hackers have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish     has for obnoxious people.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Hacker Writing Style, Next:[116]Email Quotes,     Previous:[117]Jargon Construction, Up:[118]Top    Hacker Writing Style       We've already seen that hackers often coin jargon by overgeneralizing     grammatical rules. This is one aspect of a more general fondness for     form-versus-content language jokes that shows up particularly in     hackish writing. One correspondent reports that he consistently     misspells `wrong' as `worng'. Others have been known to criticize     glitches in Jargon File drafts by observing (in the mode of Douglas     Hofstadter) \"This sentence no verb\", or \"Too repetetetive\", or \"Bad     speling\", or \"Incorrectspa cing.\" Similarly, intentional spoonerisms     are often made of phrases relating to confusion or things that are     confusing; `dain bramage' for `brain damage' is perhaps the most     common (similarly, a hacker would be likely to write \"Excuse me, I'm     cixelsyd today\", rather than \"I'm dyslexic today\"). This sort of thing     is quite common and is enjoyed by all concerned.       Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses,     much to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if \"Jim is going\" is a     phrase, and so are \"Bill runs\" and \"Spock groks\", then hackers     generally prefer to write: \"Jim is going\", \"Bill runs\", and \"Spock     groks\". This is incorrect according to standard American usage (which     would put the continuation commas and the final period inside the     string quotes); however, it is counter-intuitive to hackers to     mutilate literal strings with characters that don't belong in them.     Given the sorts of examples that can come up in discussions of     programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly misleading.     When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra     characters can be a real pain in the neck.       Consider, for example, a sentence in a [119]vi tutorial "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30103"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#5)"],[1,"after the Bluebird, comes the Robin, sometimes in March,  but in most of the northern states April is the month of his arrival.  With his first utterance the spell of winter is broken, and the  remembrance of it afar off. Then appears the Woodpecker in great  variety, the Flicker usually arriving first. He is always somebody's old  favorite, \"announcing his arrival by a long, loud call, repeated from  the dry branch of some tree, or a stake in the fence--a thoroughly  melodious April sound.\"    Few perhaps reflect upon the difficulties encountered by the birds  themselves in their returning migrations. A voyager sometimes meets  with many of our common birds far out at sea. Such wanderers, it is  said, when suddenly overtaken by a fog, completely lose their sense of  direction and become hopelessly lost. Humming birds, those delicately  organized, glittering gems, are among the most common of the land  species seen at sea.    The present season has been quite favorable to the protection of birds.  A very competent observer says that not all of the birds migrated this  winter. He recently visited a farm less than an hour's ride from  Chicago, where he found the old place, as he relates it, \"chucked full  of Robins, Blackbirds, and Woodpeckers,\" and others unknown to him.  From this he inferred they would have been in Florida had indications  predicted a severe winter. The trees of the south parks of Chicago,  and those in suburban places, have had, darting through their branches  during the months of December and January, nearly as many members of the  Woodpecker tribe as were found there during the mating season in May  last.    Alas, that the Robin will visit us in diminished numbers in the  approaching spring. He has not been so common for a year or two as  he was formerly, for the reason that the Robins died by thousands of  starvation, owing to the freezing of their food supply in Tennessee  during the protracted cold weather in the winter of 1895. It is indeed  sad that this good Samaritan among birds should be defenseless against  the severity of Nature, the common mother of us all. Nevertheless the  return of the birds, in myriads or in single pairs, will be welcomed  more and more, year by year, as intelligent love and appreciation of  them shall possess the popular mind.           [Illustration: BLACK TERN.   Mother and Young with Eggs.]    THE BLACK TERN.      \"The Tern,\" says Mr. F. M. Woodruff, of the Chicago Academy of Sciences,  \"is the only representative of the long-winged swimmers which commonly  nests with us on our inland fresh water marshes, arriving early in May  in its brooding plumage of sooty black. The color changes in the autumn  to white, and a number of the adult birds may be found, in the latter  part of July, dotted and streaked here and there with white. On the  first of June, 1891, I found a large colony of Black Terns nesting on  Hyde Lake, Cook County, Illinois. As I approached the marsh a few birds  were seen flying high in the air, and, as I neared the nesting site, the  flying birds gave notes of alarm, and presently the air was filled with  the graceful forms of this beautiful little bird. They circled about me,  darting down to within a few feet of my head, constantly uttering a  harsh, screaming cry. As the eggs are laid upon the bare ground, which  the brownish and blackish markings so closely resemble, I was at first  unable to find the nests, and discovered that the only way to locate  them was to stand quietly and watch the birds. When the Tern is passing  over the nest it checks its flight, and poises for a moment on quivering  wings. By keeping my eyes on this spot I found the nest with very little  trouble. The complement of eggs, when the bird has not been disturbed,  is usually three. These are laid in a saucer shaped structure of dead  vegetation, which is scraped together, from the surface of the wet,  boggy ground. The bird figured in the plate had placed its nest on the  edge of an old muskrat house, and my attention was attracted to it by  the fact that upon the edge of the rat house, where it had climbed to  rest itself, was the body of a young dabchick, or piedbilled grebe,  scarcely two and one-half inches long, and not twenty-four hours out of  the egg, a beautiful little ball of blackish down, striped with brown  and white. From the latter part of July to the middle of August large  flocks of Black Terns may be seen on the shores of our larger lakes on  their annual migration southward.\"    The Rev. P. B. Peabody, in alluding to his observation of the nests  of the Tern, says: \"Amid this floating sea of aquatic nests I saw an  unusual number of well constructed homes of the Tern. Among these was  one that I count a perfect nest. It rested on the perfectly flat  foundation of a small decayed rat house, which was about fourteen  inches in diameter. The nest, in form, is a truncated cone (barring  the cavity), was about eight inches high and ten inches in diameter.  The hollow--quite shallow--was about seven inches across, being thus  unusually large. The whole was built up of bits of rushes, carried to  the spot, these being quite uniform in length--about four inches.\" After  daily observation of the Tern, during which time he added much to his  knowledge of the bird, he pertinently asks: \"Who shall say how many  traits and habits yet unknown may be discovered through patient watching  of community-breeding birds, by men enjoying more of leisure for such  delightful studies than often falls to the lot of most of us who have  bread and butter to earn and a tiny part of the world's work to  finish?\"          THE MEADOW LARK.              \"Not an inch of his body is free from delight.      Can he keep himself still if he would? Oh, not he!          The music stirs in him like wind through a tree.\"    The well known Meadow or Old Field Lark is a constant resident south  of latitude 39, and many winter farther north in favorite localities.  Its geographical range is eastern North America, Canada to south Nova  Scotia, Quebec, and Ontario to eastern Manitoba; west to Minnesota,  Iowa, Missouri, eastern Kansas, the Indian Territory, and Texas; south  to Florida and the Gulf coast, in all of which localities, except in the  extreme north, it usually rears two or three broods in a season. In the  Northern States it is only a summer resident, arriving in April and  remaining until the latter part of October and occasionally November.  Excepting during the breeding season, small flocks may often be seen  roving about in search of good feeding grounds. Major Bendire says  this is especially true in the fall of the year. At this time several  families unite, and as many as two dozen may occasionally be flushed in  a field, over which they scatter, roaming about independently of each  other. When one takes wing all the others in the vicinity follow. It  is a shy bird in the East, while in the middle states it is quite the  reverse. Its flight is rather laborious, at least in starting, and is  continued by a series of rapid movements of the wings, alternating with  short distances of sailing, and is rarely protracted. On alighting,  which is accompanied with a twitching of its tail, it usually settles on  some fence rail, post, boulder, weedstock, or on a hillock in a meadow  from which it can get a good view of the surroundings, and but rarely  on a limb of a tree. Its favorite resorts are meadows, fallow fields,  pastures, and clearings, but in some sections, as in northern Florida,  for instance, it also frequents the low, open pine woods and nests  there.    The song of the Meadow Lark is not much varied, but its clear, whistling  notes, so frequently heard in the early spring, are melodious and  pleasing to the ear. It is decidedly the farmers' friend, feeding, as  it does, on noxious insects, caterpillars, moths, grasshoppers, spiders,  worms and the like, and eating but little grain. The lark spends the  greater part of its time on the ground, procuring all its food there.  It is seldom found alone, and it is said remains paired for life.    Nesting begins in the early part of May and lasts through June. Both  sexes assist in building the nest, which is always placed on the ground,  either in a natural depression, or in a little hollow scratched out by  the birds, alongside a bunch of grass or weeds. The nest itself is lined  with dry grass, stubble, and sometimes pine needles. Most nests are  placed in level meadows. The eggs and young are frequently destroyed by  vermin, for the meadow lark has many enemies. The eggs vary from three  to seven, five being the most common, and both sexes assist in the  hatching, which requires about fifteen or sixteen days. The young leave  the nest before they are able to fly--hiding at the slightest sign of  danger. The Meadow Lark does not migrate beyond the United States. It is  a native bird, and is only accidental in England. The eggs are spotted,  blotched, and speckled with shades of brown, purple and lavender. A  curious incident is told of a Meadow Lark trying to alight on the top  mast of a schooner several miles at sea. It was evidently very tired but  would not venture near the deck.          [Illustration: MEADOW LARK.]    THE MEADOW LARK.      I told the man who wanted my picture that he could take it if he would  show my nest and eggs. Do you blame me for saying so? Don't you think it  makes a better picture than if I stood alone?    Mr. Lark is away getting me some breakfast, or he could be in the  picture, too. After a few days I shall have some little baby birds, and  then won't we be happy.    Boys and girls who live in the country know us pretty well. When they  drive the cows out to pasture, or when they go out to gather wild  flowers, we sit on the fences by the roadside and make them glad with  our merry song.    Those of you who live in the city cannot see us unless you come out into  the country.  "]]]
