OEdipus paid no attention to this news; for he little suspected that  the old man whom he had killed was the king, whom everybody loved, and  for whom they now mourned with noisy grief.    He was, however, deeply interested in the story of the Sphinx; and he  was so sure that he could guess the riddle, that he immediately set out  to find the monster. He walked boldly along the road until stopped by  the Sphinx, which told him to answer this riddle if he wished to live:  \"What creature walks upon four feet in the morning, upon two at noon,  and upon three at night?\"    After a few moments' deep thought, OEdipus answered that the creature  was _man_. \"For,\" said he, \"in the morning of life, or in babyhood, man  creeps on hands and knees; at noon, or in manhood, he walks erect; and  at evening, or in old age, he supports his tottering steps with a  staff.\"    The Sphinx's riddle was guessed; and the monster, knowing that its power  was now at an end, tried to get away. But OEdipus would not allow it  to do so; and, drawing his sword, he forced it back until it fell over a  precipice, on the sharp stones below, and was dashed to pieces.          X. BLINDNESS AND DEATH OF OEDIPUS.      Boeotia was now rid of the Sphinx; and when the The'bans heard the  joyful news of its death, they welcomed OEdipus with much joy. In  reward for his bravery, they gave him not only the throne, but also the  hand of Jocasta, the widowed queen. It was thus that OEdipus, although  he did not know it, fulfilled the second part of the prophecy, and  married his own mother.    Several years now passed by, during which OEdipus ruled the Thebans so  wisely, that they all loved him dearly, and went to him for advice in  all their troubles. Finally the good times came to an end; and the  people were again terrified, because a plague, or great sickness, broke  out in the city, and many of the inhabitants died.    All kinds of medicines were tried, but without effect; and all the gods  were asked to lend their aid. In despair, OEdipus sent a messenger to  Delphi to ask the oracle how the disease could be stopped. The oracle  for once gave a plain answer, and said that the plague would cease only  when the murderer of Laius had been found and punished.    Investigations were now made for the first time, and it was found that  OEdipus was the one who had slain the king. At the same time, the  servant confessed that he had not killed the royal child; and the  shepherd told how he had found the babe and carried him to Corinth,  where he had been adopted by the king.    When OEdipus heard all this, he was driven almost mad with despair;  for now he knew not only that he had murdered his father and married his  mother, but that it was on his account that the plague had caused the  death of so many people in Thebes.    In her horror and grief at this discovery, Queen Jocasta killed herself.  When OEdipus learned that she was dead, he ran into the room where she  lay, and took one of the buckles which fastened her dress and put out  his eyes with it, saying, that, since they had beheld such a sorrowful  sight, they should never again see the light of day.    To rid the city of his accursed presence, and thus, if possible, save it  from the threatened destruction, OEdipus banished himself, and  wandered away, old, blind, and poor, for he would take none of his  riches with him.    He departed sorrowfully, leaving his kingdom to his two sons,  E-te'o-cles and Pol-y-ni'ces, and telling them to care for their  sisters, An-tig'o-ne and Is-me'ne.    Ismene wept bitterly when she said good-by to her father; but Antigone  placed her father's hand upon her shoulder, said that she would never  forsake him, and left the city, tenderly supporting and guiding him.    Father and daughter wandered thus from place to place, finding no rest;  for all the people shrank from even looking upon OEdipus, who, they  said, was evidently accursed by the gods, since he had committed such  frightful crimes.    After many days' wandering and much fatigue, the exiles arrived at last  on the border of a dark forest held sacred to the Furies,--the goddesses  whose duty it was to punish all criminals by tormenting them as long as  they lived, and even after they had died.    When Antigone described to her poor blind father the place they had  reached, he bade her remain by the roadside, and, groping his way, soon  vanished into the forest. He had scarcely gone, when a terrible  thunderstorm arose. The air grew dark, the lightning flashed, the  thunder rolled, the trees bent and twisted in the wind; and, although  Antigone called her father again and again, she heard no answering cry.    When morning came, she went to look for him, but found no trace of him.  The people in the neighborhood then told her that the Furies had dragged  her father away to punish him for his crimes, and Antigone sadly went  back to Thebes.    As soon as she arrived in the city, Antigone hastened to the palace to  tell her brothers and sister about their father's sad death; but when  she entered her former happy home, she learned that there are sadder  things than death, for her brothers were no longer friends, and had  begun a terrible quarrel.          XI. THE BROTHERS' QUARREL.      The misfortunes of Thebes had not come to an end with the banishment of  OEdipus, and fate was still against the unhappy city. The plague, it  is true, had stopped; but the two young princes were quarreling about  the possession of the throne.    Both wanted to reign, and neither wished to share the throne with his  brother. After much dispute, they agreed at last that each should reign  a year in turn.    Eteocles, the elder, was of course allowed to rule during the first  year; while Polynices went to pay a visit to A-dras'tus, King of Argos.  Here he was warmly welcomed and hospitably entertained; but when the  year was ended, he hurried back to Thebes to reign in his turn.    When he came to the city, however, Eteocles refused to give up the  scepter, and, calling out his guards, made use of his power to drive  Polynices out of the town. This was very wrong, for a promise should  always be kept; and it made Polynices so angry, that he said he would  return with an army, and force his brother to act fairly.    Polynices therefore hurried back to Argos, and soon persuaded Adrastus,  with five other kings and noted warriors, to go with him to Thebes, and  help him take the throne by force.    When Eteocles heard that seven kings were coming with a large army to  make him give up the throne of Thebes, he made up his mind to fight hard  to keep it. After strengthening the city walls, laying in a great stock  of provisions, and securing the help of seven brave allies, Eteocles  closed the gates of Thebes, and calmly awaited the arrival of the enemy.    Meanwhile the seven chiefs were marching from Argos to Thebes. They came  at last to the forest of Ne'me-a, where Hercules, the chief hero of  Argos, had once slain a terrible lion. This monster had long lived in  the forest, filling the hearts of all the people with dread; and when  Hercules came out of the forest, wearing the skin of the lion, they had  greatly rejoiced.    [Illustration: Hercules and the Nemean Lion.]    In honor of Hercules' victory over the Ne'me-an lion, the seven chiefs  stopped in this spot to celebrate games, which they said should be held  in that neighborhood every three years. This festival was ever after  celebrated thus; and when the people gathered together there to see the  racing and boxing, they loved to recall the memory of the brave lion  slayer, and of the seven kings who had first celebrated the Nemean  games.    When Polynices and his allies came at last to Thebes, they found all the  gates closed; and although they fought bravely, and tried hard to enter  the city, they were kept at bay for seven long years. At the end of that  time the people inside the city, and those without, were equally tired  of this long siege: so it was finally agreed that the two armies should  meet on a neighboring plain and fight it out.    The armies were led by the two brothers, who now hated each other so  bitterly, that, instead of waiting for the signal for battle, they  rushed upon each other, and both fell before any one could interfere.    This terrible end of their quarrel filled the hearts of both armies with  fear, and they agreed to make a truce in order to bury their chiefs. As  it was customary at that time to burn the bodies of the dead, both  corpses were laid upon the funeral pyre side by side. When the wood was  all burned, the ashes were put into separate urns, for the Greeks used  to tell their children that these brothers hated each other so much that  even their ashes would not mingle.    This story of OEdipus and his family is only a myth, but it is a very  celebrated one. The Greeks wrote stories, poems, and plays about it, and  it is on that account that it should be known by every one who wishes to  study the history of Greece.          XII. THE TAKING OF THEBES.      The terrible death of the two brothers Eteocles and Polynices did not,  as you might suppose, end the siege of Thebes. No sooner were their  funerals over, than both armies began to fight again; and they continued  the contest until all the chiefs had been killed except Adrastus only.    Most of the soldiers had also been slain: so Adrastus made up his mind  to go home, and wait until the sons of these fallen heroes were old  enough to fight, before he went on with the war. As they thought it  their duty to avenge all injuries, and especially the death of a  relative, Adrastus had no trouble in getting these youths to march  against Thebes. So they began a second siege, which was known as the War  of the E-pig'o-ni, or descendants, because the young warriors took up  their fathers'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#5)"],[1,".  They and their contiguous  swamps are the great habitat of the alligator and the fresh-water  shark--the gar.  Numerous species of water and wading fowl fly over  them, and plunge through their dark tide.  Here you may see the red  flamingo, the egret, the trumpeter-swan, the blue heron, the wild goose,  the crane, the snake-bird, the pelican, and the ibis; you may likewise  see the osprey, and the white-headed eagle robbing him of his prey.  Both swamps and bayous produce abundantly fish, reptile, and insect, and  are, consequently, the favourite resort of hundreds of birds which prey  upon these creatures.  In some places, their waters form a complete  net-work over the country, which you may traverse with a small boat in  almost any direction; indeed, this is the means by which many  settlements communicate with each other.  As you approach southward  towards the Gulf, you get clear of the timber; and within some fifty  miles of the sea, there is not a tree to be seen.    \"In the first day or two that I was out, I had succeeded in getting all  the specimens I wanted, with the exception of the ibis.  This shy  creature avoided me; in fact I had only seen one or two in my  excursions, and these at a great distance.  I still, however, had hopes  of finding them before my return to my friend.    \"About the third or fourth day I set out from a small settlement on the  edge of one of the larger bayous.  I had no other company than my gun.  I was even unattended by a dog, as my favourite spaniel had the day  before been bitten by an alligator while swimming across the bayou, and  I was compelled to leave him at the settlement.  Of course the object of  my excursion was a search after new flora, but I had become by this time  very desirous of getting the rare ibis, and I was determined half to  neglect my botanising for that purpose.  I went of course in a boat, a  light skiff, such as is commonly used by the inhabitants of these parts.    \"Occasionally using the paddles, I allowed myself to float some four or  live miles down the main bayou; but as the birds I was in search of did  not appear, I struck into a `branch,' and sculled myself up-stream.  This carried me through a solitary region, with marshes stretching as  far as the eye could see, covered with tall reeds.  There was no  habitation, nor aught that betokened the presence of man.  It was just  possible that I was the first human being who had ever found a motive  for propelling a boat through the dark waters of this solitary stream.    \"As I advanced, I fell in with game; and I succeeded in bagging several,  both of the great wood-ibis and the white species.  I also shot a fine  white-headed eagle (_Falco leucocephalus_), which came soaring over my  boat, unconscious of danger.  But the bird which I most wanted seemed  that which could not be obtained.  I wanted the scarlet ibis.    \"I think I had rowed some three miles up-stream, and was about to take  in my oars and leave my boat to float back again, when I perceived that,  a little farther up, the bayou widened.  Curiosity prompted me to  continue; and after pulling a few hundred strokes, I found myself at the  end of an oblong lake, a mile or so in length.  It was deep, dark,  marshy around the shores, and full of alligators.  I saw their ugly  forms and long serrated backs, as they floated about in all parts of it,  hungrily hunting for fish and eating one another; but all this was  nothing new, for I had witnessed similar scenes during the whole of my  excursion.  What drew my attention most, was a small islet near the  middle of the lake, upon one end of which stood a row of upright forms  of a bright scarlet colour.  These red creatures were the very objects I  was in search of.  They might be flamingoes: I could not tell at that  distance.  So much the better, if I could only succeed in getting a shot  at them; but these creatures are even more wary than the ibis; and as  the islet was low, and altogether without cover, it was not likely they  would allow me to come within range: nevertheless, I was determined to  make the attempt.  I rowed up the lake, occasionally turning my head to  see if the game had taken the alarm.  The sun was hot and dazzling; and  as the bright scarlet was magnified by refraction, I fancied for a long  time they were flamingoes.  This fancy was dissipated as I drew near.  The outlines of the bills, like the blade of a sabre, convinced me they  were the ibis; besides, I now saw that they were less than three feet in  height, while the flamingoes stand five.  There were a dozen of them in  all.  These were balancing themselves, as is their usual habit, on one  leg, apparently asleep, or _buried in deep thought_.  They were on the  upper extremity of the islet, while I was approaching it from below.  It  was not above sixty yards across; and could I only reach the point  nearest me, I knew my gun would throw shot to kill at that distance.  I  feared the stroke of the sculls would start them, and I pulled slowly  and cautiously.  Perhaps the great heat--for it was as hot a day as I  can remember--had rendered them torpid or lazy.  Whether or not, they  sat still until the cut-water of my skiff touched the bank of the islet.  I drew my gun up cautiously, took aim, and fired both barrels almost  simultaneously.  When the smoke cleared out of my eyes, I saw that all  the birds had flown off except one, that lay stretched out by the edge  of the water.    \"Gun in hand, I leaped out of the boat, and ran across the islet to bag  my game.  This occupied but a few minutes; and I was turning to go back  to the skiff, when, to my consternation, I saw it out upon the lake, and  rapidly floating downward!    \"In my haste I had left it unfastened, and the bayou current had carried  it off.  It was still but a hundred yards distant, but it might as well  have been a hundred miles, for at that time I could not swim a stroke.    \"My first impulse was to rush down to the lake, and after the boat.  This impulse was checked on arriving at the water's edge, which I saw at  a glance was fathoms in depth.  Quick reflection told me that the boat  was gone--irrecoverably gone!    \"I did not at first comprehend the full peril of my situation; nor will  you, gentlemen.  I was on an islet, in a lake, only half a mile from its  shores--alone, it is true, and without a boat; but what of that?  Many a  man had been so before, with not an idea of danger.    \"These were first thoughts, natural enough; but they rapidly gave place  to others of a far different character.  When I gazed after my boat, now  beyond recovery--when I looked around, and saw that the lake lay in the  middle of an interminable swamp, the shores of which, even could I have  reached them, did not seem to promise me footing--when I reflected that,  being unable to swim, I could _not_ reach them--that upon the islet  there was neither tree, nor log, nor bush; not a stick out of which I  might make a raft--I say, when I reflected upon all these things, there  arose in my mind a feeling of well-defined and absolute horror.    \"It is true I was only in a lake, a mile or so in width; but so far as  the peril and helplessness of my situation were concerned, I might as  well have been upon a rock in the middle of the Atlantic.  I knew that  there was no settlement within miles--miles of pathless swamp.  I knew  that no one could either see or hear me--no one was at all likely to  come near the lake; indeed, I felt satisfied that my faithless boat was  the first keel that had ever cut its waters.  The very tameness of the  birds wheeling round my head was evidence of this.  I felt satisfied,  too, that without some one to help me, I should never go out from that  lake: I must die on the islet, or drown in attempting to leave it!    \"These reflections rolled rapidly over my startled soul.  The facts were  clear, the hypothesis definite, the sequence certain; there was no  ambiguity, no supposititious hinge upon which I could hang a hope; no,  not one.  I could not even expect that I should be missed and sought  for; there was no one to search for me.  The simple _habitans_ of the  village I had left knew me not--I was a stranger among them: they only  knew me as a stranger, and fancied me a strange individual; one who made  lonely excursions, and brought home hunches of weeds, with birds,  insects, and reptiles, which they had never before seen, although  gathered at their own doors.  My absence, besides, would be nothing new  to them, even though it lasted for days: I had often been absent before,  a week at a time.  There was no hope of my being missed.    \"I have said that these reflections came and passed quickly.  In less  than a minute, my affrighted soul was in full possession of them, and  almost yielded itself to despair.  I shouted, but rather involuntarily  than with any hope that I should be heard; I shouted loudly and  fiercely: my answer--the echoes of my own voice, the shriek of the  osprey, and the maniac laugh of the white-headed eagle.    \"I ceased to shout, threw my gun to the earth, and tottered down beside  it.  I can imagine the feelings of a man shut up in a gloomy prison--  they are not pleasant.  I have been lost upon the wild prairie--the land  sea--without bush, break, or star to guide me--that was worse.  There  you look around; you see nothing; you hear nothing: you are alone with  God, and you tremble in his presence; your senses swim; your brain  reels; you are afraid of yourself; you are afraid of your own mind.  Deserted by everything else, you dread lest it, too, may forsake you.  There is horror in this--it is very horrible--it is hard to bear; but I  have borne it all, and would bear it again twenty times over rather than  endure once more the first hour I spent on that lonely islet in that  lonely lake.  Your prison may be dark and silent, but you feel that you  are not utterly alone; beings like"]]]
