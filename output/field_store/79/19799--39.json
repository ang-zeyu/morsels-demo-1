It may be noted that when this statement reached the ears of the  King of Holland, he emphatically repudiated it. He addressed the  British Government, saying \"that the disloyal communication of the  emigrant farmers had been repelled with indignation, and that the  King of Holland had taken every possible step to mark his  disapproval of the unjustifiable use made of his name by the  individuals referred to.\" Captain Smith, who fortunately had not  been imposed upon by what the Boers considered their neat ruse, made  preparations to attack them. But he overestimated his own or  underrated his adversary's strength. He fell into ambush and lost  heavily. He was then driven to entrench himself in Durban. One of  his men managed to escape, however, and by riding to Grahamstown  through dangerous country, contrived to convey the intelligence of  Captain Smith's misfortune, and to bring reinforcements to his aid.  These reinforcements arrived in Durban harbour on the 25th of June  1842. At sight of the British frigate and the goodly display of  redcoats, the Boers, who had been besieging Captain Smith for a  month with three guns and six hundred men, made good their escape,  leaving Pretorius no alternative but to make terms. Thus Natal  became a British possession.    In 1844 the place was declared to be a dependency of Cape Colony.  Many of the emigrants admitted themselves to be British subjects and  remained there, but the great majority took to their waggons and  lumbered back across the Drakenberg to their old settling-place.    There the original Voortrekkers had scattered themselves on both  sides of the Vaal River, and helped to found the Transvaal and the  Orange Free State. As may be imagined at this juncture, the natural  hostility to the British, which has now become part of the Boer  character, was growing apace. The voluntary exiles from Natal, on  moving to the north of the Orange River, determined to evade the  British, and proclaim the whole of that locality an independent  Republic. The authorities at the Cape, however, frustrated the new  struggle for independence. They laid claim for Great Britain to the  whole territory east of E. long. 22 deg. and south of S. lat. 25 deg., with  the exception of the land already owned by Portugal or by friendly  native chiefs.    [Illustration: CAPE TOWN, DEVIL'S PEAK, TABLE MOUNTAIN, AND LION'S  HEAD FROM TABLE BAY.    Photo by Wilson, Aberdeen]    It may be remembered that one of the causes of the great Trek was  the restoration of their province to Kaffirs, thereby according  to the blacks an independence that was not enjoyed by the Boers.  No astonishment, therefore, will be felt at the exasperation of the  Boers when they found that the Cape Government had entered into  treaties with the Griquas--treaties which seemed to them to promise  more freedom to the savage than was accorded to themselves.  Grievances of many kinds--some real and some ridiculous--continued  daily to occur. Things serious and things trivial were liable to  cause them equal indignation. According to Livingstone, the ignorant  followers of Potgieter--who were posted at Magaliesberg, a thousand  miles from the Cape--were moved to wrath merely by the arrival of  Herschel's great telescope at the Cape Observatory! What right, said  they, had the Government to erect that huge instrument at the Cape  for the purpose of seeing what they were doing behind the Kashan  mountains?    But of just grievances they had several, and these Pretorius, as  spokesman of his people, wished to lay before the Governor at the  Cape. Sir Henry Pottinger, who occupied that post in 1847,  unfortunately declined the interview; consequently affairs went from  bad to worse. In the end of the year Sir Henry Smith arrived as  Governor of the colony, and great things were expected of him. He  knew the native races, he knew the Boers, and they both knew him.  Pretorius, who was arranging a final emigration from Natal, was  summoned to confer with the new Governor. Sir Henry wished to gauge  the feelings of the farmers prior to issuing a proclamation (dated  February 3, 1848), declaring the Queen's sovereignty over the whole  country between the Orange and Vaal Rivers to eastward of the  Quathlamba Mountains. According to Pretorius, the conference was an  unsatisfactory one. He assured the Governor that his people would  never consent to it. Sir Henry Smith nevertheless considered himself  justified in taking the step, and the Home Government, whose policy  it had been to consolidate the peaceful native States along the  border, eventually coincided with his view.    No sooner was the proclamation generally known than the horde of  Pretorius' followers flew to arms. They swept southward, driving  every British official beyond the Orange River. Major Warden, the  Resident at Bloemfontein, where a British fort and garrison had been  placed some two years before, was forced to capitulate.    Sir Harry Smith, on becoming acquainted with the news, at once  offered a thousand pounds for the arrest of Pretorius. He also began  a march to the front. The Governor thought that he had but to come,  see, and conquer; but he was mistaken. He had tough work before him.  The Boers, about a thousand strong, had entrenched themselves in a  formidable position. They were superior in point of numbers, horses,  and guns to Sir Harry's forces; but he pursued his way, nothing  daunted. He stormed the position, and, after a hard fight, scattered  the enemy. They fled from Boomplaats, where the engagement had taken  place, and hastened back across the Vaal to their native haunts. The  date of the battle was the 29th of August 1848, and the father of  President Kruger is said to have been the first man to fire a shot  at the British on that occasion!    After this period various dissensions arose in the Boer camp between  Pretorius, who styled himself \"Chief of the whole united emigrant  force,\" and Potgieter, who looked upon himself somewhat in the light  of a rival. While these worthies fell out Sir Harry Smith saw the  annexation carried through, and the territory of the modern Free  State was united to Cape Colony, under the title of the Orange River  Sovereignty. The contumacious Boers took themselves off with their  leader across the Vaal, and fresh European settlers came in and  established themselves in the fertile plains that were deserted. For  some time after this things prospered, and Sir Harry saw before him  the prospect of a new self-governing Dutch colony, which would  resemble and equal those of Natal and the Cape. But he reckoned  without his host, and all that he had taken the trouble to do was  ultimately undone. In 1852 the Government at home declared its  policy to be the ultimate abandonment of the Orange River  Sovereignty. For this pusillanimous policy there were several  reasons, the greatest being a fear of a Basuto rising and the  trouble it would entail. The British Government therefore decided to  maintain its rights over the Transvaal no further, and by the Sand  River Convention, signed on the 17th of January 1852, the emigrant  farmers beyond the Vaal River were given the right to manage their  own affairs, subject only to the condition that they should neither  permit nor encourage slavery.    About this time commenced the threatened rise of the Basutos in the  neighbourhood of the Orange River territory. The Basutos are a  branch of the Bechuana race, who had been formed by their chiefs  Motlume and Moshesh into a powerful nation, which could hold its own  against Boer or Zulu. With this race the Home Government desired to  have nothing to do, and the Colonial Office, viewing the political  game as not worth the candle, definitely withdrew from the Orange  River Sovereignty, leaving the Free State to come into being, and  devise its own plans for overawing its enemies on the other side of  the border. Accordingly, in 1854, Sir Harry Smith's programme of  annexation was entirely wiped out, British sovereignty renounced,  and the Orange Free State left to become a Republic and take care of  itself!          CHAPTER I    THE GROWTH OF THE TRANSVAAL      Fifty years ago there was no Transvaal. To-day its area is rather  larger than Great Britain. It extends over some 75,000,000 acres.    Originally, at the time of the great Trek, a small portion of land  was seized from natives who fled before the pioneers, and settled in  what is now known as Matabeleland. Other Boers soon joined their  comrades, and, by applying the steady policy of \"grab and hold\" (a  policy that, unfortunately, has not been imitated by ourselves),  they gained strip on strip and acre on acre of land till the  Transvaal became the vast province it now is. It expanded first into  a portion of Zululand; later on, lapped over into Swaziland. By  degrees it encroached on the British boundaries, and most probably  would have gone on encroaching had not active steps been taken to  save the north from the invaders.    The original _Voertrekkers_, or pioneers, came in three detachments.  British-born subjects, but discontented with British civilisation,  they moved on from Natal, whence they were chased by the Union Jack,  and settled themselves first in land captured from King Umziligatze,  secondly in Lydenburg and Dekaap, and thirdly in the Zulu country.  The history of this Zululand expansion remains to be told. At  present it is interesting to follow the geographical growth of the  state which has become so troublesome, and whose self-assertion has  increased according to its size.    Originally each Boer was entitled to a farm with a minimum of 6000  acres of the \"Transvaal,\" and this custom of apportioning 6000-acre  farms lasted as long as the Kaffir lands lasted. The Boers, always  working on the principle that \"God helps those who help themselves,\"  helped themselves freely, sometimes with bloodshed and sometimes  without, until"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23731"],[0,"A Martian Odyssey (#5)"],[1,"a single vision, and Tweel saw what I  saw--or nothing. I couldn't ask him. But it's just another proof that  his intelligence is equal to ours or greater.\"    \"He's daffy, I tell you!\" said Harrison. \"What makes you think his  intellect ranks with the human?\"    \"Plenty of things! First, the pyramid-beast. He hadn't seen one before;  he said as much. Yet he recognized it as a dead-alive automaton of  silicon.\"    \"He could have heard of it,\" objected Harrison. \"He lives around here,  you know.\"    \"Well how about the language? I couldn't pick up a single idea of his  and he learned six or seven words of mine. And do you realize what  complex ideas he put over with no more than those six or seven words?  The pyramid-monster--the dream-beast! In a single phrase he told me that  one was a harmless automaton and the other a deadly hypnotist. What  about that?\"    \"Huh!\" said the captain.    \"_Huh_ if you wish! Could you have done it knowing only six words of  English? Could you go even further, as Tweel did, and tell me that  another creature was of a sort of intelligence so different from ours  that understanding was impossible--even more impossible than that  between Tweel and me?\"    \"Eh? What was that?\"    \"Later. The point I'm making is that Tweel and his race are worthy of  our friendship. Somewhere on Mars--and you'll find I'm right--is a  civilization and culture equal to ours, and maybe more than equal. And  communication is possible between them and us; Tweel proves that. It may  take years of patient trial, for their minds are alien, but less alien  than the next minds we encountered--if they _are_ minds.\"    \"The next ones? What next ones?\"    \"The people of the mud cities along the canals.\" Jarvis frowned, then  resumed his narrative. \"I thought the dream-beast and the  silicon-monster were the strangest beings conceivable, but I was wrong.  These creatures are still more alien, less understandable than either  and far less comprehensible than Tweel, with whom friendship is  possible, and even, by patience and concentration, the exchange of  ideas.    \"Well,\" he continued, \"we left the dream-beast dying, dragging itself  back into its hole, and we moved toward the canal. There was a carpet of  that queer walking-grass scampering out of our way, and when we reached  the bank, there was a yellow trickle of water flowing. The mound city  I'd noticed from the rocket was a mile or so to the right and I was  curious enough to want to take a look at it.    \"It had seemed deserted from my previous glimpse of it, and if any  creatures were lurking in it--well, Tweel and I were both armed. And by  the way, that crystal weapon of Tweel's was an interesting device; I  took a look at it after the dream-beast episode. It fired a little glass  splinter, poisoned, I suppose, and I guess it held at least a hundred of  'em to a load. The propellent was steam--just plain steam!\"    \"Shteam!\" echoed Putz. \"From vot come, shteam?\"    \"From water, of course! You could see the water through the transparent  handle and about a gill of another liquid, thick and yellowish. When  Tweel squeezed the handle--there was no trigger--a drop of water and a  drop of the yellow stuff squirted into the firing chamber, and the water  vaporized--pop!--like that. It's not so difficult; I think we could  develop the same principle. Concentrated sulphuric acid will heat water  almost to boiling, and so will quicklime, and there's potassium and  sodium--    \"Of course, his weapon hadn't the range of mine, but it wasn't so bad in  this thin air, and it _did_ hold as many shots as a cowboy's gun in a  Western movie. It was effective, too, at least against Martian life; I  tried it out, aiming at one of the crazy plants, and darned if the plant  didn't wither up and fall apart! That's why I think the glass splinters  were poisoned.    \"Anyway, we trudged along toward the mud-heap city and I began to wonder  whether the city builders dug the canals. I pointed to the city and then  at the canal, and Tweel said 'No--no--no!' and gestured toward the  south. I took it to mean that some other race had created the canal  system, perhaps Tweel's people. I don't know; maybe there's still  another intelligent race on the planet, or a dozen others. Mars is a  queer little world.    \"A hundred yards from the city we crossed a sort of road--just a  hard-packed mud trail, and then, all of a sudden, along came one of the  mound builders!    \"Man, talk about fantastic beings! It looked rather like a barrel  trotting along on four legs with four other arms or tentacles. It had no  head, just body and members and a row of eyes completely around it. The  top end of the barrel-body was a diaphragm stretched as tight as a drum  head, and that was all. It was pushing a little coppery cart and tore  right past us like the proverbial bat out of Hell. It didn't even notice  us, although I thought the eyes on my side shifted a little as it  passed.    \"A moment later another came along, pushing another empty cart. Same  thing--it just scooted past us. Well, I wasn't going to be ignored by a  bunch of barrels playing train, so when the third one approached, I  planted myself in the way--ready to jump, of course, if the thing didn't  stop.    \"But it did. It stopped and set up a sort of drumming from the diaphragm  on top. And I held out both hands and said, 'We are friends!' And what  do you suppose the thing did?\"    \"Said, 'Pleased to meet you,' I'll bet!\" suggested Harrison.    \"I couldn't have been more surprised if it had! It drummed on its  diaphragm, and then suddenly boomed out, 'We are v-r-r-riends!' and gave  its pushcart a vicious poke at me! I jumped aside, and away it went  while I stared dumbly after it.    \"A minute later another one came hurrying along. This one didn't pause,  but simply drummed out, 'We are v-r-r-riends!' and scurried by. How did  it learn the phrase? Were all of the creatures in some sort of  communication with each other? Were they all parts of some central  organism? I don't know, though I think Tweel does.    \"Anyway, the creatures went sailing past us, every one greeting  us with the same statement. It got to be funny; I never thought to  find so many friends on this God-forsaken ball! Finally I made a  puzzled gesture to Tweel; I guess he understood, for he said,  'One-one-two--yes!--two-two-four--no!' Get it?\"    \"Sure,\" said Harrison, \"It's a Martian nursery rhyme.\"    \"Yeah! Well, I was getting used to Tweel's symbolism, and I figured it  out this way. 'One-one-two--yes!' The creatures were intelligent.  'Two-two-four--no!' Their intelligence was not of our order, but  something different and beyond the logic of two and two is four. Maybe I  missed his meaning. Perhaps he meant that their minds were of low  degree, able to figure out the simple things--'One-one-two--yes!'--but  not more difficult things--'Two-two-four--no!' But I think from what we  saw later that he meant the other.    \"After a few moments, the creatures came rushing back--first one, then  another. Their pushcarts were full of stones, sand, chunks of rubbery  plants, and such rubbish as that. They droned out their friendly  greeting, which didn't really sound so friendly, and dashed on. The  third one I assumed to be my first acquaintance and I decided to have  another chat with him. I stepped into his path again and waited.    \"Up he came, booming out his 'We are v-r-r-riends' and stopped. I looked  at him; four or five of his eyes looked at me. He tried his password  again and gave a shove on his cart, but I stood firm. And then the--the  dashed creature reached out one of his arms, and two finger-like nippers  tweaked my nose!\"    \"Haw!\" roared Harrison. \"Maybe the things have a sense of beauty!\"    \"Laugh!\" grumbled Jarvis. \"I'd already had a nasty bump and a mean  frostbite on that nose. Anyway, I yelled 'Ouch!' and jumped aside and  the creature dashed away; but from then on, their greeting was 'We are  v-r-r-riends! Ouch!' Queer beasts!    \"Tweel and I followed the road squarely up to the nearest mound. The  creatures were coming and going, paying us not the slightest attention,  fetching their loads of rubbish. The road simply dived into an opening,  and slanted down like an old mine, and in and out darted the  barrel-people, greeting us with their eternal phrase.    \"I looked in; there was a light somewhere below, and I was curious to  see it. It didn't look like a flame or torch, you understand, but more  like a civilized light, and I thought that I might get some clue as to  the creatures' development. So in I went and Tweel tagged along, not  without a few trills and twitters, however.    \"The light was curious; it sputtered and flared like an old arc light,  but came from a single black rod set in the wall of the corridor. It  was electric, beyond doubt. The creatures were fairly civilized,  apparently.    \"Then I saw another light shining on something that glittered and I went  on to look at that, but it was only a heap of shiny sand. I turned  toward the entrance to leave, and the Devil take me if it wasn't gone!    \"I suppose the corridor had curved, or I'd stepped into a side passage.  Anyway, I walked back in that direction I thought we'd come, and all I  saw was more dimlit corridor. The place was a labyrinth! There was  nothing but twisting passages running every way, lit by occasional  lights, and now and then a creature running by, sometimes with a  pushcart, sometimes without.    \"Well, I wasn't much worried at first. Tweel and I had only come a few  steps from the entrance. But every move we made after that seemed to get  us in deeper. Finally I tried following one of the creatures with an  empty cart, thinking that he'd be going out for his rubbish, but he ran  around aimlessly, into one passage and out another. When he started  dashing around a pillar like one of these Japanese waltzing mice, I gave  up, dumped my water tank on"]]]
