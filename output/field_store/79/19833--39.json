But it hides them from the  dwellers in the Panjab, and its snowy crest is a very striking picture  as seen in the cold weather from the plains of Rawalpindi, Jhelam, and  Gujrat. The Outer Himalaya is continued beyond the gorges of the Jhelam  and Kishnganga rivers in Kajnag and the hills of the Hazara district.  Near the eastern extremity of the Dhauladhar section of the Outer  Himalaya it sends out southwards between Kulu and Mandi a lower  offshoot. This is crossed by the Babbu (9480 feet) and Dulchi passes,  connecting Kulu with Kangra through Mandi. Geologically the Kulu-Mandi  range appears to be continued to the east of the Bias and across the  Sutlej over Hattu and the Chor to the hills near Masuri (Mussoorie), a  well-known hill station in the United Provinces. Another offshoot at the  western end of the Dhauladhar passes through the beautiful hill station  of Dalhousie, and sinks into the low hills to the east of the Ravi,  where it leaves Chamba and enters the British district of Gurdaspur.    ~River Valleys and Passes in the Himalaya.~--While these principal chains  can be traced from south-east to north-west over hundreds of miles it  must be remembered that the Himalaya is a mountain mass from 150 to 200  miles broad, that the main axes are linked together by subsidiary cross  chains dividing the head waters of great rivers, and flanked by long and  lofty ridges running down at various angles to the gorges of these  streams and their tributaries. The typical Himalayan river runs in a  gorge with mountains dipping down pretty steeply to its sides. The lower  slopes are cultivated, but the land is usually stony and uneven, and as  a whole the crops are not of a high class. The open valleys of the  Jhelam in Kashmir and of the Bias in Kulu are exceptions. Passes in the  Himalaya are not defiles between high cliffs, but cross the crest of a  ridge at a point where the chain is locally depressed, and snow melts  soonest. In the Outer and Mid Himalaya the line of perpetual snow is at  about 16,000 feet, but for six months of the year the snow-line comes  down 5000 feet lower. In the Inner Himalaya and the Muztagh-Karakoram,  to which the monsoon does not penetrate, the air is so dry that less  snow falls and the line is a good deal higher.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. R. Jhelam in Kashmir--View towards Mohand Marg.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Near Naran in Kagan Glen, Hazara.]    ~Himalayan Scenery.~--Certain things strike any observant traveller in the  Himalaya. One is the comparative absence of running or still water,  except in the height of the rainy season, away from the large rivers.  The slope is so rapid that ordinary falls of rain run off with great  rapidity. The mountain scenery is often magnificent and the forests are  beautiful, but the absence of water robs the landscape of a charm which  would make it really perfect. Where this too is present, as in the  valley of the Bias in Kulu and those of the Jhelam and its tributaries  in Kashmir and Hazara, the eye has its full fruition of content.  Another is the silence of the forests. Bird and beast are there, but  they are little in evidence. A third feature which can hardly be missed  is the contrast between the northern and the southern slopes. The former  will often be clothed with forest while the latter is a bare stony slope  covered according to season with brown or green grass interspersed with  bushes of indigo, barberry, or the hog plum (Prinsepia utilis). The  reason is that the northern side enjoys much more shade, snow lies  longer, and the supply of moisture is therefore greater. The grazier for  the same reason is less tempted to fire the hill side in order to  promote the growth of grass, a practice which is fatal to all forest  growth. The rich and varied flora of the Himalaya will be referred to  later.    ~Muztagh-Karakoram Ranges.~--The Muztagh-Karakoram mountains form the  northern watershed of the Indus. The range consists of more than one  main axis. The name Karakoram is appropriated to the eastern part of the  system which originates at E. longitude 79 deg. near the Pangong lake in the  Tibetan plateau a little beyond the boundary of Kashmir. Beyond the  Karakoram pass (18,550 ft.) is a lofty bleak upland with salt lakes  dotted over its surface. Through this inhospitable region and over the  Karakoram pass and the Sasser-la (17,500 ft.) the trade route from  Yarkand to Leh runs. The road is only open for three months in the year,  and the dangers and hardships are great. In 1898 Dr Bullock Workman and  his wife marched along it across the Shyok river, up the valley of the  Nubra, and over the Sasser-la to the Karakoram pass. The scenery is an  exaggeration of that described by Dr Neve as seen on the road from the  Zoji-la to Leh. There is a powerful picture of its weird repellent  grandeur in the Workmans' book entitled _In the Ice World of Himalaya_  (pp. 28-29, 30-32). The poet who had found ideas for a new Paradiso in  the Vale of Kashmir might here get suggestions for a new Inferno.    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Muztagh-Karakoram and Himalayan Ranges in  Kashmir.]    The Karakoram range culminates in the north-west near the Muztagh pass  in a group of majestic peaks including K 2 or Mount Godwin Austen  (28,265 feet), Gasherbrum, and Masherbrum, which tower over and feed the  vast Boltoro glacier. The first of these giants is the second largest  mountain in the world. The Duke of the Abruzzi ascended it to the height  of 24,600 feet, and so established a climbing record. The Muztagh chain  carries on the northern bastion to the valley of the Hunza river and  the western extremity of the Hindu Kush. It has several peaks exceeding  25,000 feet. The most famous is Rakiposhi which looks down on Hunza from  a height of 25,550 feet.    ~The Hindu Kush.~--The Muztagh chain from the south-east, the Sarikol from  the north-east, and the Hindu Kush from the south-west, meet at a point  to the north of Hunza. The last runs westward and south-westward for  about 200 miles to the Dorah pass (14,800 feet), separating the valleys  which drain into the Indus from the head waters of the Oxus, and Hunza  and Gilgit in Kashmir and Chitral in British India from the Afghan  province of Wakhan. The highest point in the main axis, Sad Istragh  (24,171 feet), is in this section. But the finest mountain scenery in  the Hindu Kush is in the great spurs it thrusts out southwards to flank  the glens which feed the Gilgit and Chitral rivers. Tirach Mir towers  above Chitral to a height of 25,426 feet. From Tibet to the Dorah pass  the northern frontier of India is impregnable. It is pierced by one or  two difficult trade routes strewn with the bones of pack animals, but no  large army has ever marched across it for the invasion of India. West of  the Dorah pass the general level of the Hindu Kush is a good deal lower  than that of its eastern section. The vital point in the defences of  India in this quarter lies near Charikar to the north of Kabul, where  the chain thins out, and three practicable passes debouch on the valley  of the Kabul river. It is this fact that gives the town of Kabul its  great strategic importance. The highest of the three passes, the Kaoshan  or Hindu Kush (dead Hindu), crosses the chain at an elevation of 14,340  feet. It took its own name from the fate that befel a Hindu army when  attempting to cross it, and has handed it on to the whole range. It is  the pass which the armies of Alexander and Babar used. The historical  road for the invasion of India on this side has been by Charikar and the  valley of the Kabul river to its junction with the Kunar below  Jalalabad, thence up the Kunar valley and over one of the practicable  passes which connect its eastern watershed with the Panjkora and Swat  river valleys, whence the descent on Peshawar is easy. This is the route  by which Alexander led the wing of the Grecian army which he commanded  in person, and the one followed by Babar in 1518-19. Like Alexander,  Babar fought his way through Bajaur, and crossed the Indus above Attock.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. The Khaibar Road.]    ~The Khaibar.~--A British force advancing on Kabul from Peshawar has never  marched by the Kunar and Kabul valley route. It has always taken the  Khaibar road, which only follows the Kabul river for less than one-third  of the 170 miles which separate Peshawar from the Amir's capital. The  military road from Peshawar to Landikhana lies far to the south of the  river, from which it is shut off by difficult and rugged country held by  the Mohmands.    ~Safed Koh.~--From Landikhana the political boundary runs south-west to  the Safed Koh (white mountain) and is continued westwards along that  range to the Paiwar Kotal or pass (8450 feet). The Safed Koh forms the  watershed of the Kabul and Kurram rivers. It is a fine pine clad chain  with a general level of 12,000 feet, and its skyline is rarely free from  snow. It culminates in the west near Paiwar Kotal in Sikaram (15,620  feet). To the west of the Peshawar and Kohat districts is a tangle of  hills and valleys formed by outlying spurs of the Safed Koh. This  difficult country is in the occupation of Afridis and Orakzais, who are  under our political control.    ~The Kurram Valley.~--The line of advance into Afghanistan through the  Kurram valley is easy, and Lord Roberts used it when he marched towards  Kabul in 1898. After the war we annexed the valley, leaving however the  head waters of the Kurram in Afghan territory. The road to Kabul leaves  the river far to the south before it crosses our frontier at Paiwar  Kotal.    ~Waziristan Hills.~--Between the Kurram valley and the Gomal river is a  large block of very rough mountainous country known as Waziristan from  the turbulent clan which occupies it. In the north it is drained by the  Tochi."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#5)"],[1," bee-dress; though they will soon discard every thing of the  kind, unless they are of the number of those to whom the bees have a  special aversion. Such unfortunates are sure to be stung whenever they  show themselves in the vicinity of a bee-hive, and they will do well to  give the bees a very wide berth.    Apiarians have, for many years, employed the smoke of tobacco for  subduing their bees. It deprives them, at once, of all disposition to  sting, but it ought never to be used for such a purpose. If the  construction of the hives will not permit the bees to be sprinkled with  sugar water, the smoke of burning paper or rags will answer every  purpose, and the bees will not be likely to resent it; whereas when they  recover from the effect of the tobacco, they not unfrequently remember,  and in no very gentle way, the operator who administered the nauseous  dose.    Let all your motions about your hives be gentle and slow. Accustom your  bees to your presence; never crush or injure them in any operation;  acquaint yourself fully with the principles of management detailed in  this treatise, and you will find that you have but little more reason to  dread the sting of a bee, than the horns of your favorite cow, or the  heels of your faithful horse.          CHAPTER III.    THE QUEEN OR MOTHER-BEE, THE DRONES, AND THE WORKERS; WITH VARIOUS  HIGHLY IMPORTANT FACTS IN THEIR NATURAL HISTORY.      Bees can flourish only when associated in large numbers, as a colony. In  a solitary state, a single bee is almost as helpless as a new-born  child; it is unable to endure even the ordinary chill of a cool summer  night.    If a strong colony of bees is examined, a short time before it swarms,  three different kinds of bees will be found in the hive.    1st. A bee of peculiar shape, commonly called the _Queen Bee_.    2d. Some hundreds, more or less, of large bees called _Drones_.    3d. Many thousands of a smaller kind, called _Workers_ or common bees,  and similar to those which are seen on the blossoms. A large number of  the cells will be found filled with honey and bee-bread; while vast  numbers contain eggs, and immature workers and drones. A few cells of  unusual size, are devoted to the rearing of young queens, and are  ordinarily to be found in a perfect condition, only in the swarming  season.    The _Queen-Bee_ is the only _perfect female_ in the hive, and all the  eggs are laid by her. The _Drones_ are the _males_, and the _Workers_  are _females_, whose ovaries or \"egg-bags\" are so _imperfectly  developed_ that they are incapable of breeding, and which retain the  instinct of females, only so far as to give the most devoted attention  to feeding and rearing the brood.    These facts have all been demonstrated repeatedly, and are as well  established as the most common facts in the breeding of our domestic  animals. The knowledge of them in their most important bearings, is  absolutely essential to all who expect to realize large profits from an  improved method of rearing bees. Those who will not acquire the  necessary information, if they keep bees at all, should manage them in  the old-fashioned way, which requires the smallest amount either of  knowledge or skill.    I am perfectly aware how difficult it is to reason with a large class of  bee-keepers, some of whom have been so often imposed upon, that they  have lost all faith in the truth of any statements which may be made by  any one interested in a patent hive, while others stigmatize all  knowledge which does not square with their own, as \"book-knowledge,\" and  unworthy the attention of practical men.    If any such read this book, let me remind them again, that all my  assertions may be put to the test. So long as the interior of a hive,  was to common observers, a profound mystery, ignorant and designing men  might assert what they pleased, about what passed in its dark recesses;  but now, when all that takes place in it, can, _in a few moments_, be  exposed to the _full light of day_, and every one who keeps bees, can  _see and examine_ for himself, the man who attempts to palm upon the  community, his own conceits for facts, will speedily earn for himself,  the character both of a fool and an impostor.    THE QUEEN BEE, or as she may more properly be called THE MOTHER BEE, is  the common mother of the whole colony. She reigns therefore, most  unquestionably, by a divine right, as every mother is, or ought to be, a  queen in her own family. Her shape is entirely different from that of  the other bees. While she is not near so bulky as a drone, her body is  longer, and of a more _tapering_, or sugar-loaf form than that of a  worker, so that she has somewhat of a wasp-like appearance. Her wings  are much shorter, in proportion, than those of the drone, or worker; the  under part of her body is of a golden color, and the upper part darker  than that of the other bees. Her motions are usually slow and matronly,  although she can, when she pleases, move with astonishing quickness.    No colony can long exist without the presence of this all-important  insect. She is just as necessary to its welfare, as the soul is to the  body, for a colony without a queen must as certainly perish, as a body  without the spirit hasten to inevitable decay.    She is treated by the bees, as every mother ought to be, by her  children, with the most unbounded respect and affection. A circle of her  loving offspring constantly surround her, testifying, in various ways,  their dutiful regard; offering her honey, from time to time, and always,  most politely getting out of her way, to give her a clear path when she  wishes to move over the combs. If she is taken from them, as soon as  they have ascertained their loss, the whole colony is thrown into a  state of the most intense agitation; all the labors of the hive are at  once abandoned; the bees run wildly over the combs, and frequently, the  whole of them rush forth from the hive, and exhibit all the appearance  of anxious search for their beloved mother. Not being able anywhere to  find her, they return to their desolate home, and by their mournful  tones, reveal their deep sense of so deplorable a calamity. Their note,  at such times, more especially when they first realize her loss, is of  a peculiarly mournful character; it sounds something like _a succession  of wails on the minor key_, and can no more be mistaken by the  experienced bee-keeper, for their ordinary, happy hum, than the piteous  moanings of a sick child can be confounded, by an anxious mother, with  its joyous crowings, when overflowing with health and happiness.    I am perfectly aware that all this will sound to many, much more like  romance than sober reality; but I have determined, in writing this book,  to state facts, however wonderful, just as they are; confident that they  will, before long, be universally received, and hoping that the many  wonders in the economy of the honey bee will not only excite a wider  interest in its culture, but will lead those who observe them, to adore  the wisdom of Him who gave them such admirable instincts. I cannot  refrain from quoting here, the forcible remarks of an English clergyman,  who appears to be a very great enthusiast in bee-culture.    \"Every bee-keeper, if he have only a soul to appreciate the works of  God, and an intelligence of an inquisitive order, cannot fail to become  deeply interested in observing the wonderful instincts, (instincts akin  to reason,) of these admirable creatures; at the same time that he will  learn many lessons of practical wisdom from their example. Having  acquired a knowledge of their habits, not a bee will buzz in his ear,  without recalling to him some of these lessons, and helping to make him  a wiser and a better man. It is certain that in all my experience, I  never yet met with a keeper of bees, who was not a respectable,  well-conducted member of society, and a moral, if not a religious  man.[1] It is evident, on reflection, that this pursuit, if well  attended to, must occupy some considerable share of a man's time and  thoughts. He must be often about his bees, which will help to counteract  the baneful effect of the village inn. \"_Whoever is fond of his bees is  fond of his home_,\" is an axiom of irrefragable truth, and one which  ought to kindle in every one's breast, a favorable regard for a pursuit  which has the power to produce so happy an influence. The love of home  is the companion of many other virtues, which, if not yet developed into  actual exercise, are still only dormant, and may be roused into wakeful  energy at any moment.\"    The fertility of the queen bee has been much under-estimated by most  writers. It is truly astonishing. During the height of the breeding  season, she will often, under favorable circumstances, lay from two to  three thousand eggs, a day! In my observing hives, I have seen her lay,  at the rate of six eggs a minute! The fecundity of the female of the  white ant, is much greater than this, as she will lay as many as sixty  eggs a minute! but then her eggs are simply extruded from her body, to  be carried by the workers into suitable nurseries, while the queen bee  herself deposits her eggs in their appropriate cells.      ON THE WAY IN WHICH THE EGGS OF THE QUEEN BEE ARE FECUNDATED.    I come now to a subject of great practical importance, and one which,  until quite recently, has been _attended_ with apparently insuperable  difficulties.    It has been noticed that the queen bee commences laying in the latter  part of winter, or early in spring, and long before there are any  drones or males in the hive. (See remarks on Drones.) In what way are  these eggs impregnated? Huber, by a long course of the most  indefatigable observations, threw much light upon this subject. Before  stating his discoveries, I must pay my humble tribute of gratitude and  admiration, to this wonderful man. It is mortifying to every scientific"]]]
