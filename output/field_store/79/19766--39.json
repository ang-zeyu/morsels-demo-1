In the first stands Queen Nefertari, languidly  sniffing at a lotus-flower as she passes on. The others are filled by  some of the Princes of the blood, who are going to take part in the  ceremony at the temple, chief among them the wizard Prince Khaemuas, the  greatest magician in Egypt, who has spells that can bring the dead from  their graves. Some in the crowd shrink from his keen eye, and mutter  that the papyrus roll which he holds so close to his breast was taken  from the grave of another magician Prince of ancient days, and that  Khaemuas will know no peace till it is restored. In a few minutes the  whole brilliant train has passed, dazzling the eyes with a blaze of gold  and white and scarlet; and crowds of courtiers stream after their  master, as fast as their feet can carry them, towards Karnak. You have  seen, if only for a moment, the greatest man on earth--the Great  Oppressor of Hebrew story. Very mighty and very proud he is; and he does  not dream that the little Hebrew boy whom his daughter has adopted, and  who is being trained in the priestly college at Heliopolis, will one day  humble all the pride of Egypt, and that the very name of Ramses shall be  best remembered because it is linked with that of Moses.          CHAPTER V    THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER      When you read about the Egyptians in the Bible, it seems as though they  were nearly always fighting; and, indeed, they did a good deal of  fighting in their time, as nearly every nation did in those old days.  But in reality they were not a great soldier people, like their rivals  the Assyrians, or the Babylonians. We, who have had so much to do with  their descendants, the modern Egyptians, and have fought both against  them and with them, know that the \"Gippy\" is not fond of soldiering in  his heart. He makes a very good, patient, hardworking soldier when he  has good officers; but he is not like the Soudanese, who love fighting  for fighting's sake. He much prefers to live quietly in his own native  village, and cultivate his own bit of ground. And his forefathers, in  these long-past days, were very much of the same mind. Often, of course,  they had to fight, when Pharaoh ordered them out for a campaign in the  Soudan or in Syria, and then they fought wonderfully well; but all the  time their hearts were at home, and they were glad to get back to their  farm-work and their simple pleasures. They were a peaceful, kindly,  pleasant race, with little of the cruelty and fierceness that you find  continually among the Assyrians.    [Illustration: PLATE 4.  RAMSES II. IN HIS WAR CHARIOT: SARDINIAN GUARDSMEN ON FOOT.]    In fact, the old Egyptian rather despised soldiering as a profession. He  thought it was rather a miserable, muddled kind of a job, in which,  unless you were a great officer, you got all the hard knocks and none  of the honours; and I am not sure that he was far wrong. His great  idea of a happy life was to get employment as a scribe, or, as we should  say, a clerk, to some big man or to the Government, to keep accounts and  write reports. Of course the people could not all be scribes; but an  Egyptian who had sons was never so proud as when he could get one of  them into a scribe's position, even though the young man might look down  upon his old father and his brothers, toiling on the land or serving in  the army.    A curious old book has come down to us from these ancient days, in which  the writer, who had been both a soldier and a high officer under  Government in what we should call the diplomatic service, has told a  young friend his opinion of soldiering as a profession. The young man  had evidently been dazzled with the idea of being in the cavalry, or,  rather, the chariotry, for the Egyptian soldiers did not ride on horses  like our cavalry, but drove them in chariots, in each of which there  were two men--the charioteer, to drive the two horses, and the soldier,  who stood beside the driver and fought with the bow, and sometimes with  the lance or sword.    But this wise old friend tells him that even to be in the chariotry is  not by any means a pleasant job. Of course it seems very nice at first.  The young man gets his new equipment, and thinks all the world of  himself as he goes home to show off his fine feathers.        \"He receives beautiful horses,       And rejoices and exults,       And returns with them to his town.\"    But then comes the inspection, and if he has not everything in perfect  order he has a bad time of it, for he is thrown down on the ground, and  beaten with sticks till he is sore all over.    But if the lot of the cavalry soldier is hard, that of the infantry-man  is harder. In the barracks he is flogged for every mistake or offence.  Then war breaks out, and he has to march with his battalion to Syria.  Day after day he has to tramp on foot through the wild hill-country, so  different from the flat, fertile homeland that he loves. He has to carry  all his heavy equipment and his rations, so that he is laden like a  donkey; and often he has to drink dirty water, which makes him ill.  Then, when the battle comes, he gets all the danger and the wounds,  while the Generals get all the credit. When the war is over, he comes  home riding on a donkey, a broken-down man, sick and wounded, his very  clothes stolen by the rascals who should have attended on him. Far  better, the wise man says, to be a scribe, and to remain comfortably at  home. I dare say it was all quite true, just as perhaps it would not be  very far from the truth at the present time; but, in spite of it all,  Pharaoh had his battles to fight, and he got his soldiers all right when  they were needed.    The Egyptian army was not generally a very big one. It was nothing like  the great hosts that we hear of nowadays, or read of in some of the old  histories. The armies that the Pharaohs led into Syria were not often  much bigger than what we should call an army corps nowadays--probably  about 20,000 men altogether, rarely more than 25,000. But in that number  you could find almost as many different sorts of men as in our own  Indian army. There would be first the native Egyptian spearmen and  bowmen--the spearmen with leather caps and quilted leather tunics,  carrying a shield and spear, and sometimes an axe, or a dagger, or  short sword--the bowmen, more lightly equipped, but probably more  dangerous enemies, for the Egyptian archers were almost as famous as the  old English bowmen, and won many a battle for their King. Then came the  chariot brigade, also of native Egyptians, men probably of higher rank  than the foot-soldiers. The chariots were very light, and it must have  been exceedingly difficult for the bowman to balance himself in the  narrow car, as it bumped and clattered over rough ground. The two horses  were gaily decorated, and often wore plumes on their heads. The  charioteer sometimes twisted the reins round his waist, and could take a  hand in the fighting if his companion was hard pressed, guiding his  horses by swaying his body to one side or the other.    Round the Pharaoh himself, as he stood in his beautiful chariot, marched  the royal bodyguard. It was made up of men whom the Egyptians called  \"Sherden\"--Sardinians, probably, who had come over the sea to serve for  hire in the army of the great King. They wore metal helmets, with a  round ball on the top and horns at the sides, carried round bossed  shields, and were armed with great heavy swords of much the same shape  as those which the Norman knights used to carry. Behind the native  troops and the bodyguard marched the other mercenaries--regiments of  black Soudanese, with wild-beast skins thrown over their ebony  shoulders; and light-coloured Libyans from the West, each with a couple  of feathers stuck in his leather skull-cap.    Scouts went on ahead to scour the country, and bring to the King reports  of the enemy's whereabouts. Beside the royal chariot there padded along  a strange, but very useful soldier--a great tame lion, which had been  trained to guard his master and fight with teeth and claws against his  enemies. Last of all came the transport train, with the baggage carried  on the backs of a long line of donkeys, and protected by a  baggage-guard. The Egyptians were good marchers, and even in the hot  Syrian sunshine, and across a rough country where roads were almost  unknown, they could keep up a steady fifteen miles a day for a week on  end without being fagged out.    Let us follow the fortunes of an Egyptian soldier through one of the  great battles of the nation's history. Menna was one of the most skilful  charioteers of the whole Egyptian army--so skilful that, though he was  still quite young, he was promoted to be driver of the royal war-chariot  when King Ramses II. marched out from Zaru, the frontier garrison town  of Egypt, to fight with the Hittites in Northern Syria. During all the  long march across the desert, through Palestine, and over the northern  mountain passes, no enemy was seen at all, and, though Menna was kept  busy enough attending to his horses and seeing that the chariot was in  perfect order, he was in no danger. But as the army began to wind down  the long valley of the Orontes towards the town of Kadesh, the scouts  were kept out in every direction, and the whole host was anxiously on  the lookout for the Hittite troops.    Kadesh came in sight at last. Far on the horizon its towers could be  seen, and the sun's rays sparkled on the river and on the broad moat  which surrounded the walls; but still no enemy was to be seen. The  scouts came in with the report that the Hittites had retreated  northwards in terror, and King Ramses imagined that Kadesh was going to  fall into his hands without a battle. His army was divided into four  brigades, and he himself hurried on rather rashly with the first  brigade, leaving the other three to straggle on behind him, widely  separated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22816"],[0,"The Adventures of Buster Bear (#5)"],[1,"amer!    It's a fact. Blacky the Crow is forever dreaming and scheming and almost  always it is of mischief. He is one of the smartest and cleverest of all  the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and all the  others know it. Blacky likes excitement. He wants something going on.  The more exciting it is, the better he likes it. Then he has a chance to  use that harsh voice of his, and how he does use it!    So now, as he sat in the top of the Big Hickory-tree beside the Smiling  Pool and looked down on all the little people gathered there, he was  very happy. In the first place he felt very important, and you know  Blacky dearly loves to feel important. They had all come at his  invitation to listen to a plan for seeing for themselves if it were  really true that Farmer Brown's boy was afraid of Buster Bear.    On the Big Rock in the Smiling Pool sat Little Joe Otter, Billy Mink,  and Jerry Muskrat. On his big, green lily-pad sat Grandfather Frog. On  another lily-pad sat Spotty the Turtle. On the bank on one side of the  Smiling Pool were Peter Rabbit, Jumper the Hare, Danny Meadow Mouse,  Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, Unc' Billy Possum, Striped Chipmunk and Old  Mr. Toad. On the other side of the Smiling Pool were Reddy Fox, Digger  the Badger, and Bobby Coon. In the Big Hickory-tree were Chatterer the  Red Squirrel, Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and Sammy Jay.    Blacky waited until he was sure that no one else was coming. Then he  cleared his throat very loudly and began to speak. \"Friends,\" said he.    Everybody grinned, for Blacky has played so many sharp tricks that no  one is really his friend unless it is that other mischief-maker, Sammy  Jay, who, you know, is Blacky's cousin. But no one said anything, and  Blacky went on.    \"Little Joe Otter has told us how he saw Farmer Brown's boy hurry home  when he found the footprint of Buster Bear on the edge of the Laughing  Brook, and how all the way he kept looking behind him, as if he were  afraid. Perhaps he was, and then again perhaps he wasn't. Perhaps he had  something else on his mind. You have made a hero of Buster Bear, because  you believe Little Joe's story. Now I don't say that I don't believe it,  but I do say that I will be a lot more sure that Farmer Brown's boy is  afraid of Buster when I see him run away myself. Now here is my plan:    \"To-morrow morning, very early, Sammy Jay and I will make a great fuss  near the edge of the Green Forest. Farmer Brown's boy has a lot of  curiosity, and he will be sure to come over to see what it is all about.  Then we will lead him to where Buster Bear is. If he runs away, I will  be the first to admit that Buster Bear is as great a hero as some of you  seem to think he is. It is a very simple plan, and if you will all hide  where you can watch, you will be able to see for yourselves if Little  Joe Otter is right. Now what do you say?\"    Right away everybody began to talk at the same time. It was such a  simple plan that everybody agreed to it. And it promised to be so  exciting that everybody promised to be there, that is, everybody but  Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle, who didn't care to go so far  away from the Smiling Pool. So it was agreed that Blacky should try his  plan the very next morning.          XII    FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND BUSTER BEAR GROW CURIOUS      Ever since it was light enough to see at all, Blacky the Crow had been  sitting in the top of the tallest tree on the edge of the Green Forest  nearest to Farmer Brown's house, and never for an instant had he taken  his eyes from Farmer Brown's back door. What was he watching for? Why,  for Farmer Brown's boy to come out on his way to milk the cows.  Meanwhile, Sammy Jay was slipping silently through the Green Forest,  looking for Buster Bear, so that when the time came he could let his  cousin, Blacky the Crow, know just where Buster was.    By and by the back door of Farmer Brown's house opened, and out stepped  Farmer Brown's boy. In each hand he carried a milk pail. Right away  Blacky began to scream at the top of his lungs. \"Caw, caw, caw!\" shouted  Blacky. \"Caw, caw, caw!\" And all the time he flew about among the trees  near the edge of the Green Forest as if so excited that he couldn't keep  still. Farmer Brown's boy looked over there as if he wondered what all  that fuss was about, as indeed he did, but he didn't start to go over  and see. No, Sir, he started straight for the barn.    Blacky didn't know what to make of it. You see, smart as he is and  shrewd as he is, Blacky doesn't know anything about the meaning of duty,  for he never has to work excepting to get enough to eat. So, when Farmer  Brown's boy started for the barn instead of for the Green Forest,  Blacky didn't know what to make of it. He screamed harder and louder  than ever, until his voice grew so hoarse he couldn't scream any more,  but Farmer Brown's boy kept right on to the barn.    \"I'd like to know what you're making such a fuss about, Mr. Crow, but  I've got to feed the cows and milk them first,\" said he.    Now all this time the other little people of the Green Forest and the  Green Meadows had been hiding where they could see all that went on.  When Farmer Brown's boy disappeared in the barn, Chatterer the Red  Squirrel snickered right out loud. \"Ha, ha, ha! This is a great plan of  yours, Blacky! Ha, ha, ha!\" he shouted. Blacky couldn't find a word to  say. He just hung his head, which is something Blacky seldom does.    \"Perhaps if we wait until he comes out again, he will come over here,\"  said Sammy Jay, who had joined Blacky. So it was decided to wait. It  seemed as if Farmer Brown's boy never would come out, but at last he  did. Blacky and Sammy Jay at once began to scream and make all the fuss  they could. Farmer Brown's boy took the two pails of milk into the  house, then out he came and started straight for the Green Forest. He  was so curious to know what it all meant that he couldn't wait another  minute.    Now there was some one else with a great deal of curiosity also. He had  heard the screaming of Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, and he had  listened until he couldn't stand it another minute. He just _had_ to  know what it was all about. So at the same time Farmer Brown's boy  started for the Green Forest, this other listener started towards the  place where Blacky and Sammy were making such a racket. He walked very  softly so as not to make a sound. It was Buster Bear.          XIII    FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND BUSTER BEAR MEET        If you should meet with Buster Bear      While walking through the wood,    What would you do? Now tell me true,      _I'd_ run the best I could.    That is what Farmer Brown's boy did when he met Buster Bear, and a lot  of the little people of the Green Forest and some from the Green Meadows  saw him. When Farmer Brown's boy came hurrying home from the Laughing  Brook without any fish one day and told about the great footprint he had  seen in a muddy place on the bank deep in the Green Forest, and had said  his was sure that it was the footprint of a Bear, he had been laughed  at. Farmer Brown had laughed and laughed.    \"Why,\" said he, \"there hasn't been a Bear in the Green Forest for years  and years and years, not since my own grandfather was a little boy, and  that, you know, was a long, long, long time ago. If you want to find Mr.  Bear, you will have to go to the Great Woods. I don't know who made that  footprint, but it certainly couldn't have been a Bear. I think you must  have imagined it.\"    Then he had laughed some more, all of which goes to show how easy it is  to be mistaken, and how foolish it is to laugh at things you really  don't know about. Buster Bear _had_ come to live in the Green Forest,  and Farmer Brown's boy _had_ seen his footprint. But Farmer Brown  laughed so much and made fun of him so much, that at last his boy began  to think that he must have been mistaken after all. So when he heard  Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay making a great fuss near the edge of the  Green Forest, he never once thought of Buster Bear, as he started over  to see what was going on.    When Blacky and Sammy saw him coming, they moved a little farther in to  the Green Forest, still screaming in the most excited way. They felt  sure that Farmer Brown's boy would follow them, and they meant to lead  him to where Sammy had seen Buster Bear that morning. Then they would  find out for sure if what Little Joe Otter had said was true,--that  Farmer Brown's boy really was afraid of Buster Bear.    Now all around, behind trees and stumps, and under thick branches, and  even in tree tops, were other little people watching with round,  wide-open eyes to see what would happen. It was very exciting, the most  exciting thing they could remember. You see, they had come to believe  that Farmer Brown's boy wasn't afraid of anybody or anything, and as  most of them were very much afraid of him, they had hard work to believe  that he would really be afraid of even such a great, big, strong fellow  as Buster Bear. Every one was so busy watching Farmer Brown's boy that  no one saw Buster coming from the other direction.    You see, Buster walked very softly. Big as he is, he can walk without  making the teeniest, weeniest sound. And that is how it happened that no  one saw him or heard him until just as Farmer Brown's boy stepped out  from behind one side of a thick little hemlock-tree, Buster Bear stepped  out from behind the other side of that same little tree, and there they  were face to face! Then everybody held their breath, even Blacky the  Crow and Sammy Jay. For just a little minute it was so still there in  the Green Forest that not the least little sound could be heard. What  was going to happen?          XIV    A SURPRISING THING HAPPENS      Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, looking down from the top of a tall tree,  held their breath.
