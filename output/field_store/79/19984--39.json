In such circumstances Man places some allurement in the  neighbourhood--that is to say, one of the foods preferred by the  desired victim, or at least some object which recalls the form of that  food, as, for example, an artificial fly to obtain possession of  certain fishes.    It is curious to find that fish themselves utilise this system; it is  the method adopted by the Angler and the _Uranoscopus_.[14] The  _Uranoscopus scaber_ lives in the Mediterranean. At the end of his  lower jaw there is developed a mobile and supple filament which he is  able to use with the greatest dexterity. Concealed in the mud, without  moving and only allowing the end of his head to emerge, he agitates  and vibrates his filament. The little fishes who prowl in the  neighbourhood, delighted with the sight of this apparent worm,  regarding it as a destined prey, throw themselves on to it, but before  they are able to bite and recognise their error they have disappeared  in the mouth of the proprietor of the bait.       [14] Lacepede, _Histoire des Poissons_, 1798-1803.    The Angler (_Lophius piscatorius_) has not usurped his rather  paradoxical name. He retires to the midst of the sea-weed and algae. On  his body and all round his head he bears fringed appendages which, by  their resemblance to the leaves of marine plants, aid the animal to  conceal himself. The colour of his body also does not contrast with  neighbouring objects. From his head arise three movable filaments  formed by three spines detached from the upper fin. He makes use of  the anterior one, which is the longest and most supple. Working in the  same way as the _Uranoscopus_, the Angler agitates his three  filaments, giving them as much as possible the appearance of worms,  and thus attracting the little fish on which he feeds.    In these two examples we see a special organ utilised for a particular  function; it is one of the intermediate cases, already referred to,  between the true industries involving ingenuity and the simple  phenomena due to adaptations and modifications of the body.    _Hunting in the dwelling or in the burrow._--All these methods of  hunting or of fishing by surprise are for the most part practised by  the less agile species which cannot obtain their prey by superior  fleetness. Midway between these two methods may be placed that which  consists in surprising game when some circumstance has rendered it  motionless. Sometimes it is sleep which places it at the mercy of the  hunter, whose art in this case consists in seeking out its dwelling.  Sometimes he profits by the youth of the victim, like all  bird-nesters, whose aim is to eat the eggs or to devour the young  while still incapable of flying. The animals who eat birds' eggs are  numerous both among mammals and reptiles, as well as among birds  themselves.    The Alligator of Florida and of Louisiana delights in this chase. He  seeks in particular the Great Boat-Tail (_Quiscalus major_) which  nests in the reeds at the edge of marshes and ponds. When the young  have come out and are expecting from their parents the food which the  chances of the hunt may delay, they do not cease chirping and calling  by their cries. But the parents are not alone in hearing these  appeals. They may also strike the ears of the alligator, who furtively  approaches the imprudent singers. With a sudden stroke of his tail he  strikes the reeds and throws into the water one or more of the hungry  young ones, who are then at his mercy. (Audubon.)    The animals who feed on species living in societies either seize on  their prey when isolated or when all the members of the colony are  united in their city. A search for the nest is necessary in the case  of creatures who are very small in comparison with the hunter, as in  the case of ants and the Ant-eater. But the ant-eater possesses a very  long and sticky tongue, which renders the capture of these insects  extremely easy; when he finds a frequented passage it is enough to  stretch out his tongue; all the ants come of their own accord and  place themselves on it, and when it is sufficiently charged he  withdraws it and devours them. The African _Orycteropus_ (Fig. 2), who  is also a great eater of ants and especially of termites, is equally  aided by a very developed tongue; but he has less patience than the  ant-eater, and he adds to this resource other proceedings which render  the hunt more fruitful and enable him to obtain a very large number of  insects at one time. Thanks to his keenness of scent he soon discovers  an ant-path bearing the special and characteristic odour which these  Hymenoptera leave behind them, and he follows the track which leads to  their nest. On arriving there, without troubling himself about the  scattered insects that prowl in the neighbourhood, he sets himself to  penetrate into the midst of the dwelling, and with his strong claws  hollows out a passage which enables him to gain access. On the way he  pierces walls, breaks down floors, gathering here and there some  fugitives, and arrives at last at the centre, in which millions of  animals swarm. He then swallows them in large mouthfuls and retires,  leaving behind him a desert and a ruin in the spot before occupied by  a veritable palace, full of prodigious activity.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The colonies are not only exposed to the devastations of those who  feed on their members; they have other enemies in the animals who  covet their stores of food. The most inveterate robber of bees is the  nocturnal Death's Head Moth. When he has succeeded in penetrating the  hive the stings of the proprietors who throw themselves on him do not  trouble him, thanks to his thick fleece of long hairs which the sting  cannot penetrate; he makes his way to the cells, rips them open,  gorges himself with honey, and causes such havoc that in Switzerland,  in certain years when these butterflies were abundant, numbers of  hives have been found absolutely empty.[15] Many other marauders and  of larger size, such as the Bear, also spread terror among these  laborious insects and empty their barns. No animal is more crafty than  the Raven, and the fabulist who wished to make him a dupe was obliged  to oppose to him the very cunning Fox in order to render the tale  fairly life-like. A great number of stories are told concerning the  Raven's cleverness, and many of them are undoubtedly true. There is no  bolder robber of nests. He swallows the eggs and eats the little ones  of the species who cannot defend themselves against him; he even seeks  the eggs of Sea-gulls on the coast; but in this case he must use  cunning, for if he is discovered it means a serious battle. On the  coast also the Raven seeks to obtain possession of the Hermit-crab.  This Crustacean dwells in the empty shells of Gasteropods. At the  least alarm he retires within this shell and becomes invisible, but  the bird advances with so much precaution that he is often able to  seize the crab before he has time to hide himself. If the raven fails  he turns the shell over and over until the impatient crustacean allows  a claw to emerge; he is then seized and immediately devoured.       [15] Huber, _Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles_,          t. ii. p. 291.    If there is a question of hunting larger game like a Hare, the Raven  prefers to take an ally. They start him at his burrow and pursue him  flying. In spite of his proverbial rapidity the hare is scarcely able  to flee more than two hundred yards. He succumbs beneath vigorous  blows on his skull from the beaks of his assailants. During winter, in  the high regions of the Alps, when the soil is covered with snow, this  chase is particularly fruitful for ravens. The story is told of that  unfortunate hare who had hollowed out in the snow a burrow with two  entrances. Two of these birds having recognised his presence, one  entered one hole in order to dislodge the hare, the other awaited him  at the other opening to batter his head with blows from his beak and  kill him before he had time to gain presence of mind.[16]       [16] F. von Tschuedi, _Les Alpes_, Berne and Paris, 1859.    Rooks sometimes hunt in burrows by ingeniously-concerted operations.  Mr. Bernard[17] has described the interesting way in which the Rook  hunts voles or field-mice in Thuringia. His curiosity was excited by  the way in which numerous rooks stood about a field cawing loudly. In  a few days this was explained: the field was covered with rooks; the  original assemblage had been calling together a mouse-hunt, which  could only be successfully carried out by a large number of birds  acting in conjunction. By diligently probing the ground and blocking  up the network of runs, the voles, one or more at a time, were  gradually driven into a corner. The hunt was very successful, and no  more voles were seen in that field during the winter.       [17] _Zoologist_, October 1892.    _Coursing._--Other animals are not easily discouraged by the swiftness  of their prey; they count on their own resistance in order to tire the  game; some of them also manage their pursuit in the most intelligent  way, so as to preserve their own strength while the tracked animal's  strength goes on diminishing until exhaustion and fatigue place him at  their mercy.    Mammals especially, such as Dogs, Wolves, and Foxes, exercise this  kind of chase; it is, exactly, the coursing which Man has merely had  to direct for his own benefit. Wild dogs pursue their prey united in  immense packs. They excite each other by barking while they frighten  the game and half paralyse his efforts. No animal is agile and strong  enough to be sure of escaping. They surround him and cut off his  retreat in a most skilful manner; Gazelles and Antelopes, in spite of  their extreme nimbleness and speed, are caught at last; Boars are  rapidly driven into a corner; their vigorous defence may cost the life  of some of the assailants, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#5)"],[1," stripped of their branches.  With two or three exceptions--probably the work of young beavers  unskilled in their art--the trees were felled unerringly in the  direction of the water, so as to minimize the labour of dragging down  the cuttings. Close to the new part of the canal, he found the tree  whose falling he and Jabe had heard the night before. It was a tall  yellow birch, fully twenty inches through at the place where it was  cut, some fifteen inches from the ground. The cutting was still fresh  and sappy. About half the branches had been gnawed off and trimmed,  showing that the beavers, after being disturbed by the Boy's visit to  the dam, had returned to work later in the night. Much of the smaller  brush, from the top, had been cleared away and dragged down to the  edge of the canal. As the Boy knew, from what trappers and woodsmen  had told him, this brush, and a lot more like it, would all be  anchored in a huge pile in mid-channel, a little above the dam, where  it would serve the double purpose of breaking the force of the floods  and of supplying food through the winter.    Very near the newly felled birch the Boy found another large tree  about half cut through; and he vowed to himself that he would see the  finish of that job that very night. He found the cutting done pretty  evenly all around the tree, but somewhat lower and deeper on the side  next to the water. In width the cut was less than that which a good  axeman would make--because the teeth of a beaver are a more frugal  cutting instrument than the woodsman's axe, making possible a  straighter and less wasteful cut. At the foot of this tree he picked  up chips fully eight inches in length, and was puzzled to imagine how  the beavers imitated the effect of the axe in making the chips fly  off.    For a couple of hours the Boy busied himself joyously, observing the  work of these cunning woodsmen's teeth, noting the trails by which the  remoter cuttings had been dragged down to the water, and studying the  excavations on the canal. Then, fearing to make the little citizens of  the pond so nervous that they might not come out to business that  night, he withdrew over the slope and made his way back to camp. He  would sleep out the rest of the afternoon to be fresh and keen for the  night's watching.    At supper that evening, beside the camp-fire, when the woods looked  magical under the still, white moon, Jabe Smith gradually got fired  with the Boy's enthusiasm. The Boy's descriptions of the canal  digging, of the structure of the dam, and, above all, of the battle  between the otter and the beavers, filled him with a new eagerness to  observe these wonderful little engineers with other eyes than those of  the mere hunter and trapper. In the face of all the Boy's exact  details he grew almost deferential, quite laying aside his usual  backwoods pose of indifference and half derision. He made no move to  go to bed, but refilled his pipe and watched his young comrade's face  with shrewd, bright eyes grown suddenly boyish.    At last the Boy rose and picked up his rifle.    \"I must hurry up and get myself hidden,\" said he, \"or I'll see nothing  to-night. Good night, Jabe. I'll not be back, likely, till along  toward morning.\"    The backwoodsman's usual response was not forthcoming. For some  seconds he fingered his rugged chin in silence. Then, straightening  himself up, he spoke with an air of mingled embarrassment and  carelessness.    \"Them beaver of yourn's certainly an interestin' kind of varmint.  D'ye know, blam'd if I ain't got a notion to go along with you  to-night, an' watch 'em myself!\"    The Boy, though secretly delighted at this evidence of something like  conversion, eyed Jabe doubtfully. He was not sure of the latter's  capacity for the tireless patience and long self-effacement necessary  for such an adventure as this.    \"Well, Jabe,\" he answered hesitatingly, \"you know well how more than  glad I'd be of your company. It would just about double my fun, having  you along, if you were really interested, as I am, you know. And are  you sure you could keep still long enough to see anything?\"    Jabe would have resented this halting acceptance of his companionship  had he not known in his heart that it was nothing more than he well  deserved. But the doubt cast upon his woodcraft piqued him.    \"Hain't I never set for hours in the wet ma'sh, never movin' a finger,  waitin' for the geese?\" he asked with injury in his voice. \"Hain't I  never sneaked up on a watchin' buck, or laid so still I've fooled a  bear?\"    The Boy chuckled softly at this outbreak, so unexpected in the  taciturn and altogether superior Jabe.    \"You're all right, Jabe!\" said he. \"I reckon you can keep still. But  you must let me be captain, for to-night! This is my trick.\"    \"Sartain,\" responded the woodsman with alacrity. \"I'll eat mud if you  say so! But I'll take along a hunk of cold bacon if you hain't got no  objection.\"    On the trail through the ghostly, moonlit woods, Jabe followed  obediently at the Boy's heels. Silently as shadows they moved,  silently as the lynx or the moose or the weasel goes through the  softly parting undergrowth. The Boy led far away from the brook, and  over the crest of the ridge, to avoid alarming the vigilant sentries.  As they approached the head of the canal, their caution redoubled, and  they went very slowly, bending low and avoiding every patch of  moonlight. The light breeze, so light as to be almost imperceptible,  drew upward toward them from the meadow, bringing now and then a scent  of the fresh-dug soil. At last the Boy lay down on his belly; and Jabe  religiously imitated him. For perhaps fifty yards they crept forward  inch by inch, till at length they found themselves in the heart of a  young fir thicket, through whose branches they could look out upon the  head of the canal and the trees where the beavers had most recently  been cutting.    Among the trees and in the water, all was still, with the mystic,  crystalline stillness of the autumn moonlight. In that light  everything seemed fragile and unreal, as if a movement or a breath  might dissolve it. After a waiting of some ten minutes Jabe had it on  the tip of his tongue to whisper, derisively, \"Nothin' doin'!\" But he  remembered the Boy's injunction, as well as his doubts, and checked  himself. A moment later a faint, swirling gurgle of water caught his  ear, and he was glad he had kept silence. An instant more, and the  form of a beaver, spectral-gray in the moonlight, took shape all at  once on the brink of the canal. For several minutes it stood there  motionless, erect upon its hind quarters, questioning the stillness  with eyes and ear and nose. Then, satisfied that there was no danger  near, it dropped on all fours and crept up toward the tree that was  partly cut through.    This pioneer of the woodcutters was followed immediately by three  others, who lost no time in getting down to work. One of them went to  help the leader, while the other two devoted themselves to trimming  and cutting up the branches of the big birch which they had felled  the night before. The Boy wondered where the rest of the pond-people  were, and would have liked to consult Jabe about it; but he remembered  the keenness of the beaver's ears, and held his tongue securely. It  seemed to him probably that they were still down in the pond, working  on the houses, the brush pile, or the dam. Presently one more was  accounted for. A renewed splashing in the canal turned the attention  of the watchers from the tree-cutting, and they saw that a single wise  excavator was at work, carrying forward the head of the ditch.    There was no impatience or desire to fidget left in Jabe Smith now. As  he watched the beavers at work in the moonlight, looking very  mysterious in their stealthy, busy, tireless diligence, and conducting  their toil with an ordered intelligence which seemed to him almost  human, he understood for the first time the Boy's enthusiasm for this  kind of bloodless hunting. He had always known how clever the beavers  were, and allowed them full credit; but till now he had never actually  realized it. The two beavers engaged in cutting down the tree sat  erect upon their haunches, supported by their huge tails, chiseling  indefatigably. Cutting two deep grooves, one about six or eight  inches, perhaps, above the other, they would then wrench off the chips  by main force with their teeth and forepaws, jerking their powerful  necks with a kind of furious impatience. As he noted how they made the  cut deeper and lower on one side than the other, that the tree might  fall as they wished, he was so delighted that he came dangerously near  vowing he would never trap a beaver again. He felt that it was almost  like ensnaring a brother woodsman.    Equally exciting was the work on the other tree, which was being  trimmed. The branches, according to their size, were cut into neat,  manageable lengths, of from three to six or seven feet--the less the  diameter the greater the length, each piece being calculated to be  handled in the water by one beaver. These pieces were then rolled,  shoved or dragged, as the case might require, down the smooth trails  already made in hauling the brush, and dumped into the canal. Other  beavers presently appeared, and began towing the sticks and brush down  the canal to the pond. This part of the process was hidden from the  eager watchers in the thicket; but the Boy guessed, from his own  experience in pushing a log endwise before him while in swimming, that  the beavers would handle the sticks in the same way. With the brush,  however, it was different. In hauling it down the trail each beaver  took a branch in his teeth, by the butt, twisted it across his  shoulders, and let it drag behind him. It was obvious that in the  water, too, this would be the most convenient way to handle such  material. The beavers were not the"]]]
