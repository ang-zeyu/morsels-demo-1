The religious dissensions which at this time agitated Germany were  accompanied in many places by much tumult and excitement. At Gratz the  Catholics threatened to expel the Protestants from the city. Kepler, who  was of the Reformed faith, having recognised the danger with which he  was threatened, retired to Hungary with his wife, whom he had recently  married, and remained there for near twelve months, during which time he  occupied himself with writing several short treatises on subjects  connected with astronomy. In 1599 he returned to Gratz and resumed his  professorship.    In the year 1600 Kepler set out to pay Tycho Brahe a visit at Prague, in  order that he might be able to avail himself of information contained in  observations made by Tycho with regard to the eccentricities of the  orbits of the planets. He was received by Tycho with much cordiality,  and stayed with him for four months at his residence at Benach, Tycho in  the meantime having promised that he would use his influence with the  Emperor Rudolph to have him appointed as assistant in his observatory.  On the termination of his visit Kepler returned to Gratz, and as there  was a renewal of the religious trouble in the city, he resigned his  professorship, from which he only derived a small income, and, relying  on Tycho's promise, he again journeyed to Prague, and arrived there in  1601. Kepler was presented to the Emperor by Tycho, and the post of  Imperial Mathematician was conferred upon him, with a salary of 100  florins a year, upon condition that he should assist Tycho in his  observatory. This appointment was of much value to Kepler, because it  afforded him an opportunity of obtaining access to the numerous  astronomical observations made by Tycho, which were of great assistance  to him in the investigation of the subject which he had chosen--viz. the  laws which govern the motions of the planets, and the form and size of  the planetary orbits.    As an acknowledgment of the Emperor's great kindness, the two  astronomers resolved to compute a new set of astronomical tables, and in  honour of his Majesty they were to be called the 'Rudolphine Tables.'  This project pleased the Emperor, who promised to defray the expense of  their publication. Logomontanus, Tycho's chief assistant, had entrusted  to him that portion of the work relating to observations on the stars,  and Kepler had charge of the part which embraced the calculations  belonging to the planets and their orbits. This important work had  scarcely been begun when the departure of Logomontanus, who obtained an  appointment in Denmark, and the death of Tycho Brahe in October 1601,  necessitated its suspension for a time. Kepler was appointed Chief  Mathematician to the Emperor in succession to Tycho--a position of  honour and distinction, and to which was attached a handsome salary,  that was paid out of the Imperial treasury. But owing to the continuance  of expensive wars, which entailed a severe drain upon the resources of  the country, the public funds became very low, and Kepler's salary was  always in arrear. This condition of things involved him in serious  pecuniary difficulties, and the responsibility of having to maintain an  increasing family added to his anxieties. It was with the greatest  difficulty that he succeeded in obtaining payment of even a portion of  his salary, and he was reduced to such straits as to be under the  necessity of casting nativities in order to obtain money to meet his  most pressing requirements.    In 1609 Kepler published his great work, entitled 'The New Astronomy;  or, Commentaries on the Motions of Mars.' It was by his observation of  Mars, which has an orbit of greater eccentricity than that of any of the  other planets, with the exception of Mercury, that he was enabled, after  years of patient study, to announce in this volume the discovery of two  of the three famous theorems known as Kepler's Laws. The first is, that  all the planets move round the Sun in elliptic orbits, and that the orb  occupies one of the foci. The second is, that the radius-vector, or  imaginary line joining the centre of the planet and the centre of the  Sun, describes equal areas in equal times. The third law, which relates  to the connection between the periodic times and the distances of the  planets, was not discovered until ten years later, when Kepler, in 1619,  issued another work, called the 'Harmonies of the World,' dedicated to  James I. of England, in which was contained this remarkable law. These  laws have elevated astronomy to the position of a true physical science,  and also formed the starting-point of Newton's investigations which led  to the discovery of the law of gravitation. Kepler's delight on the  discovery of his third law was unbounded. He writes: 'Nothing holds me.  I will indulge in my sacred fury. I will triumph over mankind by the  honest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians  to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt.  If you forgive me, I rejoice; if you are angry, I can bear it. The die  is cast; the book is written, to be read either now or by posterity I  care not which. It may well wait a century for a reader, as God has  waited six thousand years for an observer.'    When Kepler presented his celebrated book to the Emperor, he remarked  that it was his intention to make a similar attack upon the other  planets, and promised that he would be successful if his Majesty would  undertake to find the means necessary for carrying on operations. But  the Emperor had more formidable enemies to contend with nearer home than  Jupiter and Saturn, and no funds were forthcoming to assist Kepler in  his undertaking.    The chair of mathematics in the University of Linz having become vacant,  Kepler offered himself as a candidate for the appointment, which he was  anxious to obtain; but the Emperor Rudolph was averse to his leaving  Prague, and encouraged him to hope that the arrears of his salary would  be paid. But past experience led Kepler to have no very sanguine  expectations on this point; nor was it until after the death of Rudolph,  in 1612, that he was relieved from his pecuniary embarrassments.    On the accession of Rudolph's brother, Matthias, to the Austrian throne,  Kepler was reappointed Imperial Mathematician; he was also permitted to  hold the professorship at Linz, to which he had been elected. Kepler was  not loth to remove from Prague, where he had spent eleven years harassed  by poverty and other domestic afflictions. Having settled with his  family at Linz, Kepler issued another work, in 1618, entitled 'Epitome  of the Copernican Astronomy,' in which he gave a general account of his  astronomical observations and discoveries, and a summary of his opinions  with regard to the theories which in those days were the subject of  controversial discussion. Almost immediately after its publication it  was included by the Congregation of the Index, at Rome, in the list of  prohibited books. This occasioned Kepler considerable alarm, as he  imagined it might interfere with the sale of his works, or give rise to  difficulties in the issue of others. He, however, was assured by his  friend Remus that the action of the Papal authorities need cause him no  anxiety.    The Emperor Matthias died in 1619, and was succeeded by Ferdinand III.,  who not only retained Kepler in his office, but gave orders that all the  arrears of his salary should be paid, including those which accumulated  during the reign of Rudolph; he also expressed a desire that the  'Rudolphine Tables' should be published without delay and at his cost.  But other obstacles intervened, for at this time Germany was involved in  a civil and religious war, which interfered with all peaceful  vocations. Kepler's library at Linz was sealed up by order of the  Jesuits, and the city was for a time besieged by troops. This state of  public affairs necessitated a considerable delay in the publication of  the 'Tables.'    The 'Rudolphine Tables' were published at Ulm in 1627. They were  commenced by Tycho Brahe, and completed by Kepler, who made his  calculations from Tycho's observations, and based them upon his own  great discovery of the ellipticity of the orbits of the planets. They  are divided into four parts. The first and third parts contain  logarithmic and other tables for the purpose of facilitating  astronomical calculations; in the second are tables of the Sun, Moon,  and planets; and in the fourth are indicated the positions of one  thousand stars as determined by Tycho. Kepler made a special journey to  Prague in order to present the 'Tables' to the Emperor, and afterwards  the Grand Duke of Tuscany sent him a gold chain as an acknowledgment of  his appreciation of the completion of this great work.    Albert Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, an accomplished scholar and a man  fond of scientific pursuits, made Kepler a most liberal offer if he  would take up his residence in his dominions. After duly considering  this proposal, Kepler decided to accept the Duke's offer, provided it  received the sanction of the Emperor. This was readily given, and  Kepler, in 1629, removed with his family from Linz to Sagan, in Silesia.  The Duke of Friedland treated him with great kindness and liberality,  and through his influence he was appointed to a professorship in the  University of Rostock. Though Kepler was permitted to retain the pension  bestowed upon him by the late Emperor Rudolph, he was unable after his  removal to Silesia to obtain payment of it, and there was a large  accumulation of arrears. In a final endeavour to recover the amount  owing to him he travelled to Ratisbon, and appealed to the Imperial  Assembly, but without success. The fatigue which Kepler endured on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#5)"],[1,"  irritation.    These general rules borne in mind are sufficient to guide us into a  wiser life than if we do not understand them; and, understanding  these general principles, we will be anxious to study the particular  rules which govern digestion and assimilation.    I have known young women in college to be so absolutely ignorant or  indifferent to physiological law as to be injuring themselves  constantly by disobedience of such laws. I knew one girl, supposed to  be a very fine student, and to have brought on \"fits\" by overstudy,  while away at school. I had an opportunity to investigate the case,  and I discovered that she had been eating from morning till night. She  carried nuts, and candy, and apples in her pocket, had pickles and  cake in her room, and studied and munched until it was no doubt a  disturbed digestion, rather than an overused brain, that caused the  \"fits.\"    If you will eat regularly of plain meat, vegetables, fruits, cereals,  milk and eggs, plainly prepared, and avoid rich pastries, cakes,  puddings, pickles and sweetmeats, you will have compassed the round of  healthful diet, and need give yourself very little anxiety in regard  to anything more. I should like to emphasize the fact, however, that  tea and coffee are not foods. They are irritants, stimulants,  nerve-poisons. They bring nothing to the system to build it up. They  satisfy the sense of hunger without having contributed to the  nourishment of the body. If you are wise you will avoid them. You  will not create for yourself any false necessities. You will avoid  the use of alcohol in all forms, whether wine, ales, beer or cider, as  well as in the stronger forms, because you will know that these  products interfere with digestion. Dr. Kellogg, of Battle Creek, has  made an experiment which proved that sherry to the amount of 1 per  cent. of the contents of the stomach retarded digestion nearly 4 per  cent.    He calculates that 1 per cent. of sherry would be equal to two tenths  of 1 per cent. of alcohol, and it would be necessary to take less than  an ordinary tablespoonful of the wine to obtain this percentage.    When 3 per cent. of claret was used (equivalent to three-tenths of 1  per cent. of alcohol), there was marked diminution in digestive  activity. This certainly proves that even the so-called light wines  are injurious, and certainly the drinks that contain a large per cent.  of alcohol must be that much more hurtful.    If you use good judgment both as to the quality and quantity of foods,  you need then give the matter very little thought. People sometimes  make themselves dyspeptics by worrying about what they eat. Eat what  is set before you, making a judicious choice both as to variety and  quantity, and then determine that your food shall digest.    When you live upon the higher plane of thought, you will not be so  much interested in the question of food as regards gustatory  pleasure. You will understand that eating is a necessity, but you will  not be thinking about it; you will not be desiring to please the sense  of taste; you will see that there are higher forms of sociability than  mere eating with friends, and you will not be so interested in late  suppers, and in various forms of sense gratification because you enjoy  more thoroughly the higher pleasures. You will serve your friends with  delicate food, simply and daintily prepared, and seasoned with that  wit and wisdom which remain as a permanent mental pabulum. You will  make them feel that when you come to visit them you come not to get  something to eat, but to enjoy them, to receive from them the  inspiration which they can give. We often treat our friends as if we  thought they came as beggars for physical food. It is a much higher  compliment to treat them as though we thought they came to exchange  thoughts with us, to walk with us in the higher paths of living, and  that the physical food we give them is only incidental. I was once  entertained where a company of intelligent, cultured people were  assembled, and we did not see the hostess from the time we entered the  house until supper was served. She sat at the table, worried and  anxious, and after the supper was over she did not make her appearance  until just as we were about to leave. She did not pay us the high  compliment of giving us herself, but she bestowed upon us that which a  hired cook might have given.    You remember what Emerson says: \"I pray you, O excellent wife, cumber  not yourself and me to get a curiously rich dinner for this man and  woman who have just alighted at our gate. These things, if they desire  them, they can get for a few shillings at any village inn; but rather  let that stranger see, if he will, in your looks, accents and  behavior, your heart and earnestness, your thought and will, that  which he cannot buy at any price in any city, and which he may travel  miles and dine sparely and sleep hardly to behold.\"    It would indeed be worth your while to study food scientifically, to  know how to prepare dainty and tempting dishes wholesomely, and then  to serve your guests with such beauty of manner, such graciousness of  courtesy, that they will remember the meal they have taken with you as  idyllic in its simplicity, beauty and helpfulness.          CHAPTER IV.    SLEEP.      Shakespeare writes of \"Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve of  care.\" The metaphor is striking, but not accurate. To knit up that  which is ravelled implies using the old material in repairing the  damage, but that is not the way in which the body is rebuilt. The old  material is thrown out and new material put in its place, and that  largely takes place during sleep. We have read of brownies who came at  night and swept and churned and baked while the housewife slept. So,  in our bodily dwelling, the vital forces are our brownies, and they  can work more uninterruptedly while we are asleep than when we are  calling on them to move us from place to place, or to aid us in  various activities.    Much of life's processes must remain a mystery to us, but certain  things we have learned, and one is that perfect health cannot be  maintained, strong nerves cannot be constructed, nor a clear brain be  built without plenty of sleep. The baby sleeps almost continually  because he is building so much new structure. The growing child needs  more sleep than the adult; but even after reaching maturity sleep  cannot be materially lessened without injury to the whole  organization.    We appreciate the need of food. We are often very needlessly alarmed  for fear that we shall starve from one meal to the next, but few of us  realize that food cannot be assimilated, built into tissue, without  some hours in which the vital forces can devote themselves wholly to  the work of assimilation. During the working hours of the day we are  expending force. The brain is using it in thought, the muscles are  calling for force in various activities, the emotions are expending  energy, and each of these activities is creating changes in the cells  of the body. We know that life in the body is only possible through  constant death of the atoms of which it is composed. We can only live  because we are constantly dying. Huxley says, \"For every vital act,  life is used up. All work implies waste, and the work of life results  directly or indirectly in the waste of protoplasm (which is the cell  substance). Every word uttered by a speaker costs him some physical  loss, and in the strictest sense he burns that others may have light.\"    Each word, thought, activity, emotion causes expenditure, and unless  expenditure is in some way made good, there will be bankruptcy. How  shall we get back the energy we have expended and so restore our vital  forces to their equilibrium? The protoplasm of which our cells are  made we can obtain from the protoplasm of animal and vegetable  substances which we eat, but we cannot use the material unless we are  sometimes at rest, and by quiescence of brain and muscle give a chance  for worn-out cells to be removed and new material put in their place.  It is when we lay our bodies down in the beautiful repose of slumber  that this process can go on with most perfect results. Then, when all  the forces can be concentrated on the process of nutrition, will  nutrition be most perfect. When we awake refreshed after a night of  sound sleep we are really fed. It is quite doubtful if, in a normal  condition, we would want food until we had been at work some time and  by destroying tissue have created a demand for more new material.    If we were only half as anxious that food should be assimilated--that  is, made over into ourselves--as we are that it should be put into the  stomach, we would be very careful to secure for ourselves a due amount  of good sleep. And what is a due amount? That depends. I once heard of  a servant girl whose mistress complained of her because she did not  get up early in the morning, and the girl's excuse was, \"But, ma'am, I  can't get up early because I sleep so slow.\"    It seems a ridiculous statement, and yet there is a germ of truth in  it. In some people the vital processes go on with such rapidity that  the old, worn-out material will be eliminated and the new material  built into the body in a comparatively short time. Seven hours of good  sleep, perhaps, make them feel strong and rested and able to start on  a new day's work with courage and ease. In others the vital processes  are hindered or work feebly and slowly, and eight or nine hours of  sleep scarcely suffice to complete the work of restoration. What is  the obvious inference? Simply that each one shall judge for himself;  but each should be wise enough not to confuse sleeplessness with  having had sufficient sleep.    Very frequently the loss of sleep makes it difficult or impossible to  sleep, and not until the excited condition of nerves can be calmed,  can refreshing slumber be"]]]
