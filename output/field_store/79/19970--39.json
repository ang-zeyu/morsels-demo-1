When he was six years of age his mother, beautiful, long-haired Muirne,  came to see him. She came secretly, for she feared the sons of Morna,  and she had paced through lonely places in many counties before she  reached the hut in the wood, and the cot where he lay with his fists  shut and sleep gripped in them.    He awakened to be sure. He would have one ear that would catch an  unusual voice, one eye that would open, however sleepy the other one  was. She took him in her arms and kissed him, and she sang a sleepy song  until the small boy slept again.    We may be sure that the eye that could stay open stayed open that night  as long as it could, and that the one ear listened to the sleepy song  until the song got too low to be heard, until it was too tender to be  felt vibrating along those soft arms, until Fionn was asleep again, with  a new picture in his little head and a new notion to ponder on.    The mother of himself! His own mother!    But when he awakened she was gone.    She was going back secretly, in dread of the sons of Morna, slipping  through gloomy woods, keeping away from habitations, getting by desolate  and lonely ways to her lord in Kerry.    Perhaps it was he that was afraid of the sons of Morna, and perhaps she  loved him.        CHAPTER III    THE women druids, his guardians, belonged to his father's people.  Bovmall was Uail's sister, and, consequently, Fionn's aunt. Only such  a blood-tie could have bound them to the clann-Baiscne, for it is not  easy, having moved in the world of court and camp, to go hide with a  baby in a wood; and to live, as they must have lived, in terror.    What stories they would have told the child of the sons of Morna. Of  Morna himself, the huge-shouldered, stern-eyed, violent Connachtman; and  of his sons--young Goll Mor mac Morna in particular, as huge-shouldered  as his father, as fierce in the onset, but merry-eyed when the other  was grim, and bubbling with a laughter that made men forgive even his  butcheries. Of Cona'n Mael mac Morna his brother, gruff as a badger,  bearded like a boar, bald as a crow, and with a tongue that could manage  an insult where another man would not find even a stammer. His boast was  that when he saw an open door he went into it, and when he saw a closed  door he went into it. When he saw a peaceful man he insulted him, and  when he met a man who was not peaceful he insulted him. There was Garra  Duv mac Morna, and savage Art Og, who cared as little for their own  skins as they did for the next man's, and Garra must have been rough  indeed to have earned in that clan the name of the Rough mac Morna.  There were others: wild Connachtmen all, as untameable, as unaccountable  as their own wonderful countryside.    Fionn would have heard much of them, and it is likely that he practised  on a nettle at taking the head off Goll, and that he hunted a sheep  from cover in the implacable manner he intended later on for Cona'n the  Swearer.    But it is of Uail mac Baiscne he would have heard most. With what a  dilation of spirit the ladies would have told tales of him, Fionn's  father. How their voices would have become a chant as feat was added  to feat, glory piled on glory. The most famous of men and the most  beautiful; the hardest fighter; the easiest giver; the kingly champion;  the chief of the Fianna na h-Eirinn. Tales of how he had been way-laid  and got free; of how he had been generous and got free; of how he had  been angry and went marching with the speed of an eagle and the direct  onfall of a storm; while in front and at the sides, angled from the prow  of his terrific advance, were fleeing multitudes who did not dare to  wait and scarce had time to run. And of how at last, when the time  came to quell him, nothing less than the whole might of Ireland was  sufficient for that great downfall.    We may be sure that on these adventures Fionn was with his father, going  step for step with the long-striding hero, and heartening him mightily.        CHAPTER IV    He was given good training by the women in running and leaping and  swimming.    One of them would take a thorn switch in her hand, and Fionn would  take a thorn switch in his hand, and each would try to strike the other  running round a tree.    You had to go fast to keep away from the switch behind, and a small boy  feels a switch. Fionn would run his best to get away from that prickly  stinger, but how he would run when it was his turn to deal the strokes!    With reason too, for his nurses had suddenly grown implacable. They  pursued him with a savagery which he could not distinguish from hatred,  and they swished him well whenever they got the chance.    Fionn learned to run. After a while he could buzz around a tree like  a maddened fly, and oh, the joy, when he felt himself drawing from the  switch and gaining from behind on its bearer! How he strained and panted  to catch on that pursuing person and pursue her and get his own switch  into action.    He learned to jump by chasing hares in a bumpy field. Up went the hare  and up went Fionn, and away with the two of them, hopping and popping  across the field. If the hare turned while Fionn was after her it was  switch for Fionn; so that in a while it did not matter to Fionn which  way the hare jumped for he could jump that way too. Long-ways, sideways  or baw-ways, Fionn hopped where the hare hopped, and at last he was the  owner of a hop that any hare would give an ear for.    He was taught to swim, and it may be that his heart sank when he fronted  the lesson. The water was cold. It was deep. One could see the bottom,  leagues below, millions of miles below. A small boy might shiver as he  stared into that wink and blink and twink of brown pebbles and murder.  And these implacable women threw him in!    Perhaps he would not go in at first. He may have smiled at them, and  coaxed, and hung back. It was a leg and an arm gripped then; a swing for  Fionn, and out and away with him; plop and flop for him; down into chill  deep death for him, and up with a splutter; with a sob; with a grasp  at everything that caught nothing; with a wild flurry; with a raging  despair; with a bubble and snort as he was hauled again down, and down,  and down, and found as suddenly that he had been hauled out.    Fionn learned to swim until he could pop into the water like an otter  and slide through it like an eel.    He used to try to chase a fish the way he chased hares in the bumpy  field--but there are terrible spurts in a fish. It may be that a fish  cannot hop, but he gets there in a flash, and he isn't there in another.  Up or down, sideways or endways, it is all one to a fish. He goes and  is gone. He twists this way and disappears the other way. He is over  you when he ought to be under you, and he is biting your toe when you  thought you were biting his tail.    You cannot catch a fish by swimming, but you can try, and Fionn tried.  He got a grudging commendation from the terrible women when he was able  to slip noiselessly in the tide, swim under water to where a wild duck  was floating and grip it by the leg.    \"Qu--,\" said the duck, and he disappeared before he had time to get the  \"-ack\" out of him.    So the time went, and Fionn grew long and straight and tough like a  sapling; limber as a willow, and with the flirt and spring of a young  bird. One of the ladies may have said, \"He is shaping very well, my  dear,\" and the other replied, as is the morose privilege of an aunt,  \"He will never be as good as his father,\" but their hearts must have  overflowed in the night, in the silence, in the darkness, when they  thought of the living swiftness they had fashioned, and that dear fair  head.        CHAPTER V    ONE day his guardians were agitated: they held confabulations at which  Fionn was not permitted to assist. A man who passed by in the morning  had spoken to them. They fed the man, and during his feeding Fionn had  been shooed from the door as if he were a chicken. When the stranger  took his road the women went with him a short distance. As they passed  the man lifted a hand and bent a knee to Fionn.    \"My soul to you, young master,\" he said, and as he said it, Fionn  knew that he could have the man's soul, or his boots, or his feet, or  anything that belonged to him.    When the women returned they were mysterious and whispery. They chased  Fionn into the house, and when they got him in they chased him out  again. They chased each other around the house for another whisper. They  calculated things by the shape of clouds, by lengths of shadows, by the  flight of birds, by two flies racing on a flat stone, by throwing bones  over their left shoulders, and by every kind of trick and game and  chance that you could put a mind to.    They told Fionn he must sleep in a tree that night, and they put him  under bonds not to sing or whistle or cough or sneeze until the morning.    Fionn did sneeze. He never sneezed so much in his life. He sat up in his  tree and nearly sneezed himself out of it. Flies got up his nose, two  at a time, one up each nose, and his head nearly fell off the way he  sneezed.    \"You are doing that on purpose,\" said a savage whisper from the foot of  the tree.    But Fionn was not doing it on purpose. He tucked himself into a fork the  way he had been taught, and he passed the crawliest, tickliest night he  had ever known. After a while he did not want to sneeze, he wanted to  scream: and in particular he wanted to come down from the tree. But he  did not scream, nor did he leave the tree. His word was passed, and he  stayed in his tree as silent as a mouse and as watchful, until he fell  out of it.

The Commissioner his Grace protested that the Assemblies _approving these  books, or any thing contained in them_ be no wayes prejudicial to his  Majestie, nor to the Archbishops, and Bishops of this Kingdome, or any of  their adherents; because he had some exceptions against these books. My  Lord _Rothes_ desired these exceptions to be condescended on, and they  should be preferably cleared, and protested that these books should be  claimed authentick and obligatorie hereafter.    The whole Assembly all in one voice approved these books, and ordained the  same to make faith in judgement, and out with, in all time commitit, as  the true and authentick Registers of the Kirk of Scotland, conform to the  testimonie subscribed by the Committie, to be insert with the reasons  thereof in the books of Assembly: Whereof the tenour followeth.    We under-subscribers, having power and commission from the generall  Assembly now presently convened, and sitting at _Glasgow_, to peruse,  examine and cognosce upon the validity, faith and strength of the books  and registers of the Assembly under-written, to wit: A register beginning  at the Assembly holden the twentie day of _December_ 1566. and ending at  the fourth session of the Assembly held in the 28 of _December_ 1566.    Item another register beginning at the generall Assembly, holden the  second day of June 1567. and ending at the fourth session of the Assembly  holden at _Perth_ the ninth day of _August_ 1572, which register is  imperfect, and mutilate in the end, and containeth are no leaf nor page  after that page which containeth the said inscription of the said fourth  session, which two registers bears to be subscribed by _John Gray_ scribe.    Item a register of the Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_ the seventh day of  _August_ 1574, and ending with the twelfth session, being the last session  of the Assembly 1579.    Item another register beginning at the Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_ the  tenth of _May_ 1586. and ending in the seventeenth session of the Assembly  holden in _March_, 1589.    Item another register being the fifth book, and greatest volume, beginning  at the Assembly holden in _Anno_ 1560, and ending in the year 1590.    Having carefully viewed, perused and considered the first registers, and  every one of them, and being deeply and maturely advised, as in a matter  of greatest weight and consequence, do attest before God, and upon our  conscience declare to the world and this present Assembly, that the saids  foure registers above expressed, and every one of them, are famous,  authentick and good registers: which ought to be so reputed and have  publick faith in judgement and out with ad validem it the records in all  things, and that the said fifth & greatest book, beginning at the Assembly  1560. and ending 1590. being by the hand writs of the Clerk, cognosced,  and tryed, and agreeable to the other four registers, in what is extant in  them, ought be free of all prejudice and suspicion, and received with  them. And in testimonie of our solemne affirmation, we have made these  presents with our hands.    Subscribitur,  Master Andrew Ramsay.  Master John Adamson.  Master John Row.  Master Rohre Murray.  Master Alexander Gibson.  Master James Boner.  Master Alexander Peerson.  Master Alexander Wedderburn.    _Reasons prooving the five Books and Registers produced before the  Assembly to be authentick_.    The books now exhibited unto us underscribers, which we have revised and  perused by commission from the generall Assembly, are true registers of  the Kirk: to wit, Five Volumes, whereof the first two contain the acts of  the Assembly, from the year of God 1560. to the year 1572. all subscribed  by _John Gray_ Clerk. The third from the year of God 1574. to the year  1579. The fourth from the year of God 1586. to the year 1589. At which  time _Master James Richie_ was Clerk, who hath frequently written upon the  margine of the saids two last books, and subscribed the said margine with  his hand-writing. And the fifth book being the greatest Volume, containing  the acts of the generall Assembly, from the year of God 1560. to the year  1590. which agreeth with the foresaids other foure books and registers, in  so far as is extant in them, and further recordeth, what is wanting by  them, passing by what is mutilate in them, and which with the two Volumes  produced by _Master Thomas Sandilands_ from the year 1590. to this  present, maketh up a perfect register.    I. For the first two Volumes subscribed by _Ionn Gray_, albeit it be not  necessar in such antiquietie to proove that he was Clerk, seeing he  designes himself so by his subscription, yet the same is manifest by an  act mentioned in the third book, in the time of _Master James Richie_, who  succeeded him in the said office, and his hand-writ was acknowledged by  sundry old men in the ministery.    II. The uniformitie of his subscriptions through both Volumes, evident by  ocular inspection above the ordinarie custome of most famous Notars,  delivers the same from all suspicion _in facto tam antiquo_.    III. There be many coppies, specially of general acts, yet extant, which  do not debord from the saids registers, but are altogether agreeable  thereto.    IV. It is constant by the universal custome of this Kingdome, that all  registers are transmitted from one keeper to his successour; and so  comming by progresse and succession from the first incumbent to the last  possessour, are never doubted to be the registers of that judicatorie,  whereof the last haver was Clerk; and therefore it is evident, that these  books comming successfulie from _John Gray_, _Master James Richie_, and  _Master Thomas Nicolson_, who were all Clerks to the Assembly, into the  hands of _Master Robert Winrame_, who was constitute Clerk depute by the  said _Master Robert Nicolson_ (as his deputation here present to show,  will testifie) are the undoubted registers of the Assembly: like as  _Alexander Blair_ succeeded the said _Master Robert_ in his place of  Clerkship to the assignations and modifications of Ministers stipends; and  during _Master Robert_ his life-time, was his actual servant, and so had  the said books by progresse from him, which the said _Alexander_'s readie  presently to testifie.    V. The two registers of _Master James Richie_, albeit not under his own  hand, yet are frequently margined with his own hand-writ, and the same  marginal additions subscribed by him, which hand-writ is seen and  cognosced by famous men, who knoweth the same, and it is evident, being  compared with his several writings and subscriptions yet extant.    VI. The said registers are more perfect, lesse vitiated, scored, and  interlined, then any other authentick and famous registers of the most  prime judicatories within this Kingdom:    VII. _Master Thomas Sandilands_, in name of his father, who was late Clerk  by dimution of _Master Thomas Nicolson_, hath produced a Volume, which  proveth the saids two registers of _Master James Richie_ to be sufficient  records; because that same Volume is begun by that same hand, whereby the  said _Master James Richie_ his registers are written, and is subscribed  once in the margine by _Master James Richie_ his hand, and followed forth,  and continued in the same book by _Master Thomas Nicolson_, who succeeded  him in the place, and was known by most men here present to be of such  approven worth and credit, that he would never have accomplished a  register which had not been famous and true: and whereof the hand-write,  had not then been known to him sufficiently.    VIII. That register produced by _Master Thomas Sandilands_, and prosecuted  by _Master Thomas Nicolson_, proves the first part of that register to be  true and famous, and that first part being by ocular inspection of the  same hand writ, with _Master James Richies_ registers, and subscribed in  the margine with the same hand writ, proveth _Richies_ two books to be  good records, and _Richies_ registers doth approve _Grays_ books by the  act of Assembly before written: specially considering the same hath come  by progresse and succession of Clerks, in the hands of _Alexander Blair_,  now living, and here present.    IX. The compts anent the thirds of benefices between the Regent for the  time, and the Assembly, in the second volume, pag. 147. are subscribed by  the Lord Regents own hand, as appeareth: for it is a royall-like  subscription, and there is no hand writ in all the book like unto it, and  beareth not _Sic subscribitur_, which undoubtedly it would do, if it were  a coppie.    X. _Master Iames Carmichell_ was commanded by the generall Assembly 1595,  Sess. 9, in the book produced by _Master Thomas Sandilands_, to extract  the generall acts forth of their books; and it is evident that these books  are the same which he perused for that effect, because he hath marked  therein the generall acts with a crosse, and hath designed the act by some  short expression upon the margine, which is cognosed and known to be his  hand writ, by famous and worthy persons: which is also manifest by the  said _Master James_ his hand and subscription, written with his own hand  in the last leafe of the said books; as also acknowledged in the said  book, produced by _Master Thomas Sandilands_, wherein the said _Master  James Carmichell_ granteth the receipt of these, with some other books of  the Assemblies.    XI. The registers produced, are the registers of the Assembly, because in  _Anno_ 1586, the Assembly complaineth that their registers are mutilate:  which hath relation to _Richies_ third book, which is lacerat and mutilate  in divers places without any interveening of blank paper, or any mention  of _hic deese_.
