SW Sabinas), 1000 ft., August 22, 1949.    Swainson's Hawk is not common in Coahuila. The size of the testes (6x4  mm.) of No. 32022, the adult plumage, and the date (June 20) on which  it was obtained suggest that it was a breeding bird. Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1950:55) reported that this species breeds as far  east as Durango and Chihuahua. Findley saw a Swainson's Hawk 2 mi. S  and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952.    **_Buteo albonotatus Kaup._--The Zone-tailed Hawk is uncommon in  Coahuila. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:26) noted the species \"a few miles  west of Saltillo ... on January 30.\"    _Buteo regalis_ (Gray).--The Ferruginous Hawk is uncommon in Coahuila.  Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:26) noted a single bird \"not far from  Parras, on January 30.\"    _Buteo nitidus_ (Latham).--Evenden (1952:112) saw a Gray Hawk one mile  northeast of Saltillo, at Ramos Arizpe on March 4. Although there are  no other records of the Gray Hawk from Coahuila, its occurrence in the  State would be expected because this species has been recorded from  Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico (Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore, 1950:57).    **_Parabuteo unicinctus harrisi_ (Audubon).--Harris' Hawk is fairly  common in southern Coahuila. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:26) stated that  Harris' Hawk \"was one of the few birds noted repeatedly in ... southern  Coahuila....\"    _Circus cyaneus_ (Linnaeus).--The Marsh Hawk is a common migrant and  winter visitant in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:161) remarked that the Marsh  Hawk was \"seen in northward migratory flight across the desert east of  the Sierra del Carmen on March 31 and on April 11 along the west face  of Loomis Peak at 8800 feet.\" Olmstead saw a female Marsh Hawk 1 mi. W  San Buenaventura on April 2, 1952. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:188) noted  the Marsh Hawk \"about Saltillo\" and \"above the summit of Diamante Pass  at about 8,000 feet\" on April 14. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:26) noted  wintering Marsh Hawks \"near San Pedro.\"    _Pandion haliaetus_ (Linnaeus).--Miller (1955a:161) reported seeing an  Osprey on April 9 in Corte Madera Canyon, \"apparently in migration;\"  this is the only record from Coahuila.    **_Caracara cheriway_ (Jacquin).--From the few records in the  literature, I judge that the Caracara is uncommon in Coahuila. Evenden  (1952:113) saw three Caracaras \"south of Saltillo\" on March 5. Baker  saw a Caracara in the Sierra del Pino (=6 mi. NW Tanque Alvarez), 3400  feet, on July 6, 1953. No specimens of the Caracara have been taken  from Coahuila.    _Falco mexicanus_ Schlegel.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male] 31596,  from Saltillo, January 10, 1954.    The Prairie Falcon is an uncommon winter visitant in Coahuila.  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1950:65) indicated that _Falco  mexicanus_ winters south to Sonora, Oaxaca, Chihuahua, Durango,  Zacatecas, Auguascalientes, Hidalgo, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas.    No. 31596 is the first recorded specimen of the Prairie Falcon from  Coahuila. The bird was heavily parasitized by worms in the mesenteries  and seems to be an adult. Although its nuchal collar, as in immatures,  is washed with pale cinnamon-buff, its thighs are not heavily marked  with dark brown spots. The superciliary lines have blackish rather than  brownish streaks, and the scapulars do not have four or five dark bars  (Friedmann, 1950:624).    _Falco columbarius bendirei_ Swann.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male]  31634, from Don Martin Dam (=Rio Salado), November 27, 1953,  measurements: wing, 191 mm.; tail, 111 mm.; tarsus, 37 mm.; culmen, 12  mm.; testes, 3x1 mm.    The Pigeon Hawk seems to be uncommon in Coahuila. No. 31634, the first  record of this species in Coahuila, has pale gray interspaces on the  rectrices of its tail that are definitely wider than the three black  bands, indicating affinity with _bendirei_ (Friedmann, 1950:702). Our  bird was obtained near the base of the Don Martin Dam of the Rio  Salado, and was observed hunting dragonflies over the water.    _Falco sparverius sparverius_ Linnaeus.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31648, from the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5 mi.  W General Cepeda), 6400 ft., April 17, 1953, weight, 104 gms.    The Sparrow Hawk is locally common in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:162)  noted the species occasionally in the lower canyon areas of the Sierra  del Carmen at 5000 feet from April 20 to 28. Dickerman saw two Sparrow  Hawks in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:27) took a male at La Rosa on January 30 that was typical for  _F. s. sparverius_. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:188) noted Sparrow Hawks  almost daily about Saltillo and infrequently in the open valley south  of Diamante Pass; they took a female at Saltillo on April 22 that was  assigned to _F. s. sparverius_.    *_Colinus virginianus texanus_ (Lawrence).--_Specimens examined:_ total  9: [Male] 29408 and [Female] 29409 from 1 mi. S, 9 mi. W Villa Acuna,  April 2, 1950, weights, 169.5 and 174.7 gms., [Male] 29410 and [Female]  [Female] 29411-29413 from 3 mi. W, 1 mi. S San Geronimo, April 9, 1950,  weights, 152.6, 158.6, 158.2, 159.0, and 152.8 gms.; and [Male] [Male]  32032-32034 from 9 mi. S, 11 mi. E Sabinas, 1050 ft., June 13 and 14,  1952.    The Bobwhite is locally common in northeastern Coahuila. Aldrich and  Duvall (1955:18) indicated that _C. v. texanus_ has been recorded from  two separate localities in northeastern Coahuila and from several  localities in Texas along the Rio Grande. Findley saw Bobwhites 2 mi. S  and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952. The specimens of  Bobwhite from 3 mi. W and 1 mi. S San Geronimo seem to extend the known  range of _texanus_ nearly 100 miles west. The sizes of the testes (11,  16, 15, 15 mm.) of Nos. 29408, 32032-32034, respectively, indicates  breeding by the Bobwhite in Coahuila.    *_Callipepla squamata pallida_ Brewster.--_Specimens examined:_ total  16: [Male] 29414 from 1 mi. S, 13 mi. W Villa Acuna, April 4, 1950;  [Male] [Male] 29415-29417 from 11 mi. W Hacienda San Miguel, 2200 ft.,  April 4, 1950, weights, 205.3, 198.6, and 182.7 gms.; [Female] [Female]  31019-31021 from 10 mi. S, 5 mi. E Boquillas, 1500 ft., March 2 and 4,  1952, weights, 184.4, 180 and 154.2 gms.; [Male] 34454 from 2 mi. SSE  Castillon, 4050 ft., June 29, 1953, weight, 169 gms.; [Male] 29418 and  [Female] 29419 from 8 mi. N, 2 mi. E La Babia, April 8, 1950; [Male]  [Male] 32023-32024, [Male] 32026, [Female] 32025, and [Female] 32027  from 5 mi. N, 19 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas, 3250 ft., July 6, 1952; and  [Male] 32640 from 2 mi. W Paila, July 3, 1955.    The Scaled Quail is common in Coahuila. The subspecies _pallida_ occurs  in northwestern Coahuila south to Sierra de los Alamitos. Intergrades  of _pallida_, _castanogastris_, and _squamata_ are present in the  central part of the State. No. 32640, obtained 2 mi. W Paila, has some  resemblance to _squamata_. Five specimens of _pallida_ from the central  part of Coahuila (5 mi. N and 19 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas), show little or  no approach toward _squamata_. Miller (1955a:162) stated that two of  the Scaled Quail collected in the Sierra del Carmen show no approach to  the race _castanogastris_ of eastern Coahuila nor to _C. s. squamata_  of southern Coahuila. From the specimens that I have examined, I judge  that the range of _pallida_ extends as far south as the Sierra de los  Alamitos rather than only to the northwestern part of Coahuila as  reported by Aldrich and Duvall (1955:17). In northeastern Coahuila  _pallida_ seems to intergrade with _castanogastris_; No. 29414 has an  indistinct rusty chestnut patch on its abdomen, thus resembling  _castanogastris_.    The sizes of the testes (9-12 mm.) and of the largest ova (14 mm. in  diameter and an egg 23 mm. long) of birds labeled with reference to  Cuatro Cienegas indicate breeding activity.    **_Callipepla squamata castanogastris_ Brewster.--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Male] 32028, from 9 mi. S, 11 mi. E Sabinas, June 14, 1952.    Typical representatives of _C. s. castanogastris_ in Coahuila occur  only in the extreme northeastern section of the State, and most  specimens of the Scaled Quail from northeastern Coahuila are  intergrades between _pallida_ and _castanogastris_.    No. 32028 is identified as _C. s. castanogastris_ because there is a  distinct rusty chestnut patch on its abdomen. This patch, nevertheless,  is not so large as in a more nearly typical male _C. s. castanogastris_  from 15 mi. NNW Anahuac, Nuevo Leon.    **_Callipepla squamata squamata_ (Vigors).--_Specimens examined:_ total  2: [Male] 30231 and [Female] 30232 from 10 mi. NW San Lorenzo, 4200  ft., February 3, 1951.    The subspecies _squamata_ occurs in southern Coahuila. Amadon and  Phillips (1947:577) took a Scaled Quail at Las Delicias on August 18  that \"was only two-thirds grown, though well able to fly\" and obtained  an adult 19 mi. W Saltillo that was typical _squamata_. Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:188) stated that _C. s. squamata_ was one of the  characteristic birds of the open desert country of southeastern  Coahuila. Scaled Quail were seen by Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._)  \"about Saltillo and in the open valley south of Diamante Pass.\"    The breast and upper back of both specimens from 10 mi. NW San Lorenzo,  are plumbeous-gray rather than pale dull gray. Also the lower back,  rump, abdomen, forehead, and crown more closely resemble the subspecies  _squamata_ rather than _C. s. pallida_. However, the upper backs of  both specimens are not so plumbeous-gray as on a male (32030) and a  female (32031) of the subspecies _squamata_ from 1 mi. N Chorro,  Durango, 6450 ft., July 11, 1952. The two birds from Durango appear to  be slightly darker than the Coahuilan specimens that approach the  subspecies _pallida_.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:188-189) stated that one of their specimens  of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26113"],[0,"Handbook of Wool Knitting and Crochet (#5)"],[1,"the thumb is started at right of the  stripe, on the right-hand glove at the left of stripe. Begin thumb with  widen, knit 1, widen; knit 3 rows as usual, then widen, knit 3, widen;  continue in this way until you have widened the thumb to 17 stitches.  Put these on 2 needles, on a 3d needle cast on 7 stitches, join and knit  once around, in each of next 3 rounds narrow 1 of the 7 stitches,  arrange the stitches evenly on 3 needles, knit two inches, then narrow  at end of each needle until you have 6 remaining, put these on 2 needles  and bind off.    Continuing with the hand, pick up the 7 stitches cast on at base of  thumb, knit to the base of the little finger, and divide the stitches on  2 needles, or, if more convenient, take them off on a twine. For the  little finger: Take 8 stitches from back needle and 8 from front, and  cast on 6 stitches, knit once around plain, narrow off 1 of the 6  stitches in each of next 5 rounds, knit 2 inches, narrow 1 stitch at end  of each needle until 6 stitches remain, put these on 2 needles and bind  off.    First Finger: Pick up the 6 stitches cast on for little finger, knit to  the middle, take 8 stitches from each side next the thumb, cast on 6  stitches for inside of finger, knit once around plain, in next 4 rounds  narrow off 1 of the 6 stitches, knit two and one-half inches, and finish  off as before.    Third Finger: Pick up the 6 stitches cast on for first finger, knit  them, knit plain, leaving 9 stitches toward little finger, putting these  on separate needle, 9 stitches from other side, cast on 6 stitches, knit  until you get to those left for little finger, narrow 1 of these and 1  of the 6 each time around for 6 rounds, knit two and one-half inches,  and finish off as directed.    Middle Finger: Pick up the 6 from last finger, knit around plain,  proceed as directed for third finger, knit two and three-fourths inches  plain and finish off.          Knitted Slippers with Ermine Trimming      [Illustration: Knitted Bedroom-Slippers with Ermine Trimming]    Materials required are three skeins fourfold Germantown yarn, two  colors, and one yard of ribbon. Pink and white yarn, with a little  black, and pink ribbon are used for the slippers illustrated.    Cast on 15 stitches with white yarn, using medium-size steel needles.  Knit back and forth until you have a perfect square of white, then join  the color. The square is for the toe of slipper.    Knit back and forth on the 15 stitches until you have a strip long  enough to extend around the sole of slipper and join to the square on  other side, leaving two sides and one corner for the toe.    Darn the white with black; beginning at lower right-hand corner, bring  the needle through the first two ribs and down between next two, miss  three ribs, keeping the long thread on the wrong side, and repeat,  having every other row alternate. This may be done before the strip is  joined to opposite side of square, if more convenient. Sew to the sole,  using strong thread and over-and-over stitches. The strip should be  stretched somewhat during the sewing, in order to make the slipper cling  well to the foot.    For the border: Cast on 10 stitches with white and knit plain, back and  forth, until the strip is long enough to go around the top. Darn with  the black yarn, making three rows, over one rib and under three,  alternating the stitches. Sew to top of slipper, turn back, and put on  the bows.    These slippers are very easily knitted, extremely pretty and may be made  to fit any size of sole. For a larger slipper cast on an additional  number of stitches for the square, which will make the strip  proportionally wider; knit it long enough for the larger sole, and make  the border wider, if desired. A smaller slipper is begun with less  stitches, following the same general directions.          Babies' Long Bootees      [Illustration: Babies' Long Bootees]    Two colors of Saxony, blue and white or pink and white, and two steel  knitting-needles, No. 14, are required for these bootees.    With color, cast on 57 stitches.    1. Knit plain.    2. With white, knit 4, over, knit 3, * slip, narrow and bind, knit 3,  over, knit 1, over, knit 3; repeat from * to end of row.    3. Purl.    Repeat last 2 rows three times; with color knit 2 rows; with white  repeat 2d and 3d rows twice, and again knit 2 rows plain with color and  2 rows plain with white.    With white knit 14 rows of single rib (knit 1, purl 1).    With color knit 2 rows plain; then with white knit 8 rows in single rib;  repeat the last 10 rows, and again knit 2 rows plain, with color.    With white knit 1 row, purl 1 row, alternately, for 4 rows; this gives  the appearance of plain knitting on the right side.    Make a row of spaces in which to run ribbon, thus: Knit 2, * over 3  times, narrow, knit 1; repeat from * to end of row. Purl back, dropping  2 of the \"overs.\"    Again knit forward and purl back for 5 rows; then knit 15 rows in single  rib, completing the leg.    For the instep: Slip 1st 18 stitches on to the needle, join in the  color, knit 21 stitches, turn and knit back. With white knit 1 row and  purl 1 row, alternately, for 6 rows. Repeat last 8 rows three times,  which will give four white stripes and the same of narrow ones, in  color; again knit forward and back with color.    For the slipper or foot, using color, knit off 18 stitches on right-hand  needle, pick up and knit 17 stitches along the side of instep, knit 21  across instep, pick up 17 on other side and knit the 18 stitches on left  needle. Knit back and forth plain for 20 rows and bind off. Sew up the  foot and back of leg, and draw ribbon through the spaces.    These bootees come up well to the knee, and are warm as well as pretty.  The ribbed portions cause them to fit snugly, so they are not likely to  slip down and off the little feet.          Child's Knitted Mittens      [Illustration: Child's Knitted Mittens]    Use Saxony yarn with needles of suitable size, as you knit tight or  loose. No. 17 is a good average size. Cast 18 stitches on each of three  needles.    Knit 2, purl 1; repeat, until the wrist is of length desired, say two  inches.    For the pattern, knit as follows:    1. Purl.    2, 3, 4. Knit 2, purl 1.    These 4 rows are repeated throughout.    Begin to widen for the thumb in the 2d row above the wrist; to widen  pick up a stitch between needles and knit it, knit 1, widen, and  continue in pattern. Knit 2 rows, in pattern, and again widen, knit 3,  widen, across base of thumb. Continue in this way, adding 2 stitches  between the widenings every 3d row, and keeping as closely as possible  to the pattern, until you have 21 stitches across the thumb. Knit around  twice in pattern and take the thumb-stitches off on a strong thread.    Knit around in pattern, and when you come to the thumb cast on 7  stitches, or one third the number widened for the thumb. Continue  knitting the hand to the tip of the little finger, then commence  narrowing. The manner in which this is done depends on the shape of the  hand to be fitted. For an ordinary mitten, narrow every 5th stitch, and  knit 5 times around; then narrow every 4th stitch and knit 4 times  around; every 3d stitch and knit 3 times around; every 2d stitch and  knit twice around; then narrow, knit 1, repeat around, knit once around,  narrow every stitch, draw yarn through, and darn the end neatly and  securely. It is an excellent plan to \"run\" the tip of a mitten on the  wrong side, as you do the heel of a stocking, since it makes it wear  longer, especially if intended for rough usage. The narrowing of a  child's mitten may begin with every 4th stitch. Also, if the hand is  long and slender, an additional row may be knitted between the widenings  for the thumb.    Take the stitches off the thread on 2 needles, and with the 3d pick up  and knit the stitches across the hand, which were cast on. When knitting  around the first time, narrow once each end of the picked-up stitches.    Even the stitches on the needles, and knit around in pattern until you  reach the base of the nail, then narrow off, beginning with once in 3  stitches. Draw through the last stitches at tip and darn down.          Knee-Cap      [Illustration: Knee-Cap]    Elderly people, or those at all inclined to rheumatic twinges,  appreciate the knee-cap, and a pair of them will make a most acceptable  gift to grandpa or grandma. No. 12 steel needles and Germantown yarn  were used for the model, which may be made more or less heavy, as  desired, by choosing coarser or finer yarn.    Cast 35 stitches upon each of three needles and knit around 30 times in  single rib--that is, knit 1, purl 1, alternately. You are now ready to  begin the gore, which may be done in single rib, like the rest, or in  basket-stitch (or other fancy pattern) as in the model.    Take 26 stitches on one needle, leaving all other stitches idle; take a  stitch from each side every time across until but 42 stitches are left  on both idle needles. Narrow at the end of the busy needle each time  until but 26 stitches are left on the busy needle. Take up 23 stitches  on the selvage at each side, divide the stitches evenly on the three  needles, and you should have the original number of 35 stitches on each  of the needles. Again knit 30 rows in single rib, bind off loosely, and  finish with a simple crocheted border of chain-loops or shells caught  down in every other stitch.    To knit the gore in basket-stitch, * purl 6, knit 2; repeat for 3 rows,  then knit 1 row plain; repeat 1st 3 rows, placing the 2 plain stitches  exactly in the center of the 6 purled stitches of previous rows. This  change, made after each plain row, gives the woven- or basket-effect,  and the pattern is a very pretty one for sweaters.
