[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#5)"],[1,"of the American hotel is commonly the same, and,  as I have said, it is a very sound one so far as it goes. When I first  went into one of the big New York hotels, the first impression was  certainly its bigness. It was called the Biltmore; and I wondered how  many national humorists had made the obvious comment of wishing they had  built less. But it was not merely the Babylonian size and scale of such  things, it was the way in which they are used. They are used almost as  public streets, or rather as public squares. My first impression was  that I was in some sort of high street or market-place during a carnival  or a revolution. True, the people looked rather rich for a revolution  and rather grave for a carnival; but they were congested in great crowds  that moved slowly like people passing through an overcrowded railway  station. Even in the dizzy heights of such a sky-scraper there could not  possibly be room for all those people to sleep in the hotel, or even to  dine in it. And, as a matter of fact, they did nothing whatever except  drift into it and drift out again. Most of them had no more to do with  the hotel than I have with Buckingham Palace. I have never been in  Buckingham Palace, and I have very seldom, thank God, been in the big  hotels of this type that exist in London or Paris. But I cannot believe  that mobs are perpetually pouring through the Hotel Cecil or the Savoy  in this fashion, calmly coming in at one door and going out of the  other. But this fact is part of the fundamental structure of the  American hotel; it is built upon a compromise that makes it possible.  The whole of the lower floor is thrown open to the public streets and  treated as a public square. But above it and all round it runs another  floor in the form of a sort of deep gallery, furnished more luxuriously  and looking down on the moving mobs beneath. No one is allowed on this  floor except the guests or clients of the hotel. As I have been one of  them myself, I trust it is not unsympathetic to compare them to active  anthropoids who can climb trees, and so look down in safety on the herds  or packs of wilder animals wandering and prowling below. Of course there  are modifications of this architectural plan, but they are generally  approximations to it; it is the plan that seems to suit the social life  of the American cities. There is generally something like a ground floor  that is more public, a half-floor or gallery above that is more private,  and above that the bulk of the block of bedrooms, the huge hive with its  innumerable and identical cells.    The ladder of ascent in this tower is of course the lift, or, as it is  called, the elevator. With all that we hear of American hustle and  hurry it is rather strange that Americans seem to like more than we do  to linger upon long words. And indeed there is an element of delay in  their diction and spirit, very little understood, which I may discuss  elsewhere. Anyhow they say elevator when we say lift, just as they say  automobile when we say motor and stenographer when we say typist, or  sometimes (by a slight confusion) typewriter. Which reminds me of  another story that never existed, about a man who was accused of having  murdered and dismembered his secretary when he had only taken his typing  machine to pieces; but we must not dwell on these digressions. The  Americans may have another reason for giving long and ceremonious titles  to the lift. When first I came among them I had a suspicion that they  possessed and practised a new and secret religion, which was the cult of  the elevator. I fancied they worshipped the lift, or at any rate  worshipped in the lift. The details or data of this suspicion it were  now vain to collect, as I have regretfully abandoned it, except in so  far as they illustrate the social principles underlying the structural  plan of the building. Now an American gentleman invariably takes off his  hat in the lift. He does not take off his hat in the hotel, even if it  is crowded with ladies. But he always so salutes a lady in the elevator;  and this marks the difference of atmosphere. The lift is a room, but the  hotel is a street. But during my first delusion, of course, I assumed  that he uncovered in this tiny temple merely because he was in church.  There is something about the very word elevator that expresses a great  deal of his vague but idealistic religion. Perhaps that flying chapel  will eventually be ritualistically decorated like a chapel; possibly  with a symbolic scheme of wings. Perhaps a brief religious service will  be held in the elevator as it ascends; in a few well-chosen words  touching the Utmost for the Highest. Possibly he would consent even to  call the elevator a lift, if he could call it an uplift. There would be  no difficulty, except what I cannot but regard as the chief moral  problem of all optimistic modernism. I mean the difficulty of imagining  a lift which is free to go up, if it is not also free to go down.    I think I know my American friends and acquaintances too well to  apologise for any levity in these illustrations. Americans make fun of  their own institutions; and their own journalism is full of such  fanciful conjectures. The tall building is itself artistically akin to  the tall story. The very word sky-scraper is an admirable example of an  American lie. But I can testify quite as eagerly to the solid and  sensible advantages of the symmetrical hotel. It is not only a pattern  of vases and stuffed flamingoes; it is also an equally accurate pattern  of cupboards and baths. It is a dignified and humane custom to have a  bathroom attached to every bedroom; and my impulse to sing the praises  of it brought me once at least into a rather quaint complication. I  think it was in the city of Dayton; anyhow I remember there was a  Laundry Convention going on in the same hotel, in a room very  patriotically and properly festooned with the stars and stripes, and  doubtless full of promise for the future of laundering. I was  interviewed on the roof, within earshot of this debate, and may have  been the victim of some association or confusion; anyhow, after  answering the usual questions about Labour, the League of Nations, the  length of ladies' dresses, and other great matters, I took refuge in a  rhapsody of warm and well-deserved praise of American bathrooms. The  editor, I understand, running a gloomy eye down the column of his  contributor's 'story,' and seeing nothing but metaphysical terms such as  justice, freedom, the abstract disapproval of sweating, swindling, and  the like, paused at last upon the ablutionary allusion, and his eye  brightened. 'That's the only copy in the whole thing,' he said, 'A  Bath-Tub in Every Home.' So these words appeared in enormous letters  above my portrait in the paper. It will be noted that, like many things  that practical men make a great point of, they miss the point. What I  had commended as new and national was a bathroom in every bedroom. Even  feudal and moss-grown England is not entirely ignorant of an occasional  bath-tub in the home. But what gave me great joy was what followed. I  discovered with delight that many people, glancing rapidly at my  portrait with its prodigious legend, imagined that it was a commercial  advertisement, and that I was a very self-advertising commercial  traveller. When I walked about the streets, I was supposed to be  travelling in bath-tubs. Consider the caption of the portrait, and you  will see how similar it is to the true commercial slogan: 'We offer a  Bath-Tub in Every Home.' And this charming error was doubtless clinched  by the fact that I had been found haunting the outer courts of the  temple of the ancient Guild of Lavenders. I never knew how many shared  the impression; I regret to say that I only traced it with certainty in  two individuals. But I understand that it included the idea that I had  come to the town to attend the Laundry Convention, and had made an  eloquent speech to that senate, no doubt exhibiting my tubs.    Such was the penalty of too passionate and unrestrained an admiration  for American bathrooms; yet the connection of ideas, however  inconsequent, does cover the part of social practice for which these  American institutions can really be praised. About everything like  laundry or hot and cold water there is not only organisation, but what  does not always or perhaps often go with it, efficiency. Americans are  particular about these things of dress and decorum; and it is a virtue  which I very seriously recognise, though I find it very hard to emulate.  But with them it is a virtue; it is not a mere convention, still less a  mere fashion. It is really related to human dignity rather than to  social superiority. The really glorious thing about the American is that  he does not dress like a gentleman; he dresses like a citizen or a  civilised man. His Puritanic particularity on certain points is really  detachable from any definite social ambitions; these things are not a  part of getting into society but merely of keeping out of savagery.  Those millions and millions of middling people, that huge middle class  especially of the Middle West, are not near enough to any aristocracy  even to be sham aristocrats, or to be real snobs. But their standards  are secure; and though I do not really travel in a bath-tub, or believe  in the bath-tub philosophy and religion, I will not on this matter  recoil misanthropically from them: I prefer the tub of Dayton to the tub  of Diogenes. On these points there is really something a million times  better than efficiency, and that is something like equality.    In short, the American hotel is not America; but it is American. In some  respects it is as American as the English inn is English. And it is  symbolic of that society in this among other things: that it does tend  too much to uniformity; but that that very uniformity disguises not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27262"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 3, May 1906 (#5)"],[1,"invaded the hearts of the oppressors. Suffocating in the fumes of  their own dejection, disconcerted and terrified by the strength of the  revolt, they dissimulated the rage which they felt against it.    The phantom of Famine rose up before them, and their children wailed  plaintively in the darkness. The houses and the temples, enveloped in  shadow, melted into an inanimate chaos of iron and stone; a menacing  silence filled the streets with a clamminess as of death; life ceased,  for the force which created it had become conscious of itself; and  enslaved humanity had found the magic and invincible word to express its  will; it had enfranchised itself from the yoke; with its own eyes it had  seen its might,--the might of the creator.    These days were days of anguish to the rulers, to those who considered  themselves the masters of life; each night was as long as thousands of  nights, so thick was the gloom, so timidly shone the few fires scattered  through the city. And then the monster city, created by the centuries,  gorged with human blood, showed itself in all its shameful weakness; it  was but a pitiable mass of stone and wood. The blind windows of the  houses looked upon the street with a cold and sullen air, and out on the  highway marched with valiant step the real masters of life. They, too,  were hungry, more than the others perhaps; but they were used to it, and  the suffering of their bodies was not so sharp as the suffering of the  old masters of life; it did not extinguish the fire in their souls. They  glowed with the consciousness of their own strength, the presentiment of  victory sparkled in their eyes. They went about in the streets of the  city which had been their narrow and sombre prison, wherein they had  been overwhelmed with contempt, wherein their souls had been loaded with  abuse, and they saw the great importance of their work, and thus was  unveiled to them the sacred right they had to become the masters of  life, its creators and its lawgivers.    And the lifegiving word of union presented itself to them with a new  face, with a blinding clearness:    \"Comrade.\"    There among lying words it rang out boldly, as the joyous harbinger of  the time to come, of a new life open to all in the future;--far or near?  They felt that it depended upon them whether they advanced towards  liberty or themselves deferred its coming.    The prostitute who, but the evening before, was but a hungry beast,  sadly waiting on the muddy pavement to be accosted by some one who would  buy her caresses, the prostitute, too, heard this word, but was  undecided whether to repeat it. A man the like of whom she had never  seen till then approached her, laid his hand upon her shoulder and said  to her in an affectionate tone, \"Comrade.\" And she gave a little  embarrassed smile, ready to cry with the joy her wounded heart  experienced for the first time. Tears of pure gaiety shone in her eyes,  which, the night before, had looked at the world with a stupid and  insolent expression of a starving animal. In all the streets of the city  the outcasts celebrated the triumph of their reunion with the great  family of workers of the entire world; and the dead eyes of the houses  looked on with an air more and more cold and menacing.    The beggar to whom but the night before an obol was thrown, price of the  compassion of the well-fed, the beggar also heard this word; and it was  the first alms which aroused a feeling of gratitude in his poor heart,  gnawed by misery.    A coachman, a great big fellow whose patrons struck him that their blows  might be transmitted to his thin-flanked, weary horse, this man imbruted  by the noise of wheels upon the pavement, said, smiling, to a passer-by:  \"Well, Comrade!\" He was frightened at his own words. He took the reins  in his hands, ready to start, and looked at the passer-by, the joyous  smile not yet effaced from his big face. The other cast a friendly  glance at him and answered, shaking his head: \"Thanks, comrade; I will  go on foot; I am not going far.\"    \"Ah, the fine fellow!\" exclaimed the coachman enthusiastically; he  stirred in his seat, winking his eyes gaily, and started off somewhere  with a great clatter.    The people went in groups crowded together on the pavements, and the  great word destined to unite the world burst out more and more often  among them, like a spark: \"Comrade.\" A policeman, bearded, fierce, and  filled with the consciousness of his own importance, approached the  crowd surrounding an old orator at the corner of a street, and, after  having listened to the discourse, he said slowly: \"Assemblages are  interdicted ... disperse....\" And after a moment's silence, lowering his  eyes, he added, in a lower tone, \"Comrades.\"    The pride of young combatants was depicted in the faces of those who  carried the word in their hearts, who had given it flesh and blood and  the appeal to union; one felt that the strength they so generously  poured into this living word was indestructible, inexhaustible.    Here and there blind troops of armed men, dressed in gray, gathered and  formed ranks in silence; it was the fury of the oppressors preparing to  repulse the wave of justice.    And in the narrow streets of the immense city, between the cold and  silent walls raised by the hands of ignored creators, the noble belief  in Man and in Fraternity grew and ripened.    \"Comrade.\"--Sometimes in one corner, sometimes in another, the fire  burst out. Soon this fire would become the conflagration destined to  enkindle the earth with the ardent sentiment of kinship, uniting all its  peoples; destined to consume and reduce to ashes the rage, hate and  cruelty by which we are mutilated; the conflagration which will embrace  all hearts, melt them into one,--the heart of the world, the heart of  beings noble and just;--into one united family of workers.    In the streets of the dead city, created by slaves, in the streets of  the city where cruelty reigned, faith in humanity and in victory over  self and over the evil of the world grew and ripened. And in the vague  chaos of a dull and troubled existence, a simple word, profound as the  heart, shone like a star, like a light guiding toward the future:  COMRADE.    [Illustration]          ALEXANDER BERKMAN.    By E. G.    ON the 18th of this month the workhouse at Hoboken, Pa., will open its  iron gates for Alexander Berkman. One buried alive for fourteen years  will emerge from his tomb. That was not the intention of those who  indicted Berkman. In the kindness of their Christian hearts they saw to  it that he be sentenced to twenty-one years in the penitentiary and one  year in the workhouse, hoping that that would equal a death penalty,  only with a slow, refined execution. To achieve the feat of sending a  man to a gradual death, the authorities of Pittsburg at the command of  Mammon trampled upon their much-beloved laws and the legality of court  proceedings. These laws in Pennsylvania called for seven years  imprisonment for the attempt to kill, but that did not satisfy the  law-abiding citizen H. C. Frick. He saw to it that one indictment was  multiplied into six. He knew full well that he would meet with no  opposition from petrified injustice and the servile stupidity of the  judge and jury before whom Alexander Berkman was tried.    In looking over the events of 1892 and the causes that led up to the act  of Alexander Berkman, one beholds Mammon seated upon a throne built of  human bodies, without a trace of sympathy on its Gorgon brow for the  creatures it controls. These victims, bent and worn, with the reflex of  the glow of the steel and iron furnaces in their haggard faces, carry  their sacrificial offerings to the ever-insatiable monster, capitalism.  In its greed, however, it reaches out for more; it neither sees the  gleam of hate in the sunken eyes of its slaves, nor can it hear the  murmurs of discontent and rebellion coming forth from their heaving  breasts. Yet, discontent continues until one day it raises its mighty  voice and demands to be heard:    Human conditions! higher pay! fewer hours in the inferno at Homestead,  the stronghold of the \"philanthropist\" Carnegie!    He was far away, however, enjoying a much needed rest from hard labor,  in Scotland, his native country. Besides he knew he had left a worthy  representative in H. C. Frick, who could take care that the voice of  discontent was strangled in a fitting manner,--and Mr. Carnegie had  judged rightly.    Frick, who was quite experienced in the art of disposing of rebellious  spirits (he had had a number of them shot in the coke regions in 1890),  immediately issued an order for Pinkerton men, the vilest creatures in  the human family, who are engaged in the trade of murder for $2 per day.    The strikers declared that they would not permit these men to land, but  money and power walk shrewd and cunning paths. The Pinkerton  blood-hounds were packed into a boat and were to be smuggled into  Homestead by way of water in the stillness of night. The amalgamated  steel workers learned of this contemptible trick and prepared to meet  the foe. They gathered by the shores of the Monongahela River armed with  sticks and stones, but ere they had time for an attack a violent fire  was opened from the boat that neared the shore, and within an hour  eleven strikers lay dead from the bullets of Frick's hirelings.    Every beast is satisfied when it has devoured its prey,--not so the  human beast. After the killing of the strikers H. C. Frick had the  families of the dead evicted from their homes, which had been sold to  the workingmen on the instalment plan and at the exorbitant prices usual  in such cases.    Out of these homes the wives and children of the men struggling for a  living wage were thrown into the street and left without shelter. There  was one exception only. A woman who had given birth to a baby two days  previous and who,"]]]
