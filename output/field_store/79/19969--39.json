[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],[0,"Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#5)"],[1,"description, is supposed to  take place in York Minster and turns on the repairs which were made in  1832 to the famous organ-screen which separates the nave and transepts  from the chancel.  The question of altering the position of the screen is  debated with much humour and vivacity.    Before leaving the North Riding, reference must be made to Elizabeth  Tweddell, the gifted poetess of the Cleveland Hills.  Born at Stokesley  in 1833, the daughter of Thomas Cole, the parish-clerk of that town, she  married George Markham Tweddell, the author of The People's History of  Cleveland, and in 1875 she published a slender volume of dialect verse  and prose entitled Rhymes and Sketches to Illustrate the Cleveland  Dialect. In her modest preface Mrs.  Tweddell declares that the only  merit of her work lies in \"the stringing together of a good many  Cleveland words and expressions that are fast becoming obsolete\"; but the  volume has far deeper claims on our gratitude than this.  There is much  homely charm in her rhymes and sketches, and the two extracts which find  a place in this collection are models of what simple dialect-poems should  be.  Above all, Mrs. Tweddell has the gift of humour; this is well  illustrated by the song, \"Dean't mak gam o' me,\" and also by her  well-known prose story, \"Awd Gab o' Steers.\" Her most sustained effort in  verse is the poem entitled \" T' Awd Cleveland Customs,\" in which she  gives us a delightful picture of the festive seasons of the Cleveland  year from \" Newery Day,\" with its \"lucky bod,\" to \"Kessamus,\" with its  \"sooard dancers.\"    The western portion of the North Riding, including Swale and Wensleydale,  has been less fruitful in dialect poetry than the eastern.  Apart from  the anonymous \"Wensleydale Lad\" already noticed, it is represented in  this anthology only by the spirited poem, \"Reeth Bartle Fair,\" the work  of a true lover of dialect speech, Captain John Harland, who published  for the English Dialect Society a valuable glossary of Swaledale words  (1873).  The Craven country, the dialect of which differs materially from  that spoken in the manufacturing districts of the West, Riding, is not  without its bards.  These include James Henry Dixon (1803-1876),--a  local historian and antiquary of scholarly tastes, who edited for the  Percy Society the delightful collection of folk-poetry entitled, Ancient  Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England (1846).  Mr. Dixon  wrote comparatively little poetry himself, but his song, \"The  Milkin'-time,\" has the lilt of the best Scottish folk-songs and well  deserves its inclusion here.  In a longer poem, \"Slaadburn Faar\" (1871),  he gives a humorous and racy description of the adventures of a farmer  and his wife on their journey from Grassington to Slaidburn to attend the  local fair.  In general idea it resembles Harland's \"Reeth Bartle Fair,\"  which appeared in the preceding year.    But the typical poet of the Craven country was Tom Twistleton, a farmer  near Settle, whose Poems in the Craven, Dialect first appeared in 1869,  and soon ran through several editions.  He was a disciple of Burns, and  his poem \"The Christmas-Party\" (see below) daringly challenges comparison  with the immortal \"Halloween.\" His description of the dancing in the  farm-house kitchen, and of the adventures of the pair of lovers who  escape from the merry throng, is singularly vivid, and illustrates the  author's ready humour and keen observation of rustic life and character.    Reference has already been made to the Nidderdill Olminac which ,vas  produced by \"Nattie Nidds\" between 1864 and 1880 and published at Pateley  Bridge.  Among the contributors to it was Thomas Blackah, a working miner  of Greenhow Hill, who in 1867 published a volume of dialect verse  entitled Songs and Poems in the Nidderdale Dialect.  In their truth to  life, homely charm and freedom from pretentiousness, these dialect poems  resemble those of Mrs. Tweddell, and deserve a wider recognition than  they have so far won.    After this excursion into the dales of the North and West Riding, where,  apart from mining, the life of the people is largely spent on the farm,  we must turn once again to the industrial Yorkshire of the south-west,  and see to what extent dialect poetry has flourished in the smoke-laden  air of chimney-stacks and blast-furnaces, and with what success the  Yorkshire dialect poets of the towns and cities have interpreted the life  and thoughts of those who work in the mill or at the forge.  As we have  already seen, the first attempts to interpret in dialect poetry the life  of industrial Yorkshire were made at Sheffield early in the nineteenth  century by Abel Bywater.  As the century advanced, the movement spread  northwards, and the great artisan communities of Bradford, Leeds, and  Halifax produced their poets.  Among these pre-eminence belongs to Ben  Preston, the Bradford poet, who stepped swiftly into local fame by the  publication of his well-known poem, \"Natterin' Nan,\" which first appeared  in a Bradford journal in 1856.  This is a vigorous piece of dramatic  realism, setting forth the character of a Yorkshire scold and grumbler  with infinite zest and humour.  But it is in pathos that the genius of  Preston chiefly consists.  In poems like \"Owd Moxy,\" \"T' Lancashire  Famine,\" and \"I niver can call her my wife,\" he gives us pictures of the  struggle that went on in the cottage-homes of the West Riding during the  \"hungry forties.\" In \"Owd Moxy\" his subject is the old waller who has to  face the pitiless winter wind and rain as he plies his dreary task on the  moors; but in most of his poems it is the life of the handloom-weaver  that he interprets.  The kindliness of his nature is everywhere apparent  and gives a sincerity to the poems in which he portrays with rare  discernment and sympathy the sufferings of the artisan, toiling from  morning to night on eight shillings a week.  His pathos has dignity and  restraint, and in the poem \"I niver can call her my wife\" it rises to the  heights of great tragedy.  This is Ben Preston's masterpiece, and, though  scarcely known outside of the county, it deserves to take a place side by  side with Hood's \" Song of the Shirt\" by reason of the poignancy with  which it interprets the tragedy of penury.(5)    The example set by Ben Preston has been followed by other dialect poets  living in the district round Bradford.  Mention may be made of James  Burnley, whose poem, \"Jim's Letter,\" is a telling illustration of the  fine use which can be made of dialect in the service of the dramatic  lyric; and of Abraham Holroyd, who not only wrote original verse, but  also made a valuable collection of old Yorkshire songs and ballads.(6)    The rivalry between Bradford and Leeds is proverbial, and, though the  latter city has lagged behing Bradford in the production of dialect  literature, the Yorkshire Songs of J. H. Eccles, published in 1862, is a  notable contribution to the movement whose history is here being  recorded.  In John Hartley, Halifax possessed the most versatile  dialect-writer that Yorkshire has so far produced.  For fifty years this  writer, who died in 1915, poured forth lyric song and prose tale in  unstinted measure.  Most of his dialect work found a place in the  Original Illuminated Clock Almanac, which he edited from 1867 until his  death; but from time to time he gathered the best of his work into book  form, and his Yorkshire Lyrics, published in 1898, occupy a place of  honour in many a Yorkshire home.  The examples from his works here given  will serve to illustrate his fine ear for metrical harmony, his  imaginative power, and his sympathetic interpretation of Yorkshire  character.  Of the younger generation of Yorkshire poets, most of them  still alive, I must speak more briefly.  But it must not be overlooked  that, so far from there being any falling off in the volume or quality of  dialect-verse, it is safe to say that it has never been in so flourishing  a condition as at the present day.  Dialect poems are now being written  in all parts of the county.  Editors of weekly papers welcome them gladly  in their columns; the Yorkshire Dialect Society has recently opened the  pages of its annual Transactions to original contributions in verse and  prose, and every year the printing presses of London and Yorkshire  publish volumes of dialect verse.  Of individual writers, whose work  finds illustration in this anthology, mention may be made of the Rev. W.  H. Oxley, whose T' Fisher Folk o' Riley Brig (1888) marks, I believe, the  first attempt to interpret in verse the hazardous life of the east-coast  fisherman.  Farther north, Mr. G. H. Cowling has given us in his A  Yorkshire Tyke (1914) a number of spirited and winsome studies of the  life and thought of the Hackness peasant.  The wold country of the East  Riding has found its interpreter in Mr. J. A. Carill, whose Woz'ls  (1913) is full of delightful humour, as readers of \"Love and Pie\" will  readily discover for themselves.  \"The File-cutter's L'ament \" (see  below), which I have selected from Mr. Downing's volume, Smook thru' a  Shevvield Chimla, will show that the Sheffield \"blade\" is doing his best  to carry on the tradition set by Abel Bywater eighty years ago.  Airedale  still has its poets, among the most ambitious of whom is Mr.  Malham-Dembleby, who published in 1912 a volume of verse entitled,  Original Tales and Ballads in the Yorkshire Dialect.  Mr. F. J. Newboult  has deservedly won fame as a prosewriter in dialect; his dialect sketches  which have for some years appeared in The Yorkshire Observer are full of  broad humour and dramatic power, and his dainty little lyric \"Spring\" (p.  87) is a sufficient indication that he has also the dower of the poet.  In Alderman Ben Turner of Batley Yorkshire possesses a courageous  advocate of the social betterment of the working man and woman, and in  the midst of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#5)"],[1,"liable,      as various authors have insisted, to transmission, but they are noticed      here chiefly on account of their occasional regrowth after amputation.      Polydactylism graduates[26] by multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous      appendage, not including any bone, to a double hand. But an additional      digit, supported on a metacarpal bone, and furnished with all the      proper muscles, nerves, and vessels, is sometimes so perfect, that it      escapes detection, unless the fingers are actually counted.      Occasionally there are several supernumerary digits; but usually only      one, making the total number six. This one may represent either a thumb      or finger, being attached to the inner or outer margin of the hand.      Generally, through the law of correlation, both hands and feet are      similarly affected. I have tabulated the cases recorded in various      works or privately communicated {13} to me, of forty-six persons with      extra digits on one or both hands and feet; if in each case all four      extremities had been similarly affected, the table would have shown a      total of ninety-two hands and ninety-two feet each with six digits. As      it is, seventy-three hands and seventy-five feet were thus affected.      This proves, in contradiction to the result arrived at by Dr.      Struthers,[27] that the hands are not more frequently affected than the      feet.        The presence of more than five digits is a great anomaly, for this      number is not normally exceeded by any mammal, bird, or existing      reptile.[28] Nevertheless, supernumerary digits are strongly inherited;      they have been transmitted through five generations; and in some cases,      after disappearing for one, two, or even three generations, have      reappeared through reversion. These facts are rendered, as Professor      Huxley has observed, more remarkable from its being known in most cases      that the affected person had not married one similarly affected. In      such cases the child of the fifth generation would have only 1-32nd      part of the blood of his first sedigitated ancestor. Other cases are      rendered remarkable by the affection gathering force, as Dr. Struthers      has shown, in each generation, though in each the affected person had      married one not affected; moreover such additional digits are often      amputated soon after birth, and can seldom have been strengthened by      use. Dr. Struthers gives the following instance: in the first      generation an additional digit appeared on one hand; in the second, on      both hands; in the third, three brothers had both hands, and one of the      brothers a foot affected; and in the fourth generation all four limbs      were affected. Yet we must not over-estimate the force of inheritance.      Dr. Struthers asserts that cases of non-inheritance and of the first      appearance of additional digits in unaffected families are much more      frequent than cases of inheritance. Many other deviations of structure,      of a nature almost as anomalous as supernumerary digits, such as      deficient phalanges, thickened joints, crooked fingers, &c., are in      like manner strongly inherited, and are equally subject to intermission      with reversion, though in such cases there is no reason to suppose that      both parents had been similarly affected.[29]        {14}        Additional digits have been observed in negroes as well as in other      races of man, and in several of the lower animals. Six toes have been      described on the hind feet of the newt (_Salamandra cristata_), and, as      it is said, of the frog. It deserves notice from what follows, that the      six-toed newt, though adult, had preserved some of its larval      characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which is properly      absorbed during the act of metamorphosis, was retained. In the dog, six      toes on the hinder feet have been transmitted through three      generations; and I have heard of a race of six-toed cats. In several      breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is double, and is generally      transmitted truly, as is well shown when Dorkings are crossed with      common four-toed breeds.[30] With animals which have properly less than      five digits, the number is sometimes increased to five, especially in      the front legs, though rarely carried beyond that number; but this is      due to the development of a digit already existing in a more or less      rudimentary state. Thus the dog has properly four toes behind, but in      the larger breeds a fifth toe is commonly, though not perfectly,      developed. Horses, which properly have one toe alone fully developed      with rudiments of the others, have been described with each foot      bearing two or three small separate hoofs: analogous facts have been      noticed with sheep, goats, and pigs.[31]        The most interesting point with respect to supernumerary digits is      their occasional regrowth after amputation. Mr. White[32] describes a      child, three years old, with a thumb double from the first joint. He      removed the lesser thumb, which was furnished with a nail; but to his      astonishment it grew again, and reproduced a nail. The child was then      taken to an eminent London surgeon, and the newly-grown thumb was      wholly removed by its socket-joint, but again it grew and reproduced a      nail. Dr. Struthers mentions a case of partial regrowth of an      additional thumb, amputated when the child was three months old; and      the late Dr. Falconer communicated to me an analogous case which had      fallen under his own observation. A gentleman, who first called my      attention to this subject, has given me the following facts which      occurred in his own family. He himself, two brothers, and a sister were      born with an extra digit to each extremity. His parents were not      affected, and there was no tradition in the family, or in the village      in which the family had long resided, of any member having been thus      affected. Whilst a child, both additional toes, which were attached by      bones, were rudely cut off; but the stump of one grew again, and a      second operation was performed in his thirty-third year.        {15}        He has had fourteen children, of whom three have inherited additional      digits; and one of them, when about six weeks old, was operated on by      an eminent surgeon. The additional finger, which was attached by bone      to the outer side of the hand, was removed at the joint; the wound      healed, but immediately the digit began growing; and in about three      months' time the stump was removed for the second time by the root. But      it has since grown again, and is now fully a third of an inch in      length, including a bone; so that it will for the third time have to be      operated on.        Now the normal digits in adult man and other mammals, in birds, and, as      I believe, in true reptiles, have no power of regrowth. The nearest      approach to this power is exhibited by the occasional reappearance in      man of imperfect nails on the stumps of his fingers after      amputation.[33] But man in his embryonic condition has a considerable      power of reproduction, for Sir J. Simpson[34] has several times      observed arms which had been cut off in the womb by bands of false      membrane, and which had grown again to a certain extent. In one      instance, the extremity was \"divided into three minute nodules, on two      of which small points of nails could be detected;\" so that these      nodules clearly represented fingers in process of regrowth. When,      however, we descend to the lower vertebrate classes, which are      generally looked at as representing the higher classes in their      embryonic condition, we find ample powers of regrowth. Spallanzani[35]      cut off the legs and tail of a salamander six times, and Bonnet eight      times, successively, and they were reproduced. An additional digit      beyond the proper number was occasionally formed after Bonnet had cut      off or had divided longitudinally the hand or foot, and in one instance      three additional digits were thus formed.[36] These latter cases appear      at first sight quite distinct from the congenital production of      additional digits in the higher animals; but theoretically, as we shall      see in a future chapter, they probably present no real difference. The      larvae or tadpoles of the tailless Batrachians, but not the adults,[37]      are capable of reproducing lost members.[38] Lastly, as I have been      informed by Mr. J. J. Briggs and Mr. F. Buckland, when portions of the      pectoral and tail fins of various {16} fresh-water fish are cut off,      they are perfectly reproduced in about six weeks' time.    From these several facts we may infer that supernumerary digits in man  retain to a certain extent an embryonic condition, and that they resemble  in this respect the normal digits and limbs in the lower vertebrate  classes. They also resemble the digits of some of the lower animals in the  number exceeding five; for no mammal, bird, existing reptile, or amphibian  (unless the tubercle on the hind feet of the toad and other tailless  Batrachians be viewed as a digit) has more than five; whilst fishes  sometimes have in their pectoral fins as many as twenty metacarpal and  phalangeal bones, which, together with the bony filaments, apparently  represent our digits with their nails. So, again, in certain extinct  reptiles, namely, the Ichthyopterygia, \"the digits may be seven, eight, or  nine in number, a significant mark,\" says Professor Owen, \"of piscine  affinity.\"[39]    We encounter much difficulty in attempting to reduce these various facts to  any rule or law. The inconstant number of the additional digits--their  irregular attachment to either the inner or outer margin of"]]]
