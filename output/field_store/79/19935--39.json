This generic name is so familiarly known, that the appellation  `Wattle' might well be dispensed with.  Indeed the name Acacia  is in full use in works on travels and in many popular writings  for the numerous Australian species . . .

All this had to be brought in regularly--daily. There was  salted meat for winter; there was dried fish when fresh could not be  procured; there were granaries of wheat to provide for emergencies. All  the rest had to be provided day by day.    First, the East Saxons, settling in Essex and spreading over the whole  of that county, stopped the supplies and the trade over all the eastern  counties; then the Jutes, landing on the Isle of Thanet, stopped the  ships that went up and down the river; they also spread over the south  country and stopped the supplies that formerly came over London Bridge.  Then the Picts and Scots, followed by more Saxons, harassed the north  and middle of the island, and no more supplies came down Watling Street.  Lastly, the enemy, pressing northward from the south shore, gained the  middle reaches of the Thames, and no more supplies came down the river.    London was thus deprived of food as well as of trade.    This slowly, not suddenly, came to pass. First, one source of supply was  cut off, then another. First, trade declined in one quarter, then it  ceased in that quarter altogether. Next, another quarter was attacked.  The foreign merchants, since there was no trade left, went on board  their own ships and disappeared. Whether they succeeded in passing  through the pirate craft that crowded the mouth of the river, one knows  not. The bones of many lie at the bottom of the sea off the Nore. They  vanished from hapless Augusta; they came back no more.    Who were left? The native merchants. Despair was in their hearts;  starvation threatened them, even amid the dainty appointments of their  luxurious villas; what is the use of marble baths and silken hangings,  tesselated pavements, and pictures, and books, and statues, if there is  no food to be had, though one bid for it all the pictures in the house?  With the merchants, there were the priests, the physicians, the lawyers,  the actors and mimics, the artists, the teachers, all who minister to  religion, luxury, and culture. There were next the great mass of the  people, the clerks and scribes, the craftsmen, the salesmen, the  lightermen, stevedores, boatmen, marine store keepers, makers of ships'  gear, porters--slaves for the most part--all from highest to lowest,  plunged into helplessness. Whither could they fly for refuge? Upon whom  could they call for help?          7. AFTER THE ROMANS.    PART III.      Abroad, the Roman Empire was breaking up. The whole of Europe was  covered with war. Revolts of conquered tribes, rebellions of successful  generals, invasions of savages, the murders of usurpers, the sacking of  cities. Rome itself was sacked by Alaric; the conquest of one country  after another made of this period the darkest in the history of the  world. From over the seas no help, the enemy blocking the mouth of the  river, all the roads closed and all the farms destroyed.    There came a day at length when it was at last apparent that no more  supplies would reach the City. Then the people began to leave the place:  better to fight their way across the country to the west where the  Britons still held their own, than to stay and starve. The men took  their arms--they carried little treasure with them, because treasure  would be of no use to them on their way--their wives and children,  ladies as delicate and as helpless as any of our own time--children as  unfit as our own to face the miseries of cold and hunger and  nakedness--and they went out by the gate of Watling Street, not  altogether, not the whole population, but in small companies, for  greater safety. They left the City by the gate; they did not journey  along the road, but for safety turned aside into the great forest, and  so marching across moors and marshes, past burned homesteads, and  ruined villages, and farm buildings thrown down, those of them who did  not perish by the way under the enemies' sword or by malarious fever, or  by starvation, reached the Severn and the border of the mountains where  the Saxon could not penetrate.    There was left behind a remnant--after every massacre or exodus there is  always left a remnant. The people who stayed in the City were only a few  and those of the baser sort, protected by their wretchedness and  poverty. No one would kill those who offer no defence and have no  treasures; and their condition under any new masters would be no worse.  They shut the gates and barred them: they closed and barred the Bridge:  they took out of the houses anything that they wanted--the soft warm  mantles, the woollen garments, the coverlets, the pillows and hangings,  but they abode in their hovels near the river banks; as for the works of  art, the pictures, statues, and tesselated pavements, these they left  where they found them or for wantonness destroyed them. They fished in  the river for their food: they hunted over the marshes where are now  Westminster, Battersea, and Lambeth: the years passed by and no one  disturbed them: they still crouched in their huts while the thin veneer  of civilisation was gradually lost with whatever arts they had learned  and all their religion except the terror of the Unknown.    Meanwhile the roofs of the villas and churches fell in, the walls  decayed, the gardens were overgrown. Augusta--the proud and stately  Augusta--was reduced to a wall enclosing a heap of ruins with a few  savages huddled together in hovels by the riverside.    For the East Saxon had overrun Essex, the Jute covered Kent and Surrey,  the South Saxon held Sussex, the West Saxon held Wessex. All around--on  every side--London was surrounded by the Conqueror of the Land. Why,  then, did they not take London? Because London was deserted; there was  nothing to take: London was silent. No ships going up or down the river  reminded the Saxon of the City. It lay amid its marshes and its moors,  the old roads choked and overgrown; it was forgotten; it was what the  Saxons had already made of Canterbury and Anderida, a 'Waste Chester,'  that is, a desolated stronghold.    Augusta was forgotten.    This is the story that we learn from the actual site of London--its  position among marshes, the conditions under which alone the people  could be maintained.    How long did this oblivion continue? No one knows when it began or when  it ended. As I read the story of the past, I find a day towards the  close of the sixth century when there appeared within sight of the  deserted walls a company of East Saxons. They were hunting: they were  armed with spears: they followed the chase through the great forest  afterwards called the Middlesex Forest, Epping Forest, Hainault Forest,  and across the marshes of the river Lea, full of sedge and reed and  treacherous quagmires. And they saw before them the gray walls of a  great city of which they had never heard.    They advanced cautiously: they found themselves on a firm road, the  Vicinal Way, covered with grass: they expected the sight of an enemy on  the wall: none appeared. The gates were closed, the timbers were rotten  and fell down at a touch: the men broke through and found themselves  among the streets of a city all in ruins. They ran about--shouting--no  one appeared: the City was deserted.    They went away and told what they had found.    But Augusta had perished. When the City appears again it is under its  more ancient name--it is again London.          8. THE FIRST SAXON SETTLEMENT.      A hundred and fifty years passed away between the landing of the East  Saxons and their recorded occupation of the City. This long period made  a great difference in the fierce savage who followed the standard of the  White Horse and landed on the coast of Essex. He became more peaceful:  he settled down contentedly to periods of tranquillity. Certain arts he  acquired, and he learned to live in towns: as yet he was not a  Christian. This means that the influence of Rome with its religion, its  learning and its arts had not yet touched him.    But he had begun to live in towns; and he lived in London.    Perhaps the first of the new settlers were the foreign merchants  returning, as soon as more settled times allowed, with their cargoes.  London has always been a place of trade. But for trade no one would have  settled in it. Therefore, either the men of Essex invited the foreign  merchants to return; or the foreign merchants returned and invited the  men of Essex to come into the City and to bring with them what they had  to exchange.    In the year 597 Augustine, prior of a Roman monastery, was sent by Pope  Gregory the Great with forty monks, to convert the English. Ethelbert,  King of Kent, and most powerful of the English kinglets, was married to  Bertha, a Christian princess. She had brought with her a chaplain and it  was probably at her invitation or through her influence, that the monks  were sent. They landed at Thanet. They obtained permission to meet the  King in the open air. They appeared wearing their robes, carrying a  crucifix, and chanting Psalms. It is probable that the conversion of the  King had been arranged beforehand; for without any difficulty or delay  the King and all his Court, and, following the King's example, all the  people were baptised.    Augustine returned to Rome where he was consecrated Archbishop of the  English nation. A church was built at Canterbury, and the work of  preaching the Faith went on vigorously. The East Saxons made no more  hesitation at being baptised than the men of Kent. Ethelbert, indeed,  could command obedience; he was Over Lord of all the nations south of  the Humber. He it was, according to Bede, who built the first church of  St. Paul in London, a fact which proves his authority and influence in  London, and his sincere desire that the East Saxons should become  Christians.    They did, in a way."]]]
