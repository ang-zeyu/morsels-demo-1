Is it possible? not know the figures of Heraldry!    Of what could your father be thinking?\"      --ROB ROY.        [Illustration: No. 4.]    The sentiment unquestionably was his own which Sir Walter Scott made  delightful Di Vernon express when, with indignant surprise, she asked  Frank Osbaldistone of what his father could have been thinking, that he  had been permitted to grow up without any knowledge of Heraldry. Sir  Walter was right in his estimate of the high value of Heraldry as an  element of education: and, in professing herself a votaress of the  Herald's \"gentle science,\" it was quite right in Di Vernon to suggest to  other ladies that it would be well for them if Heraldry should find  favour in their eyes also. The age of Rob Roy, however, was far from  being in harmony with heraldic associations: nor was the author of  \"Waverley\" himself permitted to accomplish more, than to lead the way to  that revival of a popular sympathy with every expression of early Art,  which now forms one of the most remarkable characteristics of our own  era.    In the olden time, in England, the love of Heraldry, which was prevalent  amongst all classes, was based upon an intelligent appreciation of its  worthiness. A part of the feudal system of the Middle Ages, and at once  derived from the prevailing form of thought and feeling, and imparting  to it a brilliant colouring peculiar to itself, Heraldry exercised a  powerful influence upon the manners and habits of the people amongst  whom it was in use. By our early ancestors, accordingly, as Mr. Montagu  has so happily written, \"little given to study of any kind, a knowledge  of Heraldry was considered indispensable:\" to them it was the \"outward  sign of the spirit of chivalry, the index, also, to a lengthened  chronicle of doughty deeds.\" And this Heraldry grew up, spontaneously  and naturally, out of the circumstances and requirements of those times.  It came into existence, because it was needed for practical use; it was  accepted and cherished, because it did much more than fulfil its avowed  purpose. At first, simply useful to distinguish particular individuals,  especially in war and at the tournament, English Heraldry soon became  popular; and then, with no less rapidity, it rose to high honour and  dignity.    From the circumstance that it first found its special use in direct  connection with military equipments, knightly exercises, and the _mêlée_  of actual battle, mediæval Heraldry has also been entitled ARMORY. Men  wore the ensigns of Heraldry about their persons, embroidered upon the  garments that partially covered their armour,--and so they called them  _Coats-of-Arms_: they bore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2323"],[0,"Recollections and Letters of General Robert E.

Received orders from the Secretary of War in person,  to repair in evening train to Harper's Ferry.    \"Reached Harper's Ferry at 11 P.M.... Posted marines in the United  States Armory. Waited until daylight, as a number of citizens were held  as hostages, whose lives were threatened. Tuesday about sunrise,  with twelve marines, under Lieutenant Green, broke in the door of the  engine-house, secured the insurgents, and relieved the prisoners unhurt.  All the insurgents killed or mortally wounded, but four, John Brown,  Stevens, Coppie, and Shields.\"    Brown was tried and convicted and sentenced to be hanged on December 2,  1859. Colonel Lee writes as follows to his wife:    \"Harper's Ferry, December 1, 1859.    \"I arrived here, dearest Mary, yesterday about noon, with four companies  from Fort Monroe, and was busy all the evening and night getting  accommodation for the men, etc., and posting sentinels and piquets to  insure timely notice of the approach of the enemy. The night has passed  off quietly. The feelings of the community seem to be calmed down, and  I have been received with every kindness. Mr. Fry is among the officers  from Old Point. There are several young men, former acquaintances of  ours, as cadets, Mr. Bingham of Custis's class, Sam Cooper, etc., but  the senior officers I never met before, except Captain Howe, the friend  of our Cousin Harriet R----.    \"I presume we are fixed her till after the 16th. To-morrow will probably  be the last of Captain Brown. There will be less interest for the  others, but still I think the troops will not be withdrawn till they are  similarly disposed of.    \"Custis will have informed you that I had to go to Baltimore the  evening I left you, to make arrangements for the transportation of the  troops.... This morning I was introduced to Mrs. Brown, who, with a Mrs.  Tyndall and a Mr. And Mrs. McKim, all from Philadelphia, had come on to  have a last interview with her husband. As it is a matter over which I  have no control I referred them to General Taliaferro [General William  B. Taliaferro, commanding Virginia troops at Harper's Ferry].    \"You must write to me at this place. I hope you are all well. Give love  to everybody. Tell Smith [Sydney Smith Lee, of the United States Navy,  his brother] that no charming women have insisted on taking care of me  as they are always doing of him--I am left to my own resources. I will  write you again soon, and will always be truly and affectionately yours,    \"Mrs. M. C. Lee. R. E. Lee.\"    In February, 1860, he was ordered to take command of the Department of  Texas. There he remained a year. The first months after his arrival  were spent in the vain pursuit of the famous brigand, Cortinez, who was  continually stealing across the Rio Grande, burning the homes, driving  off the stock of the ranchmen, and then retreating into Mexico. The  summer months he spent in San Antonio, and while there interested  himself with the good people of that town in building an Episcopal  church, to which he contributed largely.

He immediately relinquished the command of his regiment, and  departed from Fort Mason, Texas, for Washington. He reached Arlington  March 1st. April 17th, Virginia seceded. On the 18th Colonel Lee had  a long interview with General Scott. On April 20th he tendered his  resignation of his commission in the United States Army. The same day he  wrote to General Scott the following letter:    \"Arlington, Virginia, April 20, 1861.    \"General: Since my interview with you on the 18th inst. I have felt  that I ought no longer to retain my commission in the Army. I  therefore tender my resignation, which I request you will recommend for  acceptance. It would have been presented at once but for the struggle  it has cost me to separate myself from a service to which I have devoted  the best years of my life, and all the ability I possessed.    \"During the whole of that time--more than a quarter of a century--I have  experienced nothing but kindness from my superiors and a most cordial  friendship from my comrades. To no one, General, have I been as much  indebted as to yourself for uniform kindness and consideration, and  it has always been my ardent desire to merit your approbation. I  shall carry tot he grave the most grateful recollections of your kind  consideration, and your name and fame shall always be dear to me.    \"Save in the defense of my native State, I never desire again to draw my  sword.    \"Be pleased to accept my most earnest wishes for the continuance of your  happiness and prosperity, and believe me most truly yours,    \"(Signed)    \"R. E. Lee\"    His resignation was written the same day.    \"Arlington, Washington City P.O., April 20, 1861.    \"Honourable Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.    \"Sir: I have the honour to tender the resignation of my command as  Colonel of the First Regiment of Cavalry.    \"Very respectfully your obedient servant,    \"R. E. Lee,    \"Colonel First Cavalry.\"    To show further his great feeling in thus having to leave the army with  which he had been associated for so long, I give two more letters,  one to his sister, Mrs. Anne Marshall, of Baltimore, the other to his  brother, Captain Sydney Smith Lee, of the United States Navy:    \"Arlington, Virginia, April 20, 1861.    \"My Dear Sister: I am grieved at my inability to see you.... I have been  waiting for a 'more convenient season,' which has brought to many before  me deep and lasting regret. Now we are in a state of war which will  yield to nothing. The whole South is in a state of revolution, into  which Virginia, after a long struggle, has been drawn; and though I  recognise no necessity for this state of things, and would have forborne  and pleaded to the end for redress of grievances, real or supposed, yet  in my own person I had to meet the question whether I should take part  against my native State.    \"With all my devotion to the Union and the feeling of loyalty and duty  of an American citizen, I have not been able to make up my mind to raise  my hand against my relatives, my children, my home. I have therefore  resigned my commission in the Army, and save in defense of my native  State, with the sincere hope that my poor services may never be needed,  I hope I may never be called on to draw my sword. I know you will blame  me; but you must think as kindly of me as you can, and believe that I  have endeavoured to do what I thought right.    \"To show you the feeling and struggle it has cost me, I send you a copy  of my letter of resignation. I have no time for more. May God guard and  protect you and yours, and shower upon you everlasting blessings, is the  prayer of your devoted brother, R. E. Lee.\"    \"Arlington, Virginia, April 20, 1860.    \"My Dear Brother Smith: The question which was the subject of my earnest  consultation with you on the 18th inst. has in my own mind been decided.  After the most anxious inquiry as to the correct course for me to  pursue, I concluded to resign, and sent in my resignation this morning.  I wished to wait till the Ordinance of secession should be acted on by  the people of Virginia; but war seems to have commenced, and I am liable  at any time to be ordered on duty which I could not conscientiously  perform. To save me from such a position, and to prevent the necessity  of resigning under orders, I had to act at once, and before I could see  you again on the subject, as I had wished. I am now a private citizen,  and have no other ambition than to remain at home. Save in defense of my  native State, I have no desire ever again to draw my sword. I send you  my warmest love.    \"Your affectionate brother,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    I will give here one of my father's letters, written after the war, in  which is his account of his resignation from the United States Army:    \"Lexington, Virginia, February 25, 1868.    \"Honourable Reverdy Johnson,    \"United States Senate, Washington, D. C.    \"My Dear Sir: My attention has been called to the official report of the  debate in the Senate of the United States, on the 19th instant, in which  you did my the kindness to doubt the correctness of the statement made  by the Honourable Simon Cameron, in regard to myself. I desire that you  may feel certain of my conduct on the occasion referred to, so far as my  individual statement can make you. I never intimated to any one that  I desired the command of the United States Army; nor did I ever have a  conversation with but one gentleman, Mr. Francis Preston Blair, on  the subject, which was at his invitation, and, as I understood, at  the instance of President Lincoln. After listening to his remarks, I  declined the offer that he made me, to take command of the army that was  to be brought into the field; stating, as candidly and courteously as  I could, that, though opposed to secession and deprecating war, I could  take no part in an invasion of the Southern States. I went directly from  the interview with Mr. Blair to the office of General Scott; told him  of the proposition that had been made to me, and my decision.
