The house had a name and a history; the old  gentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these  things: how it had been built under Edward the Sixth, had offered a  night's hospitality to the great Elizabeth (whose august person had  extended itself upon a huge, magnificent and terribly angular bed which  still formed the principal honour of the sleeping apartments), had been  a good deal bruised and defaced in Cromwell's wars, and then, under the  Restoration, repaired and much enlarged; and how, finally, after having  been remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century, it had passed  into the careful keeping of a shrewd American banker, who had bought it  originally because (owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth)  it was offered at a great bargain: bought it with much grumbling at its  ugliness, its antiquity, its incommodity, and who now, at the end of  twenty years, had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it,  so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand  to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of  its various protuberances which fell so softly upon the warm, weary  brickwork--were of the right measure. Besides this, as I have said,  he could have counted off most of the successive owners and occupants,  several of whom were known to general fame; doing so, however, with an  undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not  the least honourable. The front of the house overlooking that portion  of the lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance-front; this  was in quite another quarter. Privacy here reigned supreme, and the wide  carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension  of a luxurious interior. The great still oaks and beeches flung down a  shade as dense as that of velvet curtains; and the place was furnished,  like a room, with cushioned seats, with rich-coloured rugs, with  the books and papers that lay upon the grass. The river was at some  distance; where the ground began to slope the lawn, properly speaking,  ceased. But it was none the less a charming walk down to the water.    The old gentleman at the tea-table, who had come from America thirty  years before, had brought with him, at the top of his baggage, his  American physiognomy; and he had not only brought it with him, but he  had kept it in the best order, so that, if necessary, he might have  taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence. At present,  obviously, nevertheless, he was not likely to displace himself; his  journeys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the  great rest. He had a narrow, clean-shaven face, with features evenly  distributed and an expression of placid acuteness. It was evidently a  face in which the range of representation was not large, so that the air  of contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit. It seemed to tell  that he had been successful in life, yet it seemed to tell also that his  success had not been exclusive and invidious, but had had much of the  inoffensiveness of failure. He had certainly had a great experience of  men, but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that  played upon his lean, spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous eye  as he at last slowly and carefully deposited his big tea-cup upon the  table. He was neatly dressed, in well-brushed black; but a shawl was  folded upon his knees, and his feet were encased in thick, embroidered  slippers. A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair,  watching the master's face almost as tenderly as the master took in the  still more magisterial physiognomy of the house; and a little bristling,  bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other  gentlemen.    One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty, with a  face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was  something else; a noticeably handsome face, fresh-coloured, fair and  frank, with firm, straight features, a lively grey eye and the rich  adornment of a chestnut beard. This person had a certain fortunate,  brilliant exceptional look--the air of a happy temperament fertilised by  a high civilisation--which would have made almost any observer envy him  at a venture. He was booted and spurred, as if he had dismounted from a  long ride; he wore a white hat, which looked too large for him; he  held his two hands behind him, and in one of them--a large, white,  well-shaped fist--was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves.    His companion, measuring the length of the lawn beside him, was a person  of quite a different pattern, who, although he might have excited  grave curiosity, would not, like the other, have provoked you to wish  yourself, almost blindly, in his place. Tall, lean, loosely and feebly  put together, he had an ugly, sickly, witty, charming face, furnished,  but by no means decorated, with a straggling moustache and whisker. He  looked clever and ill--a combination by no means felicitous; and he wore  a brown velvet jacket. He carried his hands in his pockets, and there  was something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate.  His gait had a shambling, wandering quality; he was not very firm on  his legs. As I have said, whenever he passed the old man in the chair he  rested his eyes upon him; and at this moment, with their faces brought  into relation, you would easily have seen they were father and son.  The father caught his son's eye at last and gave him a mild, responsive  smile.    \"I'm getting on very well,\" he said.    \"Have you drunk your tea?\" asked the son.    \"Yes, and enjoyed it.\"    \"Shall I give you some more?\"    The old man considered, placidly. \"Well, I guess I'll wait and see.\" He  had, in speaking, the American tone.    \"Are you cold?\" the son enquired.    The father slowly rubbed his legs. \"Well, I don't know. I can't tell  till I feel.\"    \"Perhaps some one might feel for you,\" said the younger man, laughing.    \"Oh, I hope some one will always feel for me! Don't you feel for me,  Lord Warburton?\"    \"Oh yes, immensely,\" said the gentleman addressed as Lord Warburton,  promptly. \"I'm bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable.\"    \"Well, I suppose I am, in most respects.\" And the old man looked down at  his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees. \"The fact is I've been  comfortable so many years that I suppose I've got so used to it I don't  know it.\"    \"Yes, that's the bore of comfort,\" said Lord Warburton. \"We only know  when we're uncomfortable.\"    \"It strikes me we're rather particular,\" his companion remarked.    \"Oh yes, there's no doubt we're particular,\" Lord Warburton murmured.  And then the three men remained silent a while; the two younger ones  standing looking down at the other, who presently asked for more tea. \"I  should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl,\" Lord Warburton  resumed while his companion filled the old man's cup again.    \"Oh no, he must have the shawl!\" cried the gentleman in the velvet coat.  \"Don't put such ideas as that into his head.\"    \"It belongs to my wife,\" said the old man simply.    \"Oh, if it's for sentimental reasons--\" And Lord Warburton made a  gesture of apology.    \"I suppose I must give it to her when she comes,\" the old man went on.    \"You'll please to do nothing of the kind. You'll keep it to cover your  poor old legs.\"    \"Well, you mustn't abuse my legs,\" said the old man. \"I guess they are  as good as yours.\"    \"Oh, you're perfectly free to abuse mine,\" his son replied, giving him  his tea.    \"Well, we're two lame ducks; I don't think there's much difference.\"    \"I'm much obliged to you for calling me a duck. How's your tea?\"    \"Well, it's rather hot.\"    \"That's intended to be a merit.\"    \"Ah, there's a great deal of merit,\" murmured the old man, kindly. \"He's  a very good nurse, Lord Warburton.\"    \"Isn't he a bit clumsy?\" asked his lordship.    \"Oh no, he's not clumsy--considering that he's an invalid himself. He's  a very good nurse--for a sick-nurse. I call him my sick-nurse because  he's sick himself.\"    \"Oh, come, daddy!\" the ugly young man exclaimed.    \"Well, you are; I wish you weren't. But I suppose you can't help it.\"    \"I might try: that's an idea,\" said the young man.    \"Were you ever sick, Lord Warburton?\" his father asked.    Lord Warburton considered a moment. \"Yes, sir, once, in the Persian  Gulf.\"    \"He's making light of you, daddy,\" said the other young man. \"That's a  sort of joke.\"    \"Well, there seem to be so many sorts now,\" daddy replied, serenely.  \"You don't look as if you had been sick, anyway, Lord Warburton.\"    \"He's sick of life; he was just telling me so; going on fearfully about  it,\" said Lord Warburton's friend.    \"Is that true, sir?\" asked the old man gravely.    \"If it is, your son gave me no consolation. He's a wretched fellow to  talk to--a regular cynic. He doesn't seem to believe in anything.\"    \"That's another sort of joke,\" said the person accused of cynicism.    \"It's because his health is so poor,\" his father explained to Lord  Warburton. \"It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at  things; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance. But it's  almost entirely theoretical, you know; it doesn't seem to affect his  spirits. I've hardly ever seen him when he wasn't cheerful--about as he  is at present. He often cheers me up.\"    The young man so described looked at Lord Warburton and laughed. \"Is it  a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity? Should you like me to carry  out my theories, daddy?\"    \"By Jove, we should see some queer things!\" cried Lord Warburton.    \"I hope you haven't taken up that sort of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2834"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"principally for holidays. I miss Madame Catherine almost more; but you  must not tell him that. You shall not see him again? I'm very sorry,  and he'll be sorry too. Of everyone who comes here I like you the best.  That's not a great compliment, for there are not many people. It was  very kind of you to come to-day--so far from your house; for I'm really  as yet only a child. Oh, yes, I've only the occupations of a child. When  did YOU give them up, the occupations of a child? I should like to know  how old you are, but I don't know whether it's right to ask. At the  convent they told us that we must never ask the age. I don't like to do  anything that's not expected; it looks as if one had not been properly  taught. I myself--I should never like to be taken by surprise. Papa left  directions for everything. I go to bed very early. When the sun goes off  that side I go into the garden. Papa left strict orders that I was not  to get scorched. I always enjoy the view; the mountains are so graceful.  In Rome, from the convent, we saw nothing but roofs and bell-towers. I  practise three hours. I don't play very well. You play yourself? I wish  very much you'd play something for me; papa has the idea that I should  hear good music. Madame Merle has played for me several times; that's  what I like best about Madame Merle; she has great facility. I shall  never have facility. And I've no voice--just a small sound like the  squeak of a slate-pencil making flourishes.\"    Isabel gratified this respectful wish, drew off her gloves and sat down  to the piano, while Pansy, standing beside her, watched her white  hands move quickly over the keys. When she stopped she kissed the child  good-bye, held her close, looked at her long. \"Be very good,\" she said;  \"give pleasure to your father.\"    \"I think that's what I live for,\" Pansy answered. \"He has not much  pleasure; he's rather a sad man.\"    Isabel listened to this assertion with an interest which she felt it  almost a torment to be obliged to conceal. It was her pride that obliged  her, and a certain sense of decency; there were still other things in  her head which she felt a strong impulse, instantly checked, to say  to Pansy about her father; there were things it would have given her  pleasure to hear the child, to make the child, say. But she no sooner  became conscious of these things than her imagination was hushed with  horror at the idea of taking advantage of the little girl--it was of  this she would have accused herself--and of exhaling into that air where  he might still have a subtle sense for it any breath of her charmed  state. She had come--she had come; but she had stayed only an hour. She  rose quickly from the music-stool; even then, however, she lingered a  moment, still holding her small companion, drawing the child's sweet  slimness closer and looking down at her almost in envy. She was obliged  to confess it to herself--she would have taken a passionate pleasure in  talking of Gilbert Osmond to this innocent, diminutive creature who  was so near him. But she said no other word; she only kissed Pansy once  again. They went together through the vestibule, to the door that  opened on the court; and there her young hostess stopped, looking rather  wistfully beyond. \"I may go no further. I've promised papa not to pass  this door.\"    \"You're right to obey him; he'll never ask you anything unreasonable.\"    \"I shall always obey him. But when will you come again?\"    \"Not for a long time, I'm afraid.\"    \"As soon as you can, I hope. I'm only a little girl,\" said Pansy, \"but  I shall always expect you.\" And the small figure stood in the high, dark  doorway, watching Isabel cross the clear, grey court and disappear into  the brightness beyond the big portone, which gave a wider dazzle as it  opened.        CHAPTER XXXI    Isabel came back to Florence, but only after several months; an interval  sufficiently replete with incident. It is not, however, during this  interval that we are closely concerned with her; our attention is  engaged again on a certain day in the late spring-time, shortly after  her return to Palazzo Crescentini and a year from the date of the  incidents just narrated. She was alone on this occasion, in one of the  smaller of the numerous rooms devoted by Mrs. Touchett to social uses,  and there was that in her expression and attitude which would have  suggested that she was expecting a visitor. The tall window was open,  and though its green shutters were partly drawn the bright air of the  garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with  warmth and perfume. Our young woman stood near it for some time, her  hands clasped behind her; she gazed abroad with the vagueness of unrest.  Too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle. Yet it could not  be in her thought to catch a glimpse of her visitor before he should  pass into the house, since the entrance to the palace was not through  the garden, in which stillness and privacy always reigned. She wished  rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture, and to judge  by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do. Grave  she found herself, and positively more weighted, as by the experience of  the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world. She had ranged,  she would have said, through space and surveyed much of mankind, and  was therefore now, in her own eyes, a very different person from the  frivolous young woman from Albany who had begun to take the measure  of Europe on the lawn at Gardencourt a couple of years before. She  flattered herself she had harvested wisdom and learned a great deal  more of life than this light-minded creature had even suspected. If  her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect, instead  of fluttering their wings nervously about the present, they would have  evoked a multitude of interesting pictures. These pictures would have  been both landscapes and figure-pieces; the latter, however, would have  been the more numerous. With several of the images that might have been  projected on such a field we are already acquainted. There would be for  instance the conciliatory Lily, our heroine's sister and Edmund Ludlow's  wife, who had come out from New York to spend five months with her  relative. She had left her husband behind her, but had brought  her children, to whom Isabel now played with equal munificence and  tenderness the part of maiden-aunt. Mr. Ludlow, toward the last, had  been able to snatch a few weeks from his forensic triumphs and, crossing  the ocean with extreme rapidity, had spent a month with the two ladies  in Paris before taking his wife home. The little Ludlows had not yet,  even from the American point of view, reached the proper tourist-age; so  that while her sister was with her Isabel had confined her movements to  a narrow circle. Lily and the babies had joined her in Switzerland in  the month of July, and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an  Alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows and the shade  of great chestnuts made a resting-place for such upward wanderings as  might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons. They had  afterwards reached the French capital, which was worshipped, and with  costly ceremonies, by Lily, but thought of as noisily vacant by Isabel,  who in these days made use of her memory of Rome as she might have done,  in a hot and crowded room, of a phial of something pungent hidden in her  handkerchief.    Mrs. Ludlow sacrificed, as I say, to Paris, yet had doubts and  wonderments not allayed at that altar; and after her husband had joined  her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these  speculations. They all had Isabel for subject; but Edmund Ludlow, as  he had always done before, declined to be surprised, or distressed, or  mystified, or elated, at anything his sister-in-law might have done  or have failed to do. Mrs. Ludlow's mental motions were sufficiently  various. At one moment she thought it would be so natural for that young  woman to come home and take a house in New York--the Rossiters', for  instance, which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the  corner from her own; at another she couldn't conceal her surprise at the  girl's not marrying some member of one of the great aristocracies. On  the whole, as I have said, she had fallen from high communion with the  probabilities. She had taken more satisfaction in Isabel's accession of  fortune than if the money had been left to herself; it had seemed to her  to offer just the proper setting for her sister's slightly meagre, but  scarce the less eminent figure. Isabel had developed less, however, than  Lily had thought likely--development, to Lily's understanding, being  somehow mysteriously connected with morning-calls and evening-parties.  Intellectually, doubtless, she had made immense strides; but she  appeared to have achieved few of those social conquests of which Mrs.  Ludlow had expected to admire the trophies. Lily's conception of such  achievements was extremely vague; but this was exactly what she had  expected of Isabel--to give it form and body. Isabel could have done  as well as she had done in New York; and Mrs. Ludlow appealed to her  husband to know whether there was any privilege she enjoyed in Europe  which the society of that city might not offer her. We know ourselves  that Isabel had made conquests--whether inferior or not to those she  might have effected in her native land it would be a delicate matter to  decide; and it is not altogether with a feeling of complacency that  I again mention that she had not rendered these honourable victories  public. She had not told her sister the history of Lord Warburton, nor  had she given her a hint of Mr. Osmond's state of mind; and she had had  no better reason for her silence than that she didn't wish to speak.  It was more romantic "]]]
