Thus armed, they gave us sure footing on  soft snow slopes, and were particularly useful in ascending the glacier.  While thus occupied at the base camp, came an Indian, his wife and  child, all the way from Lake Minchumina, perhaps one hundred miles'  journey, to have the child baptized. It was generally known amongst all  the natives of the region that the enterprise was on foot, and  \"Minchumina John,\" hoping to meet us in the Kantishna, and missing us,  had followed our trail thus far. It was interesting to speculate how  much further he would have penetrated: Walter thought as far as the  glacier, but I think he would have followed as far as the dogs could go  or until food was quite exhausted.    [Illustration: The base camp at about 4,000 feet on Cache Creek.    The Muldrow Glacier flows between the ridge in the background and the  peak just beyond it.]    Meanwhile, the relaying of the supplies and the wood to the base camp  had gone on, and the advancing of it to a cache at the pass by which we  should gain the Muldrow Glacier. On 15th April Esaias and one of the  teams were sent back to Nenana. Almost all the stuff we should move was  already at this cache, and the need for the two dog teams was over.  Moreover, the trails were rapidly breaking up, and it was necessary for  the boy to travel by night instead of by day on his return trip. Johnny  and the other dog team we kept, because we designed to use the dogs up  to the head of the glacier, and the boy to keep the base camp and tend  the dogs, when this was done, until our return. So we said good-by to  Esaias, and he took out the last word that was received from us in more  than two months.    [Sidenote: McPhee Pass]    The photograph of the base camp shows a mountainous ridge stretching  across much of the background. That ridge belongs to the outer wall of  the Muldrow Glacier and indicates its general direction. Just beyond the  picture, to the right, the ridge breaks down, and the little valley in  the middle distance sweeps around, becomes a steep, narrow gulch, and  ends at the breach in the glacier wall. This breach, thus reached, is  the pass which the Kantishna miners of the \"pioneer\" expedition  discovered and named \"McPhee Pass,\" after a Fairbanks saloon-keeper. The  name should stand. There is no other pass by which the glacier can be  reached; certainly none at all above, and probably no convenient one  below. Unless this pass were used, it would be necessary to make the  long and difficult journey to the snout of the glacier, some twenty  miles farther to the east, cross its rough terminal moraine, and  traverse all its lower stretch.    On the 11th April Karstens and I wound our way up the narrow, steep  defile for about three miles from the base camp and came to our first  sight of the Muldrow Glacier, some two thousand five hundred feet above  camp and six thousand, three hundred feet above the sea. That day stands  out in recollection as one of the notable days of the whole ascent.  There the glacier stretched away, broad and level--the road to the heart  of the mountain, and as our eyes traced its course our spirits leaped up  that at last we were entered upon our real task. One of us, at least,  knew something of the dangers and difficulties its apparently smooth  surface concealed, yet to both of us it had an infinite attractiveness,  for it was the highway of desire.          CHAPTER II    THE MULDROW GLACIER      Right opposite McPhee Pass, across the glacier, perhaps at this point  half a mile wide, rises a bold pyramidal peak, twelve thousand or  thirteen thousand feet high, which we would like to name Mount Farthing,  in honor of the memory of a very noble gentlewoman who died at the  mission at Nenana three years ago, unless, unknown to us, it already  bear some other name.[1] Walter and our two Indian boys had been under  her instruction.    At the base of this peak two branches of the glacier unite, coming down  in the same general direction and together draining the snows of the  whole eastern face of the mountain. The dividing wall between them,  almost up to their head and termination, is one stupendous, well-nigh  vertical escarpment of ice-covered rock towering six thousand or seven  thousand feet above the glacier floor, the first of the very impressive  features of the mountain. The other wall of the glacier, through a  breach in which we reached its surface--the right-hand wall as we  journeyed up it--consists of a series of inaccessible cliffs deeply  seamed with snow gullies and crusted here and there with hanging  glaciers, the rock formation changing several times as one proceeds but  maintaining an unbroken rampart.    Now, it is important to remember that these two ridges which make the  walls of the Muldrow Glacier rise ultimately to the two summits of the  mountain, the right-hand wall culminating in the North Peak and the  left-hand wall in the South Peak. And the glacier lies between the walls  all the way up and separates the summits, with this qualification--that  midway in its course it is interrupted by a perpendicular ice-fall of  about four thousand feet by which its upper portion discharges into its  lower. It will help the reader to a comprehension of the ascent if this  rough sketch be borne in mind.    [Illustration: The Muldrow Glacier. Karstens in the foreground.]    The course of the glacier at the point at which we reached it is nearly  northeast and southwest (magnetic); its surface is almost level and it  is free of crevasses save at its sides. For three or four miles above  the pass it pursues its course without change of direction or much  increase in grade; then it takes a broad sweep toward the south and  grows steep and much crevassed. Three miles farther up it takes another  and more decided southerly bend, receiving two steep but short  tributaries from the northwest at an elevation of about ten thousand  feet, and finishing its lower course in another mile and a half, at an  elevation of about eleven thousand five hundred feet, with an almost due  north and south direction (magnetic).    A week after our first sight of the glacier, or on the 18th April, we  were camped at about the farthest point we had been able to see on that  occasion--just round the first bend. Our stuff had been freighted to the  pass and cached there; then, in the usual method of our advance, the  camp had been moved forward beyond the cache on to the glacier, a full  day's march. Then the team worked backward, bringing up the stuff to the  new camp. Thus three could go ahead, prospecting and staking out a trail  for further advance, while two worked with the dog team at the  freighting.    [Sidenote: Crevasses]    For the glacier difficulties now confronted us in the fullest degree.  Immediately above our tent the ice rose steeply a couple of hundred  feet, and at that level began to be most intricately crevassed. It took  several days to unravel the tangle of fissures and discover and prepare  a trail that the dogs could haul the sleds along. Sometimes a bridge  would be found over against one wall of the glacier, and for the next we  might have to go clear across to the other wall. Sometimes a block of  ice jammed in the jaws of a crevasse would make a perfectly safe bridge;  sometimes we had nothing upon which to cross save hardened snow. Some of  the gaps were narrow and some wide, yawning chasms. Some of them were  mere surface cracks and some gave hundreds of feet of deep blue ice with  no bottom visible at all. Sometimes there was no natural bridge over a  crevasse, and then, choosing the narrowest and shallowest place in it,  we made a bridge, excavating blocks of hard snow with the shovels and  building them up from a ledge below, or projecting them on the  cantilever principle, one beyond the other from both sides. Many of  these crevasses could be jumped across by an unencumbered man on his  snow-shoes that could not have been jumped with a pack and that the dogs  could not cross at all. As each section of trail was determined it was  staked out with willow shoots, hundreds of which had been brought up  from below. And in all of this pioneering work, and, indeed,  thenceforward invariably, the rope was conscientiously used. Every step  of the way up the glacier was sounded by a long pole, the man in the  lead thrusting it deep into the snow while the two behind kept the rope  always taut. More than one pole slipped into a hidden crevasse and was  lost when vigor of thrust was not matched by tenacity of grip; more than  once a man was jerked back just as the snow gave way beneath his feet.  The open crevasses were not the dangerous ones; the whole glacier was  crisscrossed by crevasses completely covered with snow. In bright  weather it was often possible to detect them by a slight depression in  the surface or by a faint, shadowy difference in tint, but in the  half-light of cloudy and misty weather these signs failed, and there was  no safety but in the ceaseless prodding of the pole. The ice-axe will  not serve--one cannot reach far enough forward with it for safety, and  the incessant stooping is an unnecessary added fatigue.    [Sidenote: Heavy Hauling]    For the transportation of our wood and supplies beyond the first glacier  camp, the team of six dogs was cut into two teams of three, each drawing  a little Yukon sled procured in the Kantishna, the large basket sled  having been abandoned. And in the movement forward, when the trail to a  convenient cache had been established, two men, roped together,  accompanied each sled, one ahead of the dogs, the other just behind the  dogs at the gee-pole. This latter had also a hauling-line looped about  his breast, so that men and dogs and sled made a unit. It took the  combined traction power of men and dogs to take the loads up the steep  glacial ascents, and it was very hard work.

Don't think it.\"    \"I am glad,\" said Psmith courteously. \"For, speaking as man to man,  I must confess that for sheer, concentrated bilge she gets away  with the biscuit with almost insolent ease. Luella Granville  Waterman must go.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"She must go,\" repeated Psmith firmly. \"Your first act, now that  you have swiped the editorial chair, must be to sack her.\"    \"But, say, I can't. The editor thinks a heap of her stuff.\"    \"We cannot help his troubles. We must act for the good of the  paper. Moreover, you said, I think, that he was away?\"    \"So he is. But he'll come back.\"    \"Sufficient unto the day, Comrade Windsor. I have a suspicion that  he will be the first to approve your action. His holiday will have  cleared his brain. Make a note of improvement number one--the  sacking of Luella Granville Waterman.\"    \"I guess it'll be followed pretty quick by improvement number  two--the sacking of William Windsor. I can't go monkeying about  with the paper that way.\"    Psmith reflected for a moment.    \"Has this job of yours any special attractions for you, Comrade  Windsor?\"    \"I guess not.\"    \"As I suspected. You yearn for scope. What exactly are your  ambitions?\"    \"I want to get a job on one of the big dailies. I don't see how  I'm going to fix it, though, at the present rate.\"    Psmith rose, and tapped him earnestly on the chest.    \"Comrade Windsor, you have touched the spot. You are wasting the  golden hours of your youth. You must move. You must hustle. You  must make Windsor of _Cosy Moments_ a name to conjure with. You must  boost this sheet up till New York rings with your exploits. On the  present lines that is impossible. You must strike out a line for  yourself. You must show the world that even _Cosy Moments_ cannot  keep a good man down.\"    He resumed his seat.    \"How do you mean?\" said Billy Windsor.    Psmith turned to Mike.    \"Comrade Jackson, if you were editing this paper, is there a single  feature you would willingly retain?\"    \"I don't think there is,\" said Mike. \"It's all pretty bad rot.\"    \"My opinion in a nutshell,\" said Psmith, approvingly. \"Comrade  Jackson,\" he explained, turning to Billy, \"has a secure reputation  on the other side for the keenness and lucidity of his views upon  literature. You may safely build upon him. In England when Comrade  Jackson says 'Turn' we all turn. Now, my views on the matter are as  follows. _Cosy Moments_, in my opinion (worthless, were it not backed  by such a virtuoso as Comrade Jackson), needs more snap, more go.  All these putrid pages must disappear. Letters must be despatched  to-morrow morning, informing Luella Granville Waterman and the  others (and in particular B. Henderson Asher, who from a cursory  glance strikes me as an ideal candidate for a lethal chamber) that,  unless they cease their contributions instantly, you will be  compelled to place yourself under police protection. After that we  can begin to move.\"    Billy Windsor sat and rocked himself in his chair without replying.  He was trying to assimilate this idea. So far the grandeur of it  had dazed him. It was too spacious, too revolutionary. Could it be  done? It would undoubtedly mean the sack when Mr. J. Fillken  Wilberfloss returned and found the apple of his eye torn asunder  and, so to speak, deprived of its choicest pips. On the other hand  . . . His brow suddenly cleared. After all, what was the sack? One  crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name, and  he would have no name as long as he clung to his present position.  The editor would be away ten weeks. He would have ten weeks in  which to try himself out. Hope leaped within him. In ten weeks he  could change _Cosy Moments_ into a real live paper. He wondered that  the idea had not occurred to him before. The trifling fact that the  despised journal was the property of Mr. Benjamin White, and that  he had no right whatever to tinker with it without that gentleman's  approval, may have occurred to him, but, if it did, it occurred so  momentarily that he did not notice it. In these crises one cannot  think of everything.    \"I'm on,\" he said, briefly.    Psmith smiled approvingly.    \"That,\" he said, \"is the right spirit. You will, I fancy, have  little cause to regret your decision. Fortunately, if I may say so,  I happen to have a certain amount of leisure just now. It is at  your disposal. I have had little experience of journalistic work,  but I foresee that I shall be a quick learner. I will become your  sub-editor, without salary.\"    \"Bully for you,\" said Billy Windsor.    \"Comrade Jackson,\" continued Psmith, \"is unhappily more fettered.  The exigencies of his cricket tour will compel him constantly to be  gadding about, now to Philadelphia, now to Saskatchewan, anon to  Onehorseville, Ga. His services, therefore, cannot be relied upon  continuously. From him, accordingly, we shall expect little but  moral support. An occasional congratulatory telegram. Now and then  a bright smile of approval. The bulk of the work will devolve upon  our two selves.\"    \"Let it devolve,\" said Billy Windsor, enthusiastically.    \"Assuredly,\" said Psmith. \"And now to decide upon our main scheme.  You, of course, are the editor, and my suggestions are merely  suggestions, subject to your approval. But, briefly, my idea is  that _Cosy Moments_ should become red-hot stuff. I could wish its  tone to be such that the public will wonder why we do not print it  on asbestos. We must chronicle all the live events of the day,  murders, fires, and the like in a manner which will make our  readers' spines thrill. Above all, we must be the guardians of the  People's rights. We must be a search-light, showing up the dark  spot in the souls of those who would endeavour in any way to do the  PEOPLE in the eye. We must detect the wrong-doer, and deliver him  such a series of resentful buffs that he will abandon his little  games and become a model citizen. The details of the campaign we  must think out after, but I fancy that, if we follow those main  lines, we shall produce a bright, readable little sheet which will  in a measure make this city sit up and take notice. Are you with  me, Comrade Windsor?\"    \"Surest thing you know,\" said Billy with fervour.        CHAPTER VI    THE TENEMENTS    To alter the scheme of a weekly from cover to cover is not a task  that is completed without work. The dismissal of _Cosy Moments_'  entire staff of contributors left a gap in the paper which had to be  filled, and owing to the nearness of press day there was no time to  fill it before the issue of the next number. The editorial staff had  to be satisfied with heading every page with the words \"Look out!  Look out!! Look out!!! See foot of page!!!!\" printing in the space  at the bottom the legend, \"Next Week! See Editorial!\" and compiling  in conjunction a snappy editorial, setting forth the proposed  changes. This was largely the work of Psmith.    \"Comrade Jackson,\" he said to Mike, as they set forth one evening  in search of their new flat, \"I fancy I have found my metier.  Commerce, many considered, was the line I should take; and  doubtless, had I stuck to that walk in life, I should soon have  become a financial magnate. But something seemed to whisper to me,  even in the midst of my triumphs in the New Asiatic Bank, that  there were other fields. For the moment it seems to me that I have  found the job for which nature specially designed me. At last I  have Scope. And without Scope, where are we? Wedged tightly in  among the ribstons. There are some very fine passages in that  editorial. The last paragraph, beginning '_Cosy Moments_ cannot be  muzzled,' in particular. I like it. It strikes the right note. It  should stir the blood of a free and independent people till they  sit in platoons on the doorstep of our office, waiting for the next  number to appear.\"    \"How about that next number?\" asked Mike. \"Are you and Windsor  going to fill the whole paper yourselves?\"    \"By no means. It seems that Comrade Windsor knows certain stout  fellows, reporters on other papers, who will be delighted to weigh  in with stuff for a moderate fee.\"    \"How about Luella What's-her-name and the others? How have they  taken it?\"    \"Up to the present we have no means of ascertaining. The letters  giving them the miss-in-baulk in no uncertain voice were only  despatched yesterday. But it cannot affect us how they writhe  beneath the blow. There is no reprieve.\"    Mike roared with laughter.    \"It's the rummiest business I ever struck,\" he said. \"I'm jolly  glad it's not my paper. It's pretty lucky for you two lunatics that  the proprietor's in Europe.\"    Psmith regarded him with pained surprise.    \"I do not understand you, Comrade Jackson. Do you insinuate that  we are not acting in the proprietor's best interests? When he sees  the receipts, after we have handled the paper for a while, he will  go singing about his hotel. His beaming smile will be a by-word in  Carlsbad. Visitors will be shown it as one of the sights. His only  doubt will be whether to send his money to the bank or keep it in  tubs and roll in it. We are on to a big thing, Comrade Jackson.  Wait till you see our first number.\"    \"And how about the editor? I should think that first number would  bring him back foaming at the mouth.\"    \"I have ascertained from Comrade Windsor that there is nothing to  fear from that quarter. By a singular stroke of good fortune  Comrade Wilberfloss--his name is Wilberfloss--has been ordered  complete rest during his holiday. The kindly medico, realising the  fearful strain inflicted by reading _Cosy Moments_ in its old form,  specifically mentioned that the paper was to be withheld from him  until "]]]
