Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of  ground water and air when not properly disposed.    Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.  Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than it  can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant cover, a  common effect of too many animals grazing limited range land.    Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living  organisms.    Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern with  respect to endangered or threatened species.    Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made  waste.    Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.    Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water becomes  salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse process;  also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused by  evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.    Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.    Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in which  trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for temporary  agriculture; the land is used until its productivity declines at which  point a new plot is selected and the process repeats; this practice is  sustainable while population levels are low and time is permitted for  regrowth of natural vegetation; conversely, where these conditions do  not exist, the practice can have disastrous consequences for the  environment.    Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because of  poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of pesticides or  fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or erosion of  topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to produce  agricultural products.    Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation, overgrazing,  and desertification.    Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy  emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by  the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and  has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.  Water-born diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are  transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an  untreated water supply.      Environment - international agreements:  This entry separates country  participation in international environmental agreements into two levels  - party to and signed, but not ratified. Agreements are listed in  alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.    Environmental agreements:  This information is presented in Appendix C:  Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the  name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into force,  objective, and parties by category.    Ethnic groups:  This entry provides an ordered listing of ethnic groups  starting with the largest and normally includes the percent of total  population.    Exchange rates:  This entry provides the official value of a country's  monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as  expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined by  international market forces or official fiat.    Executive branch:  This entry includes several subfields. Chief of  state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country  who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may  not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head  of government includes the name and title of the top administrative  leader who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the  government. For example, in the UK, the monarch is the chief of state,  and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, the  president is both the chief of state and the head of government.  Cabinet includes the official name for this body of high-ranking  advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections includes  the nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last  election, and date of the next election. Election results includes the  percent of vote for each candidate in the last election.    Exports:  This entry provides the total US dollar amount of merchandise  exports on an f.o.b. (free on board) basis. These figures are  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in purchasing power  parity (PPP) terms.    Exports - commodities:  This entry provides a rank ordering of exported  products starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the  percent of total dollar value.    Exports - partners:  This entry provides a rank ordering of trading  partners starting with the most important; it sometimes includes the  percent of total dollar value.    Fiscal year:  This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for  a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar  year but which may begin in any month. All yearly references are for  the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year  (FY).    Flag description:  This entry provides a written flag description  produced from actual flags or the best information available at the  time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used by  their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag.  Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.    Flag graphic:  Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at  the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced  from actual flags or the best information available at the time of  preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their  dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some  disputed and other areas do not have flags.    GDP (official exchange rate):  This entry gives the gross domestic  product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within  a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at offical exchange rates  (OER) is the home-currency-denominated annual GDP figure divided by the  bilateral average US exchange rate with that country in that year. The  measure is simple to compute and gives a precise measure of the value  of output. Many economists prefer this measure when gauging the  economic power an economy maintains vis-a-vis its neighbors, judging  that an exchange rate captures the purchasing power a nation enjoys in  the international marketplace. Official exchange rates, however, can be  artifically fixed and/or subject to manipulation - resulting in claims  of the country having an under- or over-valued currency - and are not  necessarily the equivalent of a market-determined exchange rate.  Moreover, even if the official exchange rate is market-determined,  market exchange rates are frequently established by a relatively small  set of goods and services (the ones the country trades) and may not  capture the value of the larger set of goods the country produces.  Furthermore, OER-converted GDP is not well suited to comparing domestic  GDP over time, since appreciation/depreciation from one year to the  next will make the OER GDP value rise/fall regardless of whether home-  currency-denominated GDP changed.    GDP (purchasing power parity):  This entry gives the gross domestic  product (GDP) or value of all final goods and services produced within  a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity  (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services  produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United  States. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-  capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources  across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar  value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country  regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent  in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US  military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are  based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In  addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World  Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP  estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing  countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official  exchange rate (OER) measure. The difference between the OER- and PPP-  denominated GDP values for most of the weathly industrialized countries  are generally much smaller.    GDP - composition by sector:  This entry gives the percentage  contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP. The  distribution will total less than 100 percent if the data are  incomplete.    GDP - per capita (PPP):  This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power  parity basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.    GDP - real growth rate:  This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis  adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2735"],[0,"The Golden Dog (#5)"],[1,"man he is too, for with his ships and  his comptoirs and his ledgers he has traded himself into being the  richest man in New France, while we, with our nobility and our swords,  have fought ourselves poor, and receive nothing but contempt from the  ungrateful courtiers of Versailles.\"    Their conversation was interrupted by a sudden rush of people, making  room for the passage of the Regiment of Bearn, which composed part  of the garrison of Quebec, on their march to their morning drill and  guard-mounting,--bold, dashing Gascons in blue and white uniforms, tall  caps, and long queues rollicking down their supple backs, seldom seen by  an enemy.    Mounted officers, laced and ruffled, gaily rode in front. Subalterns  with spontoons and sergeants with halberds dressed the long line of  glistening bayonets. The drums and fifes made the streets ring again,  while the men in full chorus, a gorge deployee, chanted the gay refrain  of La Belle Canadienne in honor of the lasses of Quebec.    The Governor and his suite had already mounted their horses, and  cantered off to the Esplanade to witness the review.    \"Come and dine with us today,\" said the Lady de Tilly to La Corne St.  Luc, as he too bade the ladies a courteous adieu, and got on horseback  to ride after the Governor.    \"Many thanks! but I fear it will be impossible, my Lady: the council  of war meets at the Castle this afternoon. The hour may be deferred,  however, should Colonel Philibert not chance to find the Intendant at  Beaumanoir, and then I might come; but best not expect me.\"    A slight, conscious flush just touched the cheek of Amelie at the  mention of Colonel Philibert.    \"But come if possible, godfather,\" added she; \"we hope to have Le  Gardeur home this afternoon. He loves you so much, and I know you have  countless things to say to him.\"    Amelie's trembling anxiety about her brother made her most desirous to  bring the powerful influence of La Corne St. Luc to bear upon him.    Their kind old godfather was regarded with filial reverence by both.  Amelie's father, dying on the battle-field, had, with his latest breath,  commended the care of his children to the love and friendship of La  Corne St. Luc.    \"Well, Amelie, blessed are they who do not promise and still perform.  I must try and meet my dear boy, so do not quite place me among the  impossibles. Good-by, my Lady. Good-by, Amelie.\" The old soldier gaily  kissed his hand and rode away.    Amelie was thoroughly surprised and agitated out of all composure by the  news of the return of Pierre Philibert. She turned aside from the  busy throng that surrounded her, leaving her aunt engaged in eager  conversation with the Bishop and Father de Berey. She sat down in a  quiet embrasure of the wall, and with one hand resting her drooping  cheek, a train of reminiscences flew across her mind like a flight of  pure doves suddenly startled out of a thicket.    She remembered vividly Pierre Philibert, the friend and fellow-student  of her brother: he spent so many of his holidays at the old Manor-House  of Tilly, when she, a still younger girl, shared their sports, wove  chaplets of flowers for them, or on her shaggy pony rode with them on  many a scamper through the wild woods of the Seigniory. Those summer and  winter vacations of the old Seminary of Quebec used to be looked forward  to by the young, lively girl as the brightest spots in the whole year,  and she grew hardly to distinguish the affection she bore her brother  from the regard in which she held Pierre Philibert.    A startling incident happened one day, that filled the inmates of the  Manor House with terror, followed by a great joy, and which raised  Pierre Philibert to the rank of an unparalleled hero in the imagination  of the young girl.    Her brother was gambolling carelessly in a canoe, while she and Pierre  sat on the bank watching him. The light craft suddenly upset. Le Gardeur  struggled for a few moments, and sank under the blue waves that look so  beautiful and are so cruel.    Amelie shrieked in the wildest terror and in helpless agony, while  Philibert rushed without hesitation into the water, swam out to the  spot, and dived with the agility of a beaver. He presently reappeared,  bearing the inanimate body of her brother to the shore. Help was  soon obtained, and, after long efforts to restore Le Gardeur to  consciousness,--efforts which seemed to last an age to the despairing  girl,--they at last succeeded, and Le Gardeur was restored to the  arms of his family. Amelie, in a delirium of joy and gratitude, ran to  Philibert, threw her arms round him, and kissed him again and again,  pledging her eternal gratitude to the preserver of her brother, and  vowing that she would pray for him to her life's end.    Soon after that memorable event in her young life, Pierre Philibert was  sent to the great military schools in France to study the art of war  with a view to entering the King's service, while Amelie was placed in  the Convent of the Ursulines to be perfected in all the knowledge and  accomplishments of a lady of highest rank in the Colony.    Despite the cold shade of a cloister, where the idea of a lover is  forbidden to enter, the image of Pierre Philibert did intrude, and  became inseparable from the recollection of her brother in the mind  of Amelie. He mingled as the fairy prince in the day-dreams and bright  imaginings of the young, poetic girl. She had vowed to pray for him to  her life's end, and in pursuance of her vow added a golden bead to  her chaplet to remind her of her duty in praying for the safety and  happiness of Pierre Philibert.    But in the quiet life of the cloister, Amelie heard little of the storms  of war upon the frontier and down in the far valleys of Acadia. She had  not followed the career of Pierre from the military school to the camp  and the battlefield, nor knew of his rapid promotion, as one of the  ablest officers in the King's service, to a high command in his native  Colony.    Her surprise, therefore, was extreme when she learned that the boy  companion of her brother and herself was no other than the renowned  Colonel Philibert, Aide-de-Camp of His Excellency the Governor-General.    There was no cause for shame in it; but her heart was suddenly  illuminated by a flash of introspection. She became painfully conscious  how much Pierre Philibert had occupied her thoughts for years, and now  all at once she knew he was a man, and a great and noble one. She was  thoroughly perplexed and half angry. She questioned herself sharply, as  if running thorns into her flesh, to inquire whether she had failed in  the least point of maidenly modesty and reserve in thinking so much of  him; and the more she questioned herself, the more agitated she grew  under her self-accusation: her temples throbbed violently; she hardly  dared lift her eyes from the ground lest some one, even a stranger, she  thought, might see her confusion and read its cause. \"Sancta Maria,\"  she murmured, pressing her bosom with both hands, \"calm my soul with thy  divine peace, for I know not what to do!\"    So she sat alone in the embrasure, living a life of emotion in a few  minutes; nor did she find any calm for her agitated spirits until the  thought flashed upon her that she was distressing herself needlessly. It  was most improbable that Colonel Philibert, after years of absence and  active life in the world's great affairs, could retain any recollection  of the schoolgirl of the Manor House of Tilly. She might meet him, nay,  was certain to do so in the society in which both moved; but it would  surely be as a stranger on his part, and she must make it so on her own.    With this empty piece of casuistry, Amelie, like others of her sex,  placed a hand of steel, encased in a silken glove, upon her heart,  and tyrannically suppressed its yearnings. She was a victim, with the  outward show of conquest over her feelings. In the consciousness of  Philibert's imagined indifference and utter forgetfulness, she could  meet him now, she thought, with equanimity--nay, rather wished to do so,  to make sure that she had not been guilty of weakness in regard to  him. She looked up, but was glad to see her aunt still engaged in  conversation with the Bishop on a topic which Amelie knew was dear to  them both,--the care of the souls and bodies of the poor, in particular  those for whom the Lady de Tilly felt herself responsible to God and the  King.    While Amelie sat thinking over the strange chances of the morning, a  sudden whirl of wheels drew her attention.    A gay caleche, drawn by two spirited horses en fleche, dashed through  the gateway of St. John, and wheeling swiftly towards Amelie, suddenly  halted. A young lady attired in the gayest fashion of the period,  throwing the reins to the groom, sprang out of the caleche with the ease  and elasticity of an antelope. She ran up the rampart to Amelie with a  glad cry of recognition, repeating her name in a clear, musical voice,  which Amelie at once knew belonged to no other than the gay, beautiful  Angelique des Meloises. The newcomer embraced Amelie and kissed her,  with warmest expressions of joy at meeting her thus unexpectedly in the  city. She had learned that Lady de Tilly had returned to Quebec, she  said, and she had, therefore, taken the earliest opportunity to find  out her dear friend and school-fellow to tell her all the doings in the  city.    \"It is kind of you, Angelique,\" replied Amelie, returning her caress  warmly, but without effusion. \"We have simply come with our people  to assist in the King's corvee; when that is done, we shall return to  Tilly. I felt sure I should meet you, and thought I should know you  again easily, which I hardly do. How you are changed--for the better, I  should say, since you left off conventual cap and costume!\" Amelie could  not but look admiringly on the beauty of the radiant girl. \"How handsome  you"]]]
