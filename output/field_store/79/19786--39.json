By Baal, the cities, though well built,      Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what      Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule,      But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record.      Why, those few lines contain the history      Of all things human: hear--\"Sardanapalus,      The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,                                250      In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus.      Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip.\"[10]        _Sal._ A worthy moral, and a wise inscription,      For a king to put up before his subjects!        _Sar._ Oh, thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--      \"Obey the king--contribute to his treasure--      Recruit his phalanx--spill your blood at bidding--      Fall down and worship, or get up and toil.\"      Or thus--\"Sardanapalus on this spot      Slew fifty thousand of his enemies.                                260      These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy.\"      I leave such things to conquerors; enough      For me, if I can make my subjects feel      The weight of human misery less, and glide      Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license      Which I deny to them. We all are men.        _Sal._ Thy Sires have been revered as Gods--        _Sar._                                        In dust      And death, where they are neither Gods nor men.      Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods;[11]      At least they banqueted upon your Gods,                            270      And died for lack of farther nutriment.      Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--      I feel a thousand mortal things about me,      But nothing godlike,--unless it may be      The thing which you condemn, a disposition      To love and to be merciful, to pardon      The follies of my species, and (that's human)      To be indulgent to my own.        _Sal._                    Alas!      The doom of Nineveh is sealed.--Woe--woe      To the unrivalled city!        _Sar._                  What dost dread?                           280        _Sal._ Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours      The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee,      And thine and mine; and in another day      What _is_ shall be the past of Belus' race.        _Sar._ What must we dread?        _Sal._                    Ambitious treachery,      Which has environed thee with snares; but yet      There is resource: empower me with thy signet      To quell the machinations, and I lay      The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.        _Sar._ The heads--how many?        _Sal._                     Must I stay to number             290      When even thine own's in peril? Let me go;      Give me thy signet--trust me with the rest.        _Sar._ I will trust no man with unlimited lives.      When we take those from others, we nor know      What we have taken, nor the thing we give.        _Sal._ Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?        _Sar._ That's a hard question--But I answer, Yes.      Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they      Whom thou suspectest?--Let them be arrested.        _Sal._ I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment            300      Will send my answer through thy babbling troop      Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace,      Even to the city, and so baffle all.--      Trust me.        _Sar._      Thou knowest I have done so ever;      Take thou the signet.                             [_Gives the signet_.        _Sal._                I have one more request.        _Sar._ Name it.        _Sal._           That thou this night forbear the banquet      In the pavilion over the Euphrates.        _Sar._ Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters      That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come,      And do their worst: I shall not blench for them;                   310      Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet;      Nor crown me with a single rose the less;      Nor lose one joyous hour.--I fear them not.        _Sal._ But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?        _Sar._ Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and      A sword of such a temper, and a bow,      And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth:      A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy.      And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them,      Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?                   320        _Sal._ Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--      If need be, wilt thou wear them?        _Sar._                           Will I not?      Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves      Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword      Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.        _Sal._ They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.        _Sar._ That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks,      Of whom our captives often sing, related      The same of their chief hero, Hercules,      Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest                        330      The populace of all the nations seize      Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.        _Sal._ They did not speak thus of thy fathers.        _Sar._                                         No;      They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat;      And never changed their chains but for their armour:      Now they have peace and pastime, and the license      To revel and to rail; it irks me not.      I would not give the smile of one fair girl      For all the popular breath[12] that e'er divided      A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues[13]                 340      Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding,      That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread      Their noisome clamour?        _Sal._                 You have said they are men;      As such their hearts are something.        _Sar._                              So my dogs' are;      And better, as more faithful:--but, proceed;      Thou hast my signet:--since they are tumultuous,      Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till      Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain,      Given or received; we have enough within us,      The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,                        350      Not to add to each other's natural burthen      Of mortal misery, but rather lessen,      By mild reciprocal alleviation,      The fatal penalties imposed on life:      But this they know not, or they will not know.      I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them:      I made no wars, I added no new imposts,      I interfered not with their civic lives,      I let them pass their days as best might suit them,      Passing my own as suited me.        _Sal._                       Thou stopp'st                         360      Short of the duties of a king; and therefore      They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.        _Sar._ They lie.--Unhappily, I am unfit      To be aught save a monarch; else for me      The meanest Mede might be the king instead.        _Sal._ There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so.        _Sar._ What mean'st thou!--'tis thy secret; thou desirest      Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature.      Take the fit steps; and, since necessity      Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er                       370      Was man who more desired to rule in peace      The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better      They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes,      \"The Mighty Hunter!\" I will turn these realms      To one wide desert chase of brutes, who _were_,      But _would_ no more, by their own choice, be human.      _What_ they have found me, they belie; _that which_      They yet may find me--shall defy their wish      To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.        _Sal._ Then thou at last canst feel?        _Sar._                              Feel! who feels not            380      Ingratitude?[14]        _Sal._      I will not pause to answer      With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy      Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee,      And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign,      As powerful in thy realm. Farewell!                 [_Exit_ SALEMENES.        _Sar._ (_solus_).                 Farewell!      He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet,      Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern      As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve      To feel a master. What may be the danger,      I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it.                    390      Must I consume my life--this little life--      In guarding against all may make it less?      It is not worth so much! It were to die      Before my hour, to live in dread of death,      Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me,      Because they are near; and all who are remote,      Because they are far. But if it should be so--      If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire,      Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth?      I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image;                  400      To die is no less natural than those      Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed      Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till      My name became the synonyme of Death--      A terror and a trophy. But for this      I feel no penitence; my life is love:      If I must shed blood, it shall be by force.      Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein      Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin      Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished             "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2348"],[0,"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax (#5)"],[1," and spiritual woman of middle age.  In an  instant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a  sitting position.    \"Is she gone, Watson?  Is there a spark left?  Surely we are not too  late!\"    For half an hour it seemed that we were.  What with actual suffocation,  and what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances  seemed to have passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with  artificial respiration, with injected ether, and with every device that  science could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the  eyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life.  A cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it.  \"Here is Lestrade with his warrant,\" said he.  \"He will find that his  birds have flown.  And here,\" he added as a heavy step hurried along  the passage, \"is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than  we have.  Good morning, Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move  the Lady Frances the better. Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and  the poor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last  resting-place alone.\"    \"Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,\" said  Holmes that evening, \"it can only be as an example of that temporary  eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed.  Such  slips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can  recognize and repair them.  To this modified credit I may, perhaps,  make some claim.  My night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a  clue, a strange sentence, a curious observation, had come under my  notice and had been too easily dismissed.  Then, suddenly, in the gray  of the morning, the words came back to me.  It was the remark of the  undertaker's wife, as reported by Philip Green.  She had said, 'It  should be there before now.  It took longer, being out of the  ordinary.'  It was the coffin of which she spoke.  It had been out of  the ordinary. That could only mean that it had been made to some  special measurement.  But why?  Why?  Then in an instant I remembered  the deep sides, and the little wasted figure at the bottom.  Why so  large a coffin for so small a body?  To leave room for another body.  Both would be buried under the one certificate.  It had all been so  clear, if only my own sight had not been dimmed.  At eight the Lady  Frances would be buried.  Our one chance was to stop the coffin before  it left the house.    \"It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it WAS a  chance, as the result showed.  These people had never, to my knowledge,  done a murder.  They might shrink from actual violence at the last.  The could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she  were exhumed there was a chance for them.  I hoped that such  considerations might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene  well enough.  You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady  had been kept so long.  They rushed in and overpowered her with their  chloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to insure  against her waking, and then screwed down the lid.  A clever device,  Watson.  It is new to me in the annals of crime.  If our ex-missionary  friends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some  brilliant incidents in their future career.\""]]]
