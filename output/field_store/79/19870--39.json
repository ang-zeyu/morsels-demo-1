And when you get a  little of home-brewed Scotch into you, don't knock their head-dress  off.  They'll probably knife you.  It isn't a pleasant thing to get a  rusty blade stuck into your kidneys.  Bad for the health, I assure you.    \"Tell me something else you must not do?\" inquired the Colonel,  assuming the role of regimental schoolmaster.    \"They hate pigs, sir,\" said Sandy Brown.  \"When I wis a stoker on a  ship gaun East I flung a bit o' fried pork at a coolie.  He nearly  knocked ma lichts oot wi' a big hammer.\"    \"Yes, pigs are regarded by these fellows as unclean beasts.  To offer  them pork is, as Brown says, a great insult, so be careful of that.  Another important point is his carpet.  This is sacred.  He kneels on  that and offers up his prayers to Allah.  When you walk into his house,  don't wipe your feet and spit on it.  Give him a chance to remove it.  Can anyone tell me what those buildings in Cairo are with the big domes  on them?\"    \"Harems,\" piped Bill.    \"Chapels,\" said Doolan.    \"No, they are called mosques, or temples.  Watch what you do there.  Mohammedans always take off their shoes before entering.  Inside is  holy ground.  If you go into them you must put a pair of shoes over  your boots.  These are kept for the purpose.  Of course, don't walk  away with the shoes, or there will be trouble.  I have, also, a list  here of other things regarded as sacred either in the town or country.    \"Trees with rags tied to them.    \"Tombs.    \"Graveyards.    \"Deserted mosques.    \"Stones with inscriptions on them.    \"Fountains, and    \"Isolated clumps of trees on hill tops.    \"Be careful, now, of all these things.  They look nothing to you, but  they are very important to them.  You see, we are all Christians--or  supposed to be--and a Christian is regarded by them as an infidel and  son of a dog.    \"Next thing is the ladies.  We all love the ladies.  What do you know  about them?\" said the Colonel, suddenly pointing to a grinning youth.    \"And very nice too, sir,\" replied this youngster.    \"If it wasn't for their veils,\" said another.    \"Sure, sor, they've always a big, fat nigger trotting after them,\"  remarked Doolan.    \"Yes, Doolan, and be very careful of the big fellow behind.  He's what  is called a eunuch--a sort of guardian.  If you give these ladies the  'glad eye,' or attempt to touch them, he'll probably slit your throat  with a razor.  These women are veiled to all men except their husbands  and nearest relations.  Many of them are harem women.  Out here, a  native can have two or three wives and as many concubines as he likes.  For example, the late Khedive had about a hundred women in his harem,  and they say the Sultan of Turkey has over five hundred.  Some of these  women are very beautiful, others are quite ugly.  I heard of one man  who followed a veiled lady for about three miles, thinking she was some  wonderful Circassian beauty.  He managed to talk to her too, but when  she lifted her veil he was dumbstruck.  Instead of being young and  charming, she was old, haggard, toothless and revolting.  All is not  gold that glitters, and beauty is not always found beneath the veil.    \"Yes, that reminds me, I've been hearing of one or two queer things  which they say our fellows have been doing.  In a certain part of Cairo  the ladies of the harems frequently ride in carriages, taking the  evening air.  They often drive alone and use their eyes in the most  inviting way.  Some of our boys have jumped into the carriages and had  a most pleasant and interesting drive with these ladies.  That's risky,  men; don't do it.  It may come off ninety-nine times out of a hundred,  but on the hundredth occasion it may end in a knife and a bullet.  And  quite right too.  We have no right to interfere with the preserves of  an Egyptian Pasha.  Now I think that is all I have to say to you just  now.  Fall out, please.\"    When the Colonel had departed, the men formed up into little groups and  discussed some of the points that had been raised.    \"Old Sam's pulling our leg a bit about these holy places.  I ain't had  any bother, and I've found it quite a paying game digging up these old  niggers' bones.  Look here, boys, this is what I've found,\" said Sambo,  a big-boned bushman from Queensland, showing Bill and his cronies a  handful of old coins, rings and a bracelet.    \"Some curios!\" said Bill.    \"Worth money, too,\" remarked Sandy.    \"Where did you get them?\" asked Claud, his interest roused in these  wonderful old jewels of the East.    \"Down in the Dead City on the other side of Cairo--behind the Citadel.  I dig them up at nights.  I can give you a cargo of shin bones and  skulls if you want them.\"    \"Is it safe?\"    \"I reckon so.  You see, a lot of these are ancient graves.  Nobody has  a claim on them, so we can jump them.\"    \"Do you want some partners?\" asked Claud.    \"Yes, a few of us could get something.  I've had my eye on an old tomb  there for some time.\"    \"What about to-night?\"    \"That will do.  Bring your entrenching tools in a parcel, nobody sees  them.  We can get an old cab or motor to go in.\"    \"Right-ho!\" agreed Claud, who also arranged with Paddy, Bill and Sandy  to form part of the exploring squad.  This digging for ancient  treasures in the graves of the dead is an old game in Egypt.  It is  comparatively safe where there are no natives with an interest in the  business.  And it is really remarkable what interesting finds are made.  Rings, bangles, necklaces, brassware, beads, and jewels are often found  in these old graveyards.    The route to this particular place lay through Cairo.  It was already  dark when they started on a rattling old motor-car.  Down the Mena Road  they were whirled into the dazzling streets.  The traffic sent the car  slower through a long, narrow native quarter.  This was lined with  dirty shops, selling everything, from mouldy Turkish delight to  poisonous-looking firewater called native wine.  At the door of these  places the proud owners lounged on chairs or squatted on the ground,  haggling and dealing with the _fellah_ (the peasant Egyptian, and the  finest type in Egypt).  In Egypt everybody is in business.  You can  find merchants dealing in broken bottles, merchants in discarded  \"fags,\" merchants in the manure from the streets, merchants in rags and  bones, egg shells and cabbage stalks.  They'll do anything but work.  Work to an Easterner is designed for women and oxen.    Leaving the lighted streets behind, the motor at length turned round  into a long, darkened road.    \"This is the show,\" said Sambo, pointing to a wide field of little  domes, tombs, and broken-down buildings just visible in the murky light.    \"It's a gey queer place,\" said Sandy, with a tremor in his voice.    \"It is, and there's sure to be ghosts in this ould world?\" muttered  Mick, crossing himself.    \"There's diamonds, too--and tons of gold,\" remarked Claud.    \"Paddy, you'll be a rich man after to-night,\" laughed Sambo.    \"If I'm not a dead wan,\" said the Irishman, who, for the moment had  become seized with a dread of the supernatural.    \"Well, boys, here we are!\" exclaimed the leader of the party as they  neared a dark bend of the road.  \"Jump out!\"  The car was backed out of  sight, and the driver told to wait.    \"This way,\" and into the darkness plunged the Queenslander.  They  followed close at his heels, stumbling over graves, stones and old  enclosures.    \"What's that?\" screamed Paddy, as he kicked a white-looking thing at  his feet.    \"It's a skull, man,\" said Sandy, picking up the bleached headpiece of  an ancient.    \"Mother of Jasus, preserve us,\" murmured the Irishman, crossing himself  again.    \"Now, boys, here we are.  Get out your tools and start digging.  Here's  a little torch to use, now and again, to see what you've got.  You  fellows can pan out this show here, I'm going over a bit to do some  prospecting.\"    \"Right you are, I'll run this bit of the business,\" said Claud, as the  Queenslander went off into the darkness.   For a long time they picked  and shovelled out the soft brown earth.    \"What's this?\" whispered Sandy, holding something in his hand.  Claud  switched the light on.    \"It's a shin bone.\"    \"Here's the goods,\" shouted Bill, holding up a bracelet crusted with  earth and mildew.    \"It's gold, too,\" said Claud, fingering it.    \"And here's some quids,\" Paddy said, spreading some coins out in his  hand.    \"Coppers, you mean.\"    Resuming their task, they soon collected skulls, shin bones, thigh  bones, some old brassware, a ring, some coppers, and many other things  of an Eastern kind.    \"Wonderful!  Wonderful!\" soliloquised Claud, as he occasionally  surveyed the finds with the aid of his monocle and flash lamp.  But the  greatest find was a large brass urn of beautiful workmanship.    \"Looks like old Rameses' whisky jar,\" said Bill, turning the urn round  under the light of the lamp.    Things were really going well till the Irishman happened to look up.  His eyes at once caught a moving spectre of white advancing slowly  towards them.    \"Holy Mary, there's a ghost,\" said he, crossing himself and gripping  Claud by the arm.  They all looked up, and, sure enough, there was  something white and weird moving slowly across the plain of the dead.  Their eyes riveted on it.  Paddy muttered a prayer; Bill eloquently  wondered what the white thing was; Sandy, remarkably cool, picked up  the bracelet, coins and other trinkets and placed them in his pocket.  He did this, as he explained afterwards, \"in case the ghost wid get  them.\"    \"It's mighty funny,\" muttered Claud, frequently adjusting his eyeglass  to see the dread apparition more clearly.    \"It's a ghost, boys, I tell ye.  My ould father has seen them when he  lived in Kerry.  Heaven preserve us!\" he ejaculated, crossing himself  for about the fiftieth time.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#5)"],[1,"they were not even  asked by what name men knew them. Not caring to hear a name which might  not harmonize with their idea of the fitness of things, the cowboys of  the Bar-20 had, with a freedom born of excellent livers and fearless  temperaments, bestowed names befitting their sense of humor and  adaptability. The official title of the Sioux was By-and-by; the dog was  known as Fleas. Never had names more clearly described the objects to be  represented, for they were excellent examples of cowboy discernment and  aptitude.    In their eyes By-and-by was a man. He could feel and he could resent  insults. They did not class him as one of themselves, because he did not  have energy enough to demand and justify such classification. With them  he had a right to enjoy his life as he saw fit so long as he did not  trespass on or restrict the rights of others. They were not analytic  in temperament, neither were they moralists. He was not a menace to  society, because society had superb defenses. So they vaguely recognized  his many poor qualities and clearly saw his few good ones. He could  shoot, when permitted, with the best; no horse, however refractory, had  ever been known to throw him; he was an adept at following the trails  left by rustlers, and that was an asset; he became of value to the  community; he was an economic factor.    His ability to consume liquor with indifferent effects raised him  another notch in their estimation. He was not always talking when some  one else wished to--another count. There remained about him that stoical  indifference to the petty; that observant nonchalance of the Indian;  and there was a suggestion, faint, it was true, of a dignity common to  chieftains. He was a log of grave deference which tossed on their sea of  mischievous hilarity.    He wore a pair of corduroy trousers, known to the care-free as \"pants,\"  which were held together by numerous patches of what had once been  brilliantly colored calico. A pair of suspenders, torn into two separate  straps, made a belt for himself and a collar for his dog. The trousers  had probably been secured during a fit of absent-mindedness on his part  when their former owner had not been looking. Tucked at intervals in  the top of the corduroys (the exceptions making convenient shelves for  alkali dust) was what at one time had been a stiff-bosomed shirt. This  was open down the front and back, the weight of the trousers on the belt  holding it firmly on the square shoulders of the wearer, thus precluding  the necessity of collar buttons. A pair of moccasins, beautifully worked  with wampum, protected his feet from the onslaughts of cacti and the  inquisitive and pugnacious sand flies; and lying across his lap was  a repeating Winchester rifle, not dangerous because it was empty, a  condition due to the wisdom of the citizens in forbidding any one to  sell, trade or give to him those tubes of concentrated trouble, because  he could get drunk.    The two were contented and happy. They had no cares nor duties, and  their pleasures were simple and easily secured, as they consisted of  sleep and a proneness to avoid moving. Like the untrammeled coyote,  their bed was where sleep overtook them; their food, what the night  wrapped in a sense of security, or the generosity of the cowboys of the  Bar-20. No tub-ridden Diogenes ever knew so little of responsibility or  as much unadulterated content. There is a penalty even to civilization  and ambition.    When the sun had cast its shadows beyond By-and-by's feet the air became  charged with noise; shouts, shots and the rolling thunder of madly  pounding hoofs echoed flatly throughout the town. By-and-by yawned,  stretched and leaned back, reveling in the semi-conscious ecstasy of the  knowledge that he did not have to immediately get up. Fleas opened one  eye and cocked an ear in inquiry, and then rolled over on his back,  squirmed and sighed contentedly and long. The outfit of the Bar-20 had  come to town.    The noise came rapidly nearer and increased in volume as the riders  turned the corner and drew rein suddenly, causing their mounts to slide  on their haunches in ankle-deep dust.    \"Hullo, old Buck-with-th'-pants, how's yore liver?\"    \"Come up an irrigate, old tank!\"    \"Chase th' flea ranch an' trail along!\"    These were a few of the salutations discernible among the medley of  playful yells, the safety valves of supercharged good-nature.    \"Skr-e-e!\" yelled Hopalong Cassidy, letting off a fusillade of shots in  the vicinity of Fleas, who rapidly retreated around the corner, where he  wagged his tail in eager expectation. He was not disappointed, for a cow  pony tore around in pursuit and Hopalong leaned over and scratched the  yellow back, thumping it heartily, and, tossing a chunk of beef into the  open jaws of the delighted dog, departed as he had come. The advent of  the outfit meant a square meal, and the dog knew it.    In Cowan's, lined up against the bar, the others were earnestly and  assiduously endeavoring, with a promise of success, to get By-and-by  drunk, which endeavors coincided perfectly with By-and-by's idea of the  fitness of things. The fellowship and the liquor combined to thaw  out his reserve and to loosen his tongue. After gazing with an air of  injured surprise at the genial loosening of his knees he gravely handed  his rifle with an exaggerated sweep of his arm, to the cowboy nearest  him, and wrapped his arms around the recipient to insure his balance.  The rifle was passed from hand to hand until it came to Buck Peters, who  gravely presented it to its owner as a new gun.    By-and-by threw out his stomach in an endeavor to keep his head in line  with his heels, and grasping the weapon with both hands turned to Cowan,  to whom he gave it.    \"Yu hab this un. Me got two. Me keep new un, mebby so.\" Then he loosened  his belt and drank long and deep.    A shadow darkened the doorway and Hopalong limped in. Spying By-and-by  pushing the bottle into his mouth, while Red Connors propped him,  he grinned and took out five silver dollars, which he jingled under  By-and-by's eyes, causing that worthy to lay aside the liquor and  erratically grab for the tantalizing fortune.    \"Not yet, sabe?\" said Hopalong, changing the position of the money. \"If  yu wants to corral this here herd of simoleons yu has to ride a cayuse  what Red bet me yu can't ride. Yu has got to grow on that there saddle  and stayed growed for five whole minutes by Buck's ticker. I ain't  a-goin' to tell yu he's any saw-horse, for yu'd know better, as yu  reckons Red wouldn't bet on no losin' proposition if he knowed better,  which same he don't. Yu straddles that four-laigged cloudburst an' yu  gets these, sabe? I ain't seen th' cayuse yet that yu couldn't freeze  to, an' I'm backin' my opinions with my moral support an' one month's  pay.\"    By-and-by's eyes began to glitter as the meaning of the words  sifted through his befuddled mind. Ride a horse--five dollars--ride a  five-dollars horse--horses ride dollars--then he straightened up and  began to speak in an incoherent jumble of Sioux and bad English. He,  the mighty rider of the Sioux; he, the bravest warrior and the greatest  hunter; could he ride a horse for five dollars? Well, he rather thought  he could. Grasping Red by the shoulder, he tacked for the door and  narrowly missed hitting the bottom step first, landing, as it happened,  in the soft dust with Red's leg around his neck. Somewhat sobered by the  jar, he stood up and apologized to the crowd for Red getting in the way,  declaring that Red was a \"Heap good un,\" and that he didn't mean to do  it.    The outfit of the Bar-20 was, perhaps, the most famous of all from  Canada to the Rio Grande. The foreman, Buck Peters, controlled a crowd  of men (who had all the instincts of boys) that had shown no quarter  to many rustlers, and who, while always carefree and easy-going (even  fighting with great good humor and carelessness), had established the  reputation of being the most reckless gang of daredevil gun-fighters  that ever pounded leather. Crooked gaming houses, from El Paso  to Cheyenne and from Phoenix to Leavenworth, unanimously and  enthusiastically damned them from their boots to their sombreros, and  the sheriffs and marshals of many localities had received from their  hands most timely assistance--and some trouble. Wiry, indomitable,  boyish and generous, they were splendid examples of virile manhood; and,  surrounded as they were with great dangers and a unique civilization,  they should not, in justice, be judged by opinions born of the  commonplace.    They were real cowboys, which means, public opinion to the contrary  notwithstanding, that they were not lawless, nor drunken, shooting  bullies who held life cheaply, as their kin has been unjustly pictured;  but while these men were naturally peaceable they had to continually  rub elbows with men who were not. Gamblers, criminals, bullies and the  riffraff that fled from the protected East had drifted among them in  great numbers, and it was this class that caused the trouble.    The hardworking \"cow-punchers\" lived according to the law of the land,  and they obeyed that greatest of all laws, that of self-preservation.  Their fun was boisterous, but they paid for all the damage they  inflicted; their work was one continual hardship, and the reaction of  one extreme swings far toward the limit of its antithesis. Go back to  the Apple if you would trace the beginning of self-preservation and the  need.    Buck Peters was a man of mild appearance, somewhat slow of speech and  correspondingly quick of action, who never became flurried. His was the  master hand that controlled, and his Colts enjoyed the reputation of  never missing when a hit could have been expected with reason. Many  floods, stampedes and blizzards had assailed his nerves, but he yet  could pour a glass of liquor, held at arm's length, through"]]]
