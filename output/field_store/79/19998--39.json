Penn's ideal had always been to have Philadelphia what he called \"a  green country town.\" Probably he had in mind the beautiful English towns  of abundant foliage and open spaces. And Penn was successful, for many  of the Philadelphia houses stood by themselves, with gardens round them.  The present Walnut was first called Pool Street; Chestnut was called  Winn Street; and Market was called High Street. If he could have  foreseen the enormous modern growth of the city, he might not have made  his streets so narrow and level. But the fault lies perhaps rather with  the people for adhering so rigidly and for so long to Penn's scheme,  when traffic that he could not have imagined demanded wider streets.  If he could have lived into our times he would surely have sent us very  positive directions in his bluff British way to break up the original  rectangular, narrow plan which was becoming dismally monotonous when  applied to a widely spread-out modern city. He was a theologian, but he  had a very keen eye for appearances and beauty of surroundings.        Chapter IV. Types Of The Population    The arrival of colonists in Pennsylvania in greater numbers than in  Delaware and the Jerseys was the more notable because, within a few  years after Pennsylvania was founded, persecution of the Quakers ceased  in England and one prolific cause of their migration was no more.  Thirteen hundred Quakers were released from prison in 1686 by James  II; and in 1689, when William of Orange took the throne, toleration was  extended to the Quakers and other Protestant dissenters.    The success of the first Quakers who came to America brought others  even after persecution ceased in England. The most numerous class of  immigrants for the first fifteen or twenty years were Welsh, most of  whom were Quakers with a few Baptists and Church of England people. They  may have come not so much from a desire to flee from persecution as to  build up a little Welsh community and to revive Welsh nationalism. In  their new surroundings they spoke their own Welsh language and very few  of them had learned English. They had been encouraged in their national  aspirations by an agreement with Penn that they were to have a tract of  40,000 acres where they could live by themselves. The land assigned to  them lay west of Philadelphia in that high ridge along the present main  line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, now so noted for its wealthy suburban  homes. All the important names of townships and places in that region,  such as Wynnewood, St. Davids, Berwyn, Bryn Mawr, Merion, Haverford,  Radnor, are Welsh in origin. Some of the Welsh spread round to the north  of Philadelphia, where names like Gwynedd and Penllyn remain as their  memorials. The Chester Valley bordering the high ridge of their first  settlement they called Duffrin Mawr or Great Valley.    These Welsh, like so many of the Quakers, were of a well-to-do class.  They rapidly developed their fertile land and, for pioneers, lived quite  luxuriously. They had none of the usual county and township officers  but ruled their Welsh Barony, as it was called, through the authority of  their Quaker meetings. But this system eventually disappeared. The  Welsh were absorbed into the English population, and in a couple of  generations their language disappeared. Prominent people are descended  from them. David Rittenhouse, the astronomer, was Welsh on his mother's  side. David Lloyd, for a long time the leader of the popular party and  at one time Chief Justice, was a Welshman. Since the Revolution the  Welsh names of Cadwalader and Meredith have been conspicuous.    The Church of England people formed a curious and decidedly hostile  element in the early population of Pennsylvania. They established  themselves in Philadelphia in the beginning and rapidly grew into a  political party which, while it cannot be called very strong in numbers,  was important in ability and influence. After Penn's death, his sons  joined the Church of England, and the Churchmen in the province became  still stronger. They formed the basis of the proprietary party, filled  executive offices in the Government, and waged relentless war against  the Quaker majority which controlled the Legislature. During Penn's  lifetime the Churchmen were naturally opposed to the whole government,  both executive and legislative. They were constantly sending home to  England all sorts of reports and information calculated to show that the  Quakers were unfit to rule a province, that Penn should be deprived of  his charter, and that Pennsylvania should be put under the direct rule  of the King.    They had delightful schemes for making it a strong Church of England  colony like Virginia. One of them suggested that, as the title to the  Three Lower Counties, as Delaware was called, was in dispute, it should  be taken by the Crown and given to the Church as a manor to support  a bishop. Such an ecclesiastic certainly could have lived in princely  state from the rents of its fertile farms, with a palace, retinue,  chamberlains, chancellors, feudal courts, and all the appendages of  earthly glory. For the sake of the picturesqueness of colonial history  it is perhaps a pity that this pious plan was never carried out.    As it was, however, the Churchmen established themselves with not a  little glamour and romance round two institutions, Christ Church for the  first fifty years, and after that round the old College of Philadelphia.  The Reverend William Smith, a pugnacious and eloquent Scotchman, led  them in many a gallant onset against the \"haughty tribe\" of Quakers, and  he even suffered imprisonment in the cause. He had a country seat on  the Schuylkill and was in his way a fine character, devoted to the  establishment of ecclesiasticism and higher learning as a bulwark  against the menace of Quaker fanaticism; and but for the coming on of  the Revolution he might have become the first colonial bishop with all  the palaces, pomp, and glory appertaining thereunto.    In spite of this opposition, however, the Quakers continued their  control of the colony, serenely tolerating the anathemas of the  learned Churchmen and the fierce curses and brandished weapons of the  Presbyterians and Scotch-Irish. Curses and anathemas were no check  to the fertile soil. Grist continued to come to the mill; and the  agricultural products poured into Philadelphia to be carried away in the  ships. The contemplative Quaker took his profits as they passed; enacted  his liberalizing laws, his prison reform, his charities, his peace with  the savage Indians; allowed science, research, and all the kindly arts  of life to flourish; and seemed perfectly contented with the damnation  in the other world to which those who flourished under his rule  consigned him.    In discussing the remarkable success of the province, the colonists  always disputed whether the credit should be given to the fertile soil  or to the liberal laws and constitution. It was no doubt due to  both. But the obvious advantages of Penn's charter over the mixed and  troublesome governmental conditions in the Jerseys, Penn's personal fame  and the repute of the Quakers for liberalism then at its zenith, and the  wide advertising given to their ideas and Penn's, on the continent of  Europe as well as in England, seem to have been the reasons why more  people, and many besides Quakers, came to take advantage of that fertile  soil.    The first great increase of alien population came from Germany, which  was still in a state of religious turmoil, disunion, and depression from  the results of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War. The reaction  from dogma in Germany had produced a multitude of sects, all yearning  for greater liberty and prosperity than they had at home. Penn and other  Quakers had made missionary tours in Germany and had preached to the  people. The Germans do not appear to have been asked to come to the  Jerseys. But they were urged to come to Pennsylvania as soon as the  charter was obtained; and many of them made an immediate response. The  German mind was then at the height of its emotional unrestraint. It was  as unaccustomed to liberty of thought as to political liberty and it  produced a new sect or religious distinction almost every day. Many  of these sects came to Pennsylvania, where new small religious bodies  sprang up among them after their arrival. Schwenkfelders, Tunkers,  Labadists, New Born, New Mooners, Separatists, Zion's Brueder,  Ronsdorfer, Inspired, Quietists, Gichtelians, Depellians, Mountain Men,  River Brethren, Brinser Brethren, and the Society of the Woman in the  Wilderness, are names which occur in the annals of the province. But  these are only a few. In Lancaster County alone the number has at  different times been estimated at from twenty to thirty. It would  probably be impossible to make a complete list; some of them, indeed,  existed for only a few years. Their own writers describe them as  countless and bewildering. Many of them were characterized by the  strangest sort of German mysticism, and some of them were inclined to  monastic and hermit life and their devotees often lived in caves or  solitary huts in the woods.    It would hardly be accurate to call all the German sects Quakers, since  a great deal of their mysticism would have been anything but congenial  to the followers of Fox and Penn. Resemblances to Quaker doctrine can,  however, be found among many of them; and there was one large sect,  the Mennonites, who were often spoken of as German Quakers. The two  divisions fraternized and preached in each other's meetings. The  Mennonites were well educated as a class and Pastorius, their leader,  was a ponderously learned German. Most of the German sects left the  Quakers in undisturbed possession of Philadelphia, and spread out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#5)"],[1," out fresh combinations.    The battle that had begun in a storm of hail ended on the first day in a  storm of bullets that had been held in reserve by the Turks, and which  let off just after sundown.  They came from a natural trench, formed by  the dried-up bed of a stream which lay just below the hill on which the  first Greek trench was situated.  There were bushes growing on the bank  of the stream nearest to the Greek lines, and these hid the men who  occupied it.  Throughout the day there had been an irritating fire from  this trench from what appeared to be not more than a dozen rifles, but we  could see that it was fed from time to time with many boxes of  ammunition, which were carried to it on the backs of mules from the  Turkish position a half mile farther to the rear.  Bass and a corporal  took a great aversion to this little group of Turks, not because there  were too many of them to be disregarded, but because they were so near;  and Bass kept the corporal's services engaged in firing into it, and in  discouraging the ammunition mules when they were being driven in that  direction.  Our corporal was a sharp-shooter, and, accordingly, felt his  superiority to his comrades; and he had that cheerful contempt for his  officers that all true Greek soldiers enjoy; and so he never joined in  the volley-firing, but kept his ammunition exclusively for the dozen men  behind the bushes and for the mules.  He waged, as it were, a little  battle on his own account.  The other men rose as commanded and fired  regular volleys, and sank back again, but he fixed his sights to suit his  own idea of the range, and he rose when he was ready to do so, and fired  whenever he thought best.  When his officer, who kept curled up in the  hollow of the trench, commanded him to lie down, he would frown and shake  his head at the interruption, and paid no further attention to the order.  He was as much alone as a hunter on a mountain peak stalking deer, and  whenever he fired at the men in the bushes he would swear softly, and  when he fired at the mules he would chuckle and laugh with delight and  content.  The mules had to cross a ploughed field in order to reach the  bushes, and so we were able to mark where his bullets struck, and we  could see them skip across the field, kicking up the dirt as they  advanced, until they stopped the mule altogether, or frightened the man  who was leading it into a disorderly retreat.    It appeared later that instead of there being but twelve men in these  bushes there were six hundred, and that they were hiding there until the  sun set in order to make a final attack on the first trench.  They had  probably argued that at sunset the strain of the day's work would have  told on the Greek _morale_, that the men's nerves would be jerking and  their stomachs aching for food, and that they would be ready for darkness  and sleep, and in no condition to repulse a fresh and vigorous attack.  So, just as the sun sank, and the officers were counting the cost in dead  and wounded, and the men were gathering up blankets and overcoats, and  the firing from the Greek lines had almost ceased, there came a fierce  rattle from the trench to the right of us, like a watch-dog barking the  alarm, and the others took it up from all over the hill, and when we  looked down into the plain below to learn what it meant, we saw it blue  with men, who seemed to have sprung from the earth.  They were clambering  from the bed of the stream, breaking through the bushes, and forming into  a long line, which, as soon as formed, was at once hidden at regular  intervals by flashes of flame that seemed to leap from one gun-barrel to  the next, as you have seen a current of electricity run along a line of  gas-jets.  In the dim twilight these flashes were much more blinding than  they had been in the glare of the sun, and the crash of the artillery  coming on top of the silence was the more fierce and terrible by the  contrast.  The Turks were so close on us that the first trench could do  little to help itself, and the men huddled against it while their  comrades on the surrounding hills fought for them, their volleys passing  close above our heads, and meeting the rush of the Turkish bullets on the  way, so that there was now one continuous whistling shriek, like the roar  of the wind through the rigging of a ship in a storm.  If a man had  raised his arm above his head his hand would have been torn off.  It had  come up so suddenly that it was like two dogs, each springing at the  throat of the other, and in a greater degree it had something of the  sound of two wild animals struggling for life.  Volley answered volley as  though with personal hate--one crashing in upon the roll of the other, or  beating it out of recognition with the bursting roar of heavy cannon.  At  the same instant all of the Turkish batteries opened with great,  ponderous, booming explosions, and the little mountain guns barked and  snarled and shrieked back at them, and the rifle volleys crackled and  shot out blistering flames, while the air was filled with invisible  express trains that shook and jarred it and crashed into one another,  bursting and shrieking and groaning.  It seemed as though you were lying  in a burning forest, with giant tree trunks that had withstood the storms  of centuries crashing and falling around your ears, and sending up great  showers of sparks and flame.  This lasted for five minutes or less, and  then the death-grip seemed to relax, the volleys came brokenly, like a  man panting for breath, the bullets ceased to sound with the hiss of  escaping steam, and rustled aimlessly by, and from hill-top to hill-top  the officers' whistles sounded as though a sportsman were calling off his  dogs.  The Turks withdrew into the coming night, and the Greeks lay back,  panting and sweating, and stared open-eyed at one another, like men who  had looked for a moment into hell, and had come back to the world again.    The next day was like the first, except that by five o'clock in the  afternoon the Turks appeared on our left flank, crawling across the hills  like an invasion of great ants, and the Greek army that at Velestinos had  made the two best and most dignified stands of the war withdrew upon  Halmyros, and the Turks poured into the village and burned it, leaving  nothing standing save two tall Turkish minarets that many years before,  when Thessaly belonged to the Sultan, the Turks themselves had placed  there.        I--THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS      On the day the American troops landed on the coast of Cuba, the Cubans  informed General Wheeler that the enemy were intrenched at Guasimas,  blocking the way to Santiago.  Guasimas is not a village, nor even a  collection of houses; it is the meeting place of two trails which join at  the apex of a V, three miles from the seaport town of Siboney, and  continue merged in a single trail to Santiago.  General Wheeler, guided  by the Cubans, reconnoitred this trail on the 23rd of June, and with the  position of the enemy fully explained to him, returned to Siboney and  informed General Young and Colonel Wood that on the following morning he  would attack the Spanish position at Guasimas.  It has been stated that  at Guasimas, the Rough Riders were trapped in an ambush, but, as the plan  was discussed while I was present, I know that so far from any ones  running into an ambush, every one of the officers concerned had a full  knowledge of where he would find the enemy, and what he was to do when he  found him.    That night no one slept, for until two o'clock in the morning, troops  were still being disembarked in the surf, and two ships of war had their  searchlights turned on the landing-place, and made Siboney as light as a  ball-room.  Back of the searchlights was an ocean white with moonlight,  and on the shore red camp-fires, at which the half-drowned troops were  drying their uniforms, and the Rough Riders, who had just marched in from  Baiquiri, were cooking a late supper, or early breakfast of coffee and  bacon.  Below the former home of the Spanish comandante, which General  Wheeler had made his head-quarters, lay the camp of the Rough Riders, and  through it Cuban officers were riding their half-starved ponies, and  scattering the ashes of the camp-fires.  Below them was the beach and the  roaring surf, in which a thousand or so naked men were assisting and  impeding the progress shoreward of their comrades, in pontoons and shore  boats, which were being hurled at the beach like sleds down a water  chute.    It was one of the most weird and remarkable scenes of the war, probably  of any war.  An army was being landed on an enemy's coast at the dead of  night, but with the same cheers and shrieks and laughter that rise from  the bathers at Coney Island on a hot Sunday.  It was a pandemonium of  noises.  The men still to be landed from the \"prison hulks,\" as they  called the transports, were singing in chorus, the men already on shore  were dancing naked around the camp-fires on the beach, or shouting with  delight as they plunged into the first bath that had offered in seven  days, and those in the launches as they were pitched head-first at the  soil of Cuba, signalized their arrival by howls of triumph.  On either  side rose black overhanging ridges, in the lowland between were white  tents and burning fires, and from the ocean came the blazing, dazzling  eyes of the search-lights shaming the quiet moonlight.    After three hours' troubled sleep in this tumult the Rough Riders left  camp at five in the morning.  With the exception of half a dozen officers  they were dismounted, and carried their blanket rolls, haversacks,  ammunition, and carbines.  General Young had already started toward  Guasimas the First and Tenth dismounted Cavalry, and according to the  agreement of the night before had taken the eastern trail to our right,  while the Rough Riders"]]]
