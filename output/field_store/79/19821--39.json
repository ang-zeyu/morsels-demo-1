III      Blue-bird weather continued. Every day for a week Marche and Molly  Herold put out for Foam Island under summer skies, and with a soft wind  filling the sail; and in all the water-world there was no visible sign  of winter, save the dead reeds on muddy islands and the far and wintry  menace of the Atlantic crashing icily beyond the eastern dunes.    Few ducks and no geese or swans came to the blind. There was nothing  for them to do except to talk together or sit dozing in the sun. And,  imperceptibly, between them the elements of a pretty intimacy unfolded  like spring buds on unfamiliar branches; but what they might develop  into he did not know, and she had not even considered.    She had a quaint capacity for sleeping in the sunshine while he was away  on the island prowling hopefully after black ducks. And one morning,  when he returned to find her asleep at her post, a bunch of widgeon left  the stools right under her nose before he had a chance to shoot.    She did not awake. The sun fell warmly upon her, searching the  perfections of the childlike face and throat, gilding the palm of one  little, sun-tanned hand lying, partly open, on her knee. A spring-like  wind stirred a single strand of bright hair; lips slightly parted, she  lay there, face to the sky, and Marche thought that he had never looked  upon anything in all the world more pure and peaceful.    At noon the girl had not awakened. But something in John B. Marche had.  He looked in horrified surprise at the decoys, then looked at Molly  Herold; then he gazed in profound astonishment at Uncle Dudley, who made  a cryptic remark to the wife of his bosom, and then tipped upside down.    Marche examined the sky and water so carefully that he did not see them;  then, sideways, and with an increasing sensation of consternation, he  looked again at the sleeping girl.    His was not even a friendly gaze, now; there was more than dawning alarm  in it--an irritated curiosity which grew more intense as the seconds  throbbed out, absurdly timed by a most remarkable obligato from his  heart.    He gazed stonily upon this stranger into whose life he had drifted only  a week before, whose slumbers he felt that he was now unwarrantedly  invading with a mental presumption that scared him; and yet, as often as  he looked elsewhere, he looked back at her again, confused by the slowly  dawning recognition of a fascination which he was utterly powerless to  check or even control.    One thing was already certain; he wanted to know her, to learn from her  own lips intimately about herself, about her thoughts, her desires, her  tastes, her aspirations--even her slightest fancies.    Absorbed, charmed by her quiet breathing, fascinated into immobility, he  sat there gazing at her, trying to reconcile the steadily strengthening  desire to know her with what he already knew of her--of this sleeping  stranger, this shabby child of a poor man, dressed in the boots and  shooting coat of that wretchedly poor man--his own superintendent, a  sick man whom he had never even seen.    What manner of man could her father be--this man Herold--to have a child  of this sort, this finely molded, fine-grained, delicate, exquisitely  made girl, lying asleep here in a wind-stirred blind, with the Creator's  own honest sun searching out and making triumphant a beauty such as his  wise and city-worn eyes had never encountered, even under the mercies of  softened candlelight.    An imbecile repetition of speech kept recurring and even stirring his  lips, \"She'd make them all look like thirty cents.\" And he colored  painfully at the crudeness of his obsessing thoughts, angrily, after a  moment, shaking them from him.    A cartridge rolled from the shelf and splashed into the pit water; the  girl unclosed her gray eyes, met his gaze, smiled dreamily; then,  flushing a little, sat up straight.    \"Fifteen widgeon went off when I returned to the blind,\" he said,  unsmiling.    \"I _beg_ your pardon. I am--I am terribly sorry,\" she stammered, with a  vivid blush of confusion.    But the first smile from her unclosing eyes had already done damage  enough; the blush merely disorganized a little more what was already  chaos in a young man's mind.    \"Has--has anything else come in to the stools?\" she asked timidly.    \"No,\" he said, relenting.    But he was wrong. Something _had_ come into the blind--a winged,  fluttering thing, out of the empyrean--and even Uncle Dudley had not  seen or heard it, and never a honk or a quack warned anybody, or  heralded the unseen coming of the winged thing.    Marche sat staring out across the water.    \"I--am so very sorry,\" repeated the girl, in a low voice. \"Are you  offended with me?\"    He turned and looked at her, and spoke steadily enough: \"Of course I'm  not. I was glad you had a nap. There has been nothing doing--except  those stupid widgeon--not a feather stirring.\"    \"Then you are not angry with me?\"    \"Why, you absurd girl!\" he said, laughing and stretching out one hand  to her.    Into her face flashed an exquisite smile; daintily she reached out and  dropped her hand into his. They exchanged a friendly shake, still  smiling.    \"All the same,\" she said, \"it was horrid of me. And I think I boasted to  you about my knowledge of a bayman's duties.\"    \"You are all right,\" he said, \"a clean shot, a thoroughbred. I ask no  better comrade than you. I never again shall have such a comrade.\"    \"But--I am your bayman, not your comrade,\" she exclaimed, forcing a  little laugh. \"You'll have better guides than I, Mr. Marche.\"    \"Do you reject the equal alliance I offer, Miss Herold?\"    \"I?\" She flushed. \"It is very kind of you to put it that way. But I _am_  only your guide--but it is pleasant to have you speak that way.\"    \"What way?\"    \"The way you spoke about--your bayman's daughter.\"    He said, smilingly cool on the surface, but in a chaotic, almost idiotic  inward condition: \"I've sat here for days, wishing all the while that I  might really know you. Would you care to let me, Miss Herold?\"    \"Know me?\" she repeated. \"I don't think I understand.\"    \"Could you and your father and brother regard me as a guest--as a friend  visiting the family?\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because,\" he said, \"I'm the same kind of a man that you are a girl and  that your brother is a boy. Why, you know it, don't you? I know it. I  knew it as soon as I heard you speak, and when your brother came into  the room that first night with his Latin book, and when I saw your  mother's picture. So I know what your father must be. Am I not right?\"    She lifted her proud little head and looked at him. \"We are what you  think us,\" she said.    \"Then let us stand in that relation, Miss Herold. Will you?\"    She looked at him, perplexed, gray eyes clear and thoughtful. \"Do you  mean that you really want me for a friend?\" she asked calmly, but her  sensitive lip quivered a little.    \"Yes.\"    \"Do men make personal friends among their employees? Do they? I ask  because I don't know.\"    \"What was your father before he came here?\" he inquired bluntly.    She looked up, startled, then the color came slowly back to her cheeks.  \"Isn't that a little impertinent, Mr. Marche?\"    \"Good heavens! Yes, of course it is!\" he exclaimed, turning very red.  \"Will you forgive me? I didn't mean to be rude or anything like it! I  merely meant that whatever reverses have happened to bring such a girl  as you down into this God-forsaken place have not altered what you were  and what you are. _Can_ you forgive me?\"    \"Yes. I'll tell you something. I _wanted_ to be a little more  significant to you than merely a paid guide. So did Jim. We--it is  rather lonely for us. You are the first real man who has come into our  lives in five years. Do you understand, Mr. Marche?\"    \"Of course I do.\"    \"Are you sure you do? We would like to feel that we could talk to  you--Jim would. It is pleasant to hear a man from the real world  speaking. Not that the people here are unkind, only\"--she looked up at  him almost wistfully--\"we _are_ like you, Mr. Marche--and we feel  starved, sometimes.\"    He did not trust himself to speak, even to look at her, just at the  moment. Not heretofore sentimental, but always impressionable, he was  young enough to understand, wise enough not to misunderstand.    After a while, leaning back in the blind, he began, almost casually,  talking about things in that Northern world which had once been hers,  assuming their common interest in matters purely local, in details, of  metropolitan affairs, in the changing physiognomy of the monstrous city,  its superficial aspects, its complex phases.    Timidly, at first, she ventured a question now and then, and after a  while, as her reserve melted, she asked more boldly, and even offered  her own comments on men and things, so that, for the first time, he had  a glimpse of her mind at work--brief, charming surprises, momentary  views of a young girl's eager intelligence, visions of her sad and  solitary self, more guessed at than revealed in anything she said or  left unsaid.    And now they were talking together with free and unfeigned interest and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2439"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 2 (#5)"],[1,"departments of the civil administration. At length a change  took place. Lewis the Fourteenth had, from an early age, regarded  the Calvinists with an aversion at once religious and political. As  a zealous Roman Catholic, he detested their theological dogmas. As a  prince fond of arbitrary power, he detested those republican theories  which were intermingled with the Genevese divinity. He gradually  retrenched all the privileges which the schismatics enjoyed. He  interfered with the education of Protestant children, confiscated  property bequeathed to Protestant consistories, and on frivolous  pretexts shut up Protestant churches. The Protestant ministers were  harassed by the tax gatherers. The Protestant magistrates were deprived  of the honour of nobility. The Protestant officers of the royal  household were informed that His Majesty dispensed with their services.  Orders were given that no Protestant should be admitted into the legal  profession. The oppressed sect showed some faint signs of that spirit  which in the preceding century had bidden defiance to the whole power  of the House of Valois. Massacres and executions followed. Dragoons  were quartered in the towns where the heretics were numerous, and in the  country seats of the heretic gentry; and the cruelty and licentiousness  of these rude missionaries was sanctioned or leniently censured by the  government. Still, however, the edict of Nantes, though practically  violated in its most essential provisions, had not been formally  rescinded; and the King repeatedly declared in solemn public acts that  he was resolved to maintain it. But the bigots and flatterers who had  his ear gave him advice which he was but too willing to take. They  represented to him that his rigorous policy had been eminently  successful, that little or no resistance had been made to his will, that  thousands of Huguenots had already been converted, that, if he would  take the one decisive step which yet remained, those who were still  obstinate would speedily submit, France would be purged from the taint  of heresy, and her prince would have earned a heavenly crown not less  glorious than that of Saint Lewis. These arguments prevailed. The final  blow was struck. The edict of Nantes was revoked; and a crowd of decrees  against the sectaries appeared in rapid succession. Boys and girls  were torn from their parents and sent to be educated in convents. All  Calvinistic ministers were commanded either to abjure their religion or  to quit their country within a fortnight. The other professors of the  reformed faith were forbidden to leave the kingdom; and, in order to  prevent them from making their escape, the outports and frontiers were  strictly guarded. It was thought that the flocks, thus separated from  the evil shepherds, would soon return to the true fold. But in spite of  all the vigilance of the military police there was a vast emigration.  It was calculated that, in a few months, fifty thousand families quitted  France for ever. Nor were the refugees such as a country can well spare.  They were generally persons of intelligent minds, of industrious habits,  and of austere morals. In the list are to be found names eminent in war,  in science, in literature, and in art. Some of the exiles offered their  swords to William of Orange, and distinguished themselves by the  fury with which they fought against their persecutor. Others avenged  themselves with weapons still more formidable, and, by means of the  presses of Holland, England, and Germany, inflamed, during thirty years,  the public mind of Europe against the French government. A more peaceful  class erected silk manufactories in the eastern suburb of London. One  detachment of emigrants taught the Saxons to make the stuffs and hats of  which France had hitherto enjoyed a monopoly. Another planted the first  vines in the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope. [12]    In ordinary circumstances the courts of Spain and of Rome would have  eagerly applauded a prince who had made vigorous war on heresy. But such  was the hatred inspired by the injustice and haughtiness of Lewis that,  when he became a persecutor, the courts of Spain and Rome took the side  of religious liberty, and loudly reprobated the cruelty of turning a  savage and licentious soldiery loose on an unoffending people. [13]  One cry of grief and rage rose from the whole of Protestant Europe. The  tidings of the revocation of the edict of Nantes reached England about  a week before the day to which the Parliament stood adjourned. It was  clear then that the spirit of Gardiner and of Alva was still the  spirit of the Roman Catholic Church. Lewis was not inferior to James in  generosity and humanity, and was certainly far superior to James in all  the abilities and acquirements of a statesman. Lewis had, like James,  repeatedly promised to respect the privileges of his Protestant  subjects. Yet Lewis was now avowedly a persecutor of the reformed  religion. What reason was there, then, to doubt that James waited only  for an opportunity to follow the example? He was already forming, in  defiance of the law, a military force officered to a great extent by  Roman Catholics. Was there anything unreasonable in the apprehension  that this force might be employed to do what the French dragoons had  done?    James was almost as much disturbed as his subjects by the conduct of the  court of Versailles. In truth, that court had acted as if it had meant  to embarrass and annoy him. He was about to ask from a Protestant  legislature a full toleration for Roman Catholics. Nothing, therefore,  could be more unwelcome to him than the intelligence that, in a  neighbouring country, toleration had just been withdrawn by a Roman  Catholic government from Protestants. His vexation was increased by a  speech which the Bishop of Valence, in the name of the Gallican clergy,  addressed at this time to Lewis, the Fourteenth. The pious Sovereign of  England, the orator said, looked to the most Christian King for support  against a heretical nation. It was remarked that the members of the  House of Commons showed particular anxiety to procure copies of this  harangue, and that it was read by all Englishmen with indignation and  alarm. [14] James was desirous to counteract the impression which these  things had made, and was also at that moment by no means unwilling to  let all Europe see that he was not the slave of France. He therefore  declared publicly that he disapproved of the manner in which the  Huguenots had been treated, granted to the exiles some relief from his  privy purse, and, by letters under his great seal, invited his subjects  to imitate his liberality. In a very few months it became clear that all  this compassion was feigned for the purpose of cajoling his Parliament,  that he regarded the refugees with mortal hatred, and that he regretted  nothing so much as his own inability to do what Lewis had done.    On the ninth of November the Houses met. The Commons were summoned to  the bar of the Lords; and the King spoke from the throne. His speech had  been composed by himself. He congratulated his loving subjects on the  suppression of the rebellion in the West: but he added that the speed  with which that rebellion had risen to a formidable height, and the  length of time during which it had continued to rage, must convince  all men how little dependence could be placed on the militia. He had,  therefore, made additions to the regular army. The charge of that army  would henceforth be more than double of what it had been; and he trusted  that the Commons would grant him the means of defraying the increased  expense. He then informed his hearers that he had employed some officers  who had not taken the test; but he knew them to be fit for public trust.  He feared that artful men might avail themselves of this irregularity  to disturb the harmony which existed between himself and his Parliament.  But he would speak out. He was determined not to part with servants on  whose fidelity he could rely, and whose help he might perhaps soon need.  [15]    This explicit declaration that he had broken the laws which were  regarded by the nation as the chief safeguards of the established  religion, and that he was resolved to persist in breaking those laws,  was not likely to soothe the excited feelings of his subjects. The  Lords, seldom disposed to take the lead in opposition to a government,  consented to vote him formal thanks for what he had said. But the  Commons were in a less complying mood. When they had returned to their  own House there was a long silence; and the faces of many of the most  respectable members expressed deep concern. At length Middleton rose and  moved the House to go instantly into committee on the King's speech: but  Sir Edmund Jennings, a zealous Tory from Yorkshire, who was supposed  to speak the sentiments of Danby, protested against this course, and  demanded time for consideration. Sir Thomas Clarges, maternal uncle of  the Duke of Albemarle, and long distinguished in Parliament as a man of  business and a viligant steward of the public money, took the same  side. The feeling of the House could not be mistaken. Sir John Ernley,  Chancellor of the Exchequer, insisted that the delay should not exceed  forty-eight hours; but he was overruled; and it was resolved that the  discussion should be postponed for three days. [16]    The interval was well employed by those who took the lead against the  court. They had indeed no light work to perform. In three days a country  party was to be organized. The difficulty of the task is in our age not  easily to be appreciated; for in our age all the nation may be said to  assist at every deliberation of the Lords and Commons. What is said by  the leaders of the ministry and of the opposition after midnight is read  by the whole metropolis at dawn, by the inhabitants of Northumberland  and Cornwall in "]]]
