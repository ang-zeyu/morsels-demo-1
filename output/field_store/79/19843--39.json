Their first plan was to meet the Indians  peaceably, and, by gentle measures, find an opportunity to seize Mary  Bosomworth and ship her to England. In the town of Savannah there were  only one hundred and seventy men able to bear arms. The president of  the Province sent a messenger to Mary, while she and her followers were  still several miles distant, warning her to give up her wild scheme.  Mary sent back a message expressing her contempt for the Colony and its  officials. Thereupon the president of the Province determined to put  the best possible face on the matter, and receive Mary and her savage  followers boldly. Accordingly the militia was ordered under arms; and as  the Indians entered the town, they were stopped by Colonel Noble Jones,  who, at the head of a company of horse, demanded to know whether they  came with friendly or hostile intentions. He received no satisfactory  answer to his demand, whereupon he informed the Indians that they must  ground their arms, as he had orders not to permit an armed man  among them to set foot within the town. The Indians submitted to the  unexpected demand, but with great reluctance.    Having grounded their arms, the Indians were allowed to enter the town.  They marched in regular order, headed by Thomas Bosomworth, who, decked  out in full canonical robes, with Mary by his side, was followed by  the various chiefs according to their rank. The army of Indians made a  formidable appearance as they marched into the town, and the inhabitants  were terror-stricken at the sight. They marched to the parade ground,  where they found the militia drawn up to receive them. Here they were  saluted with fifteen guns, and then conducted to the president's house.  When the Indians were assembled there, Thomas and Mary Bosomworth were  ordered to withdraw. Then the president and council asked the Indian  chiefs in a friendly manner why they visited the town in so large a  body, not having been sent for by any person in lawful authority. The  Indians replied that Mary, their empress, was to speak for them, and  that they would abide by what she said. They had heard that she was to  be made a prisoner and sent across the great waters, and they wanted to  know why they were to lose their queen. They said they intended no harm  to the whites, and begged that their arms might be restored to them.  Then, after talking with Bosomworth and his wife, they would return and  settle all public affairs. Their arms were restored to them, but orders  were given that on no account should any ammunition be issued until the  true purpose of their visit was made known.    The Indians then had a conference with Mary Bosomworth, and on the  following day began to conduct themselves riotously, running up and down  the streets like madmen. As all the men were obliged to perform guard  duty, the women were compelled to remain alone in their houses. They  were in a constant state of terror and alarm, expecting every moment to  be set upon and killed by the unruly savages. While the confusion was at  its worst, a rumor was circulated that the Indians had cut off the head  of the president of the council. The report was false; but the colonists  were in such a state of excitement, that they could scarcely be  restrained from firing on the Indians. The situation was very critical.  Great prudence was necessary in order to prevent bloodshed, and save the  town from destruction.    At this crisis orders were given to the militia to lay hold of Thomas  Bosomworth, and place him in close confinement. When this order was  carried out, Mary became frantic, and made threats of vengeance against  the whole Colony. She cursed General Oglethorpe, declared that his  treaties were fraudulent, and ordered the colonists to depart from her  territory. She raved furiously, and claimed control over the entire  earth. But while engaged in cutting up these extraordinary capers, she  kept an eye on the leading men among the Indians, who she knew could be  easily bribed.    The president of the Province, finding that nothing could be done with  the Indians while they remained under the influence of their so-called  empress, caused Mary to be privately arrested, and placed her under  guard with her husband. When this was done, quiet was at once restored.  The Indians ceased to be boisterous. When the time seemed to be ripe,  the president of the Province employed men acquainted with the Creek  language to entertain the chiefs and their warriors in the friendliest  way. A feast was prepared; and in the midst of it the chiefs were told  that Bosomworth had become involved in debt, and was anxious to secure  not only all the lands of the Creeks, but also a large share of the  bounty paid to them by the King of England, so that he might be able to  pay his creditors in Carolina. He was also told that the King's presents  were intended only for the Indians; that the lands near the town were  reserved for them for their encampments; that the sea islands were  reserved for them to hunt upon when they should come to bathe in the  salt waters; and that neither Mary nor her husband had any right to  these lands, which were the common property of the Creek nations.    For the moment this policy was successful. Even Malatche, Mary's  brother, seemed to be satisfied; and many of the chiefs declared that  they were convinced that Bosomworth had deceived them, and that they  would trust him no more. But Malatche, at his own request, had another  talk with Thomas and Mary Bosomworth, and was again won over to support  their wild pretensions; so that, when the Indians were gathered together  to receive their shares of the royal bounty, Malatche stood up in the  midst of them, and delivered a most violent speech in favor of the  claims of Mary as the Empress of Georgia. He declared that she had three  thousand warriors at her command, and that every man of them would take  up arms in her defense. At the conclusion of his speech, Malatche drew  forth a paper and presented it to the president of the council This  paper was merely the sum and substance of Malatche's speech; and it  was so clearly the production of Bosomworth, that the effect was far  different from what the Indians had expected. The astonishment of the  president and council was so apparent, that Malatche begged to have the  paper again, so that he might deliver it to the person from whom he had  received it.    It was important that another conference should be had with the Indians.  Accordingly they were called together again; and the president of the  Province made an address, recalling to their minds the fact that when  General Oglethorpe and his colony landed in Georgia, they found Mary,  then the wife of John Musgrove, living in a hut at Yamacraw; that at  that time she was comparatively poor and friendless, being neglected  and despised by the Creeks, and going about in rags; that General  Oglethorpe, finding that she could speak both the English and the Creek  tongues, employed her as an interpreter, gave her rich clothes, and made  her a woman of some consequence; that she was respected by the colonists  until she married Thomas Bosomworth, but from that time forth they no  longer had any confidence in her; that she had no lands of her own; and  that General Oglethorpe had no treaty with her, but dealt with the old  and wise leaders of the Creeks, who voluntarily surrendered their waste  lands to the whites. The president then went on to show that Mary's  claims had been invented by Thomas Bosomworth as an easy means of  paying a debt of four hundred pounds which he owed in South Carolina for  cattle, and that his quarrel with the colonists was due to the fact  that they had refused to give him a third part of the royal bounty which  belonged by right to the Indians.    At this point the Creek chiefs begged the president to stop. They had  heard enough to convince them, they said, and now they wanted to smoke  the pipe of peace. Apparently this was a happy ending to a very serious  dispute. But at the very moment when everything was serene, Mary  Bosomworth made her appearance amongst those who were patching up their  differences. She had escaped from her guards, and, having secured a  supply of rum, now made her appearance drunk and furious. She filled the  air with threats. The president told her, that, unless she ceased her  efforts to poison the minds of the Indians, he would again order her  into close confinement. Thereupon Mary turned to Malatche and told him  what the president had said. In a rage, Malatche seized his arms, and,  calling to the rest of the Indians to do the same, dared the whites to  touch the empress. The uproar was great. Every Indian had his tomahawk  in his hand, and the council expected nothing less than instant death.    At this moment, Captain Noble Jones, who commanded the guard, ordered  the Indians to deliver up their arms. The savages were overawed by the  coolness and courage of this intrepid officer. They yielded up their  arms, and Mary was shut in a private room, and a guard set over her.  There she was securely kept, and while the Indians remained she had no  further communication with them. Her husband was then sent for, and  the president and council tried to reason with him; but he remained  obstinate, declaring that he would stand up for his wife's rights to  the last. Finding Bosomworth unreasonable, the council caused him to  be seized and confined. This done, the authorities then set about  persuading the Indians to leave the town peaceably and return to their  own settlements. This the savages did after a while, leaving Savannah in  small parties until all were gone.    Finding himself no longer supported by the Indians, Thomas Bosomworth  at last repented of his folly. He wrote to the president and council,  apologizing for his wanton conduct. He acknowledged the title of his  wife to be groundless, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#5)"],[1,"her beautiful hair. A whisper went round the Council  House. \"It was Loki did this--no one else in Asgard would have done a  deed so shameful,\" one said to the other.    \"Loki it was who did it,\" said Thor. \"He has hidden himself, but I shall  find him and I will slay him.\"    \"Nay, not so, Thor,\" said Odin, the Father of the Gods. \"Nay, no Dweller  in Asgard may slay another. I shall summon Loki to come before us here.  It is for you to make him (and remember that Loki is cunning and able to  do many things) bring back to Sif the beauty of her golden hair.\"    Then the call of Odin, the call that all in Asgard have to harken to,  went through the City of the Gods. Loki heard it, and he had to come  from his hiding-place and enter the house where the Gods held their  Council. And when he looked on Thor and saw the rage that was in his  eyes, and when he looked on Odin and saw the sternness in the face of  the Father of the Gods, he knew that he would have to make amends for  the shameful wrong he had done to Sif.    Said Odin, \"There is a thing that you, Loki, have to do: Restore to Sif  the beauty of her hair.\"    Loki looked at Odin, Loki looked at Thor, and he saw that what was said  would have to be done. His quick mind searched to find a way of  restoring to Sif the beauty of her golden hair.    \"I shall do as you command, Odin All-Father,\" he said.    But before we tell you of what Loki did to restore the beauty of Sif's  golden hair, we must tell you of the other beings besides the Gods and  the Goddesses who were in the world at the time. First, there was the  Vanir. When the Gods who were called the AEsir came to the mountain on  which they built Asgard, they found other beings there. These were not  wicked and ugly like the Giants; they were beautiful and friendly; the  Vanir they were named.    Although they were beautiful and friendly the Vanir had no thought of  making the world more beautiful or more happy. In that way they differed  from the AEsir who had such a thought. The AEsir made peace with them, and  they lived together in friendship, and the Vanir came to do things that  helped the AEsir to make the world more beautiful and more happy. Freya,  whom the Giant wanted to take away with the Sun and the Moon as a reward  for the building of the wall round Asgard, was of the Vanir. The other  beings of the Vanir were Frey, who was the brother of Freya, and Nioerd,  who was their father.    On the earth below there were other beings--the dainty Elves, who danced  and fluttered about, attending to the trees and flowers and grasses. The  Vanir were permitted to rule over the Elves. Then below the earth, in  caves and hollows, there was another race, the Dwarfs or Gnomes, little,  twisted creatures, who were both wicked and ugly, but who were the best  craftsmen in the world.    In the days when neither the AEsir nor the Vanir were friendly to him  Loki used to go down to Svartheim, the Dwarfs' dwelling below the earth.  And now that he was commanded to restore to Sif the beauty of her hair,  Loki thought of help he might get from the Dwarfs.    Down, down, through the winding passages in the earth he went, and he  came at last to where the Dwarfs who were most friendly to him were  working in their forges. All the Dwarfs were master-smiths, and when he  came upon his friends he found them working hammer and tongs, beating  metals into many shapes. He watched them for a while and took note of  the things they were making. One was a spear, so well balanced and made  that it would hit whatever mark it was thrown at no matter how bad the  aim the thrower had. The other was a boat that could sail on any sea,  but that could be folded up so that it would go into one's pocket. The  spear was called Gungnir and the boat was called Skidbladnir.    Loki made himself very agreeable to the Dwarfs, praising their work and  promising them things that only the Dwellers in Asgard could give,  things that the Dwarfs longed to possess. He talked to them till the  little, ugly folk thought that they would come to own Asgard and all  that was in it.    At last Loki said to them, \"Have you got a bar of fine gold that you can  hammer into threads--into threads so fine that they will be like the  hair of Sif, Thor's wife? Only the Dwarfs could make a thing so  wonderful. Ah, there is the bar of gold. Hammer it into those fine  threads, and the Gods themselves will be jealous of your work.\"    Flattered by Loki's speeches, the Dwarfs who were in the forge took up  the bar of fine gold and flung it into the fire. Then taking it out and  putting it upon their anvil they worked on the bar with their tiny  hammers until they beat it into threads that were as fine as the hairs  of one's head. But that was not enough. They had to be as fine as the  hairs on Sif's head, and these were finer than anything else. They  worked on the threads, over and over again, until they were as fine as  the hairs on Sif's head. The threads were as bright as sunlight, and  when Loki took up the mass of worked gold it flowed from his raised hand  down on the ground. It was so fine that it could be put into his palm,  and it was so light that a bird might not feel its weight.    Then Loki praised the Dwarfs more and more, and he made more and more  promises to them. He charmed them all, although they were an unfriendly  and a suspicious folk. And before he left them he asked them for the  spear and the boat he had seen them make, the spear Gungnir and the  boat Skidbladnir. The Dwarfs gave him these things, though in a while  after they wondered at themselves for giving them.    Back to Asgard Loki went. He walked into the Council House where the  Dwellers in Asgard were gathered. He met the stern look in Odin's eyes  and the rageful look in Thor's eyes with smiling good humor. \"Off with  thy veil, O Sif,\" he said. And when poor Sif took off her veil he put  upon her shorn head the wonderful mass of gold he held in his palm. Over  her shoulders the gold fell, fine, soft, and shining as her own hair.  And the AEsir and the Asyniur, the Gods and the Goddesses, and the Van  and Vana, when they saw Sif's head covered again with the shining web,  laughed and clapped their hands in gladness. And the shining web held to  Sif's head as if indeed it had roots and was growing there.          [Illustration]    HOW BROCK BROUGHT JUDGMENT ON LOKI      It was then that Loki, with the wish of making the AEsir and the Vanir  friendly to him once more, brought out the wonderful things he had  gained from the Dwarfs--the spear Gungnir and the boat Skidbladnir. The  AEsir and the Vanir marveled at things so wonderful. Loki gave the spear  as a gift to Odin, and to Frey, who was chief of the Vanir, he gave the  boat Skidbladnir.    All Asgard rejoiced that things so wonderful and so helpful had been  brought to them. And Loki, who had made a great show in giving these  gifts, said boastingly:    \"None but the Dwarfs who work for me could make such things. There are  other Dwarfs, but they are as unhandy as they are misshapen. The Dwarfs  who are my servants are the only ones who can make such wonders.\"    Now Loki in his boastfulness had said a foolish thing. There were other  Dwarfs besides those who had worked for him, and one of these was there  in Asgard. All unknown to Loki he stood in the shadow of Odin's seat,  listening to what was being said. Now he went over to Loki, his little,  unshapely form trembling with rage--Brock, the most spiteful of all the  Dwarfs.    \"Ha, Loki, you boaster,\" he roared, \"you lie in your words. Sindri, my  brother, who would scorn to serve you, is the best smith in Svartheim.\"    The AEsir and the Vanir laughed to see Loki outfaced by Brock the Dwarf  in the middle of his boastfulness. As they laughed Loki grew angry.    \"Be silent, Dwarf,\" he said, \"your brother will know about smith's work  when he goes to the Dwarfs who are my friends, and learns something from  them.\"    \"He learn from the Dwarfs who are your friends! My brother Sindri learn  from the Dwarfs who are your friends!\" Brock roared, in a greater rage  than before. \"The things you have brought out of Svartheim would not be  noticed by the AEsir and the Vanir if they were put beside the things  that my brother Sindri can make.\"    \"Sometime we will try your brother Sindri and see what he can do,\" said  Loki.    \"Try now, try now,\" Brock shouted. \"I'll wager my head against yours,  Loki, that his work will make the Dwellers in Asgard laugh at your  boasting.\"    \"I will take your wager,\" said Loki. \"My head against yours. And glad  will I be to see that ugly head of yours off your misshapen shoulders.\"    \"The AEsir will judge whether my brother's work is not the best that ever  came out of Svartheim. And they will see to it that you will pay your  wager, Loki, the head off your shoulders. Will ye not sit in judgment, O  Dwellers in Asgard?\"    \"We will sit in judgment,\" said the AEsir. Then, still full of rage,  Brock the Dwarf went down to Svartheim, and to the place where his  brother Sindri worked.    There was Sindri in his glowing forge, working with bellows and anvil  and hammers beside him, and around him masses of metal--gold and silver,  copper and iron. Brock told his tale, how he had wagered his head  against Loki's that Sindri could make things more wonderful than the  spear and the boat that Loki had brought into Asgard.    \"You were right in what you said, my brother,\" said Sindri, \"and you  shall not lose your head to Loki. But the two of us must work at what I  am going to forge. It will be your work to keep the fire so that it will  neither blaze up nor die down for a single instant. If you can keep the  fire as I tell you, we will forge a wonder. Now, brother, keep your  hands upon the bellows, and keep the fire under your control.\"    Then into the fire Sindri threw, not a piece of metal, but a pig's skin.  Brock kept his hands on the bellows,"]]]
