Or  who has explored the lumber accumulated in many a disused cellar within a  quarter of a mile of the Mansion House? The very existence of the trunks  which we have mentioned proves that such things do still linger in the  nooks and crannies of this great city.    And I would not confine my surmise in this direction to London alone. Two  ancient libraries there are, one in the North Countrie, the other in the  West, that to my certain knowledge have never been explored by modern  bibliographer. The latter is spurned and neglected, the books are deep in  dust and even mildew; the former is also neglected, but at least the  house is inhabited. The owner, an old, old woman, will never permit of  any volume being disturbed. It is said that her father collected the  books many years ago, and that she still guards them jealously for him.    Perhaps one day a copy of the 'Nigramansir' will emerge from its long  sleep in some such house as these. Indeed, it is not so much a matter of  surprise that such books should have disappeared, as that they should  have remained hidden for so long. In 1909 an ancient volume was  accidentally discovered in an old manor-house in the North of England,  where it had lain undisturbed for generations. It proved to consist of no  less than five of Caxton's publications bound up together. Moreover, it  was in the original binding, and was bound, probably, by one of Caxton's  workmen, whose initials it bore. On being put up for sale at Sotheby's,  it changed hands at L2,600.    The account which Gairdner gives in the Introduction to his last edition  of the Paston letters, of the loss and rediscovery of those historic  documents, is also a striking example of the manner in which books may  lie hidden for years. For nearly a century the originals of Sir John  Fenn's compilation were utterly lost. 'Even Mr. Serjeant Frere who edited  the fifth volume . . . declared that he had not been able to find the  originals of that volume any more than those of the others. Strange to  say, however, the originals of that volume were in his house all the  time. . . .' Gairdner then applied to the owner of Roydon Hall for the  remainder of the manuscripts, but received answer 'that he did not see  how such MSS. should have found their way to Roydon.' Yet there they were  discovered (with many others) eight years later! Even then the  whereabouts of the letters forming Fenn's first and second volumes, which  he had presented in 1787 to King George III., was still unknown. 'The  late Prince Consort . . . caused a careful search to be made for them,  but it proved quite ineffectual.' No wonder, for in 1889 they came to  light in a Suffolk manor-house!    It is difficult to portray in words the sensations of the book-collector  when engaged in searching some ancient building or library--especially if  he be upon a 'hot scent.' The thrills that he experiences as he handles  some rich volume that has lain hid for years, the delicious excitement  that pervades him while exploring some huge charter chest or ancient  oaken press, these are feelings not to be described in words. 'It was  discovered in the library at such and such a place,' we read, and we  barely stop to picture the scene of its finding or to imagine the  sensations of its finder. The very finding at Syon by 'Master Richard  Sutton, Esq.,' of the manuscript containing the 'revelacions' of St.  Katherin of Siena, from which de Worde printed his edition, conjures up a  whole romance in itself; yet in his eulogy of the work Wynkyn dismisses  the matter briefly, merely stating that it was found 'in a corner by  itself.' 'We were shipwrecked,' says the mariner, relating his  adventures; and in those three words what a world of incident and  sensations is comprised!    Our book-hunter confesses frankly to having had much good luck in book  collecting. Some years ago he made up his mind to start collecting  Elzeviers, more with the intention of gathering a representative  collection of books printed by that great family of printers than with  any idea of specialising in them. Probably he was urged thereto by  reading that wholly delightful book 'The Library' by Andrew Lang, wherein  the author discourses so pleasantly on these rare pygmies of the book  world. 'The Pastissier Francois,' we read, 'has lately fetched L600 at a  sale'; and the 'Caesar' of 1635 seemed nearly as rare, provided it were a  copy of that impression wherein the 149th page is misprinted '153.' A  little later our bookman was dipping, for the _n_-th time, into that  bibliophile's bible 'The Book Hunter,' by John Hill Burton, whose opinion  of the Caesar seemed even higher, for he devotes nearly half a page to  the little volume which Brunet describes as 'une des plus jolies et plus  rares de la collection des Elsevier.'    That decided our friend. He would collect Elzeviers. Moreover, he would  continue to collect them until he had acquired both the 'Pastissier  Francois' and the 1635 'Caesar.' Such was the confidence of youth! So he  sallied forth straight away, determined to ransack the nooks and corners  of certain shops of his acquaintance.    He didn't find the 'Pastissier Francois' that afternoon, but he found the  1635 'Caesar' in Charing Cross Road for _two shillings_. Moreover, it had  the requisite misprint and certain other distinctions which proclaim it  to be of the rare impression, and it is no less than 126 millimetres in  height! He has not yet come across the Pastissier, but doubtless he will  find a copy one day, provided his luck holds good.    The little 'Pastissier' is a far more interesting volume than the  'Caesar.' The latter is a dainty book, beautifully printed upon fine  paper, with folding maps and plans of castramentation. The 'Pastissier,'  on the other hand, is a disappointing little book in appearance, for it  is but indifferently printed upon poor paper. It cannot even claim the  merit of originality, being merely a pirated reprint of a volume that  appeared in Paris some two years previously.[11] But it is very, very  rare, and it has been celebrated by many distinguished pens.    '\"Monsieur,\" said I, \"pray forgive me if my question seems impertinent,  but are you extremely fond of eggs?\"'    Such were the words with which Alexandre Dumas first addressed Charles  Nodier, the famous dramatist and bibliophile, whom he found sitting next  to him at the Theatre Porte-Saint-Martin. Dumas' curiosity as to the  little volume that was engrossing his neighbour's attention more than  the play was at length allayed, and it was a view of the title-page that  prompted his unusual question. Looking over his neighbour's shoulder, he  read, opposite the engraved frontispiece, as follows:--    [Illustration: LE PASTISSIER FRANCOIS  Ou est enseigne la maniere de  faire toute sorte de Pastisserie,  tres-utile a toute sorte  de personnes.  _ENSEMBLE_  _Le moyen d'aprester toutes sortes d'oeufs_  _pour les jours maigres & autres,_  _en plus de soixante facons._  _A AMSTERDAM_  Chez Louys & Daniel Elzevier  _A M DC LV._]    But Nodier was far from being the gourmet that Dumas supposed him to be.  He was merely a bookhunter devouring a rare 'find'; and the little book,  he explained to Dumas, was one of those tiny volumes published in the  seventeenth century by the house of the Elzeviers at Leyden and  Amsterdam; and of all the many productions of that press, this was the  most sought for by collectors.    Elzeviers, however, are no longer fashionable, in this country at least.  The Caesar might possibly bring five pounds if it came to the notice of an  Elzevier specialist, but I doubt it.[12] Only the Pastissier has retained  its exalted price, probably on account of its notoriety. A copy, in  modern calf binding, sold recently (1917) at Sotheby's for so much as  L130; but Lord Vernon's copy, choicely bound by Cape, realised only L70  at the Sudbury sale in June 1918. However, it was a poor copy and much  cut down.    Railway-trains, among other things, have killed Elzeviers. Nothing could  be more convenient for saddle-bag or knapsack, or the restricted luggage  which one could stow in the boot of a coach. But who makes a practice  nowadays of putting books into his suit-case or gladstone-bag?[13]  Besides, before the advent of railways, there was not the same facility  for distributing books, and one might travel many leagues and visit many  villages without coming to a place where there would be a bookshop. In  travelling nowadays one is continually in the presence of cheap books.    The fate of the little Pastissier was probably that of many popular  books. There must have been thousands of copies of it printed. Dumas, in  that delightful chapter of 'Mes Memoires' which we have just quoted,  makes Nodier say, 'Techener declares that there were five thousand five  hundred copies issued, and I maintain that there were more than ten  thousand printed'; and he goes on to declare that 'there are probably  only ten examples of it left in Europe.' Willems, however, in his  bibliography of the Elzeviers published in 1880, enumerates some thirty  copies, and states that the highest price yet paid for the Pastissier  was 10,000 francs. But that was for a quite exceptional copy. From 4,500  francs to 5,500 francs seems to have been the average value of the book  in Willems' time, and, enthusiast as he is, he hesitates not to describe  it as a 'bouquin insignifiant et mediocrement imprime.'    Its scarcity at the present day is, perhaps, not surprising; for, from  the very nature of its contents, its habitat must always have been the  kitchen rather than the library. How long would such a tiny volume, with  its 130 thin paper leaves, bear the rough and greasy handling of chefs  and 'pastissiers'?

Which is the better choice--the well-told tale of the Cathedrals of the  North, with their procession of kingly visitors, or the almost untold  story of the Cathedrals of the South, where history is still legend,  tradition, romance--the story of fanatic fervour and still more fanatic  hate?    [Illustration: A CLOISTER OF THE SOUTH.--ELNE.]          II.    ARCHITECTURE IN PROVENCE, LANGUEDOC, AND GASCONY.      No better place can be found than the Mediterranean provinces to  consider the origins of the earliest southern style. Here Romanesque  Cathedrals arose in the midst of the vast ruins of Imperial antiquity,  here they developed strange similarities to foreign styles, domes  suggesting the East, Greek motives recalling Byzantium, and details  reminiscent of Syria. And here is the battle-field for that great army  who decry or who defend Roman influences. Some would have us believe  that the Romanesque dome is expatriated from the East; others, that it  is naturalised; others, that it is native. The plan of the Romanesque  dome differs very much from that of the Byzantine, yet the general  conception seems Eastern. If conceivable in the Oriental mind, why not  in that of the West? And yet, in spite of some native peculiarities of  structure, why should not the general idea have been imported? Who shall  decide? In a book such as this, mooted questions which involve such  multitudinous detail and such unprovable argument cannot be discussed.    It is unreasonable to doubt, however, that Roman influences dominated  the South, herself a product of Roman civilisation; and as in the  curious ineradicable tendency of the South toward heresy we more than  suspect a subtle infiltration of Greek and Oriental perversions, so in  architecture it is logical to infer that Mediterranean traders,  Crusaders, and perhaps adventurous architects who may have travelled in  their wake, brought rumours of the buildings of the East, which were  adopted with original or necessary modifications. Viollet-le-Duc, in  summing up this much discussed question, has written that \"in the  Romanesque art of the West, side by side with persistent Latin  traditions, a Byzantine influence is almost always found, evidenced by  the introduction of the cupola.\" In the lamentable absence of records of  the majority of Cathedrals, reasonings of origin must be inductive, and  more or less imaginative, and have no legitimate place in the scope of a  book which aims to describe the existing conditions and proven history  of southern Cathedrals.    [Illustration: A ROMANESQUE AISLE.--ARLES.]    Quicherat, who has had much to say upon architectural subjects, defines  the Romanesque as an art \"which has ceased to be Roman, although it has  much that is Roman, and that is not yet Gothic, although it already  presages the Gothic.\" This is not a very helpful interpretation.  Romanesque, as it exists in France to-day, is generally of earlier  building than the Gothic; it is an older and far simpler style. It was  not a quick, brilliant outburst, like the Gothic, but a long and slow  evolution; and it has therefore deliberation and dignity, not the  spontaneity of northern creations; strength, and at times great vigour,  but not munificence, not the lavishness of art and wealth and adornment,  of which the younger style was prodigal. Few generalisations are  flawless, but it may be truly said that Romanesque Cathedrals are  lacking in splendour; and it will be found in a large majority of cases  that they are also without the impressiveness of great size; that they  are almost devoid of shapely windows or stained glass, of notable  carvings or richness of decorative detail. Their art is a simple art, a  sober art, and in its nearest approach to opulence--the sculptured  portals of Saint-Trophime of Arles or Saint-Gilles-de-Languedoc--there  is still a reserved rather than an exuberant and uncontrolled display of  wealth.    [Illustration: \"THE SCULPTURED PORTALS OF SAINT-TROPHIME.\"--ARLES.]    By what simple, superficial sign can this architecture be recognised by  those who are to see it for the first time? It exists \"everywhere and  always\" in southern France; but, side by side with the encroachments  and additions of other styles, how can it be easily distinguished?  Quicherat writes that the principal characteristic of the Romanesque is  \"la voute,\" and the great, rounded tunnel of the roofing is a  distinction which will be found in no other form. But the easiest of  superficial distinctions is the arch-shape, which in portal, window,  vaulting or tympanum is round; wherever the arcaded form is  used,--always round. With this suggestion of outline, and the universal  principles of the style, simplicity and dignity and absence of great  ornamentation, the untechnical traveller may distinguish the Romanesque  of the South, and if he be akin to the traveller who tells these  Cathedral tales, the interest and fascination which the old architecture  awakes, will lead him to discover for himself the many differences which  are evident between the ascetic strength of the one, and the splendour  and brilliance of the other.      [Sidenote: Provence.]    [Illustration: A GOTHIC AISLE.--MENDE.]    The three provinces which compose the South of France are Provence,  Languedoc, and Gascony, and of these Provence is, architecturally and  historically, the first to claim our interest. During the era of  colonisation it was the most thoroughly romanised, and in the early  centuries of Christianity the first to fall completely under the  systematic organisation of the Church. It has a large group of very old  Cathedrals, and is the best study-ground for a general scrutiny and  appreciation of that style which the builders of the South assimilated  and developed until, as it were, they naturalised it and made it one  of the two greatest forms of architectural expression. Provence does not  contain the most impressive examples of Romanesque. Two Abbeys of the  far Norman North are more finished and harmonious representations of the  art, and Languedoc, in the basilica of Saint-Sernin of Toulouse, has a  nobler interior than any in the Midi, and many other churches of  Languedoc and Gascony are most interesting examples of a style which  belonged to them as truly as to Provence.    Yet it is in this province that the Romanesque is best studied. For here  the great internecine struggles--both political and religious--of the  Middle Ages were not as devastating as in Languedoc and Gascony;  Provence was a sunny land, where Sonnets flourished more luxuriantly  than did Holy Inquisition. Her churches have therefore been preserved in  their original form in greater numbers than those of the two other  provinces. They are of all types of Romanesque, all stages of its  growth, from the small and simple Cathedrals which were built when  ecclesiastical exchequers were not overflowing, to the greater ones  which illustrate very advanced and dignified phases of architectural  development; and as a whole they exhibit the normal proportion of  failure and success in an effort toward an ideal.      [Sidenote: Languedoc.]    Leon Renier, the learned lecturer of the College de France, says: \"It is  remarkable that the changes, the elaborations, the modifications of the  architecture given by Rome to all countries under her domination were  conceived in the provinces long before they were reproduced in Italy.  Rome gave no longer; she received ... a transfusion of a new blood, more  vital and more rich.\" In Languedoc, the greater number of monuments of  this ancient architecture have been destroyed; and those of their  outgrowth, the later Romanesque, were so repeatedly mutilated that the  Cathedrals of this province present even a greater confusion of  originalities, restorations, and additions than those of Provence. To a  multitude of dates must be added corresponding differences in style.  Each school of architecture naturally considered that it had somewhat of  a monopoly of good taste and beauty, or at least that it was an  improvement on the manner which preceded it; and it would have been too  much to expect, in ages when anachronisms were unrecognised, that  churches should have been restored in their consonant, original style.  Architects of the Gothic period were unable to resist the temptation of  continuing a Romanesque nave with a choir of their own school, and  builders of the XVIII century went still further and added a showy Louis  XV facade to a modest Romanesque Cathedral. Some churches, built in  times of religious storm and stress, show the preoccupation of their  patrons or the lack of talent of their constructors; others belong to  Bishoprics that were much more lately constituted than the Sees of  Provence, and in these cases the new prelate chose a church already  begun or completed, and compromised with the demands of episcopal pomp  by an addition, usually of different style. The numerous changes,  political and religious, of the Mediaevalism of Languedoc, had such  considerable and diverse influence on the architecture of the  province that it is not possible, as in Provence, to trace an  uninterrupted evolution of one style. The Languedocian is generally a  later builder than the Provencal; he is bolder. Having the Romanesque  and the Gothic as choice, he chose at will and seemingly at random. He  had spontaneity, enthusiasm, verve; and when no accepted model pleased  his taste, he re-created after his own liking. Languedoc has therefore a  delightful quality that is wanting in Provence; and in her greater  Cathedrals there is often an originality that is due to genius rather  than to eccentricity. There is delicate Gothic at Carcassonne, lofty  Gothic at Narbonne, Sainte-Cecile of Albi is fortified Gothic built in  brick. The interior of Saint-Sernin of Toulouse is an"]]]
