While such a mood is  dominant, the need of logic is not felt, and accordingly the more  thoroughgoing mystics do not employ logic, but appeal directly to the  immediate deliverance of their insight. But such fully developed  mysticism is rare in the West. When the intensity of emotional  conviction subsides, a man who is in the habit of reasoning will  search for logical grounds in favour of the belief which he finds in  himself. But since the belief already exists, he will be very  hospitable to any ground that suggests itself. The paradoxes  apparently proved by his logic are really the paradoxes of mysticism,  and are the goal which he feels his logic must reach if it is to be in  accordance with insight. The resulting logic has rendered most  philosophers incapable of giving any account of the world of science  and daily life. If they had been anxious to give such an account, they  would probably have discovered the errors of their logic; but most of  them were less anxious to understand the world of science and daily  life than to convict it of unreality in the interests of a  super-sensible \"real\" world.    It is in this way that logic has been pursued by those of the great  philosophers who were mystics. But since they usually took for granted  the supposed insight of the mystic emotion, their logical doctrines  were presented with a certain dryness, and were believed by their  disciples to be quite independent of the sudden illumination from  which they sprang. Nevertheless their origin clung to them, and they  remained--to borrow a useful word from Mr. Santayana--\"malicious\" in  regard to the world of science and common sense. It is only so that we  can account for the complacency with which philosophers have accepted  the inconsistency of their doctrines with all the common and  scientific facts which seem best established and most worthy of  belief.    The logic of mysticism shows, as is natural, the defects which are  inherent in anything malicious. The impulse to logic, not felt while  the mystic mood is dominant, reasserts itself as the mood fades, but  with a desire to retain the vanishing insight, or at least to prove  that it _was_ insight, and that what seems to contradict it is  illusion. The logic which thus arises is not quite disinterested or  candid, and is inspired by a certain hatred of the daily world to  which it is to be applied. Such an attitude naturally does not tend to  the best results. Everyone knows that to read an author simply in  order to refute him is not the way to understand him; and to read the  book of Nature with a conviction that it is all illusion is just as  unlikely to lead to understanding. If our logic is to find the common  world intelligible, it must not be hostile, but must be inspired by a  genuine acceptance such as is not usually to be found among  metaphysicians.      III. TIME    The unreality of time is a cardinal doctrine of many metaphysical  systems, often nominally based, as already by Parmenides, upon logical  arguments, but originally derived, at any rate in the founders of new  systems, from the certainty which is born in the moment of mystic  insight. As a Persian Sufi poet says:        \"Past and future are what veil God from our sight.      Burn up both of them with fire! How long      Wilt thou be partitioned by these segments as a reed?\"[5]    The belief that what is ultimately real must be immutable is a very  common one: it gave rise to the metaphysical notion of substance, and  finds, even now, a wholly illegitimate satisfaction in such scientific  doctrines as the conservation of energy and mass.    It is difficult to disentangle the truth and the error in this view.  The arguments for the contention that time is unreal and that the  world of sense is illusory must, I think, be regarded as fallacious.  Nevertheless there is some sense--easier to feel than to state--in  which time is an unimportant and superficial characteristic of  reality. Past and future must be acknowledged to be as real as the  present, and a certain emancipation from slavery to time is essential  to philosophic thought. The importance of time is rather practical  than theoretical, rather in relation to our desires than in relation  to truth. A truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by  picturing things as entering into the stream of time from an eternal  world outside, than from a view which regards time as the devouring  tyrant of all that is. Both in thought and in feeling, even though  time be real, to realise the unimportance of time is the gate of  wisdom.    That this is the case may be seen at once by asking ourselves why our  feelings towards the past are so different from our feelings towards  the future. The reason for this difference is wholly practical: our  wishes can affect the future but not the past, the future is to some  extent subject to our power, while the past is unalterably fixed. But  every future will some day be past: if we see the past truly now, it  must, when it was still future, have been just what we now see it to  be, and what is now future must be just what we shall see it to be  when it has become past. The felt difference of quality between past  and future, therefore, is not an intrinsic difference, but only a  difference in relation to us: to impartial contemplation, it ceases to  exist. And impartiality of contemplation is, in the intellectual  sphere, that very same virtue of disinterestedness which, in the  sphere of action, appears as justice and unselfishness. Whoever wishes  to see the world truly, to rise in thought above the tyranny of  practical desires, must learn to overcome the difference of attitude  towards past and future, and to survey the whole stream of time in one  comprehensive vision.    The kind of way in which, as it seems to me, time ought not to enter  into our theoretic philosophical thought, may be illustrated by the  philosophy which has become associated with the idea of evolution, and  which is exemplified by Nietzsche, pragmatism, and Bergson. This  philosophy, on the basis of the development which has led from the  lowest forms of life up to man, sees in _progress_ the fundamental law  of the universe, and thus admits the difference between _earlier_ and  _later_ into the very citadel of its contemplative outlook. With its  past and future history of the world, conjectural as it is, I do not  wish to quarrel. But I think that, in the intoxication of a quick  success, much that is required for a true understanding of the  universe has been forgotten. Something of Hellenism, something, too,  of Oriental resignation, must be combined with its hurrying Western  self-assertion before it can emerge from the ardour of youth into the  mature wisdom of manhood. In spite of its appeals to science, the true  scientific philosophy, I think, is something more arduous and more  aloof, appealing to less mundane hopes, and requiring a severer  discipline for its successful practice.    Darwin's _Origin of Species_ persuaded the world that the difference  between different species of animals and plants is not the fixed  immutable difference that it appears to be. The doctrine of natural  kinds, which had rendered classification easy and definite, which was  enshrined in the Aristotelian tradition, and protected by its supposed  necessity for orthodox dogma, was suddenly swept away for ever out of  the biological world. The difference between man and the lower  animals, which to our human conceit appears enormous, was shown to be  a gradual achievement, involving intermediate being who could not with  certainty be placed either within or without the human family. The sun  and the planets had already been shown by Laplace to be very probably  derived from a primitive more or less undifferentiated nebula. Thus  the old fixed landmarks became wavering and indistinct, and all sharp  outlines were blurred. Things and species lost their boundaries, and  none could say where they began or where they ended.    But if human conceit was staggered for a moment by its kinship with  the ape, it soon found a way to reassert itself, and that way is the  \"philosophy\" of evolution. A process which led from the amoeba to Man  appeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress--though  whether the amoeba would agree with this opinion is not known. Hence  the cycle of changes which science had shown to be the probable  history of the past was welcomed as revealing a law of development  towards good in the universe--an evolution or unfolding of an idea  slowly embodying itself in the actual. But such a view, though it  might satisfy Spencer and those whom we may call Hegelian  evolutionists, could not be accepted as adequate by the more  whole-hearted votaries of change. An ideal to which the world  continuously approaches is, to these minds, too dead and static to be  inspiring. Not only the aspiration, but the ideal too, must change and  develop with the course of evolution: there must be no fixed goal, but  a continual fashioning of fresh needs by the impulse which is life and  which alone gives unity to the process.    Life, in this philosophy, is a continuous stream, in which all  divisions are artificial and unreal. Separate things, beginnings and  endings, are mere convenient fictions: there is only smooth unbroken  transition. The beliefs of to-day may count as true to-day, if they  carry us along the stream; but to-morrow they will be false, and must  be replaced by new beliefs to meet the new situation. All our thinking  consists of convenient fictions, imaginary congealings of the stream:  reality flows on in spite of all our fictions, and though it can be  lived, it cannot be conceived in thought.

I didn't want to read it.  Perhaps he was ashamed of being always  writing letters.  Don't matter to me.  Afraid, perhaps, that he'll be  told that he ought to attend more to teaching me.  Wish he'd be always  writing letters.  I can learn twice as much reading with mother.\"    It was very beautiful in that sunny niche in the mouldering stones close  to the tower farthest away from that occupied by the secretary, and a  spot much favoured by the boy, for from there he could look right over  the square gate-way with its flanking towers, and the drawbridge which  was never drawn, and the portcullis which was never lowered.    \"Can't hear him playing here,\" thought Roy that day; and he  congratulated himself upon the fact, without pausing to think that the  distance was so short that the notes should have been audible.    Roy had been successful in getting off his reading with the tutor, but  he was very undecided what to do next, for there were so many things to  tempt him, and his mind kept on running in different directions.  One  minute he was dwelling on his mother's troubles and the want of news  from his father, and from this it was a natural transition to thinking  of how grand it would be if he could prevail upon her to let him go up  to that far-away mysterious city, which it took days to reach on  horseback, and then he could take her letter and find where his father  was lying with his regiment, and see the army,--maybe see the king and  queen, and perhaps his father might let him stay there,--at all events  for a time.    Then he was off to thinking about the great moat, for twice over a  splash rose to his ears, and he could see the rings of water which  spread out and made the lily-leaves rise and fall.    \"That was the big tench,\" he said to himself.  \"Must catch that fellow  some day.  He must weigh six or seven pounds.  It ought to be a good  time now.  Want a strong line, though, and a big hook, for he'd run in  and out among the lily-stems and break mine.  Now, if I knew where  father was, I could write and ask him to buy me one and send it down by  his next letter.  No: he wouldn't want to be bothered to buy me  fishing-lines when he's with his regiment.  I know,\" he said to himself,  after a pause; \"old Ben has got the one he caught the big eel with.  I'll make him lend me that.  Poor old Ben! who'd ever have thought that  he could cry.  For it was crying just as a little boy would.  Seems  funny, because he has been a brave soldier, and saved father's life  once.  Shouldn't have thought a man like that could cry.\"    Roy began to whistle softly, and then picked up a little cushion-like  patch of velvety green moss and pitched it down towards a jackdaw that  was sitting on a projecting stone just below a hole, watching him  intently, first with one eye and then with the other, as if puzzled to  know what he was doing so near to his private residence, where his wife  was sitting upon a late batch of eggs, an accident connected with rats  having happened to the first.    It did not occur to the bird that it was quite impossible for its  nesting-place to be reached without a swing down from above by a rope;  but, being still puzzled, it tried to sharpen its intellectual faculties  by standing on one leg and scratching its grey poll with the claws of  the other, a feat which made it unsteady and nearly topple over towards  the deep moat below.    \"_Tah_!\" it cried, in resentment of the insult when the little green  moss cushion was thrown; and, as the bird sailed away, Roy rose and  walked slowly along the rampart, through the corner tower, and then on  towards the front, where that over the outer gate-way stood tall,  massive, and square.  Here the boy left the rampart, entered through a  low arched door, and stood in the great chamber over the main gate-way,  where the rusty chains were wound round the two capstans, held fast now  by their checks, and suspending the huge grated portcullis, with its  spikes high enough to be clear of a coachman driving a carriage.    \"Wonder whether we could let that down?\" thought Roy.    He had often had the same thought, but it came very strongly now, and he  began to calculate how many men it would take to lower the portcullis,  and whether he, Ben, and a couple more could manage it.    \"Looks as if everything must be set fast with rust,\" he thought, and he  was about to turn and descend; but as he reached the corner where the  spiral steps led down, he stood where they also led up to another  chamber in the massive stone-work, and again higher to the leads.    The result was that in his idle mood Roy began to ascend, to find  half-way up, by the slit which gave light, that the jackdaws had been  busy there too, coming in and out by the loop-hole, and building a nest  which was supported upon a scaffolding of sticks which curved up from  the stone step on which it rested, and from that to the splay and sill  by the loop-hole.    \"Only an old one,\" said the boy to himself, and he brought the great  edifice down with a sharp kick or two, thinking that it must be about a  year since any one had come up that way.    \"What a lot of the old place seems no use!\" he said to himself, as, with  the dry sticks crackling beneath his feet, he climbed up the dark  stairway and entered the next chamber through its low arched door.    \"Why, what a jolly private room this would make!\" he said to himself;  \"only wants a casement in and some furniture.  I'll ask father to let me  have it for my play--I mean study; no, I don't--I mean odds and ends  place.\"    He paused--after glancing out at the beautiful view over the woodland  country dotted with meadow-like pastures in which the ruddy cattle of  the county grazed--by the open fireplace with the arms of the Roylands  cut in stone beneath the narrow shelf, and the sight of this opening,  with the narrow, well-made chimney and some projecting stone blocks from  the fire-back, set him thinking.    \"Fight differently now,\" he said, as he recalled the object of the  furnace before him, and how he had heard or read that it was used on  purpose to melt lead ready for pouring down upon the besiegers who might  have forced their way across the drawbridge to the portcullis.  \"Fancy  melting lead here to pour down upon men's heads!  What wretches we must  have been in the old days.\"    He altered his mind, though, directly, as he went back to the stairway.    \"Perhaps we never did pour any down, for I don't think anybody ever did  attack the castle.\"    Thinking he might as well go a little higher, he mounted the spiral  instead of descending, the dry elm twigs brought in by the jackdaws  which made the untenanted corners their home crackling again beneath his  feet.    Passing out of the corner turret, which supported a stout, new  flag-pole, he was now on the leaded roof of the great square tower,  which frowned down upon the drawbridge and gazed over the outer  gate-way, in whose tower old Jenkin Bray, the porter, dwelt, and whom  Roy could now see sitting beside the modern iron gate sunning himself,  his long white hair and beard glistening in the light.    There were openings for heavy guns in front here, and a broad, level,  projecting parapet with a place where the defenders could kneel, and  which looked like a broad seat at the first glance, while at its foot  was a series of longish, narrow, funnel-shaped openings, over which the  boy stood, gazing down through them at the entrance to the main  gate-way, noting how thoroughly they commanded the front of where the  portcullis would stand when dropped, and where any enemies attacking and  trying to break through would be exposed to a terrible shower of molten  lead, brought up from the furnace in the chamber below to pour down upon  the besiegers, while those who assailed them were in perfect safety.    \"Horrid!\" muttered Roy; \"but I don't know; the enemy should stop away  and leave the people in the castle alone.  But hot lead!  Boiling water  wouldn't seem so bad.  But surely Master Pawson's friend is wrong; we  can't be going to have war here in England.  Well, if we do, there's  nothing to bring them here.\"    Roy left the machicolations and knelt upon the broad stone seat-like  place to stretch himself across the parapet, and look down, over the  narrow patch of stone paving, down into the deep moat, whose waters were  lit up by the sunshine, so that the boy could see the lily and other  water-plant stems and clumps of reed mace; at the farther edge the great  water-docks and plantains, with the pink-blossomed rush.  But his  attention was wholly riveted by the fish which swarmed in the sunny  depths, and for a time he lay there upon his breast, kicking up his  heels and studying the broad-backed carp, some of which old age had  decked with patches of greyish mould.  There were fat tench, too,  walloping about among the lilies, and appearing to enjoy the pleasure of  forcing their way in and out among the leaves and stems; while the carp  sailed about in the open water, basking in the sunshine, and seemed to  find their satisfaction in leaping bodily out of the water to fall back  with a splash.    There were roach, too, in shoals, and what seemed remarkable was that  they kept swimming close up to where a great pike of nearly three feet  long lay motionless, close to a patch of weed.    \"Must be asleep,\" thought Roy, \"or not hungry, and they all know it,  because he would soon snap up half a dozen of them.\"    Then, as he lay lazily watching the fish in the drowsy sunshine which  had warmed the stones, the political troubles of the nation and the  great cloud of war, with its lightnings, destruction, and death, were  unseen.  He was surrounded by peace in the happiest days of boyhood, and  trouble seemed as if it could not exist.  But the trumpet-blast had rung  out the call to arms, and men were flocking to that standard and to  this, and the flash and thunder"]]]
