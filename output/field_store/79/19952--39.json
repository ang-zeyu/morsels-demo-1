But when he had made slaves of the citizens of all these cities, the  nation of the Jews made an insurrection against him at a festival; for  at those feasts seditions are generally begun; and it looked as if he  should not be able to escape the plot they had laid for him, had not his  foreign auxiliaries, the Pisidians and Cilicians, assisted him; for as  to the Syrians, he never admitted them among his mercenary troops, on  account of their innate enmity against the Jewish nation. And when he  had slain more than six thousand of the rebels, he made an incursion  into Arabia; and when he had taken that country, together with the  Gileadires and Moabites, he enjoined them to pay him tribute, and  returned to Areathus; and as Theodorus was surprised at his great  success, he took the fortress, and demolished it.    4. However, when he fought with Obodas, king of the Arabians, who had  laid an ambush for him near Golan, and a plot against him, he lost his  entire army, which was crowded together in a deep valley, and broken to  pieces by the multitude of camels. And when he had made his escape to  Jerusalem, he provoked the multitude, which hated him before, to make  an insurrection against him, and this on account of the greatness of the  calamity that he was under. However, he was then too hard for them; and,  in the several battles that were fought on both sides, he slew not fewer  than fifty thousand of the Jews in the interval of six years. Yet had  he no reason to rejoice in these victories, since he did but consume his  own kingdom; till at length he left off fighting, and endeavored to  come to a composition with them, by talking with his subjects. But this  mutability and irregularity of his conduct made them hate him still  more. And when he asked them why they so hated him, and what he should  do in order to appease them, they said, by killing himself; for that it  would be then all they could do to be reconciled to him, who had done  such tragical things to them, even when he was dead. At the same time  they invited Demetrius, who was called Eucerus, to assist them; and as  he readily complied with their requests, in hopes of great advantages,  and came with his army, the Jews joined with those their auxiliaries  about Shechem.    5. Yet did Alexander meet both these forces with one thousand horsemen,  and eight thousand mercenaries that were on foot. He had also with him  that part of the Jews which favored him, to the number of ten thousand;  while the adverse party had three thousand horsemen, and fourteen  thousand footmen. Now, before they joined battle, the kings made  proclamation, and endeavored to draw off each other's soldiers, and make  them revolt; while Demetrius hoped to induce Alexander's mercenaries  to leave him, and Alexander hoped to induce the Jews that were with  Demetrius to leave him. But since neither the Jews would leave off their  rage, nor the Greeks prove unfaithful, they came to an engagement, and  to a close fight with their weapons. In which battle Demetrius was  the conqueror, although Alexander's mercenaries showed the greatest  exploits, both in soul and body. Yet did the upshot of this battle prove  different from what was expected, as to both of them; for neither did  those that invited Demetrius to come to them continue firm to him,  though he was conqueror; and six thousand Jews, out of pity to the  change of Alexander's condition, when he was fled to the mountains,  came over to him. Yet could not Demetrius bear this turn of affairs; but  supposing that Alexander was already become a match for him again, and  that all the nation would [at length] run to him, he left the country,  and went his way.    6. However, the rest of the [Jewish] multitude did not lay aside their  quarrels with him, when the [foreign] auxiliaries were gone; but they  had a perpetual war with Alexander, until he had slain the greatest part  of them, and driven the rest into the city Berneselis; and when he had  demolished that city, he carried the captives to Jerusalem. Nay, his  rage was grown so extravagant, that his barbarity proceeded to the  degree of impiety; for when he had ordered eight hundred to be hung upon  crosses in the midst of the city, he had the throats of their wives and  children cut before their eyes; and these executions he saw as he  was drinking and lying down with his concubines. Upon which so deep a  surprise seized on the people, that eight thousand of his opposers  fled away the very next night, out of all Judea, whose flight was only  terminated by Alexander's death; so at last, though not till late,  and with great difficulty, he, by such actions, procured quiet to his  kingdom, and left off fighting any more.    7. Yet did that Antiochus, who was also called Dionysius, become an  origin of troubles again. This man was the brother of Demetrius, and the  last of the race of the Seleucidae. 3 Alexander was afraid of him, when  he was marching against the Arabians; so he cut a deep trench between  Antipatris, which was near the mountains, and the shores of Joppa; he  also erected a high wall before the trench, and built wooden towers,  in order to hinder any sudden approaches. But still he was not able to  exclude Antiochus, for he burnt the towers, and filled up the trenches,  and marched on with his army. And as he looked upon taking his  revenge on Alexander, for endeavoring to stop him, as a thing of less  consequence, he marched directly against the Arabians, whose king  retired into such parts of the country as were fittest for engaging the  enemy, and then on the sudden made his horse turn back, which were in  number ten thousand, and fell upon Antiochus's army while they were in  disorder, and a terrible battle ensued. Antiochus's troops, so long as  he was alive, fought it out, although a mighty slaughter was made among  them by the Arabians; but when he fell, for he was in the forefront, in  the utmost danger, in rallying his troops, they all gave ground, and the  greatest part of his army were destroyed, either in the action or the  flight; and for the rest, who fled to the village of Cana, it happened  that they were all consumed by want of necessaries, a few only excepted.    8. About this time it was that the people of Damascus, out of their  hatred to Ptolemy, the son of Menhens, invited Aretas [to take the  government], and made him king of Celesyria. This man also made an  expedition against Judea, and beat Alexander in battle; but afterwards  retired by mutual agreement. But Alexander, when he had taken  Pella, marched to Gerasa again, out of the covetous desire he had of  Theodorus's possessions; and when he had built a triple wall about the  garrison, he took the place by force. He also demolished Golan, and  Seleucia, and what was called the Valley of Antiochus; besides which,  he took the strong fortress of Gamala, and stripped Demetrius, who was  governor therein, of what he had, on account of the many crimes laid to  his charge, and then returned into Judea, after he had been three whole  years in this expedition. And now he was kindly received of the nation,  because of the good success he had. So when he was at rest from war,  he fell into a distemper; for he was afflicted with a quartan ague, and  supposed that, by exercising himself again in martial affairs, he  should get rid of this distemper; but by making such expeditions at  unseasonable times, and forcing his body to undergo greater hardships  than it was able to bear, he brought himself to his end. He died,  therefore, in the midst of his troubles, after he had reigned seven and  twenty years.              CHAPTER 5.           Alexandra Reigns Nine Years, During Which Time The Pharisees       Were The Real Rulers Of The Nation.    1. Now Alexander left the kingdom to Alexandra his wife, and depended  upon it that the Jews would now very readily submit to her, because she  had been very averse to such cruelty as he had treated them with,  and had opposed his violation of their laws, and had thereby got the  good-will of the people. Nor was he mistaken as to his expectations; for  this woman kept the dominion, by the opinion that the people had of her  piety; for she chiefly studied the ancient customs of her country, and  cast those men out of the government that offended against their holy  laws. And as she had two sons by Alexander, she made Hyrcanus the elder  high priest, on account of his age, as also, besides that, on account of  his inactive temper, no way disposing him to disturb the public. But  she retained the younger, Aristobulus, with her as a private person, by  reason of the warmth of his temper.    2. And now the Pharisees joined themselves to her, to assist her in  the government. These are a certain sect of the Jews that appear more  religious than others, and seem to interpret the laws more accurately.  Now Alexandra hearkened to them to an extraordinary degree, as being  herself a woman of great piety towards God. But these Pharisees artfully  insinuated themselves into her favor by little and little, and became  themselves the real administrators of the public affairs: they banished  and reduced whom they pleased; they bound and loosed [men] at their  pleasure; 4 and, to say all at once, they had the enjoyment of the royal  authority, whilst the expenses and the difficulties of it belonged to  Alexandra. She was a sagacious woman in the management of great  affairs, and intent always upon gathering soldiers together; so that she  increased the army the one half, and procured a great body of foreign  troops, till her own nation became not only very powerful at home, but  terrible also to foreign potentates, while she governed other people,  and the Pharisees governed her.    3. Accordingly, they themselves slew Diogenes, a person of figure,  and one that had been a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#5)"],[1,"hed,--and free visitors, whom the ease of life and  the prospects of fortune enticed to the gigantic city; there was no lack  of venal persons. There were priests of Serapis, with palm branches in  their hands; priests of Isis, to whose altar more offerings were brought  than to the temple of the Capitoline Jove; priests of Cybele, bearing  in their hands golden ears of rice; and priests of nomad divinities; and  dancers of the East with bright head-dresses, and dealers in amulets,  and snake-tamers, and Chaldean seers; and, finally, people without any  occupation whatever, who applied for grain every week at the storehouses  on the Tiber, who fought for lottery-tickets to the Circus, who spent  their nights in rickety houses of districts beyond the Tiber, and sunny  and warm days under covered porticos, and in foul eating-houses of the  Subura, on the Milvian bridge, or before the \"insulae\" of the great,  where from time to time remnants from the tables of slaves were thrown  out to them.    Petronius was well known to those crowds. Vinicius's ears were  struck continually by \"Hic est!\" (Here he is). They loved him for his  munificence; and his peculiar popularity increased from the time when  they learned that he had spoken before Caesar in opposition to the  sentence of death issued against the whole \"familia,\" that is, against  all the slaves of the prefect Pedanius Secundus, without distinction of  sex or age, because one of them had killed that monster in a moment of  despair. Petronius repeated in public, it is true, that it was all one  to him, and that he had spoken to Caesar only privately, as the arbiter  elegantiarum whose aesthetic taste was offended by a barbarous slaughter  befitting Scythians and not Romans. Nevertheless, people who were  indignant because of the slaughter loved Petronius from that moment  forth. But he did not care for their love. He remembered that that crowd  of people had loved also Britannicus, poisoned by Nero; and Agrippina,  killed at his command; and Octavia, smothered in hot steam at the  Pandataria, after her veins had been opened previously; and Rubelius  Plautus, who had been banished; and Thrasea, to whom any morning might  bring a death sentence. The love of the mob might be considered rather  of ill omen; and the sceptical Petronius was superstitious also. He had  a twofold contempt for the multitude,--as an aristocrat and an aesthetic  person. Men with the odor of roast beans, which they carried in their  bosoms, and who besides were eternally hoarse and sweating from playing  mora on the street-corners and peristyles, did not in his eyes deserve  the term \"human.\" Hence he gave no answer whatever to the applause,  or the kisses sent from lips here and there to him. He was relating to  Marcus the case of Pedanius, reviling meanwhile the fickleness of that  rabble which, next morning after the terrible butchery, applauded Nero  on his way to the temple of Jupiter Stator. But he gave command to  halt before the book-shop of Avirnus, and, descending from the litter,  purchased an ornamented manuscript, which he gave to Vinicius.    \"Here is a gift for thee,\" said he.    \"Thanks!\" answered Vinicius. Then, looking at the title, he inquired,  \"'Satyricon'? Is this something new? Whose is it?\"    \"Mine. But I do not wish to go in the road of Rufinus, whose history I  was to tell thee, nor of Fabricius Veiento; hence no one knows of this,  and do thou mention it to no man.\"    \"Thou hast said that thou art no writer of verses,\" said Vinicius,  looking at the middle of the manuscript; \"but here I see prose thickly  interwoven with them.\"    \"When thou art reading, turn attention to Trimalchion's feast. As to  verses, they have disgusted me, since Nero is writing an epic. Vitelius,  when he wishes to relieve himself, uses ivory fingers to thrust down his  throat; others serve themselves with flamingo feathers steeped in olive  oil or in a decoction of wild thyme. I read Nero's poetry, and the  result is immediate. Straightway I am able to praise it, if not with a  clear conscience, at least with a clear stomach.\"    When he had said this, he stopped the litter again before the shop of  Idomeneus the goldsmith, and, having settled the affair of the gems,  gave command to bear the litter directly to Aulus's mansion.    \"On the road I will tell thee the story of Rufinus,\" said he, \"as proof  of what vanity in an author may be.\"    But before he had begun, they turned in to the Vicus Patricius, and  soon found themselves before the dwelling of Aulus. A young and sturdy  \"janitor\" opened the door leading to the ostium, over which a magpie  confined in a cage greeted them noisily with the word, \"Salve!\"    On the way from the second antechamber, called the ostium, to the atrium  itself, Vinicius said,--\"Hast noticed that thee doorkeepers are  without chains?\" \"This is a wonderful house,\" answered Petronius, in  an undertone. \"Of course it is known to thee that Pomponia Graecina is  suspected of entertaining that Eastern superstition which consists in  honoring a certain Chrestos. It seems that Crispinilla rendered her  this service,--she who cannot forgive Pomponia because one husband has  sufficed her for a lifetime. A one-man Woman! To-day, in Rome, it is  easier to get a half-plate of fresh mushrooms from Noricum than to find  such. They tried her before a domestic court--\"    \"To thy judgment this is a wonderful house. Later on I will tell thee  what I heard and saw in it.\"    Meanwhile they had entered the atrium. The slave appointed to it, called  atriensis, sent a nomenclator to announce the guests; and Petronius,  who, imagining that eternal sadness reigned in this severe house, had  never been in it, looked around with astonishment, and as it were with a  feeling of disappointment, for the atrium produced rather an impression  of cheerfulness. A sheaf of bright light falling from above through  a large opening broke into a thousand sparks on a fountain in a  quadrangular little basin, called the impluvium, which was in the middle  to receive rain falling through the opening during bad weather; this  was surrounded by anemones and lilies. In that house a special love for  lilies was evident, for there were whole clumps of them, both white and  red; and, finally, sapphire irises, whose delicate leaves were as if  silvered from the spray of the fountain. Among the moist mosses, in  which lily-pots were hidden, and among the bunches of lilies were little  bronze statues representing children and water-birds. In one corner a  bronze fawn, as if wishing to drink, was inclining its greenish head,  grizzled, too, by dampness. The floor of the atrium was of mosaic; the  walls, faced partly with red marble and partly with wood, on which were  painted fish, birds, and griffins, attracted the eye by the play of  colors. From the door to the side chamber they were ornamented with  tortoise-shell or even ivory; at the walls between the doors were  statues of Aulus's ancestors. Everywhere calm plenty was evident, remote  from excess, but noble and self-trusting.    Petronius, who lived with incomparably greater show and elegance, could  find nothing which offended his taste; and had just turned to Vinicius  with that remark, when a slave, the velarius, pushed aside the curtain  separating the atrium from the tablinum, and in the depth of the  building appeared Aulus Plautius approaching hurriedly.    He was a man nearing the evening of life, with a head whitened by hoar  frost, but fresh, with an energetic face, a trifle too short, but still  somewhat eagle-like. This time there was expressed on it a certain  astonishment, and even alarm, because of the unexpected arrival of  Nero's friend, companion, and suggester.    Petronius was too much a man of the world and too quick not to notice  this; hence, after the first greetings, he announced with all the  eloquence and ease at his command that he had come to give thanks  for the care which his sister's son had found in that house, and that  gratitude alone was the cause of the visit, to which, moreover, he was  emboldened by his old acquaintance with Aulus.    Aulus assured him that he was a welcome guest; and as to gratitude, he  declared that he had that feeling himself, though surely Petronius did  not divine the cause of it.    In fact, Petronius did not divine it. In vain did he raise his hazel  eyes, endeavoring to remember the least service rendered to Aulus or to  any one. He recalled none, unless it might be that which he intended  to show Vinicius. Some such thing, it is true, might have happened  involuntarily, but only involuntarily.    \"I have great love and esteem for Vespasian, whose life thou didst  save,\" said Aulus, \"when he had the misfortune to doze while listening  to Nero's verses.\"    \"He was fortunate,\" replied Petronius, \"for he did not hear them; but  I will not deny that the matter might have ended with misfortune.  Bronzebeard wished absolutely to send a centurion to him with the  friendly advice to open his veins.\"    \"But thou, Petronius, laughed him out of it.\"    \"That is true, or rather it is not true. I told Nero that if Orpheus put  wild beasts to sleep with song, his triumph was equal, since he had put  Vespasian to sleep. Ahenobarbus may be blamed on condition that to a  small criticism a great flattery be added. Our gracious Augusta, Poppaea,  understands this to perfection.\"    \"Alas! such are the times,\" answered Aulus. \"I lack two front teeth,  knocked out by a stone from the hand of a Briton, I speak with a hiss;  still my happiest days were passed in Britain.\"    \"Because they were days of victory,\" added Vinicius.    But Petronius, alarmed lest the old general might begin a narrative of  his former wars, changed the conversation.    \"See,\" said he, \"in the neighborhood of Praeneste country people found  a dead wolf whelp with two heads; and during a storm about that  time lightning struck "]]]
