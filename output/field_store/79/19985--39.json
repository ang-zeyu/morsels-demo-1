[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995"],[0,"Tacitus on Germany (#5)"],[1,"; whence they might become a portion of the  Roman Empire. With them this honour still remains, as also the memorials  of their ancient association with us: for they are not under the  contempt of paying tribute, nor subject to be squeezed by the farmers of  the revenue. Free from all impositions and payments, and only set apart  for the purposes of fighting, they are reserved wholly for the wars,  in the same manner as a magazine of weapons and armour. Under the same  degree of homage are the nation of the Mattiacians. For such is the  might and greatness of the Roman People, as to have carried the awe and  esteem of their Empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient boundaries. Thus  the Mattiacians, living upon the opposite banks, enjoy a settlement and  limits of their own; yet in spirit and inclination are attached to  us: in other things resembling the Batavians, save that as they still  breathe their original air, still possess their primitive soil, they are  thence inspired with superior vigour and keenness. Amongst the people  of Germany I would not reckon those who occupy the lands which are  under decimation, though they be such as dwell beyond the Rhine and the  Danube. By several worthless and vagabond Gauls, and such as poverty  rendered daring, that region was seized as one belonging to no certain  possessor: afterwards it became a skirt of the Empire and part of a  province, upon the enlargement of our bounds and the extending of our  garrisons and frontier.    Beyond these are the Cattans, whose territories begin at the Hercynian  Forest, and consist not of such wide and marshy plains, as those of  the other communities contained within the vast compass of Germany; but  produce ranges of hills, such as run lofty and contiguous for a long  tract, then by degrees sink and decay. Moreover the Hercynian Forest  attends for a while its native Cattans, then suddenly forsakes them.  This people are distinguished with bodies more hardy and robust, compact  limbs, stern countenances, and greater vigour of spirit. For Germans,  they are men of much sense and address. They dignify chosen men, listen  to such as are set over them, know how to preserve their post, to  discern occasions, to rebate their own ardour and impatience; how  to employ the day, how to entrench themselves by night. They account  fortune amongst things slippery and uncertain, but bravery amongst such  as are never-failing and secure; and, what is exceeding rare nor ever to  be learnt but by a wholesome course of discipline, in the conduct of  the general they repose more assurance than in the strength of the  army. Their whole forces consist of foot, who besides their arms carry  likewise instruments of iron and their provisions. You may see other  Germans proceed equipped to battle, but the Cattans so as to conduct a  war. They rarely venture upon excursions or casual encounters. It is in  truth peculiar to cavalry, suddenly to conquer, or suddenly to fly. Such  haste and velocity rather resembles fear. Patience and deliberation are  more akin to intrepidity.    Moreover a custom, practised indeed in other nations of Germany, yet  very rarely and confined only to particulars more daring than the rest,  prevails amongst the Cattans by universal consent. As soon as they  arrive to maturity of years, they let their hair and beards continue to  grow, nor till they have slain an enemy do they ever lay aside this form  of countenance by vow sacred to valour. Over the blood and spoil of a  foe they make bare their face. They allege, that they have now acquitted  themselves of the debt and duty contracted by their birth, and rendered  themselves worthy of their country, worthy of their parents. Upon the  spiritless, cowardly and unwarlike, such deformity of visage still  remains. All the most brave likewise wear an iron ring (a mark of great  dishonour this in that nation) and retain it as a chain; till by killing  an enemy they become released. Many of the Cattans delight always to  bear this terrible aspect; and, when grown white through age, become  awful and conspicuous by such marks, both to the enemy and their own  countrymen. By them in all engagements the first assault is made: of  them the front of the battle is always composed, as men who in their  looks are singular and tremendous. For even during peace they abate  nothing in the grimness and horror of their countenance. They have no  house to inhabit, no land to cultivate, nor any domestic charge or care.  With whomsoever they come to sojourn, by him they are maintained; always  very prodigal of the substance of others, always despising what is their  own, till the feebleness of old age overtakes them, and renders them  unequal to the efforts of such rigid bravery.    Next to the Cattans, dwell the Usipians and Tencterians; upon the Rhine  now running in a channel uniform and certain, such as suffices for a  boundary. The Tencterians, besides their wonted glory in war, surpass in  the service and discipline of their cavalry. Nor do the Cattans derive  higher applause from their foot, than the Tencterians from their horse.  Such was the order established by their forefathers, and what their  posterity still pursue. From riding and exercising of horse, their  children borrow their pastimes; in this exercise the young men find  matter for emulating one another, and in this the old men take pleasure  to persevere. Horses are by the father bequeathed as part of his  household and family, horses are conveyed amongst the rights of  succession, and as such the son receives them; but not the eldest son,  like other effects, by priority of birth, but he who continues to be  signal in boldness and superior in war.    Contiguous to the Tencterians formerly dwelt the Bructerians, in whose  room it is said the Chamavians and Angrivarians are now settled; they  who expulsed and almost extirpated the Bructerians, with the concurrence  of the neighbouring nations: whether in detestation of their arrogance,  or allured by the love of spoil, or through the special favour of the  Gods towards us Romans. They in truth even vouchsafed to gratify us with  the sight of the battle. In it there fell above sixty thousand souls,  without a blow struck by the Romans; but, what is a circumstance  still more glorious, fell to furnish them with a spectacle of joy and  recreation. May the Gods continue and perpetuate amongst these nations,  if not any love for us, yet by all means this their animosity and hate  towards each other: since whilst the destiny of the Empire thus urges  it, fortune cannot more signally befriend us, than in sowing strife  amongst our foes.    The Angrivarians and Chamavians are enclosed behind, by the Dulgibinians  and Chasuarians; and by other nations not so much noted: before the  Frisians face them. The country of Frisia is divided into two; called  the greater and lesser, according to the measure of their strength. Both  nations stretch along the Rhine, quite to the ocean; and surround  vast lakes such as once have born Roman fleets. We have moreover even  ventured out from thence into the ocean, and upon its coasts common fame  has reported the pillars of Hercules to be still standing: whether it be  that Hercules ever visited these parts, or that to his renowned name we  are wont to ascribe whatever is grand and glorious everywhere. Neither  did Drusus who made the attempt, want boldness to pursue it: but the  roughness of the ocean withstood him, nor would suffer discoveries to  be made about itself, no more than about Hercules. Thenceforward the  enterprise was dropped: nay, more pious and reverential it seemed, to  believe the marvellous feats of the Gods than to know and to prove them.    Hitherto, I have been describing Germany towards the west. To the  northward, it winds away with an immense compass. And first of all  occurs the nation of the Chaucians; who though they begin immediately  at the confines of the Frisians, and occupy part of the shore, extend  so far as to border upon all the several people whom I have already  recounted; till at last, by a Circuit, they reach quite to the  boundaries of the Cattans. A region so vast, the Chaucians do not only  possess but fill; a people of all the Germans the most noble, such as  would rather maintain their grandeur by justice than violence. They live  in repose, retired from broils abroad, void of avidity to possess more,  free from a spirit of domineering over others. They provoke no wars,  they ravage no countries, they pursue no plunder. Of their bravery and  power, the chief evidence arises from hence, that, without wronging or  oppressing others, they are come to be superior to all. Yet they are all  ready to arm, and if an exigency require, armies are presently raised,  powerful and abounding as they are in men and horses; and even when they  are quiet and their weapons laid aside, their credit and name continue  equally high.    Along the side of the Chaucians and Cattans dwell the Cheruscans; a  people who finding no enemy to rouse them, were enfeebled by a peace  over lasting and uniform, but such as they failed not to nourish. A  conduct which proved more pleasing than secure; since treacherous is  that repose which you enjoy amongst neighbours that are very powerful  and very fond of rule and mastership. When recourse is once had to the  sword, modesty and fair dealing will be vainly pleaded by the weaker;  names these which are always assumed by the stronger. Thus the  Cheruscans, they who formerly bore the character of _good and upright_,  are now called _cowards and fools_; and the fortune of the Cattans  who subdued them, grew immediately to be wisdom. In the ruin of the  Cheruscans, the Fosians, also their neighbours, were involved; and in  their calamities bore an equal share, though in their prosperity they  had been weaker and less considered.    In the same winding tract of Germany live the Cimbrians,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#5)"],[1,"and  wintering south to the Middle States on the coast.    The Razor-billed Auk is in form similar to the Murres, but the bill is  very different, being deep and thin, and with the upper mandible rounded  at the tip. Entire upper parts black shading to brownish on the throat.  Under parts and tips of secondaries, white; line from eye to bill and  another across the middle of the bill, white. They nest in large numbers  on Bird Rock in company with the Murres and in still greater numbers off  the coast of Labrador. Their eggs are not placed in as exposed positions  as the Murres, being generally behind boulders or in crevices. This is  necessary because, not being of the pear-shaped form of the Murres, they  would be very apt to be dislodged if commonly placed on the narrow  ledges. The eggs vary endlessly in marking but do not show the  differences in ground color that the Murres do. The color is white,  grayish or buffy. But one egg is generally laid, although two are  sometimes found. Size 3.00 x 2.00. Data.--Bay of Fundy. June 17, 1891.  Single egg laid on bare rock in a crevice under loose rocks. Collector,  A. C. Bent.    [Illustration 033: Grayish white.] [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 32    33. GREAT AUK. _Plautus impennis._    Range.--Formerly the whole of the North Atlantic coasts. Now extinct.    These great auks formerly dwelt in large numbers on the islands of the  North Atlantic, but owing to their lack of the powers of flight and the  destructiveness of mankind, the living bird has disappeared from the  face of the earth. Although they were about thirty inches in length,  their wings were even smaller than those of the Razor-billed Auk, a bird  only eighteen inches in length. Although breeding off the coast of  Newfoundland, they appeared winters as far south as Virginia, performing  their migration by swimming alone. The last bird appears to have been  taken in 1844, and Funk Island, off the coast of Newfoundland, marks the  place of their disappearance from our shores. There are about seventy  known specimens of the bird preserved, and about the same number of  eggs. The immediate cause of the extinction of these birds was their  destruction for food by fishermen and immigrants, and later for the use  of their feathers commercially. The single egg that they laid was about  5.00 x 3.00 inches, the ground color was buffy white, and the spots  brownish and blackish. The markings varied in endless pattern as do  those of the smaller Auk. There are but two real eggs (plaster casts in  imitation of the Auks eggs are to be found in many collections) in  collections in this country, one in the Academy of Natural Science,  Philadelphia, and the other in the National Museum, at Washington.  Through the kindness of Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of Natural  Science, we are enabled to show a full-sized reproduction from a  photograph of the egg in their collection.    [Illustration 034: Great Auk Dovekie.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]  [Illustration: deco.]    Page 33    [Illustration 035: EGG OF THE GREAT AUK.  Photographed from the specimen in the Academy of Natural Science,  Philadelphia; not more than ten or twelve of these eggs are in this  country; the one figured is one of the best marked specimens.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 34    34. DOVEKIE. _Alle alle_.    Range.--Coasts and islands of the North Atlantic and East Arctic oceans,  breeding in the Arctic regions and wintering as far south as the Middle  States. The little Dovekie or Sea Dove is the smallest member of the  family, being only 8 inches in length, and is the only member of the  sub-family allinae. The form is very robust and the bill is short and  stout. In summer the plumage is black above; the throat and upper breast  are sooty brown, and the under parts are white, as are also the tips of  the secondaries and edges of the scapulars. They nest in large numbers  on the Rocky cliffs of islands in the East Arctic. Their single pale  greenish blue egg is placed in a crevice of the rocks. Size 1.80 x 1.25.  Data.--Greenland, June 8, 1893. Single egg laid in a crevice of a sea  cliff.

Order II. LONGIPENNES  SKUA AND JAEGERS. Family STERCORARIIDAE    Skuas and Jaegers are birds having a Gull or Tern-like form and with a  hooked bill, the base of which is covered with a scaly shield. They have  webbed feet and are able to swim and dive, but they commonly get their  living by preying upon the Gulls and Terns, overtaking them by their  superior speed and by their strength and ferocity forcing them to  relinquish their food. The Jaegers especially are one of the swiftest and  most graceful birds that fly.    Page 36    35. SKUA. _Megalestris skua_.    Range.--Coasts and islands of the North Atlantic, chiefly on the  European side; rare on the Atlantic coast of North America.    Skuas are large (22 inches in length) and very powerfully built birds,  having the general form of a Gull. Their whole plumage is a dingy  brownish black color, palest below. Breeds in Iceland and possibly on  some of the islands in Hudson Strait. The nest is a hollow on the ground  in the marsh grass and is lined with grass. The two eggs which they lay  have an olive greenish ground, spotted with dark brown. Size 2.75 x  1.90.      36. POMARINE JAEGER. _Stercorarius pomarinus._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, breeding within the Arctic Circle, more  commonly in the Old World.    In the breeding plumage, this Jaeger has the crown and face blackish;  back and sides of head, throat and under parts pure white, except the  pointed stiffened feathers of the neck which are yellow. Back, wings and  tail blackish, the latter with the two middle feathers lengthened about  four inches beyond the rest of the tail, and broad to the tips, which  are twisted so that the feathers are vertical. They breed throughout the  Arctic regions, but not as commonly in America as the following species.  The nest is on the ground in the marsh grass and is made of grass and  moss. They lay two and rarely three eggs of an olive brown or greenish  color. These are spotted with brown and black. Size 2.20 x 1.70.    [Illustration 038: Olive brown.]  [Illustration: Skua. Pomarine Jaeger.]  [Illustration: Deep olive brown.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 37    37. PARASITIC JAEGER. _Stercorarius parasiticus._    Range.--Northern Hemisphere, wintering south to South America.    The Parasitic Jaeger is very similar to the Pomarine except that the  central tail feathers are pointed and are straight instead of twisted.  It is an abundant bird in Alaska, breeding from the Aleutian Chain  northward.    They locate their nests in the highest parts of marshy places, the nest  itself being only a depression in the ground lined with grass and moss.  The two eggs have an olive greenish or brownish ground and are marked  with various shades of brown and black. Size 2.15 x 1.65.      38. LONG-TAILED JAEGER. _Stercorarius longicaudus._    Range.--Arctic America; south in winter to South America.    The long-tailed Jaeger is, according to length, the largest of the  Jaegers, being 21 in. long; this is, however, due to the long sharp  pointed central pair of tail feathers, which extend about eight inches  beyond the others, and from the most noticeable distinguishing point  from the former species. The plumages that have been described are the  light phases; all the Jaegers have a dark phase in which the plumage is a  nearly uniform sooty brown, lightest below.    The Long-tailed Jaegers are the most numerous in Alaska and are even more  graceful in flight than are the Gulls and Terns, floating, skimming,  sailing, plunging, and darting about with incredible swiftness and ease.  Like the others of this family, they pilfer their food from the Gulls,  and are also very destructive to young birds and eggs. Their eggs are  either laid on the bare ground or in a slight depression, scantily lined  with grasses. The eggs are indistinguishable from those of the preceding  species except that they average a trifle smaller. Size 2.10 x 1.50.    [Illustration 039: Brownish.]  [Illustration: Parastic Jaeger. Long-tailed Jaeger.]  [Illustration: Olive brown.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 38    GULLS and TERNS. Family LARIDAE    Gulls are webbed footed birds having a slight hook to the end of the  upper mandible. Their plumage is generally a silvery gray above and  white below. They nest in large colonies, some on the islands of fresh  water inland, but mostly on the sea coast. They procure their food from  the surface of the water, it consisting mostly of dead fish and refuse  matter, and crustacea which they gather from the waters edge. When tired  they rest upon the surface of the water, where they ride the largest  waves in perfect safety.    Terns are birds of similar plumage to the Gulls, but their forms are  less robust and the bills are generally longer and sharply pointed.  Their food consists chiefly of small fish which they secure by hovering  above the water, and then plunging upon them. They are less often seen  on the surface of the water than are the Gulls.    [Illustration 040: Walter Raine. CHARACTERISTIC NEST OF A LOON.]  [Illustration: Left hand margin.]    Page 39    39. IVORY GULL. _Pagophila alba._    Range.--Arctic regions; south in winter to the northern border of the  United States.    The little Snow Gull, as it is often called, is eighteen inches in  length. In the breeding season the plumage is entirely white; the bill  is tipped with yellow and there is a red ring around the eye. These  Gulls nest in large colonies in the Arctic Regions, placing their nests  on the high rocky cliffs. The nest is made of grass,"]]]
