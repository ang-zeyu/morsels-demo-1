It was  therefore necessary to try them separately. The audience was numerous  and splendid. Many peers were present. The Lord President and the two  Secretaries of State attended in order to prove that the papers  produced in Court were the same which Billop had brought to Whitehall. A  considerable number of judges appeared on the bench; and Holt presided.  A full report of the proceedings has come down to us, and well deserves  to be attentively studied, and to be compared with the reports of other  trials which had not long before taken place under the same roof. The  whole spirit of the tribunal had undergone in a few months a change so  complete that it might seem to have been the work of ages. Twelve years  earlier, unhappy Roman Catholics, accused of wickedness which had never  entered into their thoughts, had stood in that dock. The witnesses for  the Crown had repeated their hideous fictions amidst the applauding hums  of the audience. The judges had shared, or had pretended to share, the  stupid credulity and the savage passions of the populace, had exchanged  smiles and compliments with the perjured informers, had roared down  the arguments feebly stammered forth by the prisoners, and had not  been ashamed, in passing the sentence of death, to make ribald jests on  purgatory and the mass. As soon as the butchery of Papists was over, the  butchery of Whigs had commenced; and the judges had applied themselves  to their new work with even more than their old barbarity. To these  scandals the Revolution had put an end. Whoever, after perusing the  trials of Ireland and Pickering, of Grove and Berry, of Sidney, Cornish  and Alice Lisle, turns to the trials of Preston and Ashton, will be  astonished by the contrast. The Solicitor General, Somers, conducted the  prosecutions with a moderation and humanity of which his predecessors  had left him no example. \"I did never think,\" he said, \"that it was the  part of any who were of counsel for the King in cases of this nature  to aggravate the crime of the prisoners, or to put false colours on the  evidence.\" [10] Holt's conduct was faultless. Pollexfen, an older man  than Holt or Somers, retained a little,--and a little was too much,--of  the tone of that bad school in which he had been bred. But, though he  once or twice forgot the austere decorum of his place, he cannot  be accused of any violation of substantial justice. The prisoners  themselves seem to have been surprised by the fairness and gentleness  with which they were treated. \"I would not mislead the jury, I'll assure  you,\" said Holt to Preston, \"nor do Your Lordship any manner of injury  in the world.\" \"No, my Lord;\" said Preston; \"I see it well enough that  Your Lordship would not.\" \"Whatever my fate may be,\" said Ashton, \"I  cannot but own that I have had a fair trial for my life.\"    The culprits gained nothing by the moderation of the Solicitor General  or by the impartiality of the Court; for the evidence was irresistible.  The meaning of the papers seized by Billop was so plain that the dullest  juryman could not misunderstand it. Of those papers part was fully  proved to be in Preston's handwriting. Part was in Ashton's handwriting  but this the counsel for the prosecution had not the means of proving.  They therefore rested the case against Ashton on the indisputable facts  that the treasonable packet had been found in his bosom, and that he had  used language which was quite unintelligible except on the supposition  that he had a guilty knowledge of the contents. [11]    Both Preston and Ashton were convicted and sentenced to death.  Ashton was speedily executed. He might have saved his life by making  disclosures. But though he declared that, if he were spared, he would  always be a faithful subject of Their Majesties, he was fully resolved  not to give up the names of his accomplices. In this resolution he was  encouraged by the nonjuring divines who attended him in his cell. It  was probably by their influence that he was induced to deliver to the  Sheriffs on the scaffold a declaration which he had transcribed  and signed, but had not, it is to be hoped, composed or attentively  considered. In this paper he was made to complain of the unfairness of a  trial which he had himself in public acknowledged to have been eminently  fair. He was also made to aver, on the word of a dying man, that he knew  nothing of the papers which had been found upon him. Unfortunately his  declaration, when inspected, proved to be in the same handwriting with  one of the most important of those papers. He died with manly fortitude.  [12]    Elliot was not brought to trial. The evidence against him was not quite  so clear as that on which his associates had been convicted; and he was  not worth the anger of the government. The fate of Preston was long in  suspense. The Jacobites affected to be confident that the government  would not dare to shed his blood. He was, they said, a favourite at  Versailles, and his death would be followed by a terrible retaliation.  They scattered about the streets of London papers in which it was  asserted that, if any harm befell him, Mountjoy, and all the other  Englishmen of quality who were prisoners in France, would be broken  on the wheel. [13] These absurd threats would not have deferred the  execution one day. But those who had Preston in their power were not  unwilling to spare him on certain conditions. He was privy to all the  counsels of the disaffected party, and could furnish information of the  highest value. He was informed that his fate depended on himself. The  struggle was long and severe. Pride, conscience, party spirit, were on  one side; the intense love of life on the other. He went during a time  irresolutely to and fro. He listened to his brother Jacobites; and his  courage rose. He listened to the agents of the government; and his heart  sank within him. In an evening when he had dined and drunk his claret,  he feared nothing. He would die like a man, rather than save his neck by  an act of baseness. But his temper was very different when he woke the  next morning, when the courage which he had drawn from wine and company  had evaporated, when he was alone with the iron grates and stone walls,  and when the thought of the block, the axe and the sawdust rose in his  mind. During some time he regularly wrote a confession every forenoon  when he was sober, and burned it every night when he was merry. [14]  His nonjuring friends formed a plan for bringing Sancroft to visit  the Tower, in the hope, doubtless, that the exhortations of so great a  prelate and so great a saint would confirm the wavering virtue of the  prisoner. [15] Whether this plan would have been successful may be  doubted; it was not carried into effect; the fatal hour drew near; and  the fortitude of Preston gave way. He confessed his guilt, and named  Clarendon, Dartmouth, the Bishop of Ely and William Penn, as his  accomplices. He added a long list of persons against whom he could not  himself give evidence, but who, if he could trust to Penn's assurances,  were friendly to King James. Among these persons were Devonshire and  Dorset. [16] There is not the slightest reason to believe that either  of these great noblemen ever had any dealings, direct or indirect,  with Saint Germains. It is not, however, necessary to accuse Penn of  deliberate falsehood. He was credulous and garrulous. The Lord Steward  and the Lord Chamberlain had shared in the vexation with which their  party had observed the leaning of William towards the Tories; and they  had probably expressed that vexation unguardedly. So weak a man as Penn,  wishing to find Jacobites every where, and prone to believe whatever he  wished, might easily put an erroneous construction on invectives such as  the haughty and irritable Devonshire was but too ready to utter, and on  sarcasms such as, in moments of spleen, dropped but too easily from the  lips of the keenwitted Dorset. Caermarthen, a Tory, and a Tory who had  been mercilessly persecuted by the Whigs, was disposed to make the most  of this idle hearsay. But he received no encouragement from his master,  who, of all the great politicians mentioned in history, was the least  prone to suspicion. When William returned to England, Preston was  brought before him, and was commanded to repeat the confession which  had already been made to the ministers. The King stood behind the Lord  President's chair and listened gravely while Clarendon, Dartmouth,  Turner and Penn were named. But as soon as the prisoner, passing from  what he could himself testify, began to repeat the stories which Penn  had told him, William touched Caermarthen on the shoulder and said, \"My  Lord, we have had too much of this.\" [17] This judicious magnanimity  had its proper reward. Devonshire and Dorset became from that day more  zealous than ever in the cause of the master who, in spite of calumny  for which their own indiscretion had perhaps furnished some ground, had  continued to repose confidence in their loyalty. [18]    Even those who were undoubtedly criminal were generally treated with  great lenity. Clarendon lay in the Tower about six months. His guilt  was fully established; and a party among the Whigs called loudly and  importunately for his head. But he was saved by the pathetic entreaties  of his brother Rochester, by the good offices of the humane and  generous Burnet, and by Mary's respect for the memory of her mother. The  prisoner's confinement was not strict. He was allowed to entertain  his friends at dinner. When at length his health began to suffer from  restraint, he was permitted to go into the country under the care of a  warder; the warder was soon removed; and Clarendon was informed that,  while he led a quiet rural life, he should not be molested. [19]    The treason of Dartmouth was of no common dye. He was an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#5)"],[1," and runs along the entire front of the building; the bed-rooms are the  large airy rooms above. Behind the house is a paved yard for exercise.  Chatterton remained here about seven years.    [5] The gate seen at the side of Colston's School in our cut, is that by  which the school is entered; a narrow paved passage beside the house  conducts to the angle of the building, when you turn to the left, and so  reach the house by an open court-yard. In the corner of this angle,  commanding a view of the entrance to the school, and also of the outer  gate, is placed the doorkeeper's lodge delineated in our cut. It is a  small building of brick, covered with lead, about six feet in height. It  has within an iron seat, and an iron ledge for books. The windows are  unglazed; and in winter it must be singularly uncomfortable,  particularly as the occupant must traverse the length of the yard in all  weathers. It is said to be the intention of the authorities to remove  this little building; this is to be regretted, as it is almost the only  unchanged memorial of her poet-boy which Bristol possesses. It was  customary for the boys to take the office of doorkeeper in rotation for  the term of one week; and it was in Chatterton's twelfth year, when he  was doorkeeper, that he wrote here his first poem \"On the Last Epiphany,  or Christ coming to Judgment.\"    [6] Lambert's first office was on St. John's Steps; but the unceasing  spirit of change, which has more or less destroyed all the Bristol  localities connected with Chatterton, has swept this one away; \"the  Steps\" have now been turned into a sloping ascent, and the old houses  removed or renovated. Shortly after he had entered Lambert's service,  his office was removed to Corn Street, and here, from the house  delineated in our cut, he dated his first communication to Horace  Walpole. It is immediately in front of the Exchange, and although the  lower part has been altered frequently within remembrance, the upper  part remains as when Lambert rented it. It may be noted, that the upper  floors of the adjacent houses are still devoted to lawyers' and  merchants' offices.    [7] The great Bristol merchant, William Canynge, jun., is buried in  Redcliffe Church, to which he was a great benefactor, as he was to the  city of Bristol generally. He entered the church to avoid a second  marriage, and was made Dean of the College of Westbury, which he had  rebuilt. There are two monuments to his memory in Redcliffe Church, both  of which are seen in our engraving. One is a raised altar tomb with an  enriched canopy; and upon the tomb lie the effigies of Canynge and his  wife in the costume of the fifteenth century. The other tomb is of  similar construction, and is believed to have been brought here from  Westbury College; it represents Canynge in his clerical robes, his head  supported by angels, and resting his feet on the figure of a Saracen.  Here Chatterton frequently ruminated; indeed, the whole church abounds  with memorials which call to mind the sources of his inspiration; near  the door is an effigy inscribed \"Johannes Lamyngton,\" which gave name to  one of his forgeries. He was never weary of rambling in and about the  church, and all his early works originated here.    [8] The muniment-room is a large low-roofed apartment over the beautiful  north porch of Redcliffe Church, which was constructed by Canynge. It is  hexagonal, and lighted by narrow unglazed windows. The floor rests on  the groined stones of the porch, strong beams of oak forming its roof.  It is secured by two massive doors in the narrow passage leading from  the stairs into it. Here were preserved several large chests, and among  them _Canynge's cofre_; from which Chatterton assured the world he had  obtained the Rowley MSS.; and from which MSS. were carried away and  destroyed, but the old chests still remain. There are seven in all, and  they bear traces of great antiquity. Many have been strongly bound with  iron, but all are now in a state of decay. This lonely cheerless room,  strewn with antique fragments and suggestive of the boy-poet's  day-dreams, is certainly the most interesting relic in Bristol. Its  comfortless neglect is a true epitome of the life of him who first  shaped his course from his reveries within it.    [9] The house said to be that of Canynge is situated in Redcliffe  Street, not very far from the church. It is now occupied by a  bookseller, who uses the fine hall seen in our cut, as a storehouse for  his volumes. Chatterton frequently mentions this \"house nempte the rodde  lodge;\" and in Skelton's \"Etchings of Bristol Antiquities\" is an  engraving of this building, there called \"Canynge's chapel or Masonic  Hall,\" showing the painting in the arch at the back, representing the  first person of the Trinity, supporting the crucified Saviour, angels at  each side censing, and others bearing shields. This was \"the Rood\" with  which Chatterton was familiar, and which induced him to give the name to  Canynge's house in his fabrications. This painting is now destroyed, but  we have restored it from Skelton's plate in our engraving.    [10] The monk Rowley was altogether an imaginary person conjured up by  Chatterton as a vehicle for his wonderful forgeries. He was described by  him as the intimate friend of Canynge, his constant companion, and a  collector of books and drawings for him. It has been well remarked, that  although it was _extraordinary_ for a lad to have written them in the  18th century, it was _impossible_ for a monk to have written them in the  15th. Indeed, it seems now both curious and amusing that his forgeries  should have deceived the learned. When Rowley talks of purchasing his  house \"on a repayring lease for ninety-nine years.\" We at once smile,  and remember his fellow-forger Ireland's Shaksperian _Promissory_ note,  before such things were invented. Our fac-simile of the pretended  Rowley's writing is obtained from the very curious collection of  Chatterton's manuscripts in the British Museum. It is written at the  bottom of some drawings of monumental slabs and notes, stated to have  been \"collected ande gotten for Mr. William Canynge, by mee, Thomas  Rowley.\" There are, however, other autographs of Rowley in the  collection, so entirely dissimilar in the formation of the letters, that  it might be expected to have induced a conviction of forgery. Many of  the manuscripts too are still more dissimilar; and the construction of  the letters totally unlike any of the period. Some are written on little  fragments not more than three inches square, the writing sometimes neat  and clean, at other times bad, rambling and unintelligible. The best is  the account of Canynge's feast, which has been engraved in fac-simile by  Strutt, to the edition of Rowley's Poems, 1777. The writing is generally  bolder than Barrett's fac-simile; and that gentleman, in endeavoring to  revive the faded ink, has greatly injured the originals, which are now  in some cases almost indistinguishable. The drawings of pretended  ancient coins and heraldry are absurdly inventive: and the  representations of buildings exactly such as a boy without knowledge of  drawing or architecture would fabricate; yet they imposed on Barrett who  engraved them for his history of Bristol. Many of his transcripts show  the shifts the poor boy was put to for paper; torn fragments and backs  of law bills are frequently employed. Among the rest is a collection of  extracts from Chaucer to aid him in the fabrication of his MSS. The  whole is exceedingly instructive and curious.    [11] This gentleman was the proprietor of the \"Bristol Journal,\" to  which Chatterton sent his first forgery; and with whom he afterwards  became intimate.    [12] The cenotaph erected to Chatterton, in 1838, from a design by S. C.  Fripp, has now been removed; it stood close to the north porch, beside  the steps leading into it. One of the inscriptions, which he directs in  his will to be placed on his tomb, has been adopted. \"To the Memory of  Thomas Chatterton. Reader, judge not, if thou art a Christian. Believe  that he shall be judged by a superior Power. To that Power alone is he  now answerable.\"          Authors and Books.      Of personalities, &c. a few words: Every man or woman coming before the  public voluntarily--especially every man or woman placing his or her  name upon the title of a book--submits so much of his or her being and  character to the general criticism. It is crime to make public use of  private conversation; it is crime, under most circumstances, to disclose  the secret of an anonymous authorship; it is crime in all cases to  invade any privacy, or comment on any purely personal matter, that has  not by the interested party been offered for the world's examination. If  any one publish a work of pure art, it is entirely inexcusable to  suggest any illustrations of it from his life or condition, unless by  his own express or implied permission. For example, if \"The Princess,\"  by Tennyson, had been printed anonymously by some notorious thief,  burglar, forger, or murderer, he would be as great a villain as the  author, who, in reviewing the poem, should in any manner whatever allude  to the author's sins. The extent to which this law may be applied can  easily be understood. To a gentleman the law itself is an instinct.  Personal rights are frequently violated by praise as well as by censure,  and sometimes applause is not in any degree less offensive than  denunciation, though commonly men will forgive even the most unskilful  and injudicious commendation. In both ways the writers of this country  are apt to err.    While we agree with the most fastidious, in asserting that inviolability  of one's individualism, not by himself submitted for public observation,  we contend for the right and duty of the utmost freedom in the  dissection of what is thus submitted.
