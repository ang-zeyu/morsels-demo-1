None but I, Phoebus Apollo, may  drive the flaming chariot of the sun, for the way is beset with  dangers and none know it but I.\"    \"Only tell me the way, my father!\" cried Phaeton. \"So soon I could  learn.\"    Half in sadness, Apollo smiled.    \"The first part of the way is uphill,\" he said. \"So steep it is that  only very slowly can my horses climb it. High in the heavens is the  middle, so high that even I grow dizzy when I look down upon the earth  and the sea. And the last piece of the way is a precipice that rushes  so steeply downward that my hands can scarce check the mad rush of my  galloping horses. And all the while, the heaven is spinning round, and  the stars with it. By the horns of the Bull I have to drive, past the  Archer whose bow is taut and ready to slay, close to where the  Scorpion stretches out its arms and the great Crab's claws grope for a  prey....\"    \"I fear none of these things, oh my father!\" cried Phaeton. \"Grant  that for one day only I drive thy white-maned steeds!\"    Very pitifully Apollo looked at him, and for a little space he was  silent.    \"The little human hands,\" he said at length, \"the little human  frame!--and with them the soul of a god. The pity of it, my son. Dost  not know that the boon that thou dost crave from me is Death?\"    \"Rather Death than Dishonour,\" said Phaeton, and proudly he added,  \"For once would I drive like the god, my father. I have no fear.\"    So was Apollo vanquished, and Phaeton gained his heart's desire.    From the courtyard of the Palace the four white horses were led, and  they pawed the air and neighed aloud in the glory of their strength.  They drew the chariot whose axle and pole and wheels were of gold,  with spokes of silver, while inside were rows of diamonds and of  chrysolites that gave dazzling reflection of the sun. Then Apollo  anointed the face of Phaeton with a powerful essence that might keep  him from being smitten by the flames, and upon his head he placed the  rays of the sun. And then the stars went away, even to the Daystar  that went last of all, and, at Apollo's signal, Aurora, the  rosy-fingered, threw open the purple gates of the east, and Phaeton  saw a path of pale rose-colour open before him.    With a cry of exultation, the boy leapt into the chariot and laid hold  of the golden reins. Barely did he hear Apollo's parting words: \"Hold  fast the reins, and spare the whip. All thy strength will be wanted to  hold the horses in. Go not too high nor too low. The middle course is  safest and best. Follow, if thou canst, in the old tracks of my  chariot wheels!\" His glad voice of thanks for the godlike boon rang  back to where Apollo stood and watched him vanishing into the dawn  that still was soft in hue as the feathers on the breast of a dove.    Uphill at first the white steeds made their way, and the fire from  their nostrils tinged with flame-colour the dark clouds that hung over  the land and the sea. With rapture, Phaeton felt that truly he was the  son of a god, and that at length he was enjoying his heritage. The day  for which, through all his short life, he had longed, had come at  last. He was driving the chariot whose progress even now was awaking  the sleeping earth. The radiance from its wheels and from the rays he  wore round his head was painting the clouds, and he laughed aloud in  rapture as he saw, far down below, the sea and the rivers he had  bathed in as a human boy, mirroring the green and rose and purple, and  gold and silver, and fierce crimson, that he, Phaeton, was placing in  the sky. The grey mist rolled from the mountain tops at his desire.  The white fog rolled up from the valleys. All living things awoke; the  flowers opened their petals; the grain grew golden; the fruit grew  ripe. Could but Epaphos see him now! Surely he must see him, and  realise that not Apollo but Phaeton was guiding the horses of his  father, driving the chariot of the Sun.    Quicker and yet more quick grew the pace of the white-maned steeds.  Soon they left the morning breezes behind, and very soon they knew  that these were not the hands of the god, their master, that held the  golden reins. Like an air-ship without its accustomed ballast, the  chariot rolled unsteadily, and not only the boy's light weight but his  light hold on their bridles made them grow mad with a lust for speed.  The white foam flew from their mouths like the spume from the giant  waves of a furious sea, and their pace was swift as that of a bolt  that is cast by the arm of Zeus.    Yet Phaeton had no fear, and when they heard him shout in rapture,  \"Quicker still, brave ones! more swiftly still!\" it made them speed  onwards, madly, blindly, with the headlong rush of a storm. There was  no hope for them to keep on the beaten track, and soon Phaeton had his  rapture checked by the terrible realisation that they had strayed far  out of the course and that his hands were not strong enough to guide  them. Close to the Great Bear and the Little Bear they passed, and  these were scorched with heat. The Serpent which, torpid, chilly and  harmless, lies coiled round the North Pole, felt a warmth that made it  grow fierce and harmful again. Downward, ever downward galloped the  maddened horses, and soon Phaeton saw the sea as a shield of molten  brass, and the earth so near that all things on it were visible. When  they passed the Scorpion and only just missed destruction from its  menacing fangs, fear entered into the boy's heart. His mother had  spoken truth. He was only partly a god, and he was very, very young.  In impotent horror he tugged at the reins to try to check the horses'  descent, then, forgetful of Apollo's warning, he smote them angrily.  But anger met anger, and the fury of the immortal steeds had scorn  for the wrath of a mortal boy. With a great toss of their mighty heads  they had torn the guiding reins from his grasp, and as he stood,  giddily swaying from side to side, Phaeton knew that the boon he had  craved from his father must in truth be death for him.    And, lo, it was a hideous death, for with eyes that were like flames  that burned his brain, the boy beheld the terrible havoc that his  pride had wrought. That blazing chariot of the Sun made the clouds  smoke, and dried up all the rivers and water-springs. Fire burst from  the mountain tops, great cities were destroyed. The beauty of the  earth was ravished, woods and meadows and all green and pleasant  places were laid waste. The harvests perished, the flocks and they who  had herded them lay dead. Over Libya the horses took him, and the  desert of Libya remains a barren wilderness to this day, while those  sturdy Ethiopians who survived are black even now as a consequence of  that cruel heat. The Nile changed its course in order to escape, and  nymphs and nereids in terror sought for the sanctuary of some watery  place that had escaped destruction. The face of the burned and  blackened earth, where the bodies of thousands of human beings lay  charred to ashes, cracked and sent dismay to Pluto by the lurid light  that penetrated even to his throne.    All this Phaeton saw, saw in impotent agony of soul. His boyish folly  and pride had been great, but the excruciating anguish that made him  shed tears of blood, was indeed a punishment even too heavy for an  erring god.    From the havoc around her, the Earth at last looked up, and with  blackened face and blinded eyes, and in a voice that was harsh and  very, very weary, she called to Zeus to look down from Olympus and  behold the ruin that had been wrought by the chariot of the Sun. And  Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, looked down and beheld. And at the sight of  that piteous devastation his brow grew dark, and terrible was his  wrath against him who had held the reins of the chariot. Calling upon  Apollo and all the other gods to witness him, he seized a lightning  bolt, and for a moment the deathless Zeus and all the dwellers in  Olympus looked on the fiery chariot in which stood the swaying,  slight, lithe figure of a young lad, blinded with horror, shaken with  agony. Then, from his hand, Zeus cast the bolt, and the chariot was  dashed into fragments, and Phaeton, his golden hair ablaze, fell, like  a bright shooting star, from the heavens above, into the river  Eridanus. The steeds returned to their master, Apollo, and in rage and  grief Apollo lashed them. Angrily, too, and very rebelliously did he  speak of the punishment meted to his son by the ruler of the  Immortals. Yet in truth the punishment was a merciful one. Phaeton was  only half a god, and no human life were fit to live after the day of  dire anguish that had been his.    Bitter was the mourning of Clymene over her beautiful only son, and so  ceaselessly did his three sisters, the Heliades, weep for their  brother, that the gods turned them into poplar trees that grew by the  bank of the river, and, when still they wept, their tears turned into  precious amber as they fell. Yet another mourned for Phaeton--Phaeton  \"dead ere his prime.\" Cycnus, King of Liguria, had dearly loved the  gallant boy, and again and yet again he dived deep in the river and  brought forth the charred fragments of what had once been the  beautiful son of a god, and gave to them honourable burial. Yet he  could not rest satisfied that he had won all that remained of his  friend from the river's bed, and so he continued to haunt the stream,  ever diving, ever searching, until the gods grew weary of his restless  sorrow and changed him into a swan.    And still we see the swan sailing mournfully along, like a  white-sailed barque that is bearing the body of a king "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22694"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 2, January, 1851 (#5)"],[1,"renders life happy, and suffered what sanctifies and prepares us for a  better world, exists no longer; but his name is incorporated with our  history, and adds another to the list of the great men who have been  called into life and received their first and best impressions in  Ireland; and if Ireland had given nothing to her more prosperous sister  than the extraordinary men of the past and present century, she merits  her gratitude for the gifts which bestow so much honor and glory on the  United Kingdoms.    Mrs. Burke, previous to her death, sold the mansion to her neighbor, Mr.  John Du Pre, of Wilton Park. Mrs. Haviland, Mr. Burke's niece, lived  with her to the last, though she did not receive the portion of her  fortune to which she was considered entitled. Her son, Thomas Haviland  Burke, grand-nephew of Edmund, became the lineal representative of the  family; but the library, and all the tokens of respect and admiration  which he received from the good, and from the whole world, went with the  property to _Mrs. Burke's_ nephew, Mr. Nugent. Some of the sculpture  which ornamented the house now graces the British Museum.    The mansion was burnt on the 23d of April, 1813. The ground where it  stood is unequal; and some of the park wall remains, and fine old trees  still flourish, beneath whose shade we picture the meeting between the  mourning father and the favorite horse of his lost son.    There is a full-length portrait of Edmund Burke in the Examination Hall  of the Dublin University. All such portraits should be copied, and  preserved in our own Houses of Parliament, a meet honor to the dead, and  a stimulant to the living to \"go and do likewise.\" It hardly realizes,  however, the _ideal_ of Burke; perhaps no portrait could. What Miss  Edgeworth called the \"ground-plan of the face\" is there; but we must  imagine the varying expression, the light of the bright quick eyes, the  eloquence of the unclosed lips, the storm which could gather  thunder-clouds on the well-formed brow; but we have far exceeded our  limits without exhausting our subject, and, with Dr. Parr, still would  speak of Burke:    \"Of Burke, by whose sweetness Athens herself would have been soothed,  with whose amplitude and exuberance she would have been enraptured and  on whose lips that prolific mother of genius and science would have  adored, confessed--the Goddess of Persuasion.\"    Alas! we have lingered long at his shrine, and yet our praise is not  half spoken.    --[The notes and drawings for this paper were contributed by F. W.  Fairhold, of the Society of Antiquaries.]    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Sylvanus Spenser, the eldest son of the Poet Spenser, married Ellen  Nagle, eldest daughter of David Nagle, Esq., ancestor of the lady, who  was mother to Edmund Burke.    [2] This as a picture is outlined with so delicate a pencil, and colored  with such mingled purity and richness of tone, that we transcribe a few  passages, as much in honor of the man who could write, as the woman who  could inspire such praise:--    \"The character of ----    \"She is handsome, but it is beauty not arising from features, from  complexion, or from shape. She has all three in a high degree, but it is  not by these she touches a heart; it is all that sweetness of temper,  benevolence, innocence, and sensibility, which a face can express, that  forms her beauty. She has a face that just raises your attention at  first sight; it grows on you every moment, and you wonder it did no more  than raise your attention at first.    \"Her eyes have a mild light, but they awe when she pleases; they command  like a good man out of office, not by authority, but by virtue.    \"Her stature is not tall, she is not made to be the admiration of every  body, but the happiness of one.    \"She has all the firmness that does not exclude delicacy--she has all  the softness that does not imply weakness. * *    \"Her voice is a soft, low, music, not formed to rule in public  assemblies, but to charm those who can distinguish a company from a  crowd: it has this advantage--_you must come close to her to hear it_.    \"To describe her body, describes her mind; one is the transcript of the  other; her understanding is not shown in the variety of matters it  exerts itself on, but in the goodness of the choice she makes.    \"She does not display it so much in saying or doing striking things, as  in avoiding such as she ought _not_ to say or do.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"No persons of so few years can know the world better; no person was  ever less corrupted by the knowledge.    \"Her politeness flows rather from a natural disposition to oblige, than  from any rules on that subject, and therefore never fails to strike  those who understand good breeding, and those who do not.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"She has a steady and firm mind, _which takes no more from the solidity  of the female character, than the solidity of marble does from its  polish and lustre_. She has such virtues as make us value the truly  great of our own sex. She has all the winning graces that make us love  even the faults we see in the weak and beautiful in hers.\"    [3] Our cut exhibits all that now remains of Gregories--a few walls and  a portion of the old stables. Mrs. Burke, before her death, sold the  mansion to her neighbor, Mr. John Du Pre, of Wilton Park. It was  destroyed by fire soon afterwards.    [4] During Barry's five years' residence abroad he earned nothing for  himself, and received no supplies save from Edmund and Richard Burke.    [5] Mr. Prior says in his admirable Life of Burke--\"How the money to  effect this purchase was procured has given rise to many surmises and  reports; a considerable portion was his own, the bequest of his father  and elder brother. The Marquis of Rockingham offered the loan of the  amount required to complete the purchase; the Marquis was under  obligations to him publicly, and privately for some attention paid to  the business of his large estates in Ireland. Less disinterested men  would have settled the matter otherwise--the one by quartering his  friend, the other, by being quartered, on the public purse. To the honor  of both, a different course was pursued.\"    [6] Waller was a resident in this vicinity, in which his landed property  chiefly lay. He lived in the family mansion named Well's Court, a  property still in the possession of his descendants. His tomb is a table  monument of white marble, upon which rises a pyramid, resting on skulls  with bat's wings; it is a peculiar but picturesque addition to the  churchyard, and, from its situation close to the walk, attracts much  attention.    [7] Our engraving exhibits his simple tablet, as seen from the central  aisle of the church, immediately in front of the pew in which Burke and  his family always sat.          POEMS BY S. G. GOODRICH[8]      For the last twenty years the name of Mr. Goodrich has been very  constantly associated with American literature. He commenced as a  publisher, in Boston, and was among the first to encourage by liberal  copyrights, and to make attractive by elegant editions, the works of  American authors. One of his earliest undertakings was a collection of  the novels of Charles Brockden Brown, with a memoir of that author, by  his widow, with whom he shared the profits. In 1828 he began \"The  Token,\" an annual literary souvenir, which he edited and published  fourteen years. In this appeared the first fruits of the genius of  Cheney, who has long been acknowledged the master of American engravers;  and the first poems and prose writings of Longfellow, Willis, Mellen,  Mrs. Osgood, Mrs. Child, Mrs. Sigourney, and other eminent authors. In  \"The Token\" also were printed his own earlier lyrical pieces. The work  was of the first rank in its class, and in England as well as in this  country it was uniformly praised.    In 1831 an anonymous romance was published by Marsh & Capen, of Boston.  It was attributed by some to Willis, and by others to Mrs. Child, then  Miss Francis. It illustrated a fine and peculiar genius, but was soon  forgotten. Mr. Goodrich appreciated its merits, and applied to the  publishers for the name of the author, that he might engage him as a  contributor to \"The Token.\" They declined to disclose his secret, but  offered to forward a letter to him. Mr. Goodrich wrote one, and received  an answer signed by NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, many of whose best productions,  as \"Sights from a Steeple,\" \"Sketches under an Umbrella,\" \"The Prophetic  Pictures,\" \"Canterbury Pilgrims,\" &c., appeared in this annual. In 1839,  Mr. Goodrich suggested to Mr. Hawthorne the publication of a collection  of his tales, surrendering his copyrights to several of them for this  purpose; but so little were the extraordinary qualities of this  admirable author then understood, that the publishers would not venture  upon such an experiment without an assurance against loss, which Mr.  Goodrich, as his friend, therefore gave. The public judgment will be  entitled to little respect, if the copyright of the works of Hawthorne  be not hereafter a most ample fortune.    Mr. Goodrich soon abandoned the business of publishing, and, though  still editing \"The Token,\" devoted his attention chiefly to the writing  of that series of educational works, known as _Peter Parley's_, which  has spread his fame over the world. The whole number of these volumes is  about sixty. Among them are treatises upon a great variety of subjects,  and they are remarkable for simplicity of style and felicity of  illustration. Mr. Goodrich has accomplished a complete and important  revolution in juvenile reading, substituting truth and nature for  grotesque fiction in the materials and processes of instruction, and  his method has been largely imitated, at home and abroad. In England  many authors and publishers have disgraced the literary profession by  works under the name of \"Parley"]]]
