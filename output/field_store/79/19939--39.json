But that is only guessing; the line on the maps  tempts it.    East of Gomshall to Oxted almost on the county border the track of the  old Way and of the Pilgrims' Ways, sometimes coinciding, sometimes  running parallel to each other, runs along the crest and the southern  slopes of the chalk ridge. Yews and wind-bent thorn mark the ways,  sometimes, as east of Gomshall, by a clear cut ridge in the hill, lined  with ancient trees; sometimes, as under Denbies by Dorking, you can only  pick out the path by solitary yews studding grass fields and corn-land.  At the gap of the Mole by Dorking the old Way, perhaps, forded the Mole;  the pilgrims would cross by Burford Bridge, which joins the Roman Ermyn  Street to Stane Street beyond Dorking. Both the Way and the pilgrims'  track would join on the line of yews on Box Hill, and from Box Hill to  Reigate there is a succession of yew road-marks and hedges, with here  and there the whole face of the downs bitten out by a chalk pit;  gradually the road climbs, until the track above Reigate lies almost on  the highest point of the ridge. At Reigate the old Way carries on,  crossing the hill-road which was from the town north to London. The  slope of the modern road has been eased by cutting into the hill, and  the ancient Way now is joined, on Reigate Hill, by a suspension bridge.    But the pilgrims would drop down into the town to sleep and to eat and  drink. You may see their tracks on the chalk, streaming down from the  ridge like a bunch of white ribands in the wind. They came into Reigate  by Slipshoe Lane, and there, where the cross roads meet, they stood to  pray at St. Thomas's shrine, now no more.    [Illustration: _By Slipshoe Lane to the Red Cross Inn, Reigate._]    They would please themselves where they climbed the ridge again. Or they  joined the old Way, perhaps, in what is now Gatton Park, where the yews  point to Merstham church. After Merstham the tracks divide again. East  of an interrupting chalk pit, a thick yew hedge lines the side of the  hill, under which I once ate fine blackberries in December, as perhaps  the Wife of Bath ate them. But half way along the ridge of yews another  path climbs up a plough, and on the crest it joins a narrow lane which  is as much the Pilgrims' Way as any road on the downs; it runs by  Tollsworth Farm over the summit of White Hill, and is actually marked  \"The Pilgrims' Way\" twice on the sign posts, so sure are the local  painters of what they have to point out. East from White Hill you may  follow a single track, sometimes grass, sometimes modern road. There is  a puzzle at Godstone Quarry, where the chalk pits have cut the hill to  pieces, and the tiny path which perhaps still keeps the line across the  pits is a perilous slippery place in the rain. On the far side of  to-day's road by the chalk pit you may pick up the green track again,  though you will lose it rounding the spur of the hill that lies half way  between Godstone and the railway. The old Way probably still kept to the  ridge, and Sir Gilbert Scott thought he had traced the Pilgrims' Way  through the Hanging Wood north of Tandridge Hill Lane. But I think I  found it in a green track which runs westward from a gap in that same  lane. It looked like a rough cart-track through a field, and would join  the road already traced beyond. In its centre, a foot from the ground,  was placed, and doubtless remains, a blue enamelled notice board, with  the brief but usual caution to trespassers.    East of Tandridge Hill Lane, on the far side of a grass field, a curious  path, half ditch, half avenue of yews and thorns, leads down through  woodland to green trackway again. The green track crosses the railway  cutting, and so journeys on into Titsey Park on the level lowland. Under  the new Titsey church it runs, as it once ran past the old church in the  Park, and from Titsey church eastward, by a country lane through broad  and glorious cornfields, it passes out of Surrey into Kent.    By those ways they went, fur-clad Briton, ravaging Dane, Roman eagle,  traders of tin and drivers of ponies, along the ridge in the sun and the  wind and the rain; by their side and after them, along the ridge and  under it, travelled the knight and the clerk and the friar and the  summoner, as they travelled from the Tabard Inn to St. Thomas's shrine  with Chaucer; and we may follow them, beginning with Surrey's western  town, and journeying at the end from the Tabard again, with the pilgrims  passing to the east.          CHAPTER II    FARNHAM        The joining of the ways.--Georgian poke bonnets.--The Castle.--Kings      at Farnham.--Poet Soldiers.--A glorious battle.--The Bishop's      artillery.--Paradise and the Bull's Eye.--Izaak Walton.--Cobbett's      education.--An old alehouse.--Hopgrowers in difficulties.--King      Charles's cap.--Elmer's pheasants.      Westernmost of all Surrey towns, Farnham stands at the joining of the  ways. Traders from Cornwall, pilgrims from Winchester, horse-dealers  driving their ponies from Weyhill Fair, have met on the roads that run  into Farnham from the west and south and north. Farnham Castle, for  seven centuries a Bishop's palace, links Surrey to the See of  Winchester. The Farnham oasthouses and hop-grounds bridge the crossing  from the fertile Hampshire border to the Bagshot sands and the wild and  sterile moors of Frensham and Hindhead. The town, set in its cultured  plot of vines and flower-beds, with its historic castle, its tranquil  church, and the Wey watering the pastures under its walls, stands like a  garden between the military rigidity of Aldershot and the wind that  blows over the Thursley heather.    No town in Surrey has two such old and orderly main streets as Farnham.  Here and there modern taste for a noisy pattern has broken the quiet  level; a bank has piled up a huge building of timber, handsome but out  of keeping; the new Corn Exchange is out of keeping and hideous; and in  1866 municipal enterprise pulled down the old market house, which stood  at the junction of the main streets and was a fascinating little  building perched on pillars. But much that is ancient and simple in  square red brick remains. The plain, low-roofed houses, with their flat  facades and crumpled, lichened tiles, succeed one another down Castle  Street and West Street with a delightful monotony. The elaborate carved  and painted doorways, knockers, lunettes, doors and steps are quite a  model exhibition. The two streets wear a Georgian air of poke-bonnets  and long purse-strings. Or they are Georgian, at all events, once or  twice during the day; on a sunny morning before breakfast, perhaps, or  when, perhaps in the rain, the endless traffic of wheels quiets for an  hour. For Farnham stands on the high road from London, and the motor  cars chase the eighteenth century into the side-streets.    [Illustration: _Looking towards Farnham from Thursley Common._]    Farnham is mostly of one period, and searchers for very old architecture  will be disappointed. One of the oldest buildings in the town is a tiny  set of almshouses, whose lowly gables line the road under the castle  hill. They were built by Andrew Windsor, of the parish of Bentley in  Hampshire, in 1619, and were intended, as an inscription on the wall  informs you, \"For the Habitation and Relief of eight poor Honest  Impotent Old Persons.\" Even with four epithets, the almoners seem to  find life supportable.    The greatest and the oldest building is, of course, the castle. It  stands nobly on a hill, towards which the street rises like a carriage  drive, ending in a flight of steps. Once it must have dominated the town  as a fortress, but since Cromwell broke down the keep, Farnham has  looked up at a quieter and more episcopal pile--a fine gateway tower,  built by Bishop Fox early in the sixteenth century. Much of the castle  stands as he rebuilt it after various misfortunes in baronial and other  wars, but the front as it looks down on Farnham is less severe. Two  imposing cedar trees, out of a group of several, break the line of Fox's  massive red brick. Local legend has aged them considerably, for two  hundred years is suggested as a modest estimate of their antiquity. As a  fact, they cannot be much more than one hundred years old. They were  planted by Mrs. North, wife of Bishop North, who held the See from 1781  to 1820, and in an engraving of the castle published in 1792 there is  not a sign of them. The cedar is a very fast-growing tree--one of the  reasons why it is so brittle. The Farnham cedars are as brittle as any  others. I was told that when the present Bishop went abroad early in the  year 1908, he was hesitating over cutting off some of the larger  branches which shaded the castle wall and would not let it dry. The  April snow settled the question for him, and broke the branches he had  thought of lopping.    Farnham Castle has entertained many Kings, from Edward I to Queen  Victoria. One of its earliest bishops was a king's brother, the great  Henry of Blois. Elizabeth was often at the castle, and once, bidding the  Duke of Norfolk dine with her there, spoke to him of his intrigue to  marry Mary Queen of Scots. According to one story she warned him \"to be  careful on what pillow he laid his head\"; according to another, the Duke  assured the Queen that the intrigue was none of his making, and that \"he  meant never to marry with such a person where he could not be sure of  his pillow.\" He was thinking of Darnley, and that dark February morning  with the King stretched dead on the garden grass.    James I hunted at Farnham regularly, and actually took a lease from  Bishop Bilson of the castle, which he found a convenient centre for  hunting in the Surrey bailiwick of Windsor Forest. But"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28066"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, February, 1880 (#5)"],[1," its first occurrences, by a chronometer which did not come into use  until the fourth day? The notion that these days were twenty-four hours,  sprang up in the middle ages, and is the child of the literalism and  realism of those times. Moses gives seven great constructive periods of  light, which beautifully harmonize with the seven great geological ages  lying this side of his beginning. How he came to do this has perplexed the  incredulous scholar and historian beyond measure; it is, indeed, a  remarkable fact in literature, but it gives strength to the faith of the  intelligent Christian. God was with Moses; his cosmogony bears evidence of  inspiration. Compare his narrative with the cosmogonies of the ancient  nations. There is but little similitude; if there was much it would not  prove identity. It would be strange if the ancient nations should have no  truth in their cosmogonies. And if they had, would it not be more strange  for Moses to leave it out on that account? It would be well to remind you  just here that the Almighty, and doubtless his man Moses also, knew that  men possessed at least _common sense_. In the New Testament we have the  word tartarus in its verb form. Where did it come from? The Apostle Peter,  guided by the divine spirit, found it in Grecian mythology. Is it to be  thrown out on that account? Nay, verily. A man of God, that is, a prophet,  in any of the ancient ages as far back as Moses, is not to be regarded as  under obligations to shun a truth because it was already in use among men.  The man who would claim such a silly thing ought to be discarded from  scientific and literary circles as a blockhead. The cosmogony of the  Babylonians represents the beginning of things in darkness and water; in  which great non-descript animals, hideous monsters, half-beasts and  half-men, made their appearance; then a woman, who personates the creative  spirit or principle, was split into two parts, and the heaven and the  earth produced by the division. Next Belus, the supreme divinity, cut off  his own head, and his blood, trickling down and mingling with the dust of  the earth, produced human creatures having intelligence and spiritual  life. The Phoenician cosmogony presents, first, an ether or a mist diffused  in space. Next, a wind arose, and from this motion proceeded a Spiritual  God, from whom proceeded an egg, which, being divided, produced the  heavens and the earth. Next, the noise of thunder awakened beings into  spiritual life. The Egyptian cosmogony presents a principal divinity,  whose name was Ptah, the world-creating power, who shaped the cosmic egg,  which again appears here, as in the Phoenician. Next, there followed from  Ptah a long succession of gods, with many offices and powers--solar,  telluric and spiritual--from whom, after a time, proceeded _demigods_, and  then from these proceeded heroes, until the link of our humanity was  reached. According to Grote, Grecian mythology opens with the gods prior,  as well as superior, to man; it then descends gradually to heroes and then  to the human race. Along with their gods are presented many monsters,  ultra-human and extra-human, who can't consistently be styled gods, but  who partake with gods and man in the attributes of free-will, conscious  agency and susceptibility of pleasure and pain--such as the Harpies, the  Gorgons, the Sirens, the Sphinx, the Cyclops, the Centaurs, etc. After a  great struggle, or contest, among these wonderful creatures, there arises  a stable government of Zeus, the chief among the gods. Then appears chaos,  then the broad, firm, flat earth, with deep and dark tartarus below, and  from these proceed different divinities and creatures, some grand and  terrible, some simply monsters; their relations to each other violate all  notions of decency and morality; their wars and slaughters, their gross  and abominable crimes issue in successive creative products upon earth,  which terminate at last in the appearance of man.    Next we will give you the cosmogony of the Vedas, as it is presented in  what is known as the mystic hymn of the Vedas. It is _Pantheistic to the  core_. \"It is one of the earliest relics of Hindu thought and devotion:\"          \"Nor Aught nor Naught existed; yon bright sky      Was not, nor heaven's broad woof outstretched above.      What covered all? What sheltered? What concealed?      Was it the water's fathomless abyss?      There was not death--yet was there naught immortal;      There was no confine betwixt day and night;      The only One breathed breathless by itself;      OTHER than It NOTHING since has been.      Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled      In gloom profound--an ocean without light.      The germ that still lay covered in the husk      Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat.      Then first came love upon it, the new spring      Of mind--yea, poets in their hearts discerned,      Pondering, this bond between created things      And uncreated. Comes this spark from earth      Piercing and all-pervading, or from heaven?      Then seeds were sown, and mighty powers arose--      Nature below, and power and will above.      Who knows the secret? Who proclaimed it here?      Whence, whence this manifold creation sprang?      The gods themselves came later into being?      Who knows from whence this great creation sprang?      He from whom all this creation came,      Whether his will created or was mute,      The Most High Seer that is in highest heaven,      He knows it--or perchance even He knows it not.\"        --The Rig-Veda, book 10, hymn 129. Translated from Max Mullers'      \"Chips from a German Workshop.\"      This is Pantheistic throughout, and although it presents no absurd  combinations of matter and spirit, yet it puts the material creation  before the creation of the spiritual, and scarcely allows consciousness to  \"the One,\" \"the It,\" from which, somehow, the creation proceeded. The Book  of Menu, which is of equal value with the Veda among the Hindoos, gives  the following account of the creation:    \"Menu sat reclined, with his attention fixed on one object, the supreme  God, when the divine sages approached him, and, after mutual salutations  in due form, delivered the following address: Deign, sovereign ruler, to  apprise us of the sacred laws in their order, as they must be followed by  all the four classes, and by each of them, in their several degrees,  together with the duties of every mixed class; for thou, Lord, and thou  only among mortals, knowest the true sense, the first principle, and the  prescribed ceremonies of this universal, supernatural Veda, unlimited in  extent and unequalled in authority.    \"He whose powers were measureless, being thus requested by the great  sages, whose thoughts were profound, saluted them all with reverence and  gave them a comprehensive answer, saying: Be it heard! This universe  existed only in the first divine idea yet unexpanded, as if involved in  darkness, imperceptible, undefinable, undiscoverable by reason, and  undiscovered by revelation, as if it were wholly immersed in sleep; then  the sole, self-existing power, himself undiscovered, but making this world  discernible, with five elements and other principles of nature, appeared  with undiminished glory, expanding his idea or dispelling the gloom. He,  whom the mind alone can perceive, whose essence eludes the external  organs, who has not visible parts, who exists from eternity, even he, the  soul of all beings, whom no being can comprehend, shone forth in person.  He, having willed to produce various beings from his own divine substance,  first, with a thought, created the waters and placed in them a productive  seed; that seed became an egg bright as gold, blazing like the luminary  with a thousand beams; AND IN THAT EGG HE WAS BORN HIMSELF IN THE FORM OF  BRAHMA THE GREAT FOREFATHER OF ALL SPIRITS. The waters were called nara,  because they were the production of Nara, or the spirit of God; and, since  they were his first ayana, or place of motion, he thence is named  Nayrayana, or moving on the waters. From that which is, the first cause,  not the object of sense, existing everywhere in substance, not existing to  our perception, without beginning or end, was produced the divine male,  famed in all worlds under the appellation of Brahma. In that egg the great  power sat inactive a whole year of the Creator, at the close of which, by  his thought alone, he caused the egg to divide itself; and from its two  divisions he framed the heaven above and the earth beneath; in the midst  he placed the subtile ether, the eight regions, and the permanent  receptacle of waters.    \"From the supreme soul he drew forth mind, existing substantially, though  unperceived by sense, immaterial; and before mind, or the reasoning power,  he produced consciousness, the internal monitor, the ruler; and before  them both he produced the great principle of the soul, or first expansion  of the divine idea; and all vital forms endued with the three qualities of  goodness, passion and darkness; and the five perceptions of sense, and the  five organs of sensation. Thus, having at once pervaded, with emanations  from the Supreme Spirit, the minutest portions of six principles immensely  operative, consciousness and the five perceptions, he framed all  creatures; and since the minutest particles of visible nature have a  dependence on those six emanations from God, the wise have accordingly  given the name of S'arira, or depending on six, that is, the ten organs on  consciousness, and the five elements on as many perceptions, to his image  or appearance in visible nature; thence proceed the great elements, endued  with peculiar powers, the mind with operations infinitely subtile, the  unperishable cause of all apparent forms.    \"This universe, therefore, is compacted from the minute portions of these  seven divine and active principles, the"]]]
