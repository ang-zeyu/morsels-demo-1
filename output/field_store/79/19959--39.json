Why this? Was it because they had  discovered in the person of Christ an impostor, a mere cheat? No; this  alone would have caused them to utterly disregard the prediction of his  resurrection. Those priests saw something in the character of Christ  which caused them to fear the fulfillment of his prediction. What other  person ever created such a concern about such an event? There is not a  similar case in the world's history. What other dead person was ever  known to create such a feeling as that which moved his enemies to  confront him, if possible, in his rising power. Those priests had,  doubtless, witnessed his miracles again and again. It is beyond all  question true that they feared him in his death. If they had seen no  wonderful power exerted during his life they certainly would have feared  none after he was dead. The fear of the chief priests over the Savior's  dead body is an insurmountable evidence of the mighty works which he  accomplished during his life. Those priests addressed themselves to the  Roman governor, and requested a guard placed around the tomb; three days  and nights would settle the question, for the prediction would terminate  on the third day. Pilate granted the request, and a guard was set to  watch; they sealed the door of the sepulcher, placing the seal of the  state upon the great stone. The object of the seal was, doubtless, for  the satisfaction of all parties concerned in this matter.    It was a precaution against fraud. If the seal upon a door or box is  broken we know at once that it has been meddled with. When Darius thrust  Daniel among the lions he put his seal upon the door of the den, to  satisfy himself and his court that no human hand had interfered for  Daniel's delivery. When he came to the den and found his seal unbroken,  he was satisfied. A seal thus used is of the nature of a covenant. If  you deliver sealed writings to an individual his acceptance amounts to a  covenant between you that the same shall be delivered just as they were  received. If the seal is broken, it is a manifestation of attempted  fraud. There is no special agreement needed in order to the existence of  covenants by seals; it is an agreement which men are placed under by the  laws of nations. The sealing of the sepulcher where the body of Jesus  lay was to impose, by all the solemnities of the Roman state,  obligations upon all the parties interested in the person of Christ. It  was a grand effort on the part of the authorities to prevent any  interference with the dead body.    When impostors are known they become odious, and are but little noticed.  How was it with Christ? When the popular sentiment was that he was a  prophet the priests and scribes sought his life, believing that his  death would end his cause? When they and the people learned that he was  an impostor (?) they thought him unsafe after he was dead.    The prediction of Christ that he would rise the third day was publicly  known throughout Jerusalem; but why the chief priests should concern  themselves so much about it as to take all the steps to prevent its  fulfillment, is a puzzling question with infidels. Was it because they  had detected him as a cheat and an impostor? No, this is an unreasonable  conclusion. It must have been a secret conviction touching his mighty  power. The seal was a proper check upon the guards; the Jews could have  no other object in having it placed there. They were not so foolish as  to think, that by this contrivance they would outstrip Providence.    Guards were set to watch, and, doubtless, did their whole duty. But what  are sentinels when the power of Omnipotence is put forth? An angel of  the Lord makes his appearance. The keepers saw him, and fell down like  dead men. The angel rolled away the stone, and the conqueror came forth  to live in the hearts of millions, and to live forevermore.    The disciples, receiving power from on high, soon make their appearance  in Jerusalem, and boldly assert the fact of the resurrection. The  murderers of the Savior were there. What do the priests do next? They  had bribed the soldiers to tell a lie which was so base that it only  needed to be told in order to be known as a lie. Next, they arrest the  apostles; they beat them, they scourge them, and bid them shut their  mouths, and insist that they shall say no more about this matter. They  did not seem to regard them as liars and impostors, else they would  doubtless have charged them with the fraud. They try to assassinate and  murder these witnesses of the resurrection. They prevailed with Herod to  put one of them to death; but they never seemed to think of charging  them with stealing the body away. Their orator, Tertullus, could not  have missed such a topic as imposition and fraud if any had been  practiced. He did not seem to think of anything of the sort, but  contented himself with the charge of sedition, heresy, and the  profanation of the temple. Yet the very question of the resurrection was  under consideration; for Festus tells Agrippa, that the Jews had  \"certain questions against Paul of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul  affirmed to be alive.\" After this Agrippa heard Paul's testimony, and so  far was he from suspecting imposition, that he said, \"Almost thou  persuadest me to be a Christian.\"    Not long after the resurrection the apostles were taken before the  council and sanhedrim of the Children of Israel. They make their own  defense, a part of which is in these words: \"The God of our fathers  raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.\" The first impulse  of the council was to slay them all; but Gamaliel, one of the council,  stood up and related the history of several impostors who perished in  former days, and said: \"If this work be of men it will come to nought,  but if it be of God ye can not overthrow it.\" He advised them to refrain  from the men and let time tell the story. The tree shall be known by its  fruits. The council acquiesced; they gave the apostles a whipping and  let them go.    A resurrection is a thing to be ascertained by men's senses. We all know  whether a man is dead by the same means by which we know whether a man  is alive. There are those who claim that \"a resurrection could not be  proven by any amount of testimony, because of its being contrary to the  course of nature.\" But this is mere prejudice and ignorance. First: Who  can measure the extent of natural possibilities? Are they generally  known? Is it a greater thing to give life to a body once dead than to a  body that never was alive? The objection rests upon the thought that  testimony should be respected only in such cases as seem to us possible,  or in the ordinary course of nature. According to this, no amount of  evidence could establish the fact that water freezes and becomes solid  in a country where such is not the ordinary course of nature. Does a  man's ability in discerning and his truthfulness in reporting depend  upon the skill or ignorance of those who hear? We know facts that seem  to be as much contrary to the course of nature as anything could  possibly be. But, in all candor, I must claim that in appealing to the  settled course of nature, in a case like the one under consideration,  the question is referred not to the laws of evidence or maxims of  reason, but to the prejudices of men and to their mistakes, which are  many. Men form a notion of nature from what they see; so, under  different surroundings, their notions about the course of nature will  differ. The objection falls worthless at the feet of the INFINITE ONE.  There is no greater difficulty in accounting for the fact that the dead  live again than there is in accounting for the fact that they did live.          PUBLIC NOTORIETY OF THE SCRIPTURES.      Origen was born in the year one hundred and eighty-five of the Christian  dispensation, and lived sixty-eight years. He gives in his writings five  thousand seven hundred and sixty-five quotations from the New Testament.  Tertullian gives eighteen hundred and two quotations from the New  Testament. Clemens, of Alexandria, labored in the year one hundred and  ninety-four. He gives us three hundred and eighty-four quotations from  the New Testament. Ireneus lived in the year one hundred and  seventy-eight. He gives us seven hundred and sixty-seven quotations from  the New Testament, making a grand total of eight thousand seven hundred  and twenty-three quotations, given by four ancient writers.    If all the copies of the New Testament in the world were destroyed, the  whole, with the exception of eleven verses, could be reproduced from the  writings of men who lived prior to the Nicene Council. Unbelievers quote  from all ancient heathen authors as though they were books of yesterday,  without manifesting the least doubt in reference to their authenticity  or authorship. The evidences necessary to establish genuineness of  authorship are ten-fold greater in the case of the New Testament  Scriptures than in the case of the histories of Alexander, Julius Caesar  and Cyrus, as given by ancient writers.    The notoriety of the New Testament writings during the first centuries  is without a parallel among all ancient writings. Their effect upon  society during those centuries can never be explained in harmony with  unbelief. But this is not all that is to be considered. Their notoriety  extends over the centuries between us and the times of the apostles.  Such notoriety is the grand support upon which the New Testament stands.  All other ancient writings stand upon the same kind of evidence, but  this kind of evidence is more than ten-fold greater in the support of  our religion than it is in the support of any other ancient documents.    We may obtain some idea of the influence of the New Testament Scriptures  during the first centuries from the statements of Gibbon.

(Southey's Life, p. 47). But its  results were far different from those which either Wesley, or those who  wished him well, could have anticipated. For not only were his services  for the settlers rejected, and his mission to the Indians a failure. (R.  Watson's Life, p. 38.) On his voyage out he had fallen in with  twenty-six Moravian fellow-passengers, on their way from Germany to  settle in Georgia; and they spoilt all. On his as yet unsettled,  enthusiastic, self-dissatisfied frame of mind, the spectacle of their  confident, tranquil, yet fervid piety, fell like a spark on tinder. He  writes, in his journal, now first begun, 'From friends in England I am  awhile secluded; but God hath opened me a door into the whole Moravian  Church.' Here, Wesley learned, and took in, the doctrines of Peter  Bohler, the Moravian, who taught thus: First, when a man has a living  faith in Christ, then he is justified. Second, this living faith is  _always given in a moment_. Third, in that moment he has peace with God.  Fourth, which he can not have without knowing he has it. Fifth, and  being born of God he sinneth not. Sixth, and he can not have this  deliverance from sin, without knowing that he has it.\" (Southey's Life,  p. 113.)    Such is the origin of the Methodist tenet \"that there is a swift and  royal road, not only for some men, but for all men, by which the highest  spiritual things may be reached at a bound.\" Under such an impression  John Wesley set about realizing an instantaneous and sensible  conversion. If a man under high mental excitement is looking for such a  thing to occur, something will take place sooner or later that will  answer the expectation. So, on Wednesday, May 24, 1738, about nine  o'clock in the evening, at a society's meeting in Aldersgate street,  Wesley persuaded himself that he had felt the desired transition and had  passed--from what, to what? In the answer to that question lies the  whole doctrinal difference between modern Methodism and the Church of  England. Stevens, in his history of Methodism 1, 108, says, Methodism  owes to Moravianism special obligations: (1) It introduced Wesley into  that regenerated spiritual life, the supremacy of which over all  ecclesiasticism and dogmatism it was the appointed mission of Methodism  to reassert. But a still stranger event occurred in John Wesley's life,  which contributed still farther to darken and confuse his teaching at  this critical period of his career. He had been carried away by his love  of the Moravians so far as to take a long journey, and to visit the  headquarters of their communion at Hernhutt, in Saxony. There he had  been an honored guest at the retreat which the enthusiast Count  Zinzendorf had carved out of his estate for these hunted Bohemian  followers of Huss and Wickliff. But he had returned home, after a brief  residence among them, as Luther returned from Rome, not a little shaken  in his allegiance to their system. Indeed, shortly afterwards he broke  from them entirely; set up a sort of English Moravianism of his own, and  organized it with \"bands\" and \"class-meetings\" on the Moravian model.  But his feelings as a churchman revolted against their  ultra-spiritualism; repudiated their doctrine that sacraments and  outward means were nothing, and protested that a man must do something  more than wait, in quietude, until the influx of God's spirit came upon  him, and filled, like a rising tide, all the sluices and channels of his  soul. But no sooner had this unquiet soul emancipated itself from one  foreign influence than it was warped out of its true course by another.  _German mysticism_ had done its work on him, and its doctrine of  regeneration into God's kingdom by an interior convulsion of the mind  had left its mark upon Wesleyanism for all future time. But just as this  extravagance seemed likely to subside, and to be absorbed amid the  healthier atmosphere of an English churchman's common sense, most  unhappily a strong breath of _French fanaticism_ suddenly set across his  path, from quite another quarter. And the singular phenomenon now  presented itself of an epidemic religious-hysteria commingling with, and  emphasizing into lamentable extravagance, all the most dangerous  features of the Methodist-Moravian doctrine about the new birth. So  wonderfully is all the world connected together! * * * * *    These French \"convulsionists,\" who had, just before this time, brought  their curious mental malady with them into England, were refugees from  the atrocious _dragonnades_ of Louis the XIV. Maddened by his abominable  and relentless persecutions, deprived by his autocratic edicts of all  that life held dear, robbed of their children at the sweet age of seven  years old, broken on the wheel, hunted among the mountains of the  Cevennes, beggared, insulted, tortured, massacred--what wonder that  these poor Protestants lost the balance of their mental powers and  engendered a hysterical disease? The disease is (I believe), under its  strangely mutable forms, well known to medical science, though science  has never yet been able to probe all its mysterious depths. Its seat is,  apparently, the great nervous ganglia of nutrition, which lie in the  center of the body, and whose strange sympathetic action with and upon  the brain has led to all the popular notions about the heart and  neighboring organs being the seat of various impassioned feelings.  Suffice it, however, at present, to observe that the phenomena which  this extraordinary and infectious disease presented had sufficed to  cheer the faith and animate the ardor of the Calvinists in the Cevennes  against Rome.    The Cevennes is a range of mountains in the south of France, divided  into N. and S. * * a wild rugged country, and the abode of many  Protestants, who here maintained themselves against the persecutions of  their enemies. (See _Cavalier Jean_). Such, in fact, were the causes of  the extasies or irregular inspirations; the want of spiritual guides and  schools, spoliation, suffering, liability to torture, and constant  apprehension of the galley or the gibbet, the minds of these unfortunate  creatures became excited. * * *    This religious enthusiasm began in Vivarais, an old territory of France,  in Languedoc, on the Rhone, with the dragonnades and the revocation,  repeal of an edict, about the year 1686.    A practical proof of the morbific power of the emotions and passions is  found in the frequent occurrence of _psychopathitis_ in times when all  the elements of social life are in a state of fermentation. In and after  revolutions sudden changes of fortune produce a thousand cases of mental  disorder.    The very same disease broke out among the Romanists themselves, at Port  Royal, in 1729. In the previous century it had thrown whole nunneries  near Bordeaux into wild confusion. In the sixteenth century it was known  in Italy as the \"Dancing Mania,\" or Tarantism. At the close of the  fifteenth century _Tarantism_ had spread beyond the borders of Apulia. *  * * The number of those affected by it increased beyond all belief.  Inquisitive females joined the throng and caught the disease from the  mental poison which they eagerly received _through the eye_. * * *  Foreigners of every color and race were, in like manner, affected by it.  Neither youth nor age afforded any protection; so that even old men of  ninety threw aside their crutches, and joined the most extravagant  dancers. * * * Subordinate nervous attacks were much more frequent  during the seventeenth century, than at any former period. (Hecker,  Epidemics of the Middle Ages, pp. 107-115, Engl. Trans.)    During the Middle Ages it appeared in Germany. It was a convulsion,  which in the most extraordinary manner infuriated the human frame; * * *  and was propogated by the _sight_ of the sufferers. They continued  dancing, for hours together, in wild delirium, until at length they  fell to the ground in a state of exhaustion. They then complained of  extreme oppression, and groaned as if in the agonies of death. * * *  They were haunted by visions, and some of them afterwards asserted that  they had felt as if immersed in a _stream of blood_, which obliged them  to leap so high. George Fox, Journal 1, p. 100: \"The word of the Lord  came to me again. * * * So I went up and down the streets crying, Woe to  the bloody city, Lichfield! And there seemed to me to be a channel of  blood running down the streets, and the market-place appeared like a  pool of blood.\" In Germany it was called St. John's or St. Vitus's  dance. And long before its first appearance in that precise form, in  1374, it had, no doubt, been the real secret of the bacchanalian orgies  among the Greeks, and of the frantic, dervish-like gestures and cuttings  with knives and lancets which we read of among Asiatic races. In our own  day and country (thank God) these extraordinary and degrading spectacles  are scarcely to be seen.    But the disease still lurks among the superstitious Christians of Tigre  in Abyssinia; in Siberia; among the revivalists of Ireland and America;  and (in a very mild form), among the ignorant Welsh Methodists,--who are  on this account popularly called \"Jumpers.\" Now it so happened that  these poor hysterical French refugees had arrived in great numbers in  London, and had also visited Bristol, shortly before the critical year  1739,--when the excitable George Whitfield landed from America, and John  Wesley returned home from Germany. Men's thoughts were then full of the  (so called) \"French prophets.\" A new religious enthusiasm was floating  in the atmosphere, and it only needed the impulse of some exciting  preaching, and the mental tension which is always produced among  expectant and "]]]
