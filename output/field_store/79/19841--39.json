Just how this affects the mind and body will be  discussed in detail in a subsequent chapter.      2. PSYCHICAL CHANGES.    Play and Work.    a. =Sports.=--Most of the higher animals, particularly man, and all  races of men, devote a large part of the energies of the adolescent  period to sports or games in which individuals contend with each other  or teams of individuals contend with opposing teams in games that  bring into play the various powers of the neuro-muscular system: such  as alertness of all the senses, readiness and correctness of judgment,  agility, speed and strength of movement. Sports might be criticised by  some because they represent non-productive expenditure of energy. On  the other hand, no energy ever expended by man is so highly productive  of so precious a material as results from manly athletic sports. The  products of these games are the substances consumed by them,  paradoxical as that may at first appear. The use of brain, muscle and  glands and the consumption of the cell substances of these tissues  results in the development of the nerve, muscle and gland cells into  a condition larger, better equipped and more responsive than before  such use.    Thus, athletic sports, while they make draughts upon the nerves,  muscles and glands, develop all of these tissues to a high degree of  efficiency. The plan of nature in this instinctive indulgence in  sports must be evident. Nature is educating and developing the male  animal (man) to the highest possible degree of efficiency, so that  sports, instead of being non-productive, lead to the development of  structures possessing a high degree of value, not only to the  individual, but also to society.    Furthermore, those qualities of mind that are encouraged on the  athletic field between contestants in a game are the qualities that in  the later serious struggles of life make most for success.    b. =Productive Employment.=--Hardly less important than the influence  of sports is that of productive employment for the adolescent. That  the adolescent youth should not be assigned tasks that overtax his  physical or mental powers goes without saying, nor should he be  assigned tasks that consume so much of his time that he is unable to  take an active part with his fellows in field sports. However,  experience demonstrates that the youth undergoes a more wholesome all  around development if he takes some active part in a productive  employment, than if allowed to devote all of his energies to play.  The simple fact that he is held responsible for some duty about the  home or the shop develops in the youth not only a knowledge of how to  do things and a sympathy with the adults who are devoting their  strength largely to similar tasks, but--more important than either of  these considerations--these tasks develop in him the ability to  accomplish promptly and efficiently some piece of work as a duty--to  do it regularly and promptly because it is a duty without any  reference to a personal enjoyment in the task. If this important  lesson in life is learned during the early adolescent period, it will  make the path of life much less rugged than some seem to find it.      Society.    Incident to the activities of the athletic field, the youth is brought  into more or less intimate contact with fellows of his kind, both of  the same and of the opposite sex. While the boy of ten to fifteen  delights in the forming of \"cliques, gangs and crowds,\" the boy of  seventeen delights equally in widening his circle of acquaintances.  The athletic contest gives him an opportunity not only to measure his  powers with those of the other young men, but also to win the respect  of his young lady acquaintances. There is no doubt but that the  approbation of his young lady friends for his prowess and strength as  manifested in sports, serves as a strong factor in the stimulation of  athletic contests and in bringing the sexes together in a purely  social capacity.      Religion.    While in his social relations the young man is seeking points of  tangency with those in his own plane, in his religious experience he  seeks to come into relation with his God; that is, with the power that  exists in the plane above his own. In the researches of Coe and of  Starbuck, made several years ago they discovered the following truth  and demonstrated it as a general principle: _(1) A vast majority of  professing Christians acknowledged their allegiance to God during the  early part of the adolescent period; and (2) a vanishingly small  percentage of professing Christians became so after the age of  twenty-five._          CHAPTER III.    ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MALE GENITAL ORGANS.          ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MALE GENITAL ORGANS.      1. ANATOMY.    The external genitals of the human male consist of the penis and  scrotum, the latter containing the testes.    The _penis_ of the young man who has completed the stage of puberty  consists (1) of the two corpora cavernosa, as they are called, or  erectile bodies, called cavernosa because they contain numerous blood  sinuses which when filled cause the organ to erect. (2) Between and  beneath the corpora cavernosa lies the corpus spongiosum which  consists principally of the urethra. Around these three cylindrical  bodies there is a sheath of loose connective tissue, outside of which  is the skin.    About one inch of the distal end of the organ is differentiated into a  sort of head which is called the _glans_ over which, in the young  child, the skin is redoubled and called the _prepuce_ or foreskin. The  glans is covered and the prepuce is lined by mucous membrane. Over the  glans the mucous membrane is red, thin and moist and possesses  numerous nerve papillae. The prepuce, as stated above, usually covers  the glans penis in young children and may do so throughout life. It is  sometimes adherent to the glans. This is abnormal, and as soon as it  is discovered the adhesions should be broken up by a physician. The  normal prepuce of the adolescent male should be free from the glans  and should be sufficiently loose easily to retract back of the glans,  a position it is likely to take in erection. If the prepuce extends  half an inch or more beyond the glans penis as a little flap of skin,  or if it is constricted at the opening so that it is difficult to  clear the glans or to replace the prepuce when it is once back of the  glans, the condition is not normal, and should have the attention of a  competent surgeon.    One can easily understand the need of a prepuce in the case of  primeval man, who was practically unprotected by clothing, but in the  present condition of civilized races the prepuce is certainly an  unnecessary appendage, and there are several good reasons why the  prepuce should be removed. This operation [circumcision] is not, in  any sense, to be looked upon as a mutilation, but simply a hygienic  measure made advisable, if not necessary, by the unnatural conditions  under which we are now existing.    Beneath the prepuce cheesy secretions from the glands back of the head  of the penis collect, and if the organ is not frequently cleansed  these accumulated secretions may serve as an irritant. Such local  irritation is one of the most prevalent causes of masturbation in  boys.    The removal of the prepuce in young children is an exceedingly simple  operation and not by any means difficult or dangerous in the adult. If  the prepuce is removed the organ will need no especial care, as  contact with the clothing will remove the secretions as they appear.  Furthermore, the glans penis becomes less sensitive and therefore less  subject to local irritation thus simplifying the young man's problems  in sexual hygiene.    The penis in its flaccid state varies considerably in size, due not  only to varying conditions of temperature but also to individual  peculiarities. The organ may vary between 2-1/2 inches and 6 inches in  length in the flaccid state and between 5 inches and 8 inches in the  erected condition. The size of the generative organs is not an index  of virility in the male.    The _testes_ are the male generative glands and are described as about  1-1/2 inches in length, 1-1/4 inches in width and nearly 1 inch in  thickness. The testes are contained within the scrotal sac, the  outside coat of which is a thin wrinkled skin, within which are four  thin coats. Next to the testes and enveloping the spermatic cord is a  thin covering which is carried down into the scrotum when the testicle  leaves the abdomen, where it is formed. This descent of the testes  from the abdomen takes place normally in the later weeks of  intrauterine life. The testes may, however, through some unusual  condition, be retained and make their descent months or even years  later. If the testes have not descended by the end of the age of  puberty, the advice of a competent surgeon should be sought.             { TESTICULAR                  { SPERMATOZOA           {  CONTRIBUTION.              { SEMINAL GRANULES           {                             { MUCIN AND WATER           {    SEMEN  { VESICULAR                   { ALBUMIN           {  CONTRIBUTION.              { ALKALINE SALTS           { (In quantity greater        { WATER           {  than all the rest.)           {           { PROSTATIC                   { PROTEINS           {  CONTRIBUTION.              { ALKALINE SALTS           { (Viscid and opalescent.)    { WATER        [Illustration: Plate II Male Sexual Apparatus]    The outer coat of the testis is called the tunica albuginea.

Once upon a time she had helped the fox to  escape from a trap and the fox had never forgotten her kindness to  him.    \"O, little white hen, where are you going?\" asked the fox.    \"Quirrichi, quirrichi,\" replied the little white hen, \"I am going to  the royal palace to carry a letter to the king.\"    \"Indeed, little white hen,\" said the fox, \"I should like to go with  you. Give me your permission to accompany you on your journey.\"    \"I shall be glad to have you go with me,\" said the little white hen.  \"It is a very long journey to the royal palace where the king lives.  Wouldn't you like me to carry you in my little brown basket?\"    The fox climbed into the little brown basket. After the little white  hen had gone on for some distance farther she met a river. Once upon a  time the little white hen had done the river a kindness. He had, with  great difficulty, thrown some ugly worms upon the bank and he was  afraid they would crawl back in again. The little white hen had eaten  them for him. Always after that the river had been her friend.    \"O, little white hen, where are you going?\" the river called out as  soon as he saw her.    \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, I am going to the royal palace to carry a  letter to the king,\" replied the little white hen.    \"O, little white hen, may I go with you?\" asked the river.    The little white hen told the river that he might go with her and  asked him to ride in the little brown basket. So the river climbed  into the little brown basket.    After the little white hen had journeyed along for a time she came to  a fire. Once upon a time, when the fire had been dying the little  white hen had brought some dried grass. The grass had given the fire  new life and always after that he had been the friend of the little  white hen.    \"O, little white hen, where are you going?\" the fire asked.    \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, I am going to the royal palace to carry a  letter to the king,\" replied the little white hen.    \"O, little white hen, may I go with you?\" asked the fire. \"I have  never been to the royal palace and I have never had even a peep at the  king.\"    The little white hen told the fire that he might go with her and asked  him to climb into the little brown basket. By this time the little  brown basket was so full, that, try as they might, they couldn't make  room for the fire. At last they thought of a plan. The fire changed  himself into ashes and then there was room for him to get into the  basket.    The little white hen journeyed on and on, and finally she arrived at  the royal palace.    \"Who are you and what are you carrying in your little brown basket?\"  asked the royal doorkeeper when he opened the door.    \"I am the little white hen and I am carrying a letter to the king,\"  replied the little white hen. She didn't say a word about the fox and  the river and the fire which she had in her little brown basket. She  was so frightened before the great royal doorkeeper of the palace that  she could hardly find her voice at all.    The royal doorkeeper invited the little white hen to enter the palace  and he led her to the royal throne where the king was sitting. The  little white hen bowed very low before the king--so low, in fact, that  it mussed up all her feathers.    \"Who are you and what is your business?\" asked the king in his big,  deep, kingly voice.    \"Quirrichi, quirrichi, I am the little white hen,\" replied the little  white hen in her low, frightened, little voice. \"I have come to bring  my letter to your royal majesty.\" She handed the king the piece of  paper which had remained all this time at the bottom of the little  brown basket. There were marks of dirt upon it where the friendly  fox's feet had rested. It was damp where the river had lain. It had  tiny holes in it where the fire had sat after he had turned himself  into hot ashes.    \"What do you mean by bringing me this dirty piece of paper?\" shouted  the king in his biggest, deepest, gruffest voice. \"I am highly  offended. I always knew that hens were stupid little creatures but you  are quite the stupidest little hen I ever saw in all my life.\"    \"Here,\" and he turned to one of the attendants standing by the throne,  \"take this stupid, little white hen and throw her out into the royal  poultry yard. I think we will have her for dinner to-morrow.\"    The little white hen was roughly seized by the tallest royal attendant  and carried down the back stairs, through the back gate, out into the  royal poultry yard. She still clung to the little brown basket which  she had brought with her on her long journey to the royal palace and  through all the sad experiences she had met there.    When the little white hen reached the royal poultry yard all the royal  fowls flew at her. Some plucked at her rumpled white feathers. Others  tried to pick out her eyes. One pulled off the cover of the little  brown basket.    Out sprang the fox from the little brown basket and in the twinkling  of an eye he fell upon the fowls of the royal poultry yard. Not a  single fowl was left alive.    There was such a great commotion that the king, the queen, the royal  attendants and all the royal servants of the palace came rushing out  to see what was the matter. The fox had already taken to his heels and  the little white hen lost no time in running away too. She did not,  however, forget to take her little brown basket with her.    The royal household all ran after her in swift pursuit. They had  almost caught her when the river suddenly sprang out of the little  brown basket and flowed between the little white hen and her royal  pursuers. They couldn't get across without canoes.    While they were getting the canoes and climbing into them the little  white hen had time to run a long way. She had almost reached a thick  forest where she could easily hide herself when the royal pursuers  again drew near. Then the fire which had changed itself into hot ashes  jumped out of the little brown basket. It immediately became dark, so  dark that the royal household could not even see each other's faces  and, of course, they could not see in which direction the little  white hen was running. There was nothing for them to do but to return  to the royal palace and live on beef and mutton.    The fire which had turned itself into ashes sprang out of the little  brown basket so suddenly that it scattered ashes all over the little  white hen. From that day she was always speckled where the ashes fell  upon her. The chickens of the little white hen (who was now a little  speckled hen) were all speckled too. So were their chickens and their  chickens and their chickens' chickens, even down to this very day.  Whenever you see a speckled hen you may know that she is descended  from the little white hen who carried a letter to the king, and who,  in her adventures, became the first speckled hen.          VIII    How the Monkey Became a    Trickster      Once upon a time there was a beautiful garden in which grew all sorts  of fruits. Many beasts lived in the garden and they were permitted to  eat of the fruits whenever they wished. But they were asked to observe  one rule. They must make a low, polite bow to the fruit tree, call it  by its name, and say, \"Please give me a taste of your fruit.\" They had  to be very careful to remember the tree's correct name and not to  forget to say \"please.\" It was also very important that they should  remember not to be greedy. They must always leave plenty of fruit for  the other beasts who might pass that way, and plenty to adorn the tree  itself and to furnish seed so that other trees might grow. If they  wished to eat figs they had to say, \"O, fig tree, O, fig tree, please  give me a taste of your fruit;\" or, if they wished to eat oranges they  had to say, \"O, orange tree, O, orange tree, please give me a taste of  your fruit.\"    In one corner of the garden grew the most splendid tree of all. It was  tall and beautiful and the rosy-cheeked fruit upon its wide spreading  branches looked wonderfully tempting. No beast had ever tasted of that  fruit, for no beast could ever remember its name.    In a tiny house near the edge of the garden dwelt a little old woman  who knew the names of all the fruit trees which grew in the garden.  The beasts often went to her and asked the name of the wonderful fruit  tree, but the tree was so far distant from the tiny house of the  little old woman that no beast could ever remember the long, hard name  by the time he reached the fruit tree.    At last the monkey thought of a trick. Perhaps you do not know it, but  the monkey can play the guitar. He always played when the beasts  gathered together in the garden to dance. The monkey went to the tiny  house of the little old woman, carrying his guitar under his arm. When  she told him the long hard name of the wonderful fruit tree he made up  a little tune to it, all his own, and sang it over and over again all  the way from the tiny house of the little old woman to the corner of  the garden where the wonderful fruit tree grew. When any of the other  beasts met him and asked him what new song he was singing to his  guitar, he said never a word. He marched straight on, playing his  little tune over and over again on his guitar and singing softly the  long hard name.    At last he reached the corner of the garden where the wonderful fruit  tree grew. He had never seen it look so beautiful. The rosy-cheeked  fruit glowed in the bright sunlight. The monkey could hardly wait to  make his bow, say the long hard name over twice and ask for the fruit  with a \"please.\" What a beautiful colour and what a delicious odour  that fruit had! The monkey had never in all his life been so near to  anything which smelled so good. He took a big bite. What a face he  made! That beautiful sweet smelling fruit was bitter and sour, and it  had a nasty taste. He threw it away from him as far as he could.    The"]]]
