Really to mean every word you said, when you repeated the  Athanasian Creed! How wonderful! And what enticing and mysterious vistas  burst upon the view! But then, those vistas, where were they leading?  Supposing--oh heavens!--supposing after all they were to lead to--!      III    IN due course, the Tracts made their appearance at the remote rectory in  Sussex. Manning was some years younger than Newman, and the two men had  only met occasionally at the University; but now, through common  friends, a closer relationship began to grow up between them. It was  only to be expected that Newman should be anxious to enroll the rising  young Rector among his followers; and, on Manning's side, there were  many causes which impelled him to accept the overtures from Oxford.    He was a man of a serious and vigorous temperament, to whom it was  inevitable that the bold high principles of the Movement should strongly  appeal. There was also an element in his mind that element which had  terrified him in his childhood with Apocalyptic visions, and urged him  in his youth to Bible readings after breakfast--which now brought him  under the spell of the Oxford theories of sacramental mysticism. And  besides, the Movement offered another attraction: it imputed an  extraordinary, transcendent merit to the profession which Manning  himself pursued. The cleric was not as his lay brethren; he was a  creature apart, chosen by Divine will and sanctified by Divine  mysteries. It was a relief to find, when one had supposed that one was  nothing but a clergyman, that one might, after all, be something  else--one might be a priest.    Accordingly, Manning shook off his early Evangelical convictions,  started an active correspondence with Newman, and was soon working for  the new cause. He collected quotations, and began to translate the works  of Optatus for Dr. Pusey. He wrote an article on Justin for the British  Critic, \"Newman's Magazine\". He published a sermon on Faith, with notes  and appendices, which was condemned by an evangelical bishop, and  fiercely attacked by no less a person than the celebrated Mr. Bowdler.  'The sermon,' said Mr Bowdler, in a book which he devoted to the  subject, 'was bad enough, but the appendix was abominable.' At the same  time he was busy asserting the independence of the Church of England,  opposing secular education, and bringing out pamphlets against the  Ecclesiastical Commission, which had been appointed by Parliament to  report on Church Property. Then we find him in the role of a spiritual  director of souls. Ladies met him by stealth in his church, and made  their confessions. Over one case--that of a lady, who found herself  drifting towards Rome--he consulted Newman. Newman advised him to  'enlarge upon the doctrine of I Cor. vii';    'also, I think you must press on her the prospect of benefiting the poor  Church, through which she has her baptism, by stopping in it. Does she  not care for the souls of all around her, steeped and stifled in  Protestantism? How will she best care for them by indulging her own  feelings in the communion of Rome, or in denying herself, and staying in  sackcloth and ashes to do them good?'    Whether these arguments were successful does not appear.    For several years after his wife's death, Manning was occupied with  these new activities, while his relations with Newman developed into  what was apparently a warm friendship. 'And now vive valeque, my dear  Manning', we find Newman writing in a letter dated 'in festo S. Car.  1838', 'as wishes and prays yours affectionately, John H. Newman'. But,  as time went on, the situation became more complicated. Tractarianism  began to arouse the hostility, not only of the evangelical, but of the  moderate churchmen, who could not help perceiving in the ever-deepening,  'catholicism' of the Oxford party, the dread approaches of Rome. The  \"Record\" newspaper an influential Evangelical journal--took up the  matter and sniffed Popery in every direction; it spoke of certain  clergymen as 'tainted'; and after that, preferment seemed to pass those  clergymen by. The fact that Manning found it wise to conduct his  confessional ministrations in secret was in itself highly significant.  It was necessary to be careful, and Manning was very careful indeed. The  neighbouring Archdeacon, Mr. Hare, was a low churchman; Manning made  friends with him, as warmly, it seemed, as he had made friends with  Newman. He corresponded with him, asked his advice about the books he  should read, and discussed questions of Theology--'As to Gal. vi 15, we  cannot differ.... With a man who reads and reasons I can have no  controversy; and you do both.' Archdeacon Hare was pleased, but soon a  rumour reached him, which was, to say the least of it, upsetting.  Manning had been removing the high pews from a church in Brighton, and  putting in open benches in their place. Everyone knew what that meant;  everyone knew that a high pew was one of the bulwarks of Protestantism,  and that an open bench had upon it the taint of Rome. But Manning  hastened to explain:    'My dear friend,' he wrote, 'I did not exchange pews for open benches,  but got the pews (the same in number) moved from the nave of the church  to the walls of the side aisles, so that the whole church has a regular  arrangement of open benches, which (irregularly) existed before ... I am  not today quite well, so farewell, with much regard--Yours ever, H. E.  M.'    Archdeacon Hare was reassured.    It was important that he should be, for the Archdeacon of Chichester was  growing very old, and Hare's influence might be exceedingly useful when  a vacancy occurred. So, indeed, it fell out. A new bishop, Dr.  Shuttleworth, was appointed to the See, and the old Archdeacon took the  opportunity of retiring. Manning was obviously marked out as his  successor, but the new bishop happened to be a low churchman, an  aggressive low churchman, who went so far as to parody the Tractarian  fashion of using Saints' days for the dating of letters by writing 'The  Palace, washing-day', at the beginning of his. And--what was equally  serious--his views were shared by Mrs. Shuttleworth, who had already  decided that the pushing young Rector was 'tainted'. But at the critical  moment Archdeacon Hare came to the rescue; he persuaded the Bishop that  Manning was safe; and the appointment was accordingly made--behind Mrs.  Shuttleworth's back. She was furious, but it was too late; Manning was  an Archdeacon. All the lady could do, to indicate her disapprobation,  was to put a copy of Mr. Bowdler's book in a conspicuous position on the  drawing-room table, when he came to pay his respects at the Palace.    Among the letters of congratulation which Manning received, was one from  Mr Gladstone, with whom he had remained on terms of close friendship  since their days together at Oxford.    'I rejoice,' Mr Gladstone wrote, 'on your account personally; but more  for the sake of the Church. All my brothers-in-law are here and scarcely  less delighted than I am. With great glee am I about to write your new  address; but, the occasion really calls for higher sentiments; and sure  am I that you are one of the men to whom it is specially given to  develop the solution of that great problem--how all our minor  distractions are to be either abandoned, absorbed, or harmonised through  the might of the great principle of communion in the body of Christ.'    Manning was an Archdeacon; but he was not yet out of the woods. His  relations with the Tractarians had leaked out, and the Record was  beginning to be suspicious. If Mrs. Shuttleworth's opinion of him were  to become general, it would certainly be a grave matter. Nobody could  wish to live and die a mere Archdeacon. And then, at that very moment,  an event occurred which made it imperative to take a definite step, one  way or the other. That event was the publication of Tract No. 90.    For some time it had been obvious to every impartial onlooker that  Newman was slipping down an inclined plane at the bottom of which lay  one thing, and one thing only--the Roman Catholic Church. What was  surprising was the length of time which he was taking to reach the  inevitable destination. Years passed before he came to realise that his  grandiose edifice of a Church Universal would crumble to pieces if one  of its foundation stones was to be an amatory intrigue of Henry VIII.  But, at last he began to see that terrible monarch glowering at him  wherever he turned his eyes. First he tried to exorcise the spectre with  the rolling periods of the Caroline divines; but it only strutted the  more truculently. Then in despair he plunged into the writings of the  early Fathers, and sought to discover some way out of his difficulties  in the complicated labyrinth of ecclesiastical history. After months  spent in the study of the Monophysite heresy, the alarming conclusion  began to force itself upon him that the Church of England was perhaps in  schism. Eventually he read an article by a Roman Catholic on St.  Augustine and the Donatists, which seemed to put the matter beyond  doubt. St. Augustine, in the fifth century, had pointed out that the  Donatists were heretics because the Bishop of Rome had said so. The  argument was crushing; it rang in Newman's ears for days and nights;  and, though he continued to linger on in agony for six years more, he  never could discover any reply to it. All he could hope to do was to  persuade himself and anyone else who liked to listen to him that the  holding of Anglican orders was not inconsistent with a belief in the  whole cycle of Roman doctrine as laid down at the Council of Trent. In  this way he supposed that he could at once avoid the deadly sin of  heresy and conscientiously remain a clergyman in the Church of England;  and with this end in view, he composed Tract No. 90.

Walking behind the camel were the weeping children and  their mother. Then came the foot soldiers guarding the treasure. The  King made the camel kneel down, and with his own hands undid the cruel  bonds.    Then with tears running down his face, Abdul knelt before the King and  pleaded for his dear ones, saying: \"If thou slay me, at least let these  innocent ones go free!\"    Lifting Abdul from the ground, the King then said: \"I am come to honor,  not to slay thee. When thou hast rested, thou shalt return to thine own  province, not as a prisoner, but as the Governor thereof.\" And smiling,  he added:    \"Already is the silk dress prepared for Zeeba; the horse and sword for  Yusuf; and the Indian handkerchief and the golden slippers for Fatima  have not been forgotten.\" For the King had read in the report of the  chief of police all the details of Abdul's case.    And so it was that Abdul's piety and gift to the shrine had come back,  not a hundredfold, but beyond his wildest dreams, and the shrine and  the poor benefited greatly thereby.        THE KING AND THE FISHERMAN      PERSIAN FAIRY TALES      The King and the Fisherman      Illustrating the advantage of being able to formulate a judicious reply  to an embarrassing question, especially when material plenitude may  ensue.    THE countries washed by the great rivers Tigris and Euphrates were once  ruled by a certain King who was passionately fond of fish.    He was seated one day with Sherem, his wife, in the royal gardens that  stretch down to the banks of the Tigris, at the point where it is  spanned by the wonderful bridge of boats; and looking up spied a boat  gliding by, in which was seated a fisherman having a large fish.    Noticing that the King was looking closely at him, and knowing how much  the King liked this particular kind of fish, the fisherman made his  obeisance, and skilfully bringing his boat to the shore, came before  the King and begged that he would accept the fish as a present. The  King was greatly pleased at this, and ordered that a large sum of money  be given to the fisherman.    But before the fisherman had left the royal presence, the Queen turned  towards the King and said: \"You have done a foolish thing.\" The King  was astonished to hear her speak in this way, and asked how that could  be. The Queen replied:    \"The news of your having given so large a reward for so small a gift  will spread through the city and it will be known as the fisherman's  gift. Every fisherman who catches a big fish will bring it to the  palace, and should he not be paid in like manner, he will go away  discontented, and secretly speak evil of you among his fellows.\"    \"Thou speakest the truth, light of my eyes,\" said the King, \"but can  not you see how mean it would be for a King, if for that reason he were  to take back his gift?\" Then perceiving that the Queen was ready to  argue the matter, he turned away angrily, saying: \"The matter is  closed.\"    However, later in the day, when he was in a more amiable frame of mind,  the Queen again approached him, and said that if that was his only  reason for not taking back his gift, she would arrange it. \"You must  summon the fisherman,\" she said, \"and then ask him, 'Is this fish male  or female?' If he says male, then you will tell him that you wanted a  female fish; but if he should say female, your reply will be that you  wanted a male fish. In this way the matter will be properly adjusted.\"    The King thought this an easy way out of the difficulty, and commanded  the fisherman to be brought before him. When the fisherman, who by the  way, was a most intelligent man, stood before the King, the King said  to him: \"O fisherman, tell me, is this fish male or female?\"    The fisherman replied, \"The fish is neither male nor female.\" Whereupon  the King smiled at the clever answer, and to add to the Queen's  annoyance, directed the keeper of the royal purse to give the fisherman  a further sum of money.    Then the fisherman placed the money in his leather bag, thanked the  King, and swinging the bag over his shoulder, hurried away, but not so  quickly that he did not notice that he had dropped one small coin.  Placing the bag on the ground, he stooped and picked up the coin, and  again went on his way, with the King and Queen carefully watching his  every action.    \"Look! what a miser he is!\" said Sherem, triumphantly. \"He actually put  down his bag to pick up one small coin because it grieved him to think  that it might reach the hands of one of the King's servants, or some  poor person, who, needing it, would buy bread and pray for the long  life of the King.\"    \"Again thou speakest the truth,\" replied the King, feeling the justice  of this remark; and once more was the fisherman brought into the royal  presence. \"Are you a human being or a beast?\" the King asked him.  \"Although I made it possible for you to become rich without toil, yet  the miser within you could not allow you to leave even one small piece  of money for others.\" Then the King bade him to go forth and show his  face no more within the city.    At this the fisherman fell on his knees and cried: \"Hear me, O King,  protector of the poor! May God grant the King a long life. Not for its  value did thy servant pick up the coin, but because on one side it bore  the name of God, and on the other the likeness of the King. Thy servant  feared that someone, not seeing the coin, would tread it into the dirt,  and thus defile both the name of God and the face of the King. Let the  King judge if by so doing I have merited reproach.\"    This answer pleased the King beyond all measure, and he gave the  fisherman another large sum of money. And the Queen's wrath was turned  away, and she looked kindly upon the fisherman as he departed with his  bag laden with money."]]]
