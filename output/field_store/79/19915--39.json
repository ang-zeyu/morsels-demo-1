He reminded her of those Italian artists  whom she had seen at the French court, and spoke to her the tongue of  Marot and Ronsard, whose most beautiful poems he knew by heart: this was  more than enough to please Mary Stuart. In a short time he became her  favourite, and meanwhile the place of secretary for the French  despatches falling vacant, Rizzio was provided for with it.    Darnley, who wished to succeed at all costs, enlisted Rizzio in his  interests, unconscious that he had no need of this support; and as, on  her side, Mary, who had fallen in love with him at first sight, fearing  some new intrigue of Elizabeth's, hastened on this union so far as the  proprieties permitted, the affair moved forward with wonderful rapidity;  and in the midst of public rejoicing, with the approbation of the  nobility, except for a small minority, with Murray at its head, the  marriage was solemnised under the happiest auspices, 29th July 1565. Two  days before, Darnley and his father, the Earl of Lennox, had received a  command to return to London, and as they had not obeyed it, a week after  the celebration of the marriage they learned that the Countess of  Lennox, the only one of the family remaining in Elizabeth's power, had  been arrested and taken to the Tower. Thus Elizabeth, in spite of her  dissimulation, yielding to that first impulse of violence that she  always had such trouble to overcome, publicly displayed her resentment.    However, Elizabeth was not the woman to be satisfied with useless  vengeance: she soon released the countess, and turned her eyes towards  Murray, the most discontented of the nobles in opposition, who by this  marriage was losing all his personal influence. It was thus easy for  Elizabeth to put arms in his hand. In fact, when he had failed in his  first attempt to seize Darnley, he called to his aid the Duke of  Chatellerault, Glencairn, Argyll, and Rothes, and collecting what  partisans they could, they openly rebelled against the queen. This was  the first ostensible act of that hatred which was afterwards so fatal to  Mary.    The queen, on her side, appealed to her nobles, who in response hastened  to rally to her, so that in a month's time she found herself at the head  of the finest army that ever a king of Scotland had raised. Darnley  assumed the command of this magnificent assembly, mounted on a superb  horse, arrayed in gilded armour; and accompanied by the queen, who, in a  riding habit, with pistols at her saddle-bow, wished to make the  campaign with him, that she might not quit his side for a moment. Both  were young, both were handsome, and they left Edinburgh amidst the  cheers of the people and the army.    Murray and his accomplices did not even try to stand against them, and  the campaign consisted of such rapid and complex marches and  counter-marches, that this rebellion is called the Run-about Raid-that  is to say, the run in every sense of the word. Murray and the rebels  withdrew into England, where Elizabeth, while seeming to condemn their  unlucky attempt, afforded them all the assistance they needed.    Mary returned to Edinburgh delighted at the success of her two first  campaigns, not suspecting that this new good fortune was the last she  would have, and that there her short-lived prosperity would cease.  Indeed, she soon saw that in Darnley she had given herself not a devoted  and very attentive husband, as she had believed, but an imperious and  brutal master, who, no longer having any motive for concealment, showed  himself to her just as he was, a man of disgraceful vices, of which  drunkenness and debauchery was the least. Accordingly, serious  differences were not long in springing up in this royal household.    Darnley in wedding Mary had not become king, but merely the queen's  husband. To confer on him authority nearly equalling a regent's, it was  necessary that Mary should grant him what was termed the crown  matrimonial--a crown Francis II had worn during his short royalty, and  that Mary, after Darnley's conduct to herself, had not the slightest  intention of bestowing on him. Thus, to whatever entreaties he made, in  whatever form they were wrapped, Mary merely replied with an unvaried  and obstinate refusal. Darnley, amazed at this force of will in a young  queen who had loved him enough to raise him to her, and not believing  that she could find it in herself, sought in her entourage for some  secret and influential adviser who might have inspired her with it. His  suspicions fell on Rizzio.    In reality, to whatever cause Rizzio owed his power (and to even the  most clear-sighted historians this point has always remained obscure),  be it that he ruled as lover, be it that he advised as minister, his  counsels as long as he lived were always given for the greater glory of  the queen. Sprung from so low, he at least wished to show himself  worthy, of having risen so high, and owing everything to Mary, he tried  to repay her with devotion. Thus Darnley was not mistaken, and it was  indeed Rizzio who, in despair at having helped to bring about a union  which he foresaw must become so unfortunate, gave Mary the advice not to  give up any of her power to one who already possessed much more than he  deserved, in possessing her person.    Darnley, like all persons of both weak and violent character,  disbelieved in the persistence of will in others, unless this will was  sustained by an outside influence. He thought that in ridding himself of  Rizzio he could not fail to gain the day, since, as he believed, he  alone was opposing the grant of this great desire of his, the crown  matrimonial. Consequently, as Rizzio was disliked by the nobles in  proportion as his merits had raised him above them, it was easy for  Darnley to organise a conspiracy, and James Douglas of Morton,  chancellor of the kingdom, consented to act as chief.    This is the second time since the beginning of our narrative that we  inscribe this name Douglas, so often pronounced, in Scottish history,  and which at this time, extinct in the elder branch, known as the Black  Douglases, was perpetuated in the younger branch, known as the Red  Douglases. It was an ancient, noble, and powerful family, which, when  the descent in the male line from Robert Bruce had lapsed, disputed the  royal title with the first Stuart, and which since then had constantly  kept alongside the throne, sometimes its support, sometimes its enemy,  envying every great house, for greatness made it uneasy, but above all  envious of the house of Hamilton, which, if not its equal, was at any  rate after itself the next most powerful.    During the whole reign of James V, thanks to the hatred which the king  bore them, the Douglases had not only lost all their influence, but had  also been exiled to England. This hatred was on account of their having  seized the guardianship of the young prince and kept him prisoner till  he was fifteen. Then, with the help of one of his pages, James V had  escaped from Falkland, and had reached Stirling, whose governor was in  his interests. Scarcely was he safe in the castle than he made  proclamation that any Douglas who should approach within a dozen miles  of it would be prosecuted for high treason. This was not all: he  obtained a decree from Parliament, declaring them guilty of felony, and  condemning them to exile; they remained proscribed, then, during the  king's lifetime, and returned to Scotland only upon his death. The  result was that, although they had been recalled about the throne, and  though, thanks to the past influence of Murray, who, one remembers, was  a Douglas on the mother's side, they filled the most important posts  there, they had not forgiven to the daughter the enmity borne them by  the father.    This was why James Douglas, chancellor as he was, and consequently  entrusted with the execution of the laws, put himself at the head of a  conspiracy which had for its aim the violation of all laws; human and  divine.    Douglas's first idea had been to treat Rizzio as the favourites of James  III had been treated at the Bridge of Lauder--that is to say, to make a  show of having a trial and to hang him afterwards. But such a death did  not suffice for Darnley's vengeance; as above everything he wished to  punish the queen in Rizzio's person, he exacted that the murder should  take place in her presence.    Douglas associated with himself Lord Ruthven, an idle and dissolute  sybarite, who under the circumstances promised to push his devotion so  far as to wear a cuirass; then, sure of this important accomplice, he  busied himself with finding other agents.    However, the plot was not woven with such secrecy but that something of  it transpired; and Rizzio received several warnings that he despised.  Sir James Melville, among others, tried every means to make him  understand the perils a stranger ran who enjoyed such absolute  confidence in a wild, jealous court like that of Scotland. Rizzio  received these hints as if resolved not to apply them to himself; and  Sir James Melville, satisfied that he had done enough to ease his  conscience, did not insist further. Then a French priest, who had a  reputation as a clever astrologer, got himself admitted to Rizzio, and  warned him that the stars predicted that he was in deadly peril, and  that he should beware of a certain bastard above all. Rizzio replied  that from the day when he had been honoured with his sovereign's  confidence, he had sacrificed in advance his life to his position; that  since that time, however, he had had occasion to notice that in general  the Scotch were ready to threaten but slow to act; that, as to the  bastard referred to, who was doubtless the Earl of Murray, he would take  care that he should never enter Scotland far enough for his sword to  reach him, were it as long as from Dumfries "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#5)"],[1,"chenschaft' which continued its political and religious  course despite all the jeers of the opposing group--the  'Landmannschaft'. One of his friends called Dittmar and he were pretty  much the chiefs, and although no election had given them their  authority, they exercised so much influence upon what was decided that  in any particular case their fellow-adepts were sure spontaneously to  obey any impulse that they might choose to impart. The meetings of the  Burschen took place upon a little hill crowned by a ruined castle, which  was situated at some distance from Erlangen, and which Sand and Dittmar  had called the Ruttli, in memory of the spot where Walter Furst,  Melchthal, and Stauffacher had made their vow to deliver their country;  there, under the pretence of students' games, while they built up a new  house with the ruined fragments, they passed alternately from symbol to  action and from action to symbol.    Meanwhile the association was making such advances throughout Germany  that not only the princes and kings of the German confederation, but  also the great European powers, began to be uneasy. France sent agents  to bring home reports, Russia paid agents on the spot, and the  persecutions that touched a professor and exasperated a whole university  often arose from a note sent by the Cabinet of the Tuileries or of St.  Petersburg.    It was amid the events that began thus that Sand, after commending  himself to the protection of God, began the year 1817, in the sad mood  in which we have just seen him, and in which he was kept rather by a  disgust for things as they were than by a disgust for life. On the 8th  of May, preyed upon by this melancholy, which he cannot conquer, and  which comes from the disappointment of all his political hopes, he  writes in his diary:    \"I shall find it impassible to set seriously to work, and this idle  temper, this humour of hypochondria which casts its black veil over  everything in life,--continues and grows in spite of the moral activity  which I imposed on myself yesterday.\"    In the holidays, fearing to burden his parents with any additional  expense, he will not go home, and prefers to make a walking tour with  his friends. No doubt this tour, in addition to its recreative side, had  a political aim. Be that as it may, Sand's diary, during the period of  his journey, shows nothing but the names of the towns through which he  passed. That we may have a notion of Sand's dutifulness to his parents,  it should be said that he did not set out until he had obtained his  mother's permission. On their return, Sand, Dittmar, and their friends  the Burschen, found their Ruttli sacked by their enemies of the  Landmannschaft; the house that they had built was demolished and its  fragments dispersed. Sand took this event for an omen, and was greatly  depressed by it.    \"It seems to me, O my God!\" he says in his journal, \"that everything  swims and turns around me. My soul grows darker and darker; my moral  strength grows less instead of greater; I work and cannot achieve; walk  towards my aim and do not reach it; exhaust myself, and do nothing  great. The days of life flee one after another; cares and uneasiness  increase; I see no haven anywhere for our sacred German cause. The end  will be that we shall fall, for I myself waver. O Lord and Father!  protect me, save me, and lead me to that land from which we are for ever  driven back by the indifference of wavering spirits.\"    About this time a terrible event struck Sand to the heart; his friend  Dittmar was drowned. This is what he wrote in his diary on the very  morning of the occurrence:    \"Oh, almighty God! What is going to become of me? For the last fortnight  I have been drawn into disorder, and have not been able to compel myself  to look fixedly either backward or forward in my life, so that from the  4th of June up to the present hour my journal has remained empty. Yet  every day I might have had occasion to praise Thee, O my God, but my  soul is in anguish. Lord, do not turn from me; the more are the  obstacles the more need is there of strength.\"    In the evening he added these few words to the lines that he had written  in the morning:--    \"Desolation, despair, and death over my friend, over my very deeply  loved Dittmar.\"    This letter which he wrote to his family contains the account of the  tragic event:--    \"You know that when my best friends, A., C., and Z., were gone, I became  particularly intimate with my well-beloved Dittmar of Anspach; Dittmar,  that is to say a true and worthy German, an evangelical Christian,  something more, in short, than a man! An angelic soul, always turned  toward the good, serene, pious, and ready for action; he had come to  live in a room next to mine in Professor Grunler's house; we loved each  other, upheld each other in our efforts, and, well or ill, bare our good  or evil fortune in common. On this last spring evening, after having  worked in his room and having strengthened ourselves anew to resist all  the torments of life and to advance towards the aim that we desired to  attain; we went, about seven in the evening, to the baths of Redwitz. A  very black storm was rising in the sky, but only as yet appeared on the  horizon. E., who was with us, proposed to go home, but Dittmar  persisted, saying that the canal was but a few steps away. God permitted  that it should not be I who replied with these fatal words. So he went  on. The sunset was splendid: I see it still; its violet clouds all  fringed with gold, for I remember the smallest details of that evening.    \"Dittmar went down first; he was the only one of us who knew how to  swim; so he walked before us to show us the depth. The water was about  up to our chests, and he, who preceded us, was up to his shoulders, when  he warned us not to go farther, because he was ceasing to feel the  bottom. He immediately gave up his footing and began to swim, but  scarcely had he made ten strokes when, having reached the place where  the river separates into two branches, he uttered a cry, and as he was  trying to get a foothold, disappeared. We ran at once to the bank,  hoping to be able to help him more easily; but we had neither poles nor  ropes within reach, and, as I have told you, neither of us could swim.  Then we called for help with all our might. At that moment Dittmar  reappeared, and by an unheard-of effort seized the end of a willow  branch that was hanging over the water; but the branch was not strong  enough to resist, and our friend sank again, as though he had been  struck by apoplexy. Can you imagine the state in which we were, we his  friends, bending over the river, our fixed and haggard eyes trying to  pierce its depth? My God, my God! how was it we did not go mad?    \"A great crowd, however, had run at our cries. For two hours they sought  far him with boats and drag-hooks; and at last they succeeded in drawing  his body from the gulf. Yesterday we bore it solemnly to the field of  rest.    \"Thus with the end of this spring has begun the serious summer of my  life. I greeted it in a grave and melancholy mood, and you behold me  now, if not consoled, at least strengthened by religion, which, thanks  to the merits of Christ, gives me the assurance of meeting my friend in  heaven, from the heights of which he will inspire me with strength to  support the trials of this life; and now I do not desire anything more  except to know you free from all anxiety in regard to me.\"    Instead of serving to unite the two groups of students in a common  grief, this accident, on the contrary, did but intensify their hatred of  each other. Among the first persons who ran up at the cries of Sand and  his companion was a member of the Landmannschaft who could swim, but  instead of going to Dittmar's assistance he exclaimed, \"It seems that we  shall get rid of one of these dogs of Burschen; thank God!\"  Notwithstanding this manifestation of hatred, which, indeed, might be  that of an individual and not of the whole body, the Burschen invited  their enemies to be present at Dittmar's funeral. A brutal refusal, and  a threat to disturb the ceremony by insults to the corpse, formed their  sole reply. The Burschen then warned the authorities, who took suitable  measures, and all Dittmar's friends followed his coffin sword in hand.  Beholding this calm but resolute demonstration, the Landmannschaft did  not dare to carry out their threat, and contented themselves with  insulting the procession by laughs and songs.    Sand wrote in his journal:    \"Dittmar is a great loss to all of us, and particularly to me; he gave  me the overflow of his strength and life; he stopped, as it were, with  an embankment, the part of my character that is irresolute and  undecided. From him it is that I have learned not to dread the  approaching storm, and to know how to fight and die.\"    Some days after the funeral Sand had a quarrel about Dittmar with one of  his former friends, who had passed over from the Burschen to the  Landmannschaft, and who had made himself conspicuous at the time of the  funeral by his indecent hilarity. It was decided that they should fight  the next day, and on the same day Sand wrote in his journal.    \"To-morrow I am to fight with P. G.; yet Thou knowest, O my God, what  great friends we formerly were, except for a certain mistrust with which  his coldness always inspired me; but on this occasion his odious conduct  has caused me to descend from the tenderest pity to the profoundest  hatred.    \"My God, do not withdraw Thy hand either from him or from me, since we  are both fighting like men! Judge only by our two causes, and give the  victory to that which is the more just. If Thou shouldst call me before  Thy supreme tribunal, I know very well that I should appear burdened  with an eternal malediction; and indeed it is not upon myself that I  reckon but upon the merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ.    \"Co"]]]
