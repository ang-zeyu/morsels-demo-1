The soldiers followed them. The Sun was up and  the sky was turning blue. The air smelled sweet and good, the smell of  growing things.    Taylor removed his helmet and took a deep breath.    \"I haven't smelled that smell for a long time,\" he said.    \"Listen,\" Franks said, his voice low and hard. \"We must get back down at  once. There's a lot to get started on. All this can be turned to our  advantage.\"    \"What do you mean?\" Moss asked.    \"It's a certainty that the Soviets have been tricked, too, the same as  us. But _we_ have found out. That gives us an edge over them.\"    \"I see.\" Moss nodded. \"We know, but they don't. Their Surface Council  has sold out, the same as ours. It works against them the same way. But  if we could--\"    \"With a hundred top-level men, we could take over again, restore things  as they should be! It would be easy!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Moss touched him on the arm. An A-class leady was coming from the  building toward them.    \"We've seen enough,\" Franks said, raising his voice. \"All this is very  serious. It must be reported below and a study made to determine our  policy.\"    The leady said nothing.    Franks waved to the soldiers. \"Let's go.\" He started toward the  warehouse.    Most of the soldiers had removed their helmets. Some of them had taken  their lead suits off, too, and were relaxing comfortably in their cotton  uniforms. They stared around them, down the hillside at the trees and  bushes, the vast expanse of green, the mountains and the sky.    \"Look at the Sun,\" one of them murmured.    \"It sure is bright as hell,\" another said.    \"We're going back down,\" Franks said. \"Fall in by twos and follow us.\"    Reluctantly, the soldiers regrouped. The leadys watched without emotion  as the men marched slowly back toward the warehouse. Franks and Moss and  Taylor led them across the ground, glancing alertly at the leadys as  they walked.    They entered the warehouse. D-class leadys were loading material and  weapons on surface carts. Cranes and derricks were working busily  everywhere. The work was done with efficiency, but without hurry or  excitement.    The men stopped, watching. Leadys operating the little carts moved past  them, signaling silently to each other. Guns and parts were being  hoisted by magnetic cranes and lowered gently onto waiting carts.    \"Come on,\" Franks said.    He turned toward the lip of the Tube. A row of D-class leadys was  standing in front of it, immobile and silent. Franks stopped, moving  back. He looked around. An A-class leady was coming toward him.    \"Tell them to get out of the way,\" Franks said. He touched his gun. \"You  had better move them.\"    Time passed, an endless moment, without measure. The men stood, nervous  and alert, watching the row of leadys in front of them.    \"As you wish,\" the A-class leady said.    It signaled and the D-class leadys moved into life. They stepped slowly  aside.    Moss breathed a sigh of relief.    \"I'm glad that's over,\" he said to Franks. \"Look at them all. Why don't  they try to stop us? They must know what we're going to do.\"    Franks laughed. \"Stop us? You saw what happened when they tried to stop  us before. They can't; they're only machines. We built them so they  can't lay hands on us, and they know that.\"    His voice trailed off.    The men stared at the Tube entrance. Around them the leadys watched,  silent and impassive, their metal faces expressionless.    For a long time the men stood without moving. At last Taylor turned  away.    \"Good God,\" he said. He was numb, without feeling of any kind.    The Tube was gone. It was sealed shut, fused over. Only a dull surface  of cooling metal greeted them.    The Tube had been closed.           *       *       *       *       *    Franks turned, his face pale and vacant.    The A-class leady shifted. \"As you can see, the Tube has been shut. We  were prepared for this. As soon as all of you were on the surface, the  order was given. If you had gone back when we asked you, you would now  be safely down below. We had to work quickly because it was such an  immense operation.\"    \"But why?\" Moss demanded angrily.    \"Because it is unthinkable that you should be allowed to resume the war.  With all the Tubes sealed, it will be many months before forces from  below can reach the surface, let alone organize a military program. By  that time the cycle will have entered its last stages. You will not be  so perturbed to find your world intact.    \"We had hoped that you would be undersurface when the sealing occurred.  Your presence here is a nuisance. When the Soviets broke through, we  were able to accomplish their sealing without--\"    \"The Soviets? They broke through?\"    \"Several months ago, they came up unexpectedly to see why the war had  not been won. We were forced to act with speed. At this moment they are  desperately attempting to cut new Tubes to the surface, to resume the  war. We have, however, been able to seal each new one as it appears.\"    The leady regarded the three men calmly.    \"We're cut off,\" Moss said, trembling. \"We can't get back. What'll we  do?\"    \"How did you manage to seal the Tube so quickly?\" Franks asked the  leady. \"We've been up here only two hours.\"    \"Bombs are placed just above the first stage of each Tube for such  emergencies. They are heat bombs. They fuse lead and rock.\"    Gripping the handle of his gun, Franks turned to Moss and Taylor.    \"What do you say? We can't go back, but we can do a lot of damage, the  fifteen of us. We have Bender guns. How about it?\"    He looked around. The soldiers had wandered away again, back toward the  exit of the building. They were standing outside, looking at the valley  and the sky. A few of them were carefully climbing down the slope.    \"Would you care to turn over your suits and guns?\" the A-class leady  asked politely. \"The suits are uncomfortable and you'll have no need for  weapons. The Russians have given up theirs, as you can see.\"    Fingers tensed on triggers. Four men in Russian uniforms were coming  toward them from an aircraft that they suddenly realized had landed  silently some distance away.    \"Let them have it!\" Franks shouted.    \"They are unarmed,\" said the leady. \"We brought them here so you could  begin peace talks.\"    \"We have no authority to speak for our country,\" Moss said stiffly.    \"We do not mean diplomatic discussions,\" the leady explained. \"There  will be no more. The working out of daily problems of existence will  teach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but  it will be done.\"    [Illustration]           *       *       *       *       *    The Russians halted and they faced each other with raw hostility.    \"I am Colonel Borodoy and I regret giving up our guns,\" the senior  Russian said. \"You could have been the first Americans to be killed in  almost eight years.\"    \"Or the first Americans to kill,\" Franks corrected.    \"No one would know of it except yourselves,\" the leady pointed out. \"It  would be useless heroism. Your real concern should be surviving on the  surface. We have no food for you, you know.\"    Taylor put his gun in its holster. \"They've done a neat job of  neutralizing us, damn them. I propose we move into a city, start raising  crops with the help of some leadys, and generally make ourselves  comfortable.\" Drawing his lips tight over his teeth, he glared at the  A-class leady. \"Until our families can come up from undersurface, it's  going to be pretty lonesome, but we'll have to manage.\"    \"If I may make a suggestion,\" said another Russian uneasily. \"We tried  living in a city. It is too empty. It is also too hard to maintain for  so few people. We finally settled in the most modern village we could  find.\"    \"Here in this country,\" a third Russian blurted. \"We have much to learn  from you.\"    The Americans abruptly found themselves laughing.    \"You probably have a thing or two to teach us yourselves,\" said Taylor  generously, \"though I can't imagine what.\"    The Russian colonel grinned. \"Would you join us in our village? It would  make our work easier and give us company.\"    \"Your village?\" snapped Franks. \"It's American, isn't it? It's ours!\"    The leady stepped between them. \"When our plans are completed, the term  will be interchangeable. 'Ours' will eventually mean mankind's.\" It  pointed at the aircraft, which was warming up. \"The ship is waiting.  Will you join each other in making a new home?\"    The Russians waited while the Americans made up their minds.    \"I see what the leadys mean about diplomacy becoming outmoded,\" Franks  said at last. \"People who work together don't need diplomats. They solve  their problems on the operational level instead of at a conference  table.\"    The leady led them toward the ship. \"It is the goal of history, unifying  the world. From family to tribe to city-state to nation to hemisphere,  the direction has been toward unification. Now the hemispheres will be  joined and--\"    Taylor stopped listening and glanced back at the location of the Tube.  Mary was undersurface there. He hated to leave her, even though he  couldn't see her again until the Tube was unsealed. But then he shrugged  and followed the others.    If this tiny amalgam of former enemies was a good example, it wouldn't  be too long before he and Mary and the rest of humanity would be living  on the surface like rational human beings instead of blindly hating  moles.    \"It has taken thousands of generations to achieve,\" the A-class leady  concluded. \"Hundreds of centuries of bloodshed and destruction. But each  war was a step toward uniting mankind. And now the end is in sight: a  world without war. But even that is only the beginning of a new stage of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2882"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 4 (#5)"],[1," a vision.  He prophesied that this world would continue to exist only seven  thousand years, to be followed then by the Kingdom of Heaven.  These words spoken, the prophetical spirit departed from him, and  he straightway forgot what he had uttered during his vision. Before  he passed away, he spoke once more, saying: \"If such be the rest  which the righteous obtain after their death, it were better for them  to die than live in this corrupt world and see its iniquities.\" (20)    As Kenaz left no male heirs, Zebul was appointed his successor.  Mindful of the great service Kenaz had performed for the nation,  Zebul acted a father's part toward the three unmarried daughters of  his predecessor. At his instance, the people assigned a rich  marriage portion to each of them; they were given great domains  as their property. The oldest of the three, Ethema by name, he  married to Elizaphan; the second, Pheila, to Odihel; and the  youngest, Zilpah, to Doel.    Zebul, the judge, instituted a treasury at Shiloh. He bade the  people bring contributions, whether of gold or of silver. They were  only to take heed not to carry anything thither that had originally  belonged to an idol. His efforts were crowned with success. The  free-will offerings to the temple treasure amounted to twenty  talents of gold and two hundred and fifty talents of silver.    Zebul's reign lasted twenty-five years. Before his death he  admonished the people solemnly to be God-fearing and observant  of the law. (21)     OTHNIEL    Othniel was a judge of a very different type. His contemporaries  said, that before the sun of Joshua went down, the sun of Othniel,  his successor in the leadership of the people , appeared on the  horizon. The new leader's real name was Judah; Othniel was one  of his epithets, as Jabez was another. (22)    Among the judges, Othniel represents the class of scholars. His  acumen was so great that he was able, by dint of dialect reasoning,  to restore the seventeen hundred traditions (23) which Moses had  taught the people, and which had been forgotten in the time of  mourning for Moses. Nor was his zeal for the promotion of the  study of the Torah inferior to his learning. The descendants of  Jethro left Jericho, the district assigned to them, and journeyed to  Arad, only that thy might sit at the feed to Othniel. (24) His wife,  the daughter of his half-brother Caleb, was not so well pleased  with him. She complained to her father that her husband's house  was bare of all earthly goods, and his only possession was  knowledge of the Torah. (25)    The first event to be noted in Othniel's forty years' reign (26) is his  victory over Adoni-bezek. This chief did not occupy a prominent  position among the Canaanitish rulers. He was not even accounted  a king, nevertheless he had conquered seventy foreign kings. (27)  The next event was the capture of Luz by the Israelites. The only  way to gain entrance into Luz was by a cave, and the road to the  cave lay through a hollow almond tree. If the secret approach to  the city had not been betrayed by one of its residents, it would  have been impossible for the Israelites to reach it. God rewarded  the informer who put the Israelites in the way of capturing Luz.  The city he founded was left unmolested both by Sennacherib and  Nebuchadnezzar, and not event the Angel of Death has power over  its inhabitants. They never die, unless, weary of life, they leave the  city. (28)    The same good fortune did not mark Othniel's reign throughout.  For eight years Israel suffered oppression at the hands of Cushan,  the evil-doer who in former days had threatened to destroy the  patriarch Jacob, as he was now endeavoring to destroy the  descendants of Jacob, for Cushan is only another name for Laban.  (29)    Othniel, however, was held so little answerable for the causes that  had brought on the punishment of the people, that God granted  him eternal life; he is one of the few who reached Paradise alive.  (30)     BOAZ AND RUTH    The story of Ruth came to pass a hundred (31) years after Othniel's  reign. Conditions in Palestine were of such a nature that if a judge  said to a man, \"Remove the mote from thine eye,\" his reply was,  \"Do thou remove the beam from thine own.\" (32) To chastise the  Israelites God sent down them one of the ten seasons of famine  which He had ordained, as disciplinary measures for mankind,  from the creation of the world until the advent of Messiah. (33)  Elimelech (34) and his sons, (35) who belonged to the aristocracy  of the land, attempted neither to improve (36) the sinful generation  whose transgressions had called forth the famine, nor alleviated  the distress that prevailed about them. They left Palestine, and thus  withdrew themselves from the needy who had counted upon their  help. They turned their faced to Moab. (37) There, on account of  their wealth and high descent, they were made officers in the army.  (38) Mahlon and Chilion, the sons of Elimelech, rose to still higher  distinction, they married the daughters of the Moabite king Eglon  (39) But this did not happen until after the death of Elimelech,  who was opposed to intermarriage with the heathen. (40) Neither  the wealth nor the family connections of the two men helped them  before God. First they sank into poverty, and, as they continued in  their sinful ways, God took their life. (41)    Naomi, their mother, resolved to return to her home. Her two  daughters-in-law were very dear to her on account of the love they  had borne her sons, a love strong even in death, for they refused to  marry again. (42) Yet she would not take them with her to  Palestine, because she foresaw contemptuous treatment in store for  them as Moabitish women. (43) Orpah was easily persuaded to  remain behind. She accompanied her mother-in-law a distance of  four miles, and then she took leave of her, shedding only four tears  as she bade her farewell. Subsequent events showed that she had  not been worthy of entering into the Jewish communion, for  scarcely had she separated from Naomi when she abandoned  herself to an immoral life. But with God nothing goes unrewarded.  For the four miles which Orpah travelled with Naomi, she was  recompensed by bringing forth four giants, Goliath and his three  brothers. (44)    Ruth's bearing and history were far different. She was determined  to become a Jewess, and her decision could not be shaken by what  Naomi, in compliance with the Jewish injunction, told her of the  difficulties of the Jewish law. Naomi warned her that the Israelites  had been enjoined to keep Sabbaths and feast days, (45) and that  the daughters of Israel were not in the habit of frequenting the  threatres and circuses of the heathen. Ruth only affirmed her  readiness to follow Jewish customs. (46) And when Naomi said:  \"We have one Torah, one law, one command; the Eternal our God  is one, there is none beside Him,\" Ruth answered: \"Thy people  shall be my people, thy God my God.\" (47) So the two women  journeyed together to Bethlehem. They arrived there on the very  day on which the wife of Boaz was buried, and the concourse  assembled for the funeral saw Naomi as she returned to her home.  (48)    Ruth supported herself and her mother-in-law sparsely with the  ears of grain which she gathered in the fields. Association with so  pious a woman as Naomi (49) had already exercised great  influence upon her life and ways. Boaz was astonished to notice  that if the reapers let more than two ears fall, in spite of her need  she did not pick them up, for the gleaning assigned to the poor by  law does not refer to quantities of more than two ears inadvertently  dropped at one time. (50) Boaz also admired her grace, her  decorous conduct, her modest demeanor. (51) When he learned  who she was, he commended her for her attachment to Judaism.  To his praise she returned: \"Thy ancestors found no delight even in  Timna, (52) the daughter of a royal house. As for me, I am a  member of a low people, abominated by thy God, and excluded  from the assembly of Israel.\" For the moment Boaz failed to  recollect the Halakah bearing on the Moabites and Ammonites. A  voice from heaven reminded him that only their males were  affected by the command of exclusion. (53) This he told to Ruth,  and he also told her of a vision he had had concerning her  descendants. For the sake of the good she had done to her  mother-in-law, kings and prophets would spring from her womb.  (54)    Boaz showed kindness not only to Ruth and Naomi, but also to  their dead. He took upon himself the decent burial of the remains  of Elimelech and his two sons. (55) All this begot in Naomi the  thought that Boaz harbored the intention of marrying Ruth. She  sought to coax the secret, if such there was, from Ruth. (56) When  she found that nothing could be elicited from her daughter-in-law,  she made Ruth her partner in a plan to force Boaz into a decisive  step. Ruth adhered to Naomi's directions in every particular,  except that she did not wash and anoint herself and put on fine  raiment, until after she had reached her destination. She feared to  attract the attention of the lustful, if she walked along the road  decked out in unusual finery. (57)    The moral conditions in those days were very reprehensible.  Though Boaz was high-born and a man of substance, yet he slept  on the threshing-floor, so that his presence might act as a check  upon profligacy. In the midst of his sleep, Boaz was startled to find  some one next to him. At first he thought it was a demon. Ruth  calmed his disquietude (58) with these words: \"Thou art the head  of the court, thy ancestors were princes, thou art thyself an  honorable man, and a kinsman of my dead husband. As for me,  who am in the flower of my years, since I left the home of my  parents where homage is rendered unto idols, I have been  constantly menaced by the dissolute young men around. (59) So I  have come"]]]
