[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#5)"],[1,"the position of the planets in the various houses at  some epoch guided the astrologer's opinion as to the fortune of that  hour, either in the life of a man or the career of a State. In such  inquiries, however, not only the position of the planets, etc., at the  time had to be considered, but also the original horoscope of the  person, or the special planets and signs associated with particular  States. Thus if Jupiter, the most fortunate of all the planets, was in  the ascendant, or in the House of Honour, at the time of the native's  birth, and at some epoch this planet was ill-aspected or afflicted by  other planets potent for evil in the native's horoscope, then that epoch  would be a threatening one in the native's career.    The sign Gemini was regarded by astrologers as especially associated  with the fortunes of London, and accordingly they tell us that the great  fire of London, the plague, the building of London Bridge, and other  events interesting to London, all occurred when this sign was in the  ascendant, or when special planets were in this sign.[7]    The signs of the zodiac in the various houses were in the first place  to be noted, because not only had these signs special powers in special  houses, but the effects of the planets in particular houses varied  according to the signs in which the planets were situated. If we were to  follow the description given by the astrologers themselves, not much  insight would be thrown upon the meaning of the zodiacal signs. For  instance, astrologers say that Aries is a vernal, dry, fiery, masculine,  cardinal, equinoctial, diurnal, movable, commanding, eastern, choleric,  violent, and quadrupedalian sign. We may, however, infer generally from  their accounts the influences which they assigned to the zodiacal signs.    Aries is the house and joy of Mars, signifies a dry constitution, long  face and neck, thick shoulders, swarthy complexion, and a hasty,  passionate temper. It governs the head and face, and all diseases  relating thereto. It reigns over England, France, Switzerland, Germany,  Denmark, Lesser Poland, Syria, Naples, Capua, Verona, etc. It is a  masculine sign, and is regarded as fortunate.    Taurus gives to the native born under his auspices a stout athletic  frame, broad bull-like forehead, dark curly hair, short neck, and so  forth, and a dull apathetic temper, exceedingly cruel and malicious if  once aroused. It governs the neck and throat, and reigns over Ireland,  Great Poland, part of Russia, Holland, Persia, Asia Minor, the  Archipelago, Mantua, Leipsic, etc. It is a feminine sign, and  unfortunate.    Gemini is the house of Mercury. The native of Gemini will have a  sanguine complexion and tall, straight figure, dark eyes quick and  piercing, brown hair, active ways, and will be of exceedingly ingenious  intellect. It governs the arms and shoulders, and rules over the  south-west parts of England, America, Flanders, Lombardy, Sardinia,  Armenia, Lower Egypt, London, Versailles, Brabant, etc. It is a  masculine sign, and fortunate.    Cancer is the house of the Moon and exaltation of Jupiter, and its  native will be of fair but pale complexion, round face, grey or mild  blue eyes, weak voice, the upper part of the body large, slender arms,  small feet, and an effeminate constitution. It governs the breast and  the stomach, and reigns over Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Burgundy,  Africa, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Constantinople, New York, etc. It is a  feminine sign, and unfortunate.    The native born under Leo will be of large body, broad shoulders,  austere countenance, with dark eyes and tawny hair, strong voice, and  leonine character, resolute and ambitious, but generous, free, and  courteous. Leo governs the heart and back, and reigns over Italy,  Bohemia, France, Sicily, Rome, Bristol, Bath, Taunton, Philadelphia,  etc. It is a masculine sign, and fortunate.    Virgo is the joy of Mercury. Its natives are of moderate stature, seldom  handsome, slender but compact, thrifty and ingenious. It governs the  abdomen, and reigns over Turkey both in Europe and Asia, Greece, and  Mesopotamia, Crete, Jerusalem, Paris, Lyons, etc. It is a feminine sign,  and generally unfortunate.    Libra is the house of Venus. The natives of Libra are tall and well  made, elegant in person, round-faced and ruddy, but plain-featured and  'inclined to eruptions that disfigure the face when old; they' (the  natives) 'are of sweet disposition, just and upright in dealing.' It  governs the lumbar regions, and reigns over Austria, Alsace, Savoy,  Portugal, Livonia, India, Ethiopia, Lisbon, Vienna, Frankfort, Antwerp,  Charleston, etc. It is a masculine sign, and fortunate.    Scorpio is, like Aries, the house of Mars, 'and also his joy.' Its  natives are strong, corpulent, and robust, with large bones, 'dark curly  hair and eyes' (presumably the eyes dark only, not curly), middle  stature, dusky complexion, active bodies; they are usually reserved in  speech. It governs the region of the groin, and reigns over Judaea,  Mauritania, Catalonia, Norway, West Silesia, Upper Batavia, Barbary,  Morocco, Valentia, Messina, etc. It is feminine, and unfortunate. (It  would appear likely, by the way, that astrology was a purely masculine  science.)    Sagittarius is the house and joy of Jupiter. Its natives are well formed  and tall, ruddy, handsome, and jovial, with fine clear eyes, chestnut  hair, and oval fleshy face. They are 'generally jolly fellows at either  bin or board,' active, intrepid, generous, and obliging. It governs the  legs and thighs,[8] and reigns over Arabia Felix, Spain, Hungary,  Moravia, Liguria, Narbonne, Cologne, Avignon, etc. It is masculine, and  of course fortunate.    Capricorn is the house of Saturn and exaltation of Mars. This sign gives  to its natives a dry constitution and slender make, with a long thin  visage, thin beard (a generally goaty aspect, in fact), dark hair, long  neck, narrow chin, and weak knees. It governs, nevertheless, the knees  and hams, and reigns over India, Macedonia, Thrace and Greece, Mexico,  Saxony, Wilna, Mecklenburgh, Brandenburg, and Oxford. It is feminine,  and unfortunate.    Aquarius also is the house of Saturn. Its natives are robust, steady,  strong, healthy, and of middle stature; delicate complexion, clear but  not pale, sandy hair, hazel eyes, and generally an honest disposition.  It governs the legs and ankles, and reigns over Arabia, Petraea, Tartary,  Russia, Denmark, Lower Sweden, Westphalia, Hamburg, and Bremen. It is  masculine, and fortunate.    Pisces is the house of Jupiter and exaltation of Venus. Its natives are  short, pale, thick-set, and round-shouldered (like fish), its character  phlegmatic and effeminate. It governs the feet and toes, and reigns over  Portugal, Spain, Egypt, Normandy, Galicia, Ratisbon, Calabria, etc. It  is feminine, and therefore, naturally, unfortunate.    Let us next consider the influences assigned to the various planets and  constellations.    Though we can understand that in old times the planets and stars were  regarded as exercising very potent influences upon the fates of men and  nations,[9] it is by no means easy to understand how astrologers came to  assign to each planet its special influence. That is, it is not easy to  understand how they could have been led to such a result by actual  reasoning, still less by any process of observation.[10] There was a  certain scientific basis for the belief in the possibility of  determining the special influences of the stars; and we should have  expected to find some scientific process adopted for the purpose. Yet,  so far as can be judged, the influences assigned to the planets depended  on entirely fanciful considerations. In some cases we seem almost to see  the line along which the fancies of the old astrologers led them, just  as in some cases we can perceive how mythological superstitions (which  are closely related to astrological ideas) had their origin; though it  is not quite clear whether the planets were first regarded as deities  with special qualities, and these qualities afterwards assigned to the  planetary influences, or whether the planetary influences were first  assigned, and came eventually to be regarded as the qualities of the  deities associated with the several planets.    It is easy, for instance, to understand why astrologers should have  regarded the sun as the emblem of kingly power and dignity, and equally  easy to understand why, to the sun regarded as a deity, corresponding  qualities should have been ascribed; but it is not easy to determine  whether the astrological or the Sabaistic superstitions were the  earlier. And in like manner of the moon and planets. There seems to me  no sufficient evidence in favour of Whewell's opinion, that 'in whatever  manner the sun, moon, and planets came to be identified with gods and  goddesses, the characters ascribed to these gods and goddesses,  regulated the virtues and powers of the stars which bear their names.'  As he himself very justly remarks, 'We do not possess any of the  speculations of the earlier astrologers; and we cannot, therefore, be  certain that the notions which operated in men's minds when the art had  its birth, agreed with the views on which it was afterwards defended.'  He does not say why he infers that, though at later periods supported by  physical analogies, it was originally suggested by mythological beliefs.  Quite as probably mythological beliefs were suggested by astrological  notions. Some of these beliefs, indeed, seem manifestly to have been so  suggested; as the character of the deity Mercury, from the rapid motions  of the planet Mercury, and the difficulty of detecting it; the character  of Mars from the blood-red hue of the planet when close to the horizon,  and so forth.    Let us examine, however, the characteristics ascribed by astrologers to  various planets.
