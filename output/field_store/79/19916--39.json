When these reports were mentioned to Mignon, he, instead of denying  their truth, cast up his eyes to heaven and said that God was certainly  a great and merciful God, but it was also certain that Satan was very  clever, especially when he was barked by that false human science called  magic. However, as to the reports, though they were not entirely without  foundation, he would not go so far as to say that any of the sisters  were really possessed by devils, that being a question which time alone  could decide.    The effect of such an answer on minds already prepared to listen to the  most impossible things, may easily be guessed. Mignon let the gossip go  its rounds for several months without giving it any fresh food, but at  length, when the time was ripe, he called on the priest of Saint-Jacques  at Chinon, and told him that matters had now come to such a pass in the  Ursuline convent that he felt it impossible to bear up alone under the  responsibility of caring for the salvation of the afflicted nuns, and he  begged him to accompany him to the convent. This priest, whose name was  Pierre Barre, was exactly the man whom Mignon needed in such a crisis.  He was of melancholy temperament, and dreamed dreams and saw visions;  his one ambition was to gain a reputation for asceticism and holiness.  Desiring to surround his visit with the solemnity befitting such an  important event, he set out for Loudun at the head of all his  parishioners, the whole procession going on foot, in order to arouse  interest and curiosity; but this measure was quite needless it took less  than that to set the town agog.    While the faithful filled the churches offering up prayers for the  success of the exorcisms, Mignon and Barre entered upon their task at  the convent, where they remained shut up with the nuns for six hours. At  the end of this time Barre appeared and announced to his parishioners  that they might go back to Chinon without him, for he had made up his  mind to remain for the present at Loudun, in order to aid the venerable  director of the Ursuline convent in the holy work he had undertaken; he  enjoined on them to pray morning and evening, with all possible fervour,  that, in spite of the serious dangers by which it was surrounded, the  good cause might finally triumph. This advice, unaccompanied as it was  by any explanation, redoubled the curiosity of the people, and the  belief gained ground that it was not merely one or two nuns who were  possessed of devils, but the whole sisterhood. It was not very long  before the name of the magician who had worked this wonder began to be  mentioned quite openly: Satan, it was said, had drawn Urbain Grandier  into his power, through his pride. Urbain had entered into a pact with  the Evil Spirit by which he had sold him his soul in return for being  made the most learned man on earth. Now, as Urbain's knowledge was much  greater than that of the inhabitants of Loudun, this story gained  general credence in the town, although here and there was to be found a  man sufficiently enlightened to shrug his shoulders at these  absurdities, and to laugh at the mummeries, of which as yet he saw only  the ridiculous side.    For the next ten or twelve days Mignon and Barre spent the greater part  of their time at the convent; sometimes remaining there for six hours at  a stretch, sometimes the entire day. At length, on Monday, the 11th of  October, 1632, they wrote to the priest of Venier, to Messire Guillaume  Cerisay de la Gueriniere, bailiff of the Loudenois, and to Messire Louis  Chauvet, civil lieutenant, begging them to visit the Ursuline convent,  in order to examine two nuns who were possessed by evil spirits, and to  verify the strange and almost incredible manifestations of this  possession. Being thus formally appealed to, the two magistrates could  not avoid compliance with the request. It must be confessed that they  were not free from curiosity, and felt far from sorry at being able to  get to the bottom of the mystery of which for some time the whole town  was talking. They repaired, therefore, to the convent, intending to make  a thorough investigation as to the reality of the possession and as to  the efficacy of the exorcisms employed. Should they judge that the nuns  were really possessed, and that those who tried to deliver them were in  earnest, they would authorise the continuation of the efforts at  exorcism; but if they were not satisfied on these two points, they would  soon put an end to the whole thing as a comedy. When they reached the  door, Mignon, wearing alb and stole, came to meet them. He told them  that the feelings of the nuns had for more than two weeks been harrowed  by the apparition of spectres and other blood-curdling visions, that the  mother superior and two nuns had evidently been possessed by evil  spirits for over a week; that owing to the efforts of Barre and same  Carmelite friars who were good enough to assist him against their common  enemies, the devils had been temporarily driven out, but on the previous  Sunday night, the 10th of October, the mother superior, Jeanne de  Belfield, whose conventual name was Jeanne des Anges, and a lay sister  called Jeanne Dumagnoux, had again been entered into by the same  spirits. It had, however, been discovered by means of exorcisms that a  new compact, of which the symbol and token was a bunch of roses, had  been concluded, the symbol and token of the first having been three  black thorns. He added that during the time of the first possession the  demons had refused to give their names, but by the power of his  exorcisms this reluctance had been overcome, the spirit which had  resumed possession of the mother superior having at length revealed that  its name was Ashtaroth, one of the greatest enemies of God, while the  devil which had entered into the lay sister was of a lower order, and  was called Sabulon. Unfortunately, continued Mignon, just now the two  afflicted nuns were resting, and he requested the bailiff and the civil  lieutenant to put off their inspection till a little later. The two  magistrates were just about to go away, when a nun appeared, saying that  the devils were again doing their worst with the two into whom they had  entered. Consequently, they accompanied Mignon and the priest from  Venier to an upper room, in which were seven narrow beds, of which two  only were occupied, one by the mother superior and the other by the lay  sister. The superior, who was the more thoroughly possessed of the two,  was surrounded by the Carmelite monks, the sisters belonging to the  convent, Mathurin Rousseau, priest and canon of Sainte-Croix, and  Mannouri, a surgeon from the town.    No sooner did the two magistrates join the others than the superior was  seized with violent convulsions, writhing and uttering squeals in exact  imitation of a sucking pig. The two magistrates looked on in profound  astonishment, which was greatly increased when they saw the patient now  bury herself in her bed, now spring right out of it, the whole  performance being accompanied by such diabolical gestures and grimaces  that, if they were not quite convinced that the possession was genuine,  they were at least filled with admiration of the manner in which it was  simulated. Mignon next informed the bailiff and the civil lieutenant,  that although the superior had never learned Latin she would reply in  that language to all the questions addressed to her, if such were their  desire. The magistrates answered that as they were there in order to  examine thoroughly into the facts of the case, they begged the exorcists  to give them every possible proof that the possession was real. Upon  this, Mignon approached the mother superior, and, having ordered  everyone to be silent, placed two of his fingers in her mouth, and,  having gone through the form of exorcism prescribed by the ritual, he  asked the following questions word for word as they are given,    D Why have you entered into the body of this young girl?    R Causa animositatis. Out of enmity.    D Per quod pactum? By what pact?    R Per flores. By flowers.    D Quales? What flowers?    R Rosas. Roses.    D Quis misfit? By whom wert thou sent?    At this question the magistrates remarked that the superior hesitated to  reply; twice she opened her mouth in vain, but the third time she said  in a weak voice--    D Dic cognomen? What is his surname?    R Urbanus. Urbain.    Here there was again the same hesitation, but as if impelled by the will  of the exorcist she answered:        R.  Grandier.                 Grandier.      D.  Dic qualitatem?           What is his profession?      R.  Sacerdos.                 A priest.      D.  Cujus ecclesiae?          Of what church?      R.  Sancti Petri.             Saint-Pierre.      D.  Quae persona attulit          flores?                   Who brought the flowers?      R.  Diabolica.                Someone sent by the devil.    As the patient pronounced the last word she recovered her senses, and  having repeated a prayer, attempted to swallow a morsel of bread which  was offered her; she was, however, obliged to spit it out, saying it was  so dry she could not get it down.    Something more liquid was then brought, but even of that she could  swallow very little, as she fell into convulsions every few minutes.    Upon this the two officials, seeing there was nothing more to be got out  of the superior, withdrew to one of the window recesses and began to  converse in a low tone; whereupon Mignon, who feared that they had not  been sufficiently impressed, followed them, and drew their attention to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2747"],[0,"Nisida (#5)"],[1,"isdom; for I wanted to speak to you  before coming to know him, so as not to go on with a conversation that  you might not approve. But there is a hindrance.\"    \"You know that I do not recognise any when it is a question of making my  daughter happy.\"    \"He is poor, father.\"    \"Well, all the more reason for me to like him. There is work here for  everybody, and my table can spare a place for another son. He is young,  he has arms; no doubt he has some calling.\"    \"He is a poet.\"    \"No matter; tell him to come and speak to me, and if he is an honest  lad, I promise you, my child, that I will do anything in the world to  promote your happiness.\"    Nisida embraced her father effusively, and was beside herself with joy  all day, waiting impatiently for the evening in order to give the young  man such splendid news. Eligi Brancaleone was but moderately flattered,  as you will easily believe, by the fisherman's magnanimous intentions  towards him; but like the finished seducer that he was, he appeared  enchanted at them. Recollecting his character as a fantastical student  and an out-at-elbows poet, he fell upon his knees and shouted a  thanksgiving to the planet Venus; then, addressing the young girl, he  added, in a calmer voice, that he was going to write immediately to his  own father, who in a week's time would come to make his formal proposal;  until then, he begged, as a favour, that he might not present himself to  Solomon nor to any person at all in the island, and assigned as a  pretext a certain degree of shame which he felt on account of his old  clothes, assuring his beloved that his father would bring him a complete  outfit for the wedding-day.    While the ill-starred girl was thus walking in terrifying security at  the edge of the precipice, Trespolo, following his master's wishes, had  established himself in the island as a pilgrim from Jerusalem. Playing  his part and sprinkling his conversation with biblical phrases, which  came to him readily, in his character of ex-sacristan, he distributed  abundance of charms, wood of the true Cross and milk of the Blessed  Virgin, and all those other inexhaustible treasures on which the eager  devotion of worthy people daily feeds. His relics were the more  evidently authentic in that he did not sell any of them, and, bearing  his poverty in a holy manner, thanked the faithful and declined their  alms. Only, out of regard for the established virtue of Solomon, he had  consented to break bread with the fisherman, and went to take meals with  him with the regularity of a cenobite. His abstinence aroused universal  surprise: a crust dipped in water, a few nuts or figs sufficed to keep  this holy man alive--to prevent him, that is to say, from dying.  Furthermore, he entertained Nisida by his tales of his travels and by  his mysterious predictions. Unfortunately, he only appeared towards  evening; for he spent the rest of the day in austerities and in  prayers--in other words, in drinking like a Turk and snoring like a  buffalo.    On the morning of the seventh day, after the promise given by the prince  to the fisherman's daughter, Brancaleone came into his servant's room,  and, shaking hint roughly, cried in his ear, \"Up, odious marmot!\"    Trespolo, awakened suddenly, rubbed his eyes in alarm. The dead,  sleeping peacefully at the bottom of their coffins, will be less annoyed  at the last day when the trump of Judgment comes to drag them from their  slumbers. Fear having, however, immediately dispersed the dark clouds  that overspread his countenance, he sat up, and asked with an appearance  of bewilderment--    \"What is the matter, your excellency?\"    \"The matter is that I will have you flayed alive a little if you do not  leave off that execrable habit of sleeping twenty hours in the day.\"    \"I was not asleep, prince!\" cried the servant boldly, as he sprang out  of bed; \"I was reflecting---\"    \"Listen to me,\" said the prince in a severe tone; \"you were once  employed, I believe, in a chemist's shop?\"    \"Yes, my lord, and I left because my employer had the scandalous  barbarity to make me pound drugs, which tired my arms horribly.\"    \"Here is a phial containing a solution of opium.\"    \"Mercy!\" cried Trespolo, falling on his knees.    \"Get up, idiot, and pay great attention to what I am going to say to  you. This little fool of a Nisida persists in wanting me to speak to her  father. I made her believe that I was going away this evening to fetch  my papers. There is no time to lose. They know you very well at the  fisherman's. You will pour this liquid into their wine; your life will  answer for your not giving them a larger dose than enough to produce a  deep sleep. You will take care to prepare me a good ladder for to-night;  after which you will go and wait for me in my boat, where you will find  Numa and Bonaroux. They have my orders. I shall not want you in scaling  the fortress; I have my Campo Basso dagger.\"    \"But, my lord---\" stammered Trespolo, astounded.    \"No difficulties!\" cried the prince, stamping his foot furiously, \"or,  by my father's death, I will cure you, once for all, of your scruples.\"  And he turned on his heel with the air of a man who is certain that  people will be very careful not to disobey his orders.    The unhappy Trespolo fulfilled his master's injunctions punctually. With  him fear was the guiding principle. That evening the fisherman's supper  table was hopelessly dull, and the sham pilgrim tried in vain to enliven  it by factitious cheerfulness. Nisida was preoccupied by her lover's  departure, and Solomon, sharing unconsciously in his daughter's grief,  swallowed but a drop or two of wine, to avoid resisting the repeated  urgency of his guest. Gabriel had set out in the morning for Sorrento  and was not to return for two or three days; his absence tended to  increase the old man's melancholy. As soon as Trespolo had retired, the  fisherman yielded to his fatigue. Nisida, with her arms hanging by her  sides, her head heavy and her heart oppressed by a sad presentiment, had  scarcely strength to go up to her room, and after having mechanically  trimmed the lamp, sank on her bed as pale and stiff as a corpse.    The storm was breaking out with violence; one of those terrible storms  seen only in the South, when the congregated clouds, parting suddenly,  shed torrents of rain and of hail, and threaten another deluge. The roar  of the thunder drew nearer and was like the noise of a cannonade. The  gulf, lately so calm and smooth that the island was reflected as in a  mirror, had suddenly darkened; the furiously leaping waves flung  themselves together like wild horses; the island quaked, shaken by  terrible shocks. Even the boldest fishermen had drawn their boats  ashore, and, shut within their cabins, encouraged as best they could  their frightened wives and children.    Amid the deep darkness that overspread the sea Nisida's lamp could be  seen gleaming clear and limpid, as it burned before the Madonna. Two  boats, without rudders, sails, or oars, tossed by the waves, beaten by  the winds, were whirling above the abyss; two men were in these two  boats, their muscles tense, their breasts bare, their hair flying. They  gazed haughtily on the sea, and braved the tempest.    \"Once more, I beg you,\" cried one of these men, \"fear not for me,  Gabriel; I promise you that with my two broken oars and a little  perseverance I shall get to Torre before daybreak.\"    \"You are mad, Bastiano; we have not been able ever since the morning to  get near Vico, and have been obliged to keep tacking about; your skill  and strength have been able to do nothing against this frightful  hurricane which has driven us back to this point.\"    \"It is the first time you have ever refused to go with me,\" remarked the  young man.    \"Well, yes, my dear Bastiano, I do not know how it is, but to-night I  feel drawn to the island by an irresistible power. The winds have been  unchained to bring me back to it in spite of myself, and I will own to  you, even though it should make me seem like a madman in your eyes, that  this simple and ordinary event appears to me like an order from heaven.  Do you see that lamp shining over there?\"    \"I know it,\" answered Bastiano, suppressing a sigh.    \"It was lighted before the Virgin one the day when my sister was born,  and for eighteen year it has never ceased to burn, night and day. It was  my mother's vow. You do not know, my dear Bastiano, you cannot know how  many torturing thoughts that vow recalls to me. My poor mother called me  to her deathbed and told me a frightful tale, a horrible secret, which  weighs on my soul like a cloak of lead, and of which I can only relieve  myself by confiding it to a friend. When her painful story was ended she  asked to see and to embrace my sister, who was just born; then with her  trembling hand, already chilled by the approach of death, she desired to  light the lamp herself. 'Remember,' these were her last words,  'remember, Gabriel, that your sister is vowed to the Madonna. As long as  this light shines before the blessed image of the Virgin, your sister  will be in no danger.' You can understand now why, at night, when we are  crossing the gulf, my eyes are always fixed on that lamp. I have a  belief that nothing could shake, which is that on the day that light  goes out my sister's soul will have taken flight to heaven.\"    \"Well,\" cried Bastiano in an abrupt tone that betrayed the emotion of  his heart, \"if you prefer to stay, I will go alone.\"    \"Farewell,\" said Gabriel, without turning aside his eyes from the window  towards which he felt himself drawn by a fascination for which he could  not account. Bastiano disappeared, and Nisida's brother, assisted by the  waves, was drawing nearer and nearer to the shore, when, at all once, he  uttered a terrible cry which sounded above the noise of the tempest.    The star had just been extinguished; the lamp had"]]]
