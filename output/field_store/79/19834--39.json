I was born on the 24th of March, 1803, in the Township of  Charlotteville, near the Village of Vittoria, in the then London  District, now the County of Norfolk. My Father had been an officer in  the British Army during the American Revolution, being a volunteer in  the Prince of Wales' Regiment of New Jersey, of which place he was a  native. His forefathers were from Holland, and his more remote ancestors  were from Denmark.    At the close of the American Revolutionary War, he, with many others of  the same class, went to New Brunswick, where he married my Mother, whose  maiden name was Stickney, a descendant of one of the early Massachusetts  Puritan settlers.    Near the close of the last century my Father, with his family, followed  an elder brother to Canada,[1] where he drew some 2,500 acres of land  from the Government, for his services in the army, besides his pension.  My Father settled on 600 acres of land lying about half-way between the  present Village of Vittoria and Port Ryerse, where my uncle Samuel  settled, and where he built the first mill in the County of Norfolk.    On the organization of the London District in 1800, for legal purposes,  my uncle was the Lieutenant of the County, issuing commissions in his  own name to militia officers; he was also Chairman of the Quarter  Sessions. My Father was appointed High Sheriff in 1800, but held the  office only six years, when he resigned it in behalf of the late Colonel  John Bostwick (then a surveyor), who subsequently married my eldest  sister, and who owned what is now Port Stanley, and was at one time a  Member of Parliament for the County of Middlesex.    My Father devoted himself exclusively to agriculture, and I learned to  do all kinds of farm-work. The district grammar-school was then kept  within half-a-mile of my Father's residence, by Mr. James Mitchell  (afterwards Judge Mitchell), an excellent classical scholar; he came  from Scotland with the late Rt. Rev. Dr. Strachan, first Bishop of  Toronto. Mr. Mitchell married my youngest sister. He treated me with  much kindness. When I recited to him my lessons in English grammar he  often said that he had never studied the English grammar himself, that  he wrote and spoke English by the Latin grammar. At the age of fourteen  I had the opportunity of attending a course of instruction in the  English language given by two professors, the one an Englishman, and the  other an American, who taught nothing but English grammar. They  professed in one course of instruction, by lectures, to enable a  diligent pupil to parse any sentence in the English language. I was sent  to attend these lectures, the only boarding abroad for school  instruction I ever enjoyed. My previous knowledge of the _letter_ of the  grammar was of great service to me, and gave me an advantage over other  pupils, so that before the end of the course I was generally called up  to give visitors an illustration of the success of the system, which was  certainly the most effective I have ever since witnessed, having charts,  etc., to illustrate the agreement and government of words.    This whole course of instruction by two able men, who did nothing but  teach grammar from one week's end to another had to me all the  attraction of a charm and a new discovery. It gratified both curiosity  and ambition, and I pursued it with absorbing interest, until I had gone  through Murray's two volumes of \"Expositions and Exercises,\" Lord Kames'  \"Elements of Criticism,\" and Blair's \"Lectures on Rhetoric,\" of which I  still have the notes which I then made. The same professors obtained  sufficient encouragement to give a second course of instruction and  lectures at Vittoria, and one of them becoming ill, the other solicited  my Father to allow me to assist him, as it would be useful to me, while  it would enable him to fulfil his engagements. Thus, before I was  sixteen, I was inducted as a teacher, by lecturing on my native  language. This course of instruction, and exercises in English, have  proved of the greatest advantage to me, not less in enabling me to study  foreign languages than in using my own.    But that to which I am principally indebted for any studious habits,  mental energy, or even capacity or decision of character, is religious  instruction, poured into my mind in my childhood by a Mother's counsels,  and infused into my heart by a Mother's prayers and tears. When very  small, under six years of age, having done something naughty, my Mother  took me into her bedroom, told me how bad and wicked what I had done  was, and what pain it caused her, kneeled down, clasped me to her bosom,  and prayed for me. Her tears, falling upon my head, seemed to penetrate  to my very heart. This was my first religious impression, and was never  effaced. Though thoughtless, and full of playful mischief, I never  afterwards knowingly grieved my Mother, or gave her other than  respectful and kind words.    At the close of the American War, in 1815, when I was twelve years of  age, my three elder brothers, George, William, and John, became deeply  religious, and I imbibed the same spirit. My consciousness of guilt and  sinfulness was humbling, oppressive, and distressing; and my experience  of relief, after lengthened fastings, watchings, and prayers, was clear,  refreshing, and joyous. In the end I simply trusted in Christ, and  looked to Him for a present salvation; and, as I looked up in my bed,  the light appeared to my mind, and, as I thought, to my bodily eye also,  in the form of One, white-robed, who approached the bedside with a  smile, and with more of the expression of the countenance of Titian's  Christ than of any person whom I have ever seen. I turned, rose to my  knees, bowed my head, and covered my face, rejoiced with trembling,  saying to a brother who was lying beside me, that the Saviour was now  near us. The change within was more marked than anything without and,  perhaps, the inward change may have suggested what appeared an outward  manifestation. I henceforth had new views, new feelings, new joys, and  new strength. I truly delighted in the law of the Lord, after the inward  man, and--        \"Jesus, all the day long, was my joy and my song.\"    From that time I became a diligent student, and new quickness and  strength seemed to be imparted to my understanding and memory. While  working on the farm I did more than ordinary day's work, that it might  show how industrious, instead of lazy, as some said, religion made a  person. I studied between three and six o'clock in the morning, carried  a book in my pocket during the day to improve odd moments by reading or  learning, and then reviewed my studies of the day aloud while walking  out in the evening.    To the Methodist way of religion my Father was, at that time, extremely  opposed, and refused me every facility for acquiring knowledge while I  continued to go amongst them. I did not, however, formally join them, in  order to avoid his extreme displeasure. A kind friend offered to give me  any book that I would commit to memory, and submit to his examination of  the same. In this way I obtained my first Latin grammar, \"Watts on the  Mind,\" and \"Watts' Logic.\"    My eldest brother, George, after the war, went to Union College, U.S.,  where he finished his collegiate studies. He was a fellow-student with  the late Dr. Wayland, and afterwards succeeded my brother-in-law as  Master of the London District Grammar School. His counsels,  examinations, and ever kind assistance were a great encouragement and of  immense service to me; and though he and I have since differed in  religious opinions, no other than most affectionate brotherly feeling  has ever existed between us to this day.[2]    When I had attained the age of eighteen, the Methodist minister in  charge of the circuit which embraced our neighbourhood, thought it not  compatible with the rules of the Church to allow, as had been done for  several years, the privileges of a member without my becoming one. I  then gave in my name for membership. Information of this was soon  communicated to my Father, who, in the course of a few days, said to me:  \"Egerton, I understand you have joined the Methodists; you must either  leave them or leave my house.\" He said no more, and I well knew that the  decree was final; but I had formed my decision in view of all possible  consequences, and I had the aid of a Mother's prayers, and a Mother's  tenderness, and a conscious Divine strength according to my need. The  next day I left home and became usher in the London District Grammar  School, applying myself to my new work with much diligence and  earnestness, so that I soon succeeded in gaining the good-will of  parents and pupils, and they were quite satisfied with my  services,--leaving the head master to his favourite pursuits of  gardening and building!    During two years I was thus teacher and student, advancing considerably  in classical studies. I took great delight in \"Locke on the Human  Understanding,\" Paley's \"Moral and Political Philosophy,\" and  \"Blackstone's Commentaries,\" especially the sections of the latter on  the Prerogatives of the Crown, the Rights of the Subject, and the  Province of Parliament.    As my Father complained that the Methodists had robbed him of his son,  and of the fruits of that son's labours, I wished to remove that ground  of complaint as far as possible by hiring an English farm-labourer, then  just arrived in Canada, in my place, and paid him out of the proceeds of  my own labour for two years. But although the farmer was the best hired  man my Father had ever had, the result of his farm-productions during  these two years did not equal those of the two years that I had been the  chief labourer on the farm, and my Father came to me one day uttering  the single sentence, \"Egerton, you must come home,\" and then walked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#5)"],[1,"rd, he was as well provided for as if he had been at  home. The hottest hours of the day had already arrived, when they  awoke again, and they unanimously determined to wait for evening in  this place. After they had eaten together, they moved more closely to  each other, and the young merchant, turning to the oldest, addressed  him: \"Selim Baruch yesterday made a pleasant afternoon for us; suppose  Achmet, that you also tell us something, be it either from your long  life, which has known so many adventures, or even a pretty Maerchen.\"    Upon these words Achmet was silent some time, as if he were in doubt  whether to tell this or that; at last he began to speak: \"Dear  friends, on this our journey you have proved yourselves faithful  companions, and Selim also deserves my confidence; I will therefore  impart to you something of my life, of which, under other  circumstances, I would speak reluctantly, and, indeed, not to any one:  THE HISTORY OF THE SPECTRE SHIP.\"          THE HISTORY OF THE SPECTRE SHIP.    [Illustration]      My father had a little shop in Balsora; he was neither rich, nor poor,  but one of those who do not like to risk any thing, through fear of  losing the little that they have. He brought me up plainly, but  virtuously, and soon I advanced so far, that I was able to make  valuable suggestions to him in his business. When I reached my  eighteenth year, in the midst of his first speculation of any  importance, he died; probably through anxiety at having intrusted a  thousand gold pieces to the sea. I was obliged, soon after, to deem  him happy in his fortunate death, for in a few weeks the intelligence  reached us, that the vessel, to which my father had committed his  goods, had been wrecked. This misfortune, however, could not depress  my youthful spirits. I converted all that my father had left into  money, and set out to try my fortune in foreign lands, accompanied  only by an old servant of the family, who, on account of ancient  attachment, would not part from me and my destiny.    In the harbor of Balsora we embarked, with a favorable wind. The ship,  in which I had taken passage, was bound to India. We had now for  fifteen days sailed in the usual track, when the Captain predicted to  us a storm. He wore a thoughtful look, for it seemed he knew that, in  this place, there was not sufficient depth of water to encounter a  storm with safety. He ordered them to take in all sail, and we moved  along quite slowly. The night set in clear and cold, and the Captain  began to think that he had been mistaken in his forebodings. All at  once there floated close by ours, a ship which none of us had  observed before. A wild shout and cry ascended from the deck, at  which, occurring at this anxious season, before a storm, I wondered  not a little. But the Captain by my side was deadly pale: \"My ship is  lost,\" cried he; \"there sails Death!\" Before I could demand an  explanation of these singular words, the sailors rushed in, weeping  and wailing. \"Have you seen it?\" they exclaimed: \"all is now over with  us!\"    But the Captain had words of consolation read to them out of the  Koran, and seated himself at the helm. But in vain! The tempest began  visibly to rise with a roaring noise, and, before an hour passed by,  the ship struck and remained aground. The boats were lowered, and  scarcely had the last sailors saved themselves, when the vessel went  down before our eyes, and I was launched, a beggar, upon the sea. But  our misfortune had still no end. Frightfully roared the tempest, the  boat could no longer be governed. I fastened myself firmly to my old  servant, and we mutually promised not to be separated from each other.  At last the day broke, but, with the first glance of the morning-red,  the wind struck and upset the boat in which we were seated. After that  I saw my shipmates no more. The shock deprived me of consciousness,  and when I returned to my senses, I found myself in the arms of my old  faithful attendant, who had saved himself on the boat which had been  upturned, and had come in search of me. The storm had abated; of our  vessel there was nothing any more to be seen, but we plainly descried,  at no great distance from us, another ship, towards which the waves  were driving us. As we approached, I recognised the vessel as the same  which had passed by us in the night, and which had thrown the Captain  into such consternation. I felt a strange horror of this ship; the  intimation of the Captain, which had been so fearfully corroborated,  the desolate appearance of the ship, on which, although as we drew  near we uttered loud cries, no one was visible, alarmed me.  Nevertheless this was our only expedient; accordingly, we praised the  Prophet, who had so miraculously preserved us.    From the fore-part of the ship hung down a long cable; for the purpose  of laying hold of this, we paddled with our hands and feet. At last  we were successful. Loudly I raised my voice, but all remained quiet  as ever, on board the vessel. Then we climbed up by the rope, I, as  the youngest, taking the lead. But horror! what a spectacle was there  presented to my eye, as I stepped upon the deck! The floor was red  with blood; upon it lay twenty or thirty corpses in Turkish costume;  by the middle-mast stood a man richly attired, with sabre in hand--but  his face was wan and distorted; through his forehead passed a large  spike which fastened him to the mast--he was dead! Terror chained my  feet; I dared hardly to breathe. At last my companion stood by my  side; he, too, was overpowered at sight of the deck which exhibited no  living thing, but only so many frightful corpses. After having, in the  anguish of our souls, supplicated the Prophet, we ventured to move  forward. At every step we looked around to see if something new,  something still more horrible, would not present itself. But all  remained as it was--far and wide, no living thing but ourselves, and  the ocean-world. Not once did we dare to speak aloud, through fear  that the dead Captain there nailed to the mast would bend his rigid  eyes upon us, or lest one of the corpses should turn his head. At last  we arrived at a staircase, which led into the hold. There  involuntarily we came to a halt, and looked at each other, for neither  of us exactly ventured to express his thoughts.    \"Master,\" said my faithful servant, \"something awful has happened  here. Nevertheless, even if the ship down there below is full of  murderers, still would I rather submit myself to their mercy or  cruelty, than spend a longer time among these dead bodies.\" I agreed  with him, and so we took heart, and descended, full of apprehension.  But the stillness of death prevailed here also, and there was no sound  save that of our steps upon the stairs. We stood before the door of  the cabin; I applied my ear, and listened--there was nothing to be  heard. I opened it. The room presented a confused appearance; clothes,  weapons, and other articles, lay disordered together. The crew, or at  least the Captain, must shortly before have been carousing, for the  remains of a banquet lay scattered around. We went on from room to  room, from chamber to chamber finding, in all, royal stores of silk,  pearls, and other costly articles. I was beside myself with joy at the  sight, for as there was no one on the ship, I thought I could  appropriate all to myself; but Ibrahim thereupon called to my notice  that we were still far from land, at which we could not arrive, alone  and without human help.    We refreshed ourselves with the meats and drink, which we found in  rich profusion, and at last ascended upon deck. But here again we  shivered at the awful sight of the bodies. We determined to free  ourselves therefrom, by throwing them overboard; but how were we  startled to find, that no one could move them from their places! So  firmly were they fastened to the floor, that to remove them one would  have had to take up the planks of the deck, for which tools were  wanting to us. The Captain, moreover, could not be loosened from the  mast, nor could we even wrest the sabre from his rigid hand. We passed  the day in sorrowful reflection on our condition; and, when night  began to draw near, I gave permission to the old Ibrahim to lie down  to sleep, while I would watch upon the deck, to look out for means of  deliverance. When, however, the moon shone forth, and by the stars I  calculated that it was about the eleventh hour, sleep so irresistibly  overpowered me that I fell back, involuntarily, behind a cask which  stood upon the deck. It was rather lethargy than sleep, for I plainly  heard the sea beat against the side of the vessel, and the sails creak  and whistle in the wind. All at once I thought I heard voices, and the  steps of men upon the deck. I wished to arise and see what it was, but  a strange power fettered my limbs, and I could not once open my eyes.  But still more distinct became the voices; it appeared to me as if a  merry crew were moving around upon the deck. In the midst of this I  thought I distinguished the powerful voice of a commander, followed by  the noise of ropes and sails. Gradually my senses left me; I fell into  a deep slumber, in which I still seemed to hear the din of weapons,  and awoke only when the sun was high in the heavens, and sent down his  burning rays upon my face. Full of wonder, I gazed about me; storm,  ship, the bodies, and all that I had heard in the night, recurred to  me as a dream; but when I looked around, I found all as it had been  the day before. Immoveable lay the bodies, immoveably was the Captain  fastened to the mast; I laughed at my dream, and proceeded in search  of my old companion.    The latter was seated in sorrowful meditation in the cabin. \"O  master,\" he exclaimed as I entered, \"rather would I lie in the deepest  bottom of the sea, than pass another night in this enchanted ship.\" I  asked him the reason of"]]]
