Things may turn out differently than you expect.\"    \"All right, Judge.\" The visitor resigned himself to whatever might  transpire under the guidance of the man he had called upon to turn him  over to the officers of the law.           *       *       *       *       *    Seated in the judge's ancient motor car, they stopped at the office of  Alton Forsythe a few minutes later and were joined by that red-faced and  pompous old man. Few words were spoken during the short run to the  well-remembered location of Tom's laboratory, and the man who was known  as George Voight caught at his own throat with nervous fingers when they  passed the tumbledown remains of the hut in which Old Crompton had spent  so many years. With a screeching of well-worn brakes the car stopped  before the laboratory, which was now almost hidden behind a mass of  shrubs and flowers.    \"Easy now, young man,\" cautioned the judge, noting the look of fear  which had clouded his new client's features. The three men advanced to  the door through which Old Crompton had fled on that night of horror,  twelve years before. The elder Forsythe spoke not a word as he turned  the knob and stepped within. Voight shrank from entering, but soon  mastered his feelings and followed the other two. The sight that met his  eyes caused him to cry aloud in awe.    At the dissecting table, which seemed to be exactly as he had seen it  last but with replicas of the tubes he had destroyed once more in place,  stood Tom Forsythe! Considerably older and with hair prematurely gray,  he was still the young man Old Crompton thought he had killed. Tom  Forsythe was not dead after all! And all of his years of misery had gone  for nothing. He advanced slowly to the side of the wondering young man,  Alton Forsythe and Asa Culkin watching silently from just inside the  door.    \"Tom--Tom,\" spoke the stranger, \"you are alive? You were not dead when I  left you on that terrible night when I smashed your precious tubes?  Oh--it is too good to be true! I can scarcely believe my eyes!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He stretched forth trembling fingers to touch the body of the young man  to assure himself that it was not all a dream.    \"Why,\" said Tom Forsythe, in astonishment. \"I do not know you, sir.  Never saw you in my life. What do you mean by your talk of smashing my  tubes, of leaving me for dead?\"    \"Mean?\" The stranger's voice rose now; he was growing excited. \"Why,  Tom, I am Old Crompton. Remember the struggle, here in this very room?  You refused to rejuvenate an unhappy old man with your marvelous  apparatus, a temporarily insane old man--Crompton. I was that old man  and I fought with you. You fell, striking your head. There was blood.  You were unconscious. Yes, for many hours I was sure you were dead and  that I had murdered you. But I had watched your manipulations of the  apparatus and I subjected myself to the action of the rays. My youth was  miraculously restored. I became as you see me now. Detection was  impossible, for I looked no more like Old Crompton than you do. I  smashed your machinery to avoid suspicion. Then I escaped. And, for  twelve years, I have thought myself a murderer. I have suffered the  tortures of the damned!\"    Tom Forsythe advanced on this remarkable visitor with clenched fists.  Staring him in the eyes with cold appraisal, his wrath was all too  apparent. The dog Spot, young as ever, entered the room and, upon  observing the stranger, set up an ominous growling and snarling. At  least the dog recognized him!    \"What are you trying to do, catechise me? Are you another of these  alienists my father has been bringing around?\" The young inventor was  furious. \"If you are,\" he continued, \"you can get out of here--now! I'll  have no more of this meddling with my affairs. I'm as sane as any of you  and I refuse to submit to this continual persecution.\"    The elder Forsythe grunted, and Culkin laid a restraining hand on his  arm. \"Just a minute now, Tom,\" he said soothingly. \"This stranger is no  alienist. He has a story to tell. Please permit him to finish.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Somewhat mollified, Tom Forsythe shrugged his assent.    \"Tom,\" continued the stranger, more calmly now, \"what I have said is the  truth. I shall prove it to you. I'll tell you things no mortals on earth  could know but we two. Remember the day I captured the big rooster for  you--the monster you had created? Remember the night you awakened me and  brought me here in the moonlight? Remember the rabbit whose leg you  amputated and re-grew? The poor guinea pig you had suffocated and whose  life you restored? Spot here? Don't you remember rejuvenating him? I was  here. And you refused to use your process on me, old man that I was.  Then is when I went mad and attacked you. Do you believe me, Tom?\"    Then a strange thing happened. While Tom Forsythe gazed in growing  belief, the stranger's shoulders sagged and he trembled as with the  ague. The two older men who had kept in the background gasped their  astonishment as his hair faded to a sickly gray, then became as white as  the driven snow. Old Crompton was reverting to his previous state!  Within five minutes, instead of the handsome young stranger, there  stood before them a bent, withered old man--Old Crompton beyond a doubt.  The effects of Tom's process were spent.    \"Well I'm damned!\" ejaculated Alton Forsythe. \"You have been right all  along, Asa. And I am mighty glad I did not commit Tom as I intended. He  has told us the truth all these years and we were not wise enough to see  it.\"    \"We!\" exclaimed the judge. \"You, Alton Forsythe! I have always upheld  him. You have done your son a grave injustice and you owe him your  apologies if ever a father owed his son anything.\"    \"You are right, Asa.\" And, his aristocratic pride forgotten, Alton  Forsythe rushed to the side of his son and embraced him.    The judge turned to Old Crompton pityingly. \"Rather a bad ending for  you, Crompton,\" he said. \"Still, it is better by far than being branded  as a murderer.\"    \"Better? Better?\" croaked Old Crompton. \"It is wonderful, Judge. I have  never been so happy in my life!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The face of the old man beamed, though scalding tears coursed down the  withered and seamed cheeks. The two Forsythes looked up from their  demonstrations of peacemaking to listen to the amazing words of the old  hermit.    \"Yes, happy for the first time in my life,\" he continued. \"I am one  hundred years of age, gentlemen, and I now look it and feel it. That is  as it should be. And my experience has taught me a final lasting lesson.  None of you know it, but, when I was but a very young man I was bitterly  disappointed in love. Ha! ha! Never think it to look at me now, would  you? But I was, and it ruined my entire life. I had a little  money--inherited--and I traveled about in the world for a few years,  then settled in that old hut across the road where I buried myself for  sixty years, becoming crabbed and sour and despicable. Young Tom here  was the first bright spot and, though I admired him, I hated him for  his opportunities, hated him for that which he had that I had not. With  the promise of his invention I thought I saw happiness, a new life for  myself. I got what I wanted, though not in the way I had expected. And I  want to tell you gentlemen that there is nothing in it. With  developments of modern science you may be able to restore a man's  youthful vigor of body, but you can't cure his mind with electricity.  Though I had a youthful body, my brain was the brain of an old  man--memories were there which could not be suppressed. Even had I not  had the fancied death of young Tom on my conscience I should still have  been miserable. I worked. God, how I worked--to forget! But I could not  forget. I was successful in business and made a lot of money. I am more  independent--probably wealthier than you, Alton Forsythe, but that did  not bring happiness. I longed to be myself once more, to have the aches  and pains which had been taken from me. It is natural to age and to die.  Immortality would make of us a people of restless misery. We would  quarrel and bicker and long for death, which would not come to relieve  us. Now it is over for me and I am glad--glad--glad!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He paused for breath, looking beseechingly at Tom Forsythe. \"Tom,\" he  said, \"I suppose you have nothing for me in your heart but hatred. And I  don't blame you. But I wish--I wish you would try and forgive me. Can  you?\"    The years had brought increased understanding and tolerance to young  Tom. He stared at Old Crompton and the long-nursed anger over the  destruction of his equipment melted into a strange mixture of pity and  admiration for the courageous old fellow.    \"Why, I guess I can, Crompton,\" he replied. \"There was many a day when I  struggled hopelessly to reconstruct my apparatus, cursing you with every  bit of energy in my make-up. I could cheerfully have throttled you, had  you been within reach. For twelve years I have labored incessantly to  reproduce the results we obtained on the night of which you speak.  People called me insane--even my father wished to have me committed to  an asylum. And, until now, I have been unsuccessful. Only to-day has it  seemed for the first time that the experiments will again succeed. But  my ideas have changed with regard to the uses of the process. I was a  cocksure young pup in the old days, with foolish dreams of fame and  influence. But I have seen the error of my ways."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2865"],[0,"Otto of the Silver Hand (#5)"],[1,"up and down, as though to gather his wits.    \"So!\" said he, \"there was something else that he told me. Tschk! If I  could but think now. Yes, good! This is it--'Nothing that has lived,'  said he, 'shall ever die, and nothing that has died shall ever live.'\"    Otto drew a deep breath. \"I would that I might see the beautiful Angel  Gabriel sometime,\" said he; but Brother John was singing again and did  not seem to hear what he said.    Next to Brother John, the nearest one to the little child was the good  Abbot Otto, for though he had never seen wonderful things with the eyes  of his soul, such as Brother John's had beheld, and so could not tell of  them, he was yet able to give little Otto another pleasure that no one  else could give.    He was a great lover of books, the old Abbot, and had under lock and key  wonderful and beautiful volumes, bound in hog-skin and metal, and with  covers inlaid with carved ivory, or studded with precious stones. But  within these covers, beautiful as they were, lay the real wonder of the  books, like the soul in the body; for there, beside the black letters  and initials, gay with red and blue and gold, were beautiful pictures  painted upon the creamy parchment. Saints and Angels, the Blessed Virgin  with the golden oriole about her head, good St. Joseph, the three Kings;  the simple Shepherds kneeling in the fields, while Angels with glories  about their brow called to the poor Peasants from the blue sky above.  But, most beautiful of all was the picture of the Christ Child lying in  the manger, with the mild-eyed Kine gazing at him.    Sometimes the old Abbot would unlock the iron-bound chest where these  treasures lay hidden, and carefully and lovingly brushing the few grains  of dust from them, would lay them upon the table beside the oriel window  in front of his little namesake, allowing the little boy freedom to turn  the leaves as he chose.    Always it was one picture that little Otto sought; the Christ Child in  the manger, with the Virgin, St. Joseph, the Shepherds, and the Kine.  And as he would hang breathlessly gazing and gazing upon it, the old  Abbot would sit watching him with a faint, half-sad smile flickering  around his thin lips and his pale, narrow face.    It was a pleasant, peaceful life, but by-and-by the end came. Otto was  now nearly twelve years old.    One bright, clear day, near the hour of noon, little Otto heard the  porter's bell sounding below in the court-yard--dong! dong! Brother  Emmanuel had been appointed as the boy's instructor, and just then Otto  was conning his lessons in the good monk's cell. Nevertheless, at the  sound of the bell he pricked up his ears and listened, for a visitor was  a strange matter in that out-of-the-way place, and he wondered who it  could be. So, while his wits wandered his lessons lagged.    \"Postera Phoeba lustrabat lampade terras,\" continued Brother Emmanuel,  inexorably running his horny finger-nail beneath the line, \"humentemque  Aurora polo dimoverat umbram--\" the lesson dragged along.    Just then a sandaled footstep sounded without, in the stone corridor,  and a light tap fell upon Brother Emmanuel's door. It was Brother  Ignatius, and the Abbot wished little Otto to come to the refectory.    As they crossed the court-yard Otto stared to see a group of mail-clad  men-at-arms, some sitting upon their horses, some standing by the  saddle-bow. \"Yonder is the young baron,\" he heard one of them say in a  gruff voice, and thereupon all turned and stared at him.    A stranger was in the refectory, standing beside the good old Abbot,  while food and wine were being brought and set upon the table for his  refreshment; a great, tall, broad-shouldered man, beside whom the Abbot  looked thinner and slighter than ever.    The stranger was clad all in polished and gleaming armor, of plate and  chain, over which was drawn a loose robe of gray woollen stuff, reaching  to the knees and bound about the waist by a broad leathern sword-belt.  Upon his arm he carried a great helmet which he had just removed from  his head. His face was weather-beaten and rugged, and on lip and chin  was a wiry, bristling beard; once red, now frosted with white.    Brother Ignatius had bidden Otto to enter, and had then closed the door  behind him; and now, as the lad walked slowly up the long room, he gazed  with round, wondering blue eyes at the stranger.    \"Dost know who I am, Otto? said the mail-clad knight, in a deep,  growling voice.    \"Methinks you are my father, sir,\" said Otto.    \"Aye, thou art right,\" said Baron Conrad, \"and I am glad to see that  these milk-churning monks have not allowed thee to forget me, and who  thou art thyself.\"    \"An' it please you,\" said Otto, \"no one churneth milk here but  Brother Fritz; we be makers of wine and not makers of butter, at St.  Michaelsburg.\"    Baron Conrad broke into a great, loud laugh, but Abbot Otto's sad and  thoughtful face lit up with no shadow of an answering smile.    \"Conrad,\" said he, turning to the other, \"again let me urge thee; do  not take the child hence, his life can never be your life, for he is not  fitted for it. I had thought,\" said he, after a moment's pause, \"I had  thought that thou hadst meant to consecrate him--this motherless one--to  the care of the Universal Mother Church.\"    \"So!\" said the Baron, \"thou hadst thought that, hadst thou? Thou hadst  thought that I had intended to deliver over this boy, the last of the  Vuelphs, to the arms of the Church? What then was to become of our name  and the glory of our race if it was to end with him in a monastery? No,  Drachenhausen is the home of the Vuelphs, and there the last of the race  shall live as his sires have lived before him, holding to his rights by  the power and the might of his right hand.\"    The Abbot turned and looked at the boy, who was gaping in simple  wide-eyed wonderment from one to the other as they spoke.    \"And dost thou think, Conrad,\" said the old man, in his gentle, patient  voice, \"that that poor child can maintain his rights by the strength of  his right hand?\"    The Baron's look followed the Abbot's, and he said nothing.    In the few seconds of silence that followed, little Otto, in his simple  mind, was wondering what all this talk portended. Why had his father  come hither to St. Michaelsburg, lighting up the dim silence of the  monastery with the flash and ring of his polished armor? Why had he  talked about churning butter but now, when all the world knew that the  monks of St. Michaelsburg made wine.    It was Baron Conrad's deep voice that broke the little pause of silence.    \"If you have made a milkmaid of the boy,\" he burst out at last, \"I thank  the dear heaven that there is yet time to undo your work and to make a  man of him.\"    The Abbot sighed. \"The child is yours, Conrad,\" said he, \"the will of  the blessed saints be done. Mayhap if he goes to dwell at Drachenhausen  he may make you the better instead of you making him the worse.\"    Then light came to the darkness of little Otto's wonderment; he saw what  all this talk meant and why his father had come hither. He was to leave  the happy, sunny silence of the dear White Cross, and to go out into  that great world that he had so often looked down upon from the high  windy belfry on the steep hillside.          VI. How Otto Lived in the Dragon's House.    The gates of the Monastery stood wide open, the world lay beyond, and  all was ready for departure. Baron Conrad and his men-at-arms sat foot  in stirrup, the milk-white horse that had been brought for Otto stood  waiting for him beside his father's great charger.    \"Farewell, Otto,\" said the good old Abbot, as he stooped and kissed the  boy's cheek.    \"Farewell,\" answered Otto, in his simple, quiet way, and it brought  a pang to the old man's heart that the child should seem to grieve so  little at the leave-taking.    \"Farewell, Otto,\" said the brethren that stood about, \"farewell,  farewell.\"    Then poor brother John came forward and took the boy's hand, and looked  up into his face as he sat upon his horse. \"We will meet again,\" said  he, with his strange, vacant smile, \"but maybe it will be in Paradise,  and there perhaps they will let us lie in the father's belfry, and look  down upon the angels in the court-yard below.\"    \"Aye,\" answered Otto, with an answering smile.    \"Forward,\" cried the Baron, in a deep voice, and with a clash of hoofs  and jingle of armor they were gone, and the great wooden gates were shut  to behind them.    Down the steep winding pathway they rode, and out into the great wide  world beyond, upon which Otto and brother John had gazed so often from  the wooden belfry of the White Cross on the hill.    \"Hast been taught to ride a horse by the priests up yonder on  Michaelsburg?\" asked the Baron, when they had reached the level road.    \"Nay,\" said Otto; \"we had no horse to ride, but only to bring in the  harvest or the grapes from the further vineyards to the vintage.\"    \"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"methought the abbot would have had enough of  the blood of old days in his veins to have taught thee what is fitting  for a knight to know; art not afeared?\"    \"Nay,\" said Otto, with a smile, \"I am not afeared.\"    \"There at least thou showest thyself a Vuelph,\" said the grim Baron. But  perhaps Otto's thought of fear and Baron Conrad's thought of fear were  two very different matters.    The afternoon had passed by the time they had reached the end of their  journey. Up the steep, stony path they rode to the drawbridge and  the great gaping gateway of Drachenhausen, where wall and tower and  battlement looked darker and more forbidding than ever in the gray  twilight of the coming night. Little Otto looked up with great,  wondering, awe-struck eyes at this grim new home of his.    The next moment they clattered over the drawbridge that spanned the  narrow black gulph between the roadway and the wall, and the next were  past the"]]]
