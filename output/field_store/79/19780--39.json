MARY VIOLA TINGLEY LAWRENCE _to be  read before a_ SAN FRANCISCO _literary society on_ MRS. LOUISE AMELIA  KNAPP SMITH CLAPPE (DAME SHIRLEY)      The Shirley Letters, written in the pioneer days of 1851 and 1852, were  hailed throughout the country as the first-born of California  literature. Mrs. Clappe, their author, was the one woman who depicted  that era of romantic life, dipping her pen into a rich personal  experience, and writing with a clarity and beauty born of an alert  comprehensive mind and a rare sense of refinement and character.    The Letters had been written to a loved sister in the East, but  Ferdinand C. Ewer, a _litterateur_ of San Francisco, a close friend,  fell upon them by chance, and, realizing their historic value, urged  that they be published in the Pioneer, of which he was editor. These  Shirley Letters, thus published, brought the new West to the wondering  East, and showed to those who had not made the venture, the courage,  the fervor, the beauty, the great-heartedness, that made up life in the  new El Dorado. Shirley's sympathetic Interpretation of their tumultuous  experience cheered the Argonauts by throwing before their eyes the  drama in which they were unconsciously the swash-buckling, the tragic,  or the romantic actors, and helped to crystallize the growing love for  the new land, which love turned fortune and adventure seekers into  home-makers and empire-builders.    This quickly recognized author became the leader of the first _salon_  the Golden West ever knew, and one of the foremost influences in  California's social and intellectual life, by force of a high  intelligence and a heart and soul that were a noble woman's.    Louise Amelia Knapp Smith Clappe came to light in Elizabeth, New  Jersey, in 1819. Her father, Moses Smith, was a man of high scholarly  attainment, and by her mother, Lois Lee, she could claim an equally  gifted ancestry, and a close kinship with Julia Ward Howe. As a young  girl, together with several brothers and sisters, she was left  parentless, but there was a comfortable estate, and a faithful  guardian, the Hon. Osman Baker, a Member of Congress I believe, who saw  to it that they received the very best mental and physical training.  Shirley was educated at Amherst and Charlestown, Massachusetts, and at  Amherst was the family home.    At that day the epistolary art was a finished accomplishment, and in  childhood she evidenced a ready use of the quill pen. Later on, she  maintained correspondence with brilliant minds, who challenged her to  her best. At the same time she was pursuing her English studies, to  which were added French, German, and Italian. She had but little time  for the trivial social amenities, but her frequent missives from her  relatives, the Lees and Wards of New York City and Boston, and her  enjoyable visits to their gay homes, broke the strain of mental grind,  and kept her in touch with the fashionable world. Her communications in  the forties disclose a relation to men and women of culture, whose  letters are colorful of people, places, and events, and through them we  reach an intimate inside of her own self. Those faded, musty-smelling  epistles, with pressed flowers, from an old attic, reveal a rich kind  of distinct and charming personalities.    Shirley, small, fair, and golden-haired, was not physically strong, and  her careful guardian often ordered a change of climate. Sometimes she  sojourned in the South. In her migrations she might employ a carriage,  or venture on a canal-boat, but usually the stage-coach carried her. It  was on one of those bits of travel that she met Mr. A. H. Everett of  Massachusetts, a brother of Edward Everett, a noted author, and popular  throughout the country as a lecturer. He had been charge d'affaires in  the Netherlands, and minister to Spain. An intimate relationship,  chiefly by correspondence, was established between this gifted girl and  this brilliant gentleman. His long letters from Louisiana sometimes  were written wholly in French. From Washington, D.C., he writes that  the mission of United States minister to a foreign court has been  offered him, but it fails to tempt him away from his life of letters.  However, later on, it comes about that he accepts the mission of United  States commissioner to the more alluring China, and his long letters to  her from there, as they had been from other foreign lands, were most  entertaining. This rare man grows to be very fond of his young and  brilliant correspondent, and signs himself, \"Yours faithfully and  affectionately.\" But he was well on in years, and she looks upon him  more as a father than as a suitor, and he so understands it. He commits  himself enough to say how much it would be to him to have her near him  as an attachee, and when she hints of her engagement to a young  physician, he jealously begs to know every detail concerning the happy  man.    Shirley married Dr. Fayette Clappe, and in 1849, with the spirit of  romance and the fire of enthusiasm, the joyful young Argonauts set sail  for California in the good ship Manilla.    They found the primitive San Francisco enthralling, but a fire swept  away the new city, and tent-life was accepted as one of many  picturesque experiences. Soon, however, the Doctor's shingle was again  hung out.    Quickly buildings went up, and the little lady with golden curls to her  waist went about, jostling the motley crowd of people, and finding  concern in the active city front, in the gaudy shops, and in the open  faro-banks with their exposed piles of nuggets and bags of gold-dust  freshly dug from the earth.    There was the ever-beckoning to the hills of treasure, with their  extravagant stories of adventure, but the professional man was anchored  in the more prosy city, and buckled down to a commonplace existence.  The exhilarating ozone from the ocean, the wind blowing over the vast  area of sand, the red-flannel-shirted miner recklessly dumping out  sacks of gold-dust with which to pay his board-bill or to buy a pair of  boots, with maybe a nugget for Dr. Clappe when he eased a trivial  pain,--all these thrills were calls to the gold-filled Mother Earth.  Finally, Dr. Clappe's ill-health drove him to the Feather River,--a  high altitude, fifty miles from the summit of the Sierra Nevada, and  the highest point of gold-diggings. There he soon recovered, and to her  joy he wrote his wife to join him. And she had varying experiences in  transit to the prospective home, which was at Rich Bar,--rich indeed,  where a miner unearthed thirty-three pounds of gold in eight days, and  others panned out fifteen hundred dollars in one wash of dirt.    The sojourn at the gold-camp in the summers and winters of 1851 and  1852, with its tremendous and varied incidents and experiences, was a  compelling call to Shirley's facile pen. Here was her mine. Out of her  brain, out of her soul, out of her heart of gold, out of her wealth of  understanding of and love for her fellow-men, gratefully sprang those  SHIRLEY LETTERS that have enriched the field of letters, and, reaching  beyond the grasp of worldly gain, have set her enduringly in the hearts  of mankind.    Who can tell how far-reaching and inspiring were those illuminating  pages, those vividly depicted scenes enacted on the crowded stages of  the golden-lined bars of the famous Feather River! Bret Harte reads her  graphic and pathetic account of the fallen woman and the desperate men  being driven out of camp, and lo! we have the gripping tale of The  Outcasts of Poker Flat; and from another of her recitals came the  inspiration that set him to work on that entertaining story, The Luck  of Roaring Camp. And her incidental mention of the pet frog hopping on  the bar of the hotel, in the midst of a group of onlooking miners,--was  it the setting for Mark Twain's Jumping Frog of Calaveras?    During their sojourn at Rich and Indian bars, Shirley and her husband  became rich in experience. They folded their tent and left with  depleted purse, but they had righteously invested their God-bestowed  talents. There they had freely given the best of themselves; they were  leaving the imperishable impress of high ideals.    Upon their return to San Francisco the couple rejoined delightful  friends, and established a home. But reverses of fortune came, and  Shirley found it necessary to put her accomplishments to the practical  purpose of gaining a livelihood. By the advice of her friend Ferdinand  C. Ewer she entered the San Francisco public school department, where  for long years she taught, notably in the high schools.    Shirley was small in build, with a thin face and a finely shaped head.  Her limbs were perfect in symmetry. As a girl, doubtless she had claim  to a delicate beauty. She now showed the wear and tear of her mountain  experience, coupled with an accumulation of heart-breaking trouble. She  gave prodigally of all her gifts. She interpreted life and its arts to  all discerning pupils, and by the magic of her friendly intercourse won  their confidence. Quick to discover any unusual promise in a pupil, she  indefatigably and masterfully stirred up such a one to his or her best,  sometimes with remarks of approval, or by censuring recreancy with  stinging sarcasm, or with expressions of despair over infirmity of  purpose. Some of such scholars, notably among them Charles Warren  Stoddard, panned out gold in the field of letters. Many of her pupils,  including myself, absorbed much of her wonderful help, and it grew into  our subconsciousness and became a part of us. She was the long-time  friend of Bret Harte, and from her he gathered a wealth of knowledge  that served him well.    When Mr. Ewer was ordained in Grace Episcopal Church, San Francisco,  Shirley became a member of his parish, and together with his wife she  assisted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23286"],[0,"The Rover Boys Under Canvas; Or, The Mystery of the Wrecked Submarine (#5)"],[1,"of yellowish-black smoke which rolled  directly toward them.    \"The wind must be shifting,\" declared Jack, for all of the smoke  heretofore had rolled up the lake shore.    \"It's too bad it is coming this way,\" said Ruth. \"Miss Garwood  declares that a good deal of smoke from such shells is poisonous.\"  Miss Garwood was the head of the school for girls, and likewise an  authority in chemistry.    The road was filled with automobiles going and coming, and Randy had  all he could do to send the machine along without getting into some  sort of collision. The heavy smoke continued to roll across the lake,  and soon they were in the midst of this. It had a curious pungent odor  to it, which set them to sneezing and coughing.    \"No fun in this, I must say,\" declared Jack. The girls all had their  handkerchiefs to their faces, and May Powell looked as if she was  getting sick.    In a minute more they came within sight of Clearwater Hall, a large  structure setting back in well-kept grounds. There were numerous  bushes and flowers and quite a number of fair-sized trees.    Several automobiles had reached the school ahead of them so the scene  was one of animation. Town people, as well as scholars from the  Hixley High School, mingled with the cadets and the girls from  Clearwater Hall.    \"Go on in and find Mary,\" said Jack to his sister. \"Tell her we are  here to help her in case anything happens.\"    Martha rushed off, followed by Ruth, and the two soon located Fred's  sister. She was in a rear room of the school, along with a number of  the other pupils and one of the assistant teachers.    \"Oh, I'm so glad you've come!\" declared Mary Rover. \"What a dreadful  thing this is getting to be!\"    \"I suppose it has made your head ache worse than ever,\" said Martha  sympathetically.    \"No, strange to say, it's just the other way around,\" declared Fred's  sister, with a faint smile. \"Those explosions seemed to have shocked  the headache all away.\"    Mary was glad to join the others, and the Rovers and their friends  proceeded to one of the reception rooms of the school. In the meantime  the explosions across the lake continued, but seemed to be gradually  dying down.    \"It looks to me as if the worst was over,\" remarked Fred, after there  had been comparative silence for fully a quarter of an hour.    \"Say, I'm going down to the lake front to see what's doing,\" declared  Randy, a little later. \"Perhaps we can be of some assistance.\"    \"That's the talk! We can't do anything more here,\" returned his twin.    \"Let's all go down!\" cried Jack. \"We ought to be able to do something  for those poor workmen who have been hurt.\" And then, turning to Ruth,  he continued: \"If there are any more big explosions and this place  seems to be in danger, we'll be back.\"    \"Oh, Jack! I don't want you to run into any danger down at the lake  shore,\" said the girl, looking at him pleadingly with her big brown  eyes.    \"I guess we'll be able to take care of ourselves,\" he answered  lightly. But it pleased him a great deal to have Ruth so full of  consideration for him.    Leaving their automobiles in the school grounds, the Rovers and their  chums left the place, crossed the highway, and followed the footpath  leading down to the Clearwater Hall boathouse. Here they found only a  few people congregated, the heavy-rolling clouds of smoke keeping a  good many away.    \"Not very pleasant here,\" was Gif Garrison's comment, after the smoke  had made him cough. \"I don't think I'm going to stay.\"    \"Neither am I,\" said Spouter. And presently he and quite a few others  left, leaving the four Rovers to themselves.    \"You know what I've got an idea of doing?\" declared Jack. \"Why not get  out one of the Clearwater Hall boats and row over a little closer to  that place? We may be able to be of some assistance to some of the  workmen.\"    The others were willing, and soon a large rowboat was brought out,  with two pairs of oars, and the four Rovers manned it and sent it well  out into the lake.    \"We've got to keep our eyes open in this smoke,\" declared Jack. \"It's  worse than a fog.\"    \"You're right there,\" returned Randy. \"If some of those poor  chaps----\"    _Boom!_    Another terrific explosion cut short what he was saying. The very  water under the rowboat seemed to shake, and the air presently was  filled with flying missiles dropping all around them. Then, as Andy  stood up in an endeavor to get a better view of the situation,  something came flying through the air, hit him on the shoulder, and  hurled him overboard!          CHAPTER IV    A RESCUE ON THE LAKE      \"Andy's overboard!\"    \"Grab him, somebody!\"    \"Wow! what is this anyway--a bombardment?\"    Such were the cries coming from the three Rovers when they saw the  luckless Andy lose his balance and go over into the lake with a  splash.    \"It's fire coming down! We've got to get out of this!\" cried Fred, a  few seconds later.    The youngest of the Rovers was right. It was indeed a rain of fire  that had suddenly descended upon them through the pall of  yellowish-black smoke. It was falling into the boat and on their  persons. Where it struck the lake it sent out a curious hissing sound.    \"Come--let us get Andy aboard again and row out of this as quickly as  possible!\" gasped Jack.    Andy had disappeared from view, but only for a few seconds. He came  up, thrashing around wildly, for he had been almost stunned by the  thing which had struck him, a block of wood carried up from the  ammunition plant by one of the explosions.    \"Steady, Andy, steady! We'll save you!\" called out his twin, and as  Fred and Jack sent the rowboat in the luckless one's direction, Randy  bent over and grabbed his brother by the hand. Then, taking care that  the craft should not tip over, Fred and Randy pulled Andy aboard.    \"Are you much hurt?\" questioned Randy anxiously.    \"I--I don't know,\" was the gasped-out reply. \"I--I don't think so,  though. What did you slam me in the back for?\" Andy demanded of Jack,  who had been behind him.    \"I didn't hit you. It was a block of wood which came sailing over from  the ammunition factory,\" was the quick reply. \"Come on--we've got to  get out of here, or the first thing you know we'll be on fire.\"    \"Better wet your clothing,\" said Andy. \"It may help a whole lot.\"    This was good advice, and the others lost no time in filling their  baseball caps with water, which they sprinkled over their shoulders  and the other portions of their baseball outfits. They also wet down  the bow and stern seats of the rowboat. Then they grabbed up their  oars and commenced to row up the lake, trying to get out of the range  of both the fire and the smoke.    \"Here is what the fire consists of,\" declared Fred presently, when he  caught a whisp of it on his arm. \"It's nothing but oil-soaked waste.  They must have had a whole lot of it at that plant, and one of the  explosions sent it high into the air and scattered it in every  direction.\"    The boys continued on their way for a few minutes, and then ran into  another cloud of smoke. This was of a peculiar bluish-green cast, and  seemed so sulphurous they were nearly choked by it.    \"Listen!\" burst out Andy. \"I think I heard somebody calling.\"    He held up one hand for silence, and all listened attentively. In  spite of the roaring of the flames, which were now devouring several  of the buildings at the shell-loading plant, and the continual popping  of some of the smaller shells, all heard a frantic cry for assistance.    \"It's somebody calling for help!\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"I think the cry came from over yonder,\" said Jack, in answer to the  latter question. \"Let's pull over there and see.\"    All were willing, and the four once more bent to their oars, sending  the rowboat through the bluish-green smoke, which almost choked and  blinded them.    \"Hello there!\" yelled Fred. \"Where are you?\"    \"Help! Help!\" came the cry from off to their left. \"Help! Save me!\"    The rowboat was turned in that direction, and a few seconds later the  Rover boys caught sight through the smoke of a water-logged rowboat to  which an elderly man, dressed in the garb of a workman, was clinging.    \"Help me! Help me! I can't hang on much longer!\" gasped the man, as  soon as he saw the boys.    \"Sure, we'll help you,\" declared Jack. \"Go slow now,\" he cautioned his  cousins. \"We don't want to knock him off into the water.\"    With care the rowboat was brought around so that they came up  alongside of the elderly man. He was glad enough to turn from his  water-logged craft to the other boat. But he was well-nigh exhausted,  and the Rovers had not a little trouble in getting him on board.    \"Tell you what--I'm mighty glad you lads came along,\" panted the old  man, when he was safe. \"I couldn't have held out much longer. This is  something terrible, ain't it? Say, would you mind hooking that boat  fast and pulling it to shore? It belongs to me, and I ain't so  wealthy that I can afford to lose it. Besides, it's got some of my  things in it.\"    \"We'll take it along unless it keeps us back too much,\" answered Jack.  And then he bent down, got hold of the bowline of the craft, and tied  it fast to their stern. Fortunately the other boat was a small one, so  they had not much difficulty in towing it along.    \"I'm a dockman over at the ammunition factory,\" explained the old man.  \"And when things began to go off I thought it was high time to get  out. I tried to save a few of my things and dumped 'em into my boat  and began to pull for the shore. But then one of the big explosions  went off, and I got caught in a lot of smoke and a rain of I don't  know what, and was nearly rendered senseless. When I came to, I had  drifted along to near where you found me. Something must have hit the  boat and gone through the bottom, for she was filling with water fast.  Then she tipped, and I went overboard. I can't swim very well, and  that confounded"]]]
