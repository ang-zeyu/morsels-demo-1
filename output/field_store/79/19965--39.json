It is reckoned from 0 deg. up to 360 deg., beginning at the north  point and passing around by east through south and west to north again.  Thus, if the angle of position is 0 deg. or 360 deg., the companion is on the  north side of the primary; if the angle is 90 deg., the companion is to the  east; if 180 deg., to the south; if 270 deg., to the west, and so for  intermediate angles. It must be remembered, however, that in the field  of the telescope the top is south and the bottom north, unless a prism  is used, when directions become complicated. East and west can be  readily identified by noticing the motion of a star through the field;  it moves toward the west and from the east.    Rigel has been suspected of a slight degree of variability. It is  evidently a star of enormous actual magnitude, for its parallax escapes  trustworthy measurement. It can only be ranked among the very first of  the light-givers of the visible universe. Spectroscopically it belongs  to a peculiar type which has very few representatives among the bright  stars, and which has been thus described: \"Spectra in which the hydrogen  lines and the few metallic lines all appear to be of equal breadth and  sharp definition.\" Rigel shows a line which some believe to represent  magnesium; but while it has iron lines in its spectrum, it exhibits no  evidence of the existence of any such cloud of volatilized iron as that  which helps to envelop the sun.    For another test of what the three-inch will do turn to zeta, the lower,  or left-hand, star in the Belt. This is a triple, the magnitudes being  second, sixth, and tenth. The sixth-magnitude star is about 2.5\" from  the primary, p. 149 deg., and has a very peculiar color, hard to describe.  It requires careful focusing to get a satisfactory view of this star  with a three-inch telescope. Use magnifying powers up to two hundred and  fifty diameters. With our four-inch the star is much easier, and the  five-inch shows it readily with a power of one hundred. The  tenth-magnitude companion is distant 56\", p. 8 deg., and may be glimpsed  with the three-inch. Upon the whole, we shall find that we get more  pleasing views of zeta Orionis with the four-inch glass.    Just to the left of zeta, and in the same field of view with a very low  power, is a remarkable nebula bearing the catalogue number 1227. We must  use our five-inch on this with a low power, but with zeta out of the  field in order to avoid its glare. The nebula is exceedingly faint, and  we can be satisfied if we see it simply as a hazy spot, although with  much larger telescopes it has appeared at least half a degree broad.  Tempel saw several centers of condensation in it, and traced three or  four broad nebulous streams, one of which decidedly suggested spiral  motion.    The upper star in the Belt, delta, is double; distance, 53\", p. 360 deg.;  magnitudes, second and seventh very nearly; colors, white and green or  blue. This, of course, is an easy object for the three-inch with a low  magnifying power. It would be useless to look for the two fainter  companions of delta, discovered by Burnham, even with our five-inch  glass. But we shall probably need the five-inch for our next attempt,  and it will be well to put on a high power, say three hundred diameters.  The star to be examined is the little brilliant dangling below the  right-hand end of the Belt, toward Rigel. It appears on the map as eta.  Spare no pains in getting an accurate focus, for here is something worth  looking at, and unless you have a trained eye you will not easily see  it. The star is double, magnitudes third and sixth, and the distance  from center to center barely exceeds 1\", p. 87 deg.. A little tremulousness  of the atmosphere for a moment conceals the smaller star, although its  presence is manifest from the peculiar jutting of light on one side of  the image of the primary. But in an instant the disturbing undulations  pass, the air steadies, the image shrinks and sharpens, and two points  of piercing brightness, almost touching one another, dart into sight,  the more brilliant one being surrounded by an evanescent circle, a tiny  ripple of light, which, as it runs round the star and then recedes,  alternately embraces and releases the smaller companion. The wash of the  light-waves in the atmosphere provokes many expressions of impatience  from the astronomer, but it is often a beautiful phenomenon  nevertheless.    Between eta and delta is a fifth-magnitude double star, Sigma 725, which  is worth a moment's attention. The primary, of a reddish color, has a  very faint star, eleventh magnitude, at a distance of 12.7\", p. 88 deg..    Still retaining the five-inch in use, we may next turn to the other end  of the Belt, where, just under zeta, we perceive the fourth-magnitude  star sigma. He must be a person of indifferent mind who, after looking  with unassisted eyes at the modest glimmering of this little star, can  see it as the telescope reveals it without a thrill of wonder and a cry  of pleasure. The glass, as by a touch of magic, changes it from one into  eight or ten stars. There are two quadruple sets three and a half  minutes of arc apart. The first set exhibits a variety of beautiful  colors. The largest star, of fourth magnitude, is pale gray; the second  in rank, seventh magnitude, distance 42\", p. 61 deg., presents a singular  red, \"grape-red\" Webb calls it; the third, eighth magnitude, distance  12\", p. 84 deg., is blue; and the fourth, eleventh magnitude, distance 12\",  p. 236 deg., is apparently white. Burnham has doubled the fourth-magnitude  star, distance 0.23\". The second group of four stars consists of three  of the eighth to ninth magnitude, arranged in a minute triangle with a  much fainter star near them. Between the two quadruple sets careful  gazing reveals two other very faint stars. While the five-inch gives a  more satisfactory view of this wonderful multiple star than any smaller  telescope can do, the four-inch and even the three-inch would have shown  it to us as a very beautiful object. However we look at them, there is  an appearance of association among these stars, shining with their  contrasted colors and their various degrees of brilliance, which is  significant of the diversity of conditions and circumstances under which  the suns and worlds beyond the solar walk exist.    From sigma let us drop down to see the wonders of Orion's Sword  displayed just beneath. We can use with advantage any one of our three  telescopes; but since we are going to look at a nebula, it is fortunate  that we have a glass so large as five inches aperture. It will reveal  interesting things that escape the smaller instruments, because it  grasps more than one and a half times as much light as the four-inch,  and nearly three times as much as the three-inch; and in dealing with  nebulae a plenty of light is the chief thing to be desired. The middle  star in the Sword is theta, and is surrounded by the celebrated Nebula  of Orion. The telescope shows theta separated into four stars arranged  at the corners of an irregular square, and shining in a black gap in the  nebula. These four stars are collectively named the Trapezium. The  brightest is of the sixth magnitude, the others are of the seventh,  seven and a half, and eighth magnitudes respectively. The radiant mist  about them has a faint greenish tinge, while the four stars, together  with three others at no great distance, which follow a fold of the  nebula like a row of buttons on a coat, always appear to me to show an  extraordinary liveliness of radiance, as if the strange haze served to  set them off.    [Illustration: THE TRAPEZIUM WITH THE FIFTH AND SIXTH STARS.]    Our three-inch would have shown the four stars of the Trapezium  perfectly well, and the four-inch would have revealed a fifth star, very  faint, outside a line joining the smallest of the four and its nearest  neighbor. But the five-inch goes a step farther and enables us, with  steady gazing to see even a sixth star, of only the twelfth magnitude,  just outside the Trapezium, near the brightest member of the quartet.  The Lick telescope has disclosed one or two other minute points of light  associated with the Trapezium. But more interesting than the Trapezium  is the vast cloud, full of strange shapes, surrounding it. Nowhere else  in the heavens is the architecture of a nebula so clearly displayed. It  is an unfinished temple whose gigantic dimensions, while exalting the  imagination, proclaim the omnipotence of its builder. But though  unfinished it is not abandoned. The work of creation is proceeding  within its precincts. There are stars apparently completed, shining like  gems just dropped from the hand of the polisher, and around them are  masses, eddies, currents, and swirls of nebulous matter yet to be  condensed, compacted, and constructed into suns. It is an education in  the nebular theory of the universe merely to look at this spot with a  good telescope. If we do not gaze at it long and wistfully, and return  to it many times with unflagging interest, we may be certain that there  is not the making of an astronomer in us.    Before quitting the Orion nebula do not fail to notice an  eighth-magnitude star, a short distance northeast of the Great Nebula,  and nearly opposite the broad opening in the latter that leads in toward  the gap occupied by the Trapezium. This star is plainly enveloped in  nebulosity, that is unquestionably connected with the larger mass of  which it appears to form a satellite.    At the lower end of the Sword is the star iota, somewhat under the third  magnitude. Our three-inch will show that it has a bluish companion of  seventh or eighth magnitude, at a little more than 11\" distance, p.  142 deg., and the larger apertures will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28764"],[0,"Getting Acquainted with the Trees (#5)"],[1,"I remember as providing a special interest in the Georgia forests, where  the long-leaved pine also gave a new tree sensation to the visitor from  the North, who at first could hardly imagine what those lovely little  green fountains of foliage were that he saw along the roadside and in  the woods. The Georgia oaks seem to me to have a richness of foliage, a  color and substance and shine, that compare only with the excellence of  two other products of the same State--the peach and the watermelon. The  long summer and the plenitude of sunshine seem to weave into these  products luxuriance found nowhere else; and when one sees for the first  time a happy, rollicking bunch of round-eyed negro children, innocent  alike of much clothing or any trouble, mixing up with the juicy Georgia  melon under the shade of a luxuriant oak, he gets a new conception of  at least one part of the race problem!    One of the things I wanted much to see when I first traveled South was  the famed live-oak, the majesty and the mournfulness of which had been  long sung into me. Perhaps I expected too much, as I did of the  palmetto, another part of my quest, but surely there was disappointment  when I was led, on the banks of the Manatee River in Florida, to see a  famous live-oak. It was tall and grand, but its adornment of long,  trailing gray Spanish moss, which was to have attached the sadness to  it, seemed merely to make it unkempt and uncomfortable. I was instantly  reminded of a tree at home in the far North that I had never thought  particularly beautiful, but which now, by comparison, took on an  attractiveness it has never since lost. Imagine a great spreading  weeping willow turned dingy gray, and you have a fair picture of a  moss-covered live-oak; but you will prefer it green, as is the willow, I  believe.    One day a walk about Savannah, which city has many splendid live-oaks  in its parks and squares, involved me in a sudden shower, when, presto!  the weeping willow of the North was reincarnated before my eyes, for the  falling rain turned the dingy moss pendants of the live-oak to the  whitish green that makes the willow such a delightful color-note in  early spring. I have been thankful often for that shower, for it gave a  better feeling about the live-oak, and made me admire the weeping  willow.    The live-oak, by the way, has a leaf very little like the typical  oak--it is elliptical in shape and smooth in outline. The curious  parasitic moss that so frequently covers the tree obscures the really  handsome foliage.    The English Oak, grand tree that it is, grows well in America, as  everything English should by right, and there are fine trees of this  _Quercus Robur_ on Long Island. The acorns are of unusual elegance, as  the photograph which shows them will prove.    The red oak, the black oak, the scarlet oak, all splendid forest trees  of the Northeast, are in the group of confusion that can be readily  separated only by the timber-cruiser, who knows every tree in the  forest for its economic value, or by the botanist, with his limp-bound  Gray's Manual in hand. I confess to bewilderment in five minutes after  the differences have been explained to me, and I enjoyed, not long ago,  the confusion of a skilful nurseryman who was endeavoring to show me his  young trees of red oak which the label proved to be scarlet! But the  splendidly effective trees themselves can be fully appreciated, and the  distinctions will appear as one studies carefully the features of these  living gifts of nature's greenness. The trees wait on one, and once the  habit of appreciation and investigation is formed, each walk afield, in  forest or park, leads to the acquirement of some new bit of tree-lore,  that becomes more precious and delightful as it is passed on and  commented upon in association with some other member of the happily  growing fraternity of nature-lovers.    [Illustration: Acorns of the English oak]    These oak notes are not intended to be complete, but only to suggest  some points for investigation and appreciation to my fellows in the  brotherhood. I have never walked between Trenton and New York, and  therefore never made the desired acquaintance with the scrub-oaks along  the way. Nor have I dipped as fully into the oak treasures of the Arnold  Arboretum as I want to some day. But my camera is yet available and the  trees are waiting; the tree love is growing and the tree friends are  inviting, and together we will add to the oak knowledge and to that  thankfulness for God and life and love and friends that the trees do  most constantly cause to flourish.          The Pines      In popular estimation, the pines seem to belong to the North, not quite  so exclusively as do the palms to the South. The ragged, picturesque old  pines, spruces and hemlocks of our remembrance carry with them the  thought of great endurance, long life and snowy forests. We think of  them, too, as belonging to the mountains, not to the plains; as clothing  steep slopes with their varied deep greens rather than as standing  against the sky-line of the sea. Yet I venture to think that the most of  us in the East see oftenest the pines peculiar to the lowlands, as we  flit from city to city over the steel highways of travel, and have most  to do, in an economical sense, with a pine that does not come north of  the Carolinas--the yellow pine which furnishes our familiar  house-flooring.    The pine family, as we discuss it, is not all pines, in exactitude--it  includes many diverse trees that the botanist describes as conifers.  These cone-bearing trees are nearly all evergreens--that is, the foliage  persists the year round, instead of being deciduous, as the  leaf-dropping maples, oaks, birches, and the like are scientifically  designated. Historically the pines are of hoary age, for they are  closely related to the growths that furnished the geologic coal measures  stored up in the foundations of the earth for our use now. Economically,  too, all the pine family together is of vast importance--\"the most  important order of forest trees in the economy of civilized man,\" says  Dr. Fernow; for, as he adds, the cone-bearing trees \"have furnished the  bulk of the material of which our civilization is built.\" As usual,  civilization has destroyed ruthlessly, thoughtlessly, almost viciously,  in using this material; wherefore the devastation of the forests, moving  them back from us farther and farther until in many regions they are but  a thin fringe, has left most of us totally unfamiliar with these trees,  of the utmost beauty as well as of the greatest value.    [Illustration: A lone pine on the Indian River]    To know anything at all of the spruces, pines and hemlocks is to love  them for the refreshment there is in their living presence, rather than  to consider them merely for the timber value. But the point of view  differs immensely with one's occupation. I remember finding in the  depths of an Alleghany forest a comparatively rare native orchid, then  new to me--the round-leaved _or orbicular habenaria_. While I was  gloating over it with my camera a gray-haired native of the neighborhood  joined me, and, to my surprise, assisted in the gloating--he, too, loved  the woods and the plants. Coming a little later to a group of  magnificent hemlocks, with great, clean, towering trunks reaching up a  hundred feet through the soft maples and yellow birches and beeches  which seemed dwarfed by these veterans, I exclaimed in admiration.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"them's mighty fine hemlocks. I calc'late thet one to  the left would bark near five dollars' wuth!\" On the rare plant we had  joined in esthetic appreciation, but the hemlock was to the old  lumberman but a source of tan-bark.    This search for tannin, by the way, is to blame for much wanton  destruction. Young hemlocks, from four to six inches in diameter, are  felled, stripped of their bark, and left cumbering the ground, to invite  fire and to make of the woods an unkempt cemetery. The fall of a tree  from natural causes is followed by the interesting and beauty-making  process of its mossy decay and return to the forest floor, furnishing in  the process nourishment for countless seedlings and plants. A tree  felled in maturity under enlightened forest management is all removed  for its timber, and leaves the ground clear; but the operations of the  bark-hunter leave only hideous destruction and a \"slash\" that is most  difficult to clear in later years.    This same hemlock makes a most impressive forest. To walk among primeval  hemlocks brings healing to the mind and peace to the soul, as one  realizes fully that \"the groves were God's first temples,\" and that God  is close to one in these beneficent solitudes, where petty things must  fall away, vexations cease, and man's spiritual nature absorb the  message of the forest.    [Illustration: Hemlock Hill, Arnold Arboretum (Boston)]    I wonder how many of my readers realize that an exquisite bit of real  hemlock forest lies not five miles from Boston Common? At the Arnold  Arboretum, that noble collection of trees and plants, \"Hemlock Hill\" is  assuming deeper majesty year after year as its trees gain age and size.  It presents exactly the pure forest conditions, and makes accessible to  thousands the full beauty and soothing that nothing but a coniferous  forest can provide for man. There is the great collateral advantage,  too, that to reach Hemlock Hill, the visitor must use a noble entrance,  and pass other trees and plants which, in the adequate setting here  given, cannot but do him much good, and prepare him for the deep sylvan  temple of the hemlocks he is seeking. To visit the Arboretum at the time  when the curious variety of the apple relatives--pyruses and the  like--bloom, is to secure a great benefit of sight and scent, and it is  almost certain to make one resolve to return when these blossoms shall,  by nature's"]]]
