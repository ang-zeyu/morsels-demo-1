Still the lancers did not  abandon the chase, and followed us for a long distance. From time to  time we could hear the pitiful cries and entreaties of burghers who  were being \"finished off,\" but we could see nothing. My man and I had  fleet horses in good condition, those of the pursuing lancers were big  and clumsy.    My adjutant, Piet Fourie, however, was not so fortunate as myself. He  was overtaken and made a prisoner. Revolvers were being promiscuously  fired at us, and at times the distance between us and our pursuers  grew smaller. We could plainly hear them shouting \"Stop, or I'll shoot  you,\" or \"Halt, you damned Boer, or I'll run my lance through your  blessed body.\"    We really had no time to take much notice of these pretty compliments.  It was a race for life and freedom. Looking round furtively once more  I could distinguish my pursuers; I could see their long assegais; I  could hear the snorting of their unwieldy horses, the clattering of  their swords. These unpleasant combinations were enough to strike  terror into the heart of any ordinary man.    Everything now depended upon the fleetness and staying power of my  sturdy little Boer pony, Blesman. He remained my faithful friend long  after he had got me out of this scrape; he was shot, poor little chap,  the day when they made me a prisoner. Poor Blesman, to you I owe my  life! Blesman was plainly in league against all that was British; from  the first he displayed Anglophobia of a most acute character. He has  served me in good stead, and now lies buried, faithful little heart,  in a Lydenburg ditch.    In my retreat Sunday River had to be crossed. It was deep, but deep or  not, we had to get through it. We were going at such a pace that we  nearly tumbled down the banks. The precipice must have been very  steep; all I remember is finding myself in the water with Blesman by  my side. The poor chap had got stuck with his four legs in the drift  sand. I managed to liberate him, and after a lot of scrambling and  struggling and wading through the four foot stream, I got to the other  side. On the opposite bank the British were still firing. I therefore  decided to lie low in the water, hoping to delude them into thinking I  was killed or drowned. My stratagem was successful. I heard one of my  pursuers say, \"We've finished him,\" and with a few more pyrotechnic  farewells they retraced their steps towards Ladysmith.    On the other side, however, more horsemen came in pursuit.  Unquestionably the British, fired by their splendid success, were  following up their victory with great vigour, and again I was  compelled to hide in the long grass into which my native servant, with  Ethiopian instinct, had already crept. While I was travelling along on  foot my man had rescued my horse from the muddy banks of the river.    When all was said and done I had escaped with a good wetting. Now for  Newcastle. I had still my rifle, revolver, and cartridges left to me;  my field-glass I had lost, probably in the river. Water there was  plenty, but food I had none. The track to Newcastle to a stranger,  such as I was in that part of the country, was difficult to discover.  To add to my perplexities I did not know what had happened at Dundee,  where I had been told a strong British garrison was in occupation.  Therefore, in straying in that direction I ran the risk of being  captured.    Finally, however, I came upon a kaffir kraal. I was curtly hailed in  the kaffir language, and upon my asking my swarthy friends to show me  the road, half a dozen natives, armed with assegais, appeared on the  scene. I clasped my revolver, as their attitude seemed suspicious.  After they had inspected me closely, one of the elders of the  community said: \"You is one of dem Boers vat runs avay? We look on and  you got dum dum to-day. Now we hold you, we take you English  magistrate near Ladysmith.\" But I know my kaffir, and I sized up this  black Englishman instantly. \"The fact is,\" I said, \"I'm trekking with  a commando of 500 men, and we are doing a bit of scouting round your  kraal. If you will show me the way to the Biggersbergen I will give  you 5s. on account.\" My amiable and dusky friend insisted on 7s. 6d.,  but after I had intimated that if he did not accept 5s. I should  certainly burn his entire outfit, slaughter all his women and kill all  his cattle, he acquiesced. A young Zulu was deputed as my guide, but I  had to use my fists and make pretty play with my revolver, and  generally hint at a sudden death, or he would have left me in the  lurch. He muttered to himself for some time, and suddenly terminated  his soliloquy by turning on his heels and disappearing in the  darkness.    The light of a lantern presently showed a railway station, which I  rightly guessed to be Waschbank. Here two Englishmen, probably railway  officials, came up to me, accompanied by my treacherous guide. The  latter had obviously been good enough to warn the officials at the  station of my approach, but luckily they were unarmed. One of them  said, \"You've lost your way, it appears,\" to which I replied, \"Oh, no,  indeed; I'm on the right track I think.\" \"But,\" he persisted, \"you  won't find any of your people here now; you've been cut to pieces at  Elandslaagte and Lukas Meyer's and Erasmus's forces round Dundee have  been crushed. You had better come along with me to Ladysmith. I  promise you decent treatment.\" I took care not to get in between them,  and, remaining at a little distance, said, revolver in hand, \"Thanks  very much, it's awfully good of you. I have no business to transact in  Ladysmith for the moment and will now continue my journey.  Good-night.\" \"No, no, no, wait a minute,\" returned the man who had  spoken first, \"you know you can't pass here.\" \"We shall see about  that,\" I said. They rushed upon me, but ere they could overpower me I  had levelled my revolver. The first speaker tried to disarm me, but I  shook him off and shot him. He fell, and as far I know, or could see,  was not fatally wounded. The other man, thinking discretion the better  part of valour, disappeared in the darkness, and my unfaithful guide  had edged away as soon as he saw the glint of my gun.    My adventures on that terrible night were, however, not to end with  this mild diversion. About an hour after daybreak, I came upon a barn  upon which the legend \"Post Office Savings Bank\" was inscribed. A big  Newfoundland dog lay on the threshold, and although he wagged his tail  in a not unfriendly manner, he did not seem disposed to take any  special notice of me. There was a passage between the barn and some  stables at the back and I went down to prospect the latter. What luck  if there had been a horse for me there! Of course I should only have  wanted to borrow it, but there was a big iron padlock on the door,  though inside the stables I heard the movements of an animal. A horse  meant to me just then considerably more than three kingdoms to King  Richard. For the first time in my life I did some delicate burglary  and housebreaking to boot. But the English declare that all is fair in  love and war, and they ought to know.    I discovered an iron bar, which enabled me to wrench off the lock from  the stable door, and, having got so far with my burglarious  performance, I entered cautiously, and I may say nervously. Creeping  up to the manger I fumbled about till I caught hold of a strap to  which the animal was tied, cut the strap through and led the horse  away. I was wondering why it went so slowly and that I had almost to  drag the poor creature along. Once outside I found to my utter disgust  that my spoil was a venerable and decrepit donkey. Disappointed and  disheartened, I abandoned my booty, leaving that ancient mule brooding  meditatively outside the stable door and clearly wondering why he had  been selected for a midnight excursion. But there was no time to  explain or apologise, and as the mule clearly could not carry me as  fast as my own legs, I left him to his meditations.    At dawn, when the first rays of the sun lit up the Biggersbergen in  all their grotesque beauty, I realised for the first time where I was,  and found that I was considerably more than 12 miles from  Elandslaagte, the fateful scene of yesterday. Tired out, half-starved  and as disconsolate as the donkey in the stable, I sat myself on an  anthill. For 24 hours I had been foodless, and was now quite  exhausted. I fell into a reverie; all the past day's adventures passed  graphically before my eyes as in a kaleidoscope; all the horrors and  carnage of the battle, the misery of my maimed comrades, who only  yesterday had answered the battle-cry full of vigour and youth, the  pathos of the dead who, cut down in the prime of their life and  buoyant health, lay yonder on the veldt, far away from wives and  daughters and friends for ever more.    While in a brown study on this anthill, 30 men on horseback suddenly  dashed up towards me from the direction of Elandslaagte. I threw myself  flat on my face, seeking the anthill as cover, prepared to sell my life  dearly should they prove to be Englishmen. As soon as they observed me  they halted, and sent one of their number up to me. Evidently they knew  not whether I was friend or foe, for they reconnoitred my prostrate form  behind the anthill with great circumspection and caution; but I speedily  recognised comrades-in-arms. I think the long tail which is peculiar to  the Basuto pony enabled me to identify them as such, and one friend, who  was their outpost, brought me a reserve horse, and what was even better,  had extracted from his saddle-bag a tin of welcome bully beef to stay  my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],[0,"The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#5)"],[1,"Whore your Health and Pence, Sir,    Your Daughter rob your Chest, Sir,    Your Wife may steal your Rest, Sir.

But this is all but picking,    With Rest, Pence, Chest and Chicken;    It ever was decreed, Sir,    If Lawyer's Hand is fee'd, Sir,      He steals your whole Estate.    The Lawyers are bitter Enemies to those in our Way. They don't care that  any body should get a clandestine Livelihood but themselves.      Enter _Polly_.    _Polly._ 'Twas only _Nimming Ned_. He brought in a Damask  Window-Curtain, a Hoop-Petticoat, a pair of Silver Candlesticks,  a Periwig, and one Silk Stocking, from the Fire that happen'd last  Night.    _Peachum._ There is not a Fellow that is cleverer in his way, and saves  more Goods out of the Fire than _Ned_. But now, _Polly_, to your Affair;  for Matters must not be left as they are. You are married then, it  seems?    _Polly._ Yes, Sir.    _Peachum._ And how do you propose to live, Child?    _Polly._ Like other Women, Sir, upon the Industry of my Husband.    _Mrs. Peachum._ What, is the Wench turn'd Fool? A Highwayman's Wife,  like a Soldier's, hath as little of his Pay, as of his Company.    _Peachum._ And had not you the common Views of a Gentlewoman in your  Marriage, _Polly_?    _Polly._ I don't know what you mean, Sir.    _Peachum._ Of a Jointure, and of being a Widow.    _Polly._ But I love him, Sir; how then could I have Thoughts of parting  with him?    _Peachum._ Parting with him! Why, this is the whole Scheme and Intention  of all Marriage-Articles. The comfortable Estate of Widow-hood, is the  only Hope that keeps up a Wife's Spirits. Where is the Woman who would  scruple to be a Wife, if she had it in her Power to be a Widow, whenever  she pleas'd? If you have any Views of this sort, _Polly_, I shall think  the Match not so very unreasonable.    _Polly._ How I dread to hear your Advice! Yet I must beg you to explain  yourself.    _Peachum._ Secure what he hath got, have him peach'd the next Sessions,  and then at once you are made a rich Widow.    _Polly._ What, murder the Man I love! The Blood runs cold at my Heart  with the very thought of it.    _Peachum._ Fie, _Polly_! What hath Murder to do in the Affair? Since the  thing sooner or later must happen, I dare say, the Captain himself would  like that we should get the Reward for his Death sooner than a Stranger.  Why, _Polly_, the Captain knows, that as 'tis his Employment to rob, so  'tis ours to take Robbers; every Man in his Business. So that there is  no Malice in the Case.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Ay, Husband, now you have nick'd the Matter. To have him  peach'd is the only thing could ever make me forgive her.      AIR XII. Now ponder well, ye Parents dear.    [Music]      _Polly._ O ponder well! be not severe;      So save a wretched Wife!    For on the Rope that hangs my Dear      Depends poor _Polly's_ Life.    _Mrs. Peachum._ But your Duty to your Parents, Hussy, obliges you to  hang him. What would many a Wife give for such an Opportunity!    _Polly._ What is a Jointure, what is Widow-hood to me? I know my Heart.  I cannot survive him.      AIR XIII. Le printems rapelle aux armes.

I hate thee  for being particular: Why, Wench, thou art a Shame to thy very Sex.    _Polly._ But hear me, Mother. --If you ever lov'd--    _Mrs. Peachum._ Those cursed Play-Books she reads have been her Ruin.  One Word more, Hussy, and I shall knock your Brains out, if you have  any.    _Peachum._ Keep out of the way, _Polly_, for fear of Mischief, and  consider of what is proposed to you.    _Mrs. Peachum._ Away, Hussy. Hang your Husband, and be dutiful.        [Exit _Polly_.      Re-enter _Polly_, and listens behind column.    _Mrs. Peachum._ The Thing, Husband, must and shall be done. For the sake  of Intelligence we must take other measures, and have him peached the  next Session without her Consent. If she will not know her Duty, we know  ours.    _Peachum._ But really, my Dear, it grieves one's Heart to take off a  great Man. When I consider his Personal Bravery, his fine Stratagem, how  much we have already got by him, and how much more we may get, methinks  I can't find in my Heart to have a hand in his Death. I wish you could  have made _Polly_ undertake it.    _Mrs. Peachum._ But in a Case of Necessity-- our own Lives are in  danger.    _Peachum._ Then, indeed, we must comply with the Customs of the World,  and make Gratitude give way to Interest. --He shall be taken off.    _Mrs. Peachum._ I'll undertake to manage _Polly_.    _Peachum._ And I'll prepare Matters for the _Old-Baily_.

The whole Circle are in  Tears! --even Butchers weep! --_Jack Ketch_ himself hesitates to perform  his Duty, and would be glad to lose his Fee, by a Reprieve.

Pray, Fair one, be kind--    [Music]        _Macheath._ My Heart was so free,      It rov'd like the Bee,    'Till _Polly_ my Passion requited;      I sipt each Flower,      I chang'd every Hour,    But here every Flower is united.    _Polly._ Were you sentenc'd to Transportation, sure, my Dear, you could  not leave me behind you-- could you?    _Macheath._ Is there any Power, any Force that could tear me from thee?  You might sooner tear a Pension out of the Hands of a Courtier, a Fee  from a Lawyer, a pretty Woman from a Looking-glass, or any Woman from  Quadrille. --But to tear me from thee is impossible!

[Music]      Were I laid on _Greenland's_ Coast,    And in my Arms embrac'd my Lass;    Warm amidst eternal Frost,    Too soon the Half Year's Night would pass.      _Polly._ Were I sold on _Indian_ Soil,    Soon as the burning Day was clos'd,    I could mock the sultry Toil    When on my Charmer's Breast repos'd.      _Macheath._ And I would love you all the Day,      _Polly._ Every Night would kiss and play,      _Macheath._ If with me you'd fondly stray      _Polly._ Over the Hills and far away.    _Polly._ Yes, I would go with thee. But oh! --how shall I speak it?  I must be torn from thee. We must part.    _Macheath._ How! Part!    _Polly._ We must, we must. --My Papa and Mama are set against thy Life.

But lest Death my Love should thwart,    And bring thee to the fatal Cart,    Thus I tear thee from my bleeding Heart!      Fly hence, and let me leave thee.    One Kiss and then-- one Kiss-- be gone-- farewel.    _Macheath._ My Hand, my Heart, my Dear, is so riveted to thine, that I  cannot unloose my Hold.    _Polly._ But my Papa may intercept thee, and then I should lose the very  glimmering of Hope. A few Weeks, perhaps, may reconcile us all. Shall  thy _Polly_ hear from thee?    _Macheath._ Must I then go?    _Polly._ And will not Absence change your Love?    _Macheath._ If you doubt it, let me stay-- and be hang'd.    _Polly._ O how I fear! how I tremble! --Go-- but when Safety will give  you leave, you will be sure to see me again; for 'till then _Polly_ is  wretched.
