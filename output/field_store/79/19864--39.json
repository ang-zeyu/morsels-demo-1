Below the Chapter came the twelve PETTY CANONS,  officers peculiar to St. Paul's and Hereford;[19] and there were over  fifty CHANTRY PRIESTS when suppressed. Besides their appointed daily  masses they would divide amongst them the annual masses called  _obits_, which amounted to about a hundred, and were expected to  assist the Petty Canons. They spent their extensive leisure after the  proverbial manner of idle and ignorant men. The VICARS CHORAL had  dwindled down to six by Colet's time, were no longer in priests'  orders, and eventually became laymen pure and simple. Space would fail  us to enumerate the remaining official and semi-official officers.  Among the latter were the twelve scribes, who sat in the nave for the  service of the illiterate public, and were sworn to do nothing  detrimental to the interests of the Chapter.    The Apostle's mass was sung the first thing in the morning, in earlier  days by a Vicar Choral, and subsequently by a Petty Canon; and next  came the two masses named after the Virgin and the Chapter, the  Cardinals taking the latter. The other daily services were the usual  Nocturns or Matins and the rest, ending with a combined evensong of  Vespers and Compline. We do not know how the old Use of St. Paul's  differed from that of Sarum. Besides the Conversion and Commemoration  of St. Paul, the Deposition (April 30th) and the Translation (November  14th) of St. Erkenwald were red-letter days when, before the peal was  sounded, the bells were rung two and two. On the eve of St. Nicholas  (December 5th), patron saint of children, the choristers elected  their boy bishop and his clerks. On St. John the Evangelist's Day  (December 27th) at evensong the newly elected boy bishop in pontifical  vestments, with his boy clerks in copes, walked in procession, and  after censing the altar of the Blessed Trinity returned and occupied  dignitaries' stalls, and any evicted dignitary had to take the boy's  place as thurifer or acolyte, the boy bishop giving the benediction.  The next day (Holy Innocents) this youth preached and took the earlier  part of the mass. These choir lads were trained to act mysteries and,  later on, stage plays.[20]       [Illustration: THE SHRINE AND ALTAR OF ST. ERKENWALD BEHIND THE     HIGH ALTAR.     _After Hollar._]    Each new Lord Mayor, accompanied by the Council, went in procession to  St. Thomas Acon, and from thence to the cathedral. He paid his  devotions at the tomb of Bishop William the Norman, in the nave, in  gratitude for privileges obtained from the Conqueror, and then at the  tomb of his predecessor, the Portreeve Gilbert Becket, father of  Thomas, in a little chapel in the churchyard. On Whitsunday and the  following Tuesday were great processions in which the Corporation  joined, as they did on seven other festivals. At Whitsuntide,  according to a sixteenth century account, a huge suspended censer was  swung along the nave, and the descent of the Holy Spirit illustrated  by the letting loose of a white pigeon. Those who are curious about  the shrines, and particularly of St. Erkenwald's, the scene of so many  reputed miracles of healing, and of the relics, which included a vase  believed to contain some hair, milk, and a garment of the Virgin, are  referred to Dugdale and other like works. Passing over _Te Deums_ for  victories like Agincourt and Obsequies for the dead--this latter a  source of income to the officers--we will close this chapter with the  wedding of Arthur, Prince of Wales, a lad of fifteen, to Catherine of  Aragon, in November, 1501. The next spring Arthur died, and the king  effected the betrothal of the widow of eighteen to his younger son  Henry, aged eleven. Seven years later Henry VII. died, and lay in  state at the cathedral.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] Tacitus, \"Annals,\" xiv. 33.

FROM THE ACCESSION OF DEAN COLET TO THE FIRE    (1505-1666).      With the Florentine studies of John Colet, remarks J.R. Green, a purer  Christianity awoke throughout Teutonic Europe. Born in 1466, a son of  a distinguished citizen who was twice Lord Mayor, after seven years at  Oxford he travelled with sufficient means to France and Italy, and  whether at home or abroad studied in particular Greek. \"The knowledge  of Greek seems to have had one almost exclusive end for him,\"[21]  continues Green; \"Greek was the key by which he could unlock the  Gospels and the New Testament.\" Discarding the traditional  mediaevalisms, his faith rested simply on a vivid realisation of the  Person of Christ; and whilst his active and lucid intellect exhibit  him in many lights, everything else was subordinate to his faith.  Returning to England, he lectured gratuitously at Oxford on St. Paul's  Epistles, and formed a friendship with Erasmus. So Erasmus became the  earnest pupil of an earnest master. Taking priests' orders, he was  appointed Dean of St. Paul's and Prebendary of Mora (1505), and  established a reputation as a preacher. In those days, and until  Wolsey as legate gave the preference to Westminster, the two Houses  held their sessions in the Chapter House and Nave of Old St. Paul's,  as the opening ceremony still reminds us. Preaching at the opening in  1512, he startled Convocation by declaring, \"All that is in the Church  is either the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, or the pride of  life.\" In vain his bishop, Richard Fitz-James, endeavoured to  establish a charge of heresy: the Primate Warham and young Henry  VIII. both admired and supported the Dean; and the Dean continued to  show his preference for the New Testament in the original Greek rather  than for the prevalent nonsense of the mediaeval schoolmen.       [Illustration: DEAN COLET.     _After the portrait in Holland's \"Heroologia,\" 1620._[22]]    Where the consent of his Chapter was necessary, Colet's efforts at  reform were obstructed. The profanation of the sacred building he  could not stop: buying, selling, and promenading in the nave continued  the order of the day. The Chapter would have nothing to do with his  new statutes, but elsewhere he was more successful. The Chancellor's  School was not in accordance with his views; and in spite of Bishop,  Chancellor, and Chapter, out of his own means he built ST. PAUL'S  SCHOOL, towards the east end of the churchyard, and endowed it;  and leaving his colleagues out in the cold, left the management to the  Mercers' Company. His theology was manifest in the image over the  gate. It was neither Erkenwald nor Uncumber: it was not the Virgin or  even St. Paul himself, but the Child Jesus with the simple and  pregnant inscription, \"Hear ye Him.\" The severity of his discipline,  although a Pauline parent or pupil would now resent it, was adapted to  those rough and hardy times, when people rose early and worked hard,  and when corporal punishment was general and often, and irrespective  of sex or age. William Lyly, an Oxford student who had studied in the  East, was his first high master. As the original St. Paul's School  became eventually absorbed in Colet's, this latter--now removed from  its old home to stately buildings on the Hammersmith Road, and  possessing (1899), as a high master, a worthy successor of  Lyly[23]--is in one sense a new foundation of Colet's, yet in another  is also a continuation of that venerable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25267"],[0,"Astronomy for Amateurs (#5)"],[1,"      And the waves that naught can check nor arrest            Sang, bowing the foam of their haughty crest...                Behold the Lord God--Jehovah!    The immortal poet of France was an astronomer. The author more than  once had the honor of conversing with him on the problems of the starry  sky--and reflected that astronomers might well be poets.    It is indeed difficult to resist a sense of profound emotion before the  abysses of infinite Space, when we behold the innumerable multitude of  worlds suspended above our heads. We feel in this solitary contemplation  of the Heavens that there is more in the Universe than tangible and  visible matter: that there are forces, laws, destinies. Our ants' brains  may know themselves microscopic, and yet recognize that there is  something greater than the Earth, the Heavens;--more absolute than the  Visible, the Invisible;--beyond the more or less vulgar affairs of life,  the sense of the True, the Good, the Beautiful. We feel that an immense  mystery broods over Nature,--over Being, over created things. And it is  here again that Astronomy surpasses all the other sciences, that it  becomes our sovereign teacher, that it is the _pharos_ of modern  philosophy.    O Night, mysterious, sublime, and infinite! withdrawing from our eyes  the veil spread above us by the light of day, giving back transparency  to the Heavens, showing us the prodigious reality, the shining casket of  the celestial diamonds, the innumerable stars that succeed each other  interminably in immeasurable space! Without Night we should know  nothing. Without it our eyes would never have divined the sidereal  population, our intellects would never have pierced the harmony of the  Heavens, and we should have remained the blind, deaf parasites of a  world isolated from the rest of the universe. O Sacred Night! If on the  one hand it rests upon the heights of Truth beyond the day's illusions,  on the other its invisible urns pour down a silent and tranquil peace, a  penetrating calm, upon our souls that weary of Life's fever. It makes us  forget the struggles, perfidies, intrigues, the miseries of the hours of  toil and noisy activity, all the conventionalities of civilization. Its  domain is that of rest and dreams. We love it for its peace and calm  tranquillity. We love it because it is true. We love it because it  places us in communication with the other worlds, because it gives us  the presage of Life, Universal and Eternal, because it brings us Hope,  because it proclaims us citizens of Heaven.          CHAPTER II    THE CONSTELLATIONS      In Chapter I we saw the Earth hanging in space, like a globe isolated on  all sides, and surrounded at vast distances by a multitude of stars.    These fiery orbs are suns like that which illuminates ourselves. They  shine by their own light. We know this for a fact, because they are so  far off that they could neither be illuminated by the Sun, nor, still  more, reflect his rays back upon us: and because, on the other hand, we  have been able to measure and analyze their light. Many of these distant  suns are simple and isolated; others are double, triple, or multiple;  others appear to be the centers of systems analogous to that which  gravitates round our own Sun, and of which we form part. But these  celestial tribes are situated at such remote distances from us that it  is impossible to distinguish all the individuals of each particular  family. The most delicate observations have only revealed a few of them.  We must content ourselves here with admiring the principals,--the  sun-stars,--prodigious globes, flaming torches, scattered profusely  through the firmament.    How, then, is one to distinguish them? How can they be readily found and  named? There are so many of them!    Do not fear; it is quite a simple matter. In studying the surface of the  Earth we make use of geographical maps on which the continents and seas  of which it consists are drawn with the utmost care. Each country of our  planet is subdivided into states, each of which has its proper name. We  shall pursue the same plan in regard to the Heavens, and it will be all  the easier since the Great Book of the Firmament is constantly open to  our gaze. Our globe, moreover, actually revolves upon itself so that we  read the whole in due sequence. Given a clear atmosphere, and a little  stimulus to the will from our love of truth and science, and the  geography of the Heavens, or \"uranography,\" will soon be as familiar to  us as the geography of our terrestrial atom.    On a beautiful summer's night, when we look toward the starry sky, we  are at first aware only of a number of shining specks. The stars seem to  be scattered almost accidentally through Space; they are so numerous and  so close to one another that it would appear rash to attempt to name  them separately. Yet some of the brighter ones particularly attract and  excite our attention. After a little observation we notice a certain  regularity in the arrangement of these distant suns, and take pleasure  in drawing imaginary figures round the celestial groups.    That is what the ancients did from a practical point of view. In order  to guide themselves across the trackless ocean, the earliest Phenician  navigators noted certain fixed bearings in the sky, by which they mapped  out their routes. In this way they discovered the position of the  immovable Pole, and acquired empire over the sea. The Chaldean pastors,  too, the nomad people of the East, invoked the Heavens to assist in  their migrations. They grouped the more brilliant of the stars into  Constellations with simple outlines, and gave to each of these celestial  provinces a name derived from mythology, history, or from the natural  kingdoms. It is impossible to determine the exact epoch of this  primitive celestial geography. The Centaur Chiron, Jason's tutor, was  reputed the first to divide the Heavens upon the sphere of the  Argonauts. But this origin is a little mythical! In the Bible we have  the Prophet Job, who names Orion, the Pleiades, and the Hyades, 3,300  years ago. The Babylonian Tables, and the hieroglyphs of Egypt, witness  to an astronomy that had made considerable advance even in those remote  epochs. Our actual constellations, which are doubtless of Babylonian  origin, appear to have been arranged in their present form by the  learned philosopher Eudoxus of Cnidus, about the year 360 B.C. Aratus  sang of them in a didactic poem toward 270. Hipparchus of Rhodes was the  first to note the astronomical positions with any precision, one hundred  and thirty years before our era. He classified the stars in order of  magnitude, according to their apparent brightness; and his catalogue,  preserved in the Almagest of Ptolemy, contains 1,122 stars distributed  into forty-eight Constellations.    The figures of the constellations, taken almost entirely from fable, are  visible only to the eyes of the imagination, and where the ancients  placed such and such a person or animal, we may see, with a little  good-will, anything we choose to fancy. There is nothing real about  these figures. And yet it is indispensable to be able to recognize the  constellations in order to find our way among the innumerable army of  the stars, and we shall commence this study with the description of the  most popular and best known of them all, the one that circles every  night through our Northern Heavens. Needless to name it; it is familiar  to every one. You have already exclaimed--the Great Bear!    This vast and splendid association of suns, which is also known as the  Chariot of David, the Plow or Charles's Wain, and the Dipper, is one of  the finest constellations in the Heavens, and one of the oldest--seeing  that the Chinese hailed it as the divinity of the North, over three  thousand years ago.    If any of my readers should happen to forget its position in the sky,  the following is a very simple expedient for finding it. Turn to the  North--that is, opposite to the point where the sun is to be found at  midday. Whatever the season of the year, day of the month, or hour of  the night, you will always see, high up in the firmament, seven  magnificent stars, arranged in a quadrilateral, followed by a tail, or  handle, of three stars. This magnificent constellation never sinks below  our horizon. Night and day it watches above us, turning in twenty-four  hours round a very famous star that we shall shortly become acquainted  with. In the figure of the Great Bear, the four stars of the  quadrilateral are found in the body, and the three at the extremity make  the tail. As David's Chariot, the four stars represent the wheels, and  the three others the horses.    Sometimes our ancestors called them the Seven Oxen, the \"oxen of the  celestial pastures,\" from which the word septentrion (_septem triones_,  seven oxen of labor) is derived. Some see a Plowshare; others more  familiarly call this figure the Dipper. As it rotates round the pole,  its outline varies with the different positions.    It is not easy to guess why this constellation should have been called  the Bear. Yet the name has had a certain influence. From the Greek word  _arctos_ (bear) has come arctic, and for its antithesis, antarctic. From  the Latin word _trio_ (ox of labor) has come septentrion, the seven  oxen. Etymology is not always logical. Is not the word \"venerate\"  derived from Venus?    In order to distinguish one star from another, the convention of  denoting them by the letters of the Greek Alphabet has been adopted, for  it would be impossible to give a name to each, so considerable is their  number.[3]    [alpha] and [beta] denote the front wheels of the Chariot generally  known as the \"pointers;\" [gamma] and [delta] the hind wheels; [epsilon],  [zeta], [eta] the three horses. All these stars are of the second order  of magnitude (the specific meaning of this expression will be explained  in"]]]
