In \"The Auk,\" of July, 1893, Mr. George K. Cherrie, of the Field Museum,  says of the Red-Rumped Tanager:    \"During my stay at Boruca and Palmar, (the last of February) the  breeding season was at its height, and I observed many of the Costa Rica  Red-Rumps nesting. In almost every instance where possible I collected  both parents of the nests, and in the majority of cases found the males  wearing the same dress as the females. In a few instances the male was  in mottled plumage, evidently just assuming the adult phase, and in a  lesser number of examples the male was in fully adult plumage--velvety  black and crimson red. From the above it is clear that the males begin  to breed before they attain fully adult plumage, and that they retain  the dress of the female until, at least, the beginning of the second  year.    \"While on this trip I had many proofs that, in spite of its rich  plumage, and being a bird of the tropics, it is well worthy to hold a  place of honor among the song birds. And if the bird chooses an early  hour and a secluded spot for expressing its happiness, the melody is  none the less delightful. At the little village of Buenos Aires, on the  Rio Grande of Terraba, I heard the song more frequently than at any  other point. Close by the ranch house at which we were staying, there  is a small stream bordered by low woods and underbrush, that formed a  favorite resort for the birds. Just below the ranch is a convenient spot  where we took our morning bath. I was always there just as the day was  breaking. On the opposite bank was a small open space in the brush  occupied by the limbs of a dead tree. On one of these branches, and  always the same one, was the spot chosen by a Red-rump to pour forth his  morning song. Some mornings I found him busy with his music when I  arrived, and again he would be a few minutes behind me. Sometimes he  would come from one direction, sometimes from another, but he always  alighted at the same spot and then lost no time in commencing his song.  While singing, the body was swayed to and fro, much after the manner of  a canary while singing. The song would last for perhaps half an hour,  and then away the singer would go. I have not enough musical ability to  describe the song, but will say that often I remained standing quietly  for a long time, only that I might listen to the music.\"          THE GOLDEN ORIOLE.      We find the Golden Oriole in America only. According to Mr. Nuttall, it  is migratory, appearing in considerable numbers in West Florida about  the middle of March. It is a good songster, and in a state of captivity  imitates various tunes.    This beautiful bird feeds on fruits and insects, and its nest is  constructed of blades of grass, wool, hair, fine strings, and various  vegetable fibers, which are so curiously interwoven as to confine and  sustain each other. The nest is usually suspended from a forked and  slender branch, in shape like a deep basin and generally lined with fine  feathers.    \"On arriving at their breeding locality they appear full of life and  activity, darting incessantly through the lofty branches of the tallest  trees, appearing and vanishing restlessly, flashing at intervals into  sight from amidst the tender waving foliage, and seem like living gems  intended to decorate the verdant garments of the fresh clad forest.\"    It is said these birds are so attached to their young that the female  has been taken and conveyed on her eggs, upon which with resolute and  fatal instinct she remained faithfully sitting until she expired.    An Indiana gentleman relates the following story:    \"When I was a boy living in the hilly country of Southern Indiana, I  remember very vividly the nesting of a pair of fine Orioles. There stood  in the barn yard a large and tall sugar tree with limbs within six or  eight feet of the ground.    \"At about thirty feet above the ground I discovered evidences of an  Oriole's nest. A few days later I noticed they had done considerably  more work, and that they were using horse hair, wool and fine strings.  This second visit seemed to create consternation in the minds of the  birds, who made a great deal of noise, apparently trying to frighten me  away. I went to the barn and got a bunch of horse hair and some wool,  and hung it on limbs near the nest. Then climbing up higher, I concealed  myself where I could watch the work. In less than five minutes they were  using the materials and chatted with evident pleasure over the abundant  supply at hand.    \"They appeared to have some knowledge of spinning, as they would take a  horse hair and seemingly wrap it with wool before placing it in position  on the nest.    \"I visited these birds almost daily, and shortly after the nest was  completed I noticed five little speckled eggs in it. The female was so  attached to the nest that I often rubbed her on the back and even lifted  her to look at the eggs.\"    [Illustration: GOLDEN ORIOLE.]          TESTIMONIALS.

It may be well to explain that in these appointments the Government does  not place the appropriation in the hands of the appointees, but simply  becomes a guaranty. The appointee provides his own funds. If, after  return, vouchers can be shown that the sum guaranteed has been spent  according to regulations, he is reimbursed in due course.    Here was at least a contrast from a rough Mississippi River boat and the  crude homes of an unsettled Western State, to the royal carriage waiting  to convey one to the apartments reserved in a palace, the elegance and  culture of a court, the precision of a congress of representatives of  the nations of the world. The questions of humanity discussed by them,  the meeting of friends of other days, the regal bearing of the royal  host and hostess, the last parting from the dear old Emperor of  ninety-two, and his tenderly spoken, \"It is the last time, good-by\"; the  loving and last farewell of the beloved Empress Augusta, the patron  saint of the Red Cross; Bismarck and Moltke, in review, each with his  Red Cross insignia; the cordial hand grasp and the farewell never  repeated--and all of this attention to and interest in a subject that  the country I had gone to represent scarcely realized had an existence  beyond the receiving of some second-hand clothing, misfit shoes, and a  little money sent by some one to some place, where something bad had  happened.    No one dreamed that it meant anything more, or that it needed anything  after this, and nothing more was done.    It is only now, after almost two decades and within the last three  months, that we commence to awaken and wonder, with a mingled national  and personal sense of indignation, why our American Red Cross is not as  rich and great as in other nations?    In February, 1888, occurred the Mt. Vernon, Ill., cyclone, cutting a  broad swath through one-half of the beautiful county-seat, tearing down  all heavy buildings, picking up the lighter ones and sweeping them  along like cardboard.    In three minutes the work of destruction was over. Ten minutes later the  sun shone out brightly over the ruins of the town, the wails of the  maimed and dying, and the lifeless bodies of the dead.    Fires broke out on every hand, and the victims pinned down under the  wreckage were subjects for the flames. Appeals for assistance went out,  but by unfortunate press representation failed to arouse the public,  till after several days, when we were reached, through their  representative in Congress, begging that in mercy we go to them. We  arrived in the night, found homes destroyed, hospitals full, scant  medical care, few nurses, food scarce and no money, a relief committee  of excellent men, but little to distribute.    At daylight we looked over the situation and sent this simple message to  the Associated Press:      \"The pitiless snow is falling on the heads of three thousand people, who  are without homes, without food or clothing, and without money.    \"AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS,    \"Clara Barton, President.\"      This was all. We assisted their relief committee to arrange for the  receipt and distribution of funds, sent for experienced helpers to take  charge of supplies, to distribute clothing, and aid the hospital  service. We remained two weeks, and left them with more supplies than  they knew how to distribute, and the Citizens' Committee, with  accumulating cash in its treasury of ninety thousand dollars, full of  hope, life, and a gratitude they could not speak.    As in the Texas famine, we paid our own expenses and no dollar but our  own had passed our hands. We were only glad to do this, in the hope that  we were building up an institution of self-help of the people, that  would one day win its way to their favor and aid.          III    YELLOW FEVER IN FLORIDA      During the same year the yellow fever broke out in Jacksonville, Fla.,  and was declared epidemic in September.    An arrangement had been made between the National Association and the  Auxiliary Society of the Red Cross of New Orleans, which society  embraced the famous old \"Howard Association,\" that, in case of an  outbreak of yellow fever, they would send their immune nurses from the  South, and we of the North would supply the money to support and pay  them.    This arrangement was carried out so far as could be, under the very  natural differences of a medical department of active, professional men,  taking up the treatment of an epidemic of which they knew very little  experimentally, but filled with the enthusiasm of science and hope, and  the unprofessional, fearless, easy-going gait of the old Southern  nurses, white and black, whose whole lives had been spent in just that  work.    The Red Cross sent no Northern nurses. But eighteen or twenty \"Howard  nurses,\" mainly colored, went out from New Orleans under charge of Col.  Fred. F. Southmayd, their leader of twenty years in epidemics. A part of  his nurses were stationed at Macclenny, and a part went on to  Jacksonville. Under medical direction of their noted \"yellow fever  doctor\"--a tall Norwegian--Dr. Gill, they did their faithful work and  won their meed of grateful praise.    Our place was in Washington, to receive, deal carefully with, and hold  back the tide of offered service from the hundreds of enthusiastic,  excited untrained volunteers, rushing on to danger and death. Their  fearless ignorance was a pitiful lesson. In all the hundreds there was  scarcely one who had ever seen a case of yellow fever, but all were sure  they were proof against it. Only three passed us, and two of these had  the fever in Jacksonville.    When the scourge was ended we met our nurses personally at Camp Perry,  paid and sent them back to New Orleans. All that are living are at our  service still, faithful and true.    During the fourth week in November a dispatch to national headquarters  announced that the last band of Red Cross nurses, known as the  \"Macclenny Nurses,\" had finished their work at Enterprise, and would  come into Camp Perry to wait their ten days' quarantine and go home to  New Orleans for Thanksgiving.    That would mean that seventy-nine days ago their little company of  eighteen, mainly women, steaming on to Jacksonville, under guidance of  their old-time trusted leader, Southmayd, of New Orleans, listened to  his announcement that the town of Macclenny, thirty-eight miles from  Jacksonville, Fla., and through which they would soon pass, was in a  fearful state of distress; a comparatively new town, of a few thousand,  largely Northern and Western people, suddenly-stricken down in scores;  poor, helpless, physicians all ill, and no nurses; quarantined on all  sides, no food, medicine, nor comforts for sick or well.    \"Nurses, shall I leave a part of you there; the train can not stop in,  nor near the town, but if I can manage to get it slowed up somewhere,  will you jump?\"    \"We will do anything you say, colonel; we are here in God's name and  service to help His people; for Him, for you, and for the Red Cross, we  will do our best and our all.\"    \"Conductor, you had a hot box a few miles back; don't you think it  should be looked to after passing Macclenny?\"    \"I will slow up and have it seen to, colonel, although it may cost me my  official head.\" And it did.    One mile beyond town, the rain pouring in torrents, the ground soaked,  slippery, and caving, out into pitchy darkness, leaped three men and  seven women from a puffing, unsteady train, no physician with them, and  no instructions save the charge of their leader as the last leap was  made, and the train pushed on: \"Nurses, you know what to do; go and do  your best, and God help you.\" Hand to hand, that none go astray in the  darkness, they hobbled back over a mile of slippery cross-ties to the  stricken town. Shelter was found, the wet clothes dried, and at midnight  the sick had been parceled out, each nurse had his or her quota of  patients, and were in for the issue, be it life or death. Those past  all help must be seen through, and lost, all that could be must be  saved. The next day a dispatch from Southmayd went back to New Orleans  for Dr. Gill to come and take charge of the sick and the nurses at  Macclenny. It was done, and under his wise direction they found again a  leader. Their labors and successes are matters for later and more  extended record.    It is to be borne in mind that these nurses found no general table, no  table at all but such as they could provide, find the food for, and cook  for themselves, for the sick, the children, and the old and helpless who  had escaped the fever and must be cared for. No patient could be left  till the crisis was passed, and many are their records of seventy-two  hours without change or sleep or scarcely sitting down. As the disease  gradually succumbed to their watchful care, experience, and skill, they  reached out to other freshly attacked towns and hamlets. Sanderson and  Glen St. Mary's became their charge, and return their blessings for  lives preserved.    On November 1st it was thought they could safely leave and go into camp  for quarantine; but no regular train would be permitted to take them.  The Red Cross secured and paid a special train for them, and, as if in  bold relief against the manner of their entry seven weeks before, the  entire town, saving its invalids, was assembled at the station at seven  o'clock in the morning to bid them good-by and God speed.    But their fame had gone before them, and \"Enterprise,\" a hundred miles  below, just stricken down among its flowers and fruits, reached out its  hands for aid, and with one accord, after two days in camp, all turned  back from the coveted home and needed rest and added another month of  toil to their already weary record. At length this was ended, and word  came again to us that they would go into"]]]
