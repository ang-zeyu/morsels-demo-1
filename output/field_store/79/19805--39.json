At sight of the stranger Lass growled and  showed her teeth. For a collie mother will let nobody but proven  friends come near to her newborn brood.    The foreman stared at the hostile young mother for a half-minute,  whistling bewilderedly between his teeth. Then he laughed aloud.    \"That's no more Rothsay Princess than I am!\" he declared. \"I know who  she IS, though. I'd remember that funny mask among a million. That's  Rothsay Lass! Though how she got HERE--!    \"We couldn't have shipped her by mistake, either,\" he went on,  confused. \"For we'd sold her, that same day, to a kid in our town. I  ought to know. Because the kid kept on pestering us every day for a  month afterward, to find if she had come back to us. He said she ran  away in the night. He still comes around, once a week or so, to ask. A  spindly, weak, sick-looking little chap, he is. I don't get the point  of this thing, from any angle. But we run our kennels on the square.  And I can promise the boss'll either send back your check or send  Rothsay Princess to you and take Lass back.\"    Two days later, while all The Place was still mulling over the mystery,  a letter came for the Master from Lass's home town. It was signed  \"Edw'd Hazen,\" and it was written on the cheap stationery of his  employer's bottling works. It read:    Dear Sir:    \"Six months ago, my son bought a dog from the Rothsay Kennels. It was a  she-dog, and his ma and I didn't want one around. So I put it aboard a  freight-car on the sly. My boy went sick over losing his dog. He has  never rightly got over it, but he peaks and mopes and gets thinner all  the time. If I had known how hard he was going to take it, I would of  cut off my hand before I would of done such a thing. And my wife feels  just like I do about it. We would both of us have given a hundred  dollars to get the dog back for him, when we saw how bad he felt. But  it was too late. Somehow or other it is most generally too late when a  rotten thing has been done.    \"To-day he went again to the Rothsay Kennels to ask if she had come  back. He has always been hoping she would. And they told him you have  her. Now, sir, I am a poor man, but if one hundred dollars will make  you sell me that dog, I'll send it to you in a money order by return  mail. It will be worth ten times that much, to my wife and me, to have  Dick happy again. I inclose a stamp. Will you let me know?\"    Six weeks afterward The Place's car brought Dick Hazen across to  receive his long-lost pet.    The boy was thinner and shakier and whiter than when he had gone to  sleep with his cherished puppy curled against his narrow chest. But  there was a light in his eyes and an eagerness in his heart that had  not been there in many a long week.    Lass was on the veranda to welcome him. And as Dick scrambled out of  the car and ran to pick her up, she came more than half-way to meet  him. With a flurry of fast-pattering steps and a bark of eager welcome,  she flung herself upon her long-vanished master. For a highbred collie  does not forget. And at first glimpse of the boy Lass remembered him.    Dick caught her up in his arms--a harder feat than of yore, because of  her greater weight and his own sapped strength,--and hugged her tight  to his breast. Winking very fast indeed to disperse tears that had no  place in the eyes of a self-contained man of twelve, he sputtered  rapturously:    \"I KNEW I'd find you, Lassie--I knew it all the time;--even the times  when I was deadsure I wouldn't! Gee, but you've grown, though! And  you're beautifuler than ever. Isn't she, Miss?\" he demanded, turning to  the Mistress with instinctive knowledge that here at least he would  find confirmation. \"Indeed she is!\" the Mistress assured him.    \"And see how glad she is to be with you again! She--\"    \"And Dad says she can stay with me, for keeps!\" exulted Dick. \"He says  he'll put a new lock on the cellar door, so she can't ever push out  again, the way she did, last time. But I guess she's had her lesson in  going out for walks at night and not being able to find her way back.  She and I are going to have the dandiest times together, that ever  happened. Aren't we, Lass? Is that her little boy?\" he broke off, in  eager curiosity, as the Master appeared from the kennels, carrying  Bruce.    The puppy was set down on the veranda floor for Dick's inspection.    \"He's cunning, isn't he? Kind of like a Teddy Bear,--the sort kids play  with. But,\" with a tinge of worry, \"I'm not sure Ma will let me keep  two. Maybe--\"    \"Perhaps,\" suggested the Mistress, \"perhaps you'd like us to keep  little Bruce, to remember Lass by? We'll try to make him very happy.\"    \"Yes'm!\" agreed Dick, in much haste, his brow clearing from a mental  vision of Mrs. Hazen's face when she should see him return with twice  as many dogs as he had set out for. \"Yes'm. If you wouldn't mind, very  much. S'pose we leave it that way? I guess Bruce'll like being with  you, Miss. I--I guess pretty near anybody would. You'll--you'll try not  to be too homesick for Lass, won't you?\"    On the steps of the veranda the downy and fat puppy watched his  mother's departure with no especial interest. By the Mistress's wish,  Mr. Hazen had not been required to make any part of his proffered  hundred-dollar payment for the return of his boy's pet. All the  Mistress had stipulated was that Lass might be allowed to remain at The  Place until baby Bruce should no longer need her.    \"Bruce,\" said the Mistress as the car rolled up the drive and out of  sight, \"you are the sole visible result of The Place's experiment in  raising prize collies. You have a tremendous responsibility on those  fat little shoulders of yours,--to live up to it all.\"    By way of showing his scorn for such trifles as a \"tremendous  responsibility,\" Bruce proceeded to make a ferocious onslaught at the  Mistress's temperamental gray Persian kitten, \"Tipperary,\" which was  picking a mincing way across the veranda.    A howl of pain and two scratches on his tiny nose immediately followed  the attack. Tipperary then went on with her mincing promenade. And  Bruce, with loud lamentations, galloped to the shelter of the  Mistress's skirt.    \"Poor little chap!\" soothed the Mistress, picking him up and comforting  him. \"Responsibility isn't such a joke, after all, is it, Baby?\"        CHAPTER II. The Pest    Thackeray, as a lad, was dropped from college for laziness and for  gambling. Bismarck failed to get a University degree, because he lacked  power to study and because he preferred midnight beer to midnight oil.  George Washington, in student days, could never grasp the simplest  rules of spelling. The young Lincoln loved to sprawl in the shade with  fish-pole or tattered book, when he should have been working.    Now, these men were giants--physically as well as mentally. Being  giants, they were by nature slow of development.    The kitten, at six months of age, is graceful and compact and of  perfect poise. The lion-cub, at the same age, is a gawky and foolish  and ill-knit mass of legs and fur; deficient in sense and in symmetry.  Yet at six years, the lion and the cat are not to be compared for power  or beauty or majesty or brain, or along any other lines.    The foregoing is not an essay on the slow development of the Great. It  is merely a condensation of the Mistress's earnest arguments against  the selling or giving away of a certain hopelessly awkward and  senseless and altogether undesirable collie pup named Bruce.    From the very first, the Mistress had been Bruce's champion at The  Place. There was no competition for that office. She and she alone  could see any promise in the shambling youngster.    Because he had been born on The Place, and because he was the only son  of Rothsay Lass, whom the Mistress had also championed against strong  opposition, it had been decided to keep and raise him. But daily this  decision seemed less and less worth while. Only the Mistress's  championing of the Undesirable prevented his early banishment.    From a fuzzy and adventurous fluff-ball of gray-gold-and-white fur,  Bruce swiftly developed into a lanky giant. He was almost as large  again as is the average collie pup of his age; but, big as he was, his  legs and feet and head were huge, out of all proportion to the rest of  him. The head did not bother him. Being hampered by no weight of brain,  it would be navigated with more or less ease, in spite of its bulk. But  the legs and feet were not only in his own way, but in every one else's.    He seemed totally lacking in sense, as well as in bodily coordination.  He was forever getting into needless trouble. He was a stormcenter. No  one but a born fool--canine or human--could possibly have caused  one-tenth as much bother.    The Mistress had named him \"Bruce,\" after the stately Scottish  chieftain who was her history-hero. And she still called him  Bruce--fifty times a day--in the weary hope of teaching him his name.  But every one else on The Place gave him a title instead of a name--a  title that stuck: \"The Pest.\" He spent twenty-four hours, daily, living  up to it.    Compared with Bruce's helplessly clownish trouble-seeking propensities,  Charlie Chaplin's screen exploits are miracles of heroic dignity and of  good luck.    There was a little artificial water-lily pool on The Place, perhaps  four feet deep. By actual count, Bruce fell into it no less than nine  times in a single week. Once or twice he had nearly drowned there  before some member of the family chanced to fish him out. And, learning  nothing from experience, he would fall in again, promptly, the next day.    The Master at last rigged up a sort of sloping wooden platform, running  from the lip of the pool into the water, so that Bruce could crawl out  easily, next time he should tumble in. Bruce watched the placing of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#5)"],[1,"eyes were bloodshot. From the mouth and the hanging dewlaps, flecks  of foam dropped now and then to the ground.    The big mongrel was sick of mind and of body. He craved only to get out  of that abode of men and to find solitude in the forests and hills  beyond the village.    For this is the considerate way of dogs; and of cats as well. When dire  sickness smites them, they do not hang about, craving sympathy and  calling for endless attention. All they want is to get out of the  way,--well out of the way, into the woods and swamps and mountains;  where they may wrestle with their life-or-death problem in their own  primitive manner; and where, if need be, they may die alone and  peacefully, without troubling anyone else.    Especially is this true with dogs. If their malady is likely to affect  the brain and to turn them savage, they make every possible attempt to  escape from home and to be as far away from their masters as may be,  before the crisis shall goad them into attacking those they love.    And, when some such suffering beast is seen, on his way to solitude, we  humans prove our humanity by raising the idiotic bellow of \"Mad dog!\"  and by chasing and torturing the victim. All this, despite proof that  not one sick dog in a thousand, thus assailed, has any disease which is  even remotely akin to rabies.    Next to vivisection, no crime against helpless animals is so needlessly  and foolishly cruel as the average mad-dog chase.    Which is a digression; but which may or may not enable you to keep your  head, next time a mad-dog scare sweeps your own neighborhood.    Down the middle of the dusty street trotted the sick mongrel. Five  minutes earlier, he had escaped from the damp cellar in which his owner  had imprisoned him when first he fell ill. And now, his one purpose was  to leave the village behind him and to gain the leafy refuge of the  foothills beyond.    Out from a door-yard, flashed a bumptious little fox terrier. Into the  roadway he bounded; intent on challenging the bigger animal.    He barked ferociously; then danced in front of the invalid; yapping and  snapping up at the hanging head. The big mongrel, in agony, snarled and  made a lunge at his irritatingly dancing tormentor. His teeth dug  grazingly into the terrier's withers; and, with an impatient toss, he  flung the little beast to one side. Then he continued his interrupted  flight; sick wrath beginning to encompass his reeling brain, at the  annoyance he had encountered.    The yell of the slightly hurt terrier brought people to their doors.  The sound disturbed a half-breed spaniel from his doze in the dust, and  sent him out to continue the harrying his injured terrier chum had  begun.    The spaniel flew at the black dog; nipping at the plodding forepaws.  The mongrel raged; as might some painfully sick human who is pestered  when he asks only to be let alone. His dull apathy gave place to sullen  anger. He bit growlingly at the spaniel, throwing himself to one side  in pursuit of the elusive foe. And he snapped with equal rage at an  Irish terrier that had come out to add to the turmoil.    By this time, a score of people were dancing up and down inside their  door-yard fences, squalling \"Mad dog!\" and flinging at the black brute  any missile they could lay hand to.    A broken flower-pot cut the invalid's nose. A stone rebounded from his  ribs. The raucous human yells completed the work the first dog had  started. From a mere sufferer, the black mongrel had changed into a  peril.    The Mistress had motored over to the Hampton post-office, that  afternoon, to mail some letters. Lad, as usual, had gone with her. She  had left him in the car, while she went into the post-office.    Lad lay there, in snug contentment, on the car's front seat; awaiting  the return of his deity and keeping a watchful eye on anyone who  chanced to loiter near the machine. Presently, he sat up. Leaning out,  from one side of the seat, he stared down the hot roadway, in a  direction whence a babel of highly exciting sounds began to issue.    Apparently, beyond that kick-up of dust, a furlong below, all sorts of  interesting things were happening. Lad's soft eyes took on a glint of  eager curiosity; and he sniffed the still air for further clues as to  the nature of the fun. A number of humans,--to judge by the  racket,--were shouting and screaming; and the well-understood word,  \"dog,\" formed a large part of their clamor. Also, there were real dogs  mixed up in the fracas; and more than one of them had blood on him. So  much the collie's uncanny senses of smell and of hearing told him.    Lad whimpered, far down in his throat. He had been left here to guard  this car. It was his duty to stay where he was, until the Mistress  should return. Yet, right behind him, there, a series of mighty  entertaining things were happening,--things that he longed to  investigate and to mix into. It was hard to do one's solemn duty as  watchdog, when so much of wild interest was astir! Not once did it  occur to Laddie to desert his post. But he could not forbear that low  whimper and a glance of appeal toward the post-office.    And now, out of the smear of flying dust, loomed a lurching black  shape;--gigantic, terrible. It was coming straight toward the car;  still almost in mid-road. Behind, less distinct, appeared running men.  And a shot was fired. Somebody had run indoors for a pistol, before  joining the chase. The same somebody, in the van of the pursuers, had  opened fire; and was in danger of doing far more damage to life than  could a dozen allegedly mad dogs.    Just then, out from the post-office, came the Mistress. Crossing the  narrow sidewalk, she neared the car. Lad stood up, wagging his plumed  tail in welcome; his tiny white forepaws dancing a jig of eagerness on  the leather seat-cushion.    On reeled the black mongrel; crazed by noise and pain. His bleared eyes  caught a flash of the Mistress's white dress, on the walk, fifteen feet  in front of him and a yard or more to one side.    In a frame of mind when every newcomer was a probable tormenter, the  mongrel resolved to meet this white-clad foe, head-on. He swerved, with  a stagger, from his bee-line of travel; growled hideously, and sprang  full at her.    The Mistress paused, for an instant, in the middle of the sidewalk, to  find out the reason for the sudden din that had assailed her ears as  she emerged from the post-office. In that brief moment, she caught the  multiple-bellowed phrase of \"Mad dog!\" and saw the black brute charging  down upon her.    There was no time to dart back into the shelter of the building or to  gain the lesser safety of the car. For the charging mongrel was not  five feet away.    The Mistress stood stock-still; holding her hands at a level with her  throat. She did not cry out; nor faint. That was not the Mistress's  way. Like Lad, she was thoroughbred in soul as well as in body. And  neither she nor her dog belonged to the breed of screamers. Through her  mind, in that briefest fraction of a second whizzed the consoling  thought:    \"He's not mad, whatever else he is. A mad dog never swerves from his  path.\"    But if the Mistress remained moveless, Lad did not. Seeing her peril  even more swiftly than did she, he made one lightning dive from his  perch on the car seat.    He did not leap at random. Lad's brain always worked more quickly than  did his lithe body; flyingly rapid as were that body's motions. As he  gathered himself for the spring, his campaign was mapped out.    Down upon the charging beast swooped a furry whirlwind of burnished  mahogany-and-snow. Down it swooped with the whirring speed and unerring  aim of an eagle. Sixty-odd pounds of sinewy weight smote the lunging  mongrel, obliquely, on the left shoulder; knocking the great brute's  legs from under him and throwing him completely off his balance. Into  the dust crashed the two dogs; Lad on top. Before they struck ground,  the collie's teeth had found their goal ire the side of the larger  dog's throat; and every whalebone muscle in Lad's body was braced to  hold his enemy down.    It was a clever hold. For the fall had thrown the mongrel on his side.  And so long as Lad should be able to keep the great foaming head in  that sideways posture, the other dog could not get his feet under him  again. With his legs in their present position, he had no power to get  up; but lay thrashing and snapping and snarling; and trying with all  his cramped might to free himself from the muscular grip that held him  prostrate.    It was all over in something like two seconds. Up stormed the crowd;  the pistol-wielder at its head. Three shots were fired at point-blank  range. By some miracle none of them harmed Lad; although one bullet  scratched his foreleg on its way to the black giant's brain.    As soon as she could, the Mistress got herself and the loudly-praised  Lad into the car and set off for home. Now that the peril was over, she  felt dizzy and ill. She had seen what it is not well to see. And the  memory of it haunted her for many a night thereafter.    As for Lad, he was still atingle with excitement. The noisy praise of  those babbling humans had bothered him; and he had been glad to escape  it. Lad hated to be mauled or talked to by strangers. But the  Mistress's tremulous squeeze and her shuddering whisper of \"Oh, Laddie!  LADDIE!\" had shown she was proud of him. And this flattered and  delighted Lad, past all measure.    He had acted on impulse. But, from the Mistress's manner, he saw he had  made a wonderful hit with her by what he had done. And his tail thumped  ecstatically against the seat as he cuddled very close to her side.    At home, there was more praise and petting;--this time from both the  Mistress and the Master. And the Master bathed and patched the  insignificant bullet-scratch on the collie's foreleg. Altogether, it  was a gala afternoon for the young dog. And he"]]]
