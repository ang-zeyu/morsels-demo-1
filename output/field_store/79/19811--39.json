'You will be haunted,' resumed the Ghost, 'by Three Spirits.'    Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.    'Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?' he demanded in a  faltering voice.    'It is.'    'I--I think I'd rather not,' said Scrooge.    'Without their visits,' said the Ghost, 'you cannot hope to shun the  path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.'    'Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?' hinted  Scrooge.    'Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon  the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.  Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember  what has passed between us!'    When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the  table, and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the  smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the  bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural  visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over  and about its arm.    [Illustration: _The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and  thither in restless haste and moaning as they went_]    The apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the  window raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it  was wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they  were within two paces of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand,  warning him to come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.    Not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for, on the raising of  the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent  sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and  self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in  the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.    Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked  out.    The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in  restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains  like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were  linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to  Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in  a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who  cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an  infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was  clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and  had lost the power for ever.    Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he  could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and  the night became as it had been when he walked home.    Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had  entered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,  and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say 'Humbug!' but stopped at  the first syllable. And being, from the emotions he had undergone, or  the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the  dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in  need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep  upon the instant.    [Illustration]      STAVE TWO    [Illustration]          THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS      When Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could  scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his  chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret  eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.  So he listened for the hour.    To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and  from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!  It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must  have got into the works. Twelve!    He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous  clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.    'Why, it isn't possible,' said Scrooge, 'that I can have slept through a  whole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything  has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!'    The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his  way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve  of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very  little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and  extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and  fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if  night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This  was a great relief, because 'Three days after sight of this First of  Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,' and so forth, would  have become a mere United States security if there were no days to count  by.    Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over  and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more  perplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he  thought.    Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within  himself, after mature inquiry that it was all a dream, his mind flew  back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and  presented the same problem to be worked all through, 'Was it a dream or  not?'    Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more,  when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a  visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the  hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than  go to heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power.    The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must  have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it  broke upon his listening ear.    'Ding, dong!'    'A quarter past,' said Scrooge, counting.    'Ding, dong!'    'Half past,' said Scrooge.    'Ding, dong!'    'A quarter to it.' said Scrooge.    'Ding, dong!'    'The hour itself,' said Scrooge triumphantly, 'and nothing else!'    He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep,  dull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the  instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.    The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not  the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to  which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside;  and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself  face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as  I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.    It was a strange figure--like a child; yet not so like a child as like  an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the  appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a  child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its  back, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in  it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were very long and  muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength.  Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper  members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist  was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held a  branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction  of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But  the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there  sprang a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and  which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a  great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.    Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness,  was _not_ its strangest quality. For, as its belt sparkled and  glittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was light one  instant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its  distinctness; being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with  twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a  body: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense  gloom wherein they melted away. And, in the very wonder of this, it  would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever.    'Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?' asked  Scrooge.    'I am!'    The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if, instead of being  so close behind him, it were at a distance.    'Who and what are you?' Scrooge demanded.    'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.'    'Long Past?' inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.    'No. Your past.'    Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have  asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap,  and begged him to be covered.    'What!' exclaimed the Ghost, 'would you so soon put out, with worldly  hands, the light I give? Is it not enough that you are one of those  whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years  to wear it low upon my brow?'    Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge  of having wilfully 'bonneted' the Spirit at any period of his life. He  then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.    'Your welfare!' said the Ghost.

There's no place in the world like Kilmore. I love even the  cabins, and the peat fires, and the pigs, and the potatoes! I shan't  forget a single stick or stone of it, and I shall never know a moment's  happiness till I'm home again.\"    After considerable hesitation, and the examination of a large number of  prospectuses, Major and Mrs. Fitzgerald had determined to send Honor to  Chessington College. It had a wide and well-deserved reputation, and  Miss Cavendish, the principal, was understood to give much individual  attention to the characters and dispositions of her pupils. Added to  this, it was situated within a few miles of the Naval Preparatory  School where Dermot, Honor's younger brother, had been for the last two  years; so that they knew from experience that the neighbourhood was  bracing and healthy.    \"It's a comfort, at any rate, that I shall be near Dermot,\" said Honor,  as she sat watching while her mother superintended the maid who was  packing her boxes.    \"I'm afraid you won't see much of him, dear, during term-time,\" replied  Mrs. Fitzgerald. \"He will not be able to visit you, I'm sure; neither  will Miss Cavendish allow you to go out with him.\"    \"Why not?\" demanded Honor.    \"Because it would be against the rules.\"    \"Then the rules are absurd, and I shan't keep them.\"    \"Honor! Honor! Don't speak like that! You have run wild here, but at  Chessington College you will be obliged to fall in with the ordinary  regulations.\"    \"They'll have hard work to tame me, Mother!\" laughed Honor, jumping up  and dancing a little impromptu jig between the boxes. \"I don't want to  go, but since I must, I mean to get any enjoyment I can out of it.  After all, perhaps it may be rather fun. It's deadly dull here  sometimes, when the boys are at school, and Father is busy or away.\"    Mrs. Fitzgerald sighed. In her delicate health she could scarcely  expect to be a companion for Honor, yet when she thought of how few  years might be left them together, the parting seemed bitter, and she  was hurt that her only daughter would evidently miss her so little.  Young folks often say cruel things from mere thoughtlessness, and  unintentionally grieve those who love them. In after years Honor would  keenly regret her tactless speech, and blame herself that she had not  spent more hours in trying to be a comfort, instead of a care; but for  the present, though she noticed the look of disappointment that passed  over the sensitive face, she did not fully realize its cause, and the  words that might have healed the wound went unspoken.    At length the preparations were concluded, and the time had almost  arrived to bid farewell to Kilmore Castle and the surrounding demesne.  Honor's friends in the village mourned her approaching departure with  characteristic Irish grief.    \"Miss Honor, darlint, it's meself that will be hungerin' for a sight of  yez!\" cried old Mary O'Grady, standing at the doorway of her thatched  cabin, from which the blue peat smoke issued like a thin mist.    \"And it's grand news entoirely they'll be afther tellin' me too, that  ye're lavin' the Castle, and goin' over the seas!\" put in Biddy  Macarthy, a next-door neighbour of Mary's. \"It's fine to think of all  the iligant things ye'll be seein' now!\"    \"Bless your bright eyes, it's many a sad heart ye'll lave behind yez!\"  added Pat Conolly, the oldest tenant on the estate.    \"England can never compare with dear Ireland, in my opinion,\" replied  Honor, with a choke in her voice. \"There's no spot so sweet as Kilmore,  and all the while I'm away I shall be wishing myself back in the 'ould  counthree'!\"    \"Will ye be despisin' this bit of a present, Miss Honor?\" said old  Mary, producing a cardboard box, from which, out of many folds of  tissue paper, she proudly displayed a large bunch of imitation  four-leaved shamrock. \"My grandson Micky brought it for me all the way  from Dublin city, and I've kept it fine and new in its papers. Sure, I  know it's not worthy of offerin' to a young lady like yourself, but  I'll take it kindly if ye'll deign to accept it.\"    \"Of course I'll accept it!\" returned Honor heartily. \"It's very kind of  you to give it to me. It shall go to school with me, as a remembrance  of Ireland, and of you all.\"    \"The four-leaved shamrock brings good luck to its wearer, mavourneen;  may it bring it to you! And whenever ye look at the little green  leaves, give a thought to the true hearts that will be ay wishin' ye a  speedy return.\"    The last day came all too soon, and Mrs. Fitzgerald, with tears in her  eyes, stood at her window, watching the disappearing carriage in which  Honor sat by her father's side, waving an energetic good-bye.    \"Surely,\" she said to herself, \"school will have the influence that we  expect! The general atmosphere of law and order, the well-arranged  rules, the esprit de corps and strict discipline of the games, all  cannot fail to have their effect; and among so large a number of  companions, and in the midst of so many new and absorbing interests, my  wild bird will find her wings clipped, and will settle down sensibly  and peaceably among the others.\"          CHAPTER III    The Wearing of the Green      Chessington College stood on a breezy slope midway between the hills  and the sea, and about a mile from the rising watering-place of  Dunscar. It was a famous spot for a school, as the fresh winds coming  either from the uplands or from the wide expanse of channel were  sufficient to blow away all chance of germs, and to ensure a thoroughly  wholesome and bracing atmosphere. The College prided itself upon its  record of health; Miss Cavendish considered no other girls were so  straight and well-grown as hers, with such bright eyes, such clear  skins, and such blooming cheeks. Ventilation, sea baths, and suitable  diet were her three watchwords, and thanks to them the sanatorium at  the farther side of the shrubbery scarcely ever opened its doors to  receive a patient, while the hospital nurse who was retained in case of  emergencies found her position a sinecure.    The buildings were modern and up-to-date, with all the latest  appliances and improvements. They were provided with steam heat and  electric light; and the gymnasium, chemical laboratory, and practical  demonstration kitchen were on the very newest of educational lines. The  school covered a large space, and was built in the form of a square. In  the middle was a great, gravelled quadrangle, where hockey could be  practised on days when the fields were too wet for playing. At one end  stood the big lecture-hall, the chapel, the library, and the various  classrooms, the whole surmounted by a handsome clock tower; while  opposite was the School House, where Miss Cavendish herself presided  over a chosen fifty of her two hundred pupils. The two sides of the  square were occupied by four houses, named respectively St. Aldwyth's,  St. Hilary's, St. Chad's, and St. Bride's, each being in charge of a  mistress, and capable of accommodating from thirty to forty girls.  Though the whole school met together every day for lessons, the members  of each different house resembled a separate family, and were keenly  anxious to maintain the honour of their particular establishment. Miss  Cavendish did not wish to excite rivalry, yet she thought a spirit of  friendly emulation was on the whole salutary, and encouraged matches  between the various house teams, or competitions among the choral and  debating societies. The rules for all were exactly similar. Every  morning, at a quarter to seven, a clanging bell rang in the passages  for a sufficient length of time to disturb even the soundest of  slumbers; breakfast was at half-past seven, and at half-past eight  everybody was due in chapel for a short service; lectures and classes  occupied the morning from nine till one, and the afternoon was devoted  to games; tea was at four, and supper at half-past seven, with  preparation in between; and after that hour came sewing and recreation,  until bedtime. It was a well-arranged and reasonable division of time,  calculated to include right proportions of work and play. _Mens sana  in corpore sano_ was Miss Cavendish's favourite motto, and the clean  bill of health, the successes in examinations, and the high moral tone  that prevailed throughout pointed to the fulfilment of her ideal. Most  of the girls were thoroughly happy at Chessington College, and, though  it is in girl nature to grumble at rules and lessons, there was  scarcely one who would have cared to leave it if she had been given the  opportunity.    It was to this new, interesting, and exciting world of school that  Honor unclosed her eyes on the morning after her arrival. She opened  them sleepily, and, I regret to say, promptly shut them again, and  turned over comfortably in bed, regardless of the vigorous bell that  was delivering its warning in the passage. Punctuality had not been  counted a cardinal virtue at Kilmore Castle, and she saw no special  necessity for rising until she felt inclined. She had just dropped off  again into a delicious doze when once more her peace was rudely  disturbed. The curtain of her cubicle was drawn back, and three lively  faces made their appearance.    \"Look here! Don't you know it's time to get up?\" said Maisie Talbot,  administering a vigorous poke that would have roused the Seven Sleepers  of legendary lore, and caused even Honor to yawn.    \"You'll be fined a penny if you're late for breakfast,\" added Lettice,  \"and that's a very unsatisfactory way of disposing of one's  pocket-money.\"    \"And makes Miss Maitland particularly irate,\" said Pauline Reynolds.    \"Honor Fitzgerald! do you intend to get up, or do you not? Because if  you don't, we shall have to try 'cold pig'!\" Then, as there were no  signs of movement, Lettice carried out her threat by"]]]
