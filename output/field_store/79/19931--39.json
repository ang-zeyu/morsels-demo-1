Vessels, and other bodies, which have been sunk in  the ocean, have been sometimes raised by means of airtight sacks,  attached to different parts of the object by means of diving bells,  been inflated with air, forced down through hollow tubes by pumps,  till they thus acquired a buoyancy sufficient for the purpose. The  power of buoyancy has also been applied for elevating vessels above  water, by placing hollow trunks, filled with water, under the keel of  the vessel, and then pumping them out. One of the best methods that  has ever yet been proposed for raising vessels to repair, is to place  under the keel a horizontal platform, to which is attached four large  hollow trunks under its four corners: the trunks to be filled with  water, and to have open apertures in the bottom of each. Then by  allowing a stream of atmospheric air, to rush by its own expansive  force from the reservoirs in which it had been previously compressed,  through suitable pipes or hose, into each trunk, the water is expelled  through the apertures in the bottom, and the vessel is elevated  immediately, and without loss of time. In this case, the reservoirs  (iron cylinders) of compressed air, may be recharged by steam or other  power, during the process of repairing one vessel, and be thus in  readiness for another. A patent has been granted for this invention,  but it has not yet been put in operation on a scale of practical use,  though the patentee would willingly give the right of the patent to  any person or company who should be disposed to construct the  apparatus on a large scale. We have recently given a description of  Mr. Spencer's plan for elevating vessels, and some other modes have  been recently projected, which we may describe in a future number.           *       *       *       *       *          INFORMATION TO PERSONS HAVING BUSINESS TO  TRANSACT AT THE PATENT OFFICE.      SEC. 1. The existing laws relating to patents are those approved July  4, 1836, March 3, 1837, and March 3, 1839; all former acts having been  repealed by the act of 1836.    SEC. 2. \"Patents are granted for any new and useful art, machine,  manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful  improvement on any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of  matter, not known or used by others before his or their discovery or  invention thereof, and not, at the time of his application for a  patent, in public use, or on sale, with his or their consent, or  allowance, as the inventor or discoverer.\" Act of 1836, section 6. \"No  patent shall be held to be invalid by reason of the purchase, sale, or  use [of the invention,] prior to the application for a patent as  aforesaid, except on proof of abandonment of such invention to the  public, or that such purchase, sale or public use, has been for more  than two years prior to such application for a patent.\"--Act of March  3, 1839.    SEC. 3. The term for which a patent is granted, is fourteen years; but  it may, under certain circumstances, be renewed for seven years, as  hereinafter mentioned.    SEC. 4. Patents are granted to citizens of the United States, to  aliens who shall have been resident in the United States one year  preceding, and shall have made oath of their intention to become  citizens thereof, and also to foreigners who are inventors or  discoverers.    SEC. 5. A patent may be taken out by the inventor in a foreign  country, without affecting his right to a patent in the United States,  provided the invention has not been introduced into public and common  use in the United States prior to the application for such patent. In  every such case the patent is limited to fourteen years from the date  of the foreign letter patent. A patent is not granted upon  introduction of a new invention from a foreign country, unless the  person who introduced it be the inventor or discoverer. If an alien  neglects to put and continue on sale the invention in the United  States, to the public, on reasonable terms, for eighteen months, the  patentee Uses all benefit of the patent.    SEC. 6. Joint inventors are entitled to a joint patent, but neither  can claim one separately.    SEC. 7. An invention can assign his right before a patent is obtained,  so as to enable the assignee to take out a patent in his own name; but  the assignment must be first entered on record; and the application  therefor must be duly made, and the specification signed, and sworn to  by the inventor. And in the case of an assignment by a foreigner, the  same fee will be required as if the patent issued to the inventor.    SEC. 8. The assignment of a patent may be to the whole or to an  undivided part, \"by any instrument in writing.\" All assignments, and  also the grant or conveyance of the use of the patent in any town,  comity, State, or specified district, must be recorded in the Patent  Office, within three months from date of the same.--But assignments,  if recorded after three months have expired, will be on record as  notice to protect against subsequent purchases. No fee is now charged  for recording assignments. Patents, grants, and assignments, recorded  prior to the 15th of December, 1836, must be recorded anew before they  can be valid as evidence of any title. This is also free of expense.    SEC. 9. In case of the decease of an inventor, before he had obtained  a patent for his invention, \"the right of applying for and obtaining  such patent shall devolve on the administrator or executor of such  person, in trust for the heirs of law of the deceased, if he shall  have died intestate; but if otherwise, then in trust for his devisees,  in as full and ample manner, and under the same conditions,  limitations, and restrictions, as the same was held, or might have  been claimed or enjoyed, by such person in his or her lifetime; and  when application for a patent shall be made by such legal  representatives, the oath or affirmation shall be so varied as to be  applicable to them.\"--Act of 1836, sec. 10.    SEC. 10, The Patent Office will be open for examination during office  hours, and applicants can personally, or by attorney, satisfy  themselves on inspection of models and specifications, of the  expediency of filing an application for a patent.    SEC. 11. All fees received are paid into the Treasury, and the law has  required the payment of the patent fee before the application is  considered; two-thirds of which fee is refunded on withdrawing the  application. But no money is refunded on the withdrawal of an  application, after an appeal has been taken from the decision of the  Commissioner of Patents. And no part of the fee paid for caveats, and  on applications for the addition of improvements re-issues, and  appeals, can be withdrawn.    SEC. 12. It is a frequent practice for inventors to send a description  of their inventions to the office, and inquire whether there exists  any thing like it, and whether a patent can be had therefor. _As the  law does not provide for the examination of descriptions of new  inventions, except upon application for a Patent, no answer can be  given to such inquiries_.           *       *       *       *       *      A sentimental writer says it is astonishing how much light a man may  radiate upon the world around him, especially when the body he admires  is beside him.           *       *       *       *       *      Among the persons who recently laid in the Boston jail over Sunday,  and were fined Monday morning for intemperance or rowdyism, were a  member of the bar and a clergy man.           *       *       *       *       *      Said a bishop to a rough wagoner, \"you seem better fed than taught.\"  \"Of course,\" replied the fellow, \"for we _feed_ ourselves, but for  teaching we depend on _you._\"           *       *       *       *       *          [Illustration: The Reg(ulator?)]      The use of a pair of conical drums in reversed position, and connected  by a band, as shown in the cut, has been known for several years to a  few, but yet are not extensively known, and but a few of them have  been seen in operation in this country. It will be seen that if the  band be removed laterally, either to the right or left, the relative  motion of drums will be materially varied. These drums being arranged  to constitute a connection of motion between the driving power and  driven machine, may be made to render the motion of the latter either  regular or irregular at the option of the operator. If the band  connecting the drums, is governed by a shifting lever connected with a  _governor_, it may be so adjusted as to keep the motion of the machine  regular, although the driving power should be irregular in its motion,  as is the case with a wind-wheel. But if the operator is engaged,  requires a move rapid motion at one time than at another, he can  accommodate himself by shifting the position of the cone-band, to the  right or left, as occasion may require. This is very convenient for  turners, whose business requires at some times a rapid speed of the  mandrill, and at other times a slow or gentle motion. These drums, as  represented, must be swelled in the centre, that the band may be kept  uniformly straight.           *       *       *       *       *          A REMARKABLE MINERAL SPRING.      It may not perhaps be generally known even to our own citizens that  there is in the town of Riga, N.Y., one mile east of Churchville, on  the farm of Linus Pierson, a Mineral Spring, the gases from which are  sufficiently combustible to burn as clear and brightly as a lamp, at  all times of the day and night, and which is never exhausted. The  spring is located near the bathing-house on the farm, and a tube has  been constructed, leading from the spring to the rooms, by means of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#5)"],[1," livery, half-black,  half-white, a species of Anthrax (_A. sinuata_),[3] flying indolently  from gallery to gallery, doubtless with the object of laying their  eggs there; and here are others, more numerous, whose mission is  fulfilled and who, having died in harness, are hanging dry and  shrivelled in the Spiders' webs. Elsewhere the entire surface of a  perpendicular bank is hung with the dried corpses of a Beetle  (_Sitaris humeralis_), slung, like the Flies, in the silken meshes of  the Spiders. Among these corpses some male Sitares circle, busy,  amorous, heedless of death, mating with the first female that passes  within reach, while the fertilized females thrust their bulky abdomens  into the opening of a gallery and disappear into it backwards. It is  impossible to mistake the situation: some grave interest attracts to  this spot these two insects, which, within a few days, make their  appearance, mate, lay their eggs and die at the very doors of the  Anthophora's dwellings.    [Footnote 3: Cf. _The Life of the Fly_, by J. Henri Fabre, translated  by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos: chaps. ii. and iv.--_Translator's  Note_.]    Let us now give a few blows of the pick to the surface beneath which  the singular incidents already in our mind must be occurring, beneath  which similar things occurred last year; perhaps we shall find some  evidence of the parasitism which we suspected. If we search the  dwellings of the Anthophorae during the early days of August, this is  what we see: the cells forming the superficial layer are not like  those situated at a greater depth. This difference arises from the  fact that the same establishment is exploited simultaneously by the  Anthophora and by an Osmia (_O. tricornis_)[4] as is proved by an  observation made at the working-period, in May. The Anthophorae are  the actual pioneers, the work of boring the galleries is wholly  theirs; and their cells are situated right at the end. The Osmia  profits by the galleries which have been abandoned either because of  their age, or because of the completion of the cells occupying the  most distant part; she builds her cells by dividing these corridors  into unequal and inartistic chambers by means of rude earthen  partitions. The Osmia's sole achievement in the way of masonry is  confined to these partitions. This, by the way, is the ordinary  building-method adopted by the various Osmiae, who content themselves  with a chink between two stones, an empty Snail-shell, or the dry and  hollow stem of some plant, wherein to build their stacks of cells, at  small expense, by means of light partitions of mortar.    [Footnote 4: Cf. _Bramble-bees and Others_: _passim_.--_Translator's  Note_.]    The cells of the Anthophora, with their faultless geometrical  regularity and their perfect finish, are works of art, excavated, at a  suitable depth, in the very substance of the loamy bank, without any  manufactured part save the thick lid that closes the orifice. Thus  protected by the prudent industry of their mother, well out of reach  in their distant, solid retreats, the Anthophora's larvae are devoid  of the glandular apparatus designed for secreting silk. They therefore  never spin a cocoon, but lie naked in their cells, whose inner surface  has the polish of stucco.    In the Osmia's cells, on the other hand, means of defence are  required, for these are situated in the surface layer of the bank;  they are irregular in form, rough inside and barely protected, by  their thin earthen partitions, against external enemies. The Osmia's  larvae, in fact, contrive to enclose themselves in an egg-shaped  cocoon, dark brown in colour and very strong, which preserves them  both from the rough contact of their shapeless cells and from the  mandibles of voracious parasites, Acari,[5] Cleri[6] and Anthreni,[7]  those manifold enemies whom we find prowling in the galleries, seeking  whom they may devour. It is by means of this equipoise between the  mother's talents and the larva's that the Osmia and the Anthophora, in  their early youth, escape some part of the dangers which threaten  them. It is easy therefore, in the bank excavated by these two Bees,  to recognize the property of either species by the situation and form  of the cells and also by their contents, which consist, with the  Anthophora, of a naked larva and, with the Osmia, of a larva enclosed  in a cocoon.    [Footnote 5: Mites and Ticks.--_Translator's Note_.]    [Footnote 6: A genus of Beetles of which certain species (_Clerus  apiarius_ and _C. alvearius_) pass their preparatory state in the  nests of Bees, where they feed on the grubs.--_Translator's Note_.]    [Footnote 7: Another genus of Beetles. The grub of _A. musaeorum_, the  Museum Beetle, is very destructive to  insect-collections.--_Translator's Note_.]    On opening a certain number of these cocoons, we end by discovering  some which, in place of the Osmia's larva, contain each a curiously  shaped nymph. These nymphs, at the least shock received by their  dwelling, indulge in extravagant movements, lashing the walls with  their abdomen till the whole house shakes and dances. And, even if we  leave the cocoon intact, we are informed of their presence by a dull  rustle heard inside the silken dwelling the moment after we move it.    The fore-part of this nymph is fashioned like a sort of boar's-snout  armed with six strong spikes, a multiple ploughshare, eminently  adapted for burrowing in the soil. A double row of hooks surmounts the  dorsal ring of the four front segments of the abdomen. These are so  many grappling-irons, with whose assistance the creature is enabled to  progress in the narrow gallery dug by the snout. Lastly, a sheaf of  sharp points forms the armour of the hinder-part. If we examine  attentively the surface of the vertical wall which contains the  various nests, it will not be long before we discover nymphs like  those which we have been describing, with one extremity held in a  gallery of their own diameter, while the fore-part projects freely  into the air. But these nymphs are reduced to their cast skins, along  the back and head of which runs a long slit through which the perfect  insect has escaped. The purpose of the nymph's powerful weapons is  thus made manifest: it is the nymph that has to rend the tough cocoon  which imprisons it, to excavate the tightly-packed soil in which it is  buried, to dig a gallery with its six-pointed snout and thus to bring  to the light the perfect insect, which apparently is incapable of  performing these strenuous tasks for itself.    And in fact these nymphs, taken in their cocoons, have in a few days'  time given me a feeble Fly (_Anthrax sinuata_) who is quite incapable  of piercing the cocoon and still more of making her exit through a  soil which I cannot easily break up with my pick. Although similar  facts abound in insect history, we always notice them with a lively  interest. They tell us of an incomprehensible power which suddenly, at  a given moment, irresistibly commands an obscure grub to abandon the  retreat in which it enjoys security, in order to make its way through  a thousand difficulties and to reach the light, which would be fatal  to it on any other occasion, but which is necessary to the perfect  insect, which could not reach it by its own efforts.    But the layer of Osmia-cells has been removed; and the pick now  reaches the Anthophora's cells. Among these cells are some which  contain larvae and which result from the labours of last May; others,  though of the same date, are already occupied by the perfect insect.  The precocity of metamorphosis varies from one larva to another;  however, a few days' difference of age is enough to explain these  inequalities of development. Other cells, as numerous as the first,  contain a parasitical Hymenopteron, a Melecta (_M. armata_), likewise  in the perfect state. Lastly, there are some, indeed many, which  contain a singular egg-shaped shell, divided into segments with  projecting breathing-pores. This shell is extremely thin and fragile;  it is amber-coloured and so transparent that one can distinguish quite  plainly, through its sides, an adult Sitaris (_S. humeralis_), who  occupies the interior and is struggling as though to set herself at  liberty. This explains the presence here, the pairing and the  egg-laying of the Sitares whom we but now saw roaming, in the company  of the Anthrax-flies, at the entrance to the galleries of the  Anthophorae. The Osmia and the Anthophora, the joint owners of the  premises, have each their parasite: the Anthrax attacks the Osmia and  the Sitaris the Anthophora.    But what is this curious shell in which the Sitaris is invariably  enclosed, a shell unexampled in the Beetle order? Can this be a case  of parasitism in the second degree, that is, can the Sitaris be living  inside the chrysalis of a first parasite, which itself exists at the  cost of the Anthophora's larva or of its provisions? And, even so, how  can this parasite, or these parasites, obtain access to a cell which  seems to be inviolable, because of the depth at which it lies, and  which, moreover, does not reveal, to the most careful examination  under the magnifying-glass, any violent inroad on the enemy's part?  These are the questions that presented themselves to my mind when for  the first time, in 1855, I observed the facts which I have just  related. Three years of assiduous observation enabled me to add one of  its most astonishing chapters to the story of the formation of  insects.    After collecting a fairly large number of these enigmatical shells  containing adult Sitares, I had the satisfaction of observing, at  leisure, the emergence of the perfect insect from the shell, the act  of pairing and the laying of the eggs. The shell is easily broken; a  few strokes of the mandibles, distributed at random, a few kicks are  enough to deliver the perfect insect from its fragile"]]]
