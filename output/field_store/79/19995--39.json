Within this  group are the stresses created by the adductors of the jaw, pulling  down and medially from the roof, and sometimes, during contraction,  pushing out against the cheek.    It is reasonable to assume that the vectors of these stresses were  concentrated at the loci of their origin. For example, the effect of  the forces created by the articulation of the jaw upon the skull was  concentrated at the joint between the quadrate, quadratojugal, and  squamosal bones. From this relatively restricted area, the stresses  radiated out over the temporal region. Similarly, the stresses  transmitted by the occiput radiated over the cheek from the points of  articulation of the dermal roof with the occipital plate. In both of  these examples, the vectors paralleled the plane of the cheek bones.  Similar radiation from a restricted area, but of a secondary nature,  resulted from stresses applied obliquely to the plane of the cheek. The  initial stresses caused by the adductors of the jaw resulted from  muscles pulling away from the skull-roof; secondary stresses, created  at the origins of these muscles, radiated out over the cheek, parallel  to its plane.    The result of the summation of all of those vectors was a complex grid  of intersecting lines of force passing in many directions both  parallel to the plane of the cheek and at the perpendicular or at an  angle oblique to the perpendicular to the plane of the cheek.    Complexities are infused into this analysis with the division of  relatively undifferentiated muscles into subordinate groups. The  differentiation of the muscles was related to changing food habits,  increased mobility of the head, and increase in the freedom of movement  of the shoulder girdle and forelimbs (Olson, 1961:214). As Olson has  pointed out, this further localized the stresses to which the bone was  subjected. Additional localization of stresses was created with the  origin and development of tetrapods (reptiles) that were independent of  an aquatic environment and were subjected to greater effects of gravity  and loss of bouyancy in the migration from the aqueous environment to  the environment of air. The localization of these stresses was in the  border area of the cheek, away from its center.    What evidence is available to support this analysis of hypothetical  forces transmitted through the fully-roofed skull of such an animal as  _Captorhinus_?    It is axiomatic that bones or parts of bones that are subject to  increased stress become thicker, at least in part. This occurs  ontogenetically, and it occurs phylogenetically through selection. Weak  bones will not be selected for. Figure 10 illustrates the pattern of  the areas of the skull-roof in the temporal region that are marked on  the internal surface by broad, low thickened ridges. The position of  these ridges correlates well with the position of the oriented stresses  that were presumably applied to the skull of _Captorhinus_ during life.  It can be seen from Figure 10 that the central area of the cheek is  thinner than parts of the cheek that border the central area. The  thickened border areas were the regions of the cheek that were  subjected to greater stress than the thin central areas.    External evidence of stress may also be present. The pattern of  sculpturing of _Captorhinus_ is presented in Figure 11. The longer  ridges are arranged in a definite pattern. Their position and direction  correlates well with the thickened border of the cheek, the region in  which the stresses are distinctly oriented. For example, a ridge is  present on the internal surface of the squamosal along its dorsal  border. Externally, the sculptured ridges are long and roughly  parallel, both to each other and to the internal ridge.    The central area of the cheek is characterized by a reticulate pattern  of short ridges, without apparent orientation. The thinness of the bone  in this area indicates that stresses were less severe here. The random  pattern of the sculpture also indicates that the stresses passed in  many directions, parallel to the plane of the cheek and obliquely to  that plane.      _Possible Explanation for the Appearance of Temporal Openings_    Bone has three primary functions: support, protection and participation  in calcium metabolism. Let us assume that the requirements of calcium  metabolism affect the mass of bone that is selected for, but do not  grossly affect the morphology of the bones of that mass. Then selection  operates to meet the needs for support within the limits that are set  by the necessity to provide the protection for vital organs. After the  needs for protection are satisfied, the remaining variable and the one  most effective in determining the morphology of bones is selection for  increased efficiency in meeting stress.    Let us also assume that bone increases in size and/or compactness in  response to selection for meeting demands of increased stress, but is  selected against when requirements for support are reduced or absent.  Selection against bone could only be effective within the limits  prescribed by the requirements for protection and calcium metabolism.    We may therefore assume that there is conservation in selection against  characters having multiple functions. Since bone is an organ system  that plays a multiple role in the vertebrate organism, a change in the  selective pressures that affect one of the roles of bone can only be  effective within the limits set by the other roles. For example,  selection against bone that is no longer essential for support can  occur only so long as the metabolic and protective needs of the  organism provided by that character are not compromised. If a character  no longer has a positive survival value and is not linked with a  character that does have a positive survival value, then the metabolic  demands for the development and maintenance of that character no longer  have a positive survival value. A useless burden of metabolic demands  is placed upon the organism because the character no longer aids the  survival of the organism. If selection caused, for example, muscles to  migrate away from the center of the cheek, the bone that had previously  provided support for these muscles would have lost one of its  functions. If in a population of such individuals, variation in the  thickness of the bone of the cheek occurred, those with thinner bone in  the cheek would be selected for, because less metabolic activity was  diverted to building and maintaining what is now a character of reduced  functional significance. A continuation of the process would eliminate  the bone or part of the bone in question while increasing the metabolic  efficiency of the organism. The bone is no longer essential for  support, the contribution of the mass of bone to calcium metabolism and  the contribution of this part of the skeleton to protection have not  been compromised, and the available energy can be diverted to other  needs.    The study of _Captorhinus_ has indicated that the central area of the  cheek was subjected to less stress than the border areas. A similar  condition in basal reptiles may well have been present. A continued  trend in reducing the thickness of the bone of the cheek in the manner  described above may well have resulted in the appearance of the first  reptiles with temporal fenestrae arising from the basal stock.    Such an explanation adequately accounts for an increased selective  advantage in the step-by-step thinning of the cheek-wall prior to the  time of actual breakthrough. It is difficult to see the advantage  during such stages if explanations of weight reduction or bulging  musculature are accepted.    After the appearance of temporal fenestrae, selection for the classical  factors is quite acceptable to explain the further development of  fenestration. The continued enlargement of the temporal fenestrae in  the pelycosaur-therapsid lineage undoubtedly was correlated with the  advantages accrued from securing greater space to allow increased  lateral expansion of contracting mandibular adductors. Similarly,  weight in absolute terms can reasonably be suggested to explain the  dramatic fenestration in the skeletons of many large dinosaurs.      Literature Cited    ADAMS, L. A.         1919.

He was also conspicuous in his efforts to secure  provisions for gradual emancipation. Two years later he became a planter  near Huntsville, Alabama. Though not a member of the Constitutional  Convention preparatory to the admission of this Territory into  the Union, Birney used his influence to secure provisions in the  constitution favorable to gradual emancipation. As a member of the first  Legislature, in 1819, he was the author of a law providing a fair trial  by jury for slaves indicted for crimes above petty larceny, and in 1826  he became a regular contributor to the American Colonization Society,  believing it to be an aid to emancipation. The following year he was  able to induce the Legislature, although he was not then a member of it,  to pass an act forbidding the importation of slaves into Alabama  either for sale or for hire. This was regarded as a step preliminary to  emancipation.    The cause of education in Alabama had in Birney a trusted leader. During  the year 1830 he spent several months in the North Atlantic States  for the selection of a president and four professors for the State  University and three teachers for the Huntsville Female Seminary. These  were all employed upon his sole recommendation. On his return he had an  important interview with Henry Clay, of whose political party he had for  several years been the acknowledged leader in Alabama. He urged Clay  to place himself at the head of the movement in Kentucky for gradual  emancipation. Upon Clay's refusal their political cooperation  terminated. Birney never again supported Clay for office and regarded  him as in a large measure responsible for the pro-slavery reaction in  Kentucky.    Birney, who had now become discouraged regarding the prospect of  emancipation, during the winter of 1831 and 1832 decided to remove his  family to Jacksonville, Illinois. He was deterred from carrying out  his plan, however, by his unexpected appointment as agent of the  colonization society in the Southwest--a mission which he undertook from  a sense of duty.    In his travels throughout the region assigned to him, Birney became  aware of the aggressive designs of the planters of the Gulf States to  secure new slave territories in the Southwest. In view of these facts  the methods of the colonization society appeared utterly futile. Birney  surrendered his commission and, in 1833, returned to Kentucky with the  intention of doing himself what Henry Clay had refused to do three years  earlier, still hoping that Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee might be  induced to abolish slavery and thus place the slave power in a hopeless  minority. His disappointment was extreme at the pro-slavery reaction  which had taken place in Kentucky. The condition called for more drastic  measures, and Birney decided to forsake entirely the colonization  society and cast in his lot with the abolitionists. He freed his slaves  in 1834, and in the following year he delivered the principal address  at the annual meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society held in New  York. His gift of leadership was at once recognized. As vice-president  of the society he began to travel on its behalf, to address public  assemblies, and especially to confer with members of state legislatures  and to address the legislative bodies. He now devoted his entire time to  the service of the society, and as early as September, 1835, issued the  prospectus of a paper devoted to the cause of emancipation. This called  forth such a display of force against the movement that he could neither  find a printer nor obtain the use of a building in Dansville, Kentucky,  for the publication. As a result he transferred his activities to  Cincinnati, where he began publication of the Philanthropist in 1836.  With the connivance of the authorities and encouragement from leading  citizens of Cincinnati, the office of the Philanthropist was three times  looted by the mob, and the proprietor's life was greatly endangered.  The paper, however, rapidly grew in favor and influence and thoroughly  vindicated the right of free discussion of the slavery question.  Another editor was installed when Birney, who became secretary of the  Anti-slavery Society in 1837, transferred his residence to New York  City.    Twenty-three years before Lincoln's famous utterance in which he  proclaimed the doctrine that a house divided against itself cannot  stand, and before Seward's declaration of an irrepressible conflict  between slavery and freedom, Birney had said: \"There will be no  cessation of conflict until slavery shall be exterminated or liberty  destroyed. Liberty and slavery cannot live in juxtaposition.\" He spoke  out of the fullness of his own experience. A thoroughly trained lawyer  and statesman, well acquainted with the trend of public sentiment in  both North and South, he was fully persuaded that the new pro-slavery  crusade against liberty boded civil war. He knew that the white men in  North and South would not, without a struggle, consent to be permanently  deprived of their liberties at the behest of a few Southern planters.  Being himself of the slaveholding class, he was peculiarly fitted to  appreciate their position. To him the new issue meant war, unless  the belligerent leaders should be shown that war was hopeless. By his  moderation in speech, his candor in statement, his lack of rancor, his  carefully considered, thoroughly fair arguments, he had the rare faculty  of convincing opponents of the correctness of his own view.    There could be little sympathy between Birney and William Lloyd  Garrison, whose style of denunciation appeared to the former as an  incitement to war and an excuse for mob violence. As soon as Birney  became the accepted leader in the national society, there was  friction between his followers and those of Garrison. To denounce  the Constitution and repudiate political action were, from Birney's  standpoint, a surrender of the only hope of forestalling a dire  calamity. He had always fought slavery by the use of legal and  constitutional methods, and he continued so to fight. In this policy he  had the support of a large majority of abolitionists in New England and  elsewhere. Only a few personal friends accepted Garrison's injunction to  forswear politics and repudiate the Constitution.    The followers of Birney, failing to secure recognition for their views  in either of the political parties, organized the Liberty party and,  while Birney was in Europe in 1840, nominated him as their candidate  for the Presidency. The vote which he received was a little over seven  thousand, but four years later he was again the candidate of the party  and received over sixty thousand votes. He suffered an injury during the  following year which condemned him to hopeless invalidism and brought  his public career to an end.    Though Lundy and Birney were contemporaries and were engaged in the same  great cause, they were wholly independent in their work. Lundy addressed  himself almost entirely to the non-slaveholding class, while all of  Birney's early efforts were \"those of a slaveholder seeking to induce  his own class to support the policy of emancipation.\" Though a Northern  man, Lundy found his chief support in the South until he was driven out  by persecution. Birney also resided in the South until he was forced to  leave for the same reason. The two men were in general accord in their  main lines of policy: both believed firmly in the use of political means  to effect their objects; both were at first colonizationists, though  Lundy favored colonization in adjacent territory rather than by  deportation to Africa.    Women were not a whit behind men in their devotion to the cause of  freedom. Conspicuous among them were Sarah and Angelina Grimke, born in  Charleston, South Carolina, of a slaveholding family noted for learning,  refinement, and culture. Sarah was born in the same year as James G.  Birney, 1792; Angelina was thirteen years younger. Angelina was the  typical crusader: her sympathies from the first were with the slave.  As a child she collected and concealed oil and other simple remedies so  that she might steal out by night and alleviate the sufferings of slaves  who had been cruelly whipped or abused. At the age of fourteen she  refused to be confirmed in the Episcopal Church because the ceremony  involved giving sanction to words which seemed to her untrue. Two years  later her mother offered her a present of a slave girl for a servant and  companion. This gift she refused to accept, for in her view the servant  had a right to be free, and, as for her own needs, Angelina felt quite  capable of waiting upon herself.    Of her own free will she joined the Presbyterian Church and labored  earnestly with the officers of the church to induce them to espouse the  cause of the slave. When she failed to secure cooperation, she decided  that the church was not Christian and she therefore withdrew her  membership. Her sister Sarah had gone North in 1821 and had become a  member of the Society of Friends in Philadelphia. In Charleston, South  Carolina, there was a Friends' meeting-house where two old Quakers  still met at the appointed time and sat for an hour in solemn silence.  Angelina donned the Quaker garb, joined this meeting, and for an entire  year was the third of the silent worshipers. This quiet testimony,  however, did not wholly satisfy her energetic nature, and when, in  1830, she heard of the imprisonment of Garrison in Baltimore, she was  convinced that effective labors against slavery could not be carried on  in the"]]]
