[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#5)"],[1,"Neopolitanus was captain of a troop of horse, and had the  custody of Scythopolis intrusted to his care by the enemy; and when  I had hindered him from doing any further mischief to Tiberias, I set  myself to make provision for the affairs of Galilee.    25. But when John, the son of Levi, who, as we before told you, abode at  Gischala, was informed how all things had succeeded to my mind, and  that I was much in favor with those that were under me, as also that the  enemy were greatly afraid of me, he was not pleased with it, as thinking  my prosperity tended to his ruin. So he took up a bitter envy and enmity  against me; and hoping, that if he could inflame those that were under  me to hate me, he should put an end to the prosperity I was in, he  tried to persuade the inhabitants of Tiberias and of Sepphoris, [and for  those of Gabara he supposed they would be also of the same mind with the  others,] which were the greatest cities of Galilee, to revolt from their  subjection to me, and to be of his party; and told them that he would  command them better than I did. As for the people of Sepphoris, who  belonged to neither of us, because they had chosen to be in subjection  to the Romans, they did not comply with his proposal; and for those of  Tiberias, they did not indeed so far comply as to make a revolt from  under me, but they agreed to be his friends, while the inhabitants of  Gabara did go over to John; and it was Simon that persuaded them so to  do, one who was both the principal man in the city, and a particular  friend and companion of John. It is true, these did not openly own the  making a revolt, because they were in great fear of the Galileans, and  had frequent experience of the good-will they bore to me; yet did they  privately watch for a proper opportunity to lay snares for me; and  indeed I thereby came into the greatest danger, on the occasion  following.    26. There were some bold young men of the village of Dabaritta, who  observed that the wife of Ptolemy, the king's procurator, was to make  a progress over the great plain with a mighty attendance, and with some  horsemen that followed as a guard to them, and this out of a country  that was subject to the king and queen, into the jurisdiction of the  Romans; and fell upon them on a sudden, and obliged the wife of Ptolemy  to fly away, and plundered all the carriages. They also came to me to  Tarichese, with four mules' loading of garments, and other furniture;  and the weight of the silver they brought was not small, and there were  five hundred pieces of gold also. Now I had a mind to preserve these  spoils for Ptolemy, who was my countryman; and it is prohibited [12]  by our laws even to spoil our enemies; so I said to those that brought  these spoils, that they ought to be kept, in order to rebuild the walls  of Jerusalem with them when they came to be sold. But the young men  took it very ill that they did not receive a part of those spoils  for themselves, as they expected to have done; so they went among the  villages in the neighborhood of Tiberias, and told the people that I was  going to betray their country to the Romans, and that I used deceitful  language to them, when I said, that what had been thus gotten by rapine  should be kept for the rebuilding of the walls of the city of Jerusalem;  although I had resolved to restore these spoils again to their former  owner. And indeed they were herein not mistaken as to my intentions; for  when I had gotten clear of them, I sent for two of the principal men,  Dassion, and Janneus the son of Levi, persons that were among the chief  friends of the king, and commanded them to take the furniture that had  been plundered, and to send it to him; and I threatened that I would  order them to be put to death by way of punishment, if they discovered  this my command to any other person.    27. Now, when all Galilee was filled with this rumor, that their country  was about to be betrayed by me to the Romans, and when all men were  exasperated against me, and ready to bring me to punishment, the  inhabitants of Tarichee did also themselves suppose that what the young  men said was true, and persuaded my guards and armed men to leave me  when I was asleep, and to come presently to the hippodrome, in order  there to take counsel against me their commander. And when they had  prevailed with them, and they were gotten together, they found there a  great company assembled already, who all joined in one clamor, to  bring the man who was so wicked to them as to betray them, to his due  punishment; and it was Jesus, the son of Sapphias, who principally set  them on. He was ruler in Tiberias, a wicked man, and naturally disposed  to make disturbances in matters of consequence; a seditious person he  was indeed, and an innovator beyond every body else. He then took the  laws of Moses into his hands, and came into the midst of the people, and  said, \"O my fellow citizens! if you are not disposed to hate Josephus on  your own account, have regard, however, to these laws of your country,  which your commander-in-chief is going to betray; hate him therefore on  both these accounts, and bring the man who hath acted thus insolently,  to his deserved punishment.\"    28. When he had said this, and the multitude had openly applauded him  for what he had said, he took some of the armed men, and made haste  away to the house in which I lodged, as if he would kill me immediately,  while I was wholly insensible of all till this disturbance happened; and  by reason of the pains I had been taking, was fallen fast asleep. But  Simon, who was intrusted with the care of my body, and was the only  person that stayed with me, and saw the violent incursion the citizens  made upon me, awaked me, and told me of the danger I was in, and desired  me to let him kill me, that I might die bravely and like a general,  before my enemies came in, and forced me [to kill myself], or killed me  themselves. Thus did he discourse to me; but I committed the care of my  life to God, and made haste to go out to the multitude. Accordingly, I  put on a black garment, and hung my sword at my neck, and went by such  a different way to the hippodrome, wherein I thought none of my  adversaries would meet me; so I appeared among them on the sudden, and  fell down flat on the earth, and bedewed the ground with my tears: then  I seemed to them all an object of compassion. And when I perceived the  change that was made in the multitude, I tried to divide their opinions  before the armed men should return from my house; so I granted them that  I had been as wicked as they supposed me to be; but still I entreated  them to let me first inform them for what use I had kept that money  which arose from the plunder, and, that they might then kill me if they  pleased: and upon the multitude's ordering me to speak, the armed men  came upon me, and when they saw me, they ran to kill me; but when the  multitude bade them hold their hands, they complied, and expected that  as soon as I should own to them that I kept the money for the king, it  would be looked on as a confession of my treason, and they should then  be allowed to kill me.    29. When, therefore, silence was made by the whole multitude, I spake  thus to them: \"O my countrymen! I refuse not to die, if justice so  require. However, I am desirous to tell you the truth of this matter  before I die; for as I know that this city of yours [Tarichee] was a  city of great hospitality, and filled with abundance of such men as have  left their own countries, and are come hither to be partakers of your  fortune, whatever it be, I had a mind to build walls about it, out of  this money, for which you are so angry with me, while yet it was to be  expended in building your own walls.\" Upon my saying this, the people  of Taricheae and the strangers cried out, that \"they gave me thanks, and  desired me to be of good courage,\" although the Galileans and the people  of Tiberias continued in their wrath against me, insomuch that there  arose a tumult among them, while some threatened to kill me, and some  bade me not to regard them; but when I promised them that I would build  them walls at Tiberias, and at other cities that wanted them, they gave  credit to what I promised, and returned every one to his own home. So I  escaped the forementioned danger, beyond all my hopes, and returned to  my own house, accompanied with my friends, and twenty armed men also.    30. However, these robbers and other authors of this tumult, who were  afraid, on their own account, lest I should punish them for what they  had done, took six hundred armed men, and came to the house where I  abode, in order to set it on fire. When this their insult was told me, I  thought it indecent for me to run away, and I resolved to expose myself  to danger, and to act with some boldness; so I gave order to shut the  doors, and went up into an upper room, and desired that they would send  in some of their men to receive the money [from the spoils] for I told  them they would then have no occasion to be angry with me; and when they  had sent in one of the boldest of them all, I had him whipped severely,  and I commanded that one of his hands should be cut off, and hung about  his neck; and in this case was he put out to those that sent him. At  which procedure of mine they were greatly affrighted, and in no small  consternation, and were afraid that they should themselves be served in  like manner, if they staid there; for they supposed that I had in  the house more armed men than they had themselves; so they ran away  immediately, while I, by the use of this stratagem, escaped this their  second treacherous design against me.    31. But there were still some that irritated the multitude against me,  and said that those great men that belonged to the king ought not to  be suffered to live, if they would not change their religion to the  religion of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28466"],[0,"A Catalogue of Play Equipment (#5)"],[1,"l,\" Bulletin No. IV.
