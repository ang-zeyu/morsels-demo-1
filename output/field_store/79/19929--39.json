Says Pennant, describing the Chancellor's residence, \"It is  easily known by a large flight of stone steps, which his royal master  permitted to be made into the park adjacent for the accommodation of his  lordship. These steps terminate above in a small court, on three sides  of which stands the house.\" The steps still remain, but their history is  unknown to many of the habitual frequenters of the chapel. After  Jefferys' fall the spacious and imposing mansion, where the  _bon-vivants_ of the bar used to drink inordinately with the wits and  buffoons of the London theatres, was occupied by Government; and there  the Lords of the Admiralty had their offices until they moved to their  quarters opposite Scotland Yard. Narcissus Luttrell's Diary contains the  following entry:--\"April 23, 1690. The late Lord Chancellor's house at  Westminster is taken for the Lords of the Admiralty to keep the  Admiralty Office at.\"    William III., wishing to fix the holders of the Great Seal in a  permanent official home, selected Powis House (more generally known by  the name of Newcastle House), in Lincoln's Inn Fields, as a residence  for Somers and future Chancellors. The Treasury minute books preserve an  entry of September 11, 1696, directing a Privy Seal to \"discharge the  process for the apprised value of the house, and to declare the king's  pleasure that the Lord Keeper or Lord Chancellor for the time being  should have and enjoy it for the accommodation of their offices.\" Soon  after his appointment to the seals, Somers took possession of this  mansion at the north-west corner of the Fields; and after him Lord  Keeper Sir Nathan Wright, Lord Chancellor Cowper, and Lord Chancellor  Harcourt used it as an official residence. But the arrangement was not  acceptable to the legal dignitaries. They preferred to dwell in their  private houses, from which they were not liable to be driven by a change  of ministry or a grist of popular disfavor. In the year 1711 the mansion  was therefore sold to John Holles, Duke of Newcastle, to whom it is  indebted for the name which it still bears. This large, unsightly  mansion is known to every one who lives in London, and has any knowledge  of the political and social life of the earlier Georgian courtiers and  statesmen.          CHAPTER IV.    LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS.      The annals of the legal profession show that the neighborhood of  Guildhall was a favorite place of residence with the ancient lawyers,  who either held judicial offices within the circle of the Lord Mayor's  jurisdiction, or whose practice lay chiefly in the civic courts. In the  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries there was quite a colony of jurists  hard by the temple of Gogmagog and Cosineus--or Gog and Magog, as the  grotesque giants are designated by the unlearned, who know not the  history of the two famous effigies, which originally figured in an  Elizabethan pageant, stirring the wonder of the illiterate, and  reminding scholars of two mythical heroes about whom the curious reader  of this paragraph may learn further particulars by referring to Michael  Drayton's 'Polyolbion.'    In Milk Street, Cheapside, lived Sir John More, judge in the Court of  King's Bench; and in Milk street, A.D. 1480, was born Sir John's famous  son Thomas, the Chancellor, who was at the same time learned and simple,  witty and pious, notable for gentle meekness and firm resolve, abounding  with tenderness and hot with courage. Richard Rich--who beyond Scroggs  or Jeffreys deserves to be remembered as the arch-scoundrel of the legal  profession--was one of Thomas More's playmates and boon companions for  several years of their boyhood and youth. Richard's father was an  opulent mercer, and one of Sir John's near neighbors; so the youngsters  were intimate until Master Dick, exhibiting at an early age his vicious  propensities, came to be \"esteemed very light of his tongue, a great  dicer and gamester, and not of any commendable fame.\"    On marrying his first wife Sir Thomas More settled in a house in  Bucklersbury, the City being the proper quarter for his residence, as he  was an under-sheriff of the city of London, in which character he both  sat in the Court of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and presided over a  separate court on the Thursday of each week. Whilst living in  Bucklersbury he had chambers in Lincoln's Inn. On leaving Bucklersbury  he took a house in Crosby Place, from which he moved, in 1523, to  Chelsea, in which parish he built the house that was eventually pulled  down by Sir Hans Sloane in the year 1740.    A generation later, Sir Nicholas Bacon was living in Noble Street,  Foster Lane, where he had built the mansion known as Bacon House, in  which he resided till, as Lord Keeper, he took possession of York House.  Chief Justice Bramston lived, at different parts of his career, in  Whitechapel; in Philip Lane, Aldermanbury; and (after his removal from  Bosworth Court) in Warwick Lane, Sir John Bramston (the autobiographer)  married into a house in Charterhouse Yard, where his father, the Chief  Justice, resided with him for a short time.    But from an early date, and especially during the seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries, the more prosperous of the working lawyers either  lived within the walls of the Inns, or in houses lying near the law  colleges. Fleet Street, the Strand, Holborn, Chancery Lane, and the good  streets leading into those thoroughfares, contained a numerous legal  population in the times between Elizabeth's death and George III.'s  first illness. Rich benchers and Judges wishing for more commodious  quarters than they could obtain at any cost within college-walls,  erected mansions in the immediate vicinity of their Inns; and their  example was followed by less exalted and less opulent members of the bar  and judicial bench. The great Lord Strafford first saw the light in  Chancery Lane, in the house of his maternal grandfather, who was a  bencher of Lincoln's Inn. Lincoln's Inn Fields was principally built for  the accommodation of wealthy lawyers; and in Charles II.'s reign Queen  Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields was in high repute with legal magnates. Sir  Edward Coke lived alternately in chambers, and in Hatton House, Holborn,  the palace that came to him by his second marriage. John Kelyng's house  stood in Hatton Garden, and there he died in 1671. In his mansion in  Lincoln's Inn Fields, Sir Harbottle Grimston, on June 25, 1660 (shortly  before his appointment to the Mastership of the Rolls, for which place  he is said to have given Clarendon L8000), entertained Charles II. and a  grand gathering of noble company. After his marriage Francis North took  his high-born bride into chambers, which they inhabited for a short time  until a house in Chancery Lane, near Serjeants' Inn, was ready for  their use. On Nov. 15, 1666,--the year of the fire of London, in which  year Hyde had his town house in the Strand--Glyn died in his house, in  Portugal Row, Lincoln's Inn Fields. On June 15, 1691, Henry Pollexfen,  Chief Justice of Common Pleas, expired in his mansion in Lincoln's Inn  Fields. These addresses--taken from a list of legal addresses lying  before the writer--indicate with sufficient clearness the quarter of the  town in which Charles II.'s lawyers mostly resided.    Under Charles II. the population of the Inns was such that barristers  wishing to marry could not easily obtain commodious quarters within  College-walls. Dugdale observes \"that all but the benchers go two to a  chamber: a bencher hath only the privilege of a chamber to himself.\" He  adds--\"if there be any one chamber consisting of two parts, and the one  part exceeds the other in value, and he who hath the best part sells the  same, yet the purchaser shall enter into the worst part; for it is a  certain rule that the auntient in the chamber--_viz._, he who was  therein first admitted, without respect to their antiquity in the house,  hath his choice of either part.\" This custom of sharing chambers gave  rise to the word 'chumming,' an abbreviation of 'chambering.' Barristers  in the present time often share a chamber--_i.e._, set of rooms. In the  seventeenth century an utter-barrister found the half of a set of rooms  inconveniently narrow quarters for himself and wife. By arranging  privately with a non-resident brother of the long robe, he sometimes  obtained an entire \"chamber,\" and had the space allotted to a bencher.  When he could not make such an arrangement, he usually moved to a house  outside the gate, but in the immediate vicinity of his inn, as soon as  his lady presented him with children, if not sooner.    Of course working, as well as idle, members of the profession were found  in other quarters. Some still lived in the City; others preferred more  fashionable districts. Roger North, brother of the Lord Keeper and son  of a peer, lived in the Piazza of Covent Garden, in the house formerly  occupied Lely the painter. To this house Sir Dudley North moved from his  costly and dark mansion in the City, and in it he shortly afterwards  died, under the hands of Dr. Radcliffe and the prosperous apothecary,  Mr. St. Amand. \"He had removed,\" writes Roger, \"from his great house in  the City, and came to that in the Piazza which Sir Peter Lely formerly  used, and I had lived in alone for divers years. We were so much  together, and my incumbrances so small, that so large a house might hold  us both.\" Roger was a practicing barrister and Recorder of Bristol.    During his latter years Sir John Bramston (the autobiographer) kept  house in Greek Street, Soho.    In the time of Charles II. the wealthy lawyers often maintained suburban  villas, where they enjoyed the air and pastimes of the country. When his  wife's health failed, Francis North took a villa for her at Hammersmith,  \"for the advantage of better air, which he thought beneficial for her;\"  and whilst his household tarried there, he never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2781"],[0,"Just So Stories (#5)"],[1,"number three!' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. 'You  couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Now how do you feel  about being spanked again?'    ''Scuse me,' said the Elephant's Child, 'but I should not like it at  all.'    'How would you like to spank somebody?' said the  Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.    'I should like it very much indeed,' said the Elephant's Child.    'Well,' said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake, 'you will find that new  nose of yours very useful to spank people with.'    'Thank you,' said the Elephant's Child, 'I'll remember that; and now I  think I'll go home to all my dear families and try.'    So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking  his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree,  instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass  he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he  used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree  and used it as fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool, slushy-squshy  mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through  Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than  several brass bands.    He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus (she was  no relation of his), and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the  Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk.  The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on  his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy Pachyderm.    One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up  his trunk and said, 'How do you do?' They were very glad to see him,  and immediately said, 'Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable  curtiosity.'    'Pooh,' said the Elephant's Child. 'I don't think you peoples know  anything about spanking; but I do, and I'll show you.' Then he uncurled  his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.    'O Bananas!' said they, 'where did you learn that trick, and what have  you done to your nose?'    'I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great  grey-green, greasy Limpopo River,' said the Elephant's Child. 'I asked  him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep.'    'It looks very ugly,' said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.    'It does,' said the Elephant's Child. 'But it's very useful,' and he  picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him  into a hornet's nest.    Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long  time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out  his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the  Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he  shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her  ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any  one touch Kolokolo Bird.    At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one  by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo  River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the  Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody any more; and ever  since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see,  besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk  of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.           I Keep six honest serving-men:         (They taught me all I knew)       Their names are What and Where and When         And How and Why and Who.       I send them over land and sea,         I send them east and west;       But after they have worked for me,         I give them all a rest.         I let them rest from nine till five.         For I am busy then,       As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,         For they are hungry men:       But different folk have different views:         I know a person small--       She keeps ten million serving-men,         Who get no rest at all!       She sends 'em abroad on her own affairs,         From the second she opens her eyes--       One million Hows, two million Wheres,         And seven million Whys!          THE SING-SONG OF OLD MAN KANGAROO    NOT always was the Kangaroo as now we do behold him, but a Different  Animal with four short legs. He was grey and he was woolly, and  his pride was inordinate: he danced on an outcrop in the middle of  Australia, and he went to the Little God Nqa.    He went to Nqa at six before breakfast, saying, 'Make me different from  all other animals by five this afternoon.'    Up jumped Nqa from his seat on the sandflat and shouted, 'Go away!'    He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced  on a rock-ledge in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Middle  God Nquing.    He went to Nquing at eight after breakfast, saying, 'Make me different  from all other animals; make me, also, wonderfully popular by five this  afternoon.'    Up jumped Nquing from his burrow in the spinifex and shouted, 'Go away!'    He was grey and he was woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced  on a sandbank in the middle of Australia, and he went to the Big God  Nqong.    He went to Nqong at ten before dinner-time, saying, 'Make me different  from all other animals; make me popular and wonderfully run after by  five this afternoon.'    Up jumped Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan and shouted, 'Yes, I  will!'    Nqong called Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusty in the  sunshine, and showed him Kangaroo. Nqong said, 'Dingo! Wake up, Dingo!  Do you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit? He wants to be popular  and very truly run after. Dingo, make him SO!'    Up jumped Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--and said, 'What, that cat-rabbit?'    Off ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, grinning like a  coal-scuttle,--ran after Kangaroo.    Off went the proud Kangaroo on his four little legs like a bunny.    This, O Beloved of mine, ends the first part of the tale!    He ran through the desert; he ran through the mountains; he ran through  the salt-pans; he ran through the reed-beds; he ran through the blue  gums; he ran through the spinifex; he ran till his front legs ached.    He had to!    Still ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--always hungry, grinning like a  rat-trap, never getting nearer, never getting farther,--ran after  Kangaroo.    He had to!    Still ran Kangaroo--Old Man Kangaroo. He ran through the ti-trees; he  ran through the mulga; he ran through the long grass; he ran through the  short grass; he ran through the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; he ran  till his hind legs ached.    He had to!    Still ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--hungrier and hungrier, grinning like  a horse-collar, never getting nearer, never getting farther; and they  came to the Wollgong River.    Now, there wasn't any bridge, and there wasn't any ferry-boat, and  Kangaroo didn't know how to get over; so he stood on his legs and  hopped.    He had to!    He hopped through the Flinders; he hopped through the Cinders; he  hopped through the deserts in the middle of Australia. He hopped like a  Kangaroo.    First he hopped one yard; then he hopped three yards; then he hopped  five yards; his legs growing stronger; his legs growing longer. He  hadn't any time for rest or refreshment, and he wanted them very much.    Still ran Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo--very much bewildered, very much  hungry, and wondering what in the world or out of it made Old Man  Kangaroo hop.    For he hopped like a cricket; like a pea in a saucepan; or a new rubber  ball on a nursery floor.    He had to!    He tucked up his front legs; he hopped on his hind legs; he stuck out  his tail for a balance-weight behind him; and he hopped through the  Darling Downs.    He had to!    Still ran Dingo--Tired-Dog Dingo--hungrier and hungrier, very much  bewildered, and wondering when in the world or out of it would Old Man  Kangaroo stop.    Then came Nqong from his bath in the salt-pans, and said, 'It's five  o'clock.'    Down sat Dingo--Poor Dog Dingo--always hungry, dusky in the sunshine;  hung out his tongue and howled.    Down sat Kangaroo--Old Man Kangaroo--stuck out his tail like a  milking-stool behind him, and said, 'Thank goodness that's finished!'    Then said Nqong, who is always a gentleman, 'Why aren't you grateful to  Yellow-Dog Dingo? Why don't you thank him for all he has done for you?'    Then said Kangaroo--Tired Old Kangaroo--He's chased me out of the homes  of my childhood; he's chased me out of my regular meal-times; he's  altered my shape so I'll never get it back; and he's played Old Scratch  with my legs.'    Then said Nqong, 'Perhaps I'm mistaken, but didn't you ask me to make  you different from all other animals, as well as to make you very truly  sought after? And now it is five o'clock.'    'Yes,' said Kangaroo. 'I wish that I hadn't. I thought you would do it  by charms and incantations, but this is a practical joke.'    'Joke!' said Nqong from his bath in the blue gums. 'Say that again and  I'll whistle up Dingo and run your hind legs off.'    'No,' said the Kangaroo. 'I must apologise. Legs are legs, and you  needn't alter 'em so far as I am concerned. I only meant to explain to  Your Lordliness that I've had nothing to eat since morning, and I'm very  empty indeed.'    'Yes,' said Dingo--Yellow-Dog Dingo,--'I am just in the same situation.  I've made him different from all other animals; but what may I have for  my tea?'    Then said Nqong from his bath in the salt-pan, 'Come and ask me about it  tomorrow, because I'm going to wash.'    So they were left in the middle of Australia, Old Man Kangaroo and  Yellow-Dog Dingo, and each said, 'That's your fault.'           THIS is the mouth-filling song       Of the race that was run by a Boomer,       Run in a single burst--only event of its kind--       Started by big God Nqong "]]]
