She loved her husband more  than ever; he was full of affection for her, and she was grateful for  his love. The past had now no shadow, the future no cloud, and the birth  of a daughter, drawing still closer the links which united them, seemed  a new pledge of felicity. Alas! the horizon which appeared so bright and  clear to the poor woman was doomed soon again to be overcast.    The very evening of the christening party, a band of musicians and  jugglers happened to pass through the village, and the inhabitants  showed themselves liberal. Pierre asked questions, and found that the  leader of the band was a Spaniard. He invited the man to his own house,  and remained closeted with him for nearly an hour, dismissing him at  length with a refilled purse. Two days later the old man announced to  the family that he was going to Picardy to see a former partner on a  matter of business, and he departed accordingly, saying he should return  before long.    The day on which Bertrande again saw her uncle was, indeed, a terrible  one. She was sitting by the cradle of the lately-born infant, watching  for its awakening, when the door opened, and Pierre Guerre strode in.  Bertrande drew back with an instinct of terror as soon as she saw him,  for his expression was at once wicked and joyful--an expression of  gratified hate, of mingled rage and triumph, and his smile was terrible  to behold. She did not venture to speak, but motioned him to a seat. He  came straight up to her, and raising his head, said loudly--    \"Kneel down at once, madame--kneel down, and ask pardon from Almighty  God!\"    \"Are you mad, Pierre?\" she replied, gazing at him in astonishment.    \"You, at least, ought to know that I am not.\"    \"Pray for forgiveness--I--! and what for, in Heaven's name?\"    \"For the crime in which you are an accomplice.\"    \"Please explain yourself.\"    \"Oh!\" said Pierre, with bitter irony, \"a woman always thinks herself  innocent as long as her sin is hidden; she thinks the truth will never  be known, and her conscience goes quietly to sleep, forgetting her  faults. Here is a woman who thought her sins nicely concealed; chance  favoured her: an absent husband, probably no more; another man so  exactly like him in height, face, and manner that everyone else is  deceived! Is it strange that a weak, sensitive woman, wearied of  widowhood, should willingly allow herself to be imposed on?\"    Bertrande listened without understanding; she tried to interrupt, but  Pierre went on--    \"It was easy to accept this stranger without having to blush for it,  easy to give him the name and the rights of a husband! She could even  appear faithful while really guilty; she could seem constant, though  really fickle; and she could, under a veil of mystery, at once reconcile  her honour, her duty--perhaps even her love.\"    \"What on earth do you mean?\" cried Bertrande, wringing her hands in  terror.    \"That you are countenancing an impostor who is not your husband.\"    Feeling as if the ground were passing from beneath her, Bertrande  staggered, and caught at the nearest piece of furniture to save herself  from falling; then, collecting all her strength to meet this  extraordinary attack, she faced the old man.    \"What! my husband, your nephew, an impostor!\"    \"Don't you know it?\" \"I!!\"    This cry, which came from her heart, convinced Pierre that she did not  know, and that she had sustained a terrible shock. He continued more  quietly--    \"What, Bertrande, is it possible you were really deceived?\"    \"Pierre, you are killing me; your words are torture. No more mystery, I  entreat. What do you know? What do you suspect? Tell me plainly at  once.\"    \"Have you courage to hear it?\"    \"I must,\" said the trembling woman.    \"God is my witness that I would willingly have kept it from you, but you  must know; if only for the safety of your soul entangled in so deadly a  snare,... there is yet time, if you follow my advice. Listen: the man  with whom you are living, who dares to call himself Martin Guerre, is a  cheat, an impostor----\"    \"How dare you say so?\"    \"Because I have discovered it. Yes, I had always a vague suspicion, an  uneasy feeling, and in spite of the marvellous resemblance I could never  feel as if he were really my sister's child. The day he raised his hand  to strike me--yes, that day I condemned him utterly.... Chance has  justified me! A wandering Spaniard, an old soldier, who spent a night in  the village here, was also present at the battle of St. Quentin, and saw  Martin Guerre receive a terrible gunshot wound in the leg. After the  battle, being wounded, he betook himself to the neighbouring village,  and distinctly heard a surgeon in the next room say that a wounded man  must have his leg amputated, and would very likely not survive the  operation. The door opened, he saw the sufferer, and knew him for Martin  Guerre. So much the Spaniard told me. Acting on this information, I went  on pretence of business to the village he named, I questioned the  inhabitants, and this is what I learned.\"    \"Well?\" said Bertrande, pale, and gasping with emotion.    \"I learned that the wounded man had his leg taken off, and, as the  surgeon predicted, he must have died in a few hours, for he was never  seen again.\"    Bertrande remained a few moments as if annihilated by this appalling  revelation; then, endeavoring to repel the horrible thought--    \"No,\" she cried, \"no, it is impossible! It is a lie intended to ruin  him-to ruin us all.\"    \"What! you do not believe me?\"    \"No, never, never!\"    \"Say rather you pretend to disbelieve me: the truth has pierced your  heart, but you wish to deny it. Think, however, of the danger to your  immortal soul.\"    \"Silence, wretched man!... No, God would not send me so terrible a  trial. What proof can you show of the truth of your words?\"    \"The witnesses I have mentioned.\"    \"Nothing more?\"    \"No, not as yet.\"    \"Fine proofs indeed! The story of a vagabond who flattered your hatred  in hope of a reward, the gossip of a distant village, the recollections  of ten years back, and finally, your own word, the word of a man who  seeks only revenge, the word of a man who swore to make Martin pay  dearly for the results of his own avarice, a man of furious passions  such as yours! No, Pierre, no, I do not believe you, and I never will!\"    \"Other people may perhaps be less incredulous, and if I accuse him  publicly----\"    \"Then I shall contradict you publicly!\" And coming quickly forward, her  eyes shining with virtuous anger--    \"Leave this house, go,\" she said; \"it is you yourself who are the  impostor--go!\"    \"I shall yet know how to convince everyone, and will make you  acknowledge it,\" cried the furious old man.    He went out, and Bertrande sank exhausted into a chair. All the strength  which had supported her against Pierre vanished as soon as she was  alone, and in spite of her resistance to suspicion, the terrible light  of doubt penetrated her heart, and extinguished the pure torch of  trustfulness which had guided her hitherto--a doubt, alas! which  attacked at once her honour and her love, for she loved with all a  woman's tender affection. Just as actual poison gradually penetrates and  circulates through the whole system, corrupting the blood and affecting  the very sources of life until it causes the destruction of the whole  body, so does that mental poison, suspicion, extend its ravages in the  soul which has received it. Bertrande remembered with terror her first  feelings at the sight of the returned Martin Guerre, her involuntary  repugnance, her astonishment at not feeling more in touch with the  husband whom she had so sincerely regretted. She remembered also, as if  she saw it for the first time, that Martin, formerly quick, lively, and  hasty tempered, now seemed thoughtful, and fully master of himself.    This change of character she had supposed due to the natural development  of age, she now trembled at the idea of another possible cause. Some  other little details began to occur to her mind--the forgetfulness or  abstraction of her husband as to a few insignificant things; thus it  sometimes happened that he did not answer to his name of Martin, also  that he mistook the road to a hermitage, formerly well known to them  both, and again that he could not answer when addressed in Basque,  although he him self had taught her the little she knew of this  language. Besides, since his return, he would never write in her  presence, did he fear that she would notice some difference? She had  paid little or no attention to these trifles; now, pieced together, they  assumed an alarming importance. An appalling terror seized Bertrande:  was she to remain in this uncertainty, or should she seek an explanation  which might prove her destruction? And how discover the truth--by  questioning the guilty man, by noting his confusion, his change of  colour, by forcing a confession from him? But she had lived with him for  two years, he was the father of her child, she could not ruin him  without ruining herself, and, an explanation once sought, she could  neither punish him and escape disgrace, nor pardon him without sharing  his guilt. To reproach him with his conduct and then keep silence would  destroy her peace for ever; to cause a scandal by denouncing him would  bring dishonour upon herself and her child. Night found her involved in  these hideous perplexities, too weak to surmount them; an icy chill came  over her, she went to bed, and awoke in a high fever. For several days  she hovered between life and death, and Martin Guerre bestowed the most  tender care upon her. She was greatly moved thereby, having one of those  impressionable minds which recognise kindness fully as much as injury.  When she was a little recovered and her mental power began to return,  she had only a vague recollection of what had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2753"],[0,"Ali Pacha (#5)"],[1,"terror-stricken.  Ali, after ordering the decapitation of Selim, whose head he seized as a  trophy, ordered the cadi, the beys, and the Greek archons to meet at the  palace, to prepare the official account of the execution of the  sentence. They assembled, trembling; the sacred hymn of the Fatahat was  sung, and the murder declared legal, in the name of the merciful and  compassionate God, Lord of the world.    When they had sealed up the effects of the victim, the murderer left the  palace, taking with him, as a hostage, Mustapha, son of Selim, destined  to be even more unfortunate than his father.    A few days afterwards, the Divan awarded to Ali Tepeleni, as a reward  for his zeal for the State and religion, the sanjak of Thessaly, with  the title of Dervendgi-pacha, or Provost Marshal of the roads. This  latter dignity was conferred on the condition of his levying a body of  four thousand men to clear the valley of the Peneus of a multitude of  Christian chiefs who exercised more power than the officers of the Grand  Seigneur. The new pacha took advantage of this to enlist a numerous body  of Albanians ready for any enterprise, and completely devoted to him.  With two important commands, and with this strong force at his back, he  repaired to Trikala, the seat of his government, where he speedily  acquired great influence.    His first act of authority was to exterminate the bands of Armatolis, or  Christian militia, which infested the plain. He laid violent hands on  all whom he caught, and drove the rest back into their mountains,  splitting them up into small bands whom he could deal with at his  pleasure. At the same time he sent a few heads to Constantinople, to  amuse the sultan and the mob, and some money to the ministers to gain  their support. \"For,\" said he, \"water sleeps, but envy never does.\"  These steps were prudent, and whilst his credit increased at court,  order was reestablished from the defiles of the Perrebia of Pindus to  the vale of Tempe and to the pass of Thermopylae.    These exploits of the provost-marshal, amplified by Oriental  exaggeration, justified the ideas which were entertained of the capacity  of Ali Pacha. Impatient of celebrity, he took good care himself to  spread his fame, relating his prowess to all comers, making presents to  the sultan's officers who came into his government, and showing  travellers his palace courtyard festooned with decapitated heads. But  what chiefly tended to consolidate his power was the treasure which he  ceaselessly amassed by every means. He never struck for the mere  pleasure of striking, and the numerous victims of his proscriptions only  perished to enrich him. His death sentences always fell on beys and  wealthy persons whom he wished to plunder. In his eyes the axe was but  an instrument of fortune, and the executioner a tax-gatherer.          CHAPTER III      Having governed Thessaly in this manner during several years, Ali found  himself in a position to acquire the province of Janina, the possession  of which, by making him master of Epirus, would enable him to crush all  his enemies and to reign supreme over the three divisions of Albania.    But before he could succeed in this, it was necessary to dispose of the  pacha already in possession. Fortunately for Ali, the latter was a weak  and indolent man, quite incapable of struggling against so formidable a  rival; and his enemy speedily conceived and put into execution a plan  intended to bring about the fulfilment of his desires. He came to terms  with the same Armatolians whom he had formerly treated so harshly, and  let them loose, provided with arms and ammunition, on the country which  he wished to obtain. Soon the whole region echoed with stories of  devastation and pillage. The pacha, unable to repel the incursions of  these mountaineers, employed the few troops he had in oppressing the  inhabitants of the plains, who, groaning under both extortion and  rapine, vainly filled the air with their despairing cries. Ali hoped  that the Divan, which usually judged only after the event, seeing that  Epirus lay desolate, while Thessaly flourished under his own  administration, would, before long, entrust himself with the government  of both provinces, when a family incident occurred, which for a time  diverted the course of his political manoeuvres.    For a long time his mother Kamco had suffered from an internal cancer,  the result of a life of depravity. Feeling that her end drew near, she  despatched messenger after messenger, summoning her son to her bedside.  He started, but arrived too late, and found only his sister Chainitza  mourning over the body of their mother, who had expired in her arms an  hour previously. Breathing unutterable rage and pronouncing horrible  imprecations against Heaven, Kamco had commanded her children, under  pain of her dying curse, to carry out her last wishes faithfully. After  having long given way to their grief, Ali and Chainitza read together  the document which contained these commands. It ordained some special  assassinations, mentioned sundry villages which, some day; were to be  given to the flames, but ordered them most especially, as soon as  possible, to exterminate the inhabitants of Kormovo and Kardiki, from  whom she had endured the last horrors of slavery.    Then, after advising her children to remain united, to enrich their  soldiers, and to count as nothing people who were useless to them, Kamco  ended by commanding them to send in her name a pilgrim to Mecca, who  should deposit an offering on the tomb of the Prophet for the repose of  her soul. Having perused these last injunctions, Ali and Chainitza  joined hands, and over the inanimate remains of their departed mother  swore to accomplish her dying behests.    The pilgrimage came first under consideration. Now a pilgrim can only be  sent as proxy to Mecca, or offerings be made at the tomb of Medina, at  the expense of legitimately acquired property duly sold for the purpose.  The brother and sister made a careful examination of the family estates,  and after long hunting, thought they had found the correct thing in a  small property of about fifteen hundred francs income, inherited from  their great-grandfather, founder of the Tepel-Enian dynasty. But further  investigations disclosed that even this last resource had been forcibly  taken from a Christian, and the idea of a pious pilgrimage and a sacred  offering had to be given up. They then agreed to atone for the  impossibility of expiation by the grandeur of their vengeance, and swore  to pursue without ceasing and to destroy without mercy all enemies of  their family.    The best mode of carrying out this terrible and self-given pledge was  that Ali should resume his plans of aggrandizement exactly where he had  left them. He succeeded in acquiring the pachalik of Janina, which was  granted him by the Porte under the title of \"arpalik,\" or conquest. It  was an old custom, natural to the warlike habits of the Turks, to bestow  the Government provinces or towns affecting to despise the authority of  the Grand Seigneur on whomsoever succeeded in controlling them, and  Janina occupied this position. It was principally inhabited by  Albanians, who had an enthusiastic admiration for anarchy, dignified by  them with the name of \"Liberty,\" and who thought themselves independent  in proportion to the disturbance they succeeded in making. Each lived  retired as if in a mountain castle, and only went out in order to  participate in the quarrels of his faction in the forum. As for the  pachas, they were relegated to the old castle on the lake, and there was  no difficulty in obtaining their recall.    Consequently there was a general outcry at the news of Ali Pacha's  nomination, and it was unanimously agreed that a man whose character and  power were alike dreaded must not be admitted within the walls of  Janina. Ali, not choosing to risk his forces in an open battle with a  warlike population, and preferring a slower and safer way to a short and  dangerous one, began by pillaging the villages and farms belonging to  his most powerful opponents. His tactics succeeded, and the very persons  who had been foremost in vowing hatred to the son of Kamco and who had  sworn most loudly that they would die rather than submit to the tyrant,  seeing their property daily ravaged, and impending ruin if hostilities  continued, applied themselves to procure peace. Messengers were sent  secretly to Ali, offering to admit him into Janina if he would undertake  to respect the lives and property of his new allies. Ali promised  whatever they asked, and entered the town by night. His first proceeding  was to appear before the cadi, whom he compelled to register and  proclaim his firmans of investiture.    In the same year in which he arrived at this dignity, really the desire  and object of Ali's whole life, occurred also the death of the Sultan  Abdul Hamid, whose two sons, Mustapha and Mahmoud, were confined in the  Old Seraglio. This change of rulers, however, made no difference to Ali;  the peaceful Selim, exchanging the prison to which his nephews were now  relegated, for the throne of their father, confirmed the Pacha of Janina  in the titles, offices, and privileges which had been conferred on him.    Established in his position by this double investiture, Ali applied  himself to the definite settlement of his claims. He was now fifty years  of age, and was at the height of his intellectual development:  experience had been his teacher, and the lesson of no single event had  been lost upon him. An uncultivated but just and penetrating mind  enabled him to comprehend facts, analyse causes, and anticipate results;  and as his heart never interfered with the deductions of his rough  intelligence, he had by a sort of logical sequence formulated an  inflexible plan of action. This man, wholly ignorant, not only of the  ideas of history but"]]]
