Indeed, it is partly  with the idea of such a possibility that I have thrown this narrative  into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary  consumer of fiction.    My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of Mr.  Wace. I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal egg of  Mr. Cave's to be in some physical, but at present quite inexplicable,  way _en rapport_, and we both believe further that the terrestrial  crystal must have been--possibly at some remote date--sent hither from  that planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs.  Possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are also on our  globe. No theory of hallucination suffices for the facts.          The Star          THE STAR      It was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made,  almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the  planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the  sun, had become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a  suspected retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news  was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose  inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor  outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a  faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause  any very great excitement. Scientific people, however, found the  intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the new  body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was quite  different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the  deflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an  unprecedented kind.    Few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation  of the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of  planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that  almost defeats the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is  space, vacant so far as human observation has penetrated, without warmth  or light or sound, blank emptiness, for twenty million times a million  miles. That is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed  before the very nearest of the stars is attained. And, saving a few  comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to  human knowledge crossed this gulf of space, until early in the twentieth  century this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter it was,  bulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the  sky into the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was clearly  visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely sensible  diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little while an  opera glass could attain it.    On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two  hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance  of this unusual apparition in the heavens. \"A Planetary Collision,\" one  London paper headed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine's opinion that  this strange new planet would probably collide with Neptune. The leader  writers enlarged upon the topic. So that in most of the capitals of the  world, on January 3rd, there was an expectation, however vague of some  imminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset  round the globe, thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see--the  old familiar stars just as they had always been.    Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead  grown pale. The Winter's dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation of  daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows  to show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw the  thing, the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going to  their work betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation  going home jaded and pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats,  and in the country, labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home,  all over the dusky quickening country it could be seen--and out at sea  by seamen watching for the day--a great white star, come suddenly into  the westward sky!    Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening  star at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere  twinkling spot of light, but a small round clear shining disc, an hour  after the day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared  and feared, telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are  foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky  Hottentots, Gold Coast negroes, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood  in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new  star.    And in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement,  rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote bodies had rushed  together, and a hurrying to and fro, to gather photographic apparatus  and spectroscope, and this appliance and that, to record this novel  astonishing sight, the destruction of a world. For it was a world, a  sister planet of our earth, far greater than our earth indeed, that had  so suddenly flashed into flaming death. Neptune it was, had been struck,  fairly and squarely, by the strange planet from outer space and the heat  of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one  vast mass of incandescence. Round the world that day, two hours before  the dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as it sank  westward and the sun mounted above it. Everywhere men marvelled at it,  but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those  sailors, habitual watchers of the stars, who far away at sea had heard  nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb  zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the  night.    And when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on  hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring eastward for the  rising of the great new star. It rose with a white glow in front of it,  like the glare of a white fire, and those who had seen it come into  existence the night before cried out at the sight of it. \"It is larger,\"  they cried. \"It is brighter!\" And, indeed the moon a quarter full and  sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison, but  scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little  circle of the strange new star.    \"It is brighter!\" cried the people clustering in the streets. But in the  dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one  another. \"_It is nearer_,\" they said. \"_Nearer!_\"    And voice after voice repeated, \"It is nearer,\" and the clicking  telegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and in a  thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type. \"It is nearer.\" Men  writing in offices, struck with a strange realisation, flung down their  pens, men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque  possibility in those words, \"It is nearer.\" It hurried along awakening  streets, it was shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet villages,  men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in  yellow-lit doorways shouting the news to the passers-by. \"It is nearer.\"  Pretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the news told jestingly  between the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest they did not  feel. \"Nearer! Indeed. How curious! How very, very clever people must be  to find out things like that!\"    Lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to  comfort themselves--looking skyward. \"It has need to be nearer, for the  night's as cold as charity. Don't seem much warmth from it if it _is_  nearer, all the same.\"    \"What is a new star to me?\" cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her  dead.    The schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it out for  himself--with the great white star, shining broad and bright through the  frost-flowers of his window. \"Centrifugal, centripetal,\" he said, with  his chin on his fist. \"Stop a planet in its flight, rob it of its  centrifugal force, what then? Centripetal has it, and down it falls into  the sun! And this--!\"    \"Do _we_ come in the way? I wonder--\"    The light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the later  watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again. And it was  now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of  itself, hanging huge in the sunset. In a South African city a great man  had married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his  bride. \"Even the skies have illuminated,\" said the flatterer. Under  Capricorn, two negro lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits,  for love of one another, crouched together in a cane brake where the  fire-flies hovered. \"That is our star,\" they whispered, and felt  strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light.    The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers  from him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white phial  there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and  active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as  ever, he had given his lecture to his students, and then had come back  at once to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a little  drawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he seemed lost  in thought. Then he went to the window, and the blind went up with a  click. Half way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys and  steeples of the city, hung the star.    He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#5)"],[1," possessing such vast proportions. Among them we  may here notice the method by which the graduated circles attached to  the telescope are brought within view of the observer. These circles are  necessarily situated at parts of the instrument which lie remote from  the eye-piece where the observer is stationed. The delicate marks and  figures are, however, easily read from a distance by a small auxiliary  telescope, which, by suitable reflectors, conducts the rays of light  from the circles to the eye of the observer.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Principle of Herschel's Refracting Telescope.]    Numerous refracting telescopes of exquisite perfection have been  produced by Messrs. Alvan Clark, of Cambridgeport, Boston, Mass. One of  their most famous telescopes is the great Lick Refractor now in use on  Mount Hamilton in California. The diameter of this object-glass is  thirty-six inches, and its focal length is fifty-six feet two inches. A  still greater effort has recently been made by the same firm in the  refractor of forty inches aperture for the Yerkes Observatory of the  University of Chicago. The telescope, which is seventy-five feet in  length, is mounted under a revolving dome ninety feet in diameter, and  in order to enable the observer to reach the eye-piece without using  very large step-ladders, the floor of the room can be raised and lowered  through a range of twenty-two feet by electric motors. This is shown in  Fig. 4, while the south front of the Yerkes Observatory is represented  in Fig. 6.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--South Front of the Yerkes Observatory, Chicago.    (_From the Astrophysical Journal, Vol. vi., No. 1._)]    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Lord Rosse's Telescope.]    Within the last few years two fine telescopes have been added to the  instrumental equipment of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, both by Sir  H. Grubb. One of these, containing a 28-inch object-glass, has been  erected on a mounting originally constructed for a smaller instrument by  Sir G. Airy. The other, presented by Sir Henry Thompson, is of 26 inches  aperture, and is adapted for photographic work.    There is a limit to the size of the refractor depending upon the  material of the object-glass. Glass manufacturers seem to experience  unusual difficulties in their attempts to form large discs of optical  glass pure enough and uniform enough to be suitable for telescopes.  These difficulties are enhanced with every increase in the size of the  discs, so that the cost has a tendency to increase at a very much  greater rate. It may be mentioned in illustration that the price paid  for the object-glass of the Lick telescope exceeded ten thousand pounds.    There is, however, an alternative method of constructing a telescope, in  which the difficulty we have just mentioned does not arise. The  principle of the simplest form of _reflector_ is shown in Fig. 5, which  represents what is called the Herschelian instrument. The rays of light  from the star under observation fall on a mirror which is both carefully  shaped and highly polished. After reflection, the rays proceed to a  focus, and diverging from thence, fall on the eye-piece, by which they  are restored to parallelism, and thus become adapted for reception in  the eye. It was essentially on this principle (though with a secondary  flat mirror at the upper end of the tube reflecting the rays at a right  angle to the side of the tube, where the eye-piece is placed) that Sir  Isaac Newton constructed the little reflecting telescope which is now  treasured by the Royal Society. A famous instrument of the Newtonian  type was built, half a century ago, by the late Earl of Rosse, at  Parsonstown. It is represented in Fig. 7. The colossal aperture of this  instrument has never been surpassed; it has, indeed, never been  rivalled. The mirror or speculum, as it is often called, is a thick  metallic disc, composed of a mixture of two parts of copper with one of  tin. This alloy is so hard and brittle as to make the necessary  mechanical operations difficult to manage. The material admits, however,  of a brilliant polish, and of receiving and retaining an accurate  figure. The Rosse speculum--six feet in diameter and three tons in  weight--reposes at the lower end of a telescope fifty-five feet long.  The tube is suspended between two massive castellated walls, which form  an imposing feature on the lawn at Birr Castle. This instrument cannot  be turned about towards every part of the sky, like the equatorials we  have recently been considering. The great tube is only capable of  elevation in altitude along the meridian, and of a small lateral  movement east and west of the meridian. Every star or nebula visible in  the latitude of Parsonstown (except those very near the pole) can,  however, be observed in the great telescope, if looked for at the right  time.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Meridian Circle.]    Before the object reaches the meridian, the telescope must be adjusted  at the right elevation. The necessary power is transmitted by a chain  from a winch at the northern end of the walls to a point near the upper  end of the tube. By this contrivance the telescope can be raised or  lowered, and an ingenious system of counterpoises renders the movement  equally easy at all altitudes. The observer then takes his station in  one of the galleries which give access to the eye-piece; and when the  right moment has arrived, the star enters the field of view. Powerful  mechanism drives the great instrument, so as to counteract the diurnal  movement, and thus the observer can retain the object in view until he  has made his measurements or finished his drawing.    Of late years reflecting telescopes have been generally made with  mirrors of glass covered with a thin film of silver, which is capable of  reflecting much more light than the surface of a metallic mirror. Among  great reflectors of this kind we may mention two, of three and five feet  aperture respectively, with which Dr. Common has done valuable work.    We must not, however, assume that for the general work in an observatory  a colossal instrument is the most suitable. The mighty reflector, or  refractor, is chiefly of use where unusually faint objects are being  examined. For work in which accurate measurements are made of objects  not particularly difficult to see, telescopes of smaller dimensions are  more suitable. The fundamental facts about the heavenly bodies have been  chiefly learned from observations obtained with instruments of moderate  optical power, specially furnished so as to enable precise measures of  position to be secured. Indeed, in the early stages of astronomy,  important determinations of position were effected by contrivances  which showed the direction of the object without any telescopic aid.    Perhaps the most valuable measurements obtained in our modern  observatories are yielded by that instrument of precision known as the  _meridian circle_. It is impossible, in any adequate account of the  Story of the Heavens, to avoid some reference to this indispensable aid  to astronomical research, and therefore we shall give a brief account of  one of its simpler forms, choosing for this purpose a great instrument  in the Paris Observatory, which is represented in Fig. 8.    The telescope is attached at its centre to an axis at right angles to  its length. Pivots at each extremity of this axis rotate upon fixed  bearings, so that the movements of the telescope are completely  restricted to the plane of the meridian. Inside the eye-piece of the  telescope extremely fine vertical fibres are stretched. The observer  watches the moon, or star, or planet enter the field of view; and he  notes by the clock the exact time, to the fraction of a second, at which  the object passes over each of the lines. A silver band on the circle  attached to the axis is divided into degrees and subdivisions of a  degree, and as this circle moves with the telescope, the elevation at  which the instrument is pointed will be indicated. For reading the  delicately engraved marks and figures on the silver, microscopes are  necessary. These are shown in the sketch, each one being fixed into an  aperture in the wall which supports one end of the instrument. At the  opposite side is a lamp, the light from which passes through the  perforated axis of the pivot, and is thence ingeniously deflected by  mirrors so as to provide the requisite illumination for the lines at the  focus.    The fibres which the observer sees stretched over the field of view of  the telescope demand a few words of explanation. We require for this  purpose a material which shall be very fine and fairly durable, as well  as somewhat elastic, and of no appreciable weight. These conditions  cannot be completely fulfilled by any metallic wire, but they are  exquisitely realised in the beautiful thread which is spun by the  spider. The delicate fibres are stretched with nice skill across the  field of view of the telescope, and cemented in their proper places.  With instruments so beautifully appointed we can understand the  precision attained in modern observations. The telescope is directed  towards a star, and the image of the star is a minute point of light.  When that point coincides with the intersection of the two central  spider lines the telescope is properly sighted. We use the word sighted  designedly, because we wish to suggest a comparison between the sighting  of a rifle at the target and the sighting of a telescope at a star.  Instead of the ordinary large bull's-eye, suppose that the target only  consisted of a watch-dial, which, of course, the rifleman could not see  at the distance of any ordinary range. But with the telescope of the  meridian circle the watch-dial would be visible even at the distance of  a mile. The meridian circle is indeed capable of such precision as a  sighting instrument that it could be pointed separately to each"]]]
