The large amount of these substances  contained in the dew is also particularly worthy of notice, and may  serve to some extent to explain its remarkably invigorating effect on  vegetation.    _Carburetted Hydrogen._--Gay-Lussac, Humboldt, and Boussingault have  shown, that when the whole of the moisture and carbonic acid have been  removed from the air, it still contains a small quantity of carbon and  hydrogen; and Saussure has rendered it probable that they exist in a  state of combination as carburetted hydrogen gas. No definite proof of  this position has, however, as yet been adduced, and the function of the  compound is entirely unknown. It is possible that the presence of carbon  and hydrogen may be due to a small quantity of organic matter; but,  whatever be its source, its amount is certainly extremely small.    _Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Phosphuretted Hydrogen._--The proportion of  these substances is almost infinitesimal; but they are pretty general  constituents of the atmosphere, and are apparently derived from the  decomposition of animal and vegetable matters.    The preceding statements lead to the important conclusion, that the  atmosphere is capable of affording an abundant supply of all the organic  elements of plants, because it not only contains nitrogen and oxygen in  the free state, but also in those forms of combination in which they are  most readily absorbed, as well as a large quantity of carbonic acid,  from which their carbon may be derived. At first sight it may indeed  appear that the quantity of the latter compound, and still more that of  ammonia, is so trifling as to be of little practical importance. But a  very simple calculation serves to show that, though relatively small,  they are absolutely large, for the carbonic acid contained in the whole  atmosphere amounts in round numbers to         2,400,000,000,000 tons,    and the ammonia, assuming it not to exceed one part in fifty millions,  must weigh         74,000,000 tons,    quantities amply sufficient to afford an abundant supply of these  elements to the whole vegetation of our globe.    _The Soil as a Source of the Organic Constituents of Plants._--When a  portion of soil is subjected to heat, it is found that it, like the  plant, consists of a combustible and an incombustible part; but while in  the plant the incombustible part or ash is small, and the combustible  large, these proportions are reversed in the soil, which consists  chiefly of inorganic or mineral matters, mixed with a quantity of  combustible or organic substances, rarely exceeding 8 or 10 per cent,  and often falling considerably short of this quantity.    The organic matter exists in the form of a substance called humus, which  must be considered here as a source of the organic constituents of  plants, independently of the general composition of the soil, which will  be afterwards discussed.    The term _humus_ is generic, and applied by chemists to a rather  numerous group of substances, very closely allied in their properties,  several of which are generally present in all fertile soils. They have  been submitted to examination by various chemists, but by none more  accurately than by Mulder and Herman, to whom, indeed, we owe almost all  the precise information we possess on the subject. The organic matters  of the soil may be divided into three great classes; the first  containing those substances which are soluble in water; the second,  those extracted by means of caustic potash; and the third, those  insoluble in all menstrua. When a soil is boiled with a solution of  caustic potash, a deep brown fluid is obtained, from which acids  precipitate a dark brown flocculent substance, consisting of a mixture  of at least three different acids, to which the names of humic, ulmic,  and geic acids have been applied. The fluid from which they have been  precipitated contains two substances, crenic and apocrenic acids, while  the soil still retains what has been called insoluble humus.    The acids above named do not differ greatly in chemical characters, but  they have been subdivided into the humic, geic, and crenic groups, which  present some differences in properties and composition. They are  compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and are characterised by so  powerful an affinity for ammonia that they are with difficulty obtained  free from that substance, and generally exist in the soil in combination  with it. They are all products of the decomposition of vegetable  matters in the soil, and are formed during their decay by a succession  of changes, which may be easily traced by observing the course of events  when a piece of wood or any other vegetable substance is exposed for a  length of time to air and moisture. It is then found gradually to  disintegrate with the evolution of carbonic acid, acquiring first a  brown and finally a black colour. At one particular stage of the process  it is converted into one or other of two substances, called humin and  ulmin, both insoluble in alkalies, and apparently identical with the  insoluble humus of the soil; but when the decomposition is more advanced  the products become soluble in alkalies, and then contain humic, ulmic,  and geic acids, and finally, by a still further progress, crenic and  apocrenic acids are formed as the result of an oxidation occurring at  certain periods of the decay.    The roots and other vegetable debris remaining in the soil undergo a  similar series of changes, and form the humus, which is found only in  the surface soil, that is to say, in the portion which is now or has at  some previous period been occupied by plants, and the quantity of humus  contained in any soil is mainly dependent on the activity of vegetation  on it. Numerous analyses of humus compounds extracted from the soil have  been made, and have served to establish a number of minor differences in  the composition even of those to which the same name has been applied,  due manifestly to the fact that their production is the result of a  gradual decomposition, which renders it impossible to extract from the  soil one pure substance, but only a variable mixture of several, so  similar to one another in properties, that their separation is very  difficult, if not impossible. For this reason great discrepancies exist  in the statements made regarding them by different observers, but this  is a matter of comparatively small importance, as their exact  composition has no very direct bearing on agricultural questions, and it  will suffice to give the names and chemical formulae of those which have  been analysed and described,--    Ulmic acid from long Frisian turf    C_{40}  H_{18}  O_{16}  Humic acid from hard turf            C_{40}  H_{15}  O_{15}  Humic acid from arable soil          C_{40}  H_{16}  O_{16}  Humic acid from a pasture field      C_{40}  H_{14}  O_{14}  Geic acid                            C_{40}  H_{15}  O_{17}  Apocrenic acid                       C_{48}  H_{12}  O_{24}  Crenic acid                          C_{24}  H_{12}  O_{16}    It is only necessary to observe further, that these formulae indicate a  close connection with woody fibre, and the continuous diminution of the  hydrogen and increase of oxygen shows that they must have been produced  by a gradually advancing decay.    The earlier chemists and vegetable physiologists attributed to the humus  of the soil a much more important function than it is now believed to  possess.    It was formerly considered to be the exclusive, or at least the chief  source of the organic constituents of plants, and by absorption through  the roots to yield to them the greater part of their nutriment. But  though this view has still some supporters, among whom Mulder is the  most distinguished, it is now generally admitted that humus is not a  _direct_ source of the organic constituents of plants, and is not  absorbed as such by their roots, although it is so _indirectly_, in as  far as the decomposition which it is constantly undergoing in the soil  yields carbonic acid, which can be absorbed. The older opinion is  refuted by many well-ascertained facts. As regards the exclusive origin  of the carbon of plants from humus, it is easy to see that this at least  cannot be true, for humus, as already stated, is itself derived solely  from the decomposition of vegetable and animal matters; and if the  plants on the earth's surface were to be supported by it alone, the  whole of their substance would have to return to the soil in the same  form, in order to supply the generation which succeeds them. But this is  very far from being the case, for the respiration of animals, the  combustion of fuel, and many other processes, are annually converting a  large quantity of these matters into carbonic acid; and if there were no  other source of carbon but the humus of the soil, the amount of  vegetable life would gradually diminish, and at length become entirely  extinct. Schleiden, who has discussed this subject very fully, has made  an approximative calculation of the total quantity of humus on the  earth's surface, and of the carbon annually converted into carbonic acid  by the respiration of man and animals, the combustion of wood for fuel,  and other minor processes; and he draws the conclusion that, if there  were no other source of carbon except humus, the quantity of that  substance existing in the soil would only support vegetation for a  period of sixty years.    The particular phenomena of vegetation also afford abundant evidence  that humus cannot be the only source of carbon. Thus Boussingault has  shown that on the average of years, the crops cultivated on an acre of  land"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#5)"],[1,"used, and that they deafened Washington with their outcry about  their injuries. That would be a fair parallel to the relations between  the Transvaal, the Uitlanders, and the British Government.    That these Uitlanders had very real and pressing grievances no one could  possibly deny. To recount them all would be a formidable task, for their  whole lives were darkened by injustice. There was not a wrong which had  driven the Boer from Cape Colony which he did not now practise himself  upon others--and a wrong may be excusable in 1835 which is monstrous in  1895. The primitive virtue which had characterised the farmers broke  down in the face of temptation. The country Boers were little affected,  some of them not at all, but the Pretoria Government became a most  corrupt oligarchy, venal and incompetent to the last degree. Officials  and imported Hollanders handled the stream of gold which came in from  the mines, while the unfortunate Uitlander who paid nine-tenths of the  taxation was fleeced at every turn, and met with laughter and taunts  when he endeavoured to win the franchise by which he might peaceably set  right the wrongs from which he suffered. He was not an unreasonable  person. On the contrary, he was patient to the verge of meekness, as  capital is likely to be when it is surrounded by rifles. But his  situation was intolerable, and after successive attempts at peaceful  agitation, and numerous humble petitions to the Volksraad, he began at  last to realise that he would never obtain redress unless he could find  some way of winning it for himself.    Without attempting to enumerate all the wrongs which embittered the  Uitlanders, the more serious of them may be summed up in this way:    1. That they were heavily taxed and provided about seven-eighths of the  revenue of the country. The revenue of the South African Republic--which  had been 154,000_l._ in 1886, when the goldfields were opened--had  grown in 1899 to four million pounds, and the country through the  industry of the new-comers had changed from one of the poorest to the  richest in the whole world (per head of population).    2. That in spite of this prosperity which they had brought, they were  left without a vote, and could by no means influence the disposal of the  great sums which they were providing. Such a case of taxation without  representation has never been known.    3. That they had no voice in the choice or payment of officials. Men of  the worst private character might be placed with complete authority over  valuable interests. The total official salaries had risen in 1899 to a  sum sufficient to pay 40_l._ per head to the entire male Boer  population.    4. That they had no control over education. Mr. John Robinson, the  Director-General of the Johannesburg Educational Council, has reckoned  the sum spent on the Uitlander schools as 650_l._ out of 63,000_l._  allotted for education, making 1_s._ 10_d._ per head per annum on  Uitlander children, and 8_l._ 6_s._ per head on Boer children--the  Uitlander, as always, paying seven-eighths of the original sum.    5. No power of municipal government. Watercarts instead of pipes, filthy  buckets instead of drains, a corrupt and violent police, a high  death-rate in what should be a health resort--all this in a city which  they had built themselves.    6. Despotic government in the matter of the Press and of the right of  public meeting.    7. Disability from service upon a jury.    8. Continual harassing of the mining interest by vexatious legislation.  Under this head come many grievances, some special to the mines and some  affecting all Uitlanders. The dynamite monopoly, by which the miners had  to pay 600,000_l._ extra per annum in order to get a worse quality of  dynamite; the liquor laws, by which the Kaffirs were allowed to be  habitually drunk; the incompetence and extortions of the State-owned  railway; the granting of concessions for numerous articles of ordinary  consumption to individuals, by which high prices were maintained; the  surrounding of Johannesburg by tolls from which the town had no  profit--these were among the economical grievances, some large, some  petty, which ramified through every transaction of life. These are the  wrongs which Mr. W. T. Stead has described as 'the twopenny-halfpenny  grievances of a handful of Englishmen.'    The manner in which the blood was sucked from the Uitlanders, and the  rapid spread of wealth among the Boer officials, may be gathered from  the list of the salaries of the State servants from the opening of the  mines to the outbreak of the war:                           L      1886             51,831      1887             99,083      1888            164,466      1889            249,641      1890            324,520      1891            332,888      1892            323,608      1893            361,275      1894            419,775      1895            570,047      1896            813,029      1897            996,959      1898          1,080,382      1899          1,216,394    which shows, as Mr. FitzPatrick has pointed out, that the salary list  had become twenty-four times what it was when the Uitlanders arrived,  and five times as much as the total revenue was then.    But outside and beyond all the definite wrongs from which they suffered,  there was a constant irritation to freeborn and progressive men,  accustomed to liberal institutions, that they should be despotically  ruled by a body of men some of whom were ignorant bigots, some of them  buffoons, and nearly all of them openly and shamelessly corrupt. Out of  twenty-five members of the First Volksraad twenty-one were, in the case  of the Selati Railway Company, publicly and circumstantially accused of  bribery, with full details of the bribes received, their date, and who  paid them. The black-list includes the present vice-president, Schalk  Burger; the vice-president of that date; Eloff, the son-in-law of  Kruger; and the secretary of the Volksraad. Apparently every man of the  executive and the legislature had his price.    A corrupt assembly is an evil master, but when it is narrow-minded and  bigoted as well, it becomes indeed intolerable. The following tit-bits  from the debates in the two Raads show the intelligence and spirit of  the men who were ruling over one of the most progressive communities in  the world:    'Pillar-boxes in Pretoria were opposed on the grounds that they were  extravagant and effeminate. Deputy Taljaard said that he could not see  why people wanted to be always writing letters; he wrote none himself.  In the days of his youth he had written a letter and had not been afraid  to travel fifty miles and more on horseback and by wagon to post it--and  now people complained if they had to go one mile.'    A debate on the possibility of decreasing the plague of locusts led to  the following enlightened discussion:    '_July 21._--Mr. Roos said locusts were a plague, as in the days of King  Pharaoh, sent by God, and the country would assuredly be loaded with  shame and obloquy if it tried to raise its hand against the mighty hand  of the Almighty.    'Messrs. Declerq and Steenkamp spoke in the same strain, quoting largely  from the Scriptures.    'The Chairman related a true story of a man whose farm was always spared  by the locusts, until one day he caused some to be killed. His farm was  then devastated.    'Mr. Stoop conjured the members not to constitute themselves terrestrial  gods and oppose the Almighty.    'Mr. Lucas Meyer raised a storm by ridiculing the arguments of the  former speakers, and comparing the locusts to beasts of prey which they  destroyed.    'Mr. Labuschagne was violent. He said the locusts were quite different  from beasts of prey. They were a special plague sent by God for their  sinfulness.'    In a further debate:    'Mr. Jan de Beer complained of the lack of uniformity in neckties. Some  wore a Tom Thumb variety, and others wore scarves. This was a state of  things to be deplored, and he considered that the Raad should put its  foot down and define the size and shape of neckties.'    The following note of a debate gives some idea of how far the  legislators were qualified to deal with commercial questions:    '_May 8._--On the application of the Sheba G. M. Co. for permission to  erect an aerial tram from the mine to the mill,    'Mr. Grobelaar asked whether an aerial tram was a balloon or whether it  could fly through the air.    'The only objection that the Chairman had to urge against granting the  tram was that the Company had an English name, and that with so many  Dutch ones available.    'Mr. Taljaard objected to the word \"participeeren\" (participate) as not  being Dutch, and to him unintelligible: \"I can't believe the word is  Dutch; why have I never come across it in the Bible if it is?\"    '_June 18._--On the application for a concession to treat tailings,    'Mr. Taljaard wished to know if the words \"pyrites\" and \"concentrates\"  could not be translated into the Dutch language. He could not understand  what it meant. He had gone to night-school as long as he had been in  Pretoria, and even now he could not explain everything to his burghers.  He thought it a shame that big hills should be made on ground under  which there might be rich reefs, and which in future might be required  for a market or outspan. He would support the recommendation on  condition that the name of the quartz should be translated into Dutch,  as there might be more in this than some of them imagined.'    Such debates as these may be amusing at a distance, but they are less  entertaining when they come from an autocrat who has complete power over  the conditions of your life.    From the fact that they were a community extremely preoccupied by their  own business, it followed that the Uitlanders were not ardent  politicians, and that they desired to have a share in the government of  the State for the purpose of making "]]]
