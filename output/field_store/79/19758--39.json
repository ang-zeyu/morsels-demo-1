[Ille haec, deposita tandem formidine, fatur:]      'Cuncta equidem tibi, Rex, fuerit quodcumque, fatebor    vera, inquit; neque me Argolica de gente negabo:    hoc primum; nec, si miserum Fortuna Sinonem    finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba finget.    Fando aliquod si forte tuas pervenit ad auris    Belidae nomen Palamedis et incluta fama    gloria, quem falsa sub proditione Pelasgi    insontem infando indicio, quia bella vetabat,    demisere neci, nunc cassum lumine lugent.    Illi me comitem et consanguinitate propinquum    pauper in arma pater primis huc misit ab annis,    dum stabat regno incolumis regumque vigebat    consiliis, et nos aliquod nomenque decusque    gessimus.  Invidia postquam pellacis Ulixi---    haud ignota loquor---superis concessit ab oris,    adflictus vitam in tenebris luctuque trahebam,    et casum insontis mecum indignabar amici.    Nec tacui demens, et me, fors si qua tulisset,    si patrios umquam remeassem victor ad Argos,    promisi ultorem, et verbis odia aspera movi.    Hinc mihi prima mali labes, hinc semper Ulixes    criminibus terrere novis, hinc spargere voces    in volgum ambiguas, et quaerere conscius arma.    Nec requievit enim, donec, Calchante ministro---    sed quid ego haec autem nequiquam ingrata revolvo?    Quidve moror, si omnis uno ordine habetis Achivos,    idque audire sat est?  Iamdudum sumite poenas,    hoc Ithacus velit, et magno mercentur Atridae.'      Tum vero ardemus scitari et quaerere causas,    ignari scelerum tantorum artisque Pelasgae.    Prosequitur pavitans, et ficto pectore fatur:      'Saepe fugam Danai Troia cupiere relicta    moliri, et longo fessi discedere bello;    fecissentque utinam! Saepe illos aspera ponti    interclusit hiemps, et terruit Auster euntis.    Praecipue, cum iam hic trabibus contextus acernis    staret equus, toto sonuerunt aethere nimbi.    Suspensi Eurypylum scitantem oracula Phoebi    mittimus, isque adytis haec tristia dicta reportat:    ''Sanguine placastis ventos et virgine caesa,    cum primum Iliacas, Danai, venistis ad oras;    sanguine quaerendi reditus, animaque litandum    Argolica.'' Volgi quae vox ut venit ad auris,    obstipuere animi, gelidusque per ima cucurrit    ossa tremor, cui fata parent, quem poscat Apollo.      'Hic Ithacus vatem magno Calchanta tumultu    protrahit in medios; quae sint ea numina divom,    flagitat; et mihi iam multi crudele canebant    artificis scelus, et taciti ventura videbant.    Bis quinos silet ille dies, tectusque recusat    prodere voce sua quemquam aut opponere morti.    Vix tandem, magnis Ithaci clamoribus actus,    composito rumpit vocem, et me destinat arae.    Adsensere omnes, et, quae sibi quisque timebat,    unius in miseri exitium conversa tulere.    Iamque dies infanda aderat; mihi sacra parari,    et salsae fruges, et circum tempora vittae:    eripui, fateor, leto me, et vincula rupi,    limosoque lacu per noctem obscurus in ulva    delitui, dum vela darent, si forte dedissent.    Nec mihi iam patriam antiquam spes ulla videndi,    nec dulcis natos exoptatumque parentem;    quos illi fors et poenas ob nostra reposcent    effugia, et culpam hanc miserorum morte piabunt.    Quod te per superos et conscia numina veri,    per si qua est quae restet adhuc mortalibus usquam    intemerata fides, oro, miserere laborum    tantorum, miserere animi non digna ferentis.'      His lacrimis vitam damus, et miserescimus ultro.    Ipse viro primus manicas atque arta levari    vincla iubet Priamus, dictisque ita fatur amicis:    'Quisquis es, amissos hinc iam obliviscere Graios;    noster eris, mihique haec edissere vera roganti:    Quo molem hanc immanis equi statuere?  Quis auctor?    Quidve petunt?  Quae religio, aut quae machina belli?'    Dixerat.  Ille, dolis instructus et arte Pelasga,    sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera palmas:        'Vos, aeterni ignes, et non violabile vestrum    testor numen' ait 'vos arae ensesque nefandi,    quos fugi, vittaeque deum, quas hostia gessi:    fas mihi Graiorum sacrata resolvere iura,    fas odisse viros, atque omnia ferre sub auras,    si qua tegunt; teneor patriae nec legibus ullis.    Tu modo promissis maneas, servataque serves    Troia fidem, si vera feram, si magna rependam.      'Omnis spes Danaum et coepti fiducia belli    Palladis auxiliis semper stetit.  Impius ex quo    Tydides sed enim scelerumque inventor Ulixes,    fatale adgressi sacrato avellere templo    Palladium, caesis summae custodibus arcis,    corripuere sacram effigiem, manibusque cruentis    virgineas ausi divae contingere vittas;    ex illo fluere ac retro sublapsa referri    spes Danaum, fractae vires, aversa deae mens.    Nec dubiis ea signa dedit Tritonia monstris.    Vix positum castris simulacrum, arsere coruscae    luminibus flammae arrectis, salsusque per artus    sudor iit, terque ipsa solo---mirabile dictu---    emicuit, parmamque ferens hastamque trementem.      'Extemplo temptanda fuga canit aequora Calchas,    nec posse Argolicis exscindi Pergama telis,    omina ni repetant Argis, numenque reducant,    quod pelago et curvis secum avexere carinis.    Et nunc, quod patrias vento petiere Mycenas,    arma deosque parant comites, pelagoque remenso    improvisi aderunt:  ita digerit omina Calchas.    Hanc pro Palladio moniti, pro numine laeso    effigiem statuere, nefas quae triste piaret.    Hanc tamen immensam Calchas attollere molem    roboribus textis caeloque educere iussit,    ne recipi portis, aut duci in moenia possit,    neu populum antiqua sub religione tueri.

Hic aliud maius miseris multoque tremendum    obicitur magis, atque improvida pectora turbat.    Laocoon, ductus Neptuno sorte sacerdos,    sollemnis taurum ingentem mactabat ad aras.    Ecce autem gemini a Tenedo tranquilla per alta---    horresco referens---immensis orbibus angues    incumbunt pelago, pariterque ad litora tendunt;    pectora quorum inter fluctus arrecta iubaeque    sanguineae superant undas; pars cetera pontum    pone legit, sinuatque immensa volumine terga.    Fit sonitus spumante salo; iamque arva tenebant,    ardentisque oculos suffecti sanguine et igni,    sibila lambebant linguis vibrantibus ora.    Diffugimus visu exsangues:  illi agmine certo    Laocoonta petunt; et primum parva duorum    corpora natorum serpens amplexus uterque    implicat, et miseros morsu depascitur artus;    post ipsum auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferentem    corripiunt, spirisque ligant ingentibus; et iam    bis medium amplexi, bis collo squamea circum    terga dati, superant capite et cervicibus altis.    Ille simul manibus tendit divellere nodos,    perfusus sanie vittas atroque veneno,    clamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit:    quales mugitus, fugit cum saucius aram    taurus, et incertam excussit cervice securim.    At gemini lapsu delubra ad summa dracones    effugiunt saevaeque petunt Tritonidis arcem,    sub pedibusque deae clipeique sub orbe teguntur.    Tum vero tremefacta novus per pectora cunctis    insinuat pavor, et scelus expendisse merentem    Laocoonta ferunt, sacrum qui cuspide robur    laeserit, et tergo sceleratam intorserit hastam.

Accingunt omnes operi, pedibusque rotarum    subiciunt lapsus, et stuppea vincula collo    intendunt:  scandit fatalis machina muros,    feta armis.

Our  drive thither was by the banks of the river Couesnon, along a sandy road,  bordered on each side by hedges of tamarisks, which leads to the \"Greve,\"  or sands, which have to be crossed to reach the Mount, a distance of  rather more than a mile. We met numbers of bare-legged half-clad women and  children, bringing in the produce of their fishing, shrimps and cockles  tied up in nets, and peasants with carts carrying in sea sand for dressing  the land. The appearance of Mont St. Michel is very imposing, a cone of  granite encircled by the sea. Above rises the fortress, surmounted by the  church, a height of 400 feet from the top to the water. Below, at the foot  of the Mount, picturesquely situated on an insulated rock, is the little  chapel of St. Aubert, Bishop of Avranches, the founder of St. Michel. The  Mount has been the residence of many of our English princes. Matilda,  queen of the Conqueror, visited St. Michel.  It was here her son Henry I.,  then only Count of the Cotentin, was blockaded by his brothers William and  Robert, and obliged to surrender. Here Henry II. held his court, and, when  Henry V. overran Normandy, St. Michel was the only fortress that held out  against him, under its gallant defender Louis d'Estouteville of  Bricquebec. Two cannons, now at the entrance of the castle, are said to  have been taken from the English at the siege. Normandy was always the  scene of the quarrels between the English Norman princes, of the disputes  between the sons of the Conqueror, between Stephen of Blois and Henry of  Anjou, and again of those between Henry II. and his sons, and of Richard  and his brother John, to the latter of whom the Normans were attached.    Seven French kings have made pilgrimages to St. Michel; and here Louis XI.  instituted the order of knighthood, called in honour of the archangel St.  Michael, but afterwards styled the order of the Coquille, from the  cockleshells that formed the collar of the knights, and the golden  cockle-shells that bordered their mantles. The motto of the order was the  old motto of the Mount, \"Immensi tremor Oceani\" (the trembling of the  immeasurable ocean), being an allusion to the popular belief that when the  English approached St. Michel, the guardian archangel of the Mount raised  a tempest to drive the enemy's vessels upon the rocks. This belief may be  traced back to the time when the island was occupied by the Druid  priestesses, who were supposed to have the power of raising storms and  stilling them by their magic arrows of gold.    We ascended by the flight of steps to the \"Merveille,\" as the convent  building is called, and well it deserves its name, from its elegance, its  boldness, and its position, with a wall of above one hundred feet high,  and of immense length, rising from the rock and supported by fifteen  buttresses, and divided into three stories. In every point of view it is  one of the most remarkable edifices of the thirteenth century. The salle  des chevaliers, where the chapters of the knights were held, is a fine  hall, with three rows of columns, and above it are the beautiful Gothic  cloisters. The \"preau\" or court is surrounded by a double row of pointed  arches, interlacing each other, and filled in with flowered spandrils and  cornices, carved with the greatest delicacy and endless variety. The  church which crowns the building is supported by a circle of enormous  columns in the crypt beneath, called the Souterrain des Gros Piliers: it  has been entirely restored, and the carvings are the work of the prisoners  who were confined here. From one of the doors we went out to the platform  or terrace called Beauregard, from the beauty of its prospect, or  sometimes Sault Gautier, from a prisoner of that name, who three times  threw himself off the platform to commit suicide. The view from hence is  most extensive, the whole circuit of the bay extending to the west as far  as Cancale. In 1203 St. Michel became a royal demesne, and the buildings  were entirely reconstructed by the Abbot Jourdan, assisted by Philip  Augustus; and the works were continued by his successors to 1260.    Beneath and adjacent to the Mount, is the little island of La Tombeleine  or tombeau d'-Helene, so called from a young lady of that name, who unable  to accompany her lover knight when he left for England with the Conqueror,  as soon as the vessel which carried him away disappeared from her sight,  laid down on the shore and died. Every year, on the anniversary of her  death, the fishermen will tell you they see a dove seated upon the  Tombeleine rock, and remain there till morning's dawn.    The guide pointed out to us the window of St. Michel, from which Barbes  tried to escape by means of a cord made of his sheets cut into strips and  tied together; but the line was too short, and he fell upon the rock and  was taken up much hurt. The provisions for the fortress are brought in up  an inclined plane, and raised by means of a tread-wheel, formerly worked  by the prisoners. We were conducted to the spot where stood, with bars  only three inches apart, the iron cage in which so many celebrities were  immured. Dubourg, the Dutch journalist, who wrote against Louis XIV., died  within its bars, devoured, it is said, by the rats. In 1777, the Comte  d'Artois (afterwards Charles X.) desired it should be destroyed, but his  wishes were disregarded. His cousin, the Duc de Chartres (afterwards Louis  Philippe), with his brother and sister, and Madame de Genlis, subsequently  visited the Mount. All exclaimed against the iron cage, and when they  heard that the Comte d'Artois had ordered its destruction, they sent for  hatchets, and the Duc de Chartres gave the first blow towards its  demolition; but the fine old fortress is no longer desecrated as a prison.  The Emperor has restored it to its original position, and it is now placed  under the control of the Bishop of Coutances, and is used as an asylum for  orphans under the care of a few Sisters.    Next morning we crossed the boundary between Normandy and Brittany, the  river Couesnon, which has often changed its course, once, it is said,  running beyond St. Michel--hence the popular saying--          \"Le Couesnon par sa folie      A mis le Mont en Normandie.\"      We had a beautiful drive to Dol or Dol-de-Bretagne, as it is styled, to  distinguish it from the fortress of the same name in the Jura, upon the  taking of which Madame de Sevigne writes in her letters with so much  enthusiasm. We were now fairly in Brittany, which though geographically  part of France still remains very distinct, owing to the Celtic origin of  its inhabitants. Brittany consists of five departments; but it is in Lower  Brittany alone, comprised in the departments of Finistere, Morbihan, and  the Cotes-du-Nord, that the true Celtic race, its language, names,  features, costumes, and superstitions are to be found.    This is the true Brittany, the Bretagne Bretonnante of Froissart, who  calls the eastern part of the province, La Bretagne Douce, because the  French language is spoken there. Dol was the great bulwark of Brittany  against Normandy; the wall and moat surrounding the town, with some of the  towers, still remain. Many of the houses are built, as the French term it,  \"en colombage\" that is, with the upper story projecting some fifteen feet  over the ground-floor, forming a gallery or porch supported by oak posts  or columns with sculptured capitals of the thirteenth century. The inn we  occupied had one of these porches: Madame Barbot, our landlady, and her  maid, were both dressed in Breton costume, with lace-trimmed embroidered  caps and aprons of fine muslin, clear-starched and ironed with a  perfection which the most accomplished \"blanchisseuse du fin\" of Paris  would find it difficult to surpass. The people here have the Breton  physiognomy, sharp black eyes, short roundi faces and brown freckled  complexions, a contrast to the blue eyes, long oval faces, and bright  tints of their Norman neighbours.    [Illustration: 7. Pilaster and Cornice from the Tomb of Bishop James,  Cathedral, Dol.]    The principal building at Dol is the Cathedral, built of grey granite, in  the style of many of our English churches. On the south is the \"porte  episcopale,\" a large projecting porch with mullioned sides, and, near it,  a smaller porch with a central column semee of hearts, the \"armes  parlantes\" of Bishop Coeuret who built it. The clustered columns of the  nave, consist of a central pillar surrounded by four others running up to  the roof, so slender and delicate that they are united to the centre by  small bars of iron. Over the high altar is an enormous wooden crozier,  carved and gilt, from which the Host is suspended. A beautiful Renaissance  tomb on the north side of the cathedral was raised in 1507 to the memory  of Bishop James, who died three years before. The sculpture is much  mutilated, but the arabesques are most delicately and elegantly chiselled.  It is supposed to be the work of Jean Just of Tours, sculptor of the  magnificent tomb of Louis XII. and Anne of Brittany, erected at St. Denis  by order of Francis I.    [Illustration: 8. Front of the Tomb of Bishop James, Cathedral, Dol.]    The chapel of St. Samson, patron saint of the cathedral, has been  restored. Mad people were brought here for cure, and placed in a recess  which still remains; the opening was covered over by an iron grating. Dol  was formerly the ecclesiastical metropolis of Brittany; the see was  founded by Samson, one of those British monks, who, with a whole  population of men and women, emigrated from England to escape the Saxon  slavery. They crossed the Channel in barks made of skins sewn together,  singing, as they went, the Lamentations of the Psalmist. This emigration  lasted more than a century (from 450 to 550), and poured a Christian  population into a Celtic country"]]]
