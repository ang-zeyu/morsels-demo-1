Every one else cried aloud for a chance to uphold Great  Britain's prestige, and the War Office was so beset with applications  from volunteers for the front that it was found almost impossible even  to consider them. Nor was the excitement confined to officers alone.  Recruiting went on apace, and not only did recruits pour in, but  deserters, who had slunk away from regimental duty, now returned and  gave themselves up, praying to be allowed to suffer any penalty and then  march out to battle as soldiers of the Queen! Two Royal Proclamations  having been issued--the one directing the continuance in army service,  until discharged or transferred to the reserve, of soldiers whose term  of service had expired or was about to expire; the other, ordering the  army reserve to be called out on permanent service--some 25,000 men  received notice to rejoin the colours. These in large numbers promptly  appeared. The New South Wales Lancers, who had been going through a  course of cavalry training at Aldershot, at once volunteered their  services and started for the Cape amidst scenes of great enthusiasm.  Other colonial troops were as eager to join, and the spirit of military  rivalry throughout Her Majesty's dominions was both amazing and  inspiriting.    Queensland had the honour of opening the ball. Her sympathy with the  policy of Great Britain and her loyalty to the mother country was shown  in practical form. She intimated, in the event of hostilities, her  willingness to send 250 mounted infantry and a machine-gun to the front.  New Zealand followed suit; she also offered two companies of mounted  rifles fully equipped at the cost of the Colony. These offers were  gratefully accepted. Not to be behind-hand, Western Australia and  Tasmania made similar offers, and Her Majesty's Government gladly agreed  to accept one unit of 125 men from each. The Parliament of Victoria  voted the despatch of a contingent of 250 men to South Africa, and the  Governments of New South Wales and South Australia actively discussed  similar measures. This expression of Colonial public opinion, embodying  as it did the independent judgments of so many free juries, uninfluenced  by personal or direct interests, had a significance which, besides being  politically important, was eminently satisfactory. All Her Majesty's  dominions, on which the sun never sets, were at this critical moment  holding hands in a wide circle that encompassed the earth, and the  picture of the small mother country with all her big children gathered  around her in her hour of need was not one that the romance of history  can afford to disregard.                                  IN SOUTH AFRICA    Before hostilities had actually begun, refugees from Johannesburg began  to pour down to Natal and the Cape, and there were daily reports of  insults received by the Uitlanders at the hands of the Boers. Ladies  were spat upon, and passengers suffered indignities sufficient to make  an Englishman's blood boil. Fresh troops began to arrive from India, and  Sir George White, in a chorus of farewell shouts, \"Remember Majuba,\"  went off from Durban to Pietermaritzburg. This was on the 7th of October  1899. At that time the troops were thus distributed:--          At Pietermaritzburg--1st Battalion Manchester Regiment and      Mounted Infantry Company; 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle      Corps.          At Estcourt--Detachment Natal Naval Volunteers; Natal Royal      Rifles.          At Colenso--Durban Light Infantry.          At Ladysmith--5th Lancers; Detachment 19th Hussars; Brigade      Division, Royal Artillery; 10th Mountain Battery, Royal Garrison      Artillery; 23rd Company, Royal Engineers; 1st Battalion      Devonshire Regiment; 1st Battalion Liverpool Regiment, and      Mounted Infantry Company; 26th (two sections) British Field      Hospital, and Colonial troops.          At Glencoe--18th Hussars; Brigade Division, Royal Artillery;      1st Battalion Leicestershire Regiment, and Mounted Infantry      Company; 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps, and Mounted      Infantry Company; 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, and      Mounted Infantry Company; 6th Veterinary Field Hospital.          There was also one Company 1st Battalion King's Royal Rifle      Corps at Eshowe, and a detachment of the Umvoti Mounted Rifles      at Helpmakaar.    Meanwhile, at Pretoria, the Boers, protesting at the notice taken of the  \"chimerical grievances of the so-called Uitlanders,\" made energetic  efforts to appoint General Viljeon, a rabid anti-Briton, in place of  General Joubert as Commander-in-Chief of the Transvaal forces.    The troops under Commandant Cronje, the hero of Potchefstroom, advanced  nearer to the border, in the direction of Mafeking, and in the  expectation of attack, this town was securely fortified, while all the  women and children were advised to leave. The fortification of Kimberley  was also commenced. The European exodus from all quarters continued,  defenceless men and women alike being subjected to insult and  ill-treatment by the Boers. Mr. Kruger's birthday was kept at Pretoria  with general rejoicing, and on the following day a telegram was sent by  President Kruger to the _New York World_ saying:--         \"Through the _World_ I thank the people of the United States       most sincerely for their sympathy. Last Monday the Republic       gave Great Britain forty-eight hours' notice within which to       give the Republic an assurance that the present dispute would       be settled by arbitration or other peaceful means, and that the       troops would be removed from the borders. This expires at five       to-day. The British Agent has been recalled. War is certain.       The Republics are determined, if they must belong to Great       Britain, that a price will have to be paid which will stagger       humanity. They have, however, full faith. The sun of liberty       will arise in South Africa as it arose in North America.\"    From this letter it was patent that Mr. Kruger was either pursuing his  policy of bluff, or had made long and elaborate preparations for war  with the British. On the same date an announcement was published in the  town of Pretoria:--                                       \"GOVERNMENT HOUSE, _October 11_.         \"Her Majesty's Agent at Pretoria was to-day instructed to make       the following communication to the Government of the South       African Republic: 'The Imperial Government have received with       great regret the peremptory demands of the Government of the       South African Republic conveyed in the telegram of October 9.       You will inform the Government of the South African Republic       that the conditions demanded by the Government of the South       African Republic are such as Her Majesty's Government deem it       impossible to discuss. With the delivery of the above,' the       Imperial Government add, 'as the Transvaal Government stated in       their Note that a refusal to comply with their demands would be       regarded as a formal declaration of war, the British Agent is       instructed to ask for his passports.'\"    Of course, this news caused intense excitement, and all who had remained  sanguine of peace now gave up hope. At Bloemfontein President Steyn  simultaneously issued a Proclamation to the Burghers of the Free State.  He said that \"the sister Republic is about to be attacked by an  unscrupulous enemy, who has long looked for a pretext to annihilate the  Afrikanders.\"    He went on to say that the people of the Orange Free State were bound to  the Transvaal by many ties, as well as by formal treaty, and solemnly  declared, in the presence of the Almighty, that they are compelled to  resist a powerful enemy owing to the injustice done to their kith and  kin.    Solemn obligations, continued the Proclamation, have not protected the  Transvaal against an annexation conspiracy. When its independence  ceases, the existence of the Orange Free State as an independent State  will be meaningless. Experience in the past has shown that no reliance  can be placed on the solemn promises and obligations of Great Britain  when the Administration at the helm is prepared to tread treaties under  foot.    After giving a historical sketch of the wrongs which he alleged had been  done to the Transvaal, President Steyn said: \"The original Conventions  have been twisted and turned by Great Britain into a means of exercising  tyranny against the Transvaal, which has not returned the injustice done  to it in the past. No gratitude has been shown for the indulgence which  was granted to British subjects, who, according to law, had forfeited  their lives and property. Compliance with the British demands would be  equivalent to the loss of our independence, which has been gained by our  blood and tears. For many years British troops have been concentrating  on the borders of the Transvaal in order to compel it by terrorism to  comply with British claims. The crafty plans of those with whom love of  gold is the motive are now being realised. While acknowledging the  honour of thousands of Englishmen who abhor deeds of robbery and  violence, the Orange Free State execrates the wrongful deeds of a  British statesman.\"    After expressing confidence that the Almighty would help and aid them,  and counselling the Burghers to do nothing unworthy of Christians and  Burghers of the Free State, the President concluded with the following  words: \"Burghers of the Free State, stand up as one man against the  oppressor and violator of right.\"    Meanwhile Sir George White, accompanied by Colonel Ian Hamilton  (Assistant Adjutant-General), Colonel Duff (Ass"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26278"],[0,"The Christian Foundation, Or, Scientific and Religious Journal, Volume 1, (#5)"],[1,"ak, barren eternities,\" viz:  life. Lost (?) in the narrow vale. Yes! He knows nothing about his  origin. He knows nothing about his destiny. So he says, and we have no  right to contradict him. He is lost! But here he is again, listen!  Speaking of the autumn leaves, he says, \"LIKE US, they disappear and are  merged into the ocean of matter from which they are evolved, ready to be  RE-COMBINED into new forms of beauty.\" (Capitals mine.) Once more he  says, \"LIKE THAT LEAF which was the hope of spring, the pride and glory  of summer, we are rudely torn away, the sport of destiny, to return to  the elements of nature from which we sprung: dust to dust.\"    How he contradicts himself! But we must make all due allowances. He is  in the presence of death. He says, \"The past is beyond recall; the  future is veiled in obscurity and in doubt; the present alone is ours.\"  Here confusion is confounded; but let us ever remember that this was a  funeral occasion, and the friends of the deceased were present, and this  man Veveu was there, for the purpose, ostensibly, of giving a small  amount of consolation to bereaved and broken hearts. Oh, how barren, how  cold, how gloomy and God-dishonoring the consolation given! Those empty  vessels of ours, hearts \"endowed with inexhaustible hope,\" must turn  away from the grave (?) _empty still_. No, not necessarily. God has  provided a fountain. Go to it and fill your vessels. Let us not be too  severe upon the man. There he stands amid bleeding hearts, and the open  tomb just before him. Show pity, Lord! The man says, \"No message ever  reached man from beyond the grave.\" How very singular it is that many  men repudiating God make a god of themselves. What kind of a being must  I be to know that \"no message ever reached man from beyond the grave?\"  How much must I know? Away back yonder in the past, in that \"mere sealed  book,\" is a grand and glorious message from beyond the grave. But to our  friend it is a \"sealed book.\"    What becomes of evolution?    What becomes of natural selection?    What becomes of the doctrine of the survival of the fittest?          THE MOTIVE THAT LED MEN TO ADOPT DARWINISM.      Before presenting the motive that led some of the great minds in  unbelief to advocate the Darwinian theory of creation, it will not be  amiss to remind the reader of the fact that the author of the \"Vestiges  of Creation\" presented the evolution theory about twenty years before  Mr. Darwin excited the public mind with the \"hypothesis.\" Men who read  the \"Vestiges\" looked upon the assumption as a speculation, but refused  its adoption until Mr. Darwin, for the purpose of setting aside the  idea of separate creations of species, improved so far upon the  \"Vestiges of Creation\" as to repudiate design in nature. Having done  this, many of the leading spirits in skepticism, with a few great minds  in unbelief, at once accepted the wild speculation. Their motive may be  seen in the following quotations: \"The eye was not made for the purpose  of seeing, or the ear for the purpose of hearing. Organisms, according  to Darwin, are like grape-shot, of which one hits something and the rest  fall wide.\" (Lay sermons, p. 331.) According to the above it appears  that Huxley regarded the evolution of species, as advocated by Darwin,  as identical with the old, effete idea that circumstances have  determined everything. Buchner says, \"According to Darwin the whole  development is due to the gradual summation of innumerable minute and  accidental operations.\" This is the same idea. Carl Vogt says, \"Darwin's  theory turns the Creator, and his occasional intervention in the  revolutions of the earth and in the production of species, without any  hesitation, out of doors, inasmuch as it does not leave the smallest  room for the agency of such a being.\" Haeckel says, \"The grand  difficulty in the way of the mechanical theory was the occurrence of  innumerable organisms, apparently, at least, indicative of design.\" He  further says, \"Some who could not believe in a creative and controlling  mind, to get over the difficulty of apparent design, adopted the idea of  a metaphysical ghost called vitality.\" He then presents his estimate of  the service of Darwin in the following words: \"The grand service  rendered by Darwin to science is that his theory enables us to account  for the appearances of design without assuming final causes, or, a mind  working for a foreseen and intended end.\"    Strauss, after making the admission that the evolution theory is a mere  guess, that it is no explanation of the cardinal points in descent,  adds: \"Nevertheless, as he has shown how miracles may be excluded, he is  to be applauded as one of the greatest benefactors of the human  race.\"--_Old Faith and New, p. 177._    The same author says: \"We philosophers and critical theologians have  spoken well when we decreed the abolition of miracles; but our decree  remained without effect, because we could not show them to be  unnecessary, inasmuch as we were unable to indicate any natural force to  take their place. Darwin has provided or indicated this natural force,  this process of nature; he has opened the door through which a happier  posterity may eject miracles forever.\"    Helmholtz says: \"Adaptation in the formation of organisms may arise  without the intervention of intelligence by the blind operation of  natural law.\" This author confounds law with cause or agent. \"Law is  nothing without an agent to operate by it.\" Law is simply a rule of  action. Let us hear Strauss once more: \"Design in nature, especially in  the department of living organisms, has ever been appealed to by those  who desire to prove that the world is not SELF-EVOLVED (capitals mine),  but the work of an intelligent Creator.\"--_Old Faith and New, p. 211._  On page 175 Strauss says of those who ridicule Darwin's evolution  hypothesis and yet deny miracles: \"How do they account for the origin of  man, and, in general, the development of the organic out of the  inorganic? Would they assume that the original man, as such, no matter  how rough and unformed, but still a man, sprang immediately out of the  inorganic, out of the sea or the slime of the Nile? They would hardly  venture to say that; then they must know that there is only the choice  between miracle, the divine hand of the Creator, and Darwin.\" According  to this statement every man is left to one of three conclusions, viz:    1. That man came up immediately _as man_ from the inorganic, or from the  slime of the Nile, or from some other slimy place. Or,    2. That man was evolved from the lowest forms of life, according to  Darwinism. Or,    3. That man was created by the divine hand, according to Christian  belief.    Reader, which will you accept. Will you dethrone the Creator?    Choose you this day between the Creator and the slime of the sea with  the sun's rays. What does Darwin know about the origin of life and  mind? I am informed that he believes in a God, who, by miracle, gave the  living unit at the base of his evolutionary series, but it seems to be  an admission for the sake merely of avoiding disaster, for he says: \"In  what manner the mental powers were first developed in the lowest  organisms is as _hopeless an inquiry_ as how life itself _first  originated_. These are problems for the distant future, if they are ever  to be solved by man.\"--_Descent of Man, p. 66._ This is an open  confession; in it all is given up.    I am now reminded of one of the last sayings of Strauss; here it is: \"We  demand for our universe the same piety which the devout man of old  demanded for his God.\" This brings us to the same standard of piety.  Then why the opposition?    Strauss denied a personal God. Of his mental condition we learn  something from these words: \"In the enormous machine of the universe,  amid the incessant whirl and hiss of its jagged iron wheels, amid the  deafening crash of its ponderous stamps and hammers--in the midst of  this whole terrific commotion, man, a helpless and defenseless creature,  finds himself placed, not secure for a moment, that on an imprudent  motion a wheel may not seize and rend him, or a hammer crush him to a  powder. This sense of abandonment is at first SOMETHING AWFUL.\"  (Capitals mine.) Reader, the religion of Jesus Christ will save you from  the terrible mental condition which is legitimate from a denial of God  and his Christ. Will you accept it and experience the fact?          SHALL WE ABANDON OUR RELIGION?      There is no counterfeit without a genuine. Even a myth is related to  something, near or remote, to which it bears some resemblance. There is  nothing of great value that is not counterfeited. There is nothing that  is not abused. Civil government has been wonderfully abused; in this  respect it has fared no better than religion. There are many forms of  civil government. There are many forms of religion. Let us ever seek the  best form in each.    We are often pointed to the blood that has been shed in religious wars;  but do unbelievers value civil government less because of the blood  which they have cost? No. That blood speaks better things. May we not  estimate civil government and religion both by the blood they have cost?    Unbelievers are very industrious in keeping before us the disagreements  among Protestants. They say, Look! they can't agree among themselves.  Well, is there any better agreement among politicians, or in civil  governments? Is there any agreement among unbelievers which would serve  as a model for us poor souls to imitate? I confess that the way is open  for improvement among Protestants in this respect, but is it not just as  open for a similar improvement among unbelievers in the scientific field  of thought? There we find Atheists, Pantheists, Deists, Polytheists and  Theists. In their history will be found an immense mass of contradictory  opinions.    Man is imperfect in many of his"]]]
