A salmon effectually aroused me by a terrific rush at my fly. I  \"struck\" hard, and the fly, after a momentary check, flew up into the  air. I am not one of those anglers who give rest to a salmon in the  belief that, after rising, he requires time to recover from his  disappointment at having failed to catch the lure. I believe in  \"sticking to\" a fish, perhaps because the first I ever hooked was one I  had bullied ceaselessly during the whole of a spring evening. And so I  tried hard and often to tempt that sportive fish again; but after the  careless, easy casting which resulted in the rise, I could not by any  means throw satisfactorily over the tail of the pool. However I tried to  do so, the line would double awkwardly as it reached the water, or would  curl back into the rapid on the near side of the \"hover,\" or the fly  would splash in a most provoking manner as it alighted on the stream. So  at last I left the riverside.    Henceforth, I attempted the same long cast whenever I passed the pool. I  lost many flies, and never again rose a fish. But I was convinced that I  had discovered a \"hover\" new to the village fishermen, till my old  friend Ianto chaffed me into the belief that the salmon I had seen was a  \"passenger,\" and, probably, a \"spent kelt\" in such a weak condition that  for it to stay in the rough water higher up the pool was impossible.    On another occasion, in early days when my ignorance of the river and of  fishing sorely troubled both Ianto and myself, as I was wading  down-stream along the edge of a pool a grilse rose, \"head and tail,\"  about twenty yards below my fly. Using my long gaff-handle as a staff, I  walked slowly towards the fish, casting carefully all the way. I was so  absorbed in my work that I did not know I was moving into deep water  till I found that my wading stockings had filled. I then stopped, and,  lengthening my line at each successive \"throw,\" sent my fly nearer and  still nearer to the grilse.    How I managed the long, straight cast that presently resulted in my fly  passing down the \"hover,\" I do not know. The grilse rose sharply at the  lure, but I \"struck\" too late. I reeled in my line, and after a few  minutes began once more to cast. Now, however, try as I might, I could  not get the line out to the distance required; it would not fall  straight and true. In desperation I endeavoured to overcome the  difficulty by sheer strength. I swung my arms aloft; my old hickory rod  creaked and groaned with the increasing strain, then snapped immediately  the tension was released with the return of the line; and, a second  afterwards, the grilse took my fly and bolted away down-stream.    All caution left me; I was \"into a fish\"--that was enough. In haste to  catch my rod-top as it slipped down the line from the butt, I made one  step forward, and fell over head and ears into a deep hole beneath the  shelf of rock on which I had been standing. When I recognised what had  happened I was clinging to an alder-root near the bank; thence,  breathless, I lifted myself till I was safe on a tree-trunk above the  pool. My rod and cap were drifting rapidly away; but, after divesting  myself of half my dripping garments, I recovered the rod in a backwater  below the neighbouring wood. All my line had been taken out, the gut  collar had been snapped, and the fly had undoubtedly been carried off  by the grilse.    In those old days of which I have elsewhere written,[1] Ianto and I  often resorted to the wide, deep pool under the farm. Sometimes, during  summer, we were there before daybreak, fishing for the salmon that only  then or in the dusk would deign to inspect our \"Dandy\" fly. And there,  in the summer nights, we frequently captured, with the natural minnow,  the big trout that wandered from the rapids to feed in the quiet waters  by the alders. Ianto knew the pool so well that even in the darkest  night he would wade along the slippery, weed-grown shelf near the raging  fall, to troll in the shadows above him. Had the old man taken one false  step he would have entered on a struggle for life compared with which my  own adventure after hooking the grilse would have been insignificant.    For several months free, happy Lutra made her daytime abode in a \"holt\"  among the alder-roots fringing this pool. She loved in the long winter  nights to hear the winnow-winnow of powerful wings as the wild ducks  circled down towards the pool, the whir of the grey lag-geese far in the  mysterious sky, and the whistle of the teal and the gurgle of the  moorhens among the weeds close by the river's brim.    Crouched on a grassy mound beside the rapids, she could see each  movement on the surface of the pool. The wild ducks splattered and  quacked as they paddled busily hither and thither, visiting each little  bay and reed-clump at the water's edge. Sometimes, surrendering  themselves wholly to sport and play, they formed little groups of two or  three; and now one group, and then another, would race, half-swimming,  half-flying, from bank to bank or from the rock to the salmon \"hover\" at  the lower end of the pool. The otter remembered her experience with the  dabchick, and believed that to capture a full-grown duck would tax her  utmost strength and cause a general alarm. Once, however, excited by the  wild ducks' sport, she slipped quietly from the mound, dived deep, and  from the river-bed shot up in the midst of the birds just as they had  congregated to settle a point of difference in a recent event, and to  discuss a second part of their sports' programme for the night.    As the birds, panic-stricken, scattered on every side, and, following  each other in two long lines that joined in the form of a wedge, flew up  into the starlit sky, Lutra watched them eagerly for a few moments;  then, without a ripple, she sank below the surface and returned to her  watch on the mound. For a while after the ducks had left the pool,  nothing could be heard but the ceaseless noise of falling water. But as  the night drew on, a moorhen ventured from the shelter of the alders,  and, like a tiny, buoyant boat, launched out into the pool. The otter,  with appetite whetted by recent sport among the ducks, again left her  hiding place and silently vanished into the stream. Borne by the  current, she reached, with scarcely an effort, a point in the swirling  depths from which she could catch a glimpse of the dim outline of the  floating bird. Then, rising swiftly, she gripped the moorhen from  beneath, dived across to the \"hover,\" and, having killed and skinned her  prey, feasted at leisure.    There were times in the second summer of her existence when Lutra, like  the wild ducks, seemed to abandon every thought of the possibility of  danger. Simply for the love of exercise and in enjoyment of the tranquil  night, she played about the pool till the dawn peeped over the hills;  then, tired of her frolic, she sought her secret \"holt,\" and, curling  her tail about her face and holding her hind-paws closely between her  fore-paws, fell asleep.    While she gambolled in the water, even her quickest movements were as  graceful as those of a salmon stemming the rapids and leaping into the  shallows above the rock. Diving into the depths, she avoided with  scarcely an effort the tangled roots and branches, that, washed thither  by the floods, had long been the dread of anglers when heavy fish were  hooked. Ceasing all exertion as she turned into the current, she floated  to the surface and was borne away down-stream. She swam at highest speed  from the tail to the throat of the pool, and drifted idly back to the  place from which she had started; then, changing her methods, she  skirted slowly the edge of the current, and with one long, straight  dive shot down from the head of the rapids to the still water near her  \"holt.\"    From playing thus about the pool, the otter learned the power of the  current, and how it hastened or retarded her while she pursued her prey.  But most of all, during the hours of the placid night, she delighted to  frolic in the torrent immediately below the rock, where, matching her  strength against that of the river, she leaped and dived and tumbled  through the foam, or, lying on her back amid a shower of spray,  stretched wide her limbs and suffered the whirlpool to draw her,  unresisting, into its vortex deep beneath the fall.    Lutra sometimes noticed, while she drifted with the current, that the  scent of her kindred lay strong at the surface not far from her \"holt.\"  One still, moonlit night the scent indicated that several full-grown  otters had at intervals come from the trout-reaches down-stream, and had  landed in a reed-bed at the lower end of the pool. It led away from the  river through the valley, along by a number of stagnant ponds in an old  garden near the farm, and thence to a point beyond a bend where the  river flowed almost parallel to its course at the pool. As the otter,  inquisitively following the line of the scent, came to the ponds, she  heard the croaking of countless frogs hidden in the duckweed that lay  over the entire surface of the water. Lutra made ample use of the  opportunity for a feast--frogs were the greatest delicacies known to  her, and she had never before found them to be so plentiful. Dawn was  breaking when, in her onward journey, she reached the river; so she  drifted around the bend, dived over the fall, and returned to her home  beneath the alder-roots.    It happened that the otters whose \"spur\" (footprints) Lutra had followed  to the frog-ponds retraced their steps towards the pool, and in doing so  suddenly discovered that the scent of a man lay strong on the trodden  grass. A villager, knowing the eagerness with which otters seek for  frogs, and that they often cross a narrow neck of land at the bend of a  stream, had for a time kept watch at the lower end of the old farm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#5)"],[1,"after they begin to grow,  which bring to prominence racial characteristics, depend upon the action  of the interstitial gland. If the gland is removed, or remains in  abeyance, the maturing of the body is prolonged or altered. Sex  differences, the more robust manifestations of males, are more emphatic  in the white than in either the black or yellow race. This is shown in  the beardless face and almost hairless body of Mongols and Negroes, and  especially in Nilotic tribes of Negroes with long, stork-like legs,  which is a manifestation of abeyance of the interstitial gland. As she  grows aged, and her sexual condition closes, woman assumes the coarser  and more masculine appearance, due to the loss of functioning of this  gland. It is the prime factor in differentiating the races of mankind.\"    Kingsley affirms, in \"Comparative Morphology of Vertebrates\" that  \"interstitial cells carries secretions in man which pass into the blood.  They apparently cause secondary male characters such as, among other  things, hair on the face and change of voice at the close of boyhood.  They govern most female characteristics.\"    We are on the eve of a tremendous revolution, which must cause a drastic  revision of all works on zoology, anatomy, genetics, physiology, and  evolution in general. The enormous investigations of glands and their  secretions have sprung up and focused since the middle of the World War  period. These investigations are rapidly resulting in a new surgery and  a new practice of medicine.        +Discoverer of New Method of Rejuvenation    Tells History+      By Dr. J. R. Brinkley    My first operation was upon a husband in a childless family, forty-six  years old, and married for sixteen years. His wife was forty-two years  old. I transplanted in him the interstitial gland of a male goat. His  health improved almost at once, and he thereafter looked and acted like  a man many years younger. Within a year he was the father of a fine baby  boy. The father continues to retain his improved vitality. The boy was  named \"Billy\" in honor of the goat.    Next a young woman came to me for the operation. I found her glands  diseased, removed them, and replaced them with the interstitial glands  of a male goat. Her recovery was speedy. A year later she gave birth to  a strong boy baby, now four months old. These were but the beginnings.  Other women desired female offspring and have received the glands of the  female goat. There are now some twenty-five cases in the hospital at  Milford receiving goat-glands.    [Illustration: THE DEMENTIA PRAECOX CASE, AND MISS LEWIS HEAD NURSE]    +Insanity Is Cured.+ In the hospital is a man who came from New York  City recently and received two male goat-glands upon his arrival. During  his past he had been in three New York Insane Asylums, and had gone to  the Mayo and other institutions. Nothing had been accomplished for his  case, and he had been told finally that he was incurable and must remain  a mental defective. He had decided to commit suicide if I failed to  remedy his condition. In thirty-six hours after the insertion of  goat-glands his temperature had risen to above 103 degrees, but became  normal twenty-four hours later, and has since remained so. His mind has  gradually cleared, he looks and feels younger, and is contemplating  marriage. The hideous dreams and nightmares which had destroyed his  sleep and rest for many past years have left him, and he now eats and  sleeps well. Apparently the cure is complete.    A case of Dementia Praecox, violent in character, was brought to me as a  result of the cure in the above case. Restraint was necessary, even to  the strapping of his hands, feet and body to the bed. He was in all  respects a typical insane asylum case, destined to remain under  restraint. The second day after two male goat glands had been inserted  he spoke to me, saying, \"Doctor, won't you please remove the straps so I  can rest comfortably? I am perfectly aware of everything now and feel as  if snatched from the grave.\" We removed his shackles and on the  following day he called for books to read. He made a beautiful  convalescence and a perfect recovery. He is now with his wife and  children at home, transacting his business as a normal and sane man.  Since 90 per cent of insanity cases and 75 per cent of divorce cases are  due to diseased glands, I may be pardoned for holding out hope to a  vast, hopeless class, numbered at over 3,000,000 Americans.    +Sterility Is Banished.+ As a rule the women who come to me for  treatment prefer to bear male children. In such cases it is essential  that they should receive the interstitial glands of the male goat. We  have in hospital at the moment, however, a childless married woman of  twenty-eight, who wishes devoutly for a female child. We found her  sterile of a natural gland and inserted the gland of a female goat. Her  transformation has been remarkable, and I am confident her first child  will be a girl.    You naturally ask about the future, which can only be premised. Women  who have received male goat-glands will continue to bear male children,  if any; those that receive the female goat glands will continue to bear  girl babies. The future carries a promise of much information to be  gleaned along this line. I cannot say what would happen if the husband  were to receive male goat glands and the wife female goat glands. Their  progeny might or might not be mixed. We will try it on any sterile  couple that desires, knowing positively that normal children of one or  both sexes will result.    Where substitution of glands of any character is essential, they should  be taken from the goat operated upon immediately before the human  implanting, and be inserted at once. Glands should not be taken from the  ape or other animal for human use. The goat is immune to tuberculosis,  He is a clean animal, full of health and vitality. Apes are very subject  to tuberculosis. One can never tell whether an ape is diseaseless or  not. It is generally unlawful to substitute our human glands, and, even  though they could be readily obtained, they are apt to be infected with  some disease.    The essential element of foods is the vitamin, a nitrogenous substance  of indeterminate nature. Without it we would starve, though eating  plenty of proteins, carbo-hydrates, fats, salts and water. Nothing will  sustain life if the vitamins are absent from the diet. Goat's milk  contains these important substances in greater abundance than any other  animal food.    +The Goat Reacts Like Human.+ The goat alone among mammals reacts to  poisons almost identically as human beings react, and the poison gases  of the war had precisely the same effect upon him as upon the soldiers.  So 1,500 goats did their bit in the war in an experimental way. These  points in his favor, and other similarities to man, are the reasons  which led me to select the goat as the best possible material in this  work. Goat-glands alone seemed to be harmonious and sympathetic when  transplanted into the human body. In other words, the hormones of goat  and man agree.    We still know less about the causes of hormones than the effects. On  account of the mutual tolerance of goat and human hormones the goat  gland speedily attaches a blood supply in the human body, and cell by  cell is replaced so that it soon functions as the original gland would  had it been present and normal. The new gland is also exceptional in  that it does not have to be placed near or at the location of the proper  human gland. It can be inserted in any place where it is not liable to  injury, even in the hip in men.[*]    It should be noted that I do not claim to make old men young again, or  that I have discovered the secret fountain of youth. I am engaged in the  practical work of giving health, normality and progeny to men and women  who have been cheated out of their natural heritage. I have named the  process \"re-creative gland operation\" in accordance with the belief now  general among genetists and anatomists that if the clock of time is ever  to be turned back for humanity it can only be through glandular  transplantations. Glands have proved much superior to any animal extract  or serum in this class of cases. Often in serums the poison elements are  retained, but not the nutritive. We use the whole goat gland, as a rule,  because we do not know in what part of it the hormones hide. The  attempted transplantations of kidneys have thus far failed because the  kidney product is waste matter, not live cells as in the case of the  interstitial glands.        [Footnote: Author's Note.--The date of this interview is more than      one year old, March, 1920. Today Dr. Brinkley implants the male      glands by incision in the acrotum of the man, and in no other      place whatever, having found this method of operation the most      sure in results. Today he uses only the male goat-glands for the      man, and only the female goat's ovaries for the woman.]        (From The Chicago Tribune, of date February 1, 1920.)      +GOAT GLANDS GIVE BABIES TO CHILDLESS.+      +Woman and Three Men Become Parents After    Transplantation.+    Milford, Kansas.--A surgeon in this little Kansas town has lifted from  womanhood the curse of sterility.
