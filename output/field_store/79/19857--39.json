Some time afterwards he  told me that he had reconsidered the question; that I had served his  family faithfully; that I deserved my freedom, and that he would take  $1200 for myself and boy.    This was joyful intelligence for me, and the reflection of hope gave a  silver lining to the dark cloud of my life--faint, it is true, but still  a silver lining.    Taking a prospective glance at liberty, I consented to marry. The  wedding was a great event in the family. The ceremony took place in the  parlor, in the presence of the family and a number of guests. Mr.  Garland gave me away, and the pastor, Bishop Hawks, performed the  ceremony, who had solemnized the bridals of Mr. G.'s own children. The  day was a happy one, but it faded all too soon. Mr. Keckley--let me  speak kindly of his faults--proved dissipated, and a burden instead of a  help-mate. More than all, I learned that he was a slave instead of a  free man, as he represented himself to be. With the simple explanation  that I lived with him eight years, let charity draw around him the  mantle of silence.    I went to work in earnest to purchase my freedom, but the years passed,  and I was still a slave. Mr. Garland's family claimed so much of my  attention--in fact, I supported them--that I was not able to accumulate  anything. In the mean time Mr. Garland died, and Mr. Burwell, a  Mississippi planter, came to St. Louis to settle up the estate. He was a  kind-hearted man, and said I should be free, and would afford me every  facility to raise the necessary amount to pay the price of my liberty.  Several schemes were urged upon me by my friends. At last I formed a  resolution to go to New York, state my case, and appeal to the  benevolence of the people. The plan seemed feasible, and I made  preparations to carry it out. When I was almost ready to turn my face  northward, Mrs. Garland told me that she would require the names of six  gentlemen who would vouch for my return, and become responsible for the  amount at which I was valued. I had many friends in St. Louis, and as I  believed that they had confidence in me, I felt that I could readily  obtain the names desired. I started out, stated my case, and obtained  five signatures to the paper, and my heart throbbed with pleasure, for I  did not believe that the sixth would refuse me. I called, he listened  patiently, then remarked:    \"Yes, yes, Lizzie; the scheme is a fair one, and you shall have my name.  But I shall bid you good-by when you start.\"    \"Good-by for a short time,\" I ventured to add.    \"No, good-by for all time,\" and he looked at me as if he would read my  very soul with his eyes.    I was startled. \"What do you mean, Mr. Farrow? Surely you do not think  that I do not mean to come back?\"    \"No.\"    \"No, what then?\"    \"Simply this: you _mean_ to come back, that is, you _mean_ so _now_, but  you never will. When you reach New York the abolitionists will tell you  what savages we are, and they will prevail on you to stay there; and we  shall never see you again.\"    \"But I assure you, Mr. Farrow, you are mistaken. I not only _mean_ to  come back, but _will_ come back, and pay every cent of the twelve  hundred dollars for myself and child.\"    I was beginning to feel sick at heart, for I could not accept the  signature of this man when he had no faith in my pledges. No; slavery,  eternal slavery rather than be regarded with distrust by those whose  respect I esteemed.    \"But--I am not mistaken,\" he persisted. \"Time will show. When you start  for the North I shall bid you good-by.\"    The heart grew heavy. Every ray of sunshine was eclipsed. With humbled  pride, weary step, tearful face, and a dull, aching pain, I left the  house. I walked along the street mechanically. The cloud had no silver  lining now. The rosebuds of hope had withered and died without lifting  up their heads to receive the dew kiss of morning. There was no morning  for me--all was night, dark night.    I reached my own home, and weeping threw myself upon the bed. My trunk  was packed, my luncheon was prepared by mother, the cars were ready to  bear me where I would not hear the clank of chains, where I would  breathe the free, invigorating breezes of the glorious North. I had  dreamed such a happy dream, in imagination had drunk of the water, the  pure, sweet crystal water of life, but now--now--the flowers had  withered before my eyes; darkness had settled down upon me like a pall,  and I was left alone with cruel mocking shadows.    The first paroxysm of grief was scarcely over, when a carriage stopped  in front of the house; Mrs. Le Bourgois, one of my kind patrons, got out  of it and entered the door. She seemed to bring sunshine with her  handsome cheery face. She came to where I was, and in her sweet way  said:    \"Lizzie, I hear that you are going to New York to beg for money to buy  your freedom. I have been thinking over the matter, and told Ma it would  be a shame to allow you to go North to _beg_ for what we should _give_  you. You have many friends in St. Louis, and I am going to raise the  twelve hundred dollars required among them. I have two hundred dollars  put away for a present; am indebted to you one hundred dollars; mother  owes you fifty dollars, and will add another fifty to it; and as I do  not want the present, I will make the money a present to you. Don't  start for New York now until I see what I can do among your friends.\"    Like a ray of sunshine she came, and like a ray of sunshine she went  away. The flowers no longer were withered, drooping. Again they seemed  to bud and grow in fragrance and beauty. Mrs. Le Bourgois, God bless her  dear good heart, was more than successful. The twelve hundred dollars  were raised, and at last my son and myself were free. Free, free! what a  glorious ring to the word. Free! the bitter heart-struggle was over.  Free! the soul could go out to heaven and to God with no chains to clog  its flight or pull it down. Free! the earth wore a brighter look, and  the very stars seemed to sing with joy. Yes, free! free by the laws of  man and the smile of God--and Heaven bless them who made me so!    The following, copied from the original papers, contain, in brief, the  history of my emancipation:--          \"I promise to give Lizzie and her son George their freedom,      on the payment of $1200.          \"ANNE P.

Any other movement  would prevent our profiting by this grace, which is given in order to  draw us into the _rest of love_.    The soul in this peaceful attitude of prayer falls into a mystic sleep,  in which all its natural powers are silenced, until that which had been  temporary becomes its permanent condition. You see that the soul is  thus led, without effort, without study, without artifice.    The heart is not a fortified place, which must be taken by cannonading  and violence: it is a kingdom of peace, which is possessed by love.  Gently following in His train, you will soon reach the degree of  _intuitive_ prayer. God asks nothing extraordinary and difficult: on the  contrary, He is most pleased with childlike simplicity.    The grandest part of religion is the most simple. It is the same with  natural things. Do you wish to get to the sea? Embark upon a river, and  insensibly and without effort you will be taken to it. Do you wish to  get to God? Take His way, so quiet, so easy, and in a little while you  will be taken to Him in a manner that will surprise you. Oh, if only you  would try it! How soon you would see that I am telling you only too  little, and that the experience would far surpass any description that  could be given! What do you fear? Why do you not throw yourself at once  into the arms of Love, who only stretched them out upon the cross in  order to take you in? What risk can there be in trusting God, and  abandoning yourself to Him? Oh, He will not deceive you, unless it be by  giving you far more than you ever expected: while those who expect  everything from themselves may well take to themselves the reproach  which God utters by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Thou art wearied in the  greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope\" (Isa. lvii.  10).          CHAPTER XI.    OF REST IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD--ITS FRUITS--INWARD SILENCE--GOD COMMANDS  IT--OUTWARD SILENCE.      The soul, being brought to this place, needs no other preparation than  that of repose: for _the presence of God_ during the day, which is the  great result of prayer, or rather prayer itself, begins to be  _intuitive_ and _almost continual_. The soul is conscious of a deep  inward happiness, and feels that God is in it more truly than it is in  itself. It has only one thing to do in order to find God, which is to  retire within itself. As soon as the eyes are closed, it finds itself in  prayer.    It is astonished at this infinite happiness; there is carried on within  it a conversation which outward things cannot interrupt. It might be  said of this method of prayer, as was said of Wisdom, \"All good things  together come to me with her\" (Wisdom of Solomon vii. 11), for virtue  flows naturally into the soul, and is practised so easily, that it seems  to be quite natural to it. It has within it a germ of life and  fruitfulness, which gives it a facility for all good, and an  insensibility to all evil. Let it then remain faithful, and seek no  other frame of mind than that of simple rest. It has only to suffer  itself to be filled with this divine effusion.    \"The Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before  Him\" (Hab. ii. 20). The reason why inward silence is so necessary is,  that Christ, being the eternal and essential Word, in order that He may  be received into the soul, there must be a disposition corresponding  with what He is. Now it is certain that in order to receive words we  must listen. Hearing is the sense given to enable us to receive the  words which are communicated to us. Hearing is rather a passive than an  active sense, receiving, and not communicating. Christ being the Word  which is to be communicated, the soul must be attentive to this Word  which speaks within it.    This is why we are so often exhorted to listen to God, and to be  attentive to His voice. Many passages might be quoted. I will be  content to mention a few: \"Hearken unto me, O my people; and give ear  unto me, O my nation\" (Isa. li. 4). \"Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob,  and all the remnant of the house of Israel\" (Isa. xlvi. 31). \"Hearken, O  daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own  people, and thy father's house; so shall the King greatly desire thy  beauty\" (Ps. xlv. 10, 11).    We must _listen_ to God, and be attentive to Him, _forgetting ourselves_  and all self-interest. These two actions, or rather passions--for this  condition is essentially a passive one--arouse in God a \"desire\" towards  the \"beauty\" He has Himself communicated.    Outward silence is extremely necessary for the cultivation of inward  silence, and it is impossible to acquire inward silence without having a  love for silence and solitude.    God tells us by the mouth of His prophet, \"I will allure her, and bring  her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart\" (marginal reading of  Hosea ii. 14).    To be inwardly occupied with God, and outwardly occupied with countless  trifles, this is impossible.    It will be a small matter to pray, and to retire within ourselves for  half an hour or an hour, if we do not retain the unction and the spirit  of prayer during the day.          CHAPTER XII.    SELF-EXAMINATION AND CONFESSION.      Self-examination should always precede confession. Those who arrive at  this degree should expose themselves to God, who will not fail to  enlighten them, and to make known to them the nature of their faults.  This examination must be conducted in peace and tranquillity, expecting  more from God than from our own research the knowledge of our sins.    When we examine ourselves with an effort, we easily make mistakes. We  \"call evil good, and good evil;\" and self-esteem easily deceives us. But  when we remain exposed to the searching gaze of God, that Divine Sun  brings to light even the smallest atoms. We must then, for  self-examination, abandon ourselves utterly to God.    When we are in this degree of prayer, God is not slow to reveal to us  all the faults we commit. We have no sooner sinned than we feel a  burning reproach.    It is God Himself who conducts an examination which nothing escapes, and  we have only to turn towards God, and suffer the pain and the correction  which He gives. As this examination by God is continual, we can no  longer examine ourselves; and if we are faithful to our abandonment to  God, we shall soon be better examined by the divine light than we could  be by all our own efforts. Experience will make this known. One thing  which often causes astonishment to the soul is, that when it is  conscious of a sin, and comes to confess it to God, instead of feeling  regret and contrition, such as it formerly felt, a sweet and gentle love  takes possession of it.    Not having experienced this before, it supposes that it ought to draw  itself out of this condition to make a definite act of contrition. But  it does not see that, by doing this, it would lose true contrition,  which is this _intuitive love_, infinitely greater than anything it  could create for itself. It is a higher action, which includes the  others, with greater perfection, though these are not possessed  distinctly.    We should not seek to do anything for ourselves when God acts more  excellently in us and for us. It is hating sin as God hates it to hate  it in this way. This love, which is the operation of God in the soul, is  the purest of all love. All we have to do then is to remain as we are.    Another remarkable thing is, that we often forget our faults, and find  it difficult to remember them; but this must not trouble us, for two  reasons: The first, that this very forgetfulness is a proof that the sin  has been atoned for, and it is better to forget all that concerns  ourselves, that we may remember God alone. The second reason is, that  God does not fail, whenever confession is needful, to show to the soul  its greatest faults, for then it is He Himself who examines it.          CHAPTER XIII.    ON READING--VOCAL PRAYER--REQUESTS.      The proper manner of reading in this degree is, as soon as we feel  attracted to meditation, to cease reading, and remain at rest.    The soul is no sooner called to inward silence, than it should cease to  utter vocal prayers; saying but little at any time, and when it does say  them, if it finds any difficulty, or feels itself drawn to silence, it  should remain silent, and make no effort to pray, leaving itself to the  guidance of the Spirit of God.    The soul will find that it cannot, as formerly, present definite  requests to God. This need not surprise it, for it is now that \"the  Spirit maketh intercession for the saints, according to the will of God.  The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should  pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us,  with groanings which cannot be uttered\" (Rom. viii. 26, 27).    We must second the designs of God, which are to strip the soul of its  own works, to substitute His in their place.    Let Him work then, and bind yourself to nothing of your own. However  good it may appear to you, it cannot be so if it comes in the way of  God's will for you. The will of God is preferable to all other good.  Seek not your own interests, but live by abandonment and by faith.    It is here that _faith_ begins to operate wonderfully in the soul.          CHAPTER XIV.    THE FAULTS COMMITTED IN THIS DEGREE--DISTRACTIONS, TEMPTATIONS--THE  COURSE TO BE PURSUED RESPECTING THEM.      As soon as we fall into a fault, or have wandered, we must turn again  within ourselves; because this fault having turned us from God, we  should as soon as possible turn towards Him, and suffer the penitence  which He Himself will give.    It is of great importance that we should not be anxious about these  faults, because the anxiety only springs from a secret pride and a love  of our own excellence. We are troubled at feeling"]]]
