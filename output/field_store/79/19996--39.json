Lord Shelburne, of course, treated the proffered support of  a writer of such accommodating principles with contempt; and the work of  Smollett, accordingly, became distinguished for its high Toryism. The  history was published in sixpenny weekly numbers, of which 20,000 copies  were sold immediately. This extraordinary popularity was created by the  artifice of the publisher. He is stated to have addressed a packet of  the specimens of the publication to every parish-clerk in England,  carriage-free, with half-a-crown enclosed as a compliment, to have them  distributed through the pews of the church: this being generally done,  many people read the specimens instead of listening to the sermon, and  the result was an universal demand for the work.           *       *       *       *       *      MAGNA CHARTA RECOVERED.    The transcript of Magna Charta, now in the British Museum, was discovered  by Sir Robert Cotton in the possession of his tailor, who was just about  to cut the precious document out into \"measures\" for his customers. Sir  Robert redeemed the valuable curiosity at the price of old parchment,  and thus recovered what had long been supposed to be irretrievably lost.           *       *       *       *       *      FOX AND GIBBON.    When Mr. Fox's furniture was sold by auction, after his decease in 1806,  amongst his books there was the first volume of his friend Gibbon's  _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_: by the title-page, it appeared  to have been presented by the author to Fox, who, on the blank leaf, had  written this anecdote of the historian:--\"The author, at Brookes's, said  there was no salvation for this country until six heads of the principal  persons in administration were laid upon the table. Eleven days after,  this same gentleman accepted a place of lord of trade under those very  ministers, and has acted with them ever since!\" Such was the avidity of  bidders for the most trifling production of Fox's genius, that, by the  addition of this little record, the book sold for three guineas.           *       *       *       *       *      DR. JOHNSON'S PRIDE.    Sir Joshua Reynolds used to relate the following characteristic anecdote  of Johnson:--About the time of their early acquaintance, they met one  evening at the Misses Cotterell's, when the Duchess of Argyll and another  lady of rank came in. Johnson, thinking that the Misses Cotterell were  too much engrossed by them, and that he and his friend were neglected  as low company, of whom they were somewhat ashamed, grew angry, and,  resolving to shock their suspected pride, by making the great visitors  imagine they were low indeed, Johnson addressed himself in a loud tone  to Reynolds, saying, \"How much do you think you and I could get in a  week if we were to work as hard as we could?\" just as though they were  ordinary mechanics.           *       *       *       *       *      LORD BYRON'S \"CORSAIR.\"    The Earl of Dudley, in his _Letters_, (1814) says:--\"To me Byron's  _Corsair_ appears the best of all his works. Rapidity of execution is  no sort of apology for doing a thing ill, but when it is done well,  the wonder is so much the greater. I am told he wrote this poem at ten  sittings--certainly it did not take him more than three weeks. He is a  most extraordinary person, and yet there is G. Ellis, who don't feel his  merit. His creed in modern poetry (I should have said _contemporary_) is  Walter Scott, all Walter Scott, and nothing but Walter Scott. I cannot  say how I hate this petty, factious spirit in literature--it is so  unworthy of a man so clever and so accomplished as Ellis undoubtedly  is.\"           *       *       *       *       *      BOOKSELLERS IN LITTLE BRITAIN.    Little Britain, anciently Breton-street, from the mansion of the Duke of  Bretagne on that spot, in more modern times became the \"Paternoster-row\"  of the booksellers; and a newspaper of 1664 states them to have published  here within four years, 464 pamphlets. One Chiswell, resident here in  1711, was the metropolitan bookseller, \"the Longman\" of his time: and  here lived Rawlinson (\"Tom Folio\" of _The Tatler_, No. 158), who stuffed  four chambers in Gray's Inn so full, that his bed was removed into the  passage. John Day, the famous early printer, lived \"over Aldersgate.\"           *       *       *       *       *      RECONCILING THE FATHERS.    A Dean of Gloucester having some merry divines at dinner with him one  day, amongst other discourses they were talking of reconciling the  Fathers on some points; he told them he could show them the best way  in the world to reconcile them on all points of difference; so, after  dinner, he carried them into his study, and showed them all the Fathers,  classically ordered, with a quart of sack betwixt each of them.           *       *       *       *       *      DR. PARR AND SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH.    Sir James once asked Dr. Parr to join him in a drive in his gig. The  horse growing restive--\"Gently, Jemmy,\" the Doctor said; \"don't irritate  him; always soothe your horse, Jemmy. You'll do better without me. Let  me down, Jemmy!\" But once safe on the ground--\"Now, Jemmy,\" said the  Doctor, \"touch him up. Never let a horse get the better of you. Touch  him up, conquer him, do not spare him. And now I'll leave you to manage  him; I'll walk back.\"           *       *       *       *       *      SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH'S HUMOUR.    Sir James Mackintosh had a great deal of humour; and, among many other  examples of it, he kept a dinner-party at his own house for two or three  hours in a roar of laughter, playing upon the simplicity of a Scotch  cousin, who had mistaken the Rev. Sydney Smith for his gallant synonym,  the hero of Acre.           *       *       *       *       *      WRITINGS OF LOPE DE VEGA.    The number of Lope de Vega's works has been strangely exaggerated by  some, but by others reduced to about one-sixth of the usual statement.  Upon this computation it will be found that some of his contemporaries  were as prolific as himself. Vincent Mariner, a friend of Lope, left  behind him 360 quires of paper full of his own compositions, in a  writing so exceedingly small, and so exceedingly bad, that no person  but himself could read it. Lord Holland has given a facsimile of Lope's  handwriting, and though it cannot be compared to that of a dramatist of  late times, one of whose plays, in the original manuscript, is said to  be a sufficient load for a porter, it is evident that one of Mariner's  pages would contain as much as a sheet of his friend's, which would, as  nearly as possible, balance the sum total. But, upon this subject, an  epigram by Quarles may be applied, written upon a more serious theme:     \"In all our prayers the Almighty does regard    The judgment of the _balance_, not the _yard_;    He loves not words, but matter; 'tis his pleasure    To buy his wares by _weight_, not by measure.\"    With regard to the quantity of Lope's writings, a complete edition of  them would not much, if at all, exceed those of Voltaire, who, in labour  of composition, for he sent nothing into the world carelessly, must  have greatly exceeded Lope. And the labours of these men shrink into  insignificance when compared to those of some of the schoolmen and of  the Fathers.           *       *       *       *       *      POPULARITY OF LOPE DE VEGA.    Other writers, of the same age with Lope de Vega, obtained a wider  celebrity. Don Quixote, during the life of its ill-requited author, was  naturalized in countries where the name of Lope de Vega was not known,  and Du Bartas was translated into the language of every reading people.  But no writer ever has enjoyed such a share of popularity.    \"Cardinal Barberini,\" says Lord Holland, \"followed Lope with veneration  in the streets; the king would stop to gaze at such a prodigy; the people  crowded round him wherever he appeared; the learned and studious thronged  to Madrid from every part of Spain to see this phoenix of their country,  this monster of literature; and even Italians, no extravagant admirers,  in general, of poetry that is not their own, made pilgrimages from their  country for the sole purpose of conversing with Lope. So associated  was the idea of excellence with his name, that it grew, in common  conversation, to signify anything perfect in its kind; and a Lope  diamond, a Lope day, or a Lope woman, became fashionable and familiar  modes of expressing their good qualities.\"    Lope's death produced an universal commotion in the court and in the  whole kingdom. Many ministers, knights, and prelates were present when  he expired; among others, the Duke of Sesa, who had been the most  munificent of his patrons, whom he appointed his executor, and who was  at the expense of his funeral, a mode by which the great men in that  country were fond of displaying their regard for men of letters. It was  a public funeral, and it was not performed till the third day after his  death, that there might be time for rendering it more splendid, and  securing a more honourable attendance. The grandees and nobles who were  about the court were all invited as mourners; a novenary or service of  nine days was performed for him, at which the musicians of the royal  chapel assisted; after which there were exequies on three successive  days, at which three bishops officiated in full pontificals; and on each  day a funeral sermon was preached by one of the most famous preachers of  the age. Such honours were paid to the memory of Lope de Vega, one of  the most prolific, and, during his life, the most popular, of all poets,  ancient or modern.           *       *       *       *       *      SWIFT'S LOVES.

He had called him Faugh-a-ballagh, which is French for clear the course,     And his colours were a vivid shade of green:    All the Dooleys and O'Donnells were on Father Riley's horse,     While the Orangemen were backing Mandarin!      It was Hogan, the dog poisoner -- aged man and very wise,     Who was camping in the racecourse with his swag,    And who ventured the opinion, to the township's great surprise,     That the race would go to Father Riley's nag.    'You can talk about your riders -- and the horse has not been schooled,     And the fences is terrific, and the rest!    When the field is fairly going, then ye'll see ye've all been fooled,     And the chestnut horse will battle with the best.      'For there's some has got condition, and they think the race is sure,     And the chestnut horse will fall beneath the weight,    But the hopes of all the helpless, and the prayers of all the poor,     Will be running by his side to keep him straight.    And it's what's the need of schoolin' or of workin' on the track,     Whin the saints are there to guide him round the course!    I've prayed him over every fence -- I've prayed him out and back!     And I'll bet my cash on Father Riley's horse!'           .    .    .    .    .      Oh, the steeple was a caution!  They went tearin' round and round,     And the fences rang and rattled where they struck.    There was some that cleared the water -- there was more fell in and drowned,     Some blamed the men and others blamed the luck!    But the whips were flying freely when the field came into view,     For the finish down the long green stretch of course,    And in front of all the flyers -- jumpin' like a kangaroo,     Came the rank outsider -- Father Riley's horse!      Oh, the shouting and the cheering as he rattled past the post!     For he left the others standing, in the straight;    And the rider -- well they reckoned it was Andy Regan's ghost,     And it beat 'em how a ghost would draw the weight!    But he weighed it, nine stone seven, then he laughed and disappeared,     Like a Banshee (which is Spanish for an elf),    And old Hogan muttered sagely, 'If it wasn't for the beard     They'd be thinking it was Andy Regan's self!'      And the poor of Kiley's Crossing drank the health at Christmastide     Of the chestnut and his rider dressed in green.    There was never such a rider, not since Andy Regan died,     And they wondered who on earth he could have been.    But they settled it among 'em, for the story got about,     'Mongst the bushmen and the people on the course,    That the Devil had been ordered to let Andy Regan out     For the steeplechase on Father Riley's horse!          The Scotch Engineer          With eyes that searched in the dark,    Peering along the line,    Stood the grim Scotchman, Hector Clark,    Driver of 'Forty-nine',    And the veldt-fire flamed on the hills ahead,    Like a blood-red beacon sign.      There was word of a fight to the north,    And a column hard-pressed,    So they started the Highlanders forth,    Without food, without rest.      But the pipers gaily played,    Chanting their fierce delight,    And the armoured carriages rocked and swayed,    Laden with men of the Scotch Brigade,    Hurrying up to the fight,    And the grim, grey Highland engineer,    Driving them into the night.      Then a signal light glowed red,    And a picket came to the track.    'Enemy holding the line ahead,    Three of our mates we have left for dead,    Only we two got back.'    And far to the north through the still night air,    They heard the rifles crack.      And the boom of a gun rang out,    Like the sound of a deep appeal,    And the picket stood in doubt    By the side of the driving-wheel.      But the Engineer looked down,    With his hand on the starting-bar,    'Ride ye back to the town,    Ye know what my orders are,    Maybe they're wanting the Scotch Brigade    Up on those hills afar.      'I am no soldier at all,    Only an engineer,    But I could not bear that the folk should say,    Over in Scotland -- Glasgow way --    That Hector Clark stayed here    With the Scotch Brigade till the foe were gone,    With ever a rail to run her on.    Ready behind!  Stand clear!      'Fireman, get you gone    Into the armoured train,    I will drive her alone;    One more trip -- and perhaps the last --    With a well-raked fire and an open blast --    Hark to the rifles again.'           .    .    .    .    .      On through the choking dark,    Never a lamp nor a light,    Never an engine spark,    Showing her hurried flight.    Over the lonely plain    Rushed the great armoured train,    Hurrying up to the fight.      Then with her living freight    On to the foe she came,    And the rifles snapped their hate,    And the darkness spouted flame.      Over the roar of the fray    The hungry bullets whined,    As she dashed through the foe that lay    Loading and firing blind,    Till the glare of the furnace burning clear    Showed them the form of the engineer,    Sharply and well defined.      Through!  They were safely through!    Hark to the column's cheer!    Surely the driver knew    He was to halt her here;    But he took no heed of the signals red,    And the fireman found, when he climbed ahead,    There on the floor of his engine -- dead,    Lay the Scotch Engineer!          Song of the Future          'Tis strange that in a land so strong,    So strong and bold in mighty youth,    We have no poet's voice of truth    To sing for us a wondrous song.      Our chiefest singer yet has sung    In wild, sweet notes a passing strain,    All carelessly and sadly flung    To that dull world he thought so vain.      'I care for nothing, good nor bad,    My hopes are gone, my pleasures fled,    I am but sifting sand,' he said:    What wonder Gordon's songs were sad!      And yet, not always sad and hard;    In cheerful mood and light of heart    He told the tale of Britomarte,    And wrote the Rhyme of Joyous Guard.      And some have said that Nature's face    To us is always sad; but these    Have never felt the smiling grace    Of waving grass and forest trees    On sunlit plains as wide as seas.      'A land where dull Despair is king    O'er scentless flower and songless bird!'    But we have heard the bell-birds ring    Their silver bells at eventide,    Like fairies on the mountain side,    The sweetest note man ever heard.      The wild thrush lifts a note of mirth;    The bronzewing pigeons call and coo    Beside their nests the long day through;    The magpie warbles clear and strong    A joyous, glad, thanksgiving song,    For all God's mercies upon earth.      And many voices such as these    Are joyful sounds for those to tell,    Who know the Bush and love it well,    With all its hidden mysteries.      We cannot love the restless sea,    That rolls and tosses to and fro    Like some fierce creature in its glee;    For human weal or human woe    It has no touch of sympathy.      For us the bush is never sad:    Its myriad voices whisper low,    In tones the bushmen only know,    Its sympathy and welcome glad.      For us the roving breezes bring    From many a blossom-tufted tree --    Where wild bees murmur dreamily --    The honey-laden breath of Spring.           .    .    .    .    .      We have no tales of other days,    No bygone history to tell;    Our tales are told where camp-fires blaze    At midnight, when the solemn hush    Of that vast wonderland, the Bush,    Hath laid on every heart its spell.      Although we have no songs of strife,    Of bloodshed reddening the land,    We yet may find achievements grand    Within the bushman's quiet life.      Lift ye your faces to the sky    Ye far blue mountains of the West,    Who lie so peacefully at rest    Enshrouded in a haze of blue;    'Tis hard to feel that years went by    Before the pioneers broke through    Your rocky heights and walls of stone,    And made your secrets all their own.      For years the fertile Western plains    Were hid behind your sullen walls,    Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls    All weatherworn with tropic rains.      Between the mountains and the sea,    Like Israelites with staff in hand,    The people waited restlessly:    They looked towards the mountains old    And saw the sunsets come and go    With gorgeous golden afterglow,    That made the West a fairyland,    And marvelled what that West might be    Of which such wondrous tales were told.      For tales were told of inland seas    Like sullen oceans, salt and dead,    And sandy deserts, white and wan,    Where never trod the foot of man,    Nor bird went winging overhead,    Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze    To wake the silence with its breath --    A land of loneliness and death.      At length the hardy pioneers    By rock and crag found out the way,    And woke with voices of to-day,    A silence kept for years and years.      Upon the Western slope they stood    And saw -- a wide expanse of plain    As far as eye could stretch or see    Go rolling westward endlessly.    The native grasses, tall as grain,    Were waved and rippled in the breeze;    From boughs of blossom-laden trees    The parrots answered back again.    They saw the land that it was good,    A land of fatness all untrod,    And gave their silent thanks to God.      The way is won!  The way is won!    And straightway from the barren coast    There came a westward-marching host,    That aye and ever onward prest    With eager faces to the West,    Along the pathway of the sun.      The mountains saw them marching by:    They faced the all-consuming drought,    They would not rest in settled land:    But, taking each his life in hand,    Their faces ever westward bent    Beyond the farthest settlement,    Responding to the challenge cry    Of 'better country further out.'      And lo a miracle! the land    But yesterday was all unknown,    The wild man's"]]]
