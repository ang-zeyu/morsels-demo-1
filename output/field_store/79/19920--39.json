You  came in so hurriedly that I had not time to see whom I was talking to.  My house is rather lonely; I am alone; ill-disposed people might easily  take advantage of these circumstances to plunder a poor woman who has  little enough to lose. The times are so bad! You seem tired. Will you  inhale some essence?\"    \"Give me only a glass of water.\"    Louise Goillard went into the adjoining room, and returned with an ewer.  The marquis affected to rinse his lips, and said--    \"I come from a great distance on a most important matter. Be assured  that I shall be properly grateful for your services.\"    He felt in his pocket, and pulled out a purse, which he rolled between  his fingers.    \"In the first place; you must swear to the greatest secrecy.\"    \"There is no need of that with us,\" said Louise Goillard; \"that is the  first condition of our craft.\"    \"I must have more express guarantees, and your oath that you will reveal  to no one in the world what I am going to confide to you.\"    \"I give you my word, then, since you demand it; but I repeat that this  is superfluous; you do not know me.\"    \"Consider that this is a most serious matter, that I am as it were  placing my head in your hands, and that I would lose my life a thousand  times rather than see this mystery unravelled.\"    \"Consider also,\" bluntly replied the midwife, \"that we ourselves are  primarily interested in all the secrets entrusted to us; that an  indiscretion would destroy all confidence in us, and that there are even  cases----You may speak.\"    When the marquis had reassured her as to himself by this preface, he  continued: \"I know that you are a very able woman.\"    \"I could indeed wish to be one, to serve you.\".    \"That you have pushed the study of your art to its utmost limits.\"    \"I fear they have been flattering your humble servant.\"    \"And that your studies have enabled you to predict the future.\"    \"That is all nonsense.\"    \"It is true; I have been told so.\"    \"You have been imposed upon.\"    \"What is the use of denying it and refusing to do me a service?\"    Louise Goillard defended herself long: she could not understand a man of  this quality believing in fortune-telling, which she practised only with  low-class people and rich farmers; but the marquis appeared so earnest  that she knew not what to think.    \"Listen,\" said he, \"it is no use dissembling with me, I know all. Be  easy; we are playing a game in which you are laying one against a  thousand; moreover, here is something on account to compensate you for  the trouble I am giving.\"    He laid a pile of gold on the table. The matron weakly owned that she  had sometimes attempted astrological combinations which were not always  fortunate, and that she had been only induced to do so by the  fascination of the phenomena of science. The secret of her guilty  practices was drawn from her at the very outset of her defence.    \"That being so,\" replied the marquis, \"you must be already aware of the  situation in which I find myself; you must know that, hurried away by a  blind and ardent passion, I have betrayed the confidence of an old lady  and violated the laws of hospitality by seducing her daughter in her own  house; that matters have come to a crisis, and that this noble damsel,  whom I Love to distraction, being pregnant, is on the point of losing  her life and honour by the discovery of her fault, which is mine.\"    The matron replied that nothing could be ascertained about a person  except from private questions; and to further impose upon the marquis,  she fetched a kind of box marked with figures and strange emblems.  Opening this, and putting together certain figures which it contained,  she declared that what the marquis had told her was true, and that his  situation was a most melancholy one. She added, in order to frighten  him, that he was threatened by still more serious misfortunes than those  which had already overtaken him, but that it was easy to anticipate and  obviate these mischances by new consultations.    \"Madame,\" replied the marquis, \"I fear only one thing in the world, the  dishonour of the woman I love. Is there no method of remedying the usual  embarrassment of a birth?\"    \"I know of none,\" said the matron.    \"The young lady has succeeded in concealing her condition; it would be  easy for her confinement to take place privately.\"    \"She has already risked her life; and I cannot consent to be mixed up in  this affair, for fear of the consequences.\"    \"Could not, for instance,\" said the marquis, \"a confinement be effected  without pain?\"    \"I don't know about that, but this I do\" know, that I shall take very  good care not to practise any method contrary to the laws of nature.\"    \"You are deceiving me: you are acquainted with this method, you have  already practised it upon a certain person whom I could name to you.\"    \"Who has dared to calumniate me thus? I operate only after the decision  of the Faculty. God forbid that I should be stoned by all the  physicians, and perhaps expelled from France!\"    \"Will you then let me die of despair? If I were capable of making a bad  use of your secrets, I could have done so long ago, for I know them. In  Heaven's name, do not dissimulate any longer, and tell me how it is  possible to stifle the pangs of labour. Do you want more gold? Here it  is.\" And he threw more Louis on the table.    \"Stay,\" said the matron: \"there is perhaps a method which I think I have  discovered, and which I have never employed, but I believe it  efficacious.\"    \"But if you have never employed it, it may be dangerous, and risk the  life of the lady whom I love.\"    \"When I say never, I mean that I have tried it once, and most  successfully. Be at your ease.\"    \"Ah!\" cried the marquis, \"you have earned my everlasting gratitude!  But,\" continued he, \"if we could anticipate the confinement itself, and  remove from henceforth the symptoms of pregnancy?\"    \"Oh, sir, that is a great crime you speak of!\"    \"Alas!\" continued the marquis, as if speaking to himself in a fit of  intense grief; \"I had rather lose a dear child, the pledge of our love,  than bring into the world an unhappy creature which might possibly cause  its mother's death.\"    \"I pray you, sir, let no more be said on the subject; it is a horrible  crime even to think of such a thing.\"    \"But what is to be done? Is it better to destroy two persons and perhaps  kill a whole family with despair? Oh, madame, I entreat you, extricate  us from this extremity!\"    The marquis buried his face in his hands, and sobbed as though he were  weeping copiously.    \"Your despair grievously affects me,\" said the matron; \"but consider  that for a woman of my calling it is a capital offence.\"    \"What are you talking about? Do not our mystery, our safety, and our  credit come in first?    \"They can never get at you till after the death and dishonour of all  that is dear to me in the world.\"    \"I might then, perhaps. But in this case you must insure me against  legal complications, fines, and procure me a safe exit from the  kingdom.\"    \"Ah! that is my affair. Take my whole fortune! Take my life!\"    And he threw the whole purse on the table.    \"In this case, and solely to extricate you from the extreme danger in  which I see you placed, I consent to give you a decoction, and certain  instructions, which will instantly relieve the lady from her burden. She  must use the greatest precaution, and study to carry out exactly what I  am about to tell you. My God! only such desperate occasions as this one  could induce me to---- Here----\"    She took a flask from the bottom of a cupboard, and continued--    \"Here is a liquor which never fails.\"    \"Oh, madame, you save my honour, which is dearer to me than life! But  this is not enough: tell me what use I am to make of this liquor, and in  what doses I am to administer it.\"    \"The patient,\" replied the midwife, \"must take one spoonful the first  day; the second day two; the third----\"    \"You will obey me to the minutest particular?\"    \"I swear it.\"    \"Let us start, then.\"    She asked but for time to pack a little linen, put things in order, then  fastened her doors, and left the house with the marquis. A quarter of an  hour later they were galloping through the night, without her knowing  where the marquis was taking her.    The marquis reappeared three days later at the chateau, finding the  count's family as he had left them--that is to say, intoxicated with  hope, and counting the weeks, days, and hours before the accouchement of  the countess. He excused his hurried departure on the ground of the  importance of the business which had summoned him away; and speaking of  his journey at table, he related a story current in the country whence  he came, of a surprising event which he had all but witnessed. It was  the case of a lady of quality who suddenly found herself in the most  dangerous pangs of labour. All the skill of the physicians who had been  summoned proved futile; the lady was at the point of death; at last, in  sheer despair, they summoned a midwife of great repute among the  peasantry, but whose practice did not include the gentry. From the first  treatment of this woman, who appeared modest and diffident to a degree,  the pains ceased as if by enchantment; the patient fell into an  indefinable calm languor, and after some hours was delivered of a  beautiful infant; but after this was attacked by a violent fever which  brought her to death's door. They then again had recourse to the  doctors, notwithstanding the opposition of the master of the house, who  had confidence in the matron. The doctors' treatment only made matters  worse. In this extremity they again called in the midwife, and at the  end of three weeks the lady was miraculously restored to life, thus,  added the marquis, establishing the reputation of the matron, who had  sprung into such vogue in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2755"],[0,"Murat (#5)"],[1," the boat;  the king seized one, sprang forward, and reached the rope-ladder: he was  saved.    Blancard and Langlade immediately followed. Donadieu waited until the  last, as was his duty, and as he put his foot on the ladder he felt the  other boat begin to go under; he turned round with all a sailor's calm,  and saw the gulf open its jaws beneath him, and then the shattered boat  capsized, and immediately disappeared. Five seconds more, and the four  men who were saved would have been lost beyond recall! [These details  are well known to the people of Toulon, and I have heard them myself a  score of times during the two stays that I made in that town during 1834  and 1835. Some of the people who related them had them first-hand from  Langlade and Donadieu themselves.]    Murat had hardly gained the deck before a man came and fell at his feet:  it was a Mameluke whom he had taken to Egypt in former years, and had  since married at Castellamare; business affairs had taken him to  Marseilles, where by a miracle he had escaped the massacre of his  comrades, and in spite of his disguise and fatigue he had recognised his  former master.    His exclamations of joy prevented the king from keeping up his  incognito. Then Senator Casabianca, Captain Oletta, a nephew of Prince  Baciocchi, a staff-paymaster called Boerco, who were themselves fleeing  from the massacres of the South, were all on board the vessel, and  improvising a little court, they greeted the king with the title of  \"your Majesty.\" It had been a sudden embarkation, it brought about a  swift change: he was no longer Murat the exile; he was Joachim, the King  of Naples. The exile's refuge disappeared with the foundered boat; in  its place Naples and its magnificent gulf appeared on the horizon like a  marvellous mirage, and no doubt the primary idea of the fatal expedition  of Calabria was originated in the first days of exultation which  followed those hours of anguish. The king, however, still uncertain of  the welcome which awaited him in Corsica, took the name of the Count of  Campo Melle, and it was under this name that he landed at Bastia on the  25th August. But this precaution was useless; three days after his  arrival, not a soul but knew of his presence in the town.    Crowds gathered at once, and cries of \"Long live Joachim!\" were heard,  and the king, fearing to disturb the public peace, left Bastia the same  evening with his three companions and his Mameluke. Two hours later he  arrived at Viscovato, and knocked at the door of General Franceschetti,  who had been in his service during his whole reign, and who, leaving  Naples at the same time as the king, had gone to Corsica with his wife,  to live with his father-in-law, M. Colonna Cicaldi.    He was in the middle of supper when a servant told him that a stranger  was asking to speak to him--he went out, and found Murat wrapped in a  military greatcoat, a sailor's cap drawn down on his head, his beard  grown long, and wearing a soldier's trousers, boots, and gaiters.    The general stood still in amazement; Murat fixed his great dark eyes on  him, and then, folding his arms:--    \"Franceschetti,\" said he, \"have you room at your table for your general,  who is hungry? Have you a shelter under your roof for your king, who is  an exile?\"    Franceschetti looked astonished as he recognised Joachim, and could only  answer him by falling on his knees and kissing his hand. From that  moment the general's house was at Murat's disposal.    The news of the king's arrival had hardly been handed about the  neighbourhood before officers of all ranks hastened to Viscovato,  veterans who had fought under him, Corsican hunters who were attracted  by his adventurous character; in a few days the general's house was  turned into a palace, the village into a royal capital, the island into  a kingdom.    Strange rumours were heard concerning Murat's intentions. An army of  nine hundred men helped to give them some amount of confirmation. It was  then that Blancard, Donadieu, and Langlade took leave of him; Murat  wished to keep them, but they had been vowed to the rescue of the exile,  not to the fortunes of the king.    We have related how Murat had met one of his former Mamelukes, a man  called Othello, on board the Bastia mailboat. Othello had followed him  to Viscovato, and the ex-King of Naples considered how to make use of  him. Family relations recalled him naturally to Castellamare, and Murat  ordered him to return there, entrusting to him letters for persons on  whose devotion he could depend. Othello started, and reached his  father-in-law's safely, and thought he could confide in him; but the  latter was horror-struck, and alarmed the police, who made a descent on  Othello one night, and seized the letters.    The next day each man to whom a letter was addressed was arrested and  ordered to answer Murat as if all was well, and to point out Salerno as  the best place for disembarking: five out of seven were dastards enough  to obey; the two remaining, who were two Spanish brothers, absolutely  refused; they were thrown into a dungeon.    However, on the 17th September, Murat left Viscovato; General  Franceschetti and several Corsican officers served as escort; he took  the road to Ajaccio by Cotone, the mountains of Serra and Bosco, Venaco  and Vivaro, by the gorges of the forest of Vezzanovo and Bogognone; he  was received and feted like a king everywhere, and at the gates of the  towns he was met by deputations who made him speeches and saluted him  with the title of \"Majesty\"; at last, on the 23rd September, he arrived  at Ajaccio. The whole population awaited him outside the walls, and his  entry into the town was a triumphal procession; he was taken to the inn  which had been fixed upon beforehand by the quartermasters. It was  enough to turn the head of a man less impressionable than Murat; as for  him, he was intoxicated with it. As he went into the inn he held out his  hand to Franceschetti.    \"You see,\" he said, \"what the Neapolitans will do for me by the way the  Corsicans receive me.\"    It was the first mention which had escaped him of his plans for the  future, and from that very day he began to give orders for his  departure.    They collected ten little feluccas: a Maltese, named Barbara, former  captain of a frigate of the Neapolitan navy, was appointed  commander-in-chief of the expedition; two hundred and fifty men were  recruited and ordered to hold themselves in readiness for the first  signal.    Murat was only waiting for the answers to Othello's letters: they  arrived on the afternoon of the 28th. Murat invited all his officers to  a grand dinner, and ordered double pay and double rations to the men.    The king was at dessert when the arrival of M. Maceroni was announced to  him: he was the envoy of the foreign powers who brought Murat the answer  which he had been awaiting so long at Toulon. Murat left the table and  went into another room. M. Maceroni introduced himself as charged with  an official mission, and handed the king the Emperor of Austria's  ultimatum. It was couched in the following terms:        \"Monsieur Maceroni is authorised by these presents to announce to       King Joachim that His Majesty the Emperor of Austria will afford him       shelter in his States on the following terms:--         \"1. The king is to take a private name.  The queen having adopted       that of Lipano, it is proposed that the king should do likewise.         \"2. It will be permitted to the king to choose a town in Bohemia,       Moravia, or the Tyrol, as a place of residence.  He could even       inhabit a country house in one of these same provinces without       inconvenience.         \"3. The king is to give his word of honour to His Imperial and Royal       Majesty that he will never leave the States of Austria without the       express-permission of the Emperor, and that he is to live like a       private gentleman of distinction, but submitting to the laws in force       in the States of Austria.         \"In attestation whereof, and to guard against abuse, the undersigned       has received the order of the Emperor to sign the present       declaration.         \"(Signed) PRINCE OF METTERNICH         \"PARIS, 1st Sept.  1815.\"    Murat smiled as he finished reading, then he signed to M. Maceroni to  follow him:    He led him on to the terrace of the house, which looked over the whole  town, and over which a banner floated as it might on a royal castle.  From thence they could see Ajaccio all gay and illuminated, the port  with its little fleet, and the streets crowded with people, as if it  were a fete-day.    Hardly had the crowd set eyes on Murat before a universal cry arose,  \"Long live Joachim, brother of Napoleon! Long live the King of Naples!\"    Murat bowed, and the shouts were redoubled, and the garrison band played  the national airs.      M. Maceroni did not know how to believe his own eyes and ears.    When the king had enjoyed his astonishment, he invited him to go down to  the drawing-room. His staff were there, all in full uniform: one might  have been at Caserte or at Capo di Monte. At last, after a moment's  hesitation, Maceroni approached Murat.    \"Sir,\" he said, \"what is my answer to be to His Majesty the Emperor of  Austria?\"    \"Sir,\" answered Murat, with the lofty dignity which sat so well on his  fine face, \"tell my brother Francis what you have seen and heard, and  add that I am setting out this very night to reconquer my kingdom of  Naples.\"          III--PIZZO      The letters which had made Murat resolve to leave Corsica had been  brought to him by a Calabrian named Luidgi. He had presented himself to  the king as the envoy of the Arab, Othello, who had been thrown into  prison in Naples, as we have related, as well as the seven recipients of  the letters.    The answers, written by the head of the Neapolitan police, indicated the  port of Salerno as "]]]
