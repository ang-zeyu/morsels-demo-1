The small rod brace is flattened at both  ends and a hole drilled in each to fasten it with screws as shown. The  brass strip is bent in the middle at right angles and drilled to receive  screws for fastening it in the corner of the upright and horizontal  pieces.          A DICTIONARY AND MAGAZINE STAND      The accompanying picture shows a stand that is intended primarily for  holding a large-size dictionary. The shelves may be utilized for holding  books, magazines or sheet music. It will stand wear best if made of some  hard wood, such as oak. Of the soft woods chestnut has the best grain  for finishing, being hardly distinguishable from red oak.    The following pieces will be necessary:      2 sides, 3/4 by 16 by 38-1/2 in., S-4-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 15-1/2 by 21 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 14 by 17 in., S-2-S.    1 shelf, 3/4 by 13-1/2 by 21 in., S-2-S.    1 top, 3/4 by 13 by 17 in., S-2-S.    1 lip, 3/8 by 3/4 by 17 in., S-4-S.    8 keys, 3/4 by 1 by 3-1/2 in., S-2-S.    Begin work on the sides by preparing a joint edge on each piece and from  this square up the lower ends and square lines across the inner  surfaces to indicate the positions of the lower edges of the shelves.    Next, smooth off the mill marks from the broad surfaces of the shelves  and square them to size on one edge and the two ends.    [Illustration: Detail of the Dictionary and Magazine Stand]    [Illustration: Stand Made in Oak]    Return to the side pieces and lay out the outline, but do not cut to  these lines until the gains and mortises which are to receive the ends  of the shelves and their tenons have been laid out and cut. Laying out  these outlines at this time is done so as to give the exact width the  shelves are to have. These dimensions can be determined by measuring  across the sides between the outlines at the points where the shelves  are to be placed.    The shelves which have no tenons are to be let into the sides 1/4 in.  They should be shouldered 1/2 in. back from the edge so that the groove  will not show on the face.    The lip on the front of the top shelf may be fastened by means of very  small brads, the heads of which should be covered with putty, colored to  match the finish.    A suitable finish may be obtained as follows:    First see that all the mill marks are removed, using a smooth plane and  steel scraper and sandpaper, then apply a coat of cathedral-oak water  stain. When dry, sandpaper lightly, using No. 00 paper. Apply a second  coat of stain, diluting it by the addition of an equal volume of water.  This is to produce a stronger contrast. Sand this lightly and put on a  very thin coat of shellac to bind the filler and to prevent the stain in  the filler which follows from discoloring the high lights. Sand this  lightly and put on a coat of paste filler according to the directions  that will be found on the can. This filler should be colored in the  following proportions: Light paste filler, 20 lb.; Van Dyke brown, 1 lb.  After the filler has hardened, sand it lightly and put on a coat of  orange shellac. Follow this with several coats of some good rubbing  varnish. The first coats should be rubbed with haircloth or curled hair,  and the last with powdered pumice stone and raw linseed or crude oil.          A LEATHER BACK ARM CHAIR      [Illustration: Arm Chair Complete]    [Illustration: Detail of the Arm Chair]    A mission arm chair of simple design and construction is shown in the  accompanying illustration. This chair is suitable for any room of the  house and can be made of wood to match other furniture. Quarter-sawed  oak is the wood most generally used, and it is also very easy to obtain.  The stock can be ordered from the mill, cut to length, squared and  sanded. Following is a list of the material that will be needed:      2 front legs, 2 by 2 by 26-3/4 in.    2 back legs, 2 by 4 by 43 in.    2 arm rests, 1 by 4 by 26 in.    5 rails, 3/4 by 4 by 21-1/2 in.    5 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 2-1/2 in. .    2 back pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 16-1/2 in.    1 piece leather, 31 in, square.    1 piece burlap, 28 in, square.    2 pieces leather, 13 by 18 in.    2 pieces burlap, 13 by 18 in.    1 box 8 oz. tacks.    5-1/2 doz. ornamental nails.    Start with the front legs. Cut a tenon 1-1/4 in. square and 3/4 in, long  on one end to fit the arm rests. The mortises for the side rails are cut  1/2 in. wide and 7/8 in, deep. The tenons on the rails are cut to fit  these mortises, care being taken to get them all the same length between  shoulders. The back legs are cut with an offset of 2 in. as shown in the  detail drawing and also have mortises cut in them for the back  crosspieces. The upright pieces in the back are fastened into the  crosspieces by means of tenons and mortises, and should be in place when  the crosspieces are fastened to the legs.    The arms are cut from the 1 by 4 by 26-in. pieces. Be careful to get  them so they will pair. The outside edge can be either curved or  straight as desired. The front ends of the arms are held in place by  mortises which fit over the tenons on the ends of the front legs, while  the back ends are held in place by round-headed screws as shown.    The chair is now ready to be glued. Be sure to get the parts together  perfectly square, and when dry scrape off all surplus glue around the  joints, for stain will not adhere to glue and a white spot will be the  result of failing to remove it. Go over the parts carefully with fine  sandpaper and remove all rough marks. Then apply the stain you wish to  use. To make the seat, first fit boards in the bottom and nail them to  the side rails as shown. Fill the space with hair or elastic cotton felt  to about 3 in. above the edge of the rails. Bind this down tightly with  a piece of burlap and tack the edges to the rails. Cut out the corners  of the burlap so that it will fit about the posts. Put the leather on  over this and tack the edges to the bottoms of the rails. Then finish  with the ornamental nails as shown.    To finish the back, first tack a piece of burlap over the opening, then  place a layer of hair or cotton felt on this about 1 in. thick. Stretch  the leather over this and fasten with ornamental nails. The back side is  finished in the same manner, except that the hair is omitted.          A WALL SHELF      Coarse-grained woods make up into furniture and take a more satisfactory  finish than close-grained woods. For this reason chestnut or oak is  suggested for this shelf. Chestnut has a beautiful grain and is soft and  easily worked.    There will be needed the following pieces:      Sides, 2 pieces, 3/4 by 7-1/4 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.    Lower shelf, 1 piece, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.    Upper shelf, 1 piece, 3/4 by 4-3/4 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.    Lower back, 1 piece, 3/8 by 3-1/2 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.    Upper back, 1 piece, 3/8 by 3 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.    In making out this stock bill the pieces have been specified 1/4 in.  wider and 1/2 in, longer than the finished piece is to be to allow for  squaring up. The thicknesses are specified mill-planed exact so that all  that is necessary is to merely plane off the mill-marks from the two  broad surfaces.    It is quite possible that one may have a particular space or a  particular set of books to place in the shelf. In such a case the length  of the horizontals should be lengthened or shortened to meet the  particular demands when ordering the lumber.    [Illustration: Complete Wall Shelf]    Begin work by squaring the horizontals to size. They are to be all of  the same length. Next shape up the end pieces. The amount of slope for  the front edges is indicated on the drawing. After all these pieces have  been squared up and the mill-marks removed, the dadoes or grooves and  gains may be laid out and cut.    Beginners are prone to underestimate the importance of getting all the  mill-marks off before putting on any finish. When boards are planed at  the mill the planing is done by means of two or four knives revolving  above or below the board--sometimes both above and below at the same  time. These knives leave the surfaces filled with little ridges and  hollows across the grain. These hollows, though they are hardly visible  to the eye on the unfinished surface, show up as ugly streaks upon the  surface after it has had a finish of stain and filler applied.    The joints here used are typical and the beginner can readily find how  they are to be made from any good book on wood-working.    [Illustration: Wall Shelf Detail]    There are several ways of fastening the parts. They may be fastened by  means of round-head blued screws. They may be fastened with carriage  screws. The one in the illustration was put together with ordinary wire  nails and the heads of these covered with ornamental heads to represent  old-fashioned hand-wrought nails.    It will be found easier to apply the finish of stain and filler before  the parts are assembled. A suitable finish is obtained as follows: After  the parts are thoroughly sanded, put on a coat of Filipino water stain,  wiping it off with an old cloth before it has had time to soak into the  wood very much. Allow this to dry. Then sand lightly, using No. 00  paper, after which fill the pores of the wood with a black paste  filler--directions will be found on the can. Follow this, when hardened,  with several coats of floor wax.          A PEDESTAL      The pedestal shown in the accompanying illustration is another piece of  furniture that can be made in the mission style. It is very simple in  design and construction, and can be made by anyone who has a few simple  tools and a slight knowledge of their use. It is best to make it of  quarter-sawed oak as this is the most easily procured wood and also  looks the best when finished. If you order the material from the mill  ready cut to length, squared and sanded, much hard labor will be saved.  Following is a list of the material needed: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23667"],[0,"Woodland Tales (#5)"],[1,"a shock when he found that every flower was  in the _shape of a cross_, which put them beyond his power to blight. He  was furious at not being able to destroy its beauty, so did the worst he  could. Keeping away from the cross he bit a piece out of the edge of  every snowy flower leaf, and then jumped back to the Honey Locust tree.    The Locust was ashamed when she found that she had helped Diablo to do  such a mean bit of mischief, so she grew a bristling necklace of strong  spikes to wear; they were so long and sharp that no one since, not even  Diablo himself, has ever been able to climb that Honey Locust tree.    But it was too late to save the Dogwood bloom. The bites were out, and  they never healed up again, as you can see to this very day.      TALE 9    The Woolly-bear    [Illustration: The Woolly-bear (the moth is 1-1/4 life size)]    Do you know the Woolly-bear Caterpillar? It is divided into three parts;  the middle one brown, the two ends black. Everyone notices the  Woolly-bear, because it comes out in early spring, as soon as the frost  is over, and crawls on the fences and sidewalks as though they belonged  to it. It does not seem to be afraid of any one or anything. It will  march across the road in front of a motor car, or crawl up the leg of  your boot. Sometimes when you brush it off with your hand, little  hairs are left sticking in your fingers, because it is really like a  small porcupine, protected by short spears sticking out of its skin in  all directions. Here at the side of the picture, is one of these hairs  seen under a microscope.    Where did the Woolly-bear come from? It was hatched from an egg last  summer.    And now what is going to happen? It will stuff itself with rib-grass or  other low plants, till it has grown bigger; then it will get a warning  from the All-mother to prepare for the great change. In some low dry  place under a log, stone or fence-rail, it will spin a cocoon with its  own spikey hairs outside for a protector. In this rough hairy coffin it  will roll itself up, for its \"little death,\" as the Indians call it, and  Mother Carey will come along with her sleeping wand, and touch it, so it  will go into sound sleep, but for only a few days. One bright sunny  morning old Mother Carey comes around again, touches the Woolly-bear  bundle-baby, and out of it comes the Woolly-bear, only now it is changed  like the Prince in the story into a beautiful Moth called the  Tiger-Moth! Out he comes, and if you look up at one end of the coffin he  is leaving, you may see the graveclothes he wore when first he went to  sleep. Away he flies now to seek his beautiful mate, and soon she lays a  lot of eggs, from each of which will come another little Woolly-bear to  grow into a big Woolly-bear, and do it all over again.      TALE 10    How the Violets Came            The Meadow she was sorry          For her sister Sky, you see,          'Cause, though her robe of blue was bright,          'Twas plain as it could be.            And so she sent a skylark up          To trim the Sky robe right          With daisies from the Meadow          (You can see them best at night).            And every scrap of blue cut out          To make those daisies set          Came tumbling down upon the grass          And grew a violet.      TALE 11    Cocoons    Everyone loves to go a-hunting. Our forebears were hunters for so many  ages that the hunting spirit is strong in all of us, even though held in  check by the horror of giving pain to a fellow being. But the pleasure  of being outdoors, of seeking for hidden treasures, of finding something  that looks at first like old rubbish, and then turns out to be a  precious and beautiful thing, that is ours by right of the old  law--finders, keepers. That is a kind of hunting that every healthy  being loves, and there are many ways and chances for you to enjoy it.    Go out any time between October and April, and look in all the low trees  and high bushes for the little natural rag-bundles called \"cocoons.\"  Some are bundle-shaped and fast to a twig their whole length. Some hang  like a Santa Claus bag on a Christmas tree; but all may be known by  their hairiness or the strong, close cover of fine gray or brown fibre  or silk, without seams and woven to keep out the wet.    [Illustration: Cocoons]    They are so strongly fastened on, that you will have to break the twig  to get the bundle down. If it seems very light, and rattled when you  shake it, you will likely see one or more small, sharp, round holes in  it. This means that an insect enemy has destroyed the little creature  sleeping within. If the Cocoon is perfect and seems solid and heavy,  take it home, and put it in a cardboard, or wooden box, which has a wire  screen, or gauze cover. Keep it in a light place, not too dry, till the  springtime comes; then one day a miracle will take place. The case will  be cut open from within, and out will come a gorgeous Moth. It is like  the dull, dark grave opening up at the resurrection to let forth a  new-born, different being with wings to fly in the heavens above.    In the drawing I have shown five different kinds of bundle-baby, then at  the bottom have added the jug-handled bundle-baby of the Tomato worm; it  does not make a Cocoon but buries itself in the ground when the time  comes for the Great Sleep. Kind Mother Earth protects it as she does the  Hickory Horn-Devil, so it does not need to make a Cocoon at all.    There is a wonderful story about each of these bundle-babies. You will  never get weary if you follow and learn them, for each one differs from  the last. Some of them I hope to tell you in this book, and before we  begin I want you to know some of the things that men of science have  learned, and why a Butterfly is not a Moth.      TALE 12    Butterflies and Moths    Do you remember the dear old fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast? How  Beauty had to marry the Beast to save her father's life? But as soon as  she had bravely agreed to sacrifice herself--as soon as she gave the  fateful \"Yes\" the Beast stood up on his hind legs, his horns, hoofs and  hide rolled off, and he was turned back into his true shape, a splendid  young Prince whom she could not help loving; and they lived happy ever  after.    Do you know that just such transformations and happy weddings are going  on about us all the time? The Beast is an ugly Caterpillar, the Princess  Beauty is the Butterfly or the Moth. And when the Beast is changed into  the Prince Charming and meets with Princess Beauty, they are just as  madly happy as they tell it in the fairy books. I know it, for I have  seen the transformation, and I have seen the pair go off on their  wedding flight.    Men of science have been trying to explain these strange  transformations, and to discover why the Prince and Princess do not need  to eat or drink, once they have won their highest form, their life of  wings and joy. But they have not got much farther than giving names to  the things we have long loved and seen as children, dividing the winged  wonders into two big families called Butterflies and Moths.    Do you know the difference between a Butterfly and a Moth?    Taken together they make a large group that are called Scale-wings,  because they alone among insects, have scales or tiny feathers like dust  on the wings. Butterflies are Scale-wings that fly by day, and have  club-shaped feelers; they mostly fold one wing against the other when  they alight, and in the chrysalis, or bundle-baby stage, they are naked  and look like an African ear-drop.    Moths are Scale-wings that fly by night, and have switch or  feather-shaped feelers; they keep their wings spread open when they  alight, and in the bundle-baby stage, they are wrapped in a cocoon.  There are some that do not keep to these rules, but they are rare, and  the shape of the feelers will tell whether it is a Moth or a Butterfly.    All of these Scale-wings are hatched from eggs, and come first, as a  worm, grub, or caterpillar; next as a chrysalis pupa or bundle-baby;  last as the winged creature. That is, first a Beast and last a Beauty.  Each of them must at one time be the ugly one, before the great change  comes. But I must tell you a truth that the Fairy Books left out, and  which maybe you have guessed--Princess Beauty too was at one time forced  to live and look like a Beast, till she had fought her own fight, had  worked out her own high destiny, and won her way to wings.      TALE 13    The Mourning-cloak Butterfly, or the Camberwell Beauty    There was once a lady who dwelt in Camberwell. She was so good to see  that people called her \"The Camberwell Beauty.\" She dressed so  magnificently that her robe was covered with gold, and spangled with  precious stones of most amazing colours. Especially proud was she, of  the row of big blue diamonds that formed the border; and she loved to go  forth into the world to see and be seen; although she knew that the  country was full of robbers who would be sure to steal her jewels if  they could. Then she made a clever plan, she kept on the beautiful  things that she loved to dress in, but over all she hung a black velvet  mourning cloak which nobody could possibly want to steal. Then she went  up and down the roads as much as she pleased.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: Mourning-cloak Butterfly (3/4 life size)]    Well, this story may be not quite true, but it is partly true, and the  beautiful lady is known to-day as the Mourning-cloak Butterfly. There it  is, plain to be seen, the black mourning cloak, but peeping from under  it, you can see the golden border and some of the blue diamonds too,  if you look very carefully.    In the North Woods where I spent my young days, the first butterfly to  be seen in the springtime was the Mourning-cloak, and the reason we saw  it so early in the season, yes, even in the snowtime, was because this  is one"]]]
