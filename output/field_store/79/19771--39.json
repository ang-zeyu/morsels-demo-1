There was trouble, too, about the title to much of the land in Kentucky,  while Indiana offered special inducements to settlers in that new  territory.    In his carpenter work, Thomas Lincoln had learned how to build a  flatboat, and had made at least one trip to New Orleans on a craft  which he himself had put together. So, when he finally decided in the  fall of 1816 to emigrate to Indiana, he at once began to build another  boat, which he launched on the Rolling Fork, at the mouth of Knob Creek,  about half a mile from his own cabin. He traded his farm for what  movable property he could get, and loaded his raft with that and his  carpenter tools. Waving good-bye to his wife and two children, he  floated down the Rolling Fork, Salt River, and out into the Ohio River,  which proved too rough for his shaky craft, and it soon went to pieces.    After fishing up the carpenter tools and most of his other effects, he  put together a crazy raft which held till he landed at Thompson's Ferry,  Perry County, in Southern Indiana. Here he unloaded his raft, left his  valuables in the care of a settler named Posey and journeyed on foot  through the woods to find a good location. After trudging about sixteen  miles, blazing a trail, he found a situation which suited him well  enough, he thought. Then he walked all the way back to the Kentucky home  they were about to leave.    He found his wife, with Sarah, aged nine, and Abraham, aged seven, ready  to migrate with him to a newer wilderness. The last thing Nancy Lincoln  had done before leaving their old home was to take the brother and  sister for a farewell visit to the grave of \"the little boy that died.\"      OVER IN INDIANA    The place the father had selected for their home was a beautiful spot.  They could build their cabin on a little hill, sloping gently down on  all sides. The soil was excellent, but there was one serious  drawback--there was no water fit to drink within a mile! Thomas Lincoln  had neglected to observe this most important point while he was  prospecting. His wife, or even little Abe, would have had more common  sense. That was one reason why Thomas Lincoln, though a good man, who  tried hard enough at times, was always poor and looked down upon by his  thrifty neighbors.    Instead of taking his wife and children down the three streams by boat,  as he had gone, the father borrowed two horses of a neighbor and \"packed  through to Posey's,\" where he had left his carpenter tools and the other  property he had saved from the wreck of his raft. Abe and Sarah must  have enjoyed the journey, especially camping out every night on the  way. The father's skill as a marksman furnished them with tempting  suppers and breakfasts of wild game.    On the horses they packed their bedding and the cooking utensils they  needed while on the journey, and for use after their arrival at the new  home. This stock was not large, for it consisted only of \"one oven and  lid, one skillet and lid, and some tinware.\"    After they came to Posey's, Thomas Lincoln hired a wagon and loaded it  with the effects he had left there, as well as the bedding and the  cooking things they had brought with them on the two horses. It was a  rough wagon ride, jolting over stumps, logs, and roots of trees. An  earlier settler had cut out a path for a few miles, but the rest of the  way required many days, for the father had to cut down trees to make a  rough road wide enough for the wagon to pass. It is not likely that Abe  and Sarah minded the delays, for children generally enjoy new  experiences of that sort. As for their mother, she was accustomed to all  such hardships; she had learned to take life as it came and make the  best of it.    Nancy Lincoln needed all her Christian fortitude in that Indiana  home--if such a place could be called a home. At last they reached the  chosen place, in the \"fork\" made by Little Pigeon Creek emptying into  Big Pigeon Creek, about a mile and a half from a settlement which was  afterward called Gentryville.    As it was late in the fall, Thomas Lincoln decided not to wait to cut  down big trees and hew logs for a cabin, so he built a \"half-faced  camp,\" or shed enclosed on three sides, for his family to live in that  winter. As this shed was made of saplings and poles, he put an ax in  Abe's hands, and the seven-year-old boy helped his father build their  first \"home\" in Indiana. It was Abe's first experience in the work that  afterward made him famous as \"the rail splitter.\" It was with the ax, as  it were, that he hewed his way to the White House and became President  of the United States.    Of course, little Abe Lincoln had no idea of the White House then. He  may never have heard of \"the President's Palace,\" as it used to be  called--for the White House was then a gruesome, blackened ruin, burned  by the British in the War of 1812. President Madison was living in a  rented house nearby, while the Executive Mansion was being restored.  The blackened stone walls, left standing after the fire, were _painted  white_, and on that account the President's mansion came to be known as  \"the White House.\"    Little Abe, without a thought of his great future, was getting ready for  it by hacking away at poles and little trees and helping his father in  the very best way he knew. It was not long, then, before the \"half-faced  camp\" was ready for his mother and sister to move into.    Then there was the water question. Dennis Hanks afterward said: \"Tom  Lincoln riddled his land like a honeycomb\" trying to find good water. In  the fall and winter they caught rainwater or melted snow and strained  it, but that was not very healthful at best. So Abe and Sarah had to go  a mile to a spring and carry all the water they needed to drink, and,  when there had been no rain for a long time, all the water they used for  cooking and washing had to be brought from there, too.    When warmer weather came, after their \"long and dreary winter\" of  shivering in that poor shed, the \"camp\" did not seem so bad. Thomas  Lincoln soon set about building a warmer and more substantial cabin. Abe  was now eight years old, and had had some practice in the use of the  ax, so he was able to help his father still more by cutting and hewing  larger logs for the new cabin. They got it ready for the family to move  into before cold weather set in again.    They had to make their own furniture also. The table and chairs were  made of \"puncheon,\" or slabs of wood, with holes bored under each corner  to stick the legs in. Their bedsteads were poles fitted into holes bored  in logs in the walls of the cabin, and the protruding ends supported by  poles or stakes driven into the ground, for Tom Lincoln had not yet laid  the puncheon floor of their cabin. Abe's bed was a pile of dry leaves  laid in one corner of the loft to which he climbed by means of a ladder  of pegs driven into the wall, instead of stairs.    Their surroundings were such as to delight the heart of a couple of  care-free children. The forest was filled with oaks, beeches, walnuts  and sugar-maple trees, growing close together and free from underbrush.  Now and then there was an open glade called a prairie or \"lick,\" where  the wild animals came to drink and disport themselves. Game was  plentiful--deer, bears, pheasants, wild turkeys, ducks and birds of all  kinds. This, with Tom Lincoln's passion for hunting, promised good  things for the family to eat, as well as bearskin rugs for the bare  earth floor, and deerskin curtains for the still open door and window.  There were fish in the streams and wild fruits and nuts of many kinds to  be found in the woods during the summer and fall. For a long time the  corn for the \"corndodgers\" which they baked in the ashes, had to be  ground by pounding, or in primitive hand-mills. Potatoes were about the  only vegetable raised in large quantities, and pioneer families often  made the whole meal of roasted potatoes. Once when his father had \"asked  the blessing\" over an ashy heap of this staple, Abe remarked that they  were \"mighty poor blessings!\"    But there were few complaints. They were all accustomed to that way of  living, and they enjoyed the free and easy life of the forest. Their  only reason for complaint was because they had been compelled to live in  an open shed all winter, and because there was no floor to cover the  damp ground in their new cabin--no oiled paper for their one window, and  no door swinging in the single doorway--yet the father was carpenter and  cabinet maker! There is no record that Nancy Lincoln, weak and ailing  though she was, demurred even at such needless privations.    About the only reference to this period of their life that has been  preserved for us was in an odd little sketch in which Mr. Lincoln wrote  of himself as \"he.\"    \"A few days before the completion of his eighth year, in the absence of  his father, a flock of wild turkeys approached the new log cabin, and  Abraham, with a rifle gun, standing inside, shot through a crack and  killed one of them. He has never since pulled a trigger on any larger  game.\"    Though shooting was the principal sport of the youth and their fathers  in Lincoln's younger days, Abe was too kind to inflict needless  suffering upon any of God's creatures. He had real religion in his  loving heart. Even as a boy he seemed to know that            \"He prayeth best who loveth best             All things both great and small;           For the dear God that loveth us,            He made and loveth all.\"          CHAPTER V    LOSING HIS MOTHER      In the fall of 1817, when the Lincoln family had moved from the shed  into the rough log cabin, Thomas and Betsy Sparrow came and occupied the  \"darned little half-faced camp,\" as Dennis Hanks called it. Betsy  Sparrow was the aunt "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#5)"],[1,"to local usage in this respect. There is always a very good  reason for local usage about snow vehicles. But a toboggan which had  been ordered from a native at Fort Yukon would be waiting for us, and  it seemed not worth while to go to the expense of buying another merely  for three days' journey.    The second mistake was in engaging a boy as guide instead of a man. He  was an attractive youth of about fourteen who had done good service at  the Circle City mission the previous winter, when our nurse-in-charge  was contending single-handed against an epidemic of diphtheria. He was a  pleasant boy, with some English, who wanted to go and professed  knowledge of the route. The greatest mistake of all was starting out  through that lonely waste with the thermometer at 52 deg. below zero. The  old-timers in Alaska have a saying that \"travelling at 50 deg. below is all  right as long as it's all right.\" If there be a good trail, if there be  convenient stopping-places, if nothing go wrong, one may travel without  special risk and with no extraordinary discomfort at 50 deg. below zero and  a good deal lower. I have since that time made a short day's run at 62 deg.  below, and once travelled for two or three hours on a stretch at 65 deg.  below. But there is always more or less chance in travelling at low  temperatures, because a very small thing may necessitate a stop, and a  stop may turn into a serious thing. At such temperatures one must keep  going. No amount of clothing that it is possible to wear on the trail  will keep one warm while standing still. For dogs and men alike,  constant brisk motion is necessary; for dogs as well as men--even though  dogs will sleep outdoors in such cold without harm--for they cannot take  as good care of themselves in the harness as they can when loose. A  trace that needs mending, a broken buckle, a snow-shoe string that must  be replaced, may chill one so that it is impossible to recover one's  warmth again. The bare hand cannot be exposed for many seconds without  beginning to freeze; it is dangerous to breathe the air into the lungs  for any length of time without a muffler over the mouth.    Our troubles began as soon as we started. The trail was a narrow,  winding toboggan track of sixteen or seventeen inches, while our sled  was twenty inches wide, so that one runner was always dragging in the  loose snow, and that meant slow, heavy going.    [Sidenote: SUNRISE AND SUNSET]    The days were nearing the shortest of the year, when, in these  latitudes, the sun does but show himself and withdraw again. But,  especially in very cold weather, which is nearly always very clear  weather, that brief appearance is preceded by a feast of rich, delicate  colour. First a greenish glow on the southern horizon, brightening into  lemon and then into clear primrose, invades the deep purple of the  starry heavens. Then a beautiful circle of blush pink above a circle of  pure amethyst gradually stretches all around the edge of the sky, slowly  brightening while the stars fade out and the heavens change to blue. The  dead white mirror of the snow takes every tint that the skies display  with a faint but exquisite radiance. Then the sun's disk appears with a  flood of yellow light but with no appreciable warmth, and for a little  space his level rays shoot out and gild the tree tops and the distant  hills. The snow springs to life. Dead white no longer, its dry,  crystalline particles glitter in myriads of diamond facets with every  colour of the prism. Then the sun is gone, and the lovely circle of rose  pink over amethyst again stretches round the horizon, slowly fading  until once more the pale primrose glows in the south against the purple  sky with its silver stars. Thus sunrise and sunset form a continuous  spectacle, with a purity of delicate yet splendid colour that only  perfectly dry atmosphere permits. The primrose glow, the heralding  circle, the ball of orange light, the valedictory circle, the primrose  glow again, and a day has come and gone. Air can hold no moisture at all  at these low temperatures, and the skies are cloudless.    [Sidenote: AN ESCAPADE ON THE YUKON]    Moreover, in the wilds at 50 deg. below zero there is the most complete  silence. All animal life is hidden away. Not a rabbit flits across the  trail; in the absolutely still air not a twig moves. A rare raven passes  overhead, and his cry, changed from a hoarse croak to a sweet liquid  note, reverberates like the musical glasses. There is no more delightful  sound in the wilderness than this occasional lapse into music of the  raven. We wound through the scrub spruce and willow and over the  niggerhead swamps, a faint tinkle of bells, a little cloud of steam; for  in the great cold the moisture of the animals' breath hangs over their  heads in the still air, and on looking back it stands awhile along the  course at dogs' height until it is presently deposited on twigs and  tussocks. We wound along, a faint tinkle of bells, a little cloud of  steam, and in the midst of the cloud a tousle of shaggy black-and-white  hair and red-and-white pompons--going out of the dead silence behind  into the dead silence before. The dusk came, and still we plodded and  pushed our weary way, swinging that heavy sled incessantly, by the gee  pole in front and the handle-bars behind, in the vain effort to keep it  on the trail. Two miles an hour was all that we were making. We had come  but thirteen or fourteen miles out of twenty-four, and it was dark; and  it grew colder.    The dogs whined and stopped every few yards, worn out by wallowing in  the snow and the labour of the collar. The long scarfs that wrapped our  mouths and noses had been shifted and shifted, as one part after another  became solid with ice from the breath, until over their whole length  they were stiff as boards. After two more miles of it it was evident  that we could not reach the mail cabin that night. Then I made my last  and worst mistake. We should have stopped and camped then and there. We  had tent and stove and everything requisite. But the native boy insisted  that the cabin was \"only little way,\" and any one who knows the misery  of making camp in extremely cold weather, in the dark, will understand  our reluctance to do so.    I decided to make a cache of the greater part of our load--tent and  stove and supplies generally--and to push on to the cabin with but the  bedding and the grub box, returning for the stuff in the morning. And,  since in the deepest depths of blundering there is a deeper still, by  some one's carelessness, but certainly by my fault, the axe was left  behind in the cache.    With our reduced burden we made better progress, and in a short time  reached the end of the portage and came out on the frozen river, just as  the moon, a day or two past the full, rose above the opposite bank. One  sees many strange distortions of sun and moon in this land, but never  was a stranger seen than this. Her disk, shining through the dense air  of the river bottom, was in shape an almost perfect octagon, regular as  though it had been laid off with dividers and a ruler.    We were soon in doubt about the trail. The mail-carrier had gone down  only two or three times this winter and each time had taken a different  route, as more and more of the river closed and gave him more and more  direct passage. A number of Indians had been hunting, and their tracks  added to the tangle of trails. Presently we entered a thick mist that  even to inexperienced eyes spoke of open water or new ice yet moist. So  heavy was the vapour that to the man at the handle-bars the man at the  gee pole loomed ghostly, and the man ahead of the dogs could not be  distinguished at all. We had gone so much farther than our native boy  had declared we had to go that we began to fear that in the confusion of  trails we had taken the wrong one and had passed the cabin. That is the  tenderfoot's, or, as we say, the chechaco's, fear; it is the one thing  that it may almost be said never happens. But the boy fell down  completely and was frankly at a loss. All we could get out of him was:  \"May-be-so we catch cabin bymeby, may-be-so no.\" If we had passed the  cabin it was twenty odd miles to the next; and it grew colder and the  dogs were utterly weary again, prone upon the trail at every small  excuse for a stop, only to be stirred by the whip, heavily wielded.  Surely never men thrust themselves foolhardily into worse predicament!  Then I made my last mistake. Dimly the bank loomed through the mist, and  I said: \"We can't go any farther; I think we've missed the trail and I'm  going across to yon bank to see if there's a place to camp.\" I had not  gone six steps from the trail when the ice gave way under my feet and I  found myself in water to my hips.    [Sidenote: AN ESCAPADE ON THE YUKON]    Under Providence I owe it to the mukluks I wore, tied tight round my  knees, that I did not lose my life, or at least my feet. The thermometer  at Circle City stood at 60 deg. below zero at dark that day, and down on the  ice it is always about 5 deg. colder than on the bank, because cold air is  heavy air and sinks to the lowest level, and 65 deg. below zero means 97 deg.  below freezing.    My moose-hide breeches froze solid the moment I scrambled out, but not a  drop of water got to my feet. If the water had reached my feet they  would have frozen almost as quickly as the moose hide in that fearful  cold. Thoroughly alarmed now, and realising our perilous situation, we  did the only thing there was to do--we turned the dogs loose and  abandoned the sled and went back along the trail we had followed as fast  as we could. We knew that we could safely retrace our steps and that the  trail would lead us to the bank after a while. We knew not where the  trail would lead us in the other direction. As a matter of fact, it led  to the mail cabin, two miles farther on, and"]]]
