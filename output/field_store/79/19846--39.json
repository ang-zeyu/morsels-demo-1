Three or four  persons ate from one platter and drank from the same big bowl of milk.  They had no forks, so they ate from their fingers and threw the bones  under the table among the pine branches. Sometimes they took knives from  their belts to cut the meat.    When the guests sat back satisfied, Harald called to the thralls:    \"Carry out the tables.\"    So they did and brought in two great tubs of mead and set one at each  end of the hall. Then the queen stood up and called some of her women.  They went to the mead tubs. They took the horns, when the thralls had  filled them, and carried them to the men with some merry word. Perhaps  one woman said as she handed a man his horn:    \"This horn has no feet to be set down upon. You must drink it at one  draught.\"    Perhaps another said:    \"Mead loves a merry face.\"    The women were beautiful, moving about the hall. The queen wore a  trailing dress of blue velvet with long flowing sleeves. She had a short  apron of striped Arabian silk with gold fringe along the bottom. From  her shoulders hung a long train of scarlet wool embroidered in gold.  White linen covered her head. Her long yellow hair was pulled around at  the sides and over her breast and was fastened under the belt of her  apron. As she walked, her train made a pleasant rustle among the pine  branches. She was tall and straight and strong. Some of her younger  women wore no linen on their heads and had their white arms bare, with  bracelets shining on them. They, too, were tall and strong.    All the time men were calling across the fire to one another asking news  or telling jokes and laughing.    An old man, Harald's uncle, sat in the high seat on the north side. That  was the place of honor. But the high seat on the south side was empty;  for that was the king's seat. Harald sat on the steps before it.    The feast went merrily until long after midnight. Then the thralls took  some of the guests to the guest house to sleep, and some to the beds  around the sides of the feast hall. But some men lay down on the benches  and drew their cloaks over themselves.    On the next night there was another feast. Still Harald sat on the step  before the high seat. But when the tables were gone and the horns were  going around, he stood up and raised high a horn of ale and said loudly:    \"This horn of memory I drink in honor of my father, Halfdan, son of  Gudrod, who sits now in Valhalla. And I vow that I will grind my  father's foes under my heel.\"    Then he drank the ale and sat down in the king's high seat, while all  the men stood up and raised their horns and shouted:    \"King Harald!\"    And some cried:    \"That was a brave vow.\"    [Illustration: \"_I vow that I will grind my father's foes under my  heel_\"]    And Harald's uncle called out:    \"A health to King Harald!\"    And they all drank it.    Then a man stood up and said:    \"Hear my song of King Halfdan!\" for this man was a skald.    \"Yes, the song!\" shouted the men, and Harald nodded his head.    So the skald took down his great harp from the wall behind him and went  and stood before Harald. The bottom of the harp rested on the floor, but  the top reached as high as the skald's shoulders. The brass frame shone  in the light. The strings were some of gold and some of silver. The man  struck them with his hand and sang of King Halfdan, of his battles, of  his strong arm and good sword, of his death, and of how men loved him.    When he had finished, King Harald took a bracelet from his arm and gave  it to him, saying:    \"Take this as thanks for your good song.\"    The guests stayed the next day and at night there was another feast.  When the mead horns were going around, King Harald stood up and spoke:    \"I said that no man should go away empty-handed from drinking my  father's funeral ale.\"    He beckoned the thralls, and they brought in a great treasure-chest and  set it down by the high seat. King Harald opened it and took out rich  gifts--capes and sword-belts and beautiful cloth and bracelets and gold  cloak-pins. These he sent about the hall and gave something to every  man. The guests wondered at the richness of his gifts.    \"This young king has an open hand,\" they said, \"and deep  treasure-chests.\"    After breakfast the next morning the guests went out and stood by their  horses ready to go, but before they mounted, thralls brought a horn of  mead to each man. That was called the stirrup-horn, because after they  drank it the men put their feet to the stirrups and sprang upon their  horses and started. King Harald and his people rode a little way with  them.    All men said that that was the richest funeral feast that ever was  held.      FOOTNOTES:    [6] See note about feast hall on page 196.    [7] See note about tables on page 196.          [Illustration]    Harald's Battle      Now King Halfdan had many foes. When he was alive they were afraid to  make war upon him, for he was a mighty warrior. But when Harald became  king, they said:    \"He is but a lad. We will fight with him and take his land.\"    So they began to make ready. King Harald heard of this and he laughed  and said:    \"Good! 'Foes'-fear' is thirsty, and my legs are stiff with much  sitting.\"    He called three men to him. To one he gave an arrow, saying:    \"Run and carry this arrow north. Give it into the hands of the master of  the next farm, and say that all men are to meet here within two weeks  from this day. They must come ready for war and mounted on horses. Say  also that if a man does not obey this call, or if he receives this arrow  and does not carry it on to his next neighbor, he shall be outlawed  from this country, and his land shall be taken from him.\"    He gave arrows to the other two men and told them to run south and east  with the same message.    So all through King Harald's country men were soon busy mending helmets  and polishing swords and making shields. There was blazing of forges and  clanging of anvils all through the land.    On the day set, the fields about King Harald's house were full of men  and horses. After breakfast a horn blew. Every man snatched his weapons  and jumped upon his horse. Men of the same neighborhood stood together,  and their chief led them. They waited for the starting horn. This did  not look like our army. There were no uniforms. Some men wore helmets,  some did not. Some wore coats of mail, but others wore only their  jackets and tights of bright-colored wool. But at each man's left side  hung a great shield. Over his right shoulder went his sword-belt and  held his long sword under his left hand. Above most men's heads shone  the points of their tall spears. Some men carried axes in their belts.  Some carried bows and arrows. Many had ram's horns hanging from their  necks.    King Harald rode at the front of his army with his standard-bearer  beside him. Chain-armor covered the king's body. A red cloak was thrown  over his shoulders. On his head was a gold helmet with a dragon standing  up from it. He carried a round shield on his left arm. The king had made  that shield himself. It was of brass. The rivets were of silver, with  strangely shaped heads. On the back of Harald's horse was a red cloth  trimmed with the fur of ermine.    King Harald looked up at his standard and laughed aloud.    \"Oh, War-lover,\" he cried, \"you and I ride out on a gay journey.\"    A horn blew again and the army started. The men shouted as they went,  and blew their ram's horns.    \"Now we shall taste something better than even King Harald's ale,\"  shouted one.    Another rose in his stirrups and sniffed the air.    \"Ah! I smell a battle,\" he cried. \"It is sweeter than those strange  waters of Arabia.\"    So the army went merrily through the land. They carried no tents, they  had no provision wagons.    \"The sky is a good enough tent for a soldier,\" said the Norsemen. \"Why  carry provisions when they lie in the farms beside you?\"    After two days King Harald saw another army on the hills.    \"Thorstein,\" he shouted, \"up with the white shield and go tell King Haki  to choose his battle-field. We will wait but an hour. I am eager for the  frolic.\"    So Thorstein raised a white shield on his spear as a sign that he came  on an errand of peace. He rode near King Haki, but he could not wait  until he came close before he shouted out his message and then turned  and rode back.    \"Tell your boy king that we will not hang back,\" Haki called after  Thorstein.    King Harald's men waited on the hillside and watched the other army  across the valley. They saw King Haki point and saw twenty men ride off  as he pointed. They stopped in a patch of hazel and hewed with their  axes.    \"They are getting the hazels,\" said Thorstein.    \"Audun,\" said King Harald to a man near him, \"stay close to my standard  all day. You must see the best of the fight. I want to hear a song about  it after it is over.\"    This Audun was the skald who sang at the drinking of King Halfdan's  funeral ale.    King Haki's men rode down into the valley. They drove down stakes all  about a great field. They tied the hazel twigs to the stakes in a  string. But they left an open space toward King Harald's army and one  toward King Haki's. Then a man raised a white shield and galloped toward  King Harald.    \"We are ready!\" he shouted.    At the same time King Haki raised a red shield. King Harald's men put  their shields before their mouths and shouted into them. It made a great  roaring war-cry.    \"Up with the war shield!\" shouted King Harald. \"Horns blow!\"    There was a blowing of horns on both sides. The two armies galloped down  into the field and ran together. The fight had begun.    All that day long swords were flashing, spears flying, men shouting, men  falling from their horses, swords clashing against shields.    \"Victory flashes from that dragon,\" Harald's men said, pointing to the  king's"]]]
