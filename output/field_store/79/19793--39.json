[Illustration]    [Illustration]    'You're a poltroon,' shouted Bill. 'You're a slaverin', quaverin',  melon-carryin' nincompoop. There's no more chance of getting information  out of you than out of a terrified Turnip.'    Leaving the Bandicoot to pursue his quavering, melon-humping existence,  they set off again, Bill giving way to some very despondent expressions.    'As far as I can see,' he said, 'if we can't find somethin' better than  stone-deaf hedgehogs, peevish parrots, and funkin' bandicoots we may as  well give way to despair.'    Bunyip Bluegum was forced to exert his finest oratory to inspire them to  another frame of mind. 'Let it never be said,' he exclaimed, 'that the  unconquerable hearts of Puddin'-owners quailed before a parrot, a  hedgehog, or a bandicoot.'      'Let hedgehogs deaf go delve and dig,      Immune from loudest howl,    Let bandicoots lump melons big,      Let peevish parrots prowl.      'Shall puddin'-owners bow the head      At such affronts as these?    No, No! March on, by anger led,      Our Puddin' to release.      'Let courage high resolve inflame      Our captive Pud to free;    Our banner wave, our words proclaim      We march to victory!'    'Bravely sung,' exclaimed Bill, grasping Bunyip Bluegum by the hand, and  they proceeded with expressions of the greatest courage and  determination.    As a reward for this renewed activity, they got some useful information  from a Rooster who was standing at his front gate looking up and down  the road, and wishing to heaven that somebody would come along for him  to talk to. They got, in fact, a good deal more information than they  asked for, for the Rooster was one of those fine up-standing, bumptious  skites who love to talk all day, in the heartiest manner, to total  strangers while their wives do the washing.    [Illustration]    'Singed possum,' he exclaimed, when they had put the usual question to  him. 'Now, what an extraordinary thing that you should come along and  ask me that question. What an astounding and incredible thing that you  should actually use the word \"singed\" in connexion with the word  \"possum\". Though mind you, the word I had in my mind was not \"singed\",  but \"burning\". And not \"possum\", but \"feathers\". Now, I'll tell you why.  Only this morning, as I was standing here, I said to myself \"somebody's  been burning feathers\". I called out at once to the wife--fine woman,  the wife, you'll meet her presently--\"Have you been burning feathers?\"  \"No\", says she. \"Well,\" said I, \"if you haven't been burning feathers,  somebody else has.\" At the very moment that I'm repeating the words  \"feathers\" and \"burning\" you come along and repeat the words \"singed\"  and \"possum\". Instantly I call to mind that at the identical moment that  I smelt something burning, I saw a possum passing this very gate, though  whether he happened to be singed or not I didn't inquire.'    'Which way did he go?' inquired Bill excitedly.    'Now, let me see,' said the Rooster. 'He went down the road, turned to  the right, gave a jump and a howl, and set off in the direction of  Watkin Wombat's summer residence.'    'The very man we're after,' shouted Bill, and bolted off down the road,  followed by the others, without taking any notice of the Rooster's  request to wait a minute and be introduced to the wife.    'His wife may be all right,' said Bill as they ran, 'but what I say is,  blow meetin' a bloomin' old Rooster's wife when you haven't got a year  to waste listenin' to a bloomin' old Rooster.'    They followed the Rooster's directions with the utmost rapidity, and  came to a large hollow tree with a door in the side and a notice-board  nailed up which said, 'Watkin Wombat, Esq., Summer Residence'.    The door was locked, but it was clear that the puddin'-thieves were  inside, because they heard the Possum say peevishly, 'You're eating too  much, and here's me, most severely singed, not getting sufficient', and  the Wombat was heard to say, 'What you want is soap', but the Possum  said angrily, 'What I need is immense quantities of puddin'.'    The avengers drew aside to hold a consultation.    'What's to be done?' said Bill. 'It's no use knockin', because they'd  look through the keyhole and refuse to come out, and, not bein'  burglars, we can't bust the door in. It seems to me that there's nothin'  for it but to give way to despair.'    [Illustration]    'Never give way to despair while whiskers can be made from dry grass,'  said Bunyip Bluegum, and suiting the action to the word, he swiftly made  a pair of fine moustaches out of dried grass and stuck them on with  wattle gum. 'Now, lend me your hat,' he said to Bill, and taking the hat  he turned up the brim, dented in the top, and put it on. 'The bag is  also required,' he said to Sam, and taking that in his hand and turning  his coat inside out, he stood before them completely disguised.    'You two,' he said, 'must remain in hiding behind the tree. You will  hear me knock, accost the ruffians and hold them in conversation. The  moment you hear me exclaim loudly, \"Hey, Presto! Pots and Pans\", you  will dart out and engage the villains at fisticuffs. The rest leave to  me.'    [Illustration]    Waiting till the others were hidden behind the tree, Bunyip rapped  smartly on the door which opened presently and the Wombat put his head  out cautiously.    'Have I the extreme pleasure of addressing Watkin Wombat, Esq.?'  inquired Bunyip Bluegum, with a bow.    Of course, seeing a perfect stranger at the door, the Wombat had no  suspicions, and said at once, 'Such is the name of him you see before  you.'    'I have called to see you,' said Bunyip, 'on a matter of business. The  commodity which I vend is Pootles's Patent Pudding Enlarger, samples of  which I have in the bag. As a guarantee of good faith we are giving  samples of our famous Enlarger away to all well-known Puddin'-owners.  The Enlarger, one of the wonders of modern science, has but to be poured  over the puddin', with certain necessary incantations, and the puddin'  will be instantly enlarged to double its normal size.' He took some  sugar from the bag and held it up. 'I am now about to hand you some of  this wonderful discovery. But,' he added impressively, 'the operation of  enlarging the puddin' is a delicate one, and must be performed in the  open air. Produce your puddin', and I will at once apply Pootles's  Patent with marvellous effect.'    'Of course it's understood that no charge is to be made,' said the  Possum, hurrying out.    'No charge whatever,' said Bunyip Bluegum.    So on the principle of always getting something for nothing, as the  Wombat said, Puddin' was brought out and placed on the ground.    'Now watch me closely,' said Bunyip Bluegum. He sprinkled the Puddin'  with sugar, made several passes with his hands, and pronounced these  words--    [Illustration]      'Who incantations utters    He generally mutters      His gruesome blasts and bans    But I, you need not doubt it,    Prefer aloud to shout it,      Hey, Presto! Pots and Pans.'    Out sprang Bill and Sam and set about the puddin'-thieves like a pair of  windmills, giving them such a clip-clap clouting and a flip-flap  flouting, that what with being punched and pounded, and clipped and  clapped, they had only enough breath left to give two shrieks of despair  while scrambling back into Watkin Wombat's Summer Residence, and banging  the door behind them. The three friends had Puddin' secured in no time,  and shook hands all round, congratulating Bunyip Bluegum on the success  of his plan.    'Your noble actin',' said Bill, 'has saved our Puddin's life.'    'Them puddin'-thieves,' said Sam, 'was children in your hands.'    'We hear you,' sang out the Possum, and the Wombat added, 'Oh, what  deceit!'    'Enough of you two,' shouted Bill. 'If we catch you sneakin' after our  Puddin' again, you'll get such a beltin' that you'll wish you was  vegetarians. And now,' said he, 'for a glorious reunion round the camp  fire.'    And a glorious reunion they had, tucking into hot steak-and-kidney  puddin' and boiled jam roll, which, after the exertions of the day, went  down, as Bill said, 'Grand'.    'If them puddin'-thieves ain't sufferin' the agonies of despair at this  very moment, I'll eat my hat along with the Puddin',' said Bill,  exultantly.    'Indeed,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'the consciousness that our enemies are  deservedly the victims of acute mental and physical anguish, imparts, it  must be admitted, an additional flavour to the admirable Puddin'.'    'Well spoken,' said Bill, admiringly. 'Which I will say, that for  turning off a few well-chosen words no parson in the land is the equal  of yourself.'    'Your health!' said Bunyip Bluegum.    The singing that evening was particularly loud and prolonged, owing to  the satisfaction they all felt at the recovery of their beloved Puddin'.  The Puddin', who had got the sulks over Sam's remarks that fifteen goes  of steak-and-kidney were enough for any self-respecting man, protested  against the singing, which, he said, disturbed his gravy. '\"More eating  and less noise\" is my motto,' he said, and he called Bill a  leather-headed old barrel organ for reproving him.    'Albert is a spoilt child, I fear,' said Bill, shoving him into the bag  to keep him quiet, and without more ado, led off with--    [Illustration]      'Ho! aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_,      Rollin' home around the Horn,    The Bo'sun pulls the Captain's nose      For treatin' him with scorn.      'Rollin' home, rollin' home,    Rollin' home across the foam.    The Bo'sun goes with thumps and blows    The whole way rollin' home.'    'But,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum, after about fifteen verses of the  _Salt Junk Sarah_, 'the superior skill, ingenuity and darin' with which  you bested them puddin'-snatchers reminds me of a similar"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#5)"],[1,"also show cleavage planes of two or more systems, and others show  a crystalline structure comprised of several systems. Thus calcspar is  in the 2nd, or hexagonal, whilst aragonite is in the 4th, the rhombic,  system, yet both are the same substance, viz.:--carbonate of lime. Such  a condition is called dimorphism; those minerals which crystallise in  three systems are said to be trimorphous. Those in a number of systems  are polymorphous, and of these sulphur may be taken as an example, since  it possesses thirty or more modifications of its crystalline structure,  though some authorities eliminate nearly all these, and, since it is  most frequently in either the 4th (rhombic) or the 5th (monoclinic)  systems, consider it as an example of dimorphism, rather than  polymorphism.    These varieties of cleavage affect the character, beauty and usefulness  of the stone to a remarkable extent, and at the same time form a means  of ready and certain identification and classification.          CHAPTER V.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      C--LIGHT.    Probably the most important of the many important physical properties  possessed by precious stones are those of light and its effects, for to  these all known gems owe their beauty, if not actual fascination.    When light strikes a cut or polished stone, one or more of the following  effects are observed:--it may be transmitted through the stone,  diaphaneity, as it is called; it may produce single or double  refraction, or polarisation; if reflected, it may produce lustre or  colour; or it may produce phosphorescence; so that light may be (1)  transmitted; (2) reflected; or produce (3) phosphorescence.    (1) TRANSMISSION.--In transmitted light we have, as stated above, single  or double refraction, polarisation, and diaphaneity.    To the quality of _refraction_ is due one of the chief charms of certain  precious stones. It is not necessary to explain here what refraction is,  for everyone will be familiar with the refractive property of a  light-beam when passing through a medium denser than atmospheric air. It  will be quite sufficient to say that all the rays are not equal in  refractive power in all substances, so that the middle of the spectrum  is generally selected as the mean for indexing purposes.    It will be seen that the stones in the 1st, or cubic system, show single  refraction, whereas those of all other systems show double refraction;  thus, light, in passing through their substance, is deviated, part of it  going one way, the other portion going in another direction--that is, at  a slightly different angle--so that this property alone will isolate  readily all gems belonging to the 1st system.    A well-known simple experiment in physics shows this clearly. A mark on  a card or paper is viewed through a piece of double-refracting spar  (Iceland spar or clear calcite), when the mark is doubled and two  appear. On rotating this rhomb of spar, one of these marks is seen to  revolve round the other, which remains stationary, the moving mark  passing further from the centre in places. When the spar is cut and used  in a certain direction, we see but one mark, and such a position is  called its optical axis.    _Polarisation_ is when certain crystals possessing double refraction  have the power of changing light, giving it the appearance of poles  which have different properties, and the polariscope is an instrument in  which are placed pieces of double-refracting (Iceland) spar, so that all  light passing through will be polarised.    Since only crystals possessing the property of double refraction show  polarisation, it follows that those of the 1st, or cubic system--in  which the diamond stands a prominent example--fail to become polarised,  so that when such a stone is placed in the polariscope and rotated, it  fails _at every point_ to transmit light, which a double-refracting gem  allows to pass except when its optical axis is placed in the axis of the  polariscope, but this will be dealt with more fully when the methods of  testing the stones come to be considered.    _Diaphaneity_, or the power of transmitting light:--some rather fine  trade distinctions are drawn between the stones in this class, technical  distinctions made specially for purposes of classification, thus:--a  \"non-diaphanous\" stone is one which is quite opaque, no light of any  kind passing through its substance; a \"diaphanous\" stone is one which is  altogether transparent; \"semi-diaphanous\" means one not altogether  transparent, and sometimes called \"sub-transparent.\" A \"translucent\"  stone is one in which, though light passes through its substance, sight  is not possible through it; whilst in a \"sub-translucent\" stone, light  passes through it, but only in a small degree.    The second physical property of light is seen in those stones which owe  their beauty or value to REFLECTION: this again may be dependent on  Lustre, or Colour.    ~Lustre.~--This is an important characteristic due to reflection, and of  which there are six varieties:--([alpha]) adamantine (which some  authorities, experts and merchants subdivide as detailed below);  ([beta]) pearly; ([gamma]) silky; ([delta]) resinous; ([epsilon])  vitreous; ([zeta]) metallic. These may be described:--    ([alpha]) Adamantine, or the peculiar lustre of the diamond, so called  from the lustre of adamantine spar, which is a form of corundum (as is  emery) with a diamond-like lustre, the hard powder of which is used in  polishing diamonds. It is almost pure anhydrous alumina (Al_{2}O_{3})  and is, roughly, four times as heavy as water. The lustre of this is the  true \"adamantine,\" or diamond, brilliancy, and the other and impure  divisions of this particular lustre are: _splendent_, when objects are  reflected perfectly, but of a lower scale of perfection than the true  \"adamantine\" standard, which is absolutely flawless. When still lower,  and the reflection, though maybe fairly good, is somewhat \"fuzzy,\" or is  confused or out of focus, it is then merely _shining_; when still less  distinct, and no trace of actual reflection is possible (by which is  meant that no object can be reproduced in any way to define it, as it  could be defined in the reflection from still water or the surface of a  mirror, even though imperfectly) the stone is then said to _glint_ or  _glisten_. When too low in the scale even to glisten, merely showing a  feeble lustre now and again as the light is reflected from its surface  in points which vary with the angle of light, the stone is then said to  be _glimmering_. Below this, the definitions of lustre do not go, as  such stones are said to be _lustreless_.    ([beta]) Pearly, as its name implies, is the lustre of a pearl.    ([gamma]) Silky, possessing the sheen of silk, hence its name.    ([delta]) Resinous, also explanatory in its name; amber and the like  come in this variety.    ([epsilon]) Vitreous. This also explains itself, being of the lustre of  glass, quartz, etc.; some experts subdividing this for greater defining  accuracy into the \"sub-vitreous\" or lower type, for all but perfect  specimens.    ([zeta]) Metallic or Sub-metallic. The former when the lustre is perfect  as in gold; the latter when the stones possess the less true lustre of  copper.    ~Colour.~--Colour is an effect entirely dependent upon light, for in the  total absence of light, such as in black darkness, objects are  altogether invisible to the normal human eye. In daylight, also, certain  objects reflect so few vibrations of light, or none, that they appear  grey, black, or jet-black; whilst those which reflect all the rays of  which light is composed, and in the same number of vibrations, appear  white. Between these two extremes of _none_ and _all_ we find a  wonderful play and variety of colour, as some gems allow the red rays  only to pass and therefore appear red; others allow the blue rays only  and these appear blue, and so on, through all the shades, combinations  and varieties of the colours of which light is composed, as revealed by  the prism. But this is so important a matter that it demands a chapter  to itself.    The third physical property of light, PHOSPHORESCENCE, is the property  possessed by certain gems and minerals of becoming phosphorescent on  being rubbed, or on having their temperature raised by this or other  means.    It is difficult to say exactly whether this is due to the heat, the  friction, or to electricity. Perhaps two or all of these may be the  cause, for electricity is developed in some gems--such as the topaz--by  heat, and heat by electricity, and phosphorescence developed by both.    For example, if we rub together some pulverised fluorspar in the dark,  or raise its temperature by the direct application of heat, such as from  a hot or warm iron, or a heated wire, we at once obtain excellent  phosphorescence. Common quartz, rubbed against a second piece of the  same quartz in the dark, becomes highly phosphorescent. Certain gems,  also, when merely exposed to light--sunlight for preference--then taken  into a darkened room, will glow for a short time. The diamond is one of  the best examples of this kind of phosphorescence, for if exposed to  sunlight for a while, then covered and rapidly taken into black  darkness, it will emit a curious phosphorescent glow for from one to ten  seconds; the purer the stone, the longer, clearer and brighter the  result.          CHAPTER VI.    PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.      D--COLOUR.    Colour is one of the most wonderful effects in nature. It is an  attribute of light and is not a part of the object which appears to be  coloured; though all objects, by their chemical or physical composition,  determine the number and variety of vibrations passed on or returned to  the eye, thus fixing their own individual colours.    We have also seen that if an _equal_ light-beam becomes obstructed in  its passage by some substance which is denser than"]]]
