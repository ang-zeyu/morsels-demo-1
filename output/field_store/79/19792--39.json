WOMAN, ABOVE ALL OTHER EDUCATORS, educates humanly. Man is the brain,  but woman is the heart of humanity; he its judgment, she its feeling; he  its strength, she its grace, ornament, and solace. Even the understanding  of the best woman seems to work mainly through her affections. And thus,  though man may direct the intellect, woman cultivates the feelings, which  mainly determine the character. While he fills the memory, she occupies the  heart. She makes us love what he can make us only believe, and it is  chiefly through her that we are enabled to arrive at virtue.    9. THE POOREST DWELLING, presided over by a virtuous, thrifty, cheerful,  and cleanly woman, may thus be the abode of comfort, virtue, and happiness;  it may be the scene of every ennobling relation in family life; it may be  endeared to man by many delightful associations; furnishing a sanctuary for  the heart, a refuge from the storms of life, a sweet resting-place after  labor, a consolation in misfortune, a pride in prosperity, and a joy at all  times.    10. THE GOOD HOME IS THUS THE BEST OF SCHOOLS, not only in youth but in  age. There young and old best learn cheerfulness, patience, self-control,  and the spirit of service and of duty. The home is the true school of  courtesy, of which woman is always the best practical instructor. \"Without  woman,\" says the Provencal proverb, \"men were but ill-licked cubs.\"  Philanthropy radiates from the home as from a centre. \"To love the little  platoon we belong to in society,\" said Burke, \"is the germ of all public  affections.\" The wisest and best have not been ashamed to own it to be  their greatest joy and happiness to sit \"behind the heads of children\" in  the inviolable circle of home.    [Illustration]    {26}    To Young Women.    [Illustration: MEDITATION.]    1. TO BE A WOMAN, in the truest and highest sense of the word, is to be the  best thing beneath the skies. To be a woman is something more than to live  eighteen or twenty years; something more than to grow to the physical  stature of women; something more than to wear flounces, exhibit dry goods,  sport jewelry, catch the gaze of lewd-eyed men; {27} something more than to  be a belle, a wife, or a mother. Put all these qualifications together and  they do but little toward making a true woman.    2. BEAUTY AND STYLE are not the surest passports to womanhood--some of the  noblest specimens of womanhood that the world has ever seen have presented  the plainest and most unprepossessing appearance. A woman's worth is to be  estimated by the real goodness of her heart, the greatness of her soul, and  the purity and sweetness of her character; and a woman with a kindly  disposition and well-balanced temper is both lovely and attractive, be her  face ever so plain, and her figure ever so homely; she makes the best of  wives and the truest of mothers.    3. BEAUTY IS A DANGEROUS GIFT.--It is even so. Like wealth, it has ruined  its thousands. Thousands of the most beautiful women are destitute of  common sense and common humanity. No gift from heaven is so general and so  widely abused by woman as the gift of beauty. In about nine cases in ten it  makes her silly, senseless, thoughtless, giddy, vain, proud, frivolous,  selfish, low and mean. I think I have seen more girls spoiled by beauty  than by any other one thing. \"She is beautiful, and she knows it,\" is as  much as to say that she is spoiled. A beautiful girl is very likely to  believe she was made to be looked at; and so she sets herself up for a show  at every window, in every door, on every corner of the street, in every  company at which opportunity offers for an exhibition of herself.    4. BEWARE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.--These facts have long since taught sensible  men to beware of beautiful women--to sound them carefully before they give  them their confidence. Beauty is shallow--only skin deep; fleeting--only  for a few years' reign; dangerous--tempting to vanity and lightness of  mind; deceitful--dazzling often to bewilder; weak--reigning only to ruin;  gross--leading often to sensual pleasure. And yet we say it need not be so.  Beauty is lovely and ought to be innocently possessed. It has charms which  ought to be used for good purposes. It is a delightful gift, which ought to  be received with gratitude and worn with grace and meekness. It should  always minister to inward beauty. Every woman of beautiful form and  features should cultivate a beautiful mind and heart.    5. RIVAL THE BOYS.--We want the girls to rival the boys in all that is  good, and refined, and ennobling. We want them to rival the boys, as they  well can, in learning, in understanding, in virtues; in all noble qualities  of mind and heart, but not in any of those things that have caused them,  justly or unjustly, to be described as savages. We want {28} the girls to  be gentle--not weak, but gentle, and kind and affectionate. We want to be  sure, that wherever a girl is, there should be a sweet, subduing and  harmonizing influence of purity, and truth, and love, pervading and  hallowing, from center to circumference, the entire circle in which she  moves. If the boys are savages, we want her to be their civilizer. We want  her to tame them, to subdue their ferocity, to soften their manners, and to  teach them all needful lessons of order, sobriety, and meekness, and  patience, and goodness.    6. KINDNESS.--Kindness is the ornament of man--it is the chief glory of  woman--it is, indeed, woman's true prerogative--her sceptre and her crown.  It is the sword with which she conquers, and the charm with which she  captivates.    7. ADMIRED AND BELOVED.--Young lady, would you be admired and beloved?  Would you be an ornament to your sex, and a blessing to your race?  Cultivate this heavenly virtue. Wealth may surround you with its  blandishments, and beauty, and learning, or talents, may give you admirers,  but love and kindness alone can captivate the heart. Whether you live in a  cottage or a palace, these graces can surround you with perpetual sunshine,  making you, and all around you, happy.    8. INWARD GRACE.--Seek ye then, fair daughters, the possession of that  inward grace, whose essence shall permeate and vitalize the affections,  adorn the countenance, make mellifluous the voice, and impart a hallowed  beauty even to your motions. Not merely that you may be loved, would I urge  this, but that you may, in truth, be lovely--that loveliness which fades  not with time, nor is marred or alienated by disease, but which neither  chance nor change can in any way despoil.    9. SILKEN ENTICEMENTS OF THE STRANGER.--We urge you, gentle maiden, to  beware of the silken enticements of the stranger, until your love is  confirmed by protracted acquaintance. Shun the idler, though his coffers  overflow with pelf. Avoid the irreverent--the scoffer of hallowed things;  and him who \"looks upon the wine while it is red;\" him too, \"who hath a  high look and a proud heart,\" and who \"privily slandereth his neighbor.\" Do  not heed the specious prattle about \"first love,\" and so place,  irrevocably, the seal upon your future destiny, before you have sounded, in  silence and secrecy, the deep fountains of your own heart. Wait, rather,  until your own character and that of him who would woo you, is more fully  developed. Surely, if this \"first love\" cannot endure a short probation,  fortified by \"the {29} pleasures of hope,\" how can it be expected to  survive years of intimacy, scenes of trial, distracting cares, wasting  sickness, and all the homely routine of practical life? Yet it is these  that constitute life, and the love that cannot abide them is false and must  die.           *       *       *       *       *      {30}    Influence of Female Character.    [Illustration: ROMAN LADIES.]    1. MORAL EFFECT.--It is in its moral effect on the mind and the heart of  man, that the influence of woman is most powerful and important. In the  diversity of tastes, habits, inclinations, and pursuits of the two sexes,  is found a most beneficent provision for controlling the force and  extravagance of human passion. The objects which most strongly seize and  stimulate the mind of man, rarely act at the same time and with equal power  on the mind of woman. She is naturally better, purer, and more chaste in  thought and language.    2. FEMALE CHARACTER.--But the influence of female character on the virtue  of men, is not seen merely in restraining and softening the violence of  human passion. To her is mainly committed the task of pouring into the  opening mind of infancy its first impressions of duty, and of stamping on  its susceptible heart the first image of its God. Who will not confess the  influence of a mother in forming the heart of a child? What man is there  who can not trace the origin of many of the best maxims of his life to the  lips of her who gave him birth? How wide, how lasting, how sacred is that  part of a woman's influence.    3. VIRTUE OF A COMMUNITY.--There is yet another mode, by which woman may  exert a powerful influence on the virtue of a community. It rests with her  in a pre-eminent degree, to give tone and elevation to the moral character  of the age, by deciding the degree of virtue that shall be necessary to  afford a passport to her society. If all the favor of woman were given only  to the good, if it were known that the charms and attractions of beauty,  and wisdom, and wit, were reserved only for the pure; if, in one word,  something of a similar rigor were exerted to exclude the profligate and  abandoned of society, as is shown to those who have fallen from  virtue,--how much would be done to re-enforce the motives to moral purity  among us, and impress on the minds of all a reverence for the sanctity and  obligations of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23624"],[0,"Ride Proud, Rebel!

Them boys pushin' the prisoners back there sure has it tough. Bet  some of 'em been eatin' dust most all day--\"    \"Be glad you're not ridin' in one of the wagons nursin' a hole in your  middle.\" Drew wet his handkerchief, or the sad gray rag which served  that purpose, and carefully washed out Shawnee's nostrils, rubbing the  horse gently down the nose and around his pricked ears.    Croxton spat and a splotch of brown tobacco juice pocked the roadside  gravel. \"Now ain't you cheerful!\" he observed. \"No, I've no hole in my  middle, or my top, or my bottom--and I don't want none, neither. All I  want is about an hour's sleep without Quirk or Drake breathin' down my  back wantin' to know why I'm playin' wagon dog. The which I ain't gonna  have very soon by the looks of it. So....\" He mounted, spat again with  accuracy enough to stun a grasshopper off a nodding weed top, which feat  seemed to restore a measure of his usual good nature. \"Got him! You  comin', Rennie?\"    The hours of Friday afternoon, evening, night, crawled by--leadenly, as  far as the men in the straggling column were concerned. That dash which  had carried them through from the Virginia border, through the old-time  whirling attack on Mount Sterling only days earlier, and which had  brought them into and beyond Lexington, was seeping from tired men who  slept in the saddle or fell out, too drugged with fatigue to know that  they slumped down along country fences, unconscious gifts for the enemy  doggedly drawing in from three sides. There was the core of veterans who  had seen this before, been a part of such punishing riding in Illinois,  Ohio, and Kentucky. The signs could be read, and as Drew spurred along  that faltering line of march late that night, carrying a message, he  felt a creeping chill which was not born of the night wind nor a warning  of swamp fever.    Before daylight there was another halt. He had to let Shawnee pick his  own careful path around and through groups of dismounted men sleeping  with their weapons still belted on, their mounts, heads drooping,  standing sentinel.    Saturday's dawn, and the advance had plowed ahead to the forks of the  road some three miles out of Cynthiana. One brigade moved directly  toward the town; the second--with a detachment of scouts--headed down  the right-hand road to cross the Licking River and move in upon the  enemies' rear. From the hill they could sight a stone-fence barricade  glistening with the metal of waiting musket barrels. Then, suddenly, the  old miracle came. Men who had clung through the hours to their saddles  by sheer will power alone, tightened their lines and were alertly alive.    The ear-stinging, throat-scratching Yell screeched high over the pound  of the artillery, the vicious spat of Minie balls. A whip length of  dusty gray-brown lashed forward, flanking the stone barrier. Blue-coated  men wavered, broke, ran for the bridge, heading into the streets of the  town. The gray lash curled around a handful of laggards and swept them  into captivity.    Then the brigade thundered on, driving the enemy back before they could  reform, until the Yankees holed up in the courthouse, the depot, a  handful of houses. Before eight o'clock it was all over, and the  confidence of the weary raiders was back. They had showed 'em!    Drew had the usual mixture of sharp scenes to remember as his small  portion of the engagement while he spurred Shawnee on past the blaze  which was spreading through the center of the town, licking out for more  buildings no one seemed to have the organization nor the will to save.  He was riding with the advance of Giltner's brigade, double-quicking it  downriver to Keller's Bridge. In town the Yankees were prisoners, but  here a long line, with heavy reserves in wedges of blue behind, strung  out across open fields.    Once more the Yell arose in sharp ululating wails, and the ragged line  swept from the road, tightening into a semblance of the saber blades  Morgan's men disdained to use ... clashed.... Then, after what seemed  like only a moment's jarring pause, it was on the move once more while  before it crumpled motes of blue were carried down the slope to the  riverbank, there to steady and stand fast.    Drew's throat was aching and dry, but he was still croaking hoarsely,  hardly feeling the slam of his Colts' recoils. They were up to that blue  line, firing at deadly point-blank range. And part of him wondered how  any men could still keep their feet and face back to such an assault  with ready muskets. By his side a man skipped as might a marcher trying  to catch step, then folded up, sliding limply to the trampled grass.    Men were flinging up hands holding empty cartridge boxes along the  attacking line--too many of them. Others reversed the empty carbines, to  use them in clubbing duels back and forth. The Union troops fell back,  firing still, making their way into the railroad cut. Now the river was  a part defense for them. Bayonets caught the sunlight in angry flashing,  and they bristled.    \"You ... Rennie....\"    Drew lurched back under the clutch of a frantic hand belonging to an  officer he knew.    \"Get back to the horse lines! Bring up the holders' ammunition, on the  double!\"    Drew ran, panting, his boots slipping and scraping on the grass as he  dodged around prone men who still moved, or others who lay only too  still. A horse reared, snorted, and was pulled down to four feet again.    \"Ammunition!\" Drew got the word out as a squawk, grabbing at the boxes  the waiting men were already tossing to him. Then, through the haze  which had been riding his mind since the battle began, he caught a clear  sight of the fifth man there.... And there was no disguising the blond  hair of the boy so eagerly watching the struggle below. Drew had found  Boyd--at a time he could do nothing about it. With his arms full, the  scout turned to race down the slope again, only to sight the white flag  waving from the railroad cut.    More prisoners to be marched along, joining the other dispirited ranks.  Drew heard one worried comment from an officer: they would soon have  more prisoners than guards.    He went back, trying to locate Boyd, but to no purpose. And the rest of  the day was more confusion, heat, never-ending weariness, and always the  sense of there being so little time. Rumors raced along the lines, five  thousand, ten thousand blue bellies on the march, drawing in from every  garrison in the blue grass. And those who had been hunted along the Ohio  roads a year before were haunted by that old memory of disaster.    Once more they made their way through the streets of Cynthiana, where  the acrid smoke of burning caught at throats, adding to the torturous  thirst which dried a man's mouth when he tore cartridge paper with his  teeth. Drew and Croxton took sketchy orders from Captain Quirk, their  eyes red-rimmed with fatigue above their powder-blackened lips and  chins. Fan out, be eyes and ears for the column moving into the Paris  pike.    Croxton's grin had no humor in it as they turned aside into a field to  make better time away from the cluttered highway.    \"Looks like the butter's spread a mite thin on the bread this time,\" he  commented. \"But the General's sure playin' it like he has all the aces  in hand. Which way to sniff out a Yankee?\"    \"I'd say any point of the compass now----\"    \"Listen!\" Sam's hand went up. \"Those ain't any guns of ours.\"    The rumble was distant, but Drew believed Croxton was right. Through the  dark, guns were moving up. The wasps were closing in on the disturbers  of their nest, and every one of them carried a healthy stinger. He  thought of what he had seen today: too many empty cartridge boxes,  Enfield rifles still carried by men who would not, in spite of orders,  discard them for the Yankee guns with ammunition to spare. Empty guns,  worn-out men, weary horses ... and Yankee guns moving confidently up  through the night.          3    _On the Run----_      \"They're comin'! Looks like the whole country's sproutin' Yankees outta  the ground.\"    They were, a dull dark mass at first and then an arc of one ominous  color advancing in a fast, purposeful drive, already overrunning the  pickets with only a lone shot here and there in defiance. They rode up  confidently, dismounted, and charged--to be thrown back once. But there  were too many of them, and they moved with the precision of men who knew  what was to be done and that they could do it. Confederates were trapped  before they could reach their horses; there was a wild whirling scramble  of a fight flowing backward toward the river.    Men with empty guns turned those guns into clubs, fighting to hold the  center. But the enemy had already cut them off from the Augusta road and  the bridge, and the river was at their backs. Water boiled under a lead  rain. Drew saw an opening between two Union troopers. Flattening himself  as best he could on Shawnee's back, he gave the roan the spur. What good  could be accomplished by the message he carried now--to bring up half  the horse holders as reinforcements--was a question.    However, he was never to deliver that message, for the horse lines had  been stampeded by the first wave of flying men. Here and there a holder  or two still tried to control at least one wild horse of the four he was  responsible for, but there were no reserves for the fighting line.  And--Drew glanced back--no battle to lead them into if there were.    Men and horses were struggling, dying in the river. The bridge ... he  gaped at the horror of that bridge ... horses down, kicking and dying,  barring an escape route to their riders. And the blue coats everywhere.  Like a stallion about to attack, Shawnee screamed suddenly and reared,"]]]
