[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23875"],[0,"The Relief of Mafeking (#5)"],[1," spent the greater part of the  morning and afternoon, piloted by a naval lieutenant who was in charge  of the embarkation. I perched myself high up on the flying-bridge and  watched the busy scene below. In the next dock was the _Goorkha_, into  whose commodious maw were pouring the 2nd Lincolnshire Regiment, the 9th  Field Company Royal Engineers, the 14th Brigade Staff, the Cavalry  Brigade Field Hospital, the Fifth Division Field Hospital, and No. 12  Company Army Medical Corps. Further away, alongside the dock extension  jetty, the _Braemar Castle_ was receiving the 1st King's Own Scottish  Borderers, No. 7 Bearer Company, and No. 19 Company Army Medical Corps.  In the _Assaye_, however, were men of only two colours, the Norfolks and  the Hampshires. The Norfolks arrived first, and were promptly embarked.  The 'tween-decks of the _Assaye_, having been constructed specially for  the purpose, were more commodious than those on most other transports,  and certainly they were better ventilated, for a great open shaft ran  right up from the bottom of the ship to the upper deck, and round this  were grouped the tables at which the men, in messes of sixteen, were to  be accommodated. The men seemed pleased with their quarters and with the  general arrangements made for their comfort, but they were almost  laughably critical. The fact was that the soldiers were in great danger  of being spoiled by the fuss that had been made of them before they  embarked. It is well that we should cheer the soldiers up by our  enthusiasm, but, as everyone knows, the British public did much more  than that. \"Tommy Atkins\" was the rage for the moment, and what may be  called \"Absent-minded Beggarism\" was rampant. Unfortunately, this  enthusiasm found a vent too often in silly and thoughtless squandering  of money on the soldiers. They were banqueted before they started; their  friends used to ply them with drink; mayors were waiting upon them at  every turn with pipes and tobacco, and total strangers showered money  on them quite recklessly. For example, while I was on the _Assaye's_  bridge I saw a civilian, standing quite apart from the crowd, with his  hat full of copper and small silver coins. No one seemed to be watching  him. He could have no thought of making an impression. But in an ecstasy  of enthusiasm he kept throwing showers of money to the troops on deck.  It is an excellent thing that the people at home should be touched with  such gratitude to the men who fight for them, but, like all great public  movements which have more heart than head in them, this kind of thing  was sometimes overdone, and failed in its object. One saw the men  sometimes arriving drunken, grumbling, and impudent; criticising the  quality or quantity of the refreshments which the steamship company had  thoughtfully provided for them, and generally behaving in a way most  unlike what one would expect. No one seemed to lack money, although so  much was spent in drink. Several times that day I heard men at the  canteen calling for whisky and soda or brandy and potash, and grumbling  heartily when they were not supplied.    With regard to the way in which men got drink one or two things fall to  be said. Every effort was made by the authorities to prevent  drunkenness. One of the naval embarkation officers told me that drink  was not supplied to the men at the canteen, that they were forbidden to  bring any on board, and that they were forbidden to buy or receive any  from civilians; yet it had been found that certain tradesmen at  Southampton had deliberately smuggled whisky on board by heavily bribing  some of the crew. In the face of this kind of thing the officers could  do little. They spoke very bitterly of the cruelty to the men involved  in such practices, for the soldiers are necessarily packed pretty close  together when hammocks are slung, and when the effects of drunkenness  are added to the horrors of sea-sickness the result is awful, and almost  unendurable by a man who cherishes any self-respect. I mention this at  some length because, although it was not prominent on the day of which I  am writing, it had happened terribly often, and on the day before it had  made the scene at the embarkation of an Irish regiment a really horrible  one. The two regiments which embarked on the _Assaye_ happened to be the  soberest I had yet seen. Indeed, there was hardly one case of  drunkenness amongst them. I think this was partly because the outside  public was not allowed near the ship. The men passed from the train  directly on board, and did not come in contact with their friends. It  was kinder to the friends too. I saw none of those heartrending tragic  scenes of parting, none of the wild grief that grows so much wilder for  being indulged. From the officers' deck the picture of embarkation  appeared in outline rather than in detail. The constant movement of  people far below, the orderly disorder, the shouts and cries of officers  and stevedores, the waving arms of cranes and the general excitement  produced in a mere onlooker a strange sense of isolation. One felt like  Gulliver observing the Liliputians in some great effort of maritime  preparation, and the longer one looked the smaller and more like toy  soldiers seemed the men. Such an endless stream of them poured from the  dock shed to the ship. I heard their cries faintly. \"Bring back old  Kroojer's whiskers\" was the burden of them, and this was indeed the  chief trophy, the chief spoil of war which the average soldier pictured  for himself. It was strange to think that this army of Liliput which  tramped and cried down there conceived its mission so vaguely and  imperfectly that it could depart light-heartedly.    The deep note of the _Goorkha's_ foghorn sounded close at hand. The tops  of her masts glided past the roof of the dock shed; in five minutes she  was out of sight, and her departure seemed to have been almost  uncelebrated. She got away at about two, and an hour later the _Braemar  Castle_ also departed.    The only thing which now delayed the departure of the _Assaye_ was the  embarkation of the horses. There were eight chargers belonging to  officers of the two regiments, and they made the utmost objection to  being enclosed in narrow boxes and swung in mid-air. In particular a  magnificent grey belonging to the colonel of the Hampshire Regiment gave  any amount of trouble. It took her groom ten minutes to coax her into  the box, and as soon as it began to move upwards she snorted and  trembled with fear, and finally sat down on her haunches, with her neck  hanging over the door. The colonel, who was standing near, seemed rather  proud of this exhibition, but when the mare was almost beside herself  with terror, and while she was yet swinging in mid-air, he spoke  reassuring words--\"Woa, Bunny! Steady, old girl!\" The beast could not  see him, but she heard the voice in the air, and became suddenly quiet.  May she live to need the same assurance on her homeward journey, was  one's involuntary thought. The sight of these fine horses was very  pitiful, in the light of their possible destiny. One looked at the  glossy coats and saw them torn and bloody. One watched the nervous wild  eye and the twitching ears, and heard the whistling bullets and the  shells bursting round them, who know no reason for the commotion,  holding themselves bravely in check until the steadying voice behind  them ceases and the load suddenly lightens, or until a stray bullet ends  both fears and endeavours.    After many delays the last horse was on board. And now there remained  only the inspection by the naval embarkation officers, an interval for  the crowd of half an hour, which the band on the quay did its best to  pass agreeably. There were many false alarms of departure. Every  patriotic song and tune had been played and cheered, but after \"Auld  Lang Syne\" had been hammered out for the third time the ship began to  move. As she left the quay the younger men at one end of the ship made a  great commotion. One held up a flag which he proposed to plant on  \"Kroojer's Hill.\" (Some authorities might read Majuba.) These men,  recruits for the most part, made in their ignorance of war a joyful  noise, but the Reservists and old hands looked grave and sad, and hardly  joined in the singing or cheering. They were thinking.          III    HOW THE WOUNDED CAME HOME      Going down Southampton Water on January 5th to meet the _Aurania_ with  her company of sick and wounded, one enjoyed a wonderful study of sober  tints in land and sea under a winter sky. The little steamer clove light  green waters that were hardly rippled by the breeze. This green sea she  divided in two long curling lines that seemed to reach the shore on  either hand, merging their light colour with a dark green of fields  waiting for spring. The fields in their turn faded into the bluish black  of leafless trees, and the trees bounded a sky of soft banks shading  from blue to grey. The waters seemed almost deserted, except for a ship  that now and then might meet us, stealing up on the tide and gently  heeling to the breeze. Sometimes a yacht would pass us, sometimes a  fishing-smack; but it was a lonely journey. The air was soft and  sweet--not like that of spring, but like that of a world which lives in  the promise of a coming spring and can wait. There were no sounds but  one sweet and familiar--the whisper, swelling and diminishing but never  dying, of foam at the cutwater.    Little Hythe seemed to have retired into itself for the winter. Its pier  was deserted by boats and men when we passed. Lower down on the other  side was Netley Hospital, with how many pains and agonies hidden behind  its long, imposing front. Opposite Netley the sea eats and bites like an  acid into a kind of mossy grass of rare and vivid green, making a  wonderful coast-line on a small scale, with bays and channels and  sounds.

The embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul,    At every act sits godlike in \"the town    Which hath nine gateways,\"[FN#9] neither doing aught    Nor causing any deed. This world's Lord makes    Neither the work, nor passion for the work,    Nor lust for fruit of work; the man's own self    Pushes to these! The Master of this World    Takes on himself the good or evil deeds    Of no man--dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here    By folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom    That darkness of the soul is chased by light,    Splendid and clear shines manifest the Truth    As if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed    Its beams of dawn. Him meditating still,    Him seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,    The souls illuminated take that road    Which hath no turning back--their sins flung off    By strength of faith. [Who will may have this Light;    Who hath it sees.] To him who wisely sees,    The Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities,    The cow, the elephant, the unclean dog,    The Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one.      The world is overcome--aye! even here!    By such as fix their faith on Unity.    The sinless Brahma dwells in Unity,    And they in Brahma. Be not over-glad    Attaining joy, and be not over-sad    Encountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still    Constant let each abide! The sage whose soul    Holds off from outer contacts, in himself    Finds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety,    His spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys    Springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs    Which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!    The wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son!    In such as those! But if a man shall learn,    Even while he lives and bears his body's chain,    To master lust and anger, he is blest!    He is the Yukta; he hath happiness,    Contentment, light, within: his life is merged    In Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch!    Thus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell    With sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts    Governed and calm. Glad in all good they live,    Nigh to the peace of God; and all those live    Who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath,    Subduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!      The Saint who shuts outside his placid soul    All touch of sense, letting no contact through;    Whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows,    Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn    Equal and slow through nostrils still and close;    That one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained,    Bent on deliverance, having put away    Passion, and fear, and rage;--hath, even now,    Obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed.    Yea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds    The sacrifice and worship, God revealed;    And He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds,    Lover of all that lives, God unrevealed,    Wherein who will shall find surety and shield!      HERE ENDS CHAPTER V. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,    Entitled \"Karmasanyasayog,\"    Or \"The Book of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works.\"            CHAPTER VI        Krishna.    Therefore, who doeth work rightful to do,    Not seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince!    Is Sanyasi and Yogi--both in one    And he is neither who lights not the flame    Of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task.      Regard as true Renouncer him that makes    Worship by work, for who renounceth not    Works not as Yogin. So is that well said:    \"By works the votary doth rise to faith,    And saintship is the ceasing from all works;    Because the perfect Yogin acts--but acts    Unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,    Setting result aside.      Let each man raise    The Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,    Since Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe.    Soul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self,    But Self turns enemy if Soul's own self    Hates Self as not itself.[FN#10]      The sovereign soul    Of him who lives self-governed and at peace    Is centred in itself, taking alike    Pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.    He is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad    With joy of light and truth; dwelling apart    Upon a peak, with senses subjugate    Whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold    Show all as one. By this sign is he known    Being of equal grace to comrades, friends,    Chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,    Aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,    Evil or good.      Sequestered should he sit,    Steadfastly meditating, solitary,    His thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,    Quit of belongings. In a fair, still spot    Having his fixed abode,--not too much raised,    Nor yet too low,--let him abide, his goods    A cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.    There, setting hard his mind upon The One,    Restraining heart and senses, silent, calm,    Let him accomplish Yoga, and achieve    Pureness of soul, holding immovable    Body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed    Upon his nose-end,[FN#11] rapt from all around,    Tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent    Upon his Brahmacharya vow, devout,    Musing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.    That Yojin, so devoted, so controlled,    Comes to the peace beyond,--My peace, the peace    Of high Nirvana!      But for earthly needs    Religion is not his who too much fasts    Or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away    An idle mind; nor his who wears to waste    His strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! call    That the true piety which most removes    Earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate    In eating and in resting, and in sport;    Measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,    Waking betimes for duty.      When the man,    So living, centres on his soul the thought    Straitly restrained--untouched internally    By stress of sense--then is he Yukta. See!    Steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;    Such is the likeness of the Yogi's mind    Shut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.    When mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;    When Self contemplates self, and in itself    Hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy    Beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul--    Only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,    True to the farther Truth; when, holding this,    It deems no other treasure comparable,    But, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook    By any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\"    That happy severance Yoga; call that man    The perfect Yogin!      Steadfastly the will    Must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,    And thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off    All longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,    Shutting the doorways of the senses close    With watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes    To gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,    When the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods    Cumberless. But, as often as the heart    Breaks--wild and wavering--from control, so oft    Let him re-curb it, let him rein it back    To the soul's governance; for perfect bliss    Grows only in the bosom tranquillised,    The spirit passionless, purged from offence,    Vowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows    His soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,    Passes unhindered to the endless bliss    Of unity with Brahma. He so vowed,    So blended, sees the Life-Soul resident    In all things living, and all living things    In that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus    Discerneth Me in all, and all in Me,    I never let him go; nor looseneth he    Hold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,    Whate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,    Because he knows and worships Me, Who dwell    In all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.    Arjuna! if a man sees everywhere--    Taught by his own similitude--one Life,    One Essence in the Evil and the Good,    Hold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!      Arjuna.    Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,    This Peace, derived from equanimity,    Made known by thee--I see no fixity    Therein, no rest, because the heart of men    Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,    Wilful and strong. It were all one, I think,    To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.      Krishna.    Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard    Man's heart is to restrain, and wavering;    Yet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!    By wont of self-command. This Yog, I say,    Cometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;    But he who will be master of himself    Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.      Arjuna.    And what road goeth he who, having faith,    Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back    From holiness, missing the perfect rule?    Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,    Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven    When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?    Fain would I hear thee answer me herein,    Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.      Krishna.    He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No!    Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,    Because no heart that holds one right desire    Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,    Desiring righteousness, cometh at death    Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there    Measureless years, and being born anew,    Beginneth life again in some fair home    Amid the mild and happy. It may chance    He doth descend into a Yogin house    On Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth    Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!    So hath he back again what heights of heart    He did achieve, and so he strives anew    To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!    For by the old desire he is drawn on    Unwittingly; and only to desire    The purity of Yog is to pass    Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.    But, being Yogi, striving strong and long,    Purged from transgressions, perfected by births    Following on births, he plants his feet at last    Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks"]]]
