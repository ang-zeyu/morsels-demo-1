For over 40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the  principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of  production. In recent years Albania has implemented limited economic  reforms to stimulate its lagging economy, provide incentives, and  decentralize decisionmaking. In an effort to expand international  ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the Soviet  Union and the US. The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing  foreign investment. Albania possesses considerable mineral  resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient in food;  several years of drought have hindered agricultural development.  Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are subject to an  especially wide margin of error because the government until recently  did not release economic information.      _#_GNP: $4.1 billion, per capita $1,250; real growth rate NA% (1990  est.)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): NA%      _#_Unemployment rate: NA%      _#_Budget: revenues $2.3 billion; expenditures $2.3 billion,  including capital expenditures of NA (1989)      _#_Exports: $378 million (f.o.b., 1987 est.);    commodities--asphalt, bitumen, petroleum products, metals and  metallic ores, electricity, oil, vegetables, fruits, tobacco;    partners--Italy, Yugoslavia, FRG, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Poland,  Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary      _#_Imports: $255 million (f.o.b., 1987 est.);    commodities--machinery, machine tools, iron and steel products,  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals;    partners--Italy, Yugoslavia, FRG, Czechoslovakia, Romania,  Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, GDR      _#_External debt: $NA      _#_Industrial production: growth rate NA      _#_Electricity: 1,690,000 kW capacity; 5,000 million kWh produced,  1,530 kWh per capita (1990)      _#_Industries: food processing, textiles and clothing, lumber,  oil, cement, chemicals, basic metals, hydropower      _#_Agriculture: arable land per capita among lowest in Europe;  one-half of work force engaged in farming; produces wide range of  temperate-zone crops and livestock; claims self-sufficiency in grain  output      _#_Economic aid: Western (non-US) countries, ODA (1988) $5.8 million      _#_Currency: lek (plural--leke); 1 lek (L) = 100 qintars      _#_Exchange rates: leke (L) per US$1--8.00 (noncommercial fixed rate  since 1986), 4.14 (commercial fixed rate since 1987)      _#_Fiscal year: calendar year      _*_Communications  _#_Railroads: 543 km total; 509 1.435-meter standard gauge, single  track and 34 km narrow gauge, single track (1990); line connecting  Titograd (Yugoslavia) and Shkoder (Albania) completed August 1986      _#_Highways: 16,700 km total; 6,700 km highway and roads, 10,000 km  forest and agricultural (1990)      _#_Inland waterways: 43 km plus Albanian sections of Lake Scutari,  Lake Ohrid, and Lake Prespa (1990)      _#_Pipelines: crude oil, 145 km; refined products, 55 km; natural gas,  64 km (1988)      _#_Ports: Durres, Sarande, Vlore      _#_Merchant marine: 11 cargo ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 52,886  GRT/75,993 DWT      _#_Airports: 12 total, 10 usable; more than 5 with permanent-surface  runways; more than 5 with runways 2,440-3,659 m; 5 with runways  1,220-2,439 m      _#_Telecommunications: stations--17 AM, 1 FM, 9 TV; 246,000 TVs  (1990); 210,000 radios      _*_Defense Forces  _#_Branches: Albanian People's Army, Albanian Coastal Defense Command,  Air and Air Defense Force, Frontier Troops, Interior Troops      _#_Manpower availability: males 15-49, 900,723; 743,594 fit for  military service; 33,497 reach military age (19) annually      _#_Defense expenditures: 1.0 billion leks, NA% of GDP (FY90);  note--conversion of defense expenditures into US dollars using the  official administratively set exchange rate would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25012"],[0,"The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche Contra Wagner, and Selected Aphorisms. (#5)"],[1,"holiest to be  scientific.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The \"Flying Dutchman\" preaches the sublime doctrine that  woman can moor the most erratic soul, or to put it into Wagnerian terms  \"save\" him. Here we venture to ask a question. Supposing that this were  actually true, would it therefore be desirable?--What becomes of the  \"eternal Jew\" whom a woman adores and _enchains_? He simply ceases from  being eternal, he marries,--that is to say, he concerns us no  longer.--Transferred into the realm of reality, the danger for the artist  and for the genius--and these are of course the \"eternal Jews\"--resides in  woman: _adoring_ women are their ruin. Scarcely any one has sufficient  character not to be corrupted--\"saved\" when he finds himself treated as a  God--he then immediately condescends to woman.--Man is a coward in the face  of all that is eternally feminine, and this the girls know.--In many cases  of woman's love, and perhaps precisely in the most famous ones, the love  is no more than a refined form of _parasitism_, a making one's nest in  another's soul and sometimes even in another's flesh--Ah! and how  constantly at the cost of the host!    We know the fate of Goethe in old-maidish moralin-corroded Germany. He was  always offensive to Germans, he found honest admirers only among Jewesses.  Schiller, \"noble\" Schiller, who cried flowery words into their ears,--he  was a man after their own heart. What did they reproach Goethe with?--with  the Mount of Venus, and with having composed certain Venetian epigrams.  Even Klopstock preached him a moral sermon; there was a time when Herder  was fond of using the word \"Priapus\" when he spoke of Goethe. Even  \"Wilhelm Meister\" seemed to be only a symptom of decline, of a moral  \"going to the dogs\". The \"Menagerie of tame cattle,\" the worthlessness of  the hero in this book, revolted Niebuhr, who finally bursts out in a  plaint which _Biterolf_(8) might well have sung: \"nothing so easily makes  a painful impression as _when a great mind despoils itself of its wings  and strives for virtuosity in something greatly inferior, while it  renounces more lofty aims_.\" But the most indignant of all was the  cultured woman--all smaller courts in Germany, every kind of \"Puritanism\"  made the sign of the cross at the sight of Goethe, at the thought of the  \"unclean spirit\" in Goethe.--This history was what Wagner set to music. He  _saves_ Goethe, that goes without saying; but he does so in such a clever  way that he also takes the side of the cultured woman. Goethe gets saved:  a prayer saves him, a cultured woman _draws him out of the mire_.    --As to what Goethe would have thought of Wagner?--Goethe once set himself  the question, \"what danger hangs over all romanticists--the fate of  romanticists?\"--His answer was: \"To choke over the rumination of moral and  religious absurdities.\" In short: _Parsifal_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The philosopher writes  thereto an epilogue: _Holiness_--the only remaining higher value still seen  by the mob or by woman, the horizon of the ideal for all those who are  naturally short-sighted. To philosophers, however, this horizon, like  every other, is a mere misunderstanding, a sort of slamming of the door in  the face of the real beginning of their world,--their danger, their ideal,  their desideratum.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} In more polite language: _La philosophie ne suffit pas  au grand nombre. Il lui faut la saintete.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}_          4.      I shall once more relate the history of the \"Ring\". This is its proper  place. It is also the history of a salvation except that in this case it  is Wagner himself who is saved--Half his lifetime Wagner believed in the  _Revolution_ as only a Frenchman could have believed in it. He sought it  in the runic inscriptions of myths, he thought he had found a typical  revolutionary in Siegfried.--\"Whence arises all the evil in this world?\"  Wagner asked himself. From \"old contracts\": he replied, as all  revolutionary ideologists have done. In plain English: from customs, laws,  morals, institutions, from all those things upon which the ancient world  and ancient society rests. \"How can one get rid of the evil in this world?  How can one get rid of ancient society?\" Only by declaring war against  \"contracts\" (traditions, morality). _This Siegfried does._ He starts early  at the game, very early--his origin itself is already a declaration of war  against morality--he is the result of adultery, of incest.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Not the saga,  but Wagner himself is the inventor of this radical feature, in this matter  he _corrected_ the saga.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Siegfried continues as he began: he follows only  his first impulse, he flings all tradition, all respect, all _fear_ to the  winds. Whatever displeases him he strikes down. He tilts irreverently at  old god-heads. His principal undertaking, however, is to emancipate  woman,--\"to deliver Brunnhilda.\"{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Siegfried and Brunnhilda, the sacrament  of free love, the dawn of the golden age, the twilight of the Gods of old  morality--_evil is got rid of_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} For a long while Wagner's ship sailed  happily along this course. There can be no doubt that along it Wagner  sought his highest goal.--What happened? A misfortune. The ship dashed on  to a reef; Wagner had run aground. The reef was Schopenhauer's philosophy;  Wagner had stuck fast on a _contrary_ view of the world. What had he set  to music? Optimism? Wagner was ashamed. It was moreover an optimism for  which Schopenhauer had devised an evil expression,--_unscrupulous_  optimism. He was more than ever ashamed. He reflected for some time; his  position seemed desperate.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} At last a path of escape seemed gradually to  open before him--what if the reef on which he had been wrecked could be  interpreted as a goal, as the ulterior motive, as the actual purpose of  his journey? To be wrecked here, this was also a goal:--_Bene navigavi cum  naufragium feci_ {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} and he translated the \"Ring\" into Schopenhauerian  language. Everything goes wrong, everything goes to wrack and ruin, the  new world is just as bad as the old one:--Nonentity, the Indian Circe  beckons {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Brunnhilda, who according to the old plan had to retire with a  song in honour of free love, consoling the world with the hope of a  socialistic Utopia in which \"all will be well\"; now gets something else to  do. She must first study Schopenhauer. She must first versify the fourth  book of \"The World as Will and Idea.\" _Wagner was saved.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}_ Joking apart,  this _was_ a salvation. The service which Wagner owes to Schopenhauer is  incalculable. It was the _philosopher of decadence_ who allowed the  _artist of decadence_ to find himself.--          5.      _The artist of decadence._ That is the word. And here I begin to be  serious. I could not think of looking on approvingly while this _decadent_  spoils our health--and music into the bargain. Is Wagner a man at all? Is  he not rather a disease? Everything he touches he contaminates. _He has  made music sick._    A typical _decadent_ who thinks himself necessary with his corrupted  taste, who arrogates to himself a higher taste, who tries to establish his  depravity as a law, as progress, as a fulfilment.    And no one guards against it. His powers of seduction attain monstrous  proportions, holy incense hangs around him, the misunderstanding  concerning him is called the Gospel,--and he has certainly not converted  only the _poor in spirit_ to his cause!    I should like to open the window a little:--Air! More air!--    The fact that people in Germany deceive themselves concerning Wagner does  not surprise me. The reverse would surprise me. The Germans have modelled  a Wagner for themselves, whom they can honour: never yet have they been  psychologists; they are thankful that they misunderstand. But that people  should also deceive themselves concerning Wagner in Paris! Where people  are scarcely anything else than psychologists. And in Saint Petersburg!  Where things are divined, which even Paris has no idea of. How intimately  related must Wagner be to the entire decadence of Europe for her not to  have felt that he was decadent! He belongs to it, he is its protagonist,  its greatest name.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} We bring honour on ourselves by elevating him to the  clouds--For the mere fact that no one guards against him is in itself  already a sign of decadence. Instinct is weakened, what ought to be  eschewed now attracts. People actually kiss that which plunges them more  quickly into the abyss.--Is there any need for an example? One has only to  think of the regime which anaemic, or gouty, or diabetic people prescribe  for themselves. The definition of a vegetarian: a creature who has need of  a corroborating diet. To recognise what is harmful as harmful, to be able  to deny oneself what is harmful, is a sign of youth, of vitality. That  which is harmful lures the exhausted: cabbage lures the vegetarian.  Illness itself can be a stimulus to life but one must be healthy enough  for such a stimulus!--Wagner increases exhaustion--_therefore_ he attracts  the weak and exhausted to him. Oh, the rattlesnake joy of the old Master  precisely because he always saw \"the little children\" coming unto him!    I place this point of view first and foremost: Wagner's art is diseased.  The problems he sets on the stage are all concerned with hysteria; the  convulsiveness of his emotions, his over-excited sensitiveness, his taste  which demands ever sharper condimentation, his erraticness which he togged  out to look like principles, and, last but not least, his choice of heroes  and heroines, considered as physiological types (--a hospital ward!--): the  whole represents a morbid picture; of this there can be no doubt. _Wagner  est une nevrose_. Maybe, that nothing is better"]]]
