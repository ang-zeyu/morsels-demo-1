The Chief of the Police in these days was a grey man, rather tired, with  a hawk nose and deep eyes that glared under shaggy eyebrows and he was a  terror to all men of his department save to T. X. who respected nothing  on earth and very little elsewhere. He nodded curtly to Mansus.    \"Well, T. X.,\" he said, \"what have you discovered about our friend  Kara?\"    He turned from T. X. to the discomforted inspector.    \"Very little,\" said T. X. \"I've had Mansus on the job.\"    \"And you've found nothing, eh?\" growled the Chief.    \"He has found all that it is possible to find,\" said T. X. \"We do not  perform miracles in this department, Sir George, nor can we pick up the  threads of a case at five minutes' notice.\"    Sir George Haley grunted.    \"Mansus has done his best,\" the other went on easily, \"but it is rather  absurd to talk about one's best when you know so little of what you  want.\"    Sir George dropped heavily into the arm-chair, and stretched out his  long thin legs.    \"What I want,\" he said, looking up at the ceiling and putting his hands  together, \"is to discover something about one Remington Kara, a wealthy  Greek who has taken a house in Cadogan Square, who has no particular  position in London society and therefore has no reason for coming  here, who openly expresses his detestation of the climate, who has  a magnificent estate in some wild place in the Balkans, who is an  excellent horseman, a magnificent shot and a passable aviator.\"    T. X. nodded to Mansus and with something of gratitude in his eyes the  inspector took his leave.    \"Now Mansus has departed,\" said T. X., sitting himself on the edge of  his desk and selecting with great care a cigarette from the case he took  from his pocket, \"let me know something of the reason for this sudden  interest in the great ones of the earth.\"    Sir George smiled grimly.    \"I have the interest which is the interest of my department,\" he said.  \"That is to say I want to know a great deal about abnormal people. We  have had an application from him,\" he went on, \"which is rather unusual.  Apparently he is in fear of his life from some cause or other and wants  to know if he can have a private telephone connection between his house  and the central office. We told him that he could always get the nearest  Police Station on the 'phone, but that doesn't satisfy him. He has made  bad friends with some gentleman of his own country who sooner or later,  he thinks, will cut his throat.\"    T. X. nodded.    \"All this I know,\" he said patiently, \"if you will further unfold the  secret dossier, Sir George, I am prepared to be thrilled.\"    \"There is nothing thrilling about it,\" growled the older man, rising,  \"but I remember the Macedonian shooting case in South London and I don't  want a repetition of that sort of thing. If people want to have blood  feuds, let them take them outside the metropolitan area.\"    \"By all means,\" said T. X., \"let them. Personally, I don't care where  they go. But if that is the extent of your information I can supplement  it. He has had extensive alterations made to the house he bought in  Cadogan Square; the room in which he lives is practically a safe.\"    Sir George raised his eyebrows.    \"A safe,\" he repeated.    T. X. nodded.    \"A safe,\" he said; \"its walls are burglar proof, floor and roof are  reinforced concrete, there is one door which in addition to its ordinary  lock is closed by a sort of steel latch which he lets fall when he  retires for the night and which he opens himself personally in the  morning. The window is unreachable, there are no communicating doors,  and altogether the room is planned to stand a siege.\"    The Chief Commissioner was interested.    \"Any more?\" he asked.    \"Let me think,\" said T. X., looking up at the ceiling. \"Yes, the  interior of his room is plainly furnished, there is a big fireplace,  rather an ornate bed, a steel safe built into the wall and visible from  its outer side to the policeman whose beat is in that neighborhood.\"    \"How do you know all this?\" asked the Chief Commissioner.    \"Because I've been in the room,\" said T. X. simply, \"having by an  underhand trick succeeded in gaining the misplaced confidence of Kara's  housekeeper, who by the way\"--he turned round to his desk and scribbled  a name on the blotting-pad--\"will be discharged to-morrow and must be  found a place.\"    \"Is there any--er--?\" began the Chief.    \"Funny business?\" interrupted T. X., \"not a bit. House and man are quite  normal save for these eccentricities. He has announced his intention of  spending three months of the year in England and nine months abroad. He  is very rich, has no relations, and has a passion for power.\"    \"Then he'll be hung,\" said the Chief, rising.    \"I doubt it,\" said the other, \"people with lots of money seldom get  hung. You only get hung for wanting money.\"    \"Then you're in some danger, T. X.,\" smiled the Chief, \"for according to  my account you're always more or less broke.\"    \"A genial libel,\" said T. X., \"but talking about people being broke, I  saw John Lexman to-day--you know him!\"    The Chief Commissioner nodded.    \"I've an idea he's rather hit for money. He was in that Roumanian gold  swindle, and by his general gloom, which only comes to a man when he's  in love (and he can't possibly be in love since he's married) or when  he's in debt, I fear that he is still feeling the effect of that rosy  adventure.\"    A telephone bell in the corner of the room rang sharply, and T. X.  picked up the receiver. He listened intently.    \"A trunk call,\" he said over his shoulder to the departing commissioner,  \"it may be something interesting.\"    A little pause; then a hoarse voice spoke to him. \"Is that you, T. X.?\"    \"That's me,\" said the Assistant Commissioner, commonly.    \"It's John Lexman speaking.\"    \"I shouldn't have recognized your voice,\" said T. X., \"what is wrong  with you, John, can't you get your plot to went?\"    \"I want you to come down here at once,\" said the voice urgently, and  even over the telephone T. X. recognized the distress. \"I have shot a  man, killed him!\"    T. X. gasped.    \"Good Lord,\" he said, \"you are a silly ass!\"          CHAPTER III      In the early hours of the morning a tragic little party was assembled in  the study at Beston Priory. John Lexman, white and haggard, sat on the  sofa with his wife by his side. Immediate authority as represented by  a village constable was on duty in the passage outside, whilst T. X.  sitting at the table with a writing pad and a pencil was briefly noting  the evidence.    The author had sketched the events of the day. He had described his  interview with the money-lender the day before and the arrival of the  letter.    \"You have the letter!\" asked T. X.    John Lexman nodded.    \"I am glad of that,\" said the other with a sigh of relief, \"that will  save you from a great deal of unpleasantness, my poor old chap. Tell me  what happened afterward.\"    \"I reached the village,\" said John Lexman, \"and passed through it. There  was nobody about, the rain was still falling very heavily and indeed I  didn't meet a single soul all the evening. I reached the place appointed  about five minutes before time. It was the corner of Eastbourne Road  on the station side and there I found Vassalaro waiting. I was rather  ashamed of myself at meeting him at all under these conditions, but I  was very keen on his not coming to the house for I was afraid it would  upset Grace. What made it all the more ridiculous was this infernal  pistol which was in my pocket banging against my side with every step I  took as though to nudge me to an understanding of my folly.\"    \"Where did you meet Vassalaro?\" asked T. X.    \"He was on the other side of the Eastbourne Road and crossed the road  to meet me. At first he was very pleasant though a little agitated but  afterward he began to behave in a most extraordinary manner as though he  was lashing himself up into a fury which he didn't feel. I promised him  a substantial amount on account, but he grew worse and worse and then,  suddenly, before I realised what he was doing, he was brandishing a  revolver in my face and uttering the most extraordinary threats. Then it  was I remembered Kara's warning.\"    \"Kara,\" said T. X. quickly.    \"A man I know and who was responsible for introducing me to Vassalaro.  He is immensely wealthy.\"    \"I see,\" said T. X., \"go on.\"    \"I remembered this warning,\" the other proceeded, \"and I thought it  worth while trying it out to see if it had any effect upon the little  man. I pulled the pistol from my pocket and pointed it at him, but that  only seemed to make it--and then I pressed the trigger....    \"To my horror four shots exploded before I could recover sufficient  self-possession to loosen my hold of the butt. He fell without a word.  I dropped the revolver and knelt by his side. I could tell he was  dangerously wounded, and indeed I knew at that moment that nothing would  save him. My pistol had been pointed in the region of his heart....\"    He shuddered, dropping his face in his hands, and the girl by his side,  encircling his shoulder with a protecting arm, murmured something in his  ear. Presently he recovered.    \"He wasn't quite dead. I heard him murmur something but I wasn't able  to distinguish what he said. I went straight to the village and told the  constable and had the body removed.\"    T. X. rose from the table and walked to the door and opened it.    \"Come in, constable,\" he said, and when the man made his appearance,  \"I suppose you were very careful in removing this body, and you took  everything which was lying about in the immediate vicinity'?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" replied the man, \"I took his hat and his walkingstick, if  that's what you mean.\"    \"And the revolver!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],[0,"Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#5)"],[1,"  _forming_ alumine.

Oh, what a formidable list! You will have much to do to explain it,  Mrs. B.; for I assure you it is perfectly unintelligible to me, and I  think rather perplexes than assists me.    MRS. B.    Do not let that alarm you, my dear; I hope that hereafter this  classification will appear quite clear, and, so far from perplexing you,  will assist you in arranging your ideas. It would be in vain to attempt  forming a division that would appear perfectly clear to a beginner: for  you may easily conceive that a chemical division being necessarily  founded on properties with which you are almost wholly unacquainted, it  is impossible that you should at once be able to understand its meaning  or appreciate its utility.    But, before we proceed further, it will be necessary to give you some  idea of chemical attraction, a power on which the whole science depends.    _Chemical Attraction_, or the _Attraction of Composition_, consists in  the peculiar tendency which bodies of a different nature have to unite  with each other. It is by this force that all the compositions, and  decompositions, are effected.    EMILY.    What is the difference between chemical attraction, and the attraction  of cohesion, or of aggregation, which you often mentioned to us, in  former conversations?    MRS. B.    The attraction of cohesion exists only between particles of the _same_  nature, whether simple or compound; thus it unites the particles of a  piece of metal which is a simple substance, and likewise the particles  of a loaf of bread which is a compound. The attraction of composition,  on the contrary, unites and maintains, in a state of combination,  particles of a _dissimilar_ nature; it is this power that forms each of  the compound particles of which bread consists; and it is by the  attraction of cohesion that all these particles are connected into a  single mass.    EMILY.    The attraction of cohesion, then, is the power which unites the  integrant particles of a body: the attraction of composition that which  combines the constituent particles. Is it not so?    MRS. B.    Precisely: and observe that the attraction of cohesion unites particles  of a similar nature, without changing their original properties; the  result of such an union, therefore, is a body of the same kind as the  particles of which it is formed; whilst the attraction of composition,  by combining particles of a dissimilar nature, produces compound bodies,  quite different from any of their constituents. If, for instance, I pour  on the piece of copper, contained in this glass, some of this liquid  (which is called nitric acid), for which it has a strong attraction,  every particle of the copper will combine with a particle of acid, and  together they will form a new body, totally different from either the  copper or the acid.    Do you observe the internal commotion that already begins to take place?  It is produced by the combination of these two substances; and yet the  acid has in this case to overcome not only the resistance which the  strong cohesion of the particles of copper opposes to their combination  with it, but also to overcome the weight of the copper, which makes it  sink to the bottom of the glass, and prevents the acid from having such  free access to it as it would if the metal were suspended in the liquid.    EMILY.    The acid seems, however, to overcome both these obstacles without  difficulty, and appears to be very rapidly dissolving the copper.    MRS. B.    By this means it reduces the copper into more minute parts than could  possibly be done by any mechanical power. But as the acid can act only  on the surface of the metal, it will be some time before the union of  these two bodies will be completed.    You may, however, already see how totally different this compound is  from either of its ingredients. It is neither colourless, like the acid,  nor hard, heavy, and yellow like the copper. If you tasted it, you would  no longer perceive the sourness of the acid. It has at present the  appearance of a blue liquid; but when the union is completed, and the  water with which the acid is diluted is evaporated, the compound will  assume the form of regular crystals, of a fine blue colour, and  perfectly transparent*. Of these I can shew you a specimen, as I have  prepared some for that purpose.        [Footnote *: These crystals are more easily obtained from a      mixture of sulphuric with a little nitric acid.]    CAROLINE.    How very beautiful they are, in colour, form, and transparency!    EMILY.    Nothing can be more striking than this example of chemical attraction.    MRS. B.    The term _attraction_ has been lately introduced into chemistry as a  substitute for the word _affinity_, to which some chemists have  objected, because it originated in the vague notion that chemical  combinations depended upon a certain resemblance, or relationship,  between particles that are disposed to unite; and this idea is not only  imperfect, but erroneous, as it is generally particles of the most  dissimilar nature, that have the greatest tendency to combine.    CAROLINE.    Besides, there seems to be no advantage in using a variety of terms to  express the same meaning; on the contrary it creates confusion; and as  we are well acquainted with the term Attraction in natural philosophy,  we had better adopt it in chemistry likewise.    MRS. B.    If you have a clear idea of the meaning, I shall leave you at liberty to  express it in the terms you prefer. For myself, I confess that I think  the word Attraction best suited to the general law that unites the  integrant particles of bodies; and Affinity better adapted to that which  combines the constituent particles, as it may convey an idea of the  preference which some bodies have for others, which the term _attraction  of composition_ does not so well express.    EMILY.    So I think; for though that preference may not result from any  relationship, or similitude, between the particles (as you say was once  supposed), yet, as it really exists, it ought to be expressed.    MRS. B.    Well, let it be agreed that you may use the terms _affinity_, _chemical  attraction_ and _attraction of composition_, indifferently, provided you  recollect that they have all the same meaning.    EMILY.    I do not conceive how bodies can be decomposed by chemical attraction.  That this power should be the means of composing them, is very obvious;  but that it should, at the same time, produce exactly the contrary  effect, appears to me very singular.    MRS. B.    To decompose a body is, you know, to separate its constituent parts,  which, as we have just observed, cannot be done by mechanical means.    EMILY.    No: because mechanical means separate only the integrant particles; they  act merely against the attraction of cohesion, and only divide a  compound into smaller parts.    MRS. B.    The decomposition of a body is performed by chemical powers. If you  present to a body composed of two principles, a third, which has a  greater affinity for one of them than the two first have for each other,  it will be decomposed, that is, its two principles will be separated by  means of the third body. Let us call two ingredients, of which the body  is composed, A and B. If we present to it another ingredient C, which  has a greater affinity for B than that which unites A and B, it  necessarily follows that B will quit A to combine with C. The new  ingredient, therefore, has effected a decomposition of the original body  A B; A has been left alone, and a new compound, B C, has been formed.    EMILY.    We might, I think, use the comparison of two friends, who were very  happy in each other's society, till a third disunited them by the  preference which one of them gave to the new-comer.    MRS. B.    Very well. I shall now show you how this takes place in chemistry.    Let us suppose that we wish to decompose the compound we have just  formed by the combination of the two ingredients, copper and nitric  acid; we may do this by presenting to it a piece of iron, for which the  acid has a stronger attraction than for copper; the acid will,  consequently, quit the copper to combine with the iron, and the copper  will be what the chemists call _precipitated_, that is to say, it will  be thrown down in its separate state, and reappear in its simple form.    In order to produce this effect, I shall dip the blade of this knife  into the fluid, and, when I take it out, you will observe, that, instead  of being wetted"]]]
