Taking up  this very volume, he turned to me and remarked, \"This looks a rare  edition, Mr. Stevens; don't you think so? I do not remember having seen  it before,\" and raised the bid to 5s. I replied that I had little doubt  of its rarity, though comparatively a late edition of the Psalms, and at  the same time gave Mr. Wilkinson a sixpenny nod. Thenceforward a  \"spirited competition\" arose between Mr. Lilly and myself, until finally  the lot was knocked down to Stevens for 19s.' The volume had cost the  late Mr. Pickering 3s. It became Mr. Lenox's property for L80.  Twenty-three years later another copy was bought by Mr. Cornelius  Vanderbilt for 1,200 dollars.    In a letter to Justin Windsor, the late J. Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps  gave some very curious and interesting information respecting  book-collecting in the earlier half of the present century. 'About the  year 1836,' he wrote, 'when I first began hunting for old books at the  various stalls in our famous London city, black-letter ones and rare  prints were \"plenty as blackberries,\" and I have often found such things  in unlikely places and amidst a mass of commonplace rubbish, exposed for  sale in boxes labelled, \"These books and pamphlets 6d. or 1s. each,\"  outside an old bookseller's window, where another notice informed the  passer-by that \"Libraries were purchased or books bought;\" and thus  plainly showed how such now indeed rarities came into the possession of  an ignorant bibliopole. It was not, however, till about 1840 that I  turned my attention to the more special work of collecting Shakespeare  quartos, in which, I may say, I have been very successful. It was at one  of George Chalmers' sales that I first bought one or two, and after that  I hunted for them in all parts of the country, and met with considerable  success, often buying duplicates, and even triplicates, of the same  edition and play. At one time I possessed no less than three copies of  the very rare quarto edition of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" 1609, and sometimes  even had four copies of more than one of the other quartos. Not so very  long before this period, old Jolley, the well-known collector, picked up  a Caxton at Reading, and a \"Venus and Adonis,\" 1594, at Manchester, in  a volume of old tracts, for the ignoble sum of 1s. 3d. Jolley was a  wealthy orange-merchant of Farringdon Street, London, and entertained me  often with many stories of similar fortunate finds of rare books, which  served to whet my appetite only the more. But I was soon stopped in my  book-hunting career by the appearance all at once on the scene of a  number of buyers with much longer purses than my own, and thus I was  driven from a market I had derived so much pleasure from with great  regret. Some time afterwards circumstances rendered it desirable that I  should part with a large number of my book-treasures by auction and to  the British Museum; but even then I retained enough to be instrumental  in founding the first Shakespearian library in Scotland, by presenting  to the University of Edinburgh, amongst other rarities, nearly fifty  copies of original quartos of Shakespeare's plays, printed before the  Restoration, and to keep sufficient myself of the rarest and most  valuable examples.'    Sometimes the notes of a former possessor have a considerable literary  interest, as, for example, the copy of Stowe's 'Survey of London,' 1618,  presented to the Penzance Library by the late J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps,  who has written, under date December 24, 1867, the following note: 'This  is a favourite book of mine. I like to read of London as it was, with  the bright Thames crowded with fish, and its picturesque  architecture. . . . I should not have discarded this volume for any  library, had I not this day picked up a beautiful _large paper_ copy of  it, the only one in that condition I ever saw or heard of.'    As an illustration of the enhanced value possessed by books having notes  written in them by their owners, it may be mentioned that when the great  Mr. Fox's furniture was sold by auction after his death in 1806, amongst  the books there happened to be the first volume of Gibbon's 'Decline and  Fall,' which apparently had been given by the author to Fox, who wrote  on the fly-leaf this note: 'The author at Brooks' said there was no  salvation for this country, until six heads of the principal persons in  the administration were laid on the table. Eleven days after, this same  gentleman accepted a place of \"lord of trade\" under those very  ministers, and has acted with them ever since.' This peculiarly nasty  little note sent the value of the odd volume up to L3 3s. Gibbon,  writing in his 'Autobiography' of Fox, says, 'I admired the powers of a  superior man, as they are blended in his attractive character with the  softness and simplicity of a child,' an opinion which he might have  modified if he had lived to read the foregoing note. When Canning's  books, for the most part of an exceedingly commonplace and uninteresting  character, came under the hammer at Christie's in 1828, the competition  was extremely keen for all volumes which bore the great statesman's  autograph, and as most of the books contained more or less elaborate  indications of Canning's proprietorship, his executors received nearly  double the sum which they could reasonably expect. Similar illustrations  occur every year at book-auctions.    The idiosyncrasies of collectors might make quite as long a chapter as  that of books which have belonged to famous persons, and it is for the  same reason that we have to deal briefly with each. It is curious that  almost as soon as book-collecting became at all general, the 'faddy' man  came into existence. Dr. John Webster, of Clitheroe, who died June 18,  1682, aged seventy-two, for example, had a library which was rich in  books of romance, and what was then termed 'the black art'; but Webster  was the author of a rare volume on witchcraft, so that his books were  his literary tools--just as, a century later, John Rennie, the  distinguished civil engineer, made a speciality of mathematical books,  of which he had a collection nearly complete in all languages. Dr.  Benjamin Moseley's library, which was sold by Stewart in March, 1814,  was composed for the most part of books on astrology, magic, and  facetiae. The Rev. F. J. Stainforth, whose library was sold at Sotheby's  in 1867, collected practically nothing but books written by or relating  to women; he aimed to secure not only every book, but every edition of  such books. He was a most determined book-hunter, and when Holywell  Street was at its lowest moral ebb, this eccentric gentleman used to  visit all the bookshops almost daily, his inquiry being, 'Have you any  women for me to-day?' Mr. Stainforth, who died in September, 1866, was  for many years curate of Camden Church, Camberwell, and was from 1851  incumbent of All Hallow's, Staining, the stipend of which was about  L560, and the population about 400. 'Bless my books--all my Bible books,  all my _hocus pocus_, and all my _leger-de-main_ books, and all my other  books, whether particularly mentioned at this time or not,' was the  prayer of a Scotsman of about a century and a quarter ago, and so  perhaps the Rev. Mr. Stainforth thought, if he did not utter  occasionally some such petition.[xxix-A]    Half a century ago one of the most inveterate frequenters of  book-auctions was a certain Dr. G., of diminutive stature, on account of  an awkward deviation of the spine. At that time the appearance of a  private purchaser at a sale was a very rare event, and one which, when  it occurred, invariably met with a more or less hostile reception from  the fraternity. Dr. G.'s first appearance produced a good deal of  sensation. The hunchback, it is true, was rather shabbily dressed, but  'l'habit ne fait pas le moine,' and is certainly no trustworthy index to  the pockets of the wearer. Excitement reached fever-heat when a Wynkyn  de Worde was put up and persistently contested for by the doctor, who  ran it up against the booksellers present (some of whom quickly desisted  from the fun for fear of burning their fingers), one of whom, far  exceeding his commission, obstinately refused to give in until the book  was knocked down to him to his own dismay, and the delight and ironical  compliments of his colleagues. After this _contretemps_ the doctor had  it pretty much his own way; his name was duly entered on the sale  catalogue, and his address was known. The next day our bookseller,  sobered by reflection, called on the doctor, confessed his sin of the  previous day, humbly asked for absolution, and offered him the book at  an immense loss on the sale price. 'If you were,' replied the doctor,  'to bring the book at my door for nothing, I would take it with a pair  of tongs and drop it into the gutter.' It was a puzzle to everyone what  the little doctor did with all his purchases, which were limited chiefly  to classical books. At his death, however, it transpired that he bought  for the various Universities of the United Kingdom. The doctor's son, a  poor curate, entered his late father's library for the first time, and  found there a mass of books, which occupied nearly a month in selling,  and realized, to his delight, a large sum of money.    The contempt with which Dr. G. received the bookseller's proposal is  peculiarly typical of the book-collector. If he cannot obtain what he  wants just exactly when he wants it, he does not care about it. The  book-collector is doubtless too prone to despise everything which is not  quite in his line, forgetting that all branches of literature contribute  in some degree, greater or lesser, to the bulk of human knowledge. No  man can be universal, even if he had the wealth of a dozen Rothschilds,  or the mental vigour and versatility of a hundred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#5)"],[1," and American novels are included, and  those only of the present century: also, that as to many which are  included, no imputation of immorality was made. Such a \"black list\" is  obviously open to the charge of doing great injustice to the good repute  of writers named, since only a part of the works written by some of them  can properly be objected to, and these are not specially named.  Bulwer-Lytton, for example, whose \"Paul Clifford\" is a very improper book  to go into the hands of young people, has written at least a dozen other  fictions of noble moral purpose, and high literary merit.    Out of seventy public libraries to which the list was sent, with inquiry  whether the authors named were admitted as books of circulation, thirty  libraries replied. All of them admitted Bulwer-Lytton and Wilkie Collins,  all but two Oliver Optic's books, and all but six Augusta Evans Wilson's.  Reynolds' novels were excluded by twenty libraries, Mrs. Southworth's by  eleven, \"Ouida's\" by nine, and Mrs. Stephens's and Mrs. Henry Wood's by  eight. Other details cannot find space for notice here.    This instance is one among many of endeavors constantly being made by  associated librarians to stem the ever increasing flood of poor fiction  which threatens to submerge the better class of books in our public  libraries.    That no such wholesome attempt can be wholly successful is evident  enough. The passion for reading fiction is both epidemic and chronic; and  in saying this, do not infer that I reckon it as a disease. A librarian  has no right to banish fiction because the appetite for it is abused. He  is not to set up any ideal and impossible standard of selection. His  most useful and beneficent function is to turn into better channels the  universal hunger for reading which is entertaining. Do readers want an  exciting novel? What can be more exciting than \"Les Miserables\" of Victor  Hugo, a book of exceptional literary excellence and power? Literature is  full of fascinating stories, admirably told, and there is no excuse for  loading our libraries with trash, going into the slums for models, or  feeding young minds upon the unclean brood of pessimistic novels. If it  is said that people will have trash, let them buy it, and let the  libraries wash their hands of it, and refuse to circulate the stuff which  no boy nor girl can touch without being contaminated.    Those who claim that we might as well let the libraries down to the level  of the poorest books, because unformed and ignorant minds are capable of  nothing better, should be told that people are never raised by giving  them nothing to look up to. To devour infinite trash is not the road to  learn wisdom, or virtue, or even to attain genuine amusement. To those  who are afraid that if the libraries are purified, the masses will get  nothing that they can read, the answer is, have they not got the entire  world of magazines, the weekly, daily, and Sunday newspapers, which  supply a whole library of fiction almost daily? Add to these plenty of  imaginative literature in fiction and in poetry, on every library's  shelves, which all who can read can comprehend, and what excuse remains  for buying what is neither decent nor improving?    Take an example of the boundless capacity for improvement that exists in  the human mind and human taste, from the spread of the fine arts among  the people. Thirty years ago, their houses, if having any decoration at  all, exhibited those fearful and wonderful colored lithographs and  chromos in which bad drawing, bad portraiture, and bad coloring vied with  each other to produce pictures which it would be a mild use of terms to  call detestable. Then came the two great international art expositions at  Philadelphia and Chicago, each greatly advancing by the finest models,  the standard of taste in art, and by new economies of reproduction  placing the most beautiful statues and pictures within the reach of the  most moderate purse. What has been the result? An incalculable  improvement in the public taste, educated by the diffusion of the best  models, until even the poor farmer of the backwoods will no longer  tolerate the cheap and nasty horrors that once disfigured his walls.    The lesson in art is good in literature also. Give the common people good  models, and there is no danger but they will appreciate and understand  them. Never stoop to pander to a depraved taste, no matter what specious  pleas you may hear for tolerating the low in order to lead to the high,  or for making your library contribute to the survival of the unfittest.    Is it asked, how can the librarian find out, among the world of novels  from which he is to select, what is pure and what is not, what is  wholesome and what unhealthy, what is improving and what is trash? The  answer is--there are some lists which will be most useful in this  discrimination, while there is no list which is infallible. Mr. F.  Leypoldt's little catalogue of \"Books for all Time\" has nothing that any  library need do without. Another compendious list is published by the  American Library Association. And the more extensive catalogue prepared  for the World's Fair in 1893, and embracing about 5,000 volumes, entitled  \"Catalogue of A. L. A. Library: 5,000 vols. for a popular library,\" while  it has many mistakes and omissions, is a tolerably safe guide in making  up a popular library. I may note that the list of novels in this large  catalogue put forth by the American Library Association has the names of  five only out of the twenty-eight writers of fiction heretofore  pronounced objectionable, and names a select few only of the books of  these five.    As for the later issues of the press, and especially the new novels, let  him skim them for himself, unless in cases where trustworthy critical  judgments are found in journals. Running through a book to test its style  and moral drift is no difficult task for the practiced eye.    Let us suppose that you are cursorily perusing a novel which has made a  great sensation, and you come upon the following sentence: \"Eighteen  millions of years would level all in one huge, common, shapeless ruin.  Perish the microcosm in the limitless macrocosm! and sink this feeble  earthly segregate in the boundless rushing choral aggregation!\" This is  in Augusta J. Evans Wilson's story \"Macaria\", and many equally  extraordinary examples of \"prose run mad\" are found in the novels of this  once noted writer. What kind of a model is that to form the style of the  youthful neophyte, to whom one book is as good as another, since it was  found on the shelves of the public library?    I am not insisting that all books admitted should be models of style;  even a purist must admit that one of the greatest charms of literature is  its infinite variety. But when book after book is filled with such  specimens of literary lunacy as this, one is tempted to believe that  Homer and Shakespeare, to say nothing of Thackeray and Hawthorne, have  lived in vain.    Never fear criticism of those who find fault with the absence from your  library of books that you know to be nearly worthless; their absence will  be a silent but eloquent protest against them, sure to be vindicated by  the utter oblivion into which they will fall. Many a flaming reputation  has been extinguished after dazzling callow admirers for six months, or  even less. Do not dread the empty sarcasm, that may grow out of the  exclusion of freshly printed trash, that your library is a \"back number.\"  To some poor souls every thing that is great and good in the world's  literature is a \"back number\"; and the Bible itself, with its immortal  poetry and sublimity, is the oldest back number of all. It is no part of  your business as a librarian to cater to the tastes of those who act as  if the reading of endless novels of sensation were the chief end of man.  As one fed on highly spiced viands and stimulating drinks surely loses  the appetite for wholesome and nourishing food, so one who reads only  exciting and highly wrought fictions loses the taste for the  master-pieces of prose and poetry.    Let not the fear of making many mistakes be a bug-bear in your path. If  you are told that your library is too exclusive, reply that it has not  means enough to buy all the good books that are wanted, and cannot afford  to spend money on bad or even on doubtful ones. If you have excluded any  highly-sought-for book on insufficient evidence, never fail to revise the  judgment. All that can be expected of any library is approximately just  and wise selection, having regard to merit, interest, and moral tone,  more than to novelty or popularity.    In the matter of choice, individual opinions are of small value. Never  buy a book simply because some reader extols it as very fine, or  \"splendid,\" or \"perfectly lovely.\" Such praises are commonly to be  distrusted in direct proportion to their extravagance.    A good lesson to libraries is furnished in the experience of the  Cleveland (Ohio) Public Library. In 1878, out of 16,000 volumes in that  library, no less than 6,000 were novels. The governing board, on the  plea of giving people what they wanted, bought nearly all new books of  fiction, and went so far, even, as to buy of Pinkerton's Detective  stories, fifteen copies each, fifteen of all Mrs. Southworth's novels,  etc. But a change took place in the board, and the librarian was  permitted to stop the growing flood of worthless fiction, and as fast as  the books were worn out, they were replaced by useful reading. It  resulted that four years later, with 40,000 volumes in the library, only  7,000 were novels, or less than one-fifth, instead of more than one-third  of the whole collection, as formerly. In the same time, the percentage of  fiction drawn out was reduced from 69 per cent. of the aggregate books  read, to 50 per cent.    Libraries are always complaining that they cannot buy many valuable"]]]
