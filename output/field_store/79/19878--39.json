One day he saw a little lithe black  body swimming rapidly at the surface, its head above the water. It was  about ten feet away from his lair, and headed up-stream. The strange  creature swam with legs, like a muskrat, instead of with fins like a  fish, but it was longer and slenderer than a muskrat; and something in  its sinister shape and motion, or else some stirring of an inherited  instinct, filled the big trout with apprehension as he looked.  Suddenly the stranger's head dipped under the surface, and the  stranger's eyes sought him out, far down in his yellow gloom. That  narrow-nosed, triangular head with its pointed fangs, those bright,  cruel, undeceivable eyes, smote the trout with instant alarm. Here was  an enemy to be avoided. The mink had dived at once, going through the  water with the swiftness and precision of a fish. Few trout could have  escaped. But the master of the pool, as we have seen, was no ordinary  trout. The promptness of his cunning had got him under way in time.  The power of his broad and muscular tail shot him forth from his lair  just before the mink got there. And before the baffled enemy could  change his direction, the trout was many feet away, heading up for the  broken water of the rapids. The mink followed vindictively, but in the  foamy stretch below the falls he lost all track of the fugitive. Angry  and disappointed he scrambled ashore, and, finding a dead sucker  beside his runway, seized it savagely. As he did so, there was a  smart click, and the jaws of a steel trap, snapping upon his throat,  rid the wilderness of one of its most bloodthirsty and implacable  marauders. A half-hour later the master of the pool was back in his  lair, waving his delicate, gay-coloured fins over the yellow sand, and  lazily swallowing a large crayfish. One claw of the crayfish projected  beyond his black jaw; and, being thus comfortably occupied, he turned  an indifferent eye upon the frightened swimming of a small green frog,  which had just then fallen in and disturbed the sheen of his amber  roof.    Very early one morning, when all his world was of a silvery gray, and  over the glassy pallor of his roof thin gleams of pink were mingled  with ghostly, swirling mist-shadows, a strange fly touched the  surface, directly above him. It had a slender, scarlet, curving body,  with long hairs of yellow and black about its neck, and brown and  white wings. It fell upon the water with the daintiest possible  splash, just enough to catch his attention. Being utterly unlike  anything he had ever seen before, it aroused his interest, and he  slanted slowly upward. A moment later a second fly touched the water,  a light gray, mottled thing, with a yellow body, and pink and green  hairs fringing its neck. This, too, was strange to him. He rolled a  foot higher, not with any immediate idea of trying them, but under his  usual vague impulse to investigate everything pertaining to his pool.  Just then the mist-swirls lifted slightly, and the light grew  stronger, and against the smooth surface he detected a fine, almost  invisible, thread leading from the head of each fly. With a derisive  flirt of his tail he sank back to the bottom of his lair. Right well  he knew the significance of that fine thread.    The strange flies skipped lightly over the surface of the pool, in a  manner that to most trout would have seemed very alluring. They moved  away toward a phenomenon which he just now noticed for the first time,  a pair of dark, pillar-like objects standing where the water was about  two feet deep, over toward the further shore. These dark objects moved  a little, gently. Then the strange flies disappeared. A moment later  they dropped again, and went through the same performance. This was  repeated several times, the big trout watching with interest mingled  with contempt. There was no peril for him in such gauds.    Presently the flies disappeared for good. A few minutes later two  others came in their place,--one a tiny, white, moth-like thing, the  other a big, bristling bunch of crimson hairs. The latter stirred,  far back in his dull memory, an association of pain and fear, and he  backed deeper into his watery den. It was a red hackle; and in his  early days, when he was about eight inches long and frequented the  tail of a shallow, foamy rapid, he had had experience of its sharp  allurements. The little moth he ignored, but he kept an eye on the red  hackle as it trailed and danced hither and thither across the pool.  Once, near the other side, he saw a misguided fingerling dart from  under a stone in the shallow water and seize the gay morsel. The  fingerling rose, with a jerk, from the water, and was no more seen. It  vanished into the unknown air; and the master of the pool quailed as  he marked its fate. After this, the pair of dark, pillar-like objects  moved away to the shore, no longer careful, but making a huge,  splashing noise. No more strange flies appeared; and the gold light of  full day stole down to the depths of the pool. Soon, flies which the  master well knew, with no fine threads attached to them, began to  speck the surface over him, and he fed, in his lazy way, without  misgiving.    The big trout had good reason for his dread of the angler's lure. His  experience with the red hackle had given him the wisdom which had  enabled him to live through all the perils of a well-known  trout-stream and grow to his present fame and stature. Behind that red  hackle which hooked him in his youth had been a good rod, a crafty  head, and a skilful wrist. His hour had sounded then and there, but  for a fortunate flaw in the tackle. The leader had parted just at the  drop, and the terrified trout (he had taken the tail fly) had darted  away frantically through the rapids with three feet of fine gut  trailing from his jaw. For several weeks he trailed that hampering  thread, and carried that red hackle in the cartilage of his upper jaw;  and he had time to get very familiar with them. He grew thin and  slab-sided under the fret of it before he succeeded, by much nosing in  gravel and sand, in wearing away the cartilage and rubbing his jaw  clear of the encumbrance. From that day forward he had scrutinized all  unfamiliar baits or lures to see if they carried any threadlike  attachment.    When any individual of the wild kindreds, furred, feathered, or  finned, achieves the distinction of baffling man's efforts to undo  him, his doom may be considered sealed. There is no beast, bird, or  fish so crafty or so powerful but some one man can worst him, and will  take the trouble to do it if the game seems to be worth while. Some  lure would doubtless have been found, some scheme devised for the  hiding of the line, whereby the big trout's cunning would have been  made foolishness. Some swimming frog, some terrified, hurrying mouse,  or some great night-moth flopping down upon the dim water of a  moonless night, would have lulled his suspicions and concealed the  inescapable barb; and the master of the pool would have gone to swell  the record of an ingenious conqueror. He would have been stuffed, and  mounted, and hung upon the walls of the club-house, down at the mouth  of the Clearwater. But it pleased the secret and inscrutable deities  of the woods that the end of the lordly trout should come in another  fashion.    It is an unusual thing, an unfortunate and pitiful thing, when death  comes to the wild kindred by the long-drawn, tragic way of  overripeness. When the powers begin to fail, the powers which enabled  them to conquer, or to flee from, or to outwit their innumerable  foes,--then life becomes a miserable thing for them. But that is not  for long. Fate meets them in the forest trails or the flowing  water-paths; and they have grown too dull to see, too heavy to flee,  too indifferent to contend. So they are spared the anguish of slow,  uncomprehending decrepitude.    But to the master of Golden Pool Fate came while he was yet master  unchallenged, and balked the hopes of many crafty fishermen. It came  in a manner not unworthy of the great trout's dignity and fame, giving  him over to swell no adversary's triumph, betraying him to no  contemptible foe.    One crisp autumn morning, when leaves were falling all over the  surface of the pool, and insects were few, and a fresh tang in the  water was making him active and hungry, the big trout was swimming  hither and thither about his domain instead of lying lazily in his  deep lair. He chanced to be over in the shallows near the grassy  shore, when he saw, at the upper end of the pool, a long, dark body  slip noiselessly into the water. It was not unlike the mink in form,  but several times larger. It swam with a swift movement of its  forefeet, while its hind legs, stretched out behind with the tail,  twisted powerfully, like a big sculling oar. Its method, indeed,  combined the advantages of that of the quadruped and that of the fish.  The trout saw at once that here was a foe to be dreaded, and he lay  quite still against a stone, trusting to escape the bright eyes of the  stranger.    But the stranger, as it happened, was hunting, and the stranger was an  otter. The big trout was just such quarry as he sought, and his bright  eyes, peering restlessly on every side, left no corner of the pool  uninvestigated. They caught sight of the master's silver and vermilion  sides, his softly waving, gay-coloured fins.    With a dart like that of the swiftest of fish, the stranger shot  across the pool. The trout darted madly toward his lair. The otter was  close upon him, missing him by a fin's breadth. Frantic now with  terror, the trout shot up-stream toward the broken water. But the  otter, driven not only by his forefeet but by that great combined  propeller of his hind legs and tail, working like a screw, swam  faster. Just at the edge of the broken water he overtook his prey.

We know how  closely analogous to 'darning' was the early weaving; and in our days  it is not unusual to find stockings not darned at right angles, and it  may be the women weavers of old sometimes put in the weft more or less  out of true right angle. In the childhood of weaving we should expect  different methods, and it may be, seeing that we have no selvedged  cloth until very long after this time, that they experimented with a  diagonal weft to see if it would not reduce the tendency to fray out  at the sides.\" The amount the warp and weft are out of the right angle  is stated to be about 20 deg. The specimen shown me under the microscope  indicated clearly that the warp and weft were not at right angles and  that the interstices were not square but diamond shaped.    It is possible to arrange the warp threads diagonally from beam to  beam, but with continuous weft (that is in weaving so as to get  selvedges) the weft has the tendency to slip up on one side and down  on the other, hence the weaving is made laborious. With a separate  weft for each pick, _i.e._, for every once the shed is opened, there  is naturally not this tendency, but this alleged diagonally woven  cloth frays just as easily as any other piece of cloth without  selvedge, so in either case there is not only no advantage but  distinct disadvantage taking the diagonal \"beaming\" into  consideration. We must give the Egyptians credit for using the least  laborious of two methods, that is _if_ the second one were known to  them.    Apparent diagonal weaving can be produced by anyone taking an ordinary  piece of linen or cotton cloth, cutting off the selvedge and  stretching the cloth in a direction diagonally to the direction of the  warp and weft, and a piece of diagonally woven cloth is the result!    The probability is that the specimen of cloth, without a selvedge,  having been stretched over the body for a long period of time, has, in  the course of that time lost its nature and when removed it has  retained its altered form and gives us the impression of having been  woven diagonally.      \"THE LINEN GIRDLE OF RAMESES III.\"    In the foregoing I have shown how extremely simple was the whole  apparatus for weaving in use by the Ancient Egyptians, and one is  rather surprised to be told that about B.C. 1200, in the time of  Rameses III., the Egyptians \"built and used looms very much more  complicated than has hitherto been believed to be the case,\" or to be  referred to \"the really complicated form of loom used.\" Yet this is  what Mr. Thorold D. Lee tells us (pp. 84 and 86) in his paper on _The  Linen Girdle of Rameses III._ (_Ann. of Archaeology and Anthropology of  the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology_, July, 1912, V.)    The characteristics of this girdle are its great length, 17 feet (5 m.  2), its even taper diminishing from 5 in. (12.7 cm.) in width to 1-7/8  in. (4.8 cm.) in width, its elaborate design and excellent  workmanship. Perhaps the chief of these characteristics is the taper.  It is most probable, as Mr. Lee points out, that in the weaving the  warp threads have been gradually dropped out to make the taper, rather  than that additional warp threads have been added. As it is easy to  drop a warp thread, and almost impossible to add one while weaving is  in progress, Mr. Lee's view is confirmed by this. It would also be  almost impossible to keep the warp taut if the number of warp threads  were increased as the work went on. This means that the girdle was  commenced at the wide end and finished at the narrow end.    It is common knowledge that when a warp thread drops out, its place is  indicated by a thinness or fine opening for the whole length of the  missing warp, and this is so because the reed, besides pushing the  weft into position, also acts as a warp spacer, that is to say it  keeps the warp threads properly apart, every one being properly  aligned. When no reed is used the warp threads are not so evenly  placed--they are not so parallel to one another for there is nothing  but their tautness to keep them in position. Hence there is every  reason to conclude that when, on a loom provided with a reed, warp  threads have been removed their position must be indicated, and _vice  versa_ if no reed has been used the position of the removed threads  will not be so clearly indicated, but there will be a more marked  shrinkage in the width of the cloth as well as in the pattern, and  this is what has taken place in the girdle giving us the diminishing  taper.    [Illustration: \"THE LINEN GIRDLE OF RAMESES III.\"    _Reproduced by kind permission of Dr. Clubb, Director, The Museums,  Liverpool._]    If this diminishing taper were indicated by a decrease in the width of  the pattern commencing at the selvedges, then it might be presumed  that a reed had been used for the central portion only--a very clumsy  even if feasible arrangement, but the pattern begins to decrease along  the middle and hence no reed could have been used.    It does not follow that because a loom was not provided with a reed it  was without heddles. Anyone who will examine the large series of  primitive looms at Bankfield Museum, will observe that heddles  preceded reeds; this must necessarily be so as the making of the shed  is the first step in weaving, while the reed's work is more that of a  finisher. But the heddles are all extremely primitive, and in my  experience do not exceed four in number where there is no reed. Such a  quantity of heddles with its complicated harness as Mr. Lee considers  necessary is quite out of the question with a loom so undeveloped as  not to be provided with a reed. Hence the indication is that the  girdle was woven on a loom of a primitive character.    In carrying out the work the weaver has made many mistakes. On the  left hand side of the right hand row of red crosses (they come out  black in the photograph) there is an \"end down\" for a considerable  distance--that is a thread has been missed.    On the same row of crosses three white threads show above and below,  while on the left hand row of crosses there are five white threads  above and below. The crosses are neither the same size nor shape in  the two columns and curiously their white hafts in both columns point  to the left instead of one row pointing to the left and the other to  the right. Then again the white point at the right apex of the zigzag  on the left corresponds to a red point at the left apex of the right  hand zigzag, but if the girdle had been woven on an advanced loom with  dobby and harness these points would have been red in both places.    As regards the large number of warp threads to the inch which Mr. Lee  puts down as 272-340 (107-134 per cm.), this does not by any means  indicate a complicated piece of machinery for the weaving of this belt  or any other fabric. The greater the number of threads to the inch the  finer must the threads be in order to get them into the allotted  space, and in the weaving there will be so many more threads to raise  and lower in order to make the shed opening. It means multiplying the  work but does not necessarily mean that a more complicated loom must  be used in the weaving.    It is not possible without opening the fabric to be quite positive on  the many points which are raised, but there seems nothing about it  which should prevent its having been made on a simple loom. Although  superior to most, but not all, of the well known Coptic cloths in  Bankfield and in many other museums, it very closely resembles some of  them in many respects excepting in the taper.    I should add that in making my examination of this girdle I was kindly  assisted by Mr. C. A. Trigg, a well known Halifax mill manager and  designer. We made the examination independently and on comparing notes  afterwards found that we agreed in all essential points.      AN EXAMINATION OF FIFTEEN SPECIMENS OF MUMMY WRAPPINGS.    By W. W. MIDGLEY, Curator, retired, The Museums, Bolton.    \"So far back as 1834, Mummy cloths occupied the attention of James  Thompson, F.R.S., who, after researches into their characteristics and  structure wrote a paper on the subject, which appears in the London  and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, Vol. V., page 355. From that  time until quite recently, little additional knowledge on the subject  has appeared. In the early part of 1910, Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie,  F.R.S., expressed a desire that the writer should undertake  microscopic investigation of the body-wrappings of cloths of the III.  and early IV. Dynasties (_circa_ 2980-2750 B.C.) which he had brought  home from excavations made at a cemetery near Meydum, Upper Egypt. The  report upon them forms part of the \"_Historical Studies_,\" Vol. II.,  of the _British School of Archaeology in Egypt_.    When Mr. Ling Roth suggested that some of the examples of Egyptian  Mummy cloths in Bankfield Museum should be examined on similar lines,  describing the construction of the fabrics and yarns, together with  the characteristics of the fibres used, I undertook to carry out the  work and forward to him the results for permanent reference.    Each of the fifteen cloths submitted was first examined by mounting  about 3/4\" x 5/8\" (20 mm. x 16 mm.) of the cloth on 3\" x 1\" (76 mm. x  25 mm.) glass slips, and covering with thin glass, so as to find out  its plan of composition and the number of warp and weft threads per  linear inch. Afterwards, a little of the warp threads as well as of  the weft, was untwisted and the fibres separated, and these mounted  apart on another 3\" x 1\" slip (76 x 25 mm.), so that the kind of  textile fibre used and the diameter of the fibres could be measured.  These microscopical preparations will be kept in Bankfield Museum, as  they may be of interest to microscopists in the locality.    The cloths are from three sources:--Nos. 1 and 2 being from the  private collection of Dr. Wallis-Budge, who has"]]]
