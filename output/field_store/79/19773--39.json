Thus the  census of 1890 shows, in the Northwest, many counties in which there is  an absolute or a relative decrease of population. These States have been  sending farmers to advance the frontier on the plains, and have  themselves begun to turn to intensive farming and to manufacture. A  decade before this, Ohio had shown the same transition stage. Thus the  demand for land and the love of wilderness freedom drew the frontier  ever onward.    Having now roughly outlined the various kinds of frontiers, and their  modes of advance, chiefly from the point of view of the frontier itself,  we may next inquire what were the influences on the East and on the Old  World. A rapid enumeration of some of the more noteworthy effects is all  that I have time for.    First, we note that the frontier promoted the formation of a composite  nationality for the American people. The coast was preponderantly  English, but the later tides of continental immigration flowed across to  the free lands. This was the case from the early colonial days. The  Scotch-Irish and the Palatine Germans, or \"Pennsylvania Dutch,\"  furnished the dominant element in the stock of the colonial frontier.  With these peoples were also the freed indented servants, or  redemptioners, who at the expiration of their time of service passed to  the frontier. Governor Spotswood of Virginia writes in 1717, \"The  inhabitants of our frontiers are composed generally of such as have been  transported hither as servants, and, being out of their time, settle  themselves where land is to be taken up and that will produce the  necessarys of life with little labour.\"[22:1] Very generally these  redemptioners were of non-English stock. In the crucible of the  frontier the immigrants were Americanized, liberated, and fused into a  mixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics. The  process has gone on from the early days to our own. Burke and other  writers in the middle of the eighteenth century believed that  Pennsylvania[23:1] was \"threatened with the danger of being wholly  foreign in language, manners, and perhaps even inclinations.\" The German  and Scotch-Irish elements in the frontier of the South were only less  great. In the middle of the present century the German element in  Wisconsin was already so considerable that leading publicists looked to  the creation of a German state out of the commonwealth by concentrating  their colonization.[23:2] Such examples teach us to beware of  misinterpreting the fact that there is a common English speech in  America into a belief that the stock is also English.    In another way the advance of the frontier decreased our dependence on  England. The coast, particularly of the South, lacked diversified  industries, and was dependent on England for the bulk of its supplies.  In the South there was even a dependence on the Northern colonies for  articles of food. Governor Glenn, of South Carolina, writes in the  middle of the eighteenth century: \"Our trade with New York and  Philadelphia was of this sort, draining us of all the little money and  bills we could gather from other places for their bread, flour, beer,  hams, bacon, and other things of their produce, all which, except beer,  our new townships begin to supply us with, which are settled with very  industrious and thriving Germans. This no doubt diminishes the number of  shipping and the appearance of our trade, but it is far from being a  detriment to us.\"[23:3]    Before long the frontier created a demand for merchants. As it  retreated from the coast it became less and less possible for England to  bring her supplies directly to the consumer's wharfs, and carry away  staple crops, and staple crops began to give way to diversified  agriculture for a time. The effect of this phase of the frontier action  upon the northern section is perceived when we realize how the advance  of the frontier aroused seaboard cities like Boston, New York, and  Baltimore, to engage in rivalry for what Washington called \"the  extensive and valuable trade of a rising empire.\"    The legislation which most developed the powers of the national  government, and played the largest part in its activity, was conditioned  on the frontier. Writers have discussed the subjects of tariff, land,  and internal improvement, as subsidiary to the slavery question. But  when American history comes to be rightly viewed it will be seen that  the slavery question is an incident. In the period from the end of the  first half of the present century to the close of the Civil War slavery  rose to primary, but far from exclusive, importance. But this does not  justify Dr. von Holst (to take an example) in treating our  constitutional history in its formative period down to 1828 in a single  volume, giving six volumes chiefly to the history of slavery from 1828  to 1861, under the title \"Constitutional History of the United States.\"  The growth of nationalism and the evolution of American political  institutions were dependent on the advance of the frontier. Even so  recent a writer as Rhodes, in his \"History of the United States since  the Compromise of 1850,\" has treated the legislation called out by the  western advance as incidental to the slavery struggle.    This is a wrong perspective. The pioneer needed the goods of the coast,  and so the grand series of internal improvement and railroad legislation  began, with potent nationalizing effects. Over internal improvements  occurred great debates, in which grave constitutional questions were  discussed. Sectional groupings appear in the votes, profoundly  significant for the historian. Loose construction increased as the  nation marched westward.[25:1] But the West was not content with  bringing the farm to the factory. Under the lead of Clay--\"Harry of the  West\"--protective tariffs were passed, with the cry of bringing the  factory to the farm. The disposition of the public lands was a third  important subject of national legislation influenced by the frontier.    The public domain has been a force of profound importance in the  nationalization and development of the government. The effects of the  struggle of the landed and the landless States, and of the Ordinance of  1787, need no discussion.[25:2] Administratively the frontier called out  some of the highest and most vitalizing activities of the general  government. The purchase of Louisiana was perhaps the constitutional  turning point in the history of the Republic, inasmuch as it afforded  both a new area for national legislation and the occasion of the  downfall of the policy of strict construction. But the purchase of  Louisiana was called out by frontier needs and demands. As frontier  States accrued to the Union the national power grew. In a speech on the  dedication of the Calhoun monument Mr. Lamar explained: \"In 1789 the  States were the creators of the Federal Government; in 1861 the Federal  Government was the creator of a large majority of the States.\"    When we consider the public domain from the point of view of the sale  and disposal of the public lands we are again brought face to face with  the frontier. The policy of the United States in dealing with its lands  is in sharp contrast with the European system of scientific  administration. Efforts to make this domain a source of revenue, and to  withhold it from emigrants in order that settlement might be compact,  were in vain. The jealousy and the fears of the East were powerless in  the face of the demands of the frontiersmen. John Quincy Adams was  obliged to confess: \"My own system of administration, which was to make  the national domain the inexhaustible fund for progressive and unceasing  internal improvement, has failed.\" The reason is obvious; a system of  administration was not what the West demanded; it wanted land. Adams  states the situation as follows: \"The slaveholders of the South have  bought the cooperation of the western country by the bribe of the  western lands, abandoning to the new Western States their own proportion  of the public property and aiding them in the design of grasping all the  lands into their own hands.\" Thomas H. Benton was the author of this  system, which he brought forward as a substitute for the American system  of Mr. Clay, and to supplant him as the leading statesman of the West.  Mr. Clay, by his tariff compromise with Mr. Calhoun, abandoned his own  American system. At the same time he brought forward a plan for  distributing among all the States of the Union the proceeds of the sales  of the public lands. His bill for that purpose passed both Houses of  Congress, but was vetoed by President Jackson, who, in his annual  message of December, 1832, formally recommended that all public lands  should be gratuitously given away to individual adventurers and to the  States in which the lands are situated.[26:1]    \"No subject,\" said Henry Clay, \"which has presented itself to the  present, or perhaps any preceding, Congress, is of greater magnitude  than that of the public lands.\" When we consider the far-reaching  effects of the government's land policy upon political, economic, and  social aspects of American life, we are disposed to agree with him. But  this legislation was framed under frontier influences, and under the  lead of Western statesmen like Benton and Jackson. Said Senator Scott of  Indiana in 1841: \"I consider the preemption law merely declaratory of  the custom or common law of the settlers.\"    It is safe to say that the legislation with regard to land, tariff, and  internal improvements--the American system of the nationalizing Whig  party--was conditioned on frontier ideas and needs. But it was not  merely in legislative action that the frontier worked against the  sectionalism"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/230"],[0,"The Bucolics and Eclogues (#5)"],[1,"me.

May we believe it, or are lovers still  By their own fancies fooled?

MOERIS                                  O Lycidas,  We have lived to see, what never yet we feared,  An interloper own our little farm,  And say, \"Be off, you former husbandmen!  These fields are mine.\" Now, cowed and out of heart,  Since Fortune turns the whole world upside down,  We are taking him- ill luck go with the same!-'  These kids you see.    LYCIDAS                          But surely I had heard  That where the hills first draw from off the plain,  And the high ridge with gentle slope descends,  Down to the brook-side and the broken crests  Of yonder veteran beeches, all the land  Was by the songs of your Menalcas saved.    MOERIS  Heard it you had, and so the rumour ran,  But 'mid the clash of arms, my Lycidas,  Our songs avail no more than, as 'tis said,  Doves of Dodona when an eagle comes.  Nay, had I not, from hollow ilex-bole  Warned by a raven on the left, cut short  The rising feud, nor I, your Moeris here,  No, nor Menalcas, were alive to-day.    LYCIDAS  Alack! could any of so foul a crime  Be guilty? Ah! how nearly, thyself,  Reft was the solace that we had in thee,  Menalcas! Who then of the Nymphs had sung,  Or who with flowering herbs bestrewn the ground,  And o'er the fountains drawn a leafy veil?-  Who sung the stave I filched from you that day  To Amaryllis wending, our hearts' joy?-  \"While I am gone, 'tis but a little way,  Feed, Tityrus, my goats, and, having fed,  Drive to the drinking-pool, and, as you drive,  Beware the he-goat; with his horn he butts.\"    MOERIS  Ay, or to Varus that half-finished lay,  \"Varus, thy name, so still our Mantua live-  Mantua to poor Cremona all too near-  Shall singing swans bear upward to the stars.\"    LYCIDAS  So may your swarms Cyrnean yew-trees shun,  Your kine with cytisus their udders swell,  Begin, if aught you have. The Muses made  Me too a singer; I too have sung; the swains  Call me a poet, but I believe them not:  For naught of mine, or worthy Varius yet  Or Cinna deem I, but account myself  A cackling goose among melodious swans.    MOERIS  'Twas in my thought to do so, Lycidas;  Even now was I revolving silently  If this I could recall- no paltry song:  \"Come, Galatea, what pleasure is 't to play  Amid the waves? Here glows the Spring, here earth  Beside the streams pours forth a thousand flowers;  Here the white poplar bends above the cave,  And the lithe vine weaves shadowy covert: come,  Leave the mad waves to beat upon the shore.\"    LYCIDAS  What of the strain I heard you singing once  On a clear night alone? the notes I still  Remember, could I but recall the words.    MOERIS  \"Why, Daphnis, upward gazing, do you mark  The ancient risings of the Signs? for look  Where Dionean Caesar's star comes forth  In heaven, to gladden all the fields with corn,  And to the grape upon the sunny slopes  Her colour bring! Now, the pears;  So shall your children's children pluck their fruit.    Time carries all things, even our wits, away.  Oft, as a boy, I sang the sun to rest,  But all those songs are from my memory fled,  And even his voice is failing Moeris now;  The wolves eyed Moeris first: but at your wish  Menalcas will repeat them oft enow.    LYCIDAS  Your pleas but linger out my heart's desire:  Now all the deep is into silence hushed,  And all the murmuring breezes sunk to sleep.  We are half-way thither, for Bianor's tomb  Begins to show: here, Moeris, where the hinds  Are lopping the thick leafage, let us sing.  Set down the kids, yet shall we reach the town;  Or, if we fear the night may gather rain  Ere we arrive, then singing let us go,  Our way to lighten; and, that we may thus  Go singing, I will case you of this load.    MOERIS  Cease, boy, and get we to the work in hand:  We shall sing better when himself is come.          ECLOGUE X    GALLUS    This now, the very latest of my toils,  Vouchsafe me, Arethusa! needs must I  Sing a brief song to Gallus- brief, but yet  Such as Lycoris' self may fitly read.  Who would not sing for Gallus? So, when thou  Beneath Sicanian billows glidest on,  May Doris blend no bitter wave with thine,  Begin! The love of Gallus be our theme,  And the shrewd pangs he suffered, while, hard by,  The flat-nosed she-goats browse the tender brush.  We sing not to deaf ears; no word of ours  But the woods echo it. What groves or lawns  Held you, ye Dryad-maidens, when for love-  Love all unworthy of a loss so dear-  Gallus lay dying? for neither did the slopes  Of Pindus or Parnassus stay you then,  No, nor Aonian Aganippe. Him  Even the laurels and the tamarisks wept;  For him, outstretched beneath a lonely rock,  Wept pine-clad Maenalus, and the flinty crags  Of cold Lycaeus. The sheep too stood around-  Of us they feel no shame, poet divine;  Nor of the flock be thou ashamed: even fair  Adonis by the rivers fed his sheep-  Came shepherd too, and swine-herd footing slow,  And, from the winter-acorns dripping-wet  Menalcas. All with one accord exclaim:  \"From whence this love of thine?\" Apollo came;  \"Gallus, art mad?\" he cried, \"thy bosom's care  Another love is following.\"Therewithal  Silvanus came, with rural honours crowned;  The flowering fennels and tall lilies shook  Before him. Yea, and our own eyes beheld  Pan, god of Arcady, with blood-red juice  Of the elder-berry, and with vermilion, dyed.  \"Wilt ever make an end?\" quoth he, \"behold  Love recks not aught of it: his heart no more  With tears is sated than with streams the grass,  Bees with the cytisus, or goats with leaves.\"  \"Yet will ye sing, Arcadians, of my woes  Upon your mountains,\" sadly he replied-  \"Arcadians, that alone have skill to sing.  O then how softly would my ashes rest,  If of my love, one day, your flutes should tell!  And would that I, of your own fellowship,  Or dresser of the ripening grape had been,  Or guardian of the flock! for surely then,  Let Phyllis, or Amyntas, or who else,  Bewitch me- what if swart Amyntas be?  Dark is the violet, dark the hyacinth-  Among the willows, 'neath the limber vine,  Reclining would my love have lain with me,  Phyllis plucked garlands, or Amyntas sung.  Here are cool springs, soft mead and grove, Lycoris;  Here might our lives with time have worn away.  But me mad love of the stern war-god holds  Armed amid weapons and opposing foes.  Whilst thou- Ah! might I but believe it not!-  Alone without me, and from home afar,  Look'st upon Alpine snows and frozen Rhine.  Ah! may the frost not hurt thee, may the sharp  And jagged ice not wound thy tender feet!  I will depart, re-tune the songs I framed  In verse Chalcidian to the oaten reed  Of the Sicilian swain. Resolved am I  In the woods, rather, with wild beasts to couch,  And bear my doom, and character my love  Upon the tender tree-trunks: they will grow,  And you, my love, grow with them. And meanwhile  I with the Nymphs will haunt Mount Maenalus,  Or hunt the keen wild boar. No frost so cold  But I will hem with hounds thy forest-glades,  Parthenius. Even now, methinks, I range  O'er rocks, through echoing groves, and joy to launch  Cydonian arrows from a Parthian bow.-  As if my madness could find healing thus,  Or that god soften at a mortal's grief!  Now neither Hamadryads, no, nor songs  Delight me more: ye woods, away with you!  No pangs of ours can change him; not though we  In the mid-frost should drink of Hebrus' stream,  And in wet winters face Sithonian snows,  Or, when the bark of the tall elm-tree bole  Of drought is dying, should, under Cancer's Sign,  In Aethiopian deserts drive our flocks.  Love conquers all things; yield we too to love!\"    These songs, Pierian Maids, shall it suffice  Your poet to have sung, the while he sat,  And of slim mallow wove a basket fine:  To Gallus ye will magnify their worth,  Gallus, for whom my love grows hour by hour,  As the green alder shoots in early Spring.  Come, let us rise: the shade is wont to be  Baneful to singers; baneful is the shade  Cast by the juniper, crops sicken too  In shade. Now homeward, having fed your fill--  Eve's star is rising-go, my she-goats, go."]]]
