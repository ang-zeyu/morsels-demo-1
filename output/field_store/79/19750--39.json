An acquaintance once said to me that he would  \"_never buy another book_,\" because he had been \"buncoed\" by a  book-agent, to whom he otherwise referred with an uncomplimentary  adjective. But this did not convince me that his position was more  logical than that of the man who declared he would never take another  bath because a watch had been stolen from his pocket while he was in  bathing at some beach resort. It is incomprehensible that any one  could imagine that our paper currency system is fraudulent because  there are a few \"green-goods\" men in the country, or because  counterfeit bills appear every now and then.    We read so much in the papers nowadays of the extravagant sums paid  for rare books by our modern millionaire bibliomaniacs that one is apt  to become somewhat panic-stricken upon experiencing the first symptoms  of the bibliomania. While these more opulent victims of book-madness  vie with one another in the auction-room, the rational bibliophile  sits in the gallery and views with silent awe and amazement the  scrimmage over some apparently trifling volume that wouldn't fetch ten  cents, but for the fact that it is \"unique,\" and that so and so paid a  stupendous sum for it at some previous sale. Despair not, dear  bibliophile, of never being able to join in the mad scramble for these  \"uniques;\" nor need you feel that they are essential to the formation  of a library. They possess no virtues perceptible to the ordinary  bibliophile, and it requires all the eloquence of a Cicero to  elucidate their charms when displaying them to friends. For after all,  the chief point of interest in such books is their cost price, and  this you may be obliged to refrain from mentioning for fear you will  be accused of being mentally unbalanced.    It is not necessary to squander a fortune in collecting a library,  nor to be hasty in buying every book you come across. Better go slowly  and select wisely; you will derive more enjoyment from it, and in  later years have less to charge to \"experience account.\"    There are a few \"busy\" book-collectors who intrust the selection of  their books to secretaries or librarians, and thus sacrifice the  keenest enjoyment of this captivating pursuit. Of all absurdities,  this seems the most insupportable. It would be far more sensible to  have your secretary select your friends, because if you should happen  not to like these, you could abandon them without ceremony or expense.  Why not also attend the opera and your various social functions by  proxy, through your secretary? If he were as good a courtier as he is  \"literary adviser,\" he might succeed in getting as much enjoyment out  of the receptions and dinners as you would, if you were to attend in  person. Then, think of the _time_ you would save! We frequently hear  the remark: \"I have no time to devote to my library. I am very fond of  books, but haven't time to collect or read them.\" And yet seeing what  may be done in this regard by care and system, and that the greatest  readers have been the busiest men, it seems strange that persons of  intelligence should thus express themselves; should admit such obvious  fatuity of view and procedure.    In referring to this class of book-buyers, Roswell Field says, \"The  book-lover, so-called, who lacks any of the thrills that go with the  _establishment_ as well as the enjoyment of a library in all of its  appointments has deprived himself of many of the most pleasurable  literary and semi-literary emotions. That bibliophile never pats his  horse or his dog. To him his books are merely tools of trade,  accessories to knowledge, to be pawed over, thrown away and replaced  by new copies when worn out. He glories in the fact that his books are  his servants rather than his companions, and he affects to despise and  laugh at the sentimental relation which others have established with  their books. Look out for that man! He is not of us; he is not of the  elect; there is as little of warmth and the genial glow of fellowship  in his library as in the middle gallery of the catacombs in the Appian  Way. His very books cry out against him; but he hears them not, for he  is deaf as well as blind.\"    One of the busiest men in New York City, whose name is familiar in  financial circles throughout the civilized world, is one of the most  voracious collectors of the age. He probably transacts more business  in a day than half a dozen ordinarily busy men, and yet finds time to  give his personal attention to every minute detail of his vast  collections, to which are added hundreds, and probably thousands, of  items every year. This is only one of many such examples among our  busiest men.    I have often heard persons lament in a pensive and apologetic sort of  way, \"Yes, I have a great weakness for fine books.\" The very presence  of this mis-called weakness, however, is unmistakable proof of great  mental strength, and those who suffer from it may find solace in the  fact that the giants of commerce, leading statesmen, and great men of  affairs in general are frequently thus afflicted all through the  periods of their greatest activity and success. What can possibly  afford a more agreeable relaxation from the toils and perplexities of  the day than to recline in an easy chair before an open grate fire in  the library, surrounded by the silently reposing tomes which record  and preserve the noblest thoughts of past and present generations?  Surely no enjoyment in the home or office can be more delectable and  unfailing in assuaging the worry and solicitude of a strenuous life  than the silent companionship of books. It is a noteworthy fact that a  large percentage of the leading stock brokers, bankers, active  statesmen, and sedulous lawyers are bibliophiles. I attribute this to  the fact that all of these vocations are extremely taxing upon the  nervous system, and those men who are busily engaged in them are,  during the intermittent hours of rest and recreation, naturally  inclined to seek the most enjoyable and refreshing diversions; for, as  Horace says,--        . . . nunc veterum libris, nunc somno et inertibus horis      Ducere sollicitae jocunda oblivia vitae.        Along with old books, or a nap, and divine hours of leisure--      To taste thus forgetfulness--sweet, in the midst of life's troubles.    In an article written for The Bibliophile Society's (1903) Year  Book, Caroline Ticknor says, \"The true book-lover loves his books for  their helpfulness, for their companionship; but he regards them as  well for their elegant settings.\" She also observes that \"strange as  the anomaly may seem, there are still many persons of ample means, and  some education, who, although they would be horrified at the very  thought of admitting to the home a cheap rug or vase, to destroy the  harmony and bring discord and confusion into the luxuriance of the  furnishings, yet will nonchalantly tolerate the incongruity of a  miserable fragment of a library made up of the cheapest and meanest  editions to be found in the market, such as would be scorned by those  of the most limited means and plebeian tastes. These will be found  inappropriately housed amid the most sumptuous surroundings. A single  rug to adorn the floor, or a single vase resting on a mantle, will  often be found to have cost ten times as much as the whole home  library. And yet the intellects of these people have been nurtured and  trained in their youth by the brilliant thoughts of ancient and modern  writers! Even the favorite author, be it Shakespeare, Dickens,  Longfellow, Tennyson, or some other, is frequently represented by a  half dozen or so disconsolate-looking volumes, the remainder of the  set either never having been bought, or else, if bought, thrown aside,  or strewn around the attic, or abandoned as a child would discard a  toy which afforded it no further amusement.    \"It is worthy of remark, however, that the enormously increased  demand of late for beautiful books evinces the fact that cultured and  wealthy people are growing to appreciate the importance not only of  having a good library, but that its quality should embody a degree of  estheticism to correspond with the surroundings.\"    Many of the most delightful persons, well read and competent to  discourse intelligently upon the merits of books and authors, have  never experienced a single pulsation of true bibliophilism; they have  never known the joy of possessing and admiring a beautiful book, and  that the attachment one bears for such a treasure is wholly  reciprocal. They have not learned that fine books, like human beings,  are capable of mutual affection, and that it is not necessary to  devour them in order to value their charms. \"We do not gather books to  read them, my Boeotian friend,\" says Mr. Joline; \"the idea is a  childish delusion. 'In early life,' says Walter Bagehot, 'there is an  opinion that the obvious thing to do with a horse is to ride it; with  a cake, to eat it; with a sixpence to spend it.' A few boyish persons  carry this further, and think that the natural thing to do with a book  is to read it. The mere reading of a rare book is a puerility, an  idiosyncrasy of adolescence; it is the _ownership_ of the book which  is the matter of distinction. The collector of coins does not  accumulate his treasures for the purpose of ultimately spending them"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#5)"],[1," as an important element of their  attractiveness to eye and hand. Whoever would learn what an enormous  difference in esthetic effect can be produced by slight differences in  style and size, especially in thickness, should compare the Pickering  \"Aldines\" with the rival set of British Poets published by Little and  Brown. The latter series is a noble one, often showing better presswork  than Pickering's, and it was deservedly popular, but it is many degrees  removed from the totality of esthetic charm that would entitle it to  rank as a favorite.    We said that Pickering went back to Aldus for his model, but he did not  travel a lonely road. The book size in question had never ceased to be  used, and in the eighteenth century it was in full favor. The writings  of the novelists and essayists found ready buyers in this form, as  witness, among others, the Strahan Fielding of 1783, the Rivington Idler  of the same year, and the Rivington Sterne of 1788. The size of the  printed page is usually larger, but that of the Sterne corresponds as  closely to that of the two \"Aldines\" as the difference in the size of  type will permit. Pickering's contemporaries and successors in the  publishing field recognized the attractiveness of this book size, and  the works of the poets generally were issued in this form; hence we  have, for example, the Longman Southey, the Moxon Wordsworth, and the  Murray Crabbe. The latest series to appeal for popular favor by the use  of this book form is Everyman's Library, in which, though much has been  sacrificed to cheapness, the outward proportions of the volumes are  almost identical with those adopted by Aldus and Pickering.        Go, little book, whose pages hold        Those garnered years in loving trust;      How long before your blue and gold        Shall fade and whiten in the dust?    This stanza from Dr. Holmes's introduction to his \"Poems\" of 1862 may  well be claimed by the Blue and Gold edition of the poets as its  passport to the recognition of future generations. But it will need no  passport; its own enduring charm is sufficient. The volumes of this  dainty series, while larger in all but thickness than the \"Elzevirs,\"  yet make their appeal by much the same qualities, compactness and  portability, with a suggestion of the Elzevirian plumpness. To the  attraction of the size is added the contrasted charm of the blue cover  and the gilt stamp and edges. That a Blue and Gold edition, in the  absence of its name qualities, becomes something far inferior may be  seen from a copy that has lost them in rebinding. In spite of the  hardness of their blue and the crudeness of their stamped designs, these  little volumes attract every reader and never remain long on the shelves  of the second-hand bookstores. We should not expect a publisher to  succeed were he now to put them upon the market for the first time or in  an exact reproduction. But the publisher who shall so recombine their  elements as to produce upon his public the effect which they made upon  theirs, and which they still make as reminiscent of an earlier taste,  will be the envy of his fellows. It is interesting to note that after  fifty years these volumes show no sign of fading, so that Dr. Holmes  might well have made his stanza an exclamation instead of a question.  They seem likely to last as long as the \"Elzevirs\" or even the \"Alduses\"  have already lasted, and possibly to outlast the fame, though hardly the  memory, of the poet who sang them. The dimensions of the cover are 5-5/8  by 3-3/8 inches; the thickness is about an inch. There was a larger Blue  and Gold format, as well as several smaller, but only the standard is  now valued.    We cannot bring our list of favorite book sizes much nearer the present  without running the risk of confusing the temporary and the permanent in  popular approval. We will, therefore, close with a mention of the Little  Classics. At about the time when the Blue and Gold series ceased to be  published, more exactly in 1874, Mr. Rossiter Johnson designed for the  now famous series which he was then editing a book form that sprang at  once into a favor that it still retains. In this form, which appears to  have no near counterpart in either earlier or later bookmaking, the  volumes are closely six by four inches by three-quarters of an inch in  thickness. The edges are colored red, whatever the color of the sides.  The printed page is relatively wide, and the whole effect of the book is  that of a tiny quarto, though in reality the dimensions are those of a  rather small sixteenmo of normal proportions. Thus the volume produces  upon the eye the charm of daintiness, while the page contains a  sufficient amount of matter to make the volume profitable to the  purchaser.    This series naturally suggests comparison with the Tauchnitz editions,  which consist of volumes only slightly larger. But really no comparison  is possible. The Tauchnitz editions are merely convenient carriers of  letterpress. The Little Classics are a genuine art product. That the  latter book size has not been more widely used than it has, by its own  and by other publishers, is perhaps due to commercial reasons. But there  can be no question of the esthetic appeal which it makes upon the reader  who is looking for compactness and beauty rather than for the greatest  bulk for his money. With the modern demand for the saving of space in  private libraries we may reasonably look for a revival of this condensed  and charming book size.    The adoption of a few standard sizes for all books was urged some years  ago at a meeting of American librarians. Commenting on this proposal, a  New York publisher remarked that he should be glad to have such standard  sizes adopted by others, but he should take pains to avoid them in his  own publications in order to gain the distinction of difference. The  discussion stopped suddenly under the impact of this unexpected assault.  But a second thought shows that the publisher's comment leaves the  question still open. It is obvious that if we were to adopt standard  sizes based upon nothing more fundamental than the librarian's desire  for uniformity or the printer's mechanical convenience, without regard  to the tastes and preferences of the reader, who is the final judge, the  publisher might well find his gain in disregarding them. But if the  standards adopted all represented sizes long tested and approved by  popular favor, the publisher who should avoid them would display a  confidence in the Spirit of the Perverse as sublime as it would be  hazardous. Fortunately no formal standardization of book sizes is likely  to be attempted. But, keenly as a publisher would resent any limitation  upon his freedom in book design, he is just as keenly desirous that his  books shall be favorites. To attain his coveted end he has two  resources, experience and experiment, or a mixture of both. While the  book sizes that have been discussed in this chapter do not include all  the favorites, they certainly include some of the first favorites, and  are worthy of study by everyone who is seeking public favor in the  design of that complex art product known as a Book.          THE VALUE OF READING, TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL      Of what value is it to a community to contain--still more to be composed  of--well-read people? We can best answer this question by picturing its  opposite, a community without readers; this we are unfortunately able to  do without drawing upon our imaginations, for we have only to turn to  certain districts of countries like Spain or Russia. There we shall meet  whole communities, large enough to form cities elsewhere, which are  little more than aggregations of paupers. Shall we find in any of these  homes a daily or a weekly paper, or a monthly magazine, or even a stray  book? Not one, except perhaps in the house of a priest. These masses of  people live on the earth, to be sure, but they do not live in the world.  No currents of the great, splendid life of the twentieth century ever  reach them; and they live in equal isolation from the life of the past.  \"The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome\" have for them  simply no existence. They are truly the disinherited of all the ages.  Though they may not be unhappy, they can be called nothing less than  wretched. Is the fault one of race, or government, or religion? Much  could be said on all these points, both for and against; but one fact  remains indisputable--these people do not read.    Let us turn now to a different type of community, that represented by  the ordinary New England village. How stands the cause of reading  there? If there is any person of sound mind in the community who has  never learned to read, he is pointed out as a curiosity. There is not a  home in the length and breadth of the town that is without its paper,  its magazine, or its books. In other words, literacy is taken for  granted. Is it any wonder that in progress, wealth, and influence the  one community starts where the other leaves off? In the illiterate towns  just described there is often no man who has the slightest capacity for  business or who can represent the interests of his community before even  the humblest government official. But from towns of the other type come  men who represent with honor their state and their nation; men who widen  the bounds of freedom and who add new stars to the celestial sphere of  knowledge. Is all this wholly a matter of reading? One would not dare to  assert it absolutely, remembering the advantages of race, government,  and religion enjoyed in New England. And yet we have only to fancy the  condition of even such a town after one generation, supposing all its  printed matter and its power to read were taken away, if we would  realize what an impulse to progress and prosperity is given by the  presence of the volumes that line the shelves of our public"]]]
