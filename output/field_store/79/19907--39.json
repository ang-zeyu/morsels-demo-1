I went ashore  with them in the police-launch as a casual traveller and was amused to  hear the agent rating the old man for not having prophesied this mishap  when telling his fortune the night before.    The propagandist was merely interned in a place of security--it was not  our policy to make martyrs of such men, especially when they were _bona  fide_ Ottoman subjects.    I was rather out of touch with the pan-Islamic movement during the  summer of 1915, as my lungs had become seriously affected on the Canal,  and the trouble became so acute that I had to spend two or three months  in the hills of Cyprus. Before I had been there a week the G.O.C. troops  in Egypt cabled for me to return and proceed to Aden as political  officer with troops.    I was too ill then to move and had to cable to that effect. My chagrin  at missing a \"show\" was much alleviated when I heard what the show was.  As it had a marked effect on the pan-Islamic campaign by enhancing  Turkish prestige, it is not out of place to give some account of it  here.    While I was still on the Canal in February (1915) a \"memo\" was sent for  my information from Headquarters at Cairo to say that the Turks had  invaded the Aden protectorate at Dhala, where I once served on a  boundary commission.    I noted the fact and presumed that Aden was quite able to cope with the  situation, as the Turks had a most difficult terrain to traverse before  they could get clear of the hills and reach the littoral, while the  hinterland tribes are noted for their combatant instincts and efficiency  in guerilla warfare, besides being anti-Turk. I had, however, in spite  of many years' experience, failed to reckon with Aden apathy. True to  the policy of _laissez faire_ which was inaugurated when our Boundary  Commission withdrew some twelve years ago, Aden had been depending for  news of her own protectorate on office files and native report,  especially on that much overrated friend and ally the Lahej sultanate.  The Turks knew all about this, for the leakage of Aden affairs which  trickles through Lahej and over the Yamen border is, and has been for  years, a flagrant scandal.    The invasion at Dhala was a feint just to test the soundness of official  slumber at Aden; the obvious route for a large force was down the Tiban  valley, owing to the easier going and the permanent water-supply.    Our border-sultan (the Haushabi) was suborned with leisurely  thoroughness all unknown to his next-door neighbour, that purblind  sultanate at Lahej, unless the latter refrained from breaking Aden's  holy calm with such unpleasant news.    In May Aden stirred in her sleep and sent out the Aden troop to  reconnoitre. This fine body of Indian cavalry and camelry reported that  affairs seemed serious up the Tiban valley; then inertia reasserted  itself and they were recalled. Also the Lahej sultanate, in a spasm of  economy, started disbanding the Arab levies collected for the emergency  from the tribes of the remoter hinterland which have supplied fine  mercenaries to many oriental sultanates for many centuries.    The watchful Turk, with his unmolested spy system, had noted every move  of these pitiful blunders, and, at the psychological moment, came  pouring down the Tiban valley some 3,000 strong with another 5,000 Arab  levies. They picked up the Haushabi on the way, whose main idea was to  get a free kick at Lahej, just as an ordinary human boy will serve some  sneak and prig to whom a slack schoolmaster has relegated his own  obvious duty of supervision. To do that inadequate sultanate justice, it  tried to bar the way with its own trencher-fed troops and such levies as  it had, but was brushed aside contemptuously by the hardier levies  opposed to it and the overwhelming fire of the Turkish field batteries.  Then a distraught and frantic palace emitted mounted messengers to Aden  for assistance like minute-guns from a sinking ship.    Aden behaved exactly like a startled hen. She ran about clucking and  collecting motor-cars, camel transport, anything. The authorities dared  not leave their pet sultan in the lurch--questions might be asked in the  House. On the other hand they had made no adequate arrangements to  protect him. Just as a demented hen will leave her brood at the mercy of  a hovering kite to round up one stray chick instead of sitting tight and  calling it in under her wing, so Aden made a belated and insane attempt  to save Lahej.    The Aden Movable Column, a weak brigade of Indians, young Territorials,  and guns, marched out at 2 p.m. on July 4, _i.e._ at the hottest time of  day, in the hottest season of the year and the hottest part of the  world. Motor-cars were used to convey the infantry of the advanced  guard, but the main body had to march in full equipment with ammunition.  The casualties from sunstroke were appalling. The late G.O.C. troops in  Egypt mentioned them to me in hundreds, and one of the Aden \"politicals\"  told me that not a dozen of the territorial battalion remained effective  at the end of the day. Many were bowled over by the heat before they had  gone two miles.    Most of the native camel transport, carrying water, ammunition and  supplies,--and yet unescorted and not even attended by a responsible  officer--sauntered off into the desert and vanished from the ken of that  ill-fated column.    Meanwhile the advanced guard of 250 men (mostly Indians) and two  10-pounder mountain-guns pushed on with all speed to Lahej, which was  being attacked by several thousand Turks and Turco-Arabs with 15-pounder  field batteries and machine-guns. They found the palace and part of the  town on fire when they arrived, and fought the Turks hand-to-hand in the  streets. They held on all through that sweltering night, and only  retired when dawn showed them the hopeless nature of their task and the  fact that they were being outflanked. They fell back on the main body,  which had stuck halfway at a wayside well (Bir Nasir) marked so  obviously by ruins that even Aden guides could not miss it. Shortage of  water was the natural result of sitting over a well that does not even  supply a settlement, but merely the ordinary needs of wayfarers.    This well is marked on the Aden protectorate survey map (which is  procurable by the general public) as Bir Muhammad, its full name being  Bir Muhammad Nasir. There are five wells supplying settlements within  half an hour's walk of it on either side of the track, but when we  remember that the column's field-guns got no further owing to heavy  sand, and that the aforesaid track is frequently traversed by ordinary  _tikkagharries_, we realise the local knowledge available.    The column straggled back to the frontier town of Sheikh Othman, which  they prepared to defend, but Simla, by this time thoroughly alarmed,  ordered them back for the defence of Aden, and they returned without  definite achievement other than the accidental shooting of the Lahej  sultan. This was hardly the fault of the heroic little band which  reached Lahej; that ill-starred potentate was escaping with his mounted  retinue before dawn and cantered on top of an Indian outpost without the  formality of answering their challenge. He was brought away in a  motor-car and died at Aden a few days later--another victim to this  deplorable blunder. Any intelligent and timely grasp of the enemy's  strength and intention would have given the poor man ample time to pack  his inlaid hookahs, Persian carpets, and other palace treasures and  withdraw in safety to Aden while our troops made good the Sheikh Othman  line along the British frontier. I am presuming that Aden was too much  taken by surprise to have met the Turks in a position of her own  choosing while they were still entangled in hilly country where levies  of the right sort could have harried them to some purpose, backed by  disciplined, unspent troops and adequate guns. What I wish to impress  is that the Intelligence Department at Aden must have been abominably  served and organised, for I decline to believe that _any_ G.O.C. would  have attempted such an enterprise with such a force and at such a time  had he any information as to the real nature of his task. As it was, the  British town of Sheikh Othman, within easy sight of Aden across the  harbour, was held by the Turks until a reinforcing column came down from  the Canal and drove them out of it, while the protectorate has been  overrun by the Turks and the Turco-Arabs until long after the armistice,  and the state of British prestige there can be imagined.    Official attempts to gloze over the incident would have been amusing if  they were not pathetic. Needless to say they did not deceive Moslems in  Egypt or the rest of Arabia.    Here is the most accurate account they gave the public:          \"TURKS AND ADEN.        \"ENGAGEMENT AT LAHEJ.        \"The India Office issued the following _communique_ last night      through the Press Bureau:          \"'In consequence of rumours that a Turkish force from the        Yamen had crossed the frontier of the Aden Hinterland and        was advancing towards Lahej, the General Officer Commanding        at Aden recently dispatched the Aden Camel Troop to        reconnoitre.          \"'They reported the presence of a Turkish force with        field-guns and a large number of Arabs and fell back on        Lahej, where they were reinforced by the advance guard of        the Aden Movable Column consisting of 250 rifles and two        10-pounder guns.          \"'Our force at Lahej was attacked by the enemy on July 4 by        a force of several thousand Turks with twenty guns and        large numbers of Arabs, and maintained its position in face        of the enemy artillery's fire until night, when part of        Lahej was in flames.

How good that mash was! and so soft  and healing to my mouth. He stood by all the time I was eating, stroking  me and talking to the man. 'If a high-mettled creature like this,'  said he, 'can't be broken by fair means, she will never be good for  anything.'    \"After that he often came to see me, and when my mouth was healed the  other breaker, Job, they called him, went on training me; he was steady  and thoughtful, and I soon learned what he wanted.\"          08 Ginger's Story Continued      The next time that Ginger and I were together in the paddock she told me  about her first place.    \"After my breaking in,\" she said, \"I was bought by a dealer to match  another chestnut horse. For some weeks he drove us together, and then we  were sold to a fashionable gentleman, and were sent up to London. I had  been driven with a check-rein by the dealer, and I hated it worse  than anything else; but in this place we were reined far tighter, the  coachman and his master thinking we looked more stylish so. We were  often driven about in the park and other fashionable places. You who  never had a check-rein on don't know what it is, but I can tell you it  is dreadful.    \"I like to toss my head about and hold it as high as any horse; but  fancy now yourself, if you tossed your head up high and were obliged to  hold it there, and that for hours together, not able to move it at all,  except with a jerk still higher, your neck aching till you did not know  how to bear it. Besides that, to have two bits instead of one--and mine  was a sharp one, it hurt my tongue and my jaw, and the blood from my  tongue colored the froth that kept flying from my lips as I chafed and  fretted at the bits and rein. It was worst when we had to stand by the  hour waiting for our mistress at some grand party or entertainment, and  if I fretted or stamped with impatience the whip was laid on. It was  enough to drive one mad.\"    \"Did not your master take any thought for you?\" I said.    \"No,\" said she, \"he only cared to have a stylish turnout, as they  call it; I think he knew very little about horses; he left that to his  coachman, who told him I had an irritable temper! that I had not been  well broken to the check-rein, but I should soon get used to it; but he  was not the man to do it, for when I was in the stable, miserable and  angry, instead of being smoothed and quieted by kindness, I got only a  surly word or a blow. If he had been civil I would have tried to  bear it. I was willing to work, and ready to work hard too; but to be  tormented for nothing but their fancies angered me. What right had they  to make me suffer like that? Besides the soreness in my mouth, and  the pain in my neck, it always made my windpipe feel bad, and if I had  stopped there long I know it would have spoiled my breathing; but I grew  more and more restless and irritable, I could not help it; and I began  to snap and kick when any one came to harness me; for this the groom  beat me, and one day, as they had just buckled us into the carriage,  and were straining my head up with that rein, I began to plunge and  kick with all my might. I soon broke a lot of harness, and kicked myself  clear; so that was an end of that place.    \"After this I was sent to Tattersall's to be sold; of course I could not  be warranted free from vice, so nothing was said about that. My handsome  appearance and good paces soon brought a gentleman to bid for me, and I  was bought by another dealer; he tried me in all kinds of ways and with  different bits, and he soon found out what I could not bear. At last  he drove me quite without a check-rein, and then sold me as a perfectly  quiet horse to a gentleman in the country; he was a good master, and I  was getting on very well, but his old groom left him and a new one came.  This man was as hard-tempered and hard-handed as Samson; he always spoke  in a rough, impatient voice, and if I did not move in the stall the  moment he wanted me, he would hit me above the hocks with his stable  broom or the fork, whichever he might have in his hand. Everything he  did was rough, and I began to hate him; he wanted to make me afraid  of him, but I was too high-mettled for that, and one day when he had  aggravated me more than usual I bit him, which of course put him in a  great rage, and he began to hit me about the head with a riding whip.  After that he never dared to come into my stall again; either my heels  or my teeth were ready for him, and he knew it. I was quite quiet with  my master, but of course he listened to what the man said, and so I was  sold again.    \"The same dealer heard of me, and said he thought he knew one place  where I should do well. ''Twas a pity,' he said, 'that such a fine horse  should go to the bad, for want of a real good chance,' and the end of it  was that I came here not long before you did; but I had then made up my  mind that men were my natural enemies and that I must defend myself. Of  course it is very different here, but who knows how long it will last? I  wish I could think about things as you do; but I can't, after all I have  gone through.\"    \"Well,\" I said, \"I think it would be a real shame if you were to bite or  kick John or James.\"    \"I don't mean to,\" she said, \"while they are good to me. I did bite  James once pretty sharp, but John said, 'Try her with kindness,' and  instead of punishing me as I expected, James came to me with his arm  bound up, and brought me a bran mash and stroked me; and I have never  snapped at him since, and I won't either.\"    I was sorry for Ginger, but of course I knew very little then, and I  thought most likely she made the worst of it; however, I found that as  the weeks went on she grew much more gentle and cheerful, and had lost  the watchful, defiant look that she used to turn on any strange person  who came near her; and one day James said, \"I do believe that mare is  getting fond of me, she quite whinnied after me this morning when I had  been rubbing her forehead.\"    \"Ay, ay, Jim, 'tis 'the Birtwick balls',\" said John, \"she'll be as good  as Black Beauty by and by; kindness is all the physic she wants, poor  thing!\" Master noticed the change, too, and one day when he got out of  the carriage and came to speak to us, as he often did, he stroked her  beautiful neck. \"Well, my pretty one, well, how do things go with you  now? You are a good bit happier than when you came to us, I think.\"    She put her nose up to him in a friendly, trustful way, while he rubbed  it gently.    \"We shall make a cure of her, John,\" he said.    \"Yes, sir, she's wonderfully improved; she's not the same creature that  she was; it's 'the Birtwick balls', sir,\" said John, laughing.    This was a little joke of John's; he used to say that a regular course  of \"the Birtwick horseballs\" would cure almost any vicious horse; these  balls, he said, were made up of patience and gentleness, firmness and  petting, one pound of each to be mixed up with half a pint of common  sense, and given to the horse every day.          09 Merrylegs      Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls;  sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One  of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and  there were several little ones. When they came there was plenty of work  for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by  turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and  this they would do by the hour together.    One afternoon he had been out with them a long time, and when James  brought him in and put on his halter he said:    \"There, you rogue, mind how you behave yourself, or we shall get into  trouble.\"    \"What have you been doing, Merrylegs?\" I asked.    \"Oh!\" said he, tossing his little head, \"I have only been giving those  young people a lesson; they did not know when they had had enough, nor  when I had had enough, so I just pitched them off backward; that was the  only thing they could understand.\"    \"What!\" said I, \"you threw the children off? I thought you did know  better than that! Did you throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora?\"    He looked very much offended, and said:    \"Of course not; I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever  came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the  master could be, and as for the little ones it is I who teach them to  ride. When they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back I go as  smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird; and when they  are all right I go on again faster, you see, just to use them to it; so  don't you trouble yourself preaching to me; I am the best friend and the  best riding-master those children have. It is not them, it is the boys;  boys,\" said he, shaking his mane, \"are quite different; they must be  broken in as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught  what's what. The other children had ridden me about for nearly two  hours, and then the boys thought it was their turn, and so it was, and  I was quite agreeable. They rode me by turns, and I galloped them about,  up and down the fields and all about the orchard, for a good hour. They  had each cut a great hazel stick for a riding-whip, and laid it on a  little too hard; but I took it in good part, till at last I thought we  had had enough, so I stopped two or three times by way of a hint.  Boys, you see, think a horse or pony is like a steam-engine or a  thrashing-machine, and can go on as long and as fast as they please;  they never think that a pony can get tired, or have any feelings; so as  the one who was whipping me could not understand I just rose up on  my hind legs and let him slip off behind--that was all. He mounted me  again, and I did the same. Then the other boy got up, and as soon as  he began to use his stick I laid him on the grass, and so on, till they"]]]
