The sumach leaf is also used by the Indians in the same way,  and has a similar taste to the willow bark. A decoction of the dried  wild or horse mint, which we found abundant under the snow, was quite  palatable, and answered instead of coffee. It dries up in that climate,  but does not lose its flavor. We suffered greatly for the want of salt;  but, by burning the outside of our mule steaks, and sprinkling a little  gunpowder upon them, it did not require a very extensive stretch of the  imagination to fancy the presence of both salt and pepper. We tried the  meat of horse, colt, and mules, all of which were in a starved  condition, and of course not very tender, juicy, or nutritious. We  consumed the enormous amount of from five to six pounds of this meat  per man daily, but continued to grow weak and thin, until, at the  expiration of twelve days, we were able to perform but little labor,  and were continually craving for fat meat.    The allowance of provisions for each grown person, to make the journey  from the Missouri River to California, should suffice for 110 days. The  following is deemed requisite, viz.: 150 lbs. of flour, or its  equivalent in hard bread; 25 lbs. of bacon or pork, and enough fresh  beef to be driven on the hoof to make up the meat component of the  ration; 15 lbs. of coffee, and 25 lbs. of sugar; also a quantity of  saleratus or yeast powders for making bread, and salt and pepper.    These are the chief articles of subsistence necessary for the trip, and  they should be used with economy, reserving a good portion for the  western half of the journey. Heretofore many of the California  emigrants have improvidently exhausted their stocks of provisions  before reaching their journey's end, and have, in many cases, been  obliged to pay the most exorbitant prices in making up the deficiency.    It is true that if persons choose to pass through Salt Lake City, and  the Mormons _happen_ to be in an amiable mood, supplies may sometimes  be procured from them; but those who have visited them well know how  little reliance is to be placed upon their hospitality or spirit of  accommodation.    I once traveled with a party of New Yorkers _en route_ for California.  They were perfectly ignorant of every thing relating to this kind of  campaigning, and had overloaded their wagons with almost every thing  except the very articles most important and necessary; the consequence  was, that they exhausted their teams, and were obliged to throw away  the greater part of their loading. They soon learned that Champagne,  East India sweetmeats, olives, etc., etc., were not the most useful  articles for a prairie tour.      CLOTHING.    A suitable dress for prairie traveling is of great import to health and  comfort. Cotton or linen fabrics do not sufficiently protect the body  against the direct rays of the sun at midday, nor against rains or  sudden changes of temperature. Wool, being a non-conductor, is the best  material for this mode of locomotion, and should always be adopted for  the plains. The coat should be short and stout, the shirt of red or  blue flannel, such as can be found in almost all the shops on the  frontier: this, in warm weather, answers for an outside garment. The  pants should be of thick and soft woolen material, and it is well to  have them re-enforced on the inside, where they come in contact with  the saddle, with soft buckskin, which makes them more durable and  comfortable.    Woolen socks and stout boots, coming up well at the knees, and made  large, so as to admit the pants, will be found the best for horsemen,  and they guard against rattlesnake bites.    In traveling through deep snow during very cold weather in winter,  moccasins are preferable to boots or shoes, as being more pliable, and  allowing a freer circulation of the blood. In crossing the Rocky  Mountains in the winter, the weather being intensely cold, I wore two  pairs of woolen socks, and a square piece of thick blanket sufficient  to cover the feet and ankles, over which were drawn a pair of thick  buckskin moccasins, and the whole enveloped in a pair of buffalo-skin  boots with the hair inside, made open in the front and tied with  buckskin strings. At the same time I wore a pair of elkskin pants,  which most effectually prevented the air from penetrating to the skin,  and made an excellent defense against brush and thorns.    My men, who were dressed in the regulation clothing, wore out their  pants and shoes before we reached the summit of the mountains, and many  of them had their feet badly frozen in consequence. They mended their  shoes with pieces of leather cut from the saddle-skirts as long as they  lasted, and, when this material was gone, they covered the entire shoe  with green beeve or mule hide, drawn together and sewed upon the top,  with the hair inside, which protected the upper as well as the sole  leather. The sewing was done with an awl and buckskin strings. These  simple expedients contributed greatly to the comfort of the party; and,  indeed, I am by no means sure that they did not, in our straitened  condition, without the transportation necessary for carrying disabled  men, save the lives of some of them. Without the awl and buckskins we  should have been unable to have repaired the shoes. They should never  be forgotten in making up the outfit for a prairie expedition.    We also experienced great inconvenience and pain by the reflection of  the sun's rays from the snow upon our eyes, and some of the party  became nearly snow-blind. Green or blue glasses, inclosed in a wire  net-work, are an effectual protection to the eyes; but, in the absence  of these, the skin around the eyes and upon the nose should be  blackened with wet powder or charcoal, which will afford great relief.    In the summer season shoes are much better for footmen than boots, as  they are lighter, and do not cramp the ankles; the soles should be  broad, so as to allow a square, firm tread, without distorting or  pinching the feet.    The following list of articles is deemed a sufficient outfit for one  man upon a three months' expedition, viz.:        2 blue or red flannel overshirts, open in front, with buttons.      2 woolen undershirts.      2 pairs thick cotton drawers.      4 pairs woolen socks.      2 pairs cotton socks.      4 colored silk handkerchiefs.      2 pairs stout shoes, for footmen.      1 pair boots, for horsemen.      1 pair shoes, for horsemen.      3 towels.      1 gutta percha poncho.      1 broad-brimmed hat of soft felt.      1 comb and brush.      2 tooth-brushes.      1 pound Castile soap.      3 pounds bar soap for washing   clothes.      1 belt-knife and small whetstone.      Stout linen thread, large needles, a bit of beeswax, a few        buttons, paper of pins, and a thimble, all contained in        a small buckskin or stout cloth bag.    The foregoing articles, with the coat and overcoat, complete the  wardrobe.      CAMP EQUIPAGE.    The bedding for each person should consist of two blankets, a  comforter, and a pillow, and a gutta percha or painted canvas cloth to  spread beneath the bed upon the ground, and to contain it when rolled  up for transportation.    Every mess of six or eight persons will require a wrought-iron camp  kettle, large enough for boiling meat and making soup; a coffee-pot and  cups of heavy tin, with the handles riveted on; tin plates, frying and  bake pans of wrought iron, the latter for baking bread and roasting  coffee. Also a mess pan of heavy tin or wrought iron for mixing bread  and other culinary purposes; knives, forks, and spoons; an extra camp  kettle; tin or gutta percha bucket for water--wood, being liable to  shrink and fall to pieces, is not deemed suitable; an axe, hatchet, and  spade will also be needed, with a mallet for driving picket-pins.  Matches should be carried in bottles and corked tight, so as to exclude  the moisture.    A little blue mass, quinine, opium, and some cathartic medicine, put up  in doses for adults, will suffice for the medicine-chest.    Each ox wagon should be provided with a covered tar-bucket, filled with  a mixture of tar or resin and grease, two bows extra, six S's, and six  open links for repairing chains. Every set of six wagons should have a  tongue, coupling pole, king-bolt, and pair of hounds extra.    Every set of six mule wagons should be furnished with five pairs of  hames, two double trees, four whipple-trees, and two pairs of lead bars  extra.    Two lariats will be needed for every horse and mule, as one generally  wears out before reaching the end of a long journey. They will be found  useful in crossing deep streams, and in letting wagons down steep hills  and mountains; also in repairing broken wagons. Lariats made of hemp  are the best.    One of the most indispensable articles to the outfit of the prairie  traveler is buckskin. For repairing harness, saddles, bridles, and  numerous other purposes of daily necessity, the awl and buckskin will  be found in constant requisition.      ARMS.    Every man who goes into the Indian country should be armed with a rifle  and revolver, and he should never, either in camp or out of it, lose  sight of them. When not on the march, they should be placed in such a  position that they can be seized at an instant's warning; and when  moving about outside the camp, the revolver should invariably be worn  in the belt, as the person does not know at what moment he may have use  for it.    A great diversity of opinion obtains regarding the kind of rifle that  is the most efficient and best adapted to Indian warfare, and the  question is perhaps as yet very far from being settled to the  satisfaction of all. A large majority of men prefer the breech-loading  arm, but there are those who still adhere tenaciously to the  old-fashioned muzzle-loading rifle as preferable to any of the modern  inventions. Among these may be mentioned the border hunters and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23169"],[0,"The Diamond Lens (#5)"],[1,"of animal  life, perhaps of a lower class than any with which we are at present  acquainted, but still some living organism. I found my newly discovered  world, if I may so speak, a beautiful chromatic desert.    While I was speculating on the singular arrangements of the internal  economy of Nature, with which she so frequently splinters into atoms our  most compact theories, I thought I beheld a form moving slowly through  the glades of one of the prismatic forests. I looked more attentively,  and found that I was not mistaken. Words can not depict the anxiety with  which I awaited the nearer approach of this mysterious object. Was it  merely some inanimate substance, held in suspense in the attenuated  atmosphere of the globule, or was it an animal endowed with vitality  and motion? It approached, flitting behind the gauzy, colored veils of  cloud-foliage, for seconds dimly revealed, then vanishing. At last the  violet pennons that trailed nearest to me vibrated; they were gently  pushed aside, and the form floated out into the broad light.    It was a female human shape. When I say human, I mean it possessed the  outlines of humanity; but there the analogy ends. Its adorable beauty  lifted it illimitable heights beyond the loveliest daughter of Adam.    I can not, I dare not, attempt to inventory the charms of this divine  revelation of perfect beauty. Those eyes of mystic violet, dewy and  serene, evade my words. Her long, lustrous hair following her glorious  head in a golden wake, like the track sown in heaven by a falling star,  seems to quench my most burning phrases with its splendors. If all the  bees of Hybla nestled upon my lips, they would still sing but hoarsely  the wondrous harmonies of outline that inclosed her form.    She swept out from between the rainbow-curtains of the cloud-trees into  the broad sea of light that lay beyond. Her motions were those of some  graceful naiad, cleaving, by a mere effort of her will, the clear,  unruffled waters that fill the chambers of the sea. She floated forth  with the serene grace of a frail bubble ascending through the still  atmosphere of a June day. The perfect roundness of her limbs formed  suave and enchanting curves. It was like listening to the most spiritual  symphony of Beethoven the divine, to watch the harmonious flow of lines.  This, indeed was a pleasure cheaply purchased at any price. What cared  I if I had waded to the portal of this wonder through another's blood.  I would have given my own to enjoy one such moment of intoxication and  delight.    Breathless with gazing on this lovely wonder, and forgetful for an  instant of everything save her presence, I withdrew my eye from the  microscope eagerly. Alas! as my gaze fell on the thin slide that lay  beneath my instrument, the bright light from mirror and from prism  sparkled on a colorless drop of water! There, in that tiny bead of dew,  this beautiful being was forever imprisoned. The planet Neptune was not  more distant from me than she. I hastened once more to apply my eye to  the microscope.    Animula (let me now call her by that dear name which I subsequently  bestowed on her) had changed her position. She had again approached the  wondrous forest, and was gazing earnestly upward. Presently one of the  trees--as I must call them--unfolded a long ciliary process, with which  it seized one of the gleaming fruits that glittered on its summit, and,  sweeping slowly down, held it within reach of Animula. The sylph took  it in her delicate hand and began to eat. My attention was so entirely  absorbed by her that I could not apply myself to the task of determining  whether this singular plant was or was not instinct with volition.    I watched her, as she made her repast, with the most profound attention.  The suppleness of her motions sent a thrill of delight through my frame;  my heart beat madly as she turned her beautiful eyes in the direction of  the spot in which I stood. What would I not have given to have had the  power to precipitate myself into that luminous ocean and float with her  through those grooves of purple and gold! While I was thus breathlessly  following her every movement, she suddenly started, seemed to listen  for a moment, and then cleaving the brilliant ether in which she was  floating, like a flash of light, pierced through the opaline forest and  disappeared.    Instantly a series of the most singular sensations attacked me. It  seemed as if I had suddenly gone blind. The luminous sphere was still  before me, but my daylight had vanished. What caused this sudden  disappearance? Had she a lover or a husband? Yes, that was the solution!  Some signal from a happy fellow-being had vibrated through the avenues  of the forest, and she had obeyed the summons.    The agony of my sensations, as I arrived at this conclusion, startled  me. I tried to reject the conviction that my reason forced upon me. I  battled against the fatal conclusion--but in vain. It was so. I had no  escape from it. I loved an animalcule.    It is true that, thanks to the marvelous power of my microscope, she  appeared of human proportions. Instead of presenting the revolting  aspect of the coarser creatures, that live and struggle and die, in  the more easily resolvable portions of the water-drop, she was fair and  delicate and of surpassing beauty. But of what account was all that?  Every time that my eye was withdrawn from the instrument it fell on a  miserable drop of water, within which, I must be content to know, dwelt  all that could make my life lovely.    Could she but see me once! Could I for one moment pierce the mystical  walls that so inexorably rose to separate us, and whisper all that  filled my soul, I might consent to be satisfied for the rest of my life  with the knowledge of her remote sympathy.    It would be something to have established even the faintest personal  link to bind us together--to know that at times, when roaming through  these enchanted glades, she might think of the wonderful stranger who  had broken the monotony of her life with his presence and left a gentle  memory in her heart!    But it could not be. No invention of which human intellect was capable  could break down the barriers that nature had erected. I might feast my  soul upon her wondrous beauty, yet she must always remain ignorant  of the adoring eyes that day and night gazed upon her, and, even when  closed, beheld her in dreams. With a bitter cry of anguish I fled from  the room, and flinging myself on my bed, sobbed myself to sleep like a  child.          VI    I arose the next morning almost at daybreak, and rushed to my  microscope, I trembled as I sought the luminous world in miniature that  contained my all. Animula was there. I had left the gas-lamp, surrounded  by its moderators, burning when I went to bed the night before. I found  the sylph bathing, as it were, with an expression of pleasure animating  her features, in the brilliant light which surrounded her. She tossed  her lustrous golden hair over her shoulders with innocent coquetry. She  lay at full length in the transparent medium, in which she supported  herself with ease, and gamboled with the enchanting grace that the nymph  Salmacis might have exhibited when she sought to conquer the modest  Hermaphroditus. I tried an experiment to satisfy myself if her powers of  reflection were developed. I lessened the lamplight considerably. By the  dim light that remained, I could see an expression of pain flit across  her face. She looked upward suddenly, and her brows contracted. I  flooded the stage of the microscope again with a full stream of light,  and her whole expression changed. She sprang forward like some some  substance deprived of all weight. Her eyes sparkled and her lips moved.  Ah! if science had only the means of conducting and reduplicating  sounds, as it does rays of light, what carols of happiness would then  have entranced my ears! what jubilant hymns to Adonais would have  thrilled the illumined air!    I now comprehended how it was that the Count de Cabalis peopled his  mystic world with sylphs-beautiful beings whose breath of life was  lambent fire, and who sported forever in regions of purest ether and  purest light. The Rosicrucian had anticipated the wonder that I had  practically realized.    How long this worship of my strange divinity went on thus I scarcely  know. I lost all note of time. All day from early dawn, and far into the  night, I was to be found peering through that wonderful lens. I saw  no one, went nowhere, and scarce allowed myself sufficient time for my  meals. My whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as that of  any of the Romish saints. Every hour that I gazed upon the divine form  strengthened my passion--a passion that was always overshadowed by the  maddening conviction that, although I could gaze on her at will, she  never, never could behold me!    At length I grew so pale and emaciated, from want of rest and continual  brooding over my insane love and its cruel conditions, that I determined  to make some effort to wean myself from it. \"Come,\" I said, \"this is  at best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on Animula charms  which in reality she does not possess. Seclusion from female society has  produced this morbid condition of mind. Compare her with the beautiful  women of your own world, and this false enchantment will vanish.\"    I looked over the newspapers by chance. There I beheld the advertisement  of a celebrated _danseuse_ who appeared nightly at Niblo's. The  Signorina Caradolce had the reputation of being the most beautiful as  well as the most graceful woman in the world. I instantly dressed and  went to the theatre.    The curtain drew up. The usual semicircle of fairies in white muslin  were standing on the right toe around the enameled flower-bank of green  canvas, on which the belated prince was sleeping. Suddenly a flute is  heard.
