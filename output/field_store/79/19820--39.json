Put a layer of clams, then the potatoes, salt and pepper, and  bits of butter; dredge with flour when all the clams and potatoes are  used. Add the liquor and a little water if necessary. Put on the top  crust, cutting several slits in it for the steam to escape. Bake 45  minutes.      14.--Broiled Live Lobster.    Kill the lobster by inserting a sharp knife in its back between the body  and tail shells cutting the spinal cord. Split the shell the entire  length of the back, remove the stomach and intestinal canal, crack the  large claws and lay the fish as flat as possible. Brush the meat with  melted butter, season with salt and pepper, place in a broiler, and with  the flesh side down, cover and broil slowly until a delicate brown,  about 20 minutes. Turn the broiler and broil 10 minutes longer. Serve  hot, with a sauce of melted butter.      15.--Cheese Fondu, No. 2.

Mince cold cooked veal and ham in the proportion of 2/3 veal and 1/3  ham. A few mushrooms are a pleasing addition. To each cup of the mixture  allow a tablespoonful of fine crumbs; season highly with salt, a dash of  cayenne, a little lemon juice, and a teaspoonful of catsup. Wet up with  stock, or butter and water, and heat in a vessel set in another of hot  water, to a smoking boil.

I have observed that any unusual disturbance in the woods, near where  the chipmunk has his den, will cause him to shift his quarters. One  October, for many successive days, I saw one carrying into his hole  buckwheat which he had stolen from a near field. The hole was only a few  rods from where we were getting out stone, and as our work progressed,  and the racket and uproar increased, the chipmunk became alarmed. He  ceased carrying in, and after much hesitating and darting about, and  some prolonged absences, he began to carry out; he had determined to  move; if the mountain fell, he, at least, would be away in time. So, by  mouthfuls or cheekfuls, the grain was transferred to a new place. He did  not make a \"bee\" to get it done, but carried it all himself, occupying  several days, and making a trip about every ten minutes.          III    THE WOODCHUCK      In the Middle and Eastern States our woodchuck takes the place, in some  respects, of the English rabbit, burrowing in every hillside and under  every stone wall and jutting ledge and large boulder, whence it makes  raids upon the grass and clover and sometimes upon the garden  vegetables. It is quite solitary in its habits, seldom more than one  inhabiting the same den, unless it be a mother and her young. It is not  now so much a _wood_ chuck as a _field_ chuck. Occasionally, however,  one seems to prefer the woods, and is not seduced by the sunny slopes  and the succulent grass, but feeds, as did his fathers before him, upon  roots and twigs, the bark of young trees, and upon various wood plants.    One summer day, as I was swimming across a broad, deep pool in the creek  in a secluded place in the woods, I saw one of these sylvan chucks amid  the rocks but a few feet from the edge of the water where I proposed to  touch. He saw my approach, but doubtless took me for some water-fowl,  or for some cousin of his of the muskrat tribe; for he went on with his  feeding, and regarded me not till I paused within ten feet of him and  lifted myself up. Then he did not know me, having, perhaps, never seen  Adam in his simplicity, but he twisted his nose around to catch my  scent; and the moment he had done so he sprang like a jumping-jack and  rushed into his den with the utmost precipitation.    The woodchuck is the true serf among our animals; he belongs to the  soil, and savors of it. He is of the earth, earthy. There is generally a  decided odor about his dens and lurking places, but it is not at all  disagreeable in the clover-scented air; and his shrill whistle, as he  takes to his hole or defies the farm dog from the interior of the stone  wall, is a pleasant summer sound. In form and movement the woodchuck is  not captivating. His body is heavy and flabby. Indeed, such a flaccid,  fluid, pouchy carcass I have never before seen. It has absolutely no  muscular tension or rigidity, but is as baggy and shaky as a skin filled  with water. The legs of the woodchuck are short and stout, and made for  digging rather than running. The latter operation he performs by short  leaps, his belly scarcely clearing the ground. For a short distance he  can make very good time, but he seldom trusts himself far from his hole,  and, when surprised in that predicament, makes little effort to escape,  but, grating his teeth, looks the danger squarely in the face.    I knew a farmer in New York who had a very large bobtailed churn-dog by  the name of Cuff. The farmer kept a large dairy and made a great deal of  butter, and it was the business of Cuff to spend nearly the half of each  summer day treading the endless round of the churning-machine. During  the remainder of the day he had plenty of time to sleep and rest, and  sit on his hips and survey the landscape. One day, sitting thus, he  discovered a woodchuck about forty rods from the house, on a steep  sidehill, feeding about near his hole, which was beneath a large rock.  The old dog, forgetting his stiffness, and remembering the fun he had  had with woodchucks in his earlier days, started off at his highest  speed, vainly hoping to catch this one before he could get to his hole.  But the woodchuck, seeing the dog come laboring up the hill, sprang to  the mouth of his den, and, when his pursuer was only a few rods off,  whistled tauntingly and went in. This occurred several times, the old  dog marching up the hill, and then marching down again, having had his  labor for his pains.    [Illustration: WOODCHUCK]    I suspect that he revolved the subject in his mind while revolving the  great wheel of the churning-machine, and that some turn or other brought  him a happy thought, for next time he showed himself a strategist.  Instead of giving chase to the woodchuck, when first discovered, he  crouched down to the ground, and, resting his head on his paws, watched  him. The woodchuck kept working away from his hole, lured by the tender  clover, but, not unmindful of his safety, lifted himself up on his  haunches every few moments and surveyed the approaches. Presently, after  the woodchuck had let himself down from one of these attitudes of  observation and resumed his feeding, Cuff started swiftly but stealthily  up the hill, precisely in the attitude of a cat when she is stalking a  bird. When the woodchuck rose up again, Cuff was perfectly motionless  and half hid by the grass. When he again resumed his clover, Cuff sped  up the hill as before, this time crossing a fence, but in a low place,  and so nimbly that he was not discovered. Again the woodchuck was on the  outlook, again Cuff was motionless and hugging the ground. As the dog  neared his victim he was partially hidden by a swell in the earth, but  still the woodchuck from his outlook reported \"All right,\" when Cuff,  having not twice as far to run as the chuck, threw all stealthiness  aside and rushed directly for the hole. At that moment the woodchuck  discovered his danger, and, seeing that it was a race for life, leaped  as I never saw marmot leap before. But he was two seconds too late, his  retreat was cut off, and the powerful jaws of the old dog closed upon  him.    The next season Cuff tried the same tactics again with like success, but  when the third woodchuck had taken up his abode at the fatal hole, the  old churner's wits and strength had begun to fail him, and he was  baffled in each attempt to capture the animal.    The woodchuck usually burrows on a sidehill. This enables him to guard  against being drowned out, by making the termination of the hole higher  than the entrance. He digs in slantingly for about two or three feet,  then makes a sharp upward turn and keeps nearly parallel with the  surface of the ground for a distance of eight or ten feet farther,  according to the grade. Here he makes his nest and passes the winter,  holing up in October or November and coming out again in March or April.  This is a long sleep, and is rendered possible only by the amount of fat  with which the system has become stored during the summer. The fire of  life still burns, but very faintly and slowly, as with the draughts all  closed and the ashes heaped up. Respiration is continued, but at longer  intervals, and all the vital processes are nearly at a standstill. Dig  one out during hibernation (Audubon did so), and you find it a mere  inanimate ball, that suffers itself to be moved and rolled about without  showing signs of awakening. But bring it in by the fire, and it  presently unrolls and opens its eyes, and crawls feebly about, and if  left to itself will seek some dark hole or corner, roll itself up again,  and resume its former condition.          IV    THE RABBIT AND THE HARE      With us the hare is of the remote northern woods, the rabbit is of the  fields and bushy margins of the woods. One retreats before man and  civilization, the other follows in their wake. The rabbit is now common  in parts of our State (New York) where in my boyhood only the hare was  found. The rabbit evidently loves to be neighbor to man and profits by  it. Nearly every winter one takes up her abode under my study floor, and  when the snow is deep and the weather is cold she usually finds every  night a couple of sweet apples on her threshold. I suppose she thinks  they grow there, or are blown there by the wind like the snow. At such  times she does not leave her retreat; the apples are good fortune  enough. If I neglect to put them there, in the morning I see where she  has gone forth over the lawn looking for them, or for some other food.    I wonder if that fox chanced to catch a glimpse of her the other night  when he stealthily leaped over the fence near by and walked along  between the study and the house? How clearly one could read that it was  not a little dog that had passed there! There was something furtive in  the track; it shied off away from the house and around it, as if eyeing  it suspiciously; and then it had the caution and deliberation of the  fox,--bold, bold, but not too bold; wariness was in every footprint. If  it had been a little dog that had chanced to wander that way, when he  crossed my path he would have followed it up to the barn and have gone  smelling around for a bone; but this sharp, cautious track held straight  across all others, keeping five or six rods from the house, up the hill,  across the highway toward a neighboring farmstead, with its nose in the  air, and its eye and ear alert, so to speak.    One summer a wild rabbit came up within a few feet of my neighbor's  house, scooped out a little place in the turf, and reared her family  there. I suppose she felt more secure from prowling cats and dogs than  in the garden or vineyard. My neighbor took me out to let me into her  secret. He pointed down to the ground a few feet in front of us and  said, \"There it is.\" I looked "]]]
