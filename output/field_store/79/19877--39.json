[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#5)"],[1," Jean and I looked at each other with  astonishment. As for Morand, he was overjoyed.    \"Well, comtesse,\" said he, \"behold the number of your slaves increased  by an illustrious adorer. You have made a conquest of M. Lebel, and I am  certain he has gone away deeply smitten.\"    \"I hope we shall see him again,\" said comte Jean.    \"Do you doubt it?\"    \"Assure him,\" said I, \"of the pleasure it will afford us to receive him  as he merits.\"    Several persons entered, and M. Morand, profiting by the bustle which  their entrance occasioned, approached me, and said, in a low tone,    \"You are in possession of his heart, will you charge me with any message  to him?\"    \"M. Morand,\" was my reply, \"what are you thinking of? A woman of my rank  throw herself at any person's head?\"    \"No, certainly not; but you can send him a kind word, or some  affectionate token.\"    \"I could not think of it; M. Lebel appeared to me a most agreeable man,  and I shall be at all times delighted to see him.\"    Morand asked nothing more than this, and there our conversation ended.    Two days elapsed without being marked by any event. Comte Jean had  spent them with much anxiety. He was absent, when, on the third morning,  Henriette came hastily into my room. \"Madame,\" she said, \"the _valet de  chambre_ of the king is in the drawing-room, and inquires if you will  receive him.\"    At this news I was surprised and vexed. M. Lebel took me unawares; my  toilette was not begun. I gave a hasty glance at my mirror, \"Let M.  Lebel come in\"; and M. Lebel, who was on the heels of my maid, entered  instantly. After having saluted me, he said,    \"It is only you, Madame, whom one might thus surprise. Your beauty needs  no ornament, your charms are decoration sufficient.\"    I replied to this compliment with (of course) much modesty, according  to custom. We entered into conversation, and I found that Lebel  really thought me the sister-in-law of comte Jean; and I remarked the  involuntary respect that attended even his familiarity. I left him in  his error, which was material to my interests. He talked to me some time  of my attractions, of the part which a female like myself might assume  in France. But fearing to compromise myself, I made no reply, but  preserved the reserve which my character imposed upon me. I am not  clever, my friend, I never could conduct an intrigue: I feared to speak  or do wrong; and whilst I kept a tranquil appearance, I was internally  agitated at the absence of comte Jean.    Fortune sent him to me. He was passing the street, when he saw at our  door a carriage with the royal livery. Lebel always used it when his  affairs did not demand a positive incognito. This equipage made him  suspect a visit from Lebel, and he came in opportunely to extricate me  from my embarrassment.    \"Sir,\" said Lebel to him, when he entered, \"here is the lady whose  extreme modesty refuses to listen to what I dare not thus explain to  her.\"    \"Is it anything I may hear for her?\" said the comte, with a smiling air.    \"Yes, I am the ambassador of a mighty power: you are the minister  plenipotentiary of the lady, and with your leave, we will go into your  private room to discuss the articles of the secret treaty which I have  been charged to propose to you. What says madame?\"    \"I consent to anything that may come from such an ambassador.\"    Comte Jean instantly led him into another room, and when they were  alone, Lebel said to him, \"Do you know that your sister-in-law is a most  fascinating creature? She has occupied my thoughts since I have known  her, and in my enthusiasm I could not help speaking of her in a certain  quarter. So highly have I eulogized her, that his majesty desires an  interview with her, that he may judge with his own eyes if I am an  appreciator of beauty.\"    At these words comte Jean felt a momentary agitation, but soon  recovering himself, he replied:    \"I am exceedingly obliged to you, sir, for the favorable disposition  you have evinced towards the comtesse du Barry. She and I have as much  respect as love for his majesty; but my sister-in-law has not been  presented, and, consequently, I can scarcely see how she can be allowed  to pay her respects to his majesty.\"    \"Do not let that disturb you; it is not intended that she shall go  and partake of the magnificence of Versailles, but be admitted to  an intimacy much more flattering. Would you refuse to grant him that  pleasure?\"    \"It would be a crime of _lese-majeste _,\" said the comte Jean, laughing,  \"and my family have too much respect for their monarch. We should not be  content with a fugitive favor.\"    \"You may expect everything from the charms of the comtesse; I am  certain they will have the utmost success; but for me, I can give you no  guarantee. You must run the chance.\"    \"Your protection, however, is the only thing which encourages my  sister-in-law in this affair. But tell me when is this meeting to take  place?\"    \"Instantly. The king is impatient to see the comtesse and I have  promised that she will sup with him to-morrow evening in my apartment at  Versailles.\"    \"How is she to be introduced to the king?\"    \"I am to entertain four of my friends.\"    \"Who are they?\"    \"'First, the baron de Gonesse.\"    \"Who is he?\"    \"The king himself.\"    \"Well, who next?\"    \"The duc de Richelieu.\"    \"Who else?\"    \"The marquis de Chauvelin.\"    \"Well?\"    \"The duc de la Vauguyon.\"    \"What, the devotee?\"    \"The hypocrite. But never mind: the main point is, that you must not  appear to recognize the king. Instruct your sister-in-law to this  effect.\"    \"Certainly; if she must sin, she had better do so with some reason.\"    While these gentlemen were thus disposing of me, what was I doing?  Alone, in my room, I waited the result of their conference with mortal  impatience. The character I had to play was a superb one, and at the  moment was about to enter on the stage, I felt all the difficulties  of my part. I feared I should not succeed, but fail amid the insulting  hisses of the Versailles party.    My fears at once disappeared, and then I pictured myself sitting on  a throne, magnificently attired; my imagination wandered in all the  enchantments of greatness;--then, as if from remorse, I recalled my past  life. The former lover of Nicholas blushed before the future mistress of  Louis XV. A thousand different reflections crowded upon me, and mingled  in my brain. If to live is to think, I lived a whole age in one quarter  of an hour. At length I heard some doors open, a carriage rolled away,  and comte Jean entered my chamber.    \"Victory!\" cried he, embracing me with transport. \"Victory! my dear  Jeanne, to-morrow you sup with the king.\"    On this information I turned pale, my strength forsook me, and I was  compelled to sit down, or rather to fall into a chair; for, according  to Jean Jacques Rousseau, my legs shook under me (_flageolaient_). This,  however, was the only movement of weakness which I betrayed. When I  recovered a little, the comte Jean told me the conversation he had had  with Lebel. I joked about the title of baron de Gonesse, and I promised  to treat the king as if ignorant of his incognito. One thing only made  me uneasy, and that was supping with the duc de Richelieu, who had  seen me before at madame de Lagarde's; but the idea that he would not  remember me gave me renewed courage.    On so important an occasion, comte Jean did not forget to repeat his  instructions over again. These are nearly his words, for I think I  learnt them by heart.    \"Remember that it is on your first interview that your safety depends.  Let him learn, through you, those utter tendernesses which have been  sought for him in vain heretofore. He is like the monarch of old, who  was willing to pay the half of his crown for an unknown pleasure. Lebel  is wearied in seeking every week for new fruit. He is quite disposed  to serve you, and will second you in the best manner. You are about  to become the centre of attraction to all courtiers, and noble  _courtisanes_. You must expect that they will endeavor to cry you down,  because you will have carried off from them a gem to which every family  has its pretensions. You must at first stand firmly before the storm,  but afterward you will find all enlist themselves under your banner, who  have no wife, sister, nor daughter; that is, all who have no mistress to  offer to the king. You must attach these to you by place and favor: they  must be first thought of, and then you must think of yourself and me, my  dear girl.\"    \"All this is well enough,\" I replied, \"but as yet I am nothing.\"    \"_Morbleu_! to-morrow you will be everything,\" cried comte Jean, with  his determined energy. \"But we must think about this morrow. Make haste,  noble comtesse; go to all the milliners, seek what is elegant rather  than what is rich. Be as lovely, pleasing, and gay as possible; this is  the main point, and God will do all the rest.\"    He pronounced this blasphemy in a laughing tone, and I confess I could  not help joining in the laugh, and then hastened to comply with his  directions.

The sea upon which, trusting to the favorable influence  of my leading star, we were about to venture, was filled with rocks and  shoals which threatened the poor mariner who should direct his bark near  them. In the first place, I had to dread my obscure birth, as well as  the manner in which my life had been passed; and still more had I to  fear the indifferent reputation of comte Jean. There was more than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25646"],[0,"Child's Health Primer For Primary Classes (#5)"],[1,",  rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol.    A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure  any one more, and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or beer.    But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often drinks so much more of the  weaker liquor, that he gets a great deal of alcohol. People are often  made drunkards by drinking cider or beer. The more poison, the more  danger.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. Where have you ever seen distilling going on?              2. How can you distill water?              3. How can men separate alcohol from wine or from            any other liquor that contains it?              4. Why will not this be pure alcohol?              5. How is a liquor made stronger?              6. Name some of the distilled liquors.              7. How are they made?              8. How much of them is alcohol?              9. Which is the most harmful--the distilled            liquor, or beer, wine, or cider?              10. Why does the wine, cider, or beer-drinker            often get as much alcohol?          CHAPTER VII.    ALCOHOL.      [Illustration: A]LCOHOL looks like water, but it is not at all like  water.    Alcohol will take fire, and burn if a lighted match is held near it; but  you know that water will not burn.    When alcohol burns, the color of the flame is blue. It does not give  much light: it makes no smoke or soot; but it does give a great deal of  heat.    A little dead tree-toad was once put into a bottle of alcohol. It was  years ago, but the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it did the  first day it was put in. What has kept it so?    It is the alcohol. The tree-toad would have soon decayed if it had been  put into water. So you see that alcohol keeps dead bodies from  decaying.    Pure alcohol is not often used as a drink. People who take beer, wine,  and cider get a little alcohol with each drink. Those who drink brandy,  rum, whiskey, or gin, get more alcohol, because those liquors are nearly  one half alcohol.    You may wonder that people wish to use such poisonous drinks at all. But  alcohol is a deceiver. It often cheats the man who takes a little, into  thinking it will be good for him to take more.    Sometimes the appetite which begs so hard for the poison, is formed in  childhood. If you eat wine-jelly, or wine-sauce, you may learn to like  the taste of alcohol and thus easily begin to drink some weak liquor.    The more the drinker takes, the more he often wants, and thus he goes on  from drinking cider, wine, or beer, to drinking whiskey, brandy, or rum.  Thus drunkards are made.    People who are in the habit of taking drinks which contain alcohol,  often care more for them than for any thing else, even when they know  they are being ruined by them.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. How does alcohol look?              2. How does alcohol burn?              3. What will alcohol do to a dead body?              4. What drinks contain a little alcohol?              5. What drinks are about one half alcohol?              6. How does alcohol cheat people?              7. When is the appetite sometimes formed?              8. Why should you not eat wine-sauce or            wine-jelly?              9. How are drunkards made?          CHAPTER VIII.    TOBACCO.      [Illustration: A] FARMER who had been in the habit of planting his  fields with corn, wheat, and potatoes, once made up his mind to plant  tobacco instead.    Let us see whether he did any good to the world by the change.    The tobacco plants grew up as tall as a little boy or girl, and spread  out broad, green leaves.    By and by he pulled the stalks, and dried the leaves. Some of them he  pressed into cakes of tobacco; some he rolled into cigars; and some he  ground into snuff.    If you ask what tobacco is good for, the best answer will be, to tell  you what it will do to a man or boy who uses it, and then let you answer  the question for yourselves.    Tobacco contains something called nicotine (n[)i]k'o t[)i]n). This is a  strong poison. One drop of it is enough to kill a dog. In one cigar  there is enough, if taken pure, to kill two men.    [Illustration]    Even to work upon tobacco, makes people pale and sickly. Once I went  into a snuff mill, and the man who had the care of it showed me how the  work was done.    The mill stood in a pretty place, beside a little stream which turned  the mill-wheel. Tall trees bent over it, and a fresh breeze was blowing  through the open windows. Yet the smell of the tobacco was so strong  that I had to go to the door many times, for a breath of pure air.    I asked the man if it did not make him sick to work there.    He said: \"It made me very sick for the first few weeks. Then I began to  get used to it, and now I don't mind it.\"    He was like the boys who try to learn to smoke. It almost always makes  them sick at first; but they think it will be manly to keep on. At last,  they get used to it.    The sickness is really the way in which the boy's body is trying to say  to him: \"There is danger here; you are playing with poison. Let me stop  you before great harm is done.\"    Perhaps you will say: \"I have seen men smoke cigars, even four or five  in a day, and it didn't kill them.\"    It did not kill them, because they did not swallow the nicotine. They  only drew in a little with the breath. But taking a little poison in  this way, day after day, can not be safe, or really helpful to any one.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. What did the farmer plant instead of corn,            wheat, and potatoes?              2. What was done with the tobacco leaves?              3. What is the name of the poison which is in            tobacco?              4. How much of it is needed to kill a dog?              5. What harm can the nicotine in one cigar do, if            taken pure?              6. Tell the story of the visit to the snuff mill.              7. Why are boys made sick by their first use of            tobacco?              8. Why does not smoking a cigar kill a man?              9. What is said about a little poison?          CHAPTER IX.    OPIUM.      [Illustration: A]LCOHOL and tobacco are called narcotics (nar  k[)o]t'iks). This means that they have the power of putting the nerves  to sleep. Opium ([=o]'p[)i] [)u]m) is another narcotic.    It is a poison made from the juice of poppies, and is used in medicines.    Opium is put into soothing-syrups (s[)i]r'[)u]ps), and these are  sometimes given to babies to keep them from crying. They do this by  injuring the tender nerves and poisoning the little body.    How can any one give a baby opium to save taking patient care of it?    Surely the mothers would not do it, if they knew that this  soothing-syrup that appears like a friend, coming to quiet and comfort  the baby, is really an enemy.    [Illustration: _Don't give soothing-syrup to children._]    Sometimes, a child no older than some of you are, is left at home with  the care of a baby brother or sister; so it is best that you should know  about this dangerous enemy, and never be tempted to quiet the baby by  giving him a poison, instead of taking your best and kindest care of  him.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1. What is a narcotic?              2. Name three narcotics?              3. From what is opium made?              4. For what is it used?              5. Why is soothing-syrup dangerous?          CHAPTER X.    WHAT ARE ORGANS?      [Illustration: A]N organ is a part of the body which has some special  work to do. The eye is the organ of sight. The stomach (st[)u]m'[)a]k)  is an organ which takes care of the food we eat.      THE TEETH.    [Illustration: _Different kinds of teeth._]    Your teeth do not look alike, since they must do different kinds of  work. The front ones cut, the back ones grind.    They are made of a kind of bone covered with a hard smooth enamel ([)e]n  [)a]m'el). If the enamel is broken, the teeth soon decay and ache, for  each tooth is furnished with a nerve that very quickly feels pain.      CARE OF THE TEETH.    Cracking nuts with the teeth, or even biting thread, is apt to break the  enamel; and when once broken, you will wish in vain to have it mended.  The dentist can fill a hole in the tooth; but he can not cover the tooth  with new enamel.    Bits of food should be carefully picked from between the teeth with a  tooth-pick of quill or wood, never with a pin or other hard and sharp  thing which might break the enamel.    The teeth must also be well brushed. Nothing but perfect cleanliness  will keep them in good order. Always brush them before breakfast. Your  breakfast will taste all the better for it. Brush them at night before  you go to bed, lest some food should be decaying in your mouth during  the night.    Take care of these cutters and grinders, that they may not decay, and so  be unable to do their work well.      THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN.    You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and  the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone.    These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony  case or box.    In it are some of the most useful organs of the body.    This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may  say it is two stories high.    The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b  d[=o]'m[)e]n).    In the chest, are the heart and the lungs.    In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs.      THE STOMACH.    The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you  will say, when I tell you what it can do.    The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called  gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.    Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and  apples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up"]]]
