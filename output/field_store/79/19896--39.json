There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt  like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.    The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of  them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto,  not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.    \"Remember,\" he was saying, \"the facts about this church of Santa Croce;  how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before  any taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these  frescoes--now, unhappily, ruined by restoration--is untroubled by the  snares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic, more  pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge and  technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!\"    \"No!\" exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.  \"Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means  the workmen weren't paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no  truth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I  do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.\"    He was referring to the fresco of the \"Ascension of St. John.\" Inside,  the lecturer's voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted  uneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with  these men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and  so strange that she could not remember how to behave.    \"Now, did this happen, or didn't it? Yes or no?\"    George replied:    \"It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to  heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should  like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.\"    \"You will never go up,\" said his father. \"You and I, dear boy, will  lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as  surely as our work survives.\"    \"Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever  he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at all.\"    \"Pardon me,\" said a frigid voice. \"The chapel is somewhat small for two  parties. We will incommode you no longer.\"    The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,  for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They  filed out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little old  ladies of the Pension Bertolini--Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.    \"Stop!\" cried Mr. Emerson. \"There's plenty of room for us all. Stop!\"    The procession disappeared without a word.    Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life  of St. Francis.    \"George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.\"    George went into the next chapel and returned, saying \"Perhaps he is. I  don't remember.\"    \"Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It's that Mr.  Eager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go  and say we are sorry. Hadn't I better? Then perhaps he will come back.\"    \"He will not come back,\" said George.    But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the  Rev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear  the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old  man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every  little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.    \"My father has that effect on nearly everyone,\" he informed her. \"He  will try to be kind.\"    \"I hope we all try,\" said she, smiling nervously.    \"Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people  because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or  frightened.\"    \"How silly of them!\" said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; \"I  think that a kind action done tactfully--\"    \"Tact!\"    He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong  answer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.  For a young man his face was rugged, and--until the shadows fell upon  it--hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again  at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of  acorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,  of tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon  passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born  of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,  and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar  to her.    \"Were you snubbed?\" asked his son tranquilly.    \"But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don't know how many people. They  won't come back.\"    \"...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in  others...vision of the brotherhood of man...\" Scraps of the lecture on  St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.    \"Don't let us spoil yours,\" he continued to Lucy. \"Have you looked at  those saints?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lucy. \"They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone  that is praised in Ruskin?\"    He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it. George,  rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered  not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn,  has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were also  beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady  with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his  Mass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half  interested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had  impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.    \"Why will he look at that fresco?\" he said uneasily. \"I saw nothing in  it.\"    \"I like Giotto,\" she replied. \"It is so wonderful what they say about  his tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies  better.\"    \"So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby's worth the  whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.\"    Lucy again felt that this did not do.    \"In Hell,\" he repeated. \"He's unhappy.\"    \"Oh, dear!\" said Lucy.    \"How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one  to give him? And think how he has been brought up--free from all the  superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name  of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow  up happy.\"    She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old  man, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother  might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte  would object most strongly.    \"What are we to do with him?\" he asked. \"He comes out for his holiday to  Italy, and behaves--like that; like the little child who ought to have  been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What did you  say?\"    Lucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:    \"Now don't be stupid over this. I don't require you to fall in love with  my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are nearer  his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible. You  might help me. He has known so few women, and you have the time.  You stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are  inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself  go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,  and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By  understanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be  good for both of you.\"    To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.    \"I only know what it is that's wrong with him; not why it is.\"    \"And what is it?\" asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.    \"The old trouble; things won't fit.\"    \"What things?\"    \"The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don't.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?\"    In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting  poetry, he said:      \"'From far, from eve and morning,     And yon twelve-winded sky,     The stuff of life to knit me     Blew hither: here am I'    George and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that  we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life  is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But  why should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and  work and rejoice. I don't believe in this world sorrow.\"    Miss Honeychurch assented.    \"Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of  the everlasting Why there is a Yes--a transitory Yes if you like, but a  Yes.\"    Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy  because the universe wouldn't fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,  or a Yes, or something!    \"I'm very sorry,\" she cried. \"You'll think me unfeeling, but--but--\"  Then she became matronly. \"Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no  particular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget  them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my  brother. Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the  Lakes.\"    The old man's face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.  This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him  and that he was thanking her for it. Indeed, he no longer alarmed her  at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings  were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,  before she lost Baedeker.

Schirach's History of Bees, in a memoir by M. Hattorf,  entitled, _Physical Researches whether the Queen Bee requires  fecundation by Drones?_    {E} It will afterwards appear that what we took for the generative  fluid, was the male organs of generation, left by copulation in the body  of the female. This discovery we owe to a circumstance that shall  immediately be related. Perhaps I should avoid prolixity, by suppressing  all my first observations on the impregnation of the queen, and by  passing directly to the experiments that prove she carries away the  genital organs; but in such observations which are both new and  delicate, and where it is so easy to be deceived, I think service is  done to the reader by a candid avowal of my errors. This is an  additional proof to so many others, of the absolute necessity that an  observer should repeat all his experiments a thousand times, to obtain  the certainty of seeing facts as they really exist.          LETTER II.    _SEQUEL OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE IMPREGNATION OF THE QUEEN BEE._        SIR,    All the experiments, related in my preceding letter, were made in 1787  and 1788. They seem to establish two facts, which had previously been  the subject of vague conjecture: 1. The queen bee is not impregnated of  herself, but is fecundated by copulation with the male. 2. Copulation is  accomplished without the hive, and in the air.    The latter appeared so extraordinary, that notwithstanding all the  evidence obtained of it, we eagerly desired to take the queen in the  fact; but, as she always rises to a great height, we never could see  what passed. On that account you advised us to cut part off the wings of  virgin queens. We endeavoured to benefit by your advice, in every  possible manner; but to our great regret, when the wings lost much, the  bees could no longer fly; and, by cutting off only an inconsiderable  portion, we did not diminish the rapidity of their flight. Probably  there is a medium, but we were unable to attain it. On your suggestion,  we tried to render their vision less acute, by covering the eyes with an  opaque varnish, which was an experiment equally fruitless.    We likewise attempted artificial fecundation, and took every possible  precaution to insure success. Yet the result was always unsatisfactory.  Several queens were the victims of our curiosity; and those surviving  remained sterile. Though these different experiments were unsuccessful,  it was proved that queens leave their hives to seek the males, and that  they return with undoubted evidence of fecundation. Satisfied with this,  we could only trust to time or accident for decisive proof of an actual  copulation. We were far from suspecting a most singular discovery, which  we made in July this year, and which affords complete demonstration of  the supposed event, namely, that the sexual organs of the male remain  with the female.{F}      FOOTNOTES:    {F} The remainder of this Chapter chiefly consists of anatomical  details. These may rather be considered an interruption of the  narrative; and the Translator has judged it expedient to transfer them  to an Appendix.          LETTER III.    _THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.--OBSERVATIONS ON RETARDING THE FECUNDATION  OF QUEENS._      In my first letter, I remarked, that when queens were prevented from  receiving the approaches of the male until the twenty-fifth or thirtieth  day of their existence, the result presented very interesting  peculiarities. My experiments at that time were not sufficiently  numerous; but they have since been so often repeated, and the result so  uniform, that I no longer hesitate to announce, as a certain discovery,  the singularities which retarded fecundation, produces on the ovaries of  the queen. If she receives the male during the first fifteen days of her  life, she remains capable of laying both the eggs of workers and of  drones; but should fecundation be retarded until the twenty-second day,  her ovaries are vitiated in such a manner that she becomes unfit for  laying the eggs of workers, and will produce only those of drones.    In June 1787, being occupied in researches relative to the formation of  swarms, I had occasion, for the first time, to observe a queen that laid  none but the eggs of males. When a hive is ready to swarm, I had before  observed, that the moment of swarming is always preceded by a very  lively agitation, which first affects the queen, is then communicated to  the workers, and excites such a tumult among them, that they abandon  their labours, and rush in disorder to the outlets of the hive. I then  knew very well the cause of the queen's agitation, and it is described  in the history of swarms, but I was ignorant how the delirium  communicated to the workers; and this difficulty interrupted my  researches. I therefore thought of investigating, by direct experiments,  whether at all times, when the queen was greatly agitated, even not in  the time of the hive swarming, her agitation would in like manner be  communicated to the workers. The moment a queen was hatched, I confined  her to the hive by contracting the entrances. When assailed by the  imperious desire of union with the males, I could not doubt that she  would make great exertions to escape, and that the impossibility of it  would produce a kind of delirium. I had the patience to observe this  queen thirty-four days. Every morning about eleven o'clock, when the  weather was fine and the sunshine invited the males to leave their  hives, I saw her impetuously traverse every corner of her habitation,  seeking to escape. Her fruitless efforts threw her into an uncommon  agitation, the symptoms of which I shall elsewhere describe, and all the  common bees were affected by it. As she never was out all this time, she  could not be impregnated. At length, on the thirty-sixth day, I set her  at liberty. She soon took advantage of it; and was not long of returning  with the most evident marks of fecundation.    Satisfied with the particular object of this experiment, I was far from  any hopes that it would lead to the knowledge of another very remarkable  fact; how great was my astonishment, therefore, on finding that this  female, which, as usual, began to lay forty-six hours after copulation,  laid the eggs of drones, but none of workers, and that she continued  ever afterwards to lay those of drones only.    At first, I exhausted myself with conjectures on this singular fact; the  more I reflected on it, the more did it seem inexplicable. At length, by  attentively meditating on the circumstances of the experiment it  appeared there were two principles, the influence of which I should  first of all endeavour to appreciate separately. On the one hand, this  queen had suffered long confinement; on the other, her fecundation had  been extremely retarded. You know, Sir, that queens generally receive  the males about the fifth or sixth day, and this queen had not copulated  until the thirty-sixth. Little weight could be given to the supposition,  that the peculiarity could be occasioned by confinement. Queens, in the  natural state, leave their hives only once to seek the males. All the  rest of their "]]]
