The day of the month  unknown--I do not think it matters, in such notes as these, dates are  rather like ruled lines on sketching paper, only distracting.... We have  had such a pleasant time so far, that a Presbyterian lady was quite  surprised when at breakfast I told her the day of the week, as she had  not heard any clanging and clashing of bells, and as everybody seemed  quite cheerful and there were no black clothes, she could not realise it  was Sunday. But this afternoon it is not joyful for all! There is a  solemn grey sky sweeping over us from Spain, with a grandeur and breadth  that one only associates with Spanish skies, and there is a fresh  breeze, but warm from the land, and this big tub moves a little, enough  to make one realise the Sea is alive, her bosom heaves us along  slightly, a delightful motion for some of us, and intensely soothing,  but alas! there are empty places at our board. What a penance it is this  sea-sickness. In the words of Burns,        \"It is a dizziness,      That will not let a body gang      About his business\"    at all, at all.... I was a pale-faced student, a week out from Leith to  Antwerp, when I first felt this rudeness: we struck a fog-bank off St.  Abb's Head to begin with, and a sand-bank off Middlesborough, and  listened there to the cocks crowing on shore without seeing a foot ahead  for the thickness of the grey, wet mist. We cheered ourselves with  bagpipes, and the captain had a case of the very best brandy, the first  I think I ever tasted; and he could play some tunes on the practise  chanter. \"Dinna think bonnie lassie, I'm goin' to leave you,\" I remember  was his best; it is a strathspey tune; I learned it from him. The  trouble came when it blew up hard off the Scheldt; but even when coming  over the bar, the \"romance\" of the sea qualified its pains a little. I  can feel the cold in my hands to-day of the barrels of the Winchesters  at the side of the couch, and to which I clung in my hour of trial, and  remembered they had been used in the steamer's very last trip against  _Real Pirates_ in the China Seas! And certainly there was the \"romance\"  of the sea in the change from the gale and black night outside the bar,  to the quiet morning on the wide river with the cathedral spire, violet  against the sunrise, dropping its silvery music \"from heaven like dew;\"  \"Madame Angot,\" was the tune I think, with a note missing here and  there.    We saw a number of sea birds to-day, and two at least were skuas, black  looking thieves among their white cousins. I saw one try to make a gull  disgorge, driving up at it from below, to the gull's loudly-expressed  disgust. It is a strange arrangement of nature, and I can't understand  why a few gulls don't combine to defend themselves. I am sure each of  them must hate to give up the little meal they have earned with so much  tiring flight. There were shore birds too; we shipped some as  passengers, they were going south like ourselves, but by instinct not by  the card. I suppose they were on the road all right, and just needed to  rest their wings a little; two large black birds were on the bridge last  night, possibly crows, and we have starlings to-day, and I saw some  finches of sorts. At least one of these fragile boarders was eaten by  the ship's cat--I found its delicate remains, a few tiny feathers and a  dainty wing and its poor head.    The land is very faint on the horizon and the breeze is just going  down, such as it was; it's a momentary interest at the end of a somewhat  dull, grey day to most passengers.    R. and his wife, since one A.M., have had rather a poor time; their  cabin is far forward, and so they feel any motion more than we do  amidships; what with a little sea-sickness and the anchor chain loose in  its pipe, banging against their bunks, they had a disturbed night. We  raked out the bo'sun from his afternoon nap, and he and a withered old  lascar jammed a hemp fender between the chain and woodwork, so their  slumbers ought to be more peaceful; now they are getting a temporary  change to a berth amidship, which is unoccupied as far as Marseilles; in  it they will hardly feel the motion.    It was really considerate of the captain making a break in a dull, damp  Sunday afternoon--the horn went booming, and up we all jumped in the  smoking-room with some idea that someone had gone overboard, and up on  deck came the lascars grinning, a jolly string of colour, and away  forward they trotted and climbed into the forward life-boats from the  deck above us. It was very smartly done, but I would like to have seen  if their feet could reach the stretchers or their hands the oars; the  boats were not swung out, but everything seemed ready. I think my friend  the bo'sun must have had an inkling they were needed for he was working  about the davits and falls earlier in the afternoon. In the words of the  poet, Gilbert,                \"It is little I know,      Of the ways of men of the sea,      But I'll eat my hand if I (don't) understand\"    this part of their business; practice on a whaler tends to perfection at  getting away in the boats, and at getting on board again too, if you are  hungry--and faith if it isn't snowing it is fun!    To night the air is damp and warm from the S.E., and we smell  Spain--true bill--several of us noticed the aromatic smell. Scents at  sea carry great distances. \"I know a man\" who smelt burning wood or  heather, 250 nautical miles from land, and said so and was laughed at;  but he laughed last, for two or three days after his vessel beat up to  some islands, from which towered a vast column of brown and white smoke  from burning peat, and this floated south on a frosty northerly breeze,  and the chart showed the smoke was dead to windward at the time he  spoke.          CHAPTER III      MONDAY--a rolling tumbling sea, soft grey and white, and misty-wet decks  with shimmering reflections--a day when even a great liner such as this  feels a little shut off from the outside world, for the mist comes down  on the edge of the horizon and hedges us in. If I ever paint Orpheus or  the Sirens, I will use such a grey wet effect. I think of these old  navigators in their small vessels, getting the thick and the thin, just  as we do to-day in our own sailing craft; getting well dusted at times,  with the salt thick on their cheeks and decks. Taking it all round, the  sea is rather a minor chord; so that these Burlington House pictures of  the Argo and The Heroes, in orange and rose on a wine-red sea are not  convincing. When my patron comes home I will humbly suggest Orpheus  singing at the stem, a following wind, a great bellying sail behind, and  all around wet air and splashing grey sea, the stem ploughing it up  silver and white and green, and away aft under the bend of the sail  there would be Jason and the steersman, possibly Medea, with the curl  out of her hair, and perhaps just a touch of the golden fleece, just a  fleck of pale yellow to enliven the minor tints! Round the bows there  would be men listening to the song, watching the stem pound into the  green hollows--now, I remember! I have seen this--I'd forgotten. But the  Orpheus was in faded blue dungarees, and played a fiddle, and leaned  against a rusty, red capstan--saw it from the jib-boom of the  Mjolna[2]--fishing bonita--looked back, and there they all were, the  same to-day as they were in olden days, I expect, men and boys, salt  and sun-bitten sea-farers, lolling on the cat-heads and anchors. A joy  of the World, that is--from your perch out on the jib-boom to watch a  ship with its cloud of white sails surging after you.    [2] Norse for Thors hammer.    [Illustration]    The Sirens too would paint in this weather; they look quite dry in  pictures, they would look better wet--I'd have them glittering wet and  joyous, and a fit carvel built boat and crew, and brown sloping sails,  three reefs down, making a fine passage clear on to them, just as the  steersman might wish with no bindings or wax in ears at all, but all at  the Sirens' service.    St. Vincent light is now in sight--the swell from the south-west, and  our course, as far as a passenger may guess, will soon be south by east;  so we ought to have a fair roll on soon, and I feel glad our sea-sick  friends are mostly asleep. To-morrow we hope to be in early at  Gibraltar, then they will have a rest--it will be all smooth sailing.  \"They say so--and they hope so,\" as the \"Old Horse\" Chantie puts it. Is  there not a wind, however, called the Mistral, in the Gulf of Lyons,  and a Euroclydon further east, mentioned by St Paul?    We passed some rather interesting land scenery this afternoon, before we  came to the mouth of the Tagus; you could see houses, comfortably  nestled up the sides of the hills. At the foot of the red cliffs there  is a line of green water and white bursts of foam--made a pochade of a  bit of this coast--a castle perched on blue peaks, a rolling sky and  rugged mountains, and nearer, a rolling, leaden-coloured swell.    [Illustration]    From the well or waist where I paint, I noticed a rather black,  white-man stood and watched me out of the engine room. He looked  interested, and I spoke to him later. He said he \"did a bit\" himself in  unmistakeable West Country accent, and he took me to his cabin to show  me his art work. Though not very high up in the working part of this  show--boiler maker or artificer, I think, he had a very nice cabin. His  art work was decorative. He applied various cigar and tobacco labels  with gum to Eastern wine jars of unmistakeably Greek design, also  Masonic, and P. & O. symbols, with crosses, and rising suns in red and  gold; the interspaces of these geometric designs he filled up with blue  and gold enamel paint; and the general effect was very bright. It was  odd though to see a vase of historic shape done"]]]
