But D'Artagnan's suspicions were aroused,  and when once that was the case, D'Artagnan could not sleep or remain  quiet for a moment. He was among men what the cat is among quadrupeds,  the emblem of anxiety and impatience, at the same moment. A restless cat  can no more remain the same place than a silk thread wafted idly to and  fro with every breath of air. A cat on the watch is as motionless as  death stationed at its place of observation, and neither hunger nor  thirst can draw it from its meditations. D'Artagnan, who was burning  with impatience, suddenly threw aside the feeling, like a cloak which  he felt too heavy on his shoulders, and said to himself that that which  they were concealing from him was the very thing it was important he  should know; and, consequently, he reasoned that Baisemeaux would not  fail to put Aramis on his guard, if Aramis had given him any particular  recommendation, and this was, in fact, the very thing that happened.    Baisemeaux had hardly had time to return from the donjon, than  D'Artagnan placed himself in ambuscade close to the Rue de Petit-Musc,  so as to see every one who might leave the gates of the Bastile. After  he had spent an hour on the look-out from the \"Golden Portcullis,\" under  the pent-house of which he could keep himself a little in the shade,  D'Artagnan observed a soldier leave the Bastile. This was, indeed, the  surest indication he could possibly have wished for, as every jailer  or warder has certain days, and even certain hours, for leaving the  Bastile, since all are alike prohibited from having either wives or  lodgings in the castle, and can accordingly leave without exciting any  curiosity; but a soldier once in barracks is kept there for four and  twenty hours when on duty,--and no one knew this better than D'Artagnan.  The guardsman in question, therefore, was not likely to leave his  regimentals, except on an express and urgent order. The soldier, we  were saying, left the Bastile at a slow and lounging pace, like a happy  mortal, in fact, who, instead of mounting sentry before a wearisome  guard-house, or upon a bastion no less wearisome, has the good luck  to get a little liberty, in addition to a walk--both pleasures being  luckily reckoned as part of his time on duty. He bent his steps towards  the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, enjoying the fresh air and the warmth of the  sun, and looking at all the pretty faces he passed. D'Artagnan followed  him at a distance; he had not yet arranged his ideas as what was to be  done. \"I must, first of all,\" he thought, \"see the fellow's face. A man  seen is a man judged.\" D'Artagnan increased his pace, and, which was not  very difficult, by the by, soon got in advance of the soldier. Not only  did he observe that his face showed a tolerable amount of intelligence  and resolution, but he noticed also that his nose was a little red. \"He  has a weakness for brandy, I see,\" said D'Artagnan to himself. At the  same moment that he remarked his red nose, he saw that the soldier had a  white paper in his belt.    \"Good, he has a letter,\" added D'Artagnan. The only difficulty was to  get hold of the letter. But a common soldier would, of course, be only  too delighted at having been selected by M. de Baisemeaux as a special  messenger, and would not be likely to sell his message. As D'Artagnan  was biting his nails, the soldier continued to advance more and more  into the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. \"He is certainly going to Saint-Mande,\"  he said to himself, \"and I shall not be able to learn what the letter  contains.\" It was enough to drive him wild. \"If I were in uniform,\" said  D'Artagnan to himself, \"I would have this fellow seized, and his letter  with him. I could easily get assistance at the very first guard-house;  but the devil take me if I mention my name in an affair of this kind.  If I were to treat him to something to drink, his suspicions would be  roused; and besides, he might drink me drunk. _Mordioux!_ my wits  seem to have left me,\" said D'Artagnan; \"it is all over with me. Yet,  supposing I were to attack this poor devil, make him draw his sword  and kill him for the sake of his letter? No harm in that, if it were  a question of a letter from a queen to a nobleman, or a letter from a  cardinal to a queen; but what miserable intrigues are those of Messieurs  Aramis and Fouquet with M. Colbert. A man's life for that? No, no,  indeed; not even ten crowns.\" As he philosophized in this manner, biting  first his nails, and then his mustaches, he perceived a group of archers  and a commissary of the police engaged in carrying away a man of very  gentlemanly exterior, who was struggling with all his might against  them. The archers had torn his clothes, and were dragging him roughly  away. He begged they would lead him along more respectfully, asserting  that he was a gentleman and a soldier. And observing our soldier walking  in the street, he called out, \"Help, comrade.\"    The soldier walked on with the same step towards the man who had  called out to him, followed by the crowd. An idea suddenly occurred to  D'Artagnan; it was his first one, and we shall find it was not a bad one  either. During the time the gentleman was relating to the soldier that  he had just been seized in a house as a thief, when the truth was he  was only there as a lover; and while the soldier was pitying him, and  offering him consolation and advice with that gravity which a French  soldier has always ready whenever his vanity or his _esprit de corps_ is  concerned, D'Artagnan glided behind the soldier, who was closely hemmed  in by the crowd, and with a rapid sweep, like a sabre slash, snatched  the letter from his belt. As at this moment the gentleman with the torn  clothes was pulling about the soldier, to show how the commissary of  police had pulled him about, D'Artagnan effected his pillage of the  letter without the slightest interference. He stationed himself about  ten paces distant, behind the pillar of an adjoining house, and read  on the address, \"To Monsieur du Vallon, at Monsieur Fouquet's,  Saint-Mande.\"    \"Good!\" he said, and then he unsealed, without tearing the letter,  drew out the paper, which was folded in four, from the inside; which  contained only these words:    \"DEAR MONSIEUR DU VALLON,--Will you be good enough to tell Monsieur  d'Herblay that _he_ has been to the Bastile, and has been making  inquiries.    \"Your devoted    \"DE BAISEMEAUX.\"      \"Very good! all right!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan; \"it is clear enough now.  Porthos is engaged in it.\" Being now satisfied of what he wished to  know: \"_Mordioux!_\" thought the musketeer, \"what is to be done with that  poor devil of a soldier? That hot-headed, cunning fellow, De Baisemeaux,  will make him pay dearly for my trick,--if he returns without the  letter, what will they do to him? Besides, I don't want the letter;  when the egg has been sucked, what is the good of the shell?\" D'Artagnan  perceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in  convincing the soldier, and went on their way with the prisoner,  the latter being still surrounded by the crowd, and continuing his  complaints. D'Artagnan advanced into the very middle of the crowd, let  the letter fall, without any one having observed him, and then retreated  rapidly. The soldier resumed his route towards Saint-Mande, his mind  occupied with the gentleman who had implored his protection. Suddenly  he thought of his letter, and, looking at his belt, saw that it was no  longer there. D'Artagnan derived no little satisfaction from his sudden,  terrified cry. The poor soldier in the greatest anguish of mind looked  round him on every side, and at last, about twenty paces behind him,  he perceived the lucky envelope. He pounced on it like a falcon on its  prey. The envelope was certainly a little dirty, and rather crumpled,  but at all events the letter itself was found. D'Artagnan observed that  the broken seal attracted the soldier's attention a good deal, but he  finished apparently by consoling himself, and returned the letter to his  belt. \"Go on,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I have plenty of time before me, so you  may precede me. It appears that Aramis is not in Paris, since Baisemeaux  writes to Porthos. Dear Porthos, how delighted I shall be to see him  again, and to have some conversation with him!\" said the Gascon. And,  regulating his pace according to that of the soldier, he promised  himself to arrive a quarter of an hour after him at M. Fouquet's.        Chapter III. In Which the Reader will be Delighted to Find that Porthos  Has Lost Nothing of His Muscularity.    D'Artagnan had, according to his usual style, calculated that every hour  is worth sixty minutes, and every minute worth sixty seconds. Thanks to  this perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds, he reached the  superintendent's door at the very moment the soldier was leaving it with  his belt empty. D'Artagnan presented himself at the door, which a porter  with a profusely embroidered livery held half opened for him. D'Artagnan  would very much have liked to enter without giving his name, but this  was impossible, and so he gave it. Notwithstanding this concession,  which ought to have removed every difficulty in the way, at least  D'Artagnan thought so, the _concierge_ hesitated; however, at the second  repetition of the title, captain of the king's guards, the _concierge_,  without quite leaving the passage clear for him, ceased to bar it  completely. D'Artagnan understood that orders of the most positive  character had been given. He decided, therefore, to tell a falsehood,--a  circumstance, moreover, which did not seriously affect his peace of  mind, when he saw that beyond the falsehood the safety of the state  itself, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27118"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 2, April 1906 (#5)"],[1,"so long as the  Conservative party was in power, but that nothing good was to be  expected of a Liberal government. Marx was right. Shortly after Most's  arrival in London his paper was seized and he was arrested on the  indictment for inciting to murder because he paid a glowing tribute to  the revolutionists of Russia, who, on the first of March, 1881, executed  Alexander II. He was tried and sentenced to eighteen months'  imprisonment to one of the barbarous English prisons.    Most gradually developed into an Anarchist, representing Communist  Anarchism, the organization of production and consummation, based on  free industrial groups, and which would exclude State and bureaucratic  interference. His ideas were related to those of Kropotkin and Elisee  Reclus. He often assured me that he considered Kropotkin his teacher,  and that he owed much of his mental development to him.    The next aim of the hounded man was America, but it does not appear that  he was followed across the ocean by his lucky star. He soon was made to  feel that free speech and free press in this great republic was but a  myth. Time and again he was arrested, brutally treated by the police,  and sentenced to serve time in the penitentiary. Added to this came the  fearful attacks and misrepresentations of Most and his ideas by the  press, many of the articles making him appear as a wild beast ever  plotting destruction. The last sentence inflicted upon him was after the  Czolgosz act. He was arrested for an article by the Radical Karl  Heinzen, that had been written many years ago and the author of which  had been dead a long time. The article had not the slightest relation to  the act, did not contain a single reference to the conditions of this  country, and treated altogether of European conditions of fifty years  ago. In the face of this sentence one cannot but help think of Tolstoi's  \"Power of Darkness.\" Only the Power of Darkness in the minds of the  judges before whom Most was tried and the newspaper men, who helped in  arousing public opinion against him, were responsible for the sentence  inflicted upon him.    Taking Most's life superficially, it would appear that his road was hard  and thorny, but looking at it from a thorough view point, one will  realize that all his hardships and injustices had made of him a  relentless, uncompromising rebel, who continued to wage war against the  enemies of the people.

Perhaps the great God Pan thought they would be the fittest to handle  the sword, since they are so intimately associated with mental  prostitution.          CIVILIZATION IN AFRICA.      A large, strong man, dressed in a uniform and armed to the teeth,  knocked at the door of a hut on the west coast of Africa.    \"Who are you and what do you want?\" said a voice from the inside.    \"In the name of civilization, open your door or I'll break it down for  you and fill you full of lead.\"    \"But what do you want here?\"    \"My name is Christian Civilization. Don't talk like a fool, you black  brute; what do you suppose I want here but to civilize you and make a  reasonable human being out of you if it is possible.\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"In the first place you must dress yourself like a white man. It is a  shame and disgrace the way you go about. From now on you must wear  underclothing, a pair of pants, vest, coat, plug hat, and a pair of  yellow gloves. I will furnish them to you at reasonable rates.\"    \"What shall I do with them?\"    \"Wear them, of course. You did not expect to eat them, did you? The  first step to civilization is in wearing proper clothes.\"    \"But it is too hot here to wear such garments. I'm not used to them.  I'll perish from the heat. Do you want to murder me?\"    \"Not particularly. But if you do die you will have the satisfaction of  being a martyr to civilization.\"    \"How kind!\"    \"Don't mention it. What do you do for a living?\"    \"When I am hungry I eat a banana; I eat, drink or sleep just as I feel  like it.\"    \"What horrible barbarity! You must settle down to some occupation, my  friend. If you don't it will be my duty to lock you up as a vagrant.\"    \"If I have to follow some occupation I think I'll start a coffee house.  I've got a considerable amount of coffee and sugar stored here and  there.\"    \"Oh, you have, have you? Why, you are not such a hopeless case as I  thought you were. In the first place you want to pay me the sum of fifty  dollars.\"    \"What for?\"    \"As an occupation tax, you ignorant heathen. Do you expect all the  blessings of civilization for nothing?\"    \"But I have no money.\"    \"That makes no difference. I'll take it out in tea and coffee. If you  don't pay up like a Christian man, I'll put you in jail for the rest of  your life.\"    \"What is jail?\"    \"Jail is a progressive word. You must be prepared to make some  sacrifices for civilization, you know.\"    \"What a great and glorious thing is civilization.\"    \"You cannot possibly realize the benefits of it, but you will before I  get through with you, my fine fellow.\"    The unfortunate native took to the woods and has not been seen  since--_Waverly Magazine_.

By MARY HANSEN.           _I come, not with the blaring of trumpet,         To herald the birth of a king;       I come, not with traditional story,         The life of a savior to sing;       I come, not with jests for the silly,         I come, not to worship the strong,       But to question the powers that govern,         To point out a world-old wrong._         _To kiss from the starved lips of childhood         The lies that are sapping its breath,       And brighten the brief cheerless valley         That leads to the darkness of death;       With reason and sympathy blended,         And a hope that all mankind shall see,       Untrammeled by Creed, Law or Custom--         The attainable goal of the Free._          MARRIAGE AND THE HOME.    By JOHN R. CORYELL.      You remember _Punch's_ advice to the young man about to be  married--don't. There is a jest nearly half a century old, and yet ever  fresh and poignant. Why? Can it be that the secret, serious voice of  mankind proclaims the jest truth in masquerade? Can it be that marriage,  as an institution, has indeed proved itself in experience such a  terrible failure?    We worship many fetishes, we of the superior civilization, and the  institution of marriage is the chief of them. Few of us but bow before  that; before that and the home of which it is the foundation. And I know  what scorn and obloquy and denunciation await that man who stands unawed  before it, seeing in it but an ugly little idol. And I guess what will  be dealt out to him who not only refuses to bow the head, but openly  scoffs. And yet I am going to scoff and say ugly words about this fetish  of ours. I am going to say that it represents ignorance, hides and  causes hypocrisy, stands in the way of progress, drags low the standard  of individual excellence, perpetuates many foul practices.    Let me admit at the outset that I recognize in the institution of  marriage a perfectly legitimate result of the working of the law of  evolution. Of course it is; and the same may be said of everything that  exists whether good or evil. Every vile and filthy thing, crime,  disease, misery, are all equally legitimate products of the working of  this law. Evolution is simply the process of the logical working of  things; it explains how things come to be; and there is nothing in the  nature of the law to enable it to give to its results the hall mark of  sterling. A thing is because of something else that was. Marriage is  because of a primeval club. Man craved woman and he procured her.  Considering the beginnings of the institution of marriage, it is  interesting, if nothing more, to consider the efforts of the priest to  give it an attribute of sanctity, to call it a sacrament. In truth,  marriage is the most artificial of the relations which exist in the  social body. It is a device of man at his worst--a mixture of slavery,  savage egotism and priestcraft. It is indicated by nothing in the  physical constitution of either male or female. It is an anomaly; a  contract which can be freely entered into by the most unfit, but which  cannot be broken, though both parties wish it, though absolute unfitness  be patent, though hell on earth be its result. The pretense must be  abandoned that men and women marry in order to reproduce their kind.  Nothing could be less true. Marriage legalizes reproduction, but is not  caused by desire for it. Marriage is the hard and fast tying together of  a man and a woman without the least regard to moral or physiological  conditions. Marriage may be for pecuniary gain, or for social  advancement; it may be at the will of a controlling parent, or, more  commonly for St. Paul's reason, that it is better to marry than to burn;  but never for the reason that the parties to it are fitted to each other  for parenthood. That supreme consideration not only does not enter into  either the preliminary or after-thought of the matter, but is even held  to be an indecent topic of conversation between persons not already  married to each other.    The constituents of the average marriage are a man over-stimulated  sexually by mystery and ignorance, and a woman abnormally undersexed by  the course of self-repression and self-mutilation which have been taught  her from her earliest childhood as necessities of modesty, purity and  virtue. And then out of the carefully cultivated repugnance of the woman  and the savage, exulting, unrelenting passion of the man are produced  children, frequently welcome, seldom premeditated.
