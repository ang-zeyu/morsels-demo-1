[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26656"],[0,"Birds, Illustrated (#5)"],[1,"age.    Grosbeaks belong to a family called Finches. The Sparrows, Buntings,  and Crossbills belong to the same family. It is the largest family  among birds.    You will notice that they all have stout bills. Their food is mostly  grains and their bills are well formed to crush the seeds.    Look at your back numbers of \"BIRDS\" and notice the pictures of the  other Finches I have named. Don't you think Dame Nature is very  generous with her colors sometimes?    Only a few days ago while strolling through the woods with my field  glass, I saw a pretty sight. On one tree I saw a Redheaded Woodpecker,  a Flicker, an Indigo Bunting, and a Rose-Breasted Grosbeak. I thought  then, if we could only have the Evening Grosbeak our group of colors  would be complete.    Have you ever wondered at some birds being so prettily dressed while  others have such dull colors?    Some people say that the birds who do not sing must have bright  feathers to make them attractive. We cannot believe this. Some of our  bright colored birds are sweet singers, and surely many of our dull  colored birds cannot sing very well.    Next month you will see the pictures of several home birds. See if  dull colors have anything to do with sweet song.          THE TURKEY VULTURE.      This bird is found mostly in the southern states. Here he is known by  the more common name of Turkey Buzzard.    He looks like a noble bird but he isn't. While he is well fitted for  flying, and might, if he tried, catch his prey, he prefers to eat dead  animals.    The people down south never think of burying a dead horse or cow. They  just drag it out away from their homes and leave it to the Vultures  who are sure to dispose of it.    It is very seldom that they attack a live animal.    They will even visit the streets of the cities in search of dead  animals for food, and do not show much fear of man. Oftentimes they  are found among the chickens and ducks in the barn-yard, but have  never been known to kill any.    One gentleman who has studied the habits of the Vulture says that  it has been known to suck the eggs of Herons. This is not common,  though. As I said they prefer dead animals for their food and even eat  their own dead.    The Vulture is very graceful while on the wing. He sails along and you  can hardly see his wings move as he circles about looking for food on  the ground below.    Many people think the Vulture looks much like our tame turkey.    If you know of a turkey near by, just compare this picture with it and  you won't think so.    See how chalk-white his bill is. No feathers on his head, but a bright  red skin.    What do you think of the young chick? It doesn't seem as though he  could ever be the large, heavy bird his parent seems to be.    Now turn back to the first page of July \"BIRDS\" and see how he differs  from the Eagle.     [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  TURKEY VULTURE.]          THE TURKEY VULTURE.      Turkey Buzzard is the familiar name applied to this bird, on account  of his remarkable resemblance to our common Turkey. This is the only  respect however, in which they are alike. It inhabits the United  States and British Provinces from the Atlantic to the Pacific, south  through Central and most of South America. Every farmer knows it to  be an industrious scavenger, devouring at all times the putrid or  decomposing flesh of carcasses. They are found in flocks, not only  flying and feeding in company, but resorting to the same spot to  roost; nesting also in communities; depositing their eggs on the  ground, on rocks, or in hollow logs and stumps, usually in thick woods  or in a sycamore grove, in the bend or fork of a stream. The nest is  frequently built in a tree, or in the cavity of a sycamore stump,  though a favorite place for depositing the eggs is a little depression  under a small bush or overhanging rock on a steep hillside.    Renowned naturalists have long argued that the Vulture does not have  an extraordinary power of smell, but, according to Mr. Davie, an  excellent authority, it has been proven by the most satisfactory  experiments that the Turkey Buzzard does possess a keen sense of smell  by which it can distinguish the odor of flesh at a great distance.    The flight of the Turkey Vulture is truly beautiful, and no landscape  with its patches of green woods and grassy fields, is perfect without  its dignified figure high in the air, moving round in circles, steady,  graceful and easy, and apparently without effort. \"It sails,\" says  Dr. Brewer, \"with a steady, even motion, with wings just above the  horizontal position, with their tips slightly raised, rises from the  ground with a single bound, gives a few flaps of the wings, and then  proceeds with its peculiar soaring flight, rising very high in the  air.\"    The Vulture pictured in the accompanying plate was obtained between  the Brazos river and Matagorda bay. With it was found the Black  Vulture, both nesting upon the ground. As the nearest trees were  thirty or forty miles distant these Vultures were always found in this  situation. The birds selected an open spot beneath a heavy growth of  bushes, placing the eggs upon the bare ground. The old bird when  approached would not attempt to leave the nest, and in the case of the  young bird in the plate, the female to protect it from harm, promptly  disgorged the putrid contents of her stomach, which was so offensive  that the intruder had to close his nostrils with one hand while he  reached for the young bird with the other.    The Turkey Vulture is a very silent bird, only uttering a hiss of  defiance or warning to its neighbors when feeding, or a low gutteral  croak of alarm when flying low overhead.    The services of the Vultures as scavengers in removing offal render  them valuable, and almost a necessity in southern cities. If an animal  is killed and left exposed to view, the bird is sure to find out the  spot in a very short time, and to make its appearance as if called by  some magic spell from the empty air.        \"Never stoops the soaring Vulture      On his quarry in the desert,      On the sick or wounded bison,      But another Vulture, watching,      From his high aerial lookout,      Sees the downward plunge and follows;      And a third pursues the second,      Coming from the invisible ether,      First a speck, and then a Vulture,      Till the air is dark with pinions.\"          TO A WATER-FOWL.          Whither, 'midst falling dew        While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,      Far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue        Thy solitary way?        Vainly the fowler's eye        Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,      As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,        Thy figure floats along.        Seek'st thou the plashy brink        Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,      Or where the rocky billows rise and sink        On the chafed ocean side.        There is a Power whose care        Teaches thy way along that pathless coast--      The desert and illimitable air--        Lone wandering, but not lost.        All day thy wings have fanned,        At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere,      Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land        Though the dark night is near.        And soon that toil shall end;        Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and nest,      And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,        Soon o'er thy sheltered nest.        Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven        Hath swallowed up thy form; yet on my heart      Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given,        And shall not soon depart.        He who from zone to zone,        Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,      In the long way that I must tread alone,        Will lead my steps aright.                                   WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.           [Illustration: From col. F. M. Woodruff.                  GAMBEL'S PARTRIDGE.]    GAMBEL'S PARTRIDGE.      Gambel's Partridge, of which comparatively little is known, is a  characteristic game bird of Arizona and New Mexico, of rare beauty,  and with habits similar to others of the species of which there are  about two hundred. Mr. W. E. D. Scott found the species distributed  throughout the entire Catalina region in Arizona below an altitude of  5,000 feet. The bird is also known as the Arizona Quail.    The nest is made in a depression in the ground sometimes without any  lining. From eight to sixteen eggs are laid. They are most beautifully  marked on a creamy-white ground with scattered spots and blotches of  old gold, and sometimes light drab and chestnut red. In some specimens  the gold coloring is so pronounced that it strongly suggests to the  imagination that this quail feeds upon the grains of the precious  metal which characterizes its home, and that the pigment is imparted  to the eggs.    After the nesting season these birds commonly gather in \"coveys\" or  bevies, usually composed of the members of but one family. As a rule  they are terrestrial, but may take to trees when flushed. They are  game birds _par excellence_, and, says Chapman, trusting to the  concealment afforded by their dull colors, attempt to avoid detection  by hiding rather than by flying. The flight is rapid and accompanied  by a startling whirr, caused by the quick strokes of their small,  concave, stiff-feathered wings. They roost on the ground, tail to  tail, with heads pointing outward; \"a bunch of closely huddled  forms--a living bomb whose explosion is scarcely less startling than  that of dynamite manufacture.\"    The Partridge is on all hands admitted to be wholly harmless, and at  times beneficial to the agriculturist. It is an undoubted fact that it  thrives with the highest system of cultivation, and the lands that are  the most carefully tilled, and bear the greatest quantity of grain and  green crops, generally produce the greatest number of Partridges."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26672"],[0,"Bookbinding, and the Care of Books (#5)"],[1," books is one of the greatest troubles the bookbinder has to  face. The highly loaded and glazed surface of some of the heavy plate  papers easily flakes off, so that any guard pasted on these plates is  apt to come away, taking with it the surface of the paper. Moreover,  should the plates chance to be fingered or in any way soiled, nothing  can remove the marks; and should a corner get turned down, the paper  breaks and the corner will fall off. It is the opinion of experts that  this heavily loaded Art Paper will not last a reasonable time, and,  apart from other considerations, this should be ample reason for not  using it in books that are expected to have a permanent value.  Printers like this paper, because it enables them to obtain brilliant  impressions from blocks produced by cheap processes.    In \"cased\" books, sewn by machinery, the head and tail of the sheets  will often be found to be split up as far as the \"kettle\" stitches. If  such a book is to be expensively bound, it will require mending  throughout in these places, or the glue may soak into the torn ends,  and make the book open stiffly.    Some books are put together with staples of tinned iron wire, which  rapidly rust and disfigure the book by circular brown marks. Such  marks will usually have to be cut out and the places carefully mended.  This process is lengthy, and consequently so costly, that it is  generally cheaper, when possible, to obtain an unbound copy of the  book from the publishers, than to waste time repairing the damage done  by the cloth binder.    Generally speaking, the sections of a book cased in cloth by modern  methods are so injured as to make it unfit for more permanent binding  unless an unreasonable amount of time is spent on it. It is a great  pity that publishers do not, in the case of books expected to have a  permanent literary value, issue a certain number of copies printed on  good paper, and unbound, for the use of those who require permanent  bindings; and in such copies it would be a great help if sufficient  margin were left at the back of the plates for the binder to turn it  up to form a guard. If the plates were very numerous, guards made of  the substance of the plates themselves would make the book too thick;  but in the case of books with not more than a dozen plates, printed on  comparatively thin paper, it would be a great advantage.    Some books in which there are a large number of plates are cut into  single leaves, which are held together at the back by a coating of an  indiarubber solution. For a short time such a volume is pleasant  enough to handle, and opens freely, but before long the indiarubber  perishes, and the leaves and plates fall apart. When a book of this  kind comes to have a permanent binding, all the leaves and plates have  to be pared at the back and made up into sections with guards--a  troublesome and expensive business. The custom with binders is to  overcast the backs of the leaves in sections, and to sew through the  overcasting thread, but this, though an easy and quick process, makes  a hopelessly stiff back, and no book so treated can open freely.                                     REFOLDING        [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Dividers]    When the sheets of books that have to be rebound have been carelessly  folded, a certain amount of readjustment is often advisable,  especially in cases where the book has not been previously cut. The  title-page and the half-title, when found to be out of square, should  nearly always be put straight. The folding of the whole book may be  corrected by taking each pair of leaves and holding them up to the  light and adjusting the fold so that the print on one leaf comes  exactly over the print on the other, and creasing the fold to make  them stay in that position. With a pair of dividers (fig. 6) set to  the height of the shortest top margin, points the same distance above  the headline of the other leaves can be made. Then against a  carpenter's square, adjusted to the back of the fold, the head of one  pair of leaves at a time can be cut square (see fig. 7). If the book  has been previously cut this process is apt to throw the leaves so far  out of their original position as to make them unduly uneven.        [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    Accurate folding is impossible if the \"register\" of the printing is  bad, that is to say, if the print on the back of a leaf does not lie  exactly over that on the front.    Crooked plates should usually be made straight by judicious trimming  of the margins. It is better to leave a plate short at tail or  fore-edge than to leave it out of square.                                KNOCKING OUT JOINTS    The old \"joints\" must be knocked out of the sections of books that  have been previously backed. To do this, one or two sections at a time  are held firmly in the left hand, and well hammered on the  knocking-down iron fixed into the lying press. It is important that  the hammer face should fall exactly squarely upon the paper, or it may  cut pieces out. The knocking-down iron should be covered with a piece  of paper, and the hammer face must be perfectly clean, or the sheets  may be soiled.                                        CHAPTER III            Guarding--Throwing Out--Paring Paper--Soaking off India                Proofs--Mounting very Thin Paper--Splitting                    Paper--Inlaying--Flattening Vellum                                     GUARDING    Guards are slips of thin paper or linen used for strengthening the  fold of leaves that are damaged, or for attaching plates or single  leaves.    Guards should be of good thin paper. That known as Whatman's Banknote  paper answers very well. An easy way to cut guards is shown in fig.  8. Two or three pieces of paper of the height of the required guards  are folded and pinned to the board by the right-hand corners. A series  of points are marked at the head and tail with dividers set to the  width desired for the guards, and with a knife guided by a  straight-edge, cuts joining the points are made right through the  paper, but not extending quite to either end. On a transverse cut  being made near the bottom, the guards are left attached by one end  only (see fig. 9), and can be torn off as wanted. This method prevents  the paper from slipping while it is being cut.        [Illustration: FIG. 8.]        [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    A mount cutter's knife (fig. 10) will be found to be a convenient form  of knife to use for cutting guards.    In using the knife and straight-edge a good deal of pressure should be  put on the straight-edge, and comparatively little on the knife.        [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Mount Cutter's Knife]    To mend the torn back of a pair of leaves, a guard should be selected  a little longer than the height of the pages and well pasted with  white paste (see page 288). If the pair of leaves are not quite  separated, the pasted guard held by its extremities may be simply laid  along the weak place and rubbed down through blotting-paper. If the  leaves are quite apart, it is better to lay the pasted guard on a  piece of glass and put the edges of first one and then the other leaf  on to it and rub down.    On an outside pair of leaves the guard should be inside, so that the  glue may catch any ragged edges; while on the inside pair the guard  should be outside, or it will be found to be troublesome in sewing. In  handling the pasted guards care is needed not to stretch them, or they  may cause the sheet to crinkle as they dry.        [Illustration: FIG. 11.]    Plates must be guarded round the sections next them. When there are a  great many plates the back margin of each, to which a guard will be  attached, must be pared (see fig. 11, A), or the additional thickness  caused by the guards will make the back swell unduly. In guarding  plates a number can be pasted at once if they are laid one on another,  with about an eighth of an inch of the back of each exposed, the top  of the pile being protected by a folded piece of waste paper (see fig.  12). To paste, the brush is brought from the top to the bottom of the  pile only, and not the other way, or paste will get between the plates  and soil them. Guards should usually be attached to the backs of  plates, and should be wide enough to turn up round the adjoining  section, so that they may be sewn through. Should a plate come in the  middle of a section, the guard is best turned back and slightly pasted  to the inside of the sheet and then sewn through in the ordinary way.        [Illustration: FIG. 12.]    If plates are very thick, they must be hinged, as shown at fig. 11, B.  This is done by cutting a strip of about a quarter of an inch off the  back of the plate, and guarding with a wide guard of linen, leaving a  small space between the plate and the piece cut off to form a hinge.  It will save some swelling if the plate is pared and a piece of  thinner paper substituted for the piece cut off (see fig. 11, C). If  the plates are of cardboard, they should be guarded on both sides with  linen, and may even need a second joint.    A book that consists entirely of plates or single leaves must be made  up into sections with guards, and sewn as usual. In books in which  there are a great many plates, it is often found that two plates  either come together in the centre of a section, or come at opposite  sides of the same pair of leaves. Such plates should be guarded  together and treated as folded sheets (see fig. 13).        [Illustration: FIG. 13.]    In order to be sure that the pages of a book to be guarded throughout  will come in their proper order, it is well to make a plan of the  sections as follows, and to check each pair of leaves by it, as they  are guarded:--    Thus, if the book is to be made up into sections of eight leaves, the  pairs of leaves to be guarded together can be seen at once if the  number of the pages are written out--        1, 3, 5, 7,--9,"]]]
