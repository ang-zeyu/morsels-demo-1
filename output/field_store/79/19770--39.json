The child was clearly European by predominance  of race. They spent five hours of their precious time in  discussion. The officials wanted to oblige the Administrator, and  they had their way at last. But whether the child once admitted  will have much of a time, I am inclined to doubt, should she pass  into the Paradise of so select an academy. I heard an ominous  story of the Dutch minister last week, how he had threatened a  hiding to any child of his that spoke to this forlorn little  girl, who seems hard up for playmates. I heard yesterday that one  of my Church magnates had asked that the child should not come up  to play with his own. Yet the Fire of God has been preached, and  I am willing to allow that the thing may have wanted doing rather  badly in my amiable parish. Doesn't any real true Christian Peace  Doctrine mean spiritual fire and sword? Doesn't it mean burning  and fuel of fire as set against the confused noise and garments  rolled in blood of earthly campaigns? Doesn't any real true  Christian Imperialism mean the sword of the Spirit and the fire  of the Gospel against South African Racialism? Perfect love  casteth out fear, but what has Racialism to do with such a  perfect love as will banish the fear of God?    After all, can any reasonable and lively Christian Faith avail to  find any evangelically reasonable destination short of hell for  South African Racialists dying in their Racialism save such place  of purgation as my friend indicated? Yes, of course, God's  prerogative of mercy in Jesus is limitless, but are these  Racialists so merciful to little colored children that they  should obtain mercy without judgment from Jesus' judgment?    And if the purgative fire seem so inevitable, why not warn its  prospective fuel?    Granted the Love of Jesus (Who was certainly what South Africans  would call a Jew Boy, Who was possibly so dark that any dorp  school would have hummed over His admission, Who enrolled Himself  in that House of David one of Whose ancestresses was the Hamitic  Rahab apparently, Who took Ham's curse as well as Japheth's);  granted that that Love is the one and only supreme motive for  Christian Reform, yet for all that, facts are facts, and it may  be kind to tell people into what fires the fires of Racialism  threaten to merge their selves. On the whole, I am glad that our  lay reader preached on that bright morning that over-gloomed  sermon, preaching from my own soothing pulpit to my startled  congregation. They did not seem to know what to make of it. But  the preacher himself seemed quite unrepentant about it. He was  talking to me about it that morning when we drove home again, he  to his farm and I with him, to walk on to my mission. We  outspanned in a very green valley, I remember, and sat long over  roast monkey-nuts that his driver benignantly provided.    'The Lord put a word into my mouth,' my friend said quite firmly  and simply. 'Was there not the cause the cause of a child's  career? Didn't our Savior speak plainly as to the ugly analogy of  the man drowned like a dog with a stone round his neck in the  deep of the sea? Weren't His children in question when Jesus  spoke; wasn't there a Christian child in question when I  preached?'    I thought he made out something of a case for his position as a  preacher of fiery doom. We were sitting on a beautiful green  carpet. The Earth there had come through her bad time. Away  on the hillside a black forbidding patch testified to the  unpleasantness of the remedial stage. Away in the distance was a  beautiful tree-shaded granite hill with much show of brown  foliage and purplish underspaces. Just beside that hill the  flames came driving (through the old last year's feed, I  suppose). His eyes followed mine the way of the flames. 'Hurray!'  he said heartily. 'Now we shan't be so very long surely after  all. Don't you see the green grass on its way? It was a snug  corner, verily, for the old dry stuff. Look, how the flames leap  up in the thick of it! Not very juicy browse nor tasty feed, but  fine fuel for the fire; good for that, anyway. It was a snug  corner, but at last the time was ripe when the fire came driving  straight for it the fire with the wind behind. 'Which things are  a parable,' he said, his ugly sunburnt face twitching curiously,  his eyes quite handsome, nay, even splendid with honest scorn. He  was shaking his fist towards the prim little dorp that we had  left behind over the ridges. 'No doubt but ye are the people,' he  said, 'ye that have made the freedom of England and the franchise  of Jesus of no effect by your tradition your sacrosanct  tradition. What's the good of the frowsy old stuff? It must be  some good; what is it? It isn't very good pasture for sheep or  horses, not to speak of dairy cattle, but it's noble food for  fire, don't you think?    There it lies-up so snug and sheltered and screened the old dead  survival hidden in the prim little corrugated iron-roofed houses,  and the narrow gumtree avenues, and the whitewashed Dutch  tabernacle where they sing \"Safe in the Arms of Jesus\" (would you  believe it?) But the time will come, it mayn't come in my day or  in yours, but the time will come sure enough, when the Fire will  trek dead straight for this old dead-ripe stuff, the Fire with  the Wind behind. Then God have mercy on them whose work it was!  For their work shall be burnt, aren't we sure of that? But as to  they themselves being the sort to be saved so as by fire can we  be so very sanguine? Meanwhile. . . . . . .    The way he so humbly appealed to me for my opinion on that moot  point, did much to conciliate me. He had not carried me with him  all the while. He seemed to me a bit out of date, too like an  ante-Christian prophet. Yet how my heart went out to him as he  ended up so very abruptly with his 'meanwhile.' His voice broke  queerly, and his eyes shone. 'Meanwhile they may manage to give a  child or two a rough passage. They've got pluck enough for that,  the blighters, haven't they?' He turned away from me with a sort  of a sob. 'The time'll come sure enough, but it's their time now,  and they know it,' he said. 'God pity her!'        'LA BELLE DAME'        Inhabiting this country you inhabit the Middle Ages, you dwell in  the wild Marchlands without the pale of Christendom. Here a man  may take to the forest roads in the old spirit of errantry. How  darkly the shadow of witchcraft falls upon the path; we might be  in Lapland or Thessaly! What strange satyr voices the drums have  of nights! I suppose it is the reading about such things long ago  that gives me this sense of having been here before, of having  come back to this country!'    His eyes glistened as he sat over his wine, and smoked Transvaal  tobacco in a calabash pipe. He looked much more as he used to  look twenty years back, I thought. I had deemed him aged almost  out of recognition when first we sat down to dinner. He had come  up to Mashonaland with some learned association on a holiday  trip. His name was Gerald Browne; he had lectured on English  literature these many years in an ancient northern university.    With him came his wife, a very plain and quiet lady, and also an  undergraduate pupil named Drayton.    I was asked to meet them, and to stay in the same house with them  by a certain minor potentate of Rosebery, who had had rooms near  Browne's and mine in years gone by. It was Saturday night, and I  had just come in from the veld, while Browne's party had reached  Rosebery by the morning train. Dinner had gone rather quietly,  and our host had looked bored, I thought. Then, when the ladies  had left us, Browne had kindled up, and we all three had a  glorious hour, voicing the praises of Africa in a sort of  three-man descant or glee. Meanwhile the fourth man, Drayton, a  dark, plump and smiling youth, listened to us with a charming air  of respectful attention. Transvaal tobacco was good, and the talk  was good, though I say it who should not. Drayton's silence  was also good, a very complimentary silence with a distinct  character, as it seemed to me. On Sunday after lunch this youth  came for a walk with me, while the Brownes and our host reclined.    'Mr. Browne's got a sort of call to the Simple Life,' he suddenly  blurted out with a grin. 'It's even money on his selling up at  Oxford and coming out here for good. What's going to happen to  Mrs. Browne, I wonder?'    I laughed, as I thought he expected me to do.    'He seems rather smitten,' I admitted. 'He certainly raved a bit  last night; but, then, so many people do that when they first  come out.'    Drayton looked at me as if he might have said much more. But I  changed the subject; it never occurred to me then that it might  be a thrilling one. I went home later on and sat on the stoep and  talked to my host. Browne had very little to say. He went off for  a sunset walk, and never came to church at night. We sat up in  the moonlight waiting for him afterwards. He came in at last and  joined us on the stoep, but he was very silent. He would not have  any supper. He smoked away furiously till bed-time.    I arranged a riding trip for all three visitors next morning.  They were to off-saddle under some high kopjes about ten miles  from town; they were to have a picnic and an amazing view. I  could not go myself, as I had an appointment to keep. But I sent  two Mashona boys to be their retinue; one of them was Johannes,  my own right hand at home. I solemnly entrusted the strangers and  their steeds to his keeping.    When I came in about sunset that Monday evening they had not  returned. But before the daylight failed, three of them were back  Mrs. Browne, Drayton, and the under-boy. Where were Browne and  Johannes? Mrs. Browne seemed to be a little uneasy, but she  affected to make light of what had happened. She said that her  husband had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#5)"],[1,"from the  litigious humour of loving to wrangle about words or terms or notions  as empty; they had before his coming in, readily agreed promiscuously  to use when they pleased, Elements and Principles as terms equivalent:  and to understand both by the one and the other, those primitive and  simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into  which they are ultimately resolved. And upon the same account (he  added) we agreed to discourse of the opinions to be debated, as we  have found them maintained by the Generality of the assertors of the  four Elements of the one party, and of those that receive the three  Principles on the other, without tying our selves to enquire  scrupulously what notion either _Aristotle_ or _Paracelsus_, or this  or that Interpreter, or follower of either of those great persons,  framed of Elements or Principles; our design being to examine, not  what these or those writers thought or taught, but what we find to be  the obvious and most general opinion of those, who are willing to be  accounted Favourers of the Peripatetick or Chymical Doctrine,  concerning this subject.    I see not (saies _Eleutherius_) why you might not immediately begin to  argue, if you were but agreed which of your two friendly Adversaries  shall be first heard. And it being quickly resolv'd on that  _Themistius_ should first propose the Proofs for his Opinion, because  it was the antienter, and the more general, he made not the company  expect long before he thus addressed himself to _Eleutherius_, as to  the Person least interessed in the dispute.    If you have taken sufficient notice of the late Confession which was  made by _Carneades_, and which (though his Civility dressed it up in  complementall Expressions) was exacted of him by his Justice, I  suppose You will be easily made sensible, that I engage in this  Controversie with great and peculiar Disadvantages, besides those  which his Parts and my Personal Disabilities would bring to any other  cause to be maintained by me against him. For he justly apprehending  the force of truth, though speaking by no better a tongue then mine,  has made it the chief condition of our Duell, that I should lay aside  the best Weapons I have, and those I can best handle; Whereas if I  were allowed the freedom, in pleading for the four Elements, to employ  the Arguments suggested to me by Reason to demonstrate them, I should  almost as little doubt of making You a Proselyte to those unsever'd  Teachers, Truth and _Aristotle_, as I do of your Candour and your  Judgment. And I hope you will however consider, that that great  Favorite and Interpreter of Nature, _Aristotle_, who was (as his  _Organum_ witnesses) the greatest Master of Logick that ever liv'd,  disclaim'd the course taken by other petty Philosophers (Antient and  Modern) who not attending the Coherence and Consequences of their  Opinions, are more sollicitous to make each particular Opinion  plausible independently upon the the [Transcriber's Note: extra \"the\"  in original] rest, then to frame them all so, as not only to be  consistent together, but to support each other. For that great Man in  his vast and comprehensive Intellect, so fram'd each of his Notions,  that being curiously adapted into one Systeme, they need not each of  them any other defence then that which their mutuall Coherence gives  them: As 'tis in an Arch, where each single stone, which if sever'd  from the rest would be perhaps defenceless, is sufficiently secur'd by  the solidity and entireness of the whole Fabrick of which it is a  part. How justly this may be apply'd to the present case, I could  easily shew You, if I were permitted to declare to You, how harmonious  _Aristotles_ Doctrine of the Elements is with his other Principles of  Philosophy; and how rationally he has deduc'd their number from that  of the combinations of the four first Qualities from the kinds of  simple Motion belonging to simple bodies, and from I know not how many  other Principles and _Phaenomena_ of Nature, which so conspire with his  Doctrine of the Elements, that they mutually strengthen and support  each other. But since 'tis forbidden me to insist on Reflections of  this kind, I must proceed to tell You, that though the Assertors of  the four Elements value Reason so highly, and are furnish'd with  Arguments enough drawn from thence, to be satisfi'd that there must be  four Elements, though no Man had ever yet made any sensible tryal to  discover their Number, yet they are not destitute of Experience to  satisfie others that are wont to be more sway'd by their senses then  their Reason. And I shall proceed to consider the testimony of  Experience, when I shall have first advertis'd You, that if Men were  as perfectly rational as 'tis to be wish'd they were, this sensible  way of Probation would be as needless as 'tis wont to be imperfect.  For it is much more high and Philosophical to discover things _a  priore_, then _a posteriore_. And therefore the Peripateticks have not  been very sollicitous to gather Experiments to prove their Doctrines,  contenting themselves with a few only, to satisfie those that are not  capable of a Nobler Conviction. And indeed they employ Experiments  rather to illustrate then to demonstrate their Doctrines, as  Astronomers use Sphaeres of pastboard, to descend to the capacities of  such as must be taught by their senses, for want of being arriv'd to a  clear apprehension of purely Mathematical Notions and Truths. I speak  thus _Eleutherius_ (adds _Themistius_) only to do right to Reason, and  not out of Diffidence of the Experimental proof I am to alledge. For  though I shall name but one, yet it is such a one as will make all  other appear as needless as it self will be found Satisfactory. For if  You but consider a piece of green-Wood burning in a Chimney, You will  readily discern in the disbanded parts of it the four Elements, of  which we teach It and other mixt bodies to be compos'd. The fire  discovers it self in the flame by its own light; the smoke by  ascending to the top of the chimney, and there readily vanishing into  air, like a River losing it self in the Sea, sufficiently manifests to  what Element it belongs and gladly returnes. The water in its own form  boyling and hissing at the ends of the burning Wood betrayes it self  to more then one of our senses; and the ashes by their weight, their  firiness, and their dryness, put it past doubt that they belong to the  Element of Earth. If I spoke (continues _Themistius_) to less knowing  Persons, I would perhaps make some Excuse for building upon such an  obvious and easie _Analysis_, but 'twould be, I fear, injurious, not  to think such an Apology needless to You, who are too judicious either  to think it necessary that Experiments to prove obvious truths should  be farr fetch'd, or to wonder that among so many mixt Bodies that are  compounded of the four Elements, some of them should upon a slight  _Analysis_ manifestly exhibite the Ingredients they consist of.  Especially since it is very agreeable to the Goodness of Nature, to  disclose, even in some of the most obvious Experiments that Men make,  a Truth so important, and so requisite to be taken notice of by them.  Besides that our _Analysis_ by how much the more obvious we make it,  by so much the more suittable it will be to the Nature of that  Doctrine which 'tis alledged to prove, which being as clear and  intelligible to the Understanding as obvious to the sense, tis no  marvail the learned part of Mankind should so long and so generally  imbrace it. For this Doctrine is very different from the whimseys of  _Chymists_ and other Modern Innovators, of whose _Hypotheses_ we may  observe, as Naturalists do of less perfect Animals, that as they are  hastily form'd, so they are commonly short liv'd. For so these, as  they are often fram'd in one week, are perhaps thought fit to be  laughed at the next; and being built perchance but upon two or three  Experiments are destroyed by a third or fourth, whereas the doctrine  of the four Elements was fram'd by _Aristotle_ after he had leasurely  considered those Theories of former Philosophers, which are now with  great applause revived, as discovered by these latter ages; And had so  judiciously detected and supplyed the Errors and defects of former  _Hypotheses_ concerning the Elements, that his Doctrine of them has  been ever since deservedly embraced by the letter'd part of Mankind:  All the Philosophers that preceded him having in their several ages  contributed to the compleatness of this Doctrine, as those of  succeeding times have acquiesc'd in it. Nor has an _Hypothesis_ so  deliberately and maturely established been called in Question till in  the last Century _Paracelsus_ and some few other sooty Empiricks,  rather then (as they are fain to call themselves) Philosophers, having  their eyes darken'd, and their Brains troubl'd with the smoke of their  own Furnaces, began to rail at the Peripatetick Doctrine, which they  were too illiterate to understand, and to tell the credulous World,  that they could see but three Ingredients in mixt Bodies; which to  gain themselves the repute of Inventors, they endeavoured to disguise  by calling them, instead of Earth, and Fire, and Vapour, Salt,  Sulphur, and Mercury; to which they gave the canting title of  Hypostatical Principles: but when they came to describe them, they  shewed how little they understood what they meant by them, by  disagreeing as much from one another, as from the truth they agreed in  opposing: For they deliver their _Hypotheses_ as darkly as their  Processes; and 'tis almost as impossible for any sober Man to find  their meaning, as 'tis for them to find their Elixir. And indeed  nothing has spread their Philosophy, but their great Brags and  undertakings; notwithstanding all which, (sayes _Themistius_ smiling)  I scarce know any thing they have performed worth"]]]
