Here we actually see the tides performing a piece of definite  and very laborious work, to accomplish which by the more ordinary  agents would be a stupendous task.    In some places the tides are actually harnessed so as to accomplish  useful work. I have read that underneath old London Bridge there used  formerly to be great water-wheels, which were turned by the tide as it  rushed up the river, and turned again, though in the opposite way, by  the ebbing tide. These wheels were, I believe, employed to pump up  water, though it does not seem obvious for what purposes the water  would have been suitable. Indeed in the ebb and flow all round our  coasts there is a potential source of energy which has hitherto been  allowed to run to waste. The tide could be utilized in various ways.  Many of you will remember the floating mills on the Rhine. They are  vessels like paddle steamers anchored in the rapid current. The flow  of the river makes the paddles rotate, and thus the machinery in the  interior is worked. Such craft moored in a rapid tide-way could also  be made to convey the power of the tides into the mechanism of the  mill. Or there is still another method which has been employed, and  which will perhaps have a future before it in those approaching times  when the coal-cellars of England shall be exhausted. Imagine on the  sea-coast a large flat extent which is inundated twice every day by  the tide. Let us build a stout wall round this area, and provide it  with a sluice-gate. Open the gate as the tide rises, and the great  pond will be filled; then at the moment of high water close the  sluice, and the pond-full will be impounded. If at low tide the sluice  be opened the water will rush tumultuously out. Now suppose that a  water-wheel be provided, so that the rapid rush of water from the exit  shall fall upon its blades; then a source of power is obviously the  result.    At present, however, such a contrivance would naturally find no  advocates, for of course the commercial aspect of the question is that  which will decide whether the scheme is practicable and economical.  The issue indeed can be very simply stated. Suppose that a given  quantity of power be required--let us say that of one hundred horse.  Then we have to consider the conditions under which a contrivance of  the kind we have sketched shall yield a power of this amount. Sir  William Thomson, in a very interesting address to the British  Association at York in 1881, discussed this question, and I shall here  make use of the facts he brought forward on that occasion. He showed  that to obtain as much power as could be produced by a steam-engine  of one hundred horse power, a very large reservoir would be required.  It is doubtful indeed whether there would be many localities on the  earth which would be suitable for the purpose. Suppose, however, an  estuary could be found which had an area of forty acres; then if a  wall were thrown across the mouth so that the tide could be impounded,  the total amount of power that could be yielded by a water-wheel  worked by the incessant influx and efflux of the tide would be equal  to that yielded by the one hundred horse engine, running continuously  from one end of the year to the other.    There are many drawbacks to a tide-mill of this description. In the  first place, its situation would naturally be far removed from other  conveniences necessary for manufacturing purposes. Then too there is  the great irregularity in the way in which the power is rendered  available. At certain periods during the twenty-four hours the mill  would stop running, and the hours when this happened would be  constantly changing. The inconvenience from the manufacturer's point  of view of a deficiency of power during neap tides might not be  compensated by the fact that he had an excessive supply of power at  spring-tides. Before tide-mills could be suitable for manufacturing  purposes, some means must be found for storing away the energy when it  is redundant, and applying it when its presence is required. We should  want in fact for great sources of energy some contrivance which shall  fulfil the same purpose as the accumulators do in an electrical  installation.    Even then, however, the financial consideration remains, as to whether  the cost of building the dam and maintaining the tide-mill in good  order will not on the whole exceed the original price and the charges  for the maintenance of a hundred horse power steam-engine. There  cannot be a doubt that in this epoch of the earth's history, so long  as the price of coal is only a few shillings a ton, the tide-mill,  even though we seem to get its power without current expense, is  vastly more expensive than a steam-engine. Indeed, Sir William Thomson  remarks, that wherever a suitable tidal basin could be found, it would  be nearly as easy to reclaim the land altogether from the sea. And if  this were in any locality where manufactures were possible, the  commercial value of forty acres of reclaimed land would greatly exceed  all the expenses attending the steam-engine. But when the time comes,  as come it apparently will, that the price of coal shall have risen to  several pounds a ton, the economical aspect of steam as compared with  other prime movers will be greatly altered; it will then no doubt be  found advantageous to utilize great sources of energy, such as Niagara  and the tides, which it is now more prudent to let run to waste.    For my argument, however, it matters little that the tides are not  constrained to do much useful work. They are always doing work of some  kind, whether that be merely heating the particles of water by  friction, or vaguely transporting sand from one part of the ocean to  the other. Useful work or useless work are alike for the purpose of my  argument. We know that work can never be done unless by the  consumption or transformation of energy. For each unit of work that is  done--whether by any machine or contrivance, by the muscles of man or  any other animal, by the winds, the waves, or the tides, or in any  other way whatever--a certain equivalent quantity of energy must have  been expended. When, therefore, we see any work being performed, we  may always look for the source of energy to which the machine owes its  efficiency. In fact, it is the old story illustrated, that perpetual  motion is impossible. A mechanical device, however ingenious may be  the construction, or however accurate the workmanship, can never  possess what is called perpetual motion. It is needless to enter into  details of any proposed contrivance of wheels, of pumps, of pulleys;  it is sufficient to say that nothing in the shape of mechanism can  work without friction, that friction produces heat, that heat is a  form of energy, and that to replace the energy consumed in producing  the heat there must be some source from which the machine is  replenished if its motion is to be continued indefinitely.    Hence, as the tides may be regarded as a machine doing work, we have  to ascertain the origin of that energy which they are continually  expending. It is at this point that we first begin to feel the  difficulties inherent in the theory of tidal evolution. I do not mean  difficulties in the sense of doubts, for up to the present I have  mentioned no doubtful point. When I come to such I shall give due  warning. By difficulties I now mean points which it is not easy to  understand without a little dynamical theory; but we must face these  difficulties, and endeavour to elucidate them as well as we can.    Let us first see what the sources of energy can possibly be on which  the tides are permitted to draw. Our course is simplified by the fact  that the energy of which we have to speak is of a mechanical  description, that is to say, not involving heat or other more obscure  forms of energy. A simple type of energy is that possessed by a  clock-weight after the clock has been wound. A store of power is thus  laid up which is gradually doled out during the week in small  quantities, second by second, to sustain the motion of the pendulum.  The energy in this case is due to the fact that the weight is  attracted by the earth, and is yielded according as the weight sinks  downwards. In the separation between two mutually attracting bodies, a  store of energy is thus implied. What we learn from an ordinary clock  may be extended to the great bodies of the universe. The moon is a  gigantic globe separated from our earth by a distance of 240,000  miles. The attraction between these two bodies always tends to bring  them together. No doubt the moon is not falling towards the earth as  the descending clock-weight is doing. We may, in fact, consider the  moon, so far as our present object is concerned, to be revolving  almost in a circle, of which the earth is the centre. If the moon,  however, were to be stopped, it would at once commence to rush down  towards the earth, whither it would arrive with an awful crash in the  course of four or five days. It is fortunately true that the moon does  not behave thus; but it has the ability of doing so, and thus the mere  separation between the earth and the moon involves the existence of a  stupendous quantity of energy, capable under certain conditions of  undergoing transformation.    There is also another source of mechanical energy besides that we have  just referred to. A rapidly moving body possesses, in virtue of its  motion, a store of readily available energy, and it is easy to show  that energy of this type is capable of transformation into other  types.

He was refused admittance, but  he constantly passed an hour before it, and then returned. His fidelity at  length won over the porter, and he was one day allowed to enter. The dog  saw his master and clung to him. The gaoler with difficulty forced him  away. He came back the next morning, and every day; once each day he was  admitted. He licked the hand of his friend, looked him in the face, again  licked his hand, and went away of himself.    After the execution, at which the dog was present, he walked by the side  of the corpse to its burial-place, and after the ceremony laid himself  upon the grave. There he passed the first night, the next day, and the  second night. The neighbour in the meantime, unhappy at not seeing him,  goes in search of his friend, finds him by his master's grave, caresses  him, and makes him eat. An hour afterwards the dog escaped, and regained  his favourite place. Three months passed away, each morning of which he  came to seek his food, and then returned to the grave of his master; but  each day he was more sad, more meagre, more languishing. He was chained  up, but broke his fetters; escaped; returned to the grave, and never  quitted it more. It was in vain that they tried to bring him back. They  carried him food, but he ate no longer. For hours he was seen employing  his weakened limbs in digging up the earth that separated him from his  master. Passion gave him strength, and he gradually approached the body;  at last his faithful heart gave way, and he breathed out his last gasp, as  if he knew that he had found his master.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXII.    A Comedy of Quadrupeds.      In a play exhibited at Rome, in the reign of Tiberius, there were twelve  elephant performers, six males and six females, clothed in fancy costume.  After they had, at the command of their keeper, danced and performed a  thousand curious antics, a most sumptuous feast was served up for their  refreshment. The table was covered with all sorts of dainties, and golden  goblets filled with the most precious wines; and beds covered with purple  carpets were placed around for the animals to lie upon, after the manner  of the Romans when feasting. On these carpets the elephants laid  themselves down, and at a given signal they reached out their trunks to  the table, and fell to eating and drinking with as much propriety as if  they had been so many honest citizens.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXIII.    Cunning as a Fox.      An American gentleman was in pursuit of foxes, accompanied by two  bloodhounds; the dogs were soon in scent, and pursued a fox nearly two  hours, when suddenly they appeared at fault. The gentleman came up with  them near a large log lying upon the ground, and felt much surprised to  find them taking a circuit of a few rods without an object, every trace of  the game seeming to have been lost, while they kept still yelping. On  looking about him, he discovered sly Reynard stretched upon the log,  apparently lifeless. The master made several efforts to direct the  attention of his dogs towards the fox but failed; at length he approached  so near the artful object of his pursuit as to see him breathe. Even then  no alarm was exhibited; and the gentleman seizing a club, aimed a blow at  him, which Reynard evaded by a leap from his singular lurking-place,  having thus for a time effectually eluded his rapacious pursuers.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXIV.    More Faithful than Favoured.      A gentleman once possessed a mastiff which guarded the house and yard, but  had never met with the least particular attention from his master. One  night, as his master was retiring to his chamber, attended by his  _faithful_ valet, an Italian, the mastiff silently followed him upstairs,  which he had never been known to do before, and, to his master's  astonishment, presented himself in his bedroom. He was instantly turned  out; but the poor animal began scratching violently at the door, and  howling loudly for admission. The servant was sent to drive him away;  still he returned again, and was more importunate than before to be let  in. The gentleman, weary of opposition, bade the servant open the door,  that they might see what he wanted to do. This done, the dog deliberately  walked up, and crawling under the bed, laid himself down as if desirous to  take up his night's lodging there. To save farther trouble, the indulgence  was allowed. About midnight the chamber door opened, and a person was  heard stepping across the room. The gentleman started from his sleep; the  dog sprung from his covert, and seizing the unwelcome disturber, fixed him  to the spot! All was dark; and the gentleman rang his bell in great  trepidation, in order to procure a light. The person who was pinned to the  floor by the courageous mastiff roared for assistance. It was found to be  the valet, who little expected such a reception. He endeavoured to  apologise for his intrusion, and to make the reasons which induced him to  take this step appear plausible; but the importunity of the dog, the time,  the place, the manner of the valet, all raised suspicions in his master's  mind, and he determined to refer the investigation of the business to a  magistrate. The perfidious Italian at length confessed that it was his  intention to murder his master, and then rob the house. This diabolical  design was frustrated only by the instinctive attachment of the dog to his  master, which seemed to have been directed on this occasion by the  interference of Providence.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXV.    Elephant Rope Dancing.      The ease with which the elephant is taught to perform the most agile and  difficult feats, forms a remarkable contrast to its huge unwieldiness of  size. Aristotle tells us that in ancient times elephants were taught by  their keepers to throw stones at a mark, to cast up arms in the air, and  catch them again on their fall; and to dance not merely on the earth, but  on the rope. The first, according to Suetonius, who exhibited elephant  rope dancers, was Galba at Rome. The manner of teaching them to dance on  the ground was simple enough (by the association of music and a hot  floor); but we are not informed how they were taught to skip the rope, or  whether it was the tight or the slack rope, or how high the rope might be.  The silence of history on these points is fortunate for the figurantes of  the present day; since, but for this, their fame might have been utterly  eclipsed. Elephants may, in the days of old Rome, have been taught to  dance on the rope, but when was an elephant ever known to skip on a rope  over the heads of an audience, or to caper amidst a blaze of fire fifty  feet aloft in the air? What would Aristotle have thought of his dancing  elephants if he had seen some of the elephants who perform to-day?    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXVI.    A Providential Safe Conduct.      A traveller gives a singular anecdote of a lion, which he says was related  to him by very credible persons. About the year 1614 or 1615, two  Christian slaves at Morocco made their escape, travelling by night, and  hiding themselves in the tops of trees during the day, their Arab pursuers  frequently passing by them. One night, while pursuing their journey, they  were much astonished and alarmed to see a great lion close by them, who  walked when they walked, and stood still when they stood. Thinking this a  safe conduct sent to them by Providence, they took courage, and travelled  in the daytime in company with the lion. The horsemen who had been sent in  pursuit came up, and would have seized upon them, but the lion interposed,  and they were suffered to pass on. Every day these poor fugitives met with  some one or other of the human race who wanted to seize them, but the lion  was their protector until they reached the sea coast in safety, when he  left them.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXVII.    A Generous Revenge.      A young man, desirous of getting rid of his dog, took it along with him to  the river. He hired a boat, and rowing into the stream, threw the animal  in. The poor creature attempted to climb up the side of the boat, but his  master, whose intention was to drown him, constantly pushed him back with  the oar. In doing this, he fell himself into the water, and would  certainly have been drowned, had not the dog, as soon as he saw his master  struggling in the stream, suffered the boat to float away, and held him  above water till assistance arrived, and his life was saved.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXVIII.    Are Beasts mere Machines?      A gentleman one day talking with a friend maintained that beasts were mere  machines, and had no sort of reason to direct them; and that when they  cried or made a noise, it was only one of the wheels of the clock or  machine that made it. The friend, who was of a different opinion, replied,  \"I have now in my kitchen two turnspits, who take their turns regularly  every other day to get into the wheel; one of them, not liking his  employment, hid himself on the day that he should work, so that his  companion was forced to mount the wheel in his stead, but crying and  wagging his tail, he made a sign for those in attendance to follow him. He  immediately conducted them to a garret, where he dislodged the idle dog,  and killed him immediately.\"    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XXXIX.    Long Lost Found Again.      A female elephant belonging to a gentleman at Calcutta broke loose from  her keeper, and was lost in the woods. The excuses which the keeper made  were not admitted. It was supposed that he had sold the elephant; his wife  and family therefore were sold for slaves, and he was himself condemned to  work upon the roads.
