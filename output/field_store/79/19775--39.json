When       the two barons saw this troop of people, they descended from the       hillock, and, sticking spurs into their horses, made up to them. On       their arrival, they asked what was the matter. They were answered,       that it was the King of France, who had been made prisoner, and       that upward of ten knights and squires challenged him at the same       time, as belonging to each of them. The two barons then pushed       through the crowd by main force, and ordered all to draw aside.       They commanded, in the name of the prince, and under pain of       instant death, that every one should keep his distance, and not       approach unless ordered or desired so to do. They all retreated       behind the king; and the two barons, dismounting, advanced to the       king with profound reverences, and conducted him in a peaceable       manner to the Prince of Wales.    We continue our citation from Froissart with the brief chapter in which  the admiring chronicler tells the gallant story of the Black Prince's  behavior as host toward his royal captive, King John of France (it was  the evening after the battle):--         When evening was come, the Prince of Wales gave a supper in his       pavilion to the King of France, and to the greater part of the       princes and barons who were prisoners. The prince seated the King       of France, and his son the Lord Philip, at an elevated and       well-covered table: with them were Sir James de Bourbon, the Lord       John d'Artois, the earls of Tancarville, of Estampes, of Dammartin,       of Graville, and the Lord of Partenay. The other knights and       squires were placed at different tables. The prince himself served       the king's table, as well as the others, with every mark of       humility, and would not sit down at it, in spite of all his       entreaties for him so to do, saying that \"he was not worthy of such       an honor, nor did it appertain to him to seat himself at the table       of so great a king, or of so valiant a man as he had shown himself       by his actions that day.\" He added, also, with a noble air, \"Dear       sir, do not make a poor meal, because the Almighty God has not       gratified your wishes in the event of this day; for be assured that       my lord and father will show you every honor and friendship in his       power, and will arrange your ransom so reasonably, that you will       henceforward always remain friends. In my opinion, you have cause       to be glad that the success of this battle did not turn out as you       desired; for you have this day acquired such high renown for       prowess, that you have surpassed all the best knights on your side.       I do not, dear sir, say this to flatter you; for all those of our       side who have seen and observed the actions of each party, have       unanimously allowed this to be your due, and decree you the prize       and garland for it.\" At the end of this speech, there were murmurs       of praise heard from every one; and the French said the prince had       spoken nobly and truly, and that he would be one of the most       gallant princes in Christendom if God should grant him life to       pursue his career of glory.    A splendid and a gracious figure the Black Prince makes in the pages of  Froissart. It was great good fortune for the posthumous fame of  chivalry, that the institution should have come by an artist so gifted  and so loyal as this Frenchman, to deliver its features in portrait to  after-times, before the living original vanished forever from the view  of history. How much the fiction of Sir Walter Scott owes to Froissart,  and to Philip de Comines after Froissart, those only can understand who  have read both the old chronicles and the modern romances.    It was one of the congenial labors of Sidney Lanier--pure flame of  genius that late burned itself out so swiftly among us!--to edit a  reduction or abridgment of Froissart's Chronicles dedicated especially  to the use of the young. \"The Boy's Froissart,\" he called it. This book  is enriched with a wise and genial appreciation of Froissart's quality  by his American editor.    Whoever reads Froissart needs to remember that the old chronicler is too  much enamoured of chivalry, and is too easily dazzled by splendor of  rank, to be a rigidly just censor of faults committed by knights and  nobles and kings. Froissart, in truth, seems to have been nearly  destitute of the sentiment of humanity. War to him was chiefly a game  and a spectacle.    Our presentation of Froissart must close with a single passage  additional, a picturesque one, in which the chronicler describes the  style of living witnessed by him at the court--we may not unfitly so  apply a royal word--of the Count de Foix. The reader must understand,  while he reads what we here show, that Froissart himself, in close  connection, relates at full, in the language of an informant of his, how  this magnificent Count de Foix had previously killed, with a knife at  his throat, his own and his only son. \"I was truly sorry,\" so, at the  conclusion of the story, Froissart, with characteristic direction of his  sympathy, says, \"for the count his father, whom I found a magnificent,  generous, and courteous lord, and also for the country that was  discontented for want of an heir.\" Here is the promised passage; it  occurs in the ninth chapter of the third volume:--         Count Gaston Phoebus de Foix, of whom I am now speaking, was at       that time fifty-nine years old; and I must say, that although I       have seen very many knights, kings, princes, and others, I have       never seen any so handsome, either in the form of his limbs and       shape, or in countenance, which was fair and ruddy, with gray and       amorous eyes, that gave delight whenever he chose to express       affection. He was so perfectly formed, one could not praise him too       much. He loved earnestly the things he ought to love, and hated       those which it was becoming him so to hate. He was a prudent       knight, full of enterprise and wisdom. He had never any men of       abandoned character with him, reigned prudently, and was constant       in his devotions. There were regular nocturnals from the Psalter,       prayers from the rituals to the Virgin, to the Holy Ghost, and       from the burial service. He had every day distributed as alms, at       his gate, five florins in small coin, to all comers. He was liberal       and courteous in his gifts, and well knew how to take when it was       proper, and to give back where he had confidence. He mightily loved       dogs above all other animals, and during the summer and winter       amused himself much with hunting....         When he quitted his chamber at midnight for supper, twelve servants       bore each a lighted torch before him, which were placed near his       table, and gave a brilliant light to the apartment. The hall was       full of knights and squires, and there were plenty of tables laid       out for any person who chose to sup. No one spoke to him at his       table, unless he first began a conversation. He commonly ate       heartily of poultry, but only the wings and thighs; for in the       daytime, he neither ate nor drank much. He had great pleasure in       hearing minstrels; as he himself was a proficient in the science,       and made his secretaries sing songs, ballads, and roundelays. He       remained at table about two hours, and was pleased when fanciful       dishes were served up to him, which having seen, he immediately       sent them to the tables of his knights and squires.         In short, every thing considered, though I had before been in       several courts of kings, dukes, princes, counts, and noble ladies,       I was never at one that pleased me more, nor was I ever more       delighted with feats of arms, than at this of the Count de Foix.       There were knights and squires to be seen in every chamber, hall,       and court, going backwards and forwards, and conversing on arms and       amours. Every thing honorable was there to be found. All       intelligence from distant countries was there to be learnt, for the       gallantry of the count had brought visitors from all parts of the       world. It was there I was informed of the greater part of those       events which had happened in Spain, Portugal, Arragon, Navarre,       England, Scotland, and on the borders of Languedoc; for I saw,       during my residence, knights and squires arrive from every nation.       I therefore made inquiries from them, or from the count himself,       who cheerfully conversed with me.    The foregoing is one of the most celebrated passages of description in  Froissart. At the same time that it discloses the form and spirit of  those vanished days, which will never come again to the world, it  discloses likewise the character of the man, who must indeed have loved  it all well, to have been able so well to describe it.    We take now a somewhat long forward step, in going, as we do, at once  from Froissart to Rabelais. Comines, lying between, we must reluctantly  pass, with thus barely mentioning his name.

We,  too, learned how to value fresh water, and I would not have filled up my  cask with wine instead of it, had I been offered the finest in the  world.  We were especially favoured with fine weather and a fair wind,  and we made good use of our time, for every one on board was as busy as  a bee from morning till night.  We had prayers regularly morning and  evening out of the Prayer-book, and on a Sunday I read out of Galpin's  sermons, and that the lessons it taught might not be forgotten I used to  talk about them every day for the week which the Sunday began, and asked  the young people questions about it.  Then I set them their lessons, and  Mary or Peter heard them, and they got on famously.  They gave their  mind to the work, do you see, and did it well.        CHAPTER FOUR.    THE RESCUED STRANGER.    We made the Desertas off Rio without having had one day on which my wife  and the children couldn't be on deck with comfort.  They were tried  somewhat by the heat, for it was hot in our little cabin with the sun  striking down on the deck all day, but they didn't mind that much.  I  was most anxious about the sheep.  I had made up my mind that we were to  do great things with them, and I dreaded any of them dying.  We used to  have them up on deck every day to walk about, two at a time, and they  all became as tame as lambs; indeed, they lived like aldermen, and grew  as sleek and fat, for we kept them well washed and clean, for I couldn't  help thinking that would be conducive to their health.    It was necessary to go into Rio, but I was sorry to have to do it on one  account.  It is so beautiful a place that I thought my wife and daughter  might think meanly of our future home after it.  It is a beautiful  country, with its magnificent harbour, and surrounding hills, and  tropical trees and villas, and the city looks very fine till you get  into it.  I hoped not to be detained there more than three days, so as  soon as Peter had returned from the shore where he went to order our  provisions, and to learn where we could get the best water, I took my  wife and Mary and the rest of the children there, that they might see  what a foreign city is like.    Scarcely had we set foot on shore than we saw collected on the quay  nearly two hundred black people all huddled together, men and women,  young girls and boys, and little children, with hardly a rag to cover  them, looking wretched and startled and wild, very little like human  beings.  Mary drew closer to me.    \"Oh, father, what are they?\" she asked.    \"Those are negroes just landed from a slave ship,\" said I, for in those  days the Brazilians had no law against slaving.  \"They are on their way  to a shed, to be washed, fed, and dressed a little may be, and then sent  up to the slave market, where they will be sold one by one, or a lot  together, just as buyers may require, as a farmer sells his sheep and  cattle to a butcher or a grazier, to kill or fatten.\"    \"And those poor people have souls just as we have,\" exclaimed Mary.  \"How dreadful!\"    As we walked on we passed numbers of negroes grunting under heavy loads,  some working for their owners, others let out to hire like beasts of  burden, but none labouring for themselves.  A little further on we  passed a shrine, a little house open in front, with a figure in it, and  ornamented with flowers, and candles burning; and some people, women and  old men, were kneeling down before it, and muttering words as quickly as  their lips could move, and counting on necklaces with small and large  beads, and a cross at the end; and suddenly, as soon as they had done,  it seemed, up they jumped, and walked on, and other people passing just  made a bow and the sign of the cross, and hurried away.    \"Is that an idol, father?\" asked Mary; \"I didn't know these people were  heathen.\"    I thereon told her that the figure was that of a saint, and that the  people in their ignorance had got to worship the figure instead of  saying prayers to the saint, though even that to our notion was very  bad, as Christ had taught us to pray to God only.  I saw that my dear  wife, and Mary and Susan, were greatly shocked at this, but they were to  see something worse, for before long we espied a great crowd moving  towards us, and we got up into a porch to avoid them.  Presently there  came by first some men holding up a rich silken canopy, under which  walked a priest in magnificent robes all gold and silver, and he had  something in his hand; and as soon as the people saw him, whites and  blacks alike fell down on their knees and worshipped him, or rather, as  we were afterwards told, what he carried in his hands, which was the  host.  This is a wafer and some wine, which the people believe is turned  into the real body and blood of Christ.  After him came a number of  people with masks on their faces, and large cloaks on, so that they  could not be known, bearing on their shoulders a huge figure of the  Virgin Mary, and the infant Jesus in her arms.  She was dressed in robes  of silk with a crown of gold on her head, and numberless jewels  glittering on her shoulders.  Many other figures followed--one of Christ  bearing the cross, and of various saints; and there were little boys  looking like girls dressed up in pink and blue silk, and gold and silver  dresses all stuck out with glittering wings; and there were big boys or  priests in red and white gowns swinging censers, and others ringing  bells and chanting; and lastly there came regiments of soldiers with  bands playing before them, and the procession went on through a number  of streets, and at last into a church, when the soldiers marched away in  different directions.  We were told that it was a religious procession,  though we could not understand how it was to advance the cause of  religion; indeed, we were particularly struck by the indifference with  which all the people looked on, and those especially who walked in the  procession.  The men in black masks and hoods who carried the figures  were, we were told, doing penance for their sins, and that they believed  that they were thus washing away all the sins they had committed for the  year past; they, poor people, were not told by their priests that the  blood of Christ can alone cleanse men from sin.  We saw many other  things, some of which we admired, for the city has some fine squares,  and open places, and broad streets, and handsome buildings.  I need not  have been afraid of my wife wishing to remain in the country, for she  was in a hurry to get on board again, and declared that no money would  tempt her to live among people who held their fellow-creatures in  slavery, and practised such wicked mummeries and idolatries.    \"No,\" she exclaimed, \"let me live where I can have a parish church, in  which all pray and sing praises to God together in our own language, and  hear a simple sermon which we can understand, reminding us of our  duties, and admonishing us of our faults.  That's what I call public  worship.\"    \"And that's what I hope we shall get, dear wife, in time, out where we  are going, but I doubt whether we have much chance of it yet,\" said I;  for I knew that people when they get away from England are too apt to  grow careless about their church, and their religion also.    We quickly got on board our water, and fuel, and fresh provisions, and  some green stuff, and hay for the sheep, and corn for the fowls.  The  two boys went on shore with their brothers and brought off a bowl of  gold and silver fish, as they said, to make amends for the lark and one  of the robins which had died.  Once more the little _May Flower_ was  ploughing the ocean with her head to the east.  People at Rio were very  much astonished when they heard of the long voyage we were making.    \"I would rather be in that little craft with a clear conscience, than in  many a ship ten times her size which I have met at sea,\" I answered, and  it was proved that I was right.    As we were losing sight of the coast of South America, my wife, looking  back at it again, expressed her thankfulness that we were not compelled  to live among its inhabitants.    \"But,\" said I, \"it's a beautiful place, Martha.  So is this world a very  beautiful world, but it's man that mars it.  If man were free from sin,  it would be next to heaven itself.\"    For ten days or more we had a beautiful run to the eastward.  I never  saw the little craft go along so fast; it was difficult to believe that,  with the smooth sea we now had, we were out in mid-ocean, hundreds of  miles from any land.    We were in the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, and expected to make  the land in a few days, when the weather gave signs of changing.  We had  hitherto been greatly favoured, and I had, with the rest, begun to  believe that we should escape bad weather altogether.  The sea got up,  and the wind went on increasing, but we got the schooner under snug  canvas in good time.  As we were undermanned, it was necessary to be  very careful in that respect.  I told my wife and children that they  must look out for a regular gale, such as they had not been accustomed  to, and make everything fast in the cabins.  We got the sheep slung, so  as to prevent them being knocked over, and then at last battened down  the hatches, intending to heave the vessel to, should the gale not  abate.    I had been well accustomed to face bad weather in the Channel in my  little vessel, and so had my boys; and I knew well what she would do;  but when they saw the heavy seas now rolling up towards us, their young  cheeks turned pale with alarm.  It certainly did look as if one of those  heavy, moving, dark green, watery hills rising up on every side, with  the spoon-drift flying from their summits, must ere long engulf us; but  the tight little craft, buoyant as a cork, with her stout masts and  strong new canvas, every rope well served, and not a"]]]
