[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22784"],[0,"On Laboratory Arts (#5)"],[1,"since then I  have seen it used by an exceedingly clever \"trick\" glass-worker at a  show.  After trying both this arrangement and the \"brush flame\"  recommended by Mr. Shenstone, I consider the former the more  convenient;  however, I daresay that either can be made to work in  competent hands, but I shall here describe only my own choice.  [Footnote: A brush flame is one which issues from the blow-pipe nozzle  shaped like a brush, i.e.  it expands on leaving the jet.  It is  produced by using a cylindrical air jet or a conical jet with a large  aperture, say one-eighth of an inch.  See Fig.  25.]    As will be seen, the blow-pipe really consists of four simple brass  tube blow-pipes about three-eighths of an inch internal diameter and 3  inches long, each with its gas and air tap and appropriate nozzle.  Each blowpipe can turn about its support (the gas-entry pipe) to some  extent, and this possibility of adjustment is of importance, The air  jets are merely bits of very even three-sixteenths inch glass tubing,  drawn down to conical points, the jets themselves being about 0.035  inch diameter.    Fig.  5.    The flames produced are the long narrow blow-pipe flames used in  blow-pipe analysis, and arranged so as to consist mostly of oxidising  flame.  The air-supply does not require to be large, nor the pressure  high--5 to 10 inches of water will do--but it must be very regular.  The \"trick\" glass-blower I referred to employed a foot bellows in  connection with a small weighted gasometer, the Westinghouse Company  used their ordinary air-blast, and I have generally used a large  gas-holder with which I am provided, which is supplied by a Roots  blower worked by an engine.    I have also used a \"velocity pump\" blower, which may be purchased  amongst others from Gerhardt of Bonn.  The arrangement acts both as a  sucking and blowing apparatus, and is furnished with two manometers  and proper taps, etc.  As I have reason to know that arrangements of  this kind work very ill unless really well made, I venture to add that  the Gerhardt arrangement to which I refer is No.  239 in his  catalogue, and costs about three pounds.  It hardly gives enough air,  however, to work four blow-pipes, and the blast requires to be  steadied by passing the air through a vessel covered with a rubber  sheet.    In default of any of these means being available, one of Fletcher's  foot-blowers may be employed, but it must be worked very regularly.  A  table mounted with one blow-pipe made on this plan, and worked by a  double-acting bellows, is recommended for students' use.  For working  flint glass, the air jet may be one-eighth of an inch in diameter and  the pressure higher--this will give a brush flame.  See Fig.  25.    It will be seen, on looking at the sketch of the blowpipe system, that  the pair of blow-pipes farther from the observer can be caused to  approach or recede at will by means of a handle working a block on a  slide.  It often happens that after using all four blow-pipes at once  it is necessary to have recourse to one blow-pipe only, and to do this  conveniently and quickly is rather an object.  Now, in my arrangement  I have to turn off both the gas and air from the farther system, and  then put in a bit of asbestos board to prevent the nozzles being  damaged by the flame or flames kept alight.  As I said before, when  some experience is gained, glassblowing, becomes a very simple art,  and work can be done under circumstances so disadvantageous that they  would entirely frustrate the efforts of a beginner.  This is not any  excuse, however, for recommending inferior arrangements.    Consequently, I say that the pipes leading in gas and air should be  all branches of one gas and one air pipe, in so far as the two remote  and one proximate blow-pipe are concerned, and these pipes should come  up to the table to the right hand of the operator, and should have  main taps at that point, each with a handle at least 2 inches long.  By this arrangement the operator can instantly turn down all the  blow-pipes but one, while, if the inverse operation is required, all  the three pipes can be started at once.  [Footnote: I find, since  writing the above, that I have been anticipated in this recommendation  by Mr. G.  S.  Ram, The Incandescent Lamp and its Manufacture, p.  114.]    The separate air and gas taps must be left for permanent regulation,  and must not be used to turn the supply on or cut it off.  In some  respects this blow-pipe will be found more easy to manage than an  oxygas blow-pipe, for the glass is not so readily brought to the very  fluid state, and this will often enable a beginner who proceeds  cautiously to do more than he could with the more powerful instrument.    Though I have mentioned glass nozzles for the air supply, there is no  difficulty in making nozzles of brass.  For this purpose let the end  of a brass tube of about one-eighth of an inch diameter be closed by a  bit of brass wire previously turned to a section as shown (Fig.  6),  and then bored by a drill of the required diameter, say -.035 inch.  It  is most convenient to use too small a drill, and to gradually open the  hole by means of that beautiful tool, the watchmaker's \"broach.\"  The  edges of the jet should be freed from burr by means of a watchmaker's  chamfering tool (see Saunier's Watchmaker's Hand-book, Tripplin,  1882, p.  232, Sec. 342), or by the alternate use of a slip of Kansas  stone and the broach.    Fig.  6.    The construction of this blow-pipe is so simple, that in case any one  wishes to use a brush flame, he can easily produce one simply by  changing his air jets to bits of the same size (say one-eighth to  one-sixteenth of an inch) tubing, cut off clean.  To insure success,  the ends of the tubes must be absolutely plane and regular; the  slightest inequality makes all the difference in the action of the  instrument.  If a jet is found to be defective, cut it down a little  and try again; a clean-cut end is better than one which has been  ground flat on a stone.  The end of a tube may, however, be turned in  a manner hereafter to be described so as to make an efficient jet.  Several trials by cutting will probably have to be made before success  is attained.  For this kind of jet the air-pressure must be greatly  increased, and a large Fletcher's foot-blower or, better still, a  small double-action bellows worked with vigour will be found very  suitable.  A fitting for this auxiliary blow-pipe is shown in Fig.  5  at B.    Professor Roentgen's discovery has recently made it necessary to give  more particular attention to the working of soft soda glass, and I  have been obliged to supplement the arrangements described by a table  especially intended for work with glass of this character.  The  arrangement has proved so convenient for general work that I give the  following particulars.  The table measures 5 feet long, 2 feet 11  inches wide, and is 2 feet 9 inches high.    Fig.  7.    It is provided with a single gas socket, into which either a large or  small gas tube may be screwed.  The larger tube is 5.5 inches long and  0.75 of an inch in diameter.  The smaller tube is the same length, and  half an inch in diameter.  The axis of the larger tube is 3.5 inches  above the table at the point of support, and is inclined to the  horizontal at an angle of 12 deg..  The axis of the smaller tube is 2.5  inches above the surface of the table, and is inclined to the  horizontal at the same angle as the larger one.    The air jets are simply pieces of glass tube held in position by  corks.  The gas supply is regulated by a well-bored tap.  The air  supply is regulated by treading the bellows--no tap is requisite.  The bellows employed are ordinary smiths' bellows, measuring 22 inches  long by 13 inches wide in the widest part.  They are weighted by lead  weights, weighing 26 lbs.  The treadle is connected to the bellows by  a small steel chain, for the length requires to be invariable.  As the  treadle only acts in forcing air from the lower into the upper chamber  of the bellows, a weight of 13 lbs.  is hung on to the lower cover, so  as to open the bellows automatically.    The air jets which have hitherto been found convenient are:  for the small gas tube    (1) a tube 0.12 inch diameter drawn down to a jet of 0.032 inch  diameter for small work;    (2) plain tubes not drawn down of 0.14 inch, 0.127 inch, and -0.245  inch diameter, and for the large gas tube, plain tubes up to 0.3 inch  in diameter.    The table is placed in such a position that the operator sits with his  back to a window and has the black calico screen in front of him and  to his right.  The object of the screen is to protect the workman  against draughts.  The table is purposely left unscreened to the left  of the workman, so that long tubes may be treated.    Sec. 17.  Other appliances which will be required for glass-blowing are  of the simplest character.    (1) Small corks for closing the ends of tubes.    (2) Soft wax--a mixture of bees' wax and resin softened by linseed  oil to the proper consistency, easily found by trial, also used for  temporarily closing tubes.    (3) A bottle of vaseline for lubricating.    (4) An old biscuit tin filled with asbestos in shreds, and an asbestos  towel or cloth for annealing glass after removal from the flame.  As  asbestos absorbs moisture, which would defeat its use as an annealing  material, it must be dried if necessary.    (5) A Glass-Cutter's Knife. This is best made out of a fine  three-cornered file, with the file teeth almost ground out, but not  quite;  it should be about 2 inches long.  After the surface has been  ground several times, it may be necessary to reharden the steel.  This  is best done by heating to a full red and quenching in mercury.  The  grindstone employed for sharpening the knife should be \"quick,\" so as  to leave a rough edge.
