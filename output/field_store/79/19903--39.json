[Music]    There can be no Glad-man compar'd to the Mad-man,  His Mind is still void of Care;  His Fits and his Fancies, are above all Mischances,    And Mirth is his ordinary Fare.      _Then be thou Mad, Mad, Mad let's be,_      _Nor shall the foul Fiend be Madder than we._    The Wise and the Witty, in Court and in City,    Are subject to sorrow and Pain;  While he that is Mad, knows not why to be Sad,    Nor has any cause to complain:      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    We laugh at you Wise Men, that thus do despise Men,    Whose Senses you think to Decline;  Mark well and you'll see, what you count but Frenzy,    Is indeed but Raptures Divine.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    Let the Grave and the Wise, pluck out their Eyes,    To set forth a Book worth a Groat;  We Mad-men are quicker, grow Learn'd with good Liquor,    And Chirp a Merry note.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    Hast thou lost thy Estate Man, why, care not for that Man,    What Wealth may'st not fancy thy own;  More than Queen _Dido_, or her Ass-Ear'd _Midas_,    That great Philosopher's stone.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    _Pompey_ was a Mad-man, and so long a Glad-man;    But at length he was forc'd to flee;  For _Caesar_ from _Gallia_ beat him in _Pharsalia_,    'Cause a madder Fellow then he.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    'Twas this Extasie brave, that the great Courage gave,    If your Eyes were but ope'd and would see;  To great _Alexander_, that mighty Commander,    As Mad a Fellow as could be.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    Then around goes a Health to the Lady o'th' House,    If any Man here does forsake it;  For a Fool let him go, we know better Manners,    And so we mean to take it.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    There's no Night Mirth's going, nor any Lad wooing,    But Mad-men are privy unto it;  For the Stars so peep, into every such thing,    And wink upon us as you do it.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    When the Frost, Ice and Snow, do benumb things below,    We Chirp as merry as Larks;  Our Sack and our Madness, consumes cold and sadness,    And we are the Jovial Sparks.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    Has thy Mistress frown'd on thee, or thy Rival out-gone thee?    Let Sober and Wise Fellows pine;  Whilst bright _Miralind_ and goodly _Dulcind_,    And the rest of the Fairies are thine.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.    A Mad-man needs baulk no manner of talk,    His Tongues never guilty with Treason;  But a Wise Knave would suffer, if the same he should utter,    For a wise Man's Guilt is his Reason.      _Then be thou Mad_, &c.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    A Shepherd kept Sheep on a Hill so high, _fa, la, la_, &c.  And there came a pretty Maid passing by, _fa, la_, &c.  Shepherd, quoth she, dost thou want e'er a Wife,  No by my troth I'm not weary of my Life, _fa, la, la_, &c.    Shepherd for thee I care not a Fly, _fa, la, la_,  For thou'st not the Face with a fair Maid to lie, _fa, la_,  How now my Damsel, say'st thou me so,  Thou shalt tast of my bottle before thou dost go, _fa, la_.    Then he took her and laid her upon the Ground, _fa, la_,  And made her believe that the World went round, _fa, la_,  Look yonder my Shepherd, look yonder I spy,  There are fine pretty Babies that dance in the Sky, _fa, la_.    And now they are vanisht, and now they appear, _fa, la_,  Sure they will tell Stories of what we do here, _fa, la, la_,  Lie still my dear _Chloris_, enjoy thy Conceit,  For the Babes are too young and too little to prate, _fa, la, la_.    See how the Heavens fly swifter than Day, _fa, la, la_,  Rise quickly, or they will all run away, _fa, la, la_,  Rise quickly my Shepherd, quickly I tell ye,  For the Sun, Moon and Stars are got all in my Belly, _fa, la_.    O dear, where am I? pray shew me the way, _fa, la, la_,  Unto my Father's House hard by, _fa, la, la_,  If he chance to Chide me for staying so long,  I'll tell him the fumes of your Bottle were strong, _fa, la, la_.    And now thou hast brought my Body to shame, _fa, la_,  I prithee now tell me what is thy Name, _fa, la, la_,  Why _Robin_ in the Rushes my Name is, quoth he,  But I think I told her quite contrary, _fa, la, la_.    Then for _Robin_ in the Rushes, she did enquire, _fa, la, la_,  But he hung down his Head, and he would not come nigh her, _fa, la, la_,  He wink'd with one Eye, as if he had been Blind,  And he drew one Leg after a great way behind, _fa, la, la_.          _A_ SONG.      [Music]    As I was a walking under a Grove,    Within my self, as I suppos'd;  My Mind did oftentimes remove,    And by no means could be disclosed:  At length by chance a Friend I met,    Which caused me long time to tarry;  And thus of me she did intreat,    To tell her when I meant to Marry.    Sweet-heart, quoth I, if you would know,    Then hear the Words, and I'll reveal it;  Since in your Mind you bear it so,    And in your Heart you will conceal it:  She promis'd me she'd make no Words,    But of such things she would be wary;  And thus in brief I did begin,    To tell her when I meant to Marry.    When _Shrove-tide_ falls in _Easter_ week,    And _Christmas_ in the midst of _July_;  When Lawyers for no Fees will Plead,    And Taylors they prove Just and Truly:  When all Deceits are quite put down,    And Truth by all Men is preferred;  And _Indigo_ dies Red and Brown,    O then my Love and I'll be Married.    When Men and Beasts in the Ocean flow,    And Fishes in green Fields are feeding;  When Muscle-shells in the Streets grow,    And Swans upon dry Rocks be breeding:  When Cockle-shells are Diamond Rings,    And Glass to Pearl may be compared;  Gold is made of a Grey-goose Wings,    Oh then my Love and I'll be Married.    When hostesses do reckon true,    And _Dutchmen_ leave off drinking Brandy;  When Cats do bark, and Dogs do Mew,    And Brimstone is took for Sugar-candy:  Or when that _Whitsontide_ do fall,    Within the Month of _January_;  And a Cobler works without an Awl,    O then my, _&c._    When Women know not how to Scold,  And Maids on Sweet-hearts ne'er are thinking;  When Men in the Fire complain of Cold,    And Ships on _Salisbury_ Plain fear sinking:  Or when Horse-Coursers turn honest Men,    And _London_ into _York_ is carried;  And out of One you can take Ten,   Oh then, _&c._    When Candlesticks do serve for Bells,    And Frying-pans they do use for Ladles;  When in the Sea they dig for Wells,    And Porridge-pots they use for Cradles:  When Maids forget to go a _Maying_,    And a Man on his Back an Ox can carry;  Or when the Mice with the Cat be playing,    Oh then, _&c._    Good Sir, since you have told me when,    That you're resolv'd for to Marry;  I wish with all my Heart till then,    That for a Wife you still may tarry:  But if all young Men were of your mind,    And Maids no better were preferred;  I think it were when the D----l were blind,    That we and our Lovers should be Married.          Gilderoys _last Farewel. To a New Tune._      [Music]    _Gilderoy_ was a bonny Boy,    Had Roses tull his shun,  His Stockings were made of the finest Silk,    His Garters hanging down:  It was a comely sight to see,    He was so trim a Boy;  He was my Joy and Heart's Delight,    _My Handsom_ Gilderoy.    Oh sike a charming Eye he had,    A Breath as sweet as a Rose,  He never wore a Hiland plad,    But costly silken Cloaths:  He gain'd the Love of Ladies gay,    There's none to him was Coy;  Ah, wa's me, Ise mourn this Day,    _For my Dear_ Gilderoy.    My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26699"],[0,"The Woman and the Right to Vote (#5)"],[1,"common picture is that in which the wife addresses a gathering of  other women, while the husband is busy at home, sweeping the floor  and attempting to pacify the squalling baby. This is the idea which  has been spread by cinematographs and reviews and which has impressed  itself upon the minds of the unthinking  masses, who are incapable  of rising above a superficial view of things.    Nothing, however, is farther from representing her as she really  is. The suffragist is a true product of our era of liberty. Having  received the same education as man, she knows and does not shirk her  responsibilities towards her family; but at the same time she is free  from prejudice and deems it her duty to cooeperate with man in all work  concerning social reform and the public welfare of the community in  which she lives. She believes that for the very reason that there are  duties in the home which are assigned to woman, she has also duties to  perform in public life. The distribution of the work between man and  woman causes no conflict between them in their home and family life,  and there is no reason why there should be any conflict in public  life if each sex is assigned the duties adapted to it.    Being a suffragist does not mean being antagonistic to the family  duties. On the contrary, the suffragist realizes that the happiness  of the family is the foundation of the happiness of society, and she  knows that social distress and vices affect the family and that she  can and should cooeperate with man in the relief of that distress and  the suppression of those vices.    No, the general idea people have of the suffragist is altogether  a wrong one and it is high time that at least the educated and  intelligent correct their views where they are based on prejudices and  ideas belonging to the past. We can not prevent the uneducated masses  from thinking as they did half a century ago; but the fact that many  serious and otherwise progressive persons content themselves with  the opinion of the uneducated shows that here we do not go deep into  subjects and allow ourselves to be carried away by the impressions  of the moment.    Suffragism is a legitimate aspiration, an ideal of our century. It  springs from the philosophy and institutions of the modern world and  from the growing difficulty of the position of woman in the struggle  for existence. It is necessary for her to protect herself and organize,  not to create rivalry and make war upon man, but to become an asset  in the social progress and protect herself from the exploitation and  iniquity of the other social groups, whose victim she would become  if she remained indifferent and took no part in the public life.    As a man of the law and a legislator, I would not think of opposing  this aspiration. I consider it as natural as the right to live  and the right of self-defence. I do not consider it premature for  the Filipino woman to demand this right, as her sisters have done,  successfully in some cases, in other parts of the world. To me it  makes no difference that the number of those now demanding it is  small and insignificant. It would even make no difference to me if the  women of our country did not demand or want it at all. Where rights  fundamentally in accordance with the spirit of our institutions and  with the ideals of our times are to be granted, I would not consult  those who are entitled to demand them, but would give them without the  asking, because it would be just and God wants justice to prevail at  all times and everywhere. I am not a judge, but a legislator, and  it is my first duty to provide for justice, not to administer it,  nor wait for some one to ask for it and some one to object to it.    It is a source of gratification to me that there is a group of women  who, voicing the aspirations of their sex, have dared to approach  our Legislature and call attention to a void in our statutes. This  indicates to me that the consciousness of that right has been born and  has revealed its existence in the Filipino woman, and more than that  I need not know. I do not have to count and classify the women who  think that way. When Rizal espoused the cause of the political rights  of our race, his companions were very few, because in the majority of  his compatriots that consciousness was lying dormant. But it would  be a falsehood and an error to affirm that even at that time Rizal  did not voice the cause of his entire race, and that no attention  should be paid to his demands because he and those with him were  few in number. He knew that his country was oppressed, that he was  defending a just cause, and that he was fighting for the rights of  his fellow-citizens, and he did not stop to reflect whether or not  those fellow-citizens had the consciousness of their rights.    We must conclude, therefore, that the few women who now speak to  us of the rights of their sex and for suffrage, represent all the  Filipino women, unless we wish to insult our women by saying that  they have so little common sense as to oppose the concession to  them of rights that will broaden the scope of their lives and of  their activity in society. It matters but little that the desire  for suffrage appears in its initial stage, in the vague form of an  indefinite proposition: the fact is that there has been an indication  of that desire, and in my judgment the plant has germinated and it is  useless to endeavor to smother it, as it will grow again. The more  we delay female suffrage, the more shall we suffer by it, because  why should we stifle a budding plant instead of allowing it to grow  and in due season produce delicious fruit?    We need not imitate the older nations who have been so slow in  recognizing women's rights. We have neither their traditions nor their  prejudices and our progress need not come by slow revolutions. We  must foster all those peaceful revolutions of ideas that will  result in social justice. Just as we accept the latest inventions  in mechanics, industry, and art, such as the automobile, the dynamo,  and the aeroplane, so must we accept the latest improvements in the  social and political institutions of the most advanced countries.    Female suffrage spells justice and vindication for the modern  woman and we must adopt it forthwith, without unnecessary delay and  formalities. The liberty of worship which gave us religious tolerance;  the popular suffrage which strengthened our collective conscience; the  free public school which emancipated our masses from the tutelage of  the _cacique_: in short, all the achievements of democracy of which we  are so justly proud would not yet be beautiful realities and we would  not be able to enjoy their mature fruits as we now do, if we had been  compelled to feel our way and make many tentative steps instead of at  once entering fully upon our social and political life. We have to move  quickly and anticipate the aspirations of the feminine masses, which  are as yet vague, in order to save us the agitation which otherwise  is sure to come and the justice of which will have to be recognized.    When we are told that our social condition is such that we are not  ready for female suffrage, and that our women are not sufficiently  educated to exercise political rights, I feel like asking whether  we said the same thing when we imported and implanted in our country  the democratic institutions that are the base and foundation of our  present society. Our traditional education was diametrically opposed to  a popular system of government, yet we adopted that form of government,  because we considered it better than the other, more suited to our  interests and to the ideals of the century, and did not worry about  whether or not we were sufficiently educated and prepared for it.    It is more than twenty years now that the free public school has opened  its doors to the women, and education has extended its benefits to them  in the same proportion as to the men. Many of the women educated in  these schools are now wives or mothers, and yet you still ask whether  the Filipina has attained to the maturity necessary for her investment  with political rights. I am sure there is no idea of requiring them  all to be doctors or bachelors of art before we grant them the right  of suffrage.    A political education can not be acquired except by education, just  as you can not learn how to swim except by swimming. The argument  that the Filipina is not sufficiently prepared is a justification of  the attitude of a country which never finds its colonies sufficiently  prepared or educated to exercise the right of sovereignty themselves.    The other day, when I made a flight in a seaplane for the sake of the  experience, I felt--I frankly admit it--some apprehension, a certain  fear of the unknown, but after the first few moments were happily  past, I felt perfectly comfortable and enjoyed the flight through  space and the view of the magnificent landscape far below me. Ah,  it is beautiful to cleave the air like a swallow and to ride upon  the clouds and the winds of heaven, looking down upon the cities and  human dwellings spread like a relief map upon the crystal sheet of the  waters, to traverse enormous distances in a few minutes almost without  noticing it, and to emulate in everything the bird and like the bird  to alight suddenly, without fatigue and physical hardships. When  the voyage was over, I realized that my apprehension and fear had  been unfounded; that it was not more risky to fly through space on  an aeroplane than to speed across country on an automobile, and I  then realized the numerous advantages to be derived from the flying  machine, that product of our time which is destined to revolutionize  not only warfare, but also the pursuits of peace.    The same thing occurs with all new ideas and reforms of a moral and  political order. They are adopted with the instinctive fear,"]]]
