Sir James waited till he saw his son lower his eyes, when he too turned  to the doctor and looked at him fiercely, the two men exchanging a long  questioning glance.    It was a painful silence, but there was virtue in it, for when it was  broken it was by Sir James, who said after drawing a deep breath, \"See  if you can open that window a little farther, Mark.  This place feels  like an oven.\"    Mark sprang to his feet and drew the window a little forward, and then  pushed it outward again, but only back in its former place.    \"Hah!  That's better, my boy,\" said his father, quite cheerfully.  \"Why,  doctor, what a blessing a bucketful of ice would be here--if it wasn't  lukewarm, Dean, eh?\"    The boy addressed tried to laugh at his uncle's joke, but the production  sounded hollow, and the silence recommenced, the doctor cudgelling his  brains the while for something to say that should thoroughly change the  conversation; but he cudgelled in vain.    At last, though, to his great relief, feeling as he did at the time that  all the responsibility of the unpleasant voyage rested on his shoulders,  Sir James cleared his throat as he sat back in a wicker chair mopping  his forehead, and said quietly, \"A beggar, Mark?\"    \"No, father,\" cried Mark eagerly jumping at the chance of saying  something to divert his father's smouldering anger; \"a poor English  sailor.\"    \"Well, the same thing, my boy, and I hope you relieved him--that is, if  he was genuine.\"    \"Oh, he was genuine enough, father,\" cried Mark, and his words almost  tumbled over one another as he related something of the poor fellow's  plight.    \"Tut, tut, tut, tut!\" ejaculated Sir James.  \"Very sad.  Very hard for a  man to be ill away from home.  It would be a charity, doctor, if you saw  the poor fellow in the morning to see if you could do anything for him.\"    \"My dear Sir James, you forget that I am not a professional medico.  Of  course I am willing enough, and will see the poor fellow, but I gather  from what Mark here says that he has passed through all the stages of a  jungle fever caught in some part of the Malay Peninsula, that he has  been left here by the captain of his ship, and as far as my knowledge  goes, the only thing I could recommend would be a sea voyage--say home.\"    \"He said he didn't believe he'd live to reach home,\" cried Dean quickly.    \"Or,\" continued the doctor, \"a journey inland right up into the cool  country away from this tropic malarial port.\"    \"Ah!\" cried Mark excitedly.  \"That's what he said, father, and he came  to us to--\"    Mark stopped short, gazing hard at his father, for a sudden shrinking as  to how Sir James would take his words made him for the time being mute.    \"Well, my boy, what did he say?  Why don't you go on?\"    \"I didn't like to, father,\" faltered the boy.    \"Why not, sir?\"    \"Because--because--\"    \"Well, because--because?\"    \"Because, father, I was afraid that you would think it so unreasonable.\"    \"Humph!  How much do you want, then, eh?  I am afraid your distressed  sailor is a bit of a beggar after all.\"    \"Oh, no, father,\" cried Mark excitedly, and he had quite recovered his  confidence now.  \"The poor fellow spoke as if he were appealing for his  life.\"    \"Was all this genuine, Mark, or the cunning of a practised mendicant--  stop--what do you say, Dean?\"    \"Oh, uncle, I am sure it was genuine.\"    \"Humph!  Yes,\" said Sir James.  \"You are like what your mother was,  boy--easily moved.  Sounds bad, doctor.  What do you say?\"    \"Let us first hear the whole of Mark's story, sir,\" replied the doctor.    \"Right.  Phew!  I don't think it's quite so hot as it was.  Now, Mark,  what more have you to say?\"    The boy addressed was strung up now, and he spoke out firmly and  quickly.    \"He said, father, that he had heard we were going up the country and to  the mountains to where it would be life to him; that he was a sailor, a  handy man; that he should get better quickly, and would work and put his  hand to anything, if we--if we--you, I mean, father--would take him with  you--us, I mean--and--those are not quite the words he said, but that's  what he meant, and I--I--\"    The boy glanced in his father's lowering face and stopped short.    \"And you--\" began Sir James, and Mark's heart sank, for he felt that his  appeal was vain.    In fact, his words sank almost to a whisper as he went on, \"I said I'd  ask you, father, if you would take him.\"    \"Bah!\" burst out Sir James angrily.  \"Unreasonable!  Absurd!  Impossible!  Do you mean to tell me that you wish me to saddle myself  upon this disastrous journey with a sick man, perhaps a dying man?  Why,  boy, have you lost your senses?  Do you mean to tell me that you would  like to take him with us when we are already provided--even supposing  that he was going to get better--provided, I say, with two excellent  servants, strong, healthy, and ready to help us through our troubles?  Answer me, sir.  Don't sit staring at me in that idiotic way.  Now then,  tell me--you first, Dean; you were in this hobble with your cousin.  Would you like to take him?\"    \"Yes, uncle,\" said Dean quietly.    \"Pooh!  That's your mother speaking, boy.  Now you, Mark, if you are not  afraid to speak, as you said just now.  Would you really like to take  him?\"    \"Yes, father; and I am sure if you saw the poor fellow you would feel  the same.\"    \"Well,\" cried Sir James excitedly, \"of all the--the--Here, doctor, I  have come, and I suppose I am to submit to--pooh!--there--it's this hot  weather--let's get away as soon as we can, doctor, and--here, I feel  sure that the boys have encountered some cunning impostor,\" and Sir  James stopped short, and wiped his forehead before continuing, \"Here, I  say, Robertson, what about charity and one's fellow-creatures?  And  don't we read somewhere about helping a lame dog over a stile?\"    \"Yes, Sir James,\" said the doctor, very quietly.    \"To be sure, and I am quite certain that this heat makes me feel  horribly irritable.  These boys take it all as coolly as--what do they  say?--as cucumbers.  Nothing affects them.\"    The two lads stared at each other as they recalled their walk, and burst  into a half hysterical laugh.    \"Why, uncle,\" cried Dean, \"Mark's been horrid all day, and I haven't  been a bit better.\"    \"I am glad to hear it, boy.  Then there's some excuse for me.  Well,  doctor, I suppose you had better go and see this fellow.  I will trust  to your common sense.  Here, stop.  You boys, has this fellow anybody  here who will give him a character?\"    \"Yes,\" they exclaimed together; \"the British Consul.\"    \"Humph!  Come, that sounds respectable.  Well, I don't mean to stir out  till we start up country.  I'd go to-night if I could.  And I leave it  to you to see into this matter.  It wouldn't be Christian-like, would  it, not to lend the poor fellow a hand.  There, as I said before, I  trust to you, _carte blanche_, in that sort of thing to do what you  think best.\"    \"Thank you, Sir James,\" said the doctor gravely.    \"Oh, you thoroughly approve of what I have said, then?\"    \"Thoroughly, sir, and I feel very proud of our boys.\"    And so it came to pass that Daniel Mann--after the doctor had seen him  and had had an interview with the British Consul--was prescribed for  with the news that he would be taken upon the expedition.  Thanks to  this intelligence, he looked at the end of two days quite a different  man, even after hearing from the two keepers the anything but cheering  words that they thought the governor must be mad.    Two days later the party, bag and baggage, were on their way up country  to the extreme point, the rail head, so to speak, of civilisation--the  spot where the advance guard of British troops kept back the black wave  of savagedom, and where waggons and bullocks were to be purchased and  the career of wild adventure was to begin.        CHAPTER FIVE.    DAN'S DOUBTS.    It had been a long slow journey, but every day as they ascended, the  weather, though hot, was tempered by crisp breezes which the doctor  declared to be a joy to breathe.    \"Health, boys,\" he said.  \"Why, can't you feel that you are growing and  enjoying life?  If you want any proof of the healthiness of the country,  look at that sailor.\"    \"Yes; isn't it wonderful!\" cried Mark.    \"Yes,\" said Dean; \"uncle was talking about it only this morning.  He  asked me if I didn't see how his colour was altering.\"    \"Oh, that's only the sun,\" said Mark.    \"Think so?\" said the doctor, smiling.  \"I think it's more than that.\"    \"But it was getting out of that nasty damp oven of a port,\" said Mark.  \"I felt horrible there, and as if I should be ill if we stopped.\"    \"So did I,\" added Dean; \"and didn't it make--\" The boy paused for a  moment as if hesitating.    \"Well, didn't it make what?\"    \"--Mark disagreeable,\" said the boy, with a merry, mischievous look.    \"Oh, come, I like that!\" cried Mark.  \"Why, you must have noticed,  doctor.  Dean was nearly always half asleep, and when he was awake he  did nothing but find fault.\"    A short time after, when the boys were alone, Mark suddenly turned  sharply upon his cousin with, \"I say, why did you stop short when we  were talking to the doctor?\"    Dean turned rather red.    \"What do you mean?\" he asked.    \"What do I mean?  You know.\"    \"I know?\"    \"Yes; you were going to say that father was dreadfully cross all the  time.  Come, confess.\"    \"Well,\" said Dean hesitating, \"I am afraid I did think something of the  kind.\"    \"Afraid!  Why, you did, you beggar, and then packed it all on to my  shoulders.  Hullo, here comes Mann--man--handy man--Daniel Mann--Dan  Mann.  What a rum name!  Hasn't been very handy yet, though.\"    \"I say, don't!  You will have him hear what you say.\"    \"I don't care.  Let him!  I wasn't saying any harm about him, poor chap.  He'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2393"],[0,"His Dog (#5)"],[1,".    But in answer came a swirling patter of feet on the road, a snarl like  a wolf's, a  shape that catapulted through the dark. Sixty pounds of  fur-swathed dynamic muscle smote athwart the shoulders of the man who  was unfastening the cash pocket's pin.    The impact hurled the fellow clean off his crouching balance and sent  him sprawling, face downward, his outflung hands splashing in the  margin of the lake. Before he could roll over or so much as stir, a set  of white fangs met in his shoulder-flesh. And he testified to his  injury by an eldritch screech of pain and terror that echoed far across  the water.    His companion, rallying from the momentary shock, left Ferris and  charged at the prostrate thief's assailant. But Chum met him, with a  fierce eagerness, more than half way.    A true collie--thanks to his strain of wolf bloodfights as does no  other dog. What he lacks in stubborn determination he atones for by  swiftness and by his uncanny brain power.    A bulldog, for example, would have flown to his master's relief quite  as readily as did Chum. But a bulldog would have secured the first  convenient hold and would have hung on to that hold, whether it were at  his victim's throat or only on the slack of his trousers--until someone  should hammer him into senselessness.    Chum--collie-fashion--was everywhere at once, using his brain far more  than his flying jaws. Finding the grip in his foe's shoulder did not  prevent the man from twisting round to grapple him, the collie shifted  that grip with lightning speed, and with one of his gleaming eyeteeth  slashed his opponent's halfturned cheek from eye to chin. Then he bored  straight for the jugular.    It was at this crisis that he sensed, rather  than saw, the other man  rushing  at him. Chum left his fallen antagonist and whirled about to  face the new enemy. As he was still turning, he sprang far to one side,  in bare time to elude a swinging kick aimed at his head.    Then, before the thief could recover the balance endangered by so  mighty a kick, the collie had whirled in and sunk his teeth deep in the  man's calf. The bitten man let out a roar of pain, and smote wildly at  the dog's face with both swinging fists.    Chum leaped back out of range, and then, with the same bewildering  speed, flashed in again and buried his curved fangs in the nearest of  the two flailing forearms.    The first victim of the collie's attack was scrambling to his feet. So  was Link Ferris. Sobered enough to recognize his beloved dog, he also  saw the newrisen thief catch up a broken fence rail, brandish it aloft  and charge upon the collie, who was still battling merrily with the  second man.    To Link it seemed that nothing could save Chum from a backbreaking blow  from the huge club. Instinctively he ran at the wielder of the  formidable weapon. Staggering and sick and two-thirds drunk, Ferris,  nevertheless, made valiant effort to save the dog that was fighting so  gallantly for him.    His lurching rush carried him across the narrow road and to the lake  edge, barely in time to intercept the swinging sweep of the fence rail.  It caught him glancingly across the side. And its force carried him  clean off his none-too-steady feet. Down went Ferris--down and  backward. His body plunged noisily into the water.    Chum had wheeled to face the rail's brandisher. But at sight of his  master's sudden immersion in the lake, he quitted the fray. At top  speed the dog cleared the bank and jumped down into the water in  pursuit of Ferris.    It evidently dawned on both men at once that there had been a good deal  of noise, for what was to have been a silent and decorous holdup. Also  that a raging collie is not a pleasant foe. The racket might well draw  interference from outside. The dog was overhard to kill, and his bites  were murderous. The game had ceased to be worth the candle. By common  impulse the pair took to their heels.    Link Ferris, head down in the cold water, was strangling in his maudlin  efforts to right himself. He dug both hands into the lake-bottom mud  and strove to gain the surface. But the effort was too much for him. A  second frantic heave had better results. And vaguely he knew why.    For Chum had managed to get a firm hold on the shoulder of his master's  coat--twelve inches under water--and had braced himself with all his  wiry strength for a tug which should lift Ferris to the surface.    This added leverage barely made Link's own struggle a success. The  half-drowned man regained his footing. Floundering waist-deep in water,  he clambered up the steeply shelving bank to shore. There at the road's  edge he lay, gasping and sputtering and fighting for breath.    Chum had been pulled under and out of his depth by Link's exertions.  Now, coming to the surface, he swam to shore and trotted up the bank to  the road. Absurdly lank and small, with his soaking coat plastered  close to his slim body, he stood over his prostrate master.    The dog's quick glare up and down the road told him his foes were gone.  His incredible sense of hearing registered the far-off pad-pad-pad of  fast-retreating human feet, and showed him the course the two men were  taking. He would have liked to give chase. It had been a good  fight--lively and exciting withal--and Chum wished he might carry it  into the enemies' own country.    But his god was lying helpless at his feet and making queer sounds of  distress. The dog's place was here. The joy of battle must be foregone.    Solicitously Chum leaned over Ferris and sought to lick the sufferer's  face. As he did so his supersensitive nostrils were smitten by an odor  which caused the collie to shrink back in visible disgust. The sickly,  pungent smell of whisky on Ferris's labored breath nauseated Chum. He  stood, head recoiled, looking down at Link in bewilderment.    There were many things, this night, which Chum did not understand.  First of all, he had been grieved and offended that Ferris should have  locked him in the kitchen instead of taking him along as usual on his  evening stroll. It had been lonely in the unlighted kitchen. Link had  not ordered the dog to stay there. He had simply shut Chum in and left  him.    So, tiring at last of solitude, the collie had leaped lightly out of  the nearest window. The window had been open. Its thin mosquito net  covering had not served in the least as a deterrent to the departing  Chum.    To pick up his master's trail--and to hold to it even when it merged  with a score of others at the edge of the village--had been absurdly  simple. The trail had led to a house with closed doors. So, after  circling the tavern to find if his master had gone out by any other  exit, Chum had curled himself  patiently on the doorstep and had waited  for Link to emerge.    Several people had come in and out while he lay there. But all of them  had shut the door too soon for him to slip inside.    At last Ferris had appeared between his two new friends. Chum had been  friskily happy to see his long-absent god again. He had sprung forward  to greet Link. Then, his odd collie sense had told him that for some  reason this staggering and hiccuping creature was not the master whom  he knew and loved. This man was strangely different from the Link  Ferris whom Chum knew.    Puzzled, the dog had halted and had stood irresolute. As he stood  there, Ferris had stumbled heavily over him, hurting the collie's ribs  and his tender flesh; and had meandered on without so much as a word or  a look for his pet.    Chum, still irresolute and bewildered, had followed at a distance the  swaying progress of the trio, until Link's yell and the attack had  brought him in furious haste to Ferris's rescue.    Link presently recovered enough of his breath to enable him to move.  The ducking in icy water had cleared his bemused brain. Approximately  sober, he got to his feet and stood swaying and dazed. As he rose, his  groping hand closed over something cold and hard that had fallen to the  ground beside him. And he recognized it. So he picked it up and stuck  it into his pocket.    It was a pint flask of whisky--one he had received as a farewell gift  from his two friends as the three had left the tavern. It had been an  easy gift for the men to make. For they were confidently certain of  recovering it a few minutes later when they should go through their  victim's clothes. Dawning intelligence told Link he had not come  through the adventure very badly, after all--thanks to Chum. Ferris  well understood now why the thieves had picked acquaintance with him at  sight of his money, and why they had gotten him drunk.    The memory of what he had escaped gave him a new qualm of nausea. The  loss of his cash would have meant suspended credit at the store and the  leanest three months he had ever known.    But soon the joy in his triumph wiped out this thought.    The native North Jersey mountaineer has a peculiar vein of cunning  which makes him morbidly eager to get the best of anyone at all--even  if the victory brings him nothing worth while.    Link Ferris had had an evening of limitless liquor. He still had a pint  of whisky to take home. And it had cost him not a cent, except for his  first two rounds of drinks.    He had had his spree. He still had all his check money. And he had a  flask of whisky. True, he had been roughly handled. And he had had a  ducking in the lake. But those were his sole liabilities. They were  insignificant by comparison to his assets.    He grinned in smug self-gratulation. Then his eye fell on Chum,  standing ten feet away, looking uncertainly at him.    Chum! To Chum he owed it all! He owed the dog his money, perhaps his  very life. Yes--as he rehearsed the struggle to get out of the lake--he  owed the collie his life as well as his victory over the holdup men. To  Chum!    A great wave of love and gratitude surged up in Ferris. He had a  sloppily idiotic yearning to throw "]]]
