If this _Shake_ is not distinguished  in Instruments, the Fault is in the Ear.[34]    Sec. 8. The third is the _Mezzo-trillo_, or the short _Shake_, which is  likewise known from its Name. One, who is Master of the first and  second, with the Art of beating it a little closer, will easily learn  it; ending it as soon as heard, and adding a little Brilliant. For this  Reason, this _Shake_ pleases more in brisk and lively Airs than in the  _Pathetick_.[35]    Sec. 9. The fourth is the rising _Shake_, which is done by making the Voice  ascend imperceptibly, shaking from Comma to Comma without discovering  the Rise.[36]    Sec. 10. The fifth is the descending _Shake_, which is done by making the  Voice decline insensibly from Comma to Comma, shaking in such Manner  that the Descent be not distinguished. These two _Shakes_, ever since  true[37] Taste has prevailed, are no more in Vogue, and ought rather to  be forgot than learn'd. A nice Ear equally abhorrs the ancient dry  Stuff, and the modern Abuses.    Sec. 11. The sixth is the slow _Shake_, whose Quality is also denoted by  its Name. He, who does not study this, in my Opinion ought not therefore  to lose the Name of a good Singer; for it being only an affected Waving,  that at last unites with the first and second _Shake_, it cannot, I  think, please more than once.[38]    Sec. 12. The seventh is the redoubled _Shake_, which is learned by mixing a  few Notes between the _Major_ or _Minor Shake_, which Interposition  suffices to make several _Shakes_ of one. This is beautiful, when those  few Notes, so intermixed, are sung with Force. If then it be gently  formed on the high Notes of an excellent Voice,[39] perfect in this  rare Quality, and not made use of too often, it cannot displease even  Envy itself.    Sec. 13. The eighth is the _Trillo-Mordente_, or the _Shake_ with a _Beat_,  which is a pleasing Grace in Singing, and is taught rather by Nature  than by Art. This is produced with more Velocity than the others, and is  no sooner born but dies. That Singer has a great Advantage, who from  time to time mixes it in Passages or Divisions (of which I shall take  Notice in the proper Chapter). He, who understands his Profession,  rarely fails of using it after the _Appoggiatura_; and he, who despises  it, is guilty of more than Ignorance.[40]    Sec. 14. Of all these _Shakes_, the two first are most necessary, and  require most the Application of the Master. I know too well that it is  customary to sing without _Shakes_; but the Example, of those who study  but superficially, ought not to be imitated.    Sec. 15. The _Shake_, to be beautiful, requires to be prepared, though, on  some Occasions, Time or Taste will not permit it. But on final Cadences,  it is always necessary, now on the Tone, now on the _Semitone_ above its  Note, according to the Nature of the Composition.    Sec. 16. The Defects of the _Shake_ are many. The long holding-out _Shake_  triumph'd formerly, and very improperly, as now the Divisions do; but  when the Art grew refined, it was left to the Trumpets, or to those  Singers that waited for the Eruption of an _E Viva_! or _Bravo_! from  the Populace. That _Shake_ which is too often heard, be it ever so fine,  cannot please. That which is beat with an uneven Motion disgusts; that  like the Quivering of a Goat makes one laugh; and that in the Throat is  the worst: That which is produced by a Tone and its third, is  disagreeable; the Slow is tiresome; and that which is out of Tune is  hideous.    Sec. 17. The Necessity of the _Shake_ obliges the Master to keep the  Scholar applied to it upon all the Vowels, and on all the Notes he  possesses; not only on Minims or long Notes, but likewise on Crotchets,  where in Process of Time he may learn the _Close Shake_, the _Beat_, and  the Forming them with Quickness in the Midst of the Volubility of Graces  and Divisions.    Sec. 18. After the free Use of the _Shake_, let the Master observe if the  Scholar has the same Facility in disusing it; for he would not be the  first that could not leave it off at Pleasure.    Sec. 19. But the teaching where the _Shake_ is convenient, besides those  on[41] Cadences, and where they are improper and forbid, is a Lesson  reserv'd for those who have Practice, Taste, and Knowledge.          CHAP. IV.    _On_ Divisions.      Tho' _Divisions_ have not Power sufficient to touch the Soul, but the  most they can do is to raise our Admiration of the Singer for the happy  Flexibility of his Voice; it is, however, of very great Moment, that the  Master instruct the Scholar in them, that he may be Master of them with  an easy Velocity and true Intonation; for when they are well executed in  their proper Place, they deserve Applause, and make a Singer more  universal; that is to say, capable to sing in any Stile.    Sec. 2. By accustoming the Voice of a Learner to be lazy and dragging, he  is rendered incapable of any considerable Progress in his Profession.  Whosoever has not the Agility of Voice, in Compositions of a quick or  lively Movement, becomes odiously tiresome; and at last retards the Time  so much, that every thing he sings appears to be out of Tune.    Sec. 3. _Division_, according to the general Opinion, is of two Kinds, the  Mark'd, and the Gliding; which last, from its Slowness and Dragging,  ought rather to be called a Passage or Grace, than a _Division_.    Sec. 4. In regard to the first, the Master ought to teach the Scholar that  light Motion of the Voice, in which the Notes that constitute the  Division be all articulate in equal Proportion, and moderately distinct,  that they be not too much join'd, nor too much mark'd.[42]    Sec. 5. The second is perform'd in such a Manner that the first Note is a  Guide to all that follow, closely united, gradual, and with such  Evenness of Motion, that in Singing it imitates a certain Gliding, by  the Masters called a _Slur_; the Effect of which is truly agreeable when  used sparingly.[43]    Sec. 6. The _mark'd Divisions_, being more frequently used than the others,  require more Practice.    Sec. 7. The Use of the _Slur_ is pretty much limited in Singing, and is  confined within such few Notes ascending or descending, that it cannot  go beyond a fourth without displeasing. It seems to me to be more  grateful to the Ear descending, than in the contrary Motion.    Sec. 8. The _Dragg_ consists in a Succession of divers Notes, artfully  mixed with the _Forte_ and _Piano_. The Beauty of which I shall speak of  in another Place.    Sec. 9. If the Master hastens insensibly the Time when the Scholar sings  the _Divisions_, he will find that there is not a more effectual way to  unbind the Voice, and bring it to a Volubility; being however cautious,  that this imperceptible Alteration do not grow by Degrees into a vicious  Habit.    Sec. 10. Let him teach to hit the _Divisions_ with the same Agility in  ascending gradually, as in descending; for though this seems to be an  Instruction fit only for a Beginner, yet we do not find every Singer  able to perform it.    Sec. 11. After the gradual _Divisions_, let him learn to hit, with the  greatest Readiness, all those that are of difficult Intervals, that,  being in Tune and Time, they may with Justice deserve our Attention. The  Study of this Lesson demands more Time and Application than any other,  not so much for the great Difficulty in attaining it, as the important  Consequences that attend it; and, in Fact, a Singer loses all Fear when  the most difficult _Divisions_ are become familiar to him.    Sec. 12. Let him not be unmindful to teach the Manner of mixing the _Piano_  with the _Forte_ in the _Divisions_; the _Glidings_ or _Slurs_ with the  _Mark'd_, and to intermix the _Close Shake_; especially on the pointed  Notes, provided they be not too near one another; making by this Means  every Embellishment of the Art appear.    Sec. 13. Of all the Instructions relating to _Divisions_, the most  considerable seems to be That, which teaches to unite the _Beats_ and  _short Shake_ with them; and that the Master point out to him, how to  execute them with Exactness of Time, and the Places where they have the  best Effect: But this being not so proper for one who teaches only the  first Rules, and still less for him that begins to learn them, it would  be better to have postponed this (as perhaps I should have done) did I  not know, that there are Scholars of so quick Parts, that in a few  Years become most excellent Singers, and that there is no want of  Masters qualified to instruct Disciples of the most promising Genius;  besides, it appeared to me an Impropriety in this Chapter on _Divisions_  (in which the _Beats_ and _Close Shake_ appear with greater Lustre than  any other Grace) not to make Mention of them.    Sec. 14. Let the Scholar not be suffered to sing _Divisions_ with  Unevenness of Time or Motion; and let him be corrected if he marks them  with the Tongue, or with the Chin, or any other Grimace of the Head or  Body.    Sec. 15. Every Master knows, that on the third and fifth Vowel, the  _Divisions_ are the worst; but every one does not know, that in the best  Schools the second and fourth were not permitted, when these two Vowels  are pronounced close or united.    Sec. 16. There are many Defects in the _Divisions_, which it is necessary  to know, in order to avoid them; for, besides that of the Nose or the  Throat, and the others already mentioned, those are likewise displeasing  which are neither mark'd nor gliding; for in that Case they cannot be  said to sing, but howl and roar. There are some still more ridiculous,  who mark them above Measure, and with Force of Voice, thinking (for  Example) to make a _Division_ upon _A_, it appears as if they said _Ha_,  _Ha_, _Ha_, or _Gha_, _Gha_, _Gha_; and the same upon the other Vowels.  The worst Fault of all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#5)"],[1,"ellan's own campaign in West Virginia.    But the Kanawha campaign, which lasted till November, had only  just begun, with Rosecrans as successor to McClellan (who had been  recalled to Washington for very high command) and with General  Jacob D. Cox leading the force against Gauley. The Confederates  did all they could to keep their precarious foothold. They sent  political chiefs, like Henry A. Wise, ex-Governor of Virginia,  and John B. Floyd, the late Federal Secretary of War, both of whom  were now Confederate brigadiers. They even sent Lee himself in  general commend. But, confronted by superior forces in a difficult  and thoroughly hostile country, they at last retired east of the  Alleghanies, which thenceforth became the frontier of two warring  States.    The campaign in West Virginia was a foregone conclusion. It was not  marked by any real battles; and there was no scope for exceptional  skill of the higher kind on either side. But it made McClellan's  bubble reputation.    McClellan was an ex-captain of United States Engineers who had  done very well at West Point, had distinguished himself in Mexico,  had represented the American army with the Allies in the Crimea,  had written a good official report on his observations there, had  become manager of a big railroad after leaving the service, and had  so impressed people with his ability and modesty on the outbreak  of war that his appointment to the chief command in West Virginia  was hailed with the utmost satisfaction. Then came the two affairs  at Philippi and Rich Mountain, the first of which was planned and  carried out by other men, while the second was, if anything, spoiled  by himself; for here, as afterwards on a vastly greater scene of  action, he failed to strike home at the critical moment.    Yet though he failed in arms he won by proclamations; so much so,  in fact, that _Words not Deeds_ might well have been his motto. He  began with a bombastic address to the inhabitants and ended with  another to his troops, whom he congratulated on having \"annihilated  two armies, commanded by educated and experienced soldiers, intrenched  in mountain fastnesses fortified at their leisure.\"    It disastrously happened that the Union public were hungering for  heroes at this particular time and that Union journalists were itching  to write one up to the top of their bent. So all McClellan's tinsel  was counted out for gold before an avaricious mob of undiscriminating  readers; and when, at the height of the publicity campaign, the  Government wanted to retrieve Bull Run they turned to the \"Man  of Destiny\" who had been given the noisiest advertisement as the  \"Young Napoleon of the West.\" McClellan had many good qualities  for organization, and even some for strategy. An excited press and  public, however, would not acclaim him for what he was but for  what he most decidedly was not.      Meanwhile, before McClellan went to Washington and Lee to West  Virginia, the main Union army had been disastrously defeated by  the main Confederate army at Bull Run, on that vital ground which  lay between the rival capitals.    In April Lincoln had called for three-month volunteers. In May the  term of service for new enlistments was three years. In June the  military chiefs at Washington were vainly doing all that military  men could do to make something like the beginnings of an army out of  the conglomerating mass. Winfield Scott, the veteran General-in-Chief,  rightly revered by the whole service as a most experienced, farsighted,  and practical man, was ably assisted by W. T. Sherman and Irvin  McDowell. But civilian interference ruined all. Even Lincoln had  not yet learned the quintessential difference between that civil  control by which the fighting services are so rightly made the  real servants of the whole people and that civilian interference  which is very much the same as if a landlubber owning a ship should  grab the wheel repeatedly in the middle of a storm. Simon Cameron,  then Secretary of War, was good enough as a party politician, but  all thumbs when fumbling with the armies in the field. The other  members of the Cabinet had war nostrums of their own; and every  politician with a pull did what he could to use it. Behind all these  surged a clamorous press and an excited people, both patriotic  and well meaning; but both wholly ignorant of war, and therefore  generating a public opinion that forced the not unwilling Government  to order an armed mob \"on to Richmond\" before it had the slightest  chance of learning how to be an army.    The Congress that met on the Fourth of July voted five hundred  thousand men and two hundred and fifty million dollars. This showed  that the greatness of the war was beginning to be seen. But the  men, the money, and the Glorious Fourth were so blurred together  in the public mind that the distinction between a vote in Congress  and its effect upon some future battlefield was never realized.  The result was a new access of zeal for driving McDowell \"on to  Richmond.\" Making the best of a bad business, Scott had already  begun his preparations for the premature advance.    By the end of May Confederate pickets had been in sight of Washington,  while McDowell, crossing the Potomac, was faced by his friend of  old West Point and Mexican days, General Beauregard, fresh from the  capture of Fort Sumter. By the beginning of July General Patterson,  a veteran of \"1812\" and Mexico, was in command up the Potomac near  Harper's Ferry. He was opposed by \"Joe\" Johnston, who had taken  over that Confederate command from \"Stonewall\" Jackson. Down the  Potomac and Chesapeake Bay there was nothing to oppose the Union  navy. General Benjamin Butler, threatening Richmond in flank, along  the lower Chesapeake, was watched by the Confederates Huger and  Magruder. Meanwhile, as we have seen already, the West Virginian  campaign was in full swing, with superior Federal forces under  McClellan.    Thus the general situation in July was that the whole of northeastern  Virginia was faced by a semicircle of superior forces which began  at the Kanawha River, ran northeast to Grafton, then northeast  to Cumberland, then along the Potomac to Chesapeake Bay and on  to Fortress Monroe. From the Kanawha to Grafton there were only  roads. From Grafton to Cumberland there was rail as well. From  Cumberland to Washington there were road, rail, river, and canal.  From Washington to Fortress Monroe there was water fit for any  fleet. The Union armies along this semicircle were not only twice  as numerous as the Confederates facing them but they were backed  by a sea-power, both naval and mercantile, which the Confederates  could not begin to challenge, much less overcome. Lee was the military  adviser to the Confederate Government at Richmond as Scott then  was to the Union Government at Washington.    Such was the central scene of action, where the first great battle  of the war was fought. The Union forces were based on the Potomac  from Washington to Harper's Ferry. The Confederates faced them  from Bull Run to Winchester, which points were nearly sixty miles  apart by road and rail. The Union forces were fifty thousand strong,  the Confederate thirty-three thousand. The Union problem was how to  keep \"Joe\" Johnston in the Winchester position by threatening or  actually making an invasion of the Shenandoah Valley with Patterson's  superior force, while McDowell's superior force attacked or turned  Beauregard's position at Bull Run. The Confederate problem was how to  give Patterson the slip and reach Bull Run in time to meet McDowell  with an equal force. The Confederates had the advantage of interior  lines both here and in the semicircle as a whole, though the Union  forces enjoyed in general much better means of transportation. The  Confederates enjoyed better control from government headquarters,  where the Cabinet mostly had the sense to trust in Lee. Scott, on  the other hand, was tied down by orders to defend Washington by  purely defensive means as well as by the \"on to Richmond\" march.  Patterson was therefore obliged to watch the Federal back door  at Harper's Ferry as well as the Confederate side doors up the  Shenandoah: an impossible task, on exterior lines, with the kind  of force he had. The civilian chiefs at Washington did not see  that the best of all defense was to destroy the enemy's means of  destroying _them_, and that his greatest force of fighting _men_,  not any particular _place_, should always be their main objective.    On the fourteenth of June Johnston had destroyed everything useful  to the enemy at Harper's Ferry and retired to Winchester. On the  twentieth Jackson's brigade marched on Martinsburg to destroy the  workshops of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway and to support the  three hundred troopers under J. E. B. Stuart, who was so soon to  be the greatest of cavalry commanders on the Confederate side.  Unknown at twenty-nine, killed at thirty-one, \"Jeb\" Stuart was a  Virginian ex-officer of United States Dragoons, trained in frontier  fighting, and the perfect type of what a cavalry commander should  be: tall, handsome, splendidly supple and strong, hawk-eyed and  lion-hearted, quick, bold, determined, and inspiring, yet always  full of knowledge and precaution too; indefatigable at all times,  and so persistent in carrying out a plan that the enemy could no  more shake him off than they could escape their shadows.    On the second of July the first brush took place at Falling Waters,  five miles south of the Potomac, where Jackson came into touch  with Patterson's advanced guard. As Jackson withdrew his handful  of Virginian infantry the Federal cavalry came clattering down  the turnpike and were met by a single shot from a Confederate gun  that smashed the head of their column and sent the others flying.  Meanwhile Stuart, who had been reconnoitering, came upon a company  of Federal infantry resting in a "]]]
