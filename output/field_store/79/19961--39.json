There are two groups of faculties in his nature that  are lying dormant. His moral and religious powers have not as yet been  brought into action--they have had no food nor exercise, and without  this there can be no development. These, as well as the intellect and  the body, must have their own appropriate food, which must be in kind  with their nature. Moral truth is for the moral powers. This directs us  in our moral relations and obligations to our fellows with whom we may  be associated. Religious truth is for our religious faculties. Now add  to all this the sanction of the authority of God, which is like the  balance-wheel in a watch, regulating and controlling every movement.  Man, thus educated, is prepared to act in harmony with his entire  nature. He can now reach a position of moral, religious, social and  intellectual grandeur worthy of his nature.    Reader, is all of this demanded by the elements of our nature? Then a  revelation of God to man of the knowledge of his being, wisdom,  goodness, power, authority and law was and is a necessity, without which  man must have remained in part uneducated, not perfectly developed.    Is the development of man's religious nature necessary in order to a  full, perfect and harmonious growth? Yes. There neither is, nor can be,  a harmonious growth while any one power is dwarfed by starvation.  Without the knowledge of God man's religious powers must remain dwarfed,  and these can not be fed without a revelation. Are these powers so many  empty buckets, never filled and never to be filled? No. Hence my  conclusion, that man's nature made revelation a necessity, rests upon  the bed-rock of truth. Let him who feels able try to shake my position.      REVELATION PROBABLE.    Our series of essays are such that this requires no argument here. There  are certain analogies that we may, nevertheless, speak of, which will  not _down_ at the bidding of David's fool. The facts stand thus: a  supply for each and every one of our other faculties, sufficient in  quantity for all their necessities, is placed within our reach for their  use. Now let us look at the analogy. I have food to eat, good water to  drink, light for the eye, air to breathe, and a good earth to walk upon  and space in which to move, beauties of nature to admire, its music to  listen to with rapture, and things with their combinations to perceive  and think of.    Now, Mr. Skeptic, you know that man has religious faculties, otherwise  he could never become religious, no more than he could see without eyes  and hear without ears. Now, what say you? Did the author of all things  make a mistake here by conferring upon us a power that would be of no  use? Is this the reason of your rejection of religion? Do you say it is  of no use? Or do you say that the Great Creator and wise and merciful  Provider forgot to give a supply just here? Come! You boast of reason.  Give us your _reason_. Will you? To one or the other of these  conclusions you are irresistibly driven. No other retreat is open. Take  either, and, if true, the harmony of the universe is destroyed. Take  either, and your folly is so plain that it needs no words of mine to  point it out. This is the true conclusion; all analogy points directly  and clearly to the probability and fact of a revelation.      A REVELATION OF THAT WHICH WAS NECESSARY?    To answer this question we must keep in mind the nature of man's  religious powers, and from this deduce the nature of the supply that is  called for. Would the simple idea of the existence of a first cause, or  creator of all things, be sufficient? This idea, by itself, could not  quicken reverence and adoration and a desire to worship, and without  these there is no religion. Would a knowledge, by revelation, of the  power, intelligence, wisdom and goodness of God be sufficient in the  absence of anything more? No. What more? Would it not be enough, in  addition to what you have named, to have a knowledge of our relation to  and dependence upon him for all we enjoy? No; we must have one thing  more shown to us or the whole will be imperfect and unworthy of God as  its author. Religion can not be without something to do, and that  something must be done upon or by the authority of its author. Add this  to all the other items and the system is complete, meeting perfectly the  necessities of man's nature.      THE NECESSARY ORDER OF REVELATION.    The proper arrangement of the various parts of any communication  designed to convey knowledge from one to others, is an important factor  in this subject of _revelation_. Remember \"the clear is the true.\" This  is the case in all methodic arrangements; to this rule there are no  exceptions. The fundamental truth must first be developed. A child must  first be instructed in the rudiments of numbers in order to learn the  science of mathematics, otherwise no sensible progress can be made.  Intricate problems in Euclid are not to be presented to beginners for  solution. So, in religion, the primary thought of the existence of God  is the first great truth made known. Second, we are taught that he  possesses power, wisdom and goodness. This instruction must also be  adapted to the capacity of those who are to be taught. We know that the  very young mind needs more simple instruction than the adult. As, of  necessity, there was a first man, and a time when that first man began  to be, so, of necessity, in the beginning of the life of that man,  however perfectly developed his body might have been, his mind was  infantile--destitute of the first principles of an education.    Object lessons were called for. Here they come in hills and dales, dry  lands and running waters, in trees and vines, in shrubs and grass,  flowers and fruits, beasts, birds and winged insects and creeping  things, and higher up in the sun with his brilliant light, and in the  moon with her paler rays, and in all her attending, sparkling stars.  Here are the objects for man's first lesson. Just now the wise man of  this world, a skeptic, asks the question, Could not the first man, with  all these objects before him, learn by the use of reason the fact that  all these objects originated from a creator? And if he could he  certainly needed no revelation, for, reasoning from nature up to  nature's God, he might then, from the order, beauty and harmony of all,  reach the idea of his character, and from this deduce a knowledge of his  will, and if so a revelation was not necessary. This seems to me very  clear, and you often say \"the clear is the true.\" This is my reason for  rejecting the idea that a revelation was ever made.    Will you, Mr. Christian, grapple with this? I would with pleasure if  there was anything in it to grapple with, but you will see nothing real  in your premises, for objects teach nothing without an instructor. There  lies a brick, pick it up and examine its surface closely; do you, from  it, reach the idea of its maker? No. Yet I know it must have been made,  for I have seen other bricks made, and this resembles them. Very well.  Did you ever see worlds made, and, if so, does our earth resemble them?  But when you saw those bricks made were there not several men engaged in  their manufacture, as well as horses? There is no analogy in your  premises; you beg the question entirely; you take the whole foundation  for granted; your argument is \"as clear as mud.\"    Had you seen others made by only one maker, then and only then could you  by analogy have reached even the idea that ours was made also. Also, the  makers of those bricks may have been of the most base and malignant  disposition, for you can learn nothing of their disposition from the  bricks; they only testify of the skill of their makers--this is all. Do  you not see that you give me nothing to grapple with? The truth is this,  nature gives you no sufficient foundation for religion. Revelation must  of necessity furnish us with that. Without revelation no one can learn  of the existence and character of God. The knowledge of his existence,  power and wisdom might excite reverence, but this alone could not bring  man's religious powers into activity. To this must be added the  knowledge of his goodness and kindness towards, and his love of, those  who are required to worship him. And in addition to all this, there must  be a revelation of the divine will concerning human action, for the term  _worship_ indicates submission and obedience; without this, very  important elements would be wanting, and the system show great  imperfection and want of wisdom--as man could not learn his relation nor  obligation to that great Creator and Preserver of all. But give in  addition the knowledge of man's relation to and dependence upon God,  with a knowledge of his will in the form of law or commands, with  promises of good annexed, resting upon the condition of obedience. Such  a system of revelation would be perfect, fitted to the necessities of  human nature. And you, Mr. Skeptic, have agreed with me, that the nature  of man was true and right. Now, when we find a perfectly straight edge,  and then find another edge that fits it, we know that the last is also  perfectly straight, for straight and crooked edges do not match. Having  already found the kind of a revelation that human nature made necessary,  in my next I shall show that such a revelation is contained in the  Bible. Then as human nature is true, and as the Bible's revelation is  exactly fitted to it, the inevitable conclusion will follow that the  Bible does contain a revelation from God to man.          WHERE SHALL WE TAKE INFIDELS TO GET THEM OUT OF UNBELIEF?      Goethe says it is a law of the demons that they must get out at the same  place where they sneaked in. This is a very suggestive expression.

Be  it known, then, to honest JOHN BULL, that this humble domestic is  expected by the cook to take the entire management of all ROASTS, BOILS,  FISH, and VEGETABLES; i. e. the principal part of an Englishman's  dinner.    The master, who wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a table regularly  well served in the best style, must treat his cook as his friend--watch  over her health[26-*] with the tenderest care, and especially be sure  her taste does not suffer from her stomach being deranged by bilious  attacks.    Besides understanding the management of the spit, the stewpan, and the  rolling-pin, a COMPLETE COOK must know how to go to market, write  legibly, and keep accounts accurately.    In well-regulated private families the most convenient custom seems to  be, that the cook keep a house-book, containing an account of the  miscellaneous articles she purchases; and the butcher's, baker's,  butterman's, green-grocer's, fishmonger's, milkman's, and washing bills  are brought in every Monday; these it is the duty of the cook to  examine, before she presents them to her employer every Tuesday morning  to be discharged.    The advantage of paying such bills weekly is incalculable: among others  the constant check it affords against any excess beyond the sum allotted  for defraying them, and the opportunity it gives of correcting increase  of expense in one week by a prudent retrenchment in the next. \"If you  would live _even_ with the world, calculate your expenses at _half_ your  income--if you would grow _rich_, at _one-third_.\"    It is an excellent plan to have a table of rules for regulating the  ordinary expenses of the family, in order to check any innovation or  excess which otherwise might be introduced unawares, and derange the  proposed distribution of the annual revenue.    To understand the economy of household affairs is not only essential to  a woman's proper and pleasant performance of the duties of a wife and a  mother, but is indispensable to the comfort, respectability, and general  welfare of all families, whatever be their circumstances.    The editor has employed some leisure hours in collecting practical hints  for instructing inexperienced housekeepers in the useful      _Art of providing comfortably for a family;_    which is displayed so plainly and so particularly, that a young lady  may learn the delectable arcana of domestic affairs, in as little time  as is usually devoted to directing the position of her hands on a  _piano-forte_, or of her feet in a _quadrille_--this will enable her to  make the cage of matrimony as comfortable as the net of courtship was  charming. For this purpose he has contrived a Housekeeper's Leger, a  plain and easy plan of keeping accurate accounts of the expenses of  housekeeping, which, with only one hour's attention in a week, will  enable you to balance all such accounts with the utmost exactness; an  acceptable acquisition to all who admit that order and economy are the  basis of comfort and independence.    It is almost impossible for a cook in a large family, to attend to the  business of the kitchen with any certainty of perfection, if employed in  other household concerns. It is a service of such importance, and so  difficult to perform even tolerably well, that it is sufficient to  engross the entire attention of one person.    \"If we take a review of the qualifications which are indispensable in  that highly estimable domestic, a GOOD COOK, we shall find that very few  deserve that name.\"[27-*]    \"The majority of those who set up for professors of this art are of mean  ability, selfish, and pilfering every thing they can; others are  indolent and insolent. Those who really understand their business (which  are by far the smallest number), are too often either ridiculously  saucy, or insatiably thirsty; in a word, a good subject of this class is  a _rara avis_ indeed!\"    \"God sends meat,\"--who sends cooks?[28-*] the proverb has long saved us  the trouble of guessing. Vide _Almanach des Gourmands_, p. 83.    Of what value then is not this book, which will render every person of  common sense a good cook in as little time as it can be read through  attentively!    If the masters and mistresses of families will sometimes condescend to  make an amusement of this art, they will escape numberless  disappointments, &c. which those who will not, must occasionally  inevitably suffer, to the detriment of both their health and their  fortune.    I did not presume to offer any observations of my own, till I had read  all that I could find written on the subject, and submitted (with no  small pains) to a patient and attentive consideration of every preceding  work, relating to culinary concerns, that I could meet with.    These books vary very little from each other; except in the preface,  they are      \"Like in all else as one egg to another.\"    \"_Ab uno, disce omnes_,\" cutting and pasting have been much oftener  employed than the pen and ink: any one who has occasion to refer to two  or three of them, will find the receipts almost always \"_verbatim et  literatim_;\" equally unintelligible to those who are ignorant, and  useless to those who are acquainted with the business of the kitchen.    I have perused not fewer than 250 of these volumes.    During the Herculean labour of my tedious progress through these books,  few of which afford the germ of a single idea, I have often wished that  the authors of them had been satisfied with giving us the results of  their own practice and experience, instead of idly perpetuating the  errors, prejudices, and plagiarisms of their predecessors; the strange,  and unaccountable, and uselessly extravagant farragoes and heterogeneous  compositions which fill their pages, are combinations no rational being  would ever think of either dressing or eating; and without ascertaining  the practicability of preparing the receipts, and their fitness for food  when done, they should never have ventured to recommend them to others:  the reader of them will often put the same _quaere_, as _Jeremy_, in  Congreve's comedy of \"_Love for Love_,\" when _Valentine_ observes,  \"There's a page doubled down in Epictetus that is a feast for an  emperor.--_Jer._ Was Epictetus a real cook, or did he only write  receipts?\"    Half of the modern cookery books are made up with pages cut out of  obsolete works, such as the \"Choice Manual of Secrets,\" the \"True  Gentlewoman's Delight,\" &c. of as much use, in this age of refinement,  as the following curious passage from \"The Accomplished Lady's Rich  Closet of Rarities, or Ingenious Gentlewoman's Delightful Companion,\"  12mo. London, 1653, chapter 7, page 42; which I have inserted in a  note,[29-*] to give the reader a notion of the barbarous manners of the  16th century, with the addition of the arts of the confectioner, the  brewer, the baker, the distiller, the gardener, the clear-starcher, and  the perfumer, and how to make pickles, puff paste, butter, blacking, &c.  together with my _Lady Bountiful's_ sovereign remedy for an inward  bruise, and other ever-failing nostrums,--_Dr. Killemquick's_  wonder-working essence, and fallible elixir, which cures all manner of  incurable maladies directly minute, _Mrs. Notable's_ instructions how to  make soft pomatum, that will soon make more hair grow upon thy head,  \"than Dobbin, thy thill-horse, hath upon his tail,\" and many others  equally invaluable!!!--the proper appellation for which would be \"a  dangerous budget of vulgar errors,\" concluding with a bundle of extracts  from \"the Gardener's Calendar,\" and \"the Publican's Daily Companion.\"    Thomas Carter, in the preface to his \"City and Country Cook,\" London,  1738, says, \"What I have published is almost the only book, one or two  excepted, which of late years has come into the world, that has been the  result of the author's own practice and experience; for though very few  eminent practical cooks have ever cared to publish what they knew of the  art, yet they have been prevailed on, for a small premium from a  bookseller, to lend their names to performances in this art unworthy  their owning.\"    Robert May, in the introduction to his \"Accomplished Cook,\" 1665, says,  \"To all honest and well-intending persons of my profession, and others,  this book cannot but be acceptable, as it plainly and profitably  discovers the mystery of the whole art; for which, though I may be  envied by some, that only value their private interests above posterity  and the public good; yet (he adds), God and my own conscience would not  permit me to bury these, my experiences, with my silver hairs in the  grave.\"    Those high and mighty masters and mistresses of the alimentary art, who  call themselves \"_profess_\" cooks, are said to be very jealous and  mysterious beings; and that if, in a long life of laborious stove-work,  they have found out a few useful secrets, they seldom"]]]
