He should reverence his manhood, even as he expected her to reverence  her womanhood. This is necessary, not only for the good of each  individual, but also for the eternal interest of future generations.    This entrance into the Land of the Teens is a serious, even a dangerous  period, for if you have not had right instruction you may be led, or  fall into habits of wrong doing or thinking. If you are rightly taught  you will begin to have an added reverence for yourselves in that God is  dignifying you with new powers that will bring you more nearly into  co-partnership with himself. These powers, the most sacred of all that  have come to you, need years for development, and should be guarded by  pure thoughts and kept for their holy office of promoting the earthly  usefulness and eternal blessedness of those who hereafter will owe both  earthly and immortal life to you.    I have said that we are not responsible for the dower of virtues or of  vices which are ours by inheritance, but we are responsible for the  inheritances of our children, and this is a most solemn thought. Do you  not begin to see that we cannot value ourselves too highly if we have  the right idea of what our real worth is? We can scarcely overestimate  the results of our own deeds. We may think it does not matter if we do  not always tell the exact truth; if at some times we equivocate and at  others exaggerate, but when we remember that truth is the foundation of  character, and realize that by our little equivocations or exaggerations  we may be weakening the foundations of many who are from us to receive  their talents and tendencies, we begin to see that the matter is a very  serious one. I am sometimes told that young people will not be  influenced by a consideration for the welfare of unborn generations  whose existence is very problematical in their thought; but my  observation is that young folks are much more sensible than we give them  credit for being. More than one young man has said to me: \"I was never  taught that my conduct and thought would impress themselves upon my  children, but now that I see that such is the case, I am sure that I  will hereafter be more careful of my life than I ever have been.\"    This field of investigation is a broad one, and even if you never have  an opportunity to study the subject scientifically you can still be of  incalculable benefit to humanity by ever remembering that you are living  for an earthly, as well as for a heavenly immortality. The young people  who to-day are in the Land of the Teens are they who are determining the  characteristics of the men and women of the Twentieth Century, creating  the standards of thought and action, the methods of business, the level  of morals, in fact the whole status of society in the world of a hundred  years to come.    It is a very wonderful fact that God has so created us that the result  of our deeds is not limited to our own lives, but makes its impress upon  those who are to come after us. We are not separate units, but are links  in a living chain of endless transmission. This fact makes our lives of  far greater consequence than if, in their results, they were limited to  ourselves. If we are anxious concerning the future of our country, we  may take to heart the thought that it will be what we ourselves have  made it. The Bible expresses the same idea in many ways. \"Whatsoever a  man soweth, that shall he also reap,\" does not mean merely that his own  future will be influenced by his conduct, but that his future in his  children will be a record which he himself has made.    Men often make their wills and bequeath to their children their gold or  houses and lands, but sometimes against their wills they bequeath to  their children a bodily dwelling of inferior material, and so poor in  construction that it very soon falls into decay through disease, or in  very early life becomes a tottering ruin. It would seem rather amusing  to us if one should sit down and write his will and say: \"I bequeath to  my daughter Mary my yellow, blotched and pimpled complexion, resulting  from my own bad habits of life. I bequeath to my son John, the effects  of my habits of dissipation in my youth, with a like love for alcoholic  liquors and tobacco. I bequeath to my son Harry my petulant, irritable  disposition, and the rheumatic gout which I have brought upon myself by  disobedience to physical law; and to my daughter Elizabeth, my trembling  nerves and weak moral nature.\" But this is, in truth, what many parents  do, and the children find it a sad, instead of an amusing fact.    On the other hand, if one has led a life of uprightness and morality,  and has obeyed physical law, his children will inherit his physical  vigor, and his moral stamina. It becomes of exceeding great importance  that these facts should be known to the young, in order that they may  endeavor to overcome their own weaknesses, and strengthen their own good  qualities for the sake of future generations.    This heredity, the transmission of the qualities of the parent to the  child, is found among plants and animals as well as in the human race.  The seed of a plant produces another plant of the same kind, and the  farmer knows when he sows wheat, that his harvest will be wheat, and he  should know just as certainly that if he \"sows wild oats\" in his youth  he may expect \"wild oats\" in his children. The character of the food we  eat, the air we breathe, the occupations we follow, the habits we  create, are the forces which shape not only our own destiny, but create  the tendencies of our children.    With these thoughts in mind, the question of the use of narcotics  becomes one of great importance. There are few, if any, tobacco users  who are anxious that their boys should early begin the use of the weed.  But they do not realize the fact that in their own use of it they may  have diminished the vital force of these boys, transmitting a tendency  to disease, or perhaps an appetite for the tobacco itself, and not only  will the boys feel the effects, but the girls as well. As the thought of  men is turned in this direction, proofs are accumulating of the evil  results to the children of tobacco-using parents. A prominent physician  says: \"I have never known an habitual tobacco user whose children did  not have deranged nerves, and sometimes weak minds. Shattered nervous  systems, for generations to come, may be the result of this indulgence.  The children of tobacco-using parents frequently die with infantile  paralysis. I have known two cases in which the crying of the baby could  not be stopped until the tobacco-pipe was placed between its lips.\" Dr.  Pidduck asserts that in no instance is the sin of the father more  strikingly visited upon his children than the sin of tobacco using. \"The  enervation, the hypochondriasis, the hysteria, the insanity, the  dwarfish deformities, the consumption, the suffering lives, and early  deaths of the children of inveterate smokers bear ample testimony to the  feebleness and unsoundness of the constitution transmitted by this  pernicious habit.\"    The effect of alcohol upon the child is equally marked, and from all  sides comes the testimony that the degenerations do not stop with the  individual, but pass on to succeeding generations. Sometimes the  influence is seen in the stunting of the growth, both mentally and  physically. Dr. Langden Downe reports several cases of this sort where  the children had lived to be twenty-two years old and still remained  infants, symmetrical in form, just able to stand beside a chair, utter a  few monosyllabic sounds, and to be amused with toys. Dr. F. R. Lees,  referring to the injury inflicted upon the liver by alcohol, says: \"And  recollect, whatever injury you inflict upon this organ, to your  posterity the curse descends, and as is the father, so are the  children.\" Dr. Kerr asserts that the effects of injury to the mind and  body may not always show themselves in the drinker himself, yet it is  doubtful if his children ever entirely escape the effects in one form or  another. These effects may be manifest in insanity, or in a tendency to  diseases of the stomach, liver, bowels, lungs, or other organs; or with  a like love for alcoholic stimulants. Not only may the child be weak in  body but also in intellect. It is the statement of a score of observant  physicians that the children of intemperate parents are apt to be  feeble in body and weak in mind.    Another very striking thought in this connection is that while the  physical effects may not show in the individual himself, nor in his  children, they may be manifest in the deterioration of his grandchildren  and great-grandchildren. A prominent temperance advocate who was laid up  with rheumatic gout, which is apt to be the result of alcoholic  indulgence, replied to a friend who wondered that he, a drinker of cold  water, should suffer with this disease, \"Yes, my ancestors drank the  liquor and I foot the bills.\" In 1834 the Parliament of the British  House of Commons made a report of intemperance in which they stated that  the evils of alcoholism \"are cumulative in the amount of injury they  inflict, as intemperate parents, according to high medical testimony,  give a taint to their offspring before birth, and the poisonous stream  of spirits is conveyed through the milk of the mother to the infant at  the breast; so that the fountain of life, through which nature supplies  that pure and healthy nutriment of infancy, is poisoned at its very  source, and a diseased and vitiated"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain!

Out in the river, lying at anchor, is the good ship that brought us  here, and not far from her are a couple of others, one of which will  shortly sail for England. Puffing its way between these vessels is a  little white cock-boat of a steamer, that seems tolerably well crowded  with men, whose white sun-helmets and yellow silk coats give quite an  Indian air to the scene. These persons are probably business men coming  over in the ferry-boat from North Shore, where we can see some of their  villas from the wharf.    Lying alongside the wharf are one or two vessels of considerable  tonnage, loading or discharging cargo, while at their respective tees,  whereon are offices and goods-sheds, are several fine steamers of  moderate size. These ply in various directions, taking passengers  chiefly, but also goods. Some go and come between Auckland and  Grahamstown, or Coromandel, in the Hauraki Gulf; others go to Tauranga,  the Bay of Plenty, Napier, Wellington, and the South Island; one or two  go northward to Mahurangi, Whangarei, the Bay of Islands, Whangaroa, and  Mongonui.    The splendid and sumptuously fitted-up Pacific liners that call here  once a month, on their way between \"Frisco,\" Hawaii, Fiji, and Sydney,  are none of them in the harbour at present; but there, at the extreme  end of the wharf, lies _The Hero_, the Sydney packet, and a magnificent  steam-ship is she. All the schooners, cutters, and craft of small  tonnage that fill up the scene, and crowd alongside the wharf and its  tees, are coasting or Island traders.    There is one from the Fijis with cotton, coffee, and fresh tropical  fruits; there is another from the Friendlies with copra and cocoa-nut  fibre, which she will shortly transfer to some ship loading for England;  and there is the _Magellan Cloud_, fresh from a successful whaling  cruise in Antarctic Seas. There is a vessel from Kororareka with coal  and manganese, or kauri-gum; there are others from Mahurangi with lime,  from Whangarei with fat cattle, from Tauranga with potatoes, from  Poverty Bay with wool, from the Wairoa with butter and cheese, from Port  Lyttelton with flour, or raw-hides for the Panmure tannery, from Dunedin  with grain or colonial ale, and so on and so on.    Just off the wharf, and facing the river at either corner of Queen  Street, are two large and handsome hotels, while to right and left on  the river frontage are sundry important commercial edifices. Passing to  the left as we leave the wharf, we come to several extensive  timber-yards, and to a long jetty, used exclusively as a timber-wharf.  The immense piles of sawn timber lying here give to us new-chums some  notion of the vast timber-trade of Northern New Zealand, especially  since we learn that much which goes to the South Island and elsewhere is  shipped direct from Whangaroa, Hokianga, the Kaipara, and other ports in  the north. The road along the river front, here, is shortly brought up  abruptly at the base of a lofty bluff, whereon is a church and other  buildings, near the site of old Fort Britomart.    Retracing our steps, we enter Queen Street, the main street of the city.  All the lower portion of it abutting on to the wharf was, we are told,  reclaimed from swamp and mud only a very few years ago. The street is a  fine one, leading straight away from the river, curving imperceptibly to  the right, and gradually ascending for about a mile, until it branches  off into other streets and roads. Down at the lower end of the street  most of the buildings are of brick and stone; and some of them are of  tolerably fine architecture. There are banks and warehouses and  merchants' stores of all kinds, interspersed with hotels and public  buildings. Higher up Queen Street, and in the cross-streets, stone and  brick edifices are less numerous, and wooden houses more plentiful.    The broad, well-paved thoroughfare is crowded at certain times of the  day with carriages, cabs, buggies, omnibuses, equestrians,  express-carts, waggons, drays, and every species of vehicle. The  side-walks are thronged with passengers, who pass up and down under the  awnings that stretch from the houses across the wide pavement. Many of  the shop-windows would do no discredit to Oxford Street or the Strand,  either as respects their size or the goods displayed in them.    Some distance up Queen Street, and turning a little out of it, is the  Market House, where a very fine show of fruit, vegetables, and other  eatables is frequently to be seen; and then there is the United Service  Hotel, at the corner of Wellesley Street, which is a structure that  Aucklanders point to with pride, as evidence of their progress in street  architecture. At night, when the gas is lit in the streets, the shops,  and the saloons, and one mingles with the crowd that throngs them, or  pours into the theatre, the Choral Hall, the Mechanics' Institute, the  Oddfellows' Hall, or other places of amusement, instruction, or  dissipation, it is almost possible sometimes to imagine oneself back in  the old country, in the streets of some English town.    New-chums are able to notice some of the peculiarities of Auckland  street-life, wherein it most differs from an old-country town. These  arise principally from that absence of conventionality, which, certainly  in many external things, is the prerogative of colonists. There is a  mingling of people who seem on terms of perfect equality, and who yet  present the most extraordinary difference in appearance. The gentleman  and the roughest of roughs may happen to get together on the same piece  of work, and when their temporary chum-ship ends the one cannot entirely  cut the other, such being a course quite inadmissible with colonial  views of life. Only one man _may_ be scouted by any one, and that is the  loafer.    Of course there are good people here who would fain introduce all the  class barriers that exist in the old country; but they cannot do more  than form little cliques and coteries, which are constantly giving way  and being broken down under the amalgamating process of colonization.  Where these offer most resistance to the levelling influence is where  they are cemented by religious denominational spite, which is,  unhappily, very prevalent in Auckland.    This general fusion of all sorts of people together produces a very  amiable and friendly state of things. Etiquette is resolved into simple  courtesy, not very refined, perhaps, but which is sufficient \"between  man and man,\" as Micawber would say. Prejudice must not be entertained  against any man on account of his birth, connections, education,  poverty, or manner of work; he is \"a man for a' that,\" and entitled to  the same consideration as the more fortunate individual who possesses  what he lacks. Only if he be a loafer, or dishonest, or otherwise  positively objectionable, will any man find himself under the ban of  colonial society. And this society is not a mere set of wealthy  exclusives banded together against the rest of the world; it comprehends  everybody.    One sees in the streets abundant evidence of these conditions of social  relationship. In the first place, costume goes for little or nothing.  Men--I am coming to your sex presently, ladies!--men wear just what they  please at all times and in all places, and without remark from others.  One sees men apparelled in all sorts of ways; and it would be impossible  to guess at a man's condition from his coat, hereaway.    In Queen Street once, I saw a well-dressed and thriving store-keeper  touch his hat to a ragged, disreputable-looking individual, who was  carrying a hod full of bricks, where some building operations were going  on. It was a sudden impulse of old habit, I suppose, which had wrung  that very uncolonial salute from the sometime valet to his former  master, in whose service he had originally come out. I knew of one case  where master and servant actually came to change places, and I may add,  to their mutual advantage eventually.    A man would not be likely to receive an invitation to the governor's  ball unless he had some pretensions to gentility, or was locally  important. Yet, I suppose that the recipient of such an invite might  turn up at Government House in a grey jumper and moleskins, if he were  so minded, and would pass unquestioned. In such a case it would only be  surmised that Mr. So-and-so was \"not doing very well at present.\"    Women, as a rule, dress \"to death;\" and the more gorgeous the toilette  the more likely is it that the wearer is unmarried, and a worker of some  sort. The merest Irish slut can earn her ten shillings a week as a  domestic, besides being found in everything; and better-class girls get  proportionately more; so it is not surprising that they can clothe  themselves in fine raiment. But there is no rule to go by--the  expensively dressed woman may be either mistress or maid, and the plain  cotton gown may clothe either as well. Only one thing is certain, the  Auckland woman of any class will dress as well as she knows how, on her  own earnings or her husband's.    We new-chums observe one or two peculiarities of this kind as we stroll  about the city, and they are explained to us by our colonial friend.  Some extremely dowdy females we see riding in a barouche are the wife  and daughters of a high official, who is stingy to his woman-kind, so  they say. Two youths we pass are in striking contrast, as they walk  along arm-in-arm. One is got up according to the fullest Auckland idea  of Bond Street foppery, while the other prefers to go about in very  \"creeshy flannen;\" yet the two sit at the same desk in one of the banks,  and earn the same salary; and neither they themselves, nor anyone else,  seems to notice any peculiarity in the costume of either.    Then comes along a more remarkable pair still: a \"lady\" and a \"man\"  apparently, or so they"]]]
