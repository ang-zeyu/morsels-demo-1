THE SIGNS AND CHANGES OF PUBERTY    In the boy the signs of puberty are the growth of hair on the skin  covering the pubes and in the armpits. Chest and arms broaden, the  frame grows more angular, the masculine proportions more pronounced.  The vocal cords grow longer and lower the pitch of the voice. Hair  grows on chin, upper lip, cheeks, and often on the body surface.                               THE SEXUAL MORAL LAW    The sexual moral law is the same for both sexes, and equally binding.  It may be summed up as follows: \"Your sexual urges, instincts and  desires should never consciously injure an individual human being or  mankind in general. They should be exercised to further the value and  happiness of both.\"                        THE MALE ADOLESCENT AND CONTINENCE    The perfect carrying out of this general moral law implies continence  on the part of the male adolescent until marriage. Continence is  positive restraint under all circumstances. Strict continence is  neither injurious to health, nor does it produce impotence. While  self-denial is difficult, since the promptings of nature often seem  imperious, it is not impossible. It is certain that no youth will  suffer, physically, by remaining sexually pure. The demands which  occur during adolescence are mainly abnormal, due to the excitements  of an overstimulating diet, pornographic literature and art, and the  temptations of impure association.                              WHY YOUNG MEN GO WRONG    Foul thoughts, once they enter the mind, corrode it. The sensual  glance, the bawdy laugh, the ribald jest, the smutty story, the  obscene song may be met with on street corner, in the car, train,  hotel lobby, lecture hall and workshop. Mental unchastity ends in  physical unchastity. The habit common to most adolescent boys and  young men of relating smutty stories, repeating foul jokes and making  indecent allusions destroys respect for virtue. In addition there are  such direct physical causes of undue adolescent sexual excitement as  constipation and alcoholism, and such mental ones as nervous  irritability.    To the constant discussion and speculation regarding sex and its  mysteries by the adolescent young male, must be added the artificial  idea that idle prattling on the subject is a sign of \"manhood.\" Thus  many young men whose natural trend is in the direction of decency and  right sexual living, \"step out\" or \"go to see the girls,\" as the  phrase is, because they think that otherwise \"they are not real men.\"  More subtle in its evil effect, yet somewhat less dangerous  physically, perhaps, than the professional prostitute is the lure of  the \"hidden\" prostitute, who carefully conceals her derelictions, and  publicly wraps herself in a mantle of virtue.                                   PROSTITUTION    The training of the average male mind in impure language and thought  during boyhood and adolescence, the cultivation of his animal at the  expense of the moral nature, often leads the adolescent to seek  satisfaction by frequenting the prostitute.    _Prostitution_, known as the \"social evil,\" is promiscuous unchastity  for gain. It has existed in all civilized countries from earliest  times. Prostitution abuses the instinct for reproduction, the basic  element of sex, to offer certain women a livelihood which they prefer  to other means. Love of excitement, inherited criminal propensities,  indolence and abnormal sex appetite are first causes of prostitution.  Difficulty in finding work, laborious and ill-paid work, harsh  treatment of girls at home, indecent living among the poor, contact  with demoralizing companions, loose literature and amusements are  secondary causes. They all contribute to debauch male and female youth  and lead it to form dangerous habits of vicious sensual indulgence.    Prostitution seems inseparable from human society in large  communities. The fact is acknowledged in the name given it, \"the  necessary evil.\" Regulation and medical control only arrest in a  degree the spread of venereal diseases to which prostitution gives  rise. The elementary laws on which prostitution rests seems to be  stronger than the artificial codes imposed by moral teaching. It is an  evil which must be combatted _individually_. Men are principally  responsible, in one way or another, for the existence of the social  evil. In the case of the young man, abstention is the only cure for  the probable results of indulging his animal passions by recourse to  the prostitute.    Prostitution, both public and private is the most dangerous menace to  society at large. It is the curse of individual young manhood because  of the venereal diseases it spreads. One visit to a house of  prostitution may ruin a young man's health and life, and millions of  human beings die annually from the effects of poison contracted in  these houses. \"Wild oats\" sown in company with the prostitute usually  bear fruit in the shape of the most loathsome and destructive sex  disorders.    The development of self-control, the avoidance of impure thoughts and  associations, the cultivation of the higher moral nature instead of  the lower animal one, and, finally, _marriage_, should prevent the  young man from falling into prostitution. All the state and medical  regulation in the world will not protect him from the venereal  diseases he is so apt to acquire by such indulgence.                                     FREE LOVE    Free love is the doctrine of _unrestrained choice, without binding  ties_, in sexual relations. For altogether different reasons, however,  it is quite as objectionable as prostitution for the young man. It may  offer better hygienic guarantees. But it is a sexual partnership which  is opposed to the fundamental institution of _marriage_, on which  society in general is based throughout the world. And, aside from the  fact that it is a promiscuous relationship not sanctioned by law or  society, it is seldom practically successful. It cannot admit of true  love without bitter jealousies.                                        CHAPTER VI                         SEX IN THE ADOLESCENT FEMALE                          (FROM PUBERTY TO MATURITY)      Adolescence in the girl is the period when she develops into a woman.  It is that stage in female life embraced between the ages of twelve or  fourteen and twenty-one years. Elasticity of body, a clear complexion,  and a happy control of her feelings should mark the young girl at this  time, if she has been so fortunate as to escape the dangers and  baneful influences of childhood and infancy. Her numerous bodily  functions should be well performed. Thus constituted she should be in  a condition to take up her coming struggle with the world, and the sex  problem it will present.                                      PUBERTY    It has been noticed that in the case of girls, puberty usually occurs  earlier in brunettes than in blondes. In general, it makes its  appearance earlier in those of a nervous or bilio-nervous temperament  than in those whose temperament is phlegmatic or lymphatic. In the  United States fourteen and a half years is the usual age of puberty in  girls. In tropical lands, however, it is not uncommon for a girl to be  a mother at twelve. Country girls (and boys) usually mature several  months or a year later than those living in cities. Too early a  puberty in girls may well arouse concern. It usually indicates some  inherent constitutional weakness. Premature puberty is often  associated with premature decay.                         THE SIGNS AND CHANGES OF PUBERTY    In the girl the sign of puberty is the growth of hair about the pubes,  private organs and armpits. Her whole frame remains more slender than  in the male. Muscles and joints are less prominent, limbs more rounded  and tapering. Internal and external organs undergo rapid enlargement,  locally. The _mammae_ (the breasts) enlarge, the ovaries dilate, and a  periodical uteral discharge (menstruation) is established.                                   MENSTRUATION    No young girl should feel alarmed if, owing to the negligence of her  parents or guardians to prepare her, she is surprised by this first  flow from the genital organs. Puberty is the proper time for the  appearance of menstruation. This is the periodical development and  discharge of an ovule (one or more) by the female, accompanied by the  discharge of a fluid, known as menses or catamenia. Menstruation, in  general good health, should occur about every twenty-eight days, or  once in four weeks. This rule, however, is subject to great variation.  Menstruation continues from puberty to about the forty-fifth year,  which usually marks the _menopause_, or \"change of life.\" When it  disappears a woman is no longer capable of bearing children. Her  period of fertility has passed. In rare cases menstruation has stopped  at 35, or lasted till 60.                     HINTS FOR OBSERVANCE DURING MENSTRUATION    When the period arrives a girl or woman has a feeling of discomfort  and lassitude, there is a sense of weight, and a disclination for  society. Menstruation should not, however, be regarded as a nuisance;  a girl's friends respect her most when she is \"unwell.\" She should  keep more than usually quiet while the flow continues, which it will  do for a few days. Also, she should avoid all unnecessary fatigue,  exposure to wet or to extremes of temperature. Some girls are guilty  of the crime of trying to arrest the menstruation flow, and resorting  to methods of stopping it. Why? In order to attend a dance or pleasure  excursion! Lives have been lost by thus suppressing the monthly flux.  Mothers should instruct their daughters when the menses are apt to  begin, and what their function is. During menstruation great care must  be taken in using water internally.

Totonteac[12]  is ordinarily thought to be the same as Tusayan, but it may have  included some of the southern pueblos now in ruins west of Zuni.    Having determined that the line of Verde ruins was continued into the  Red-rock country, it was desirable to see how the latter compared with  those nearer Tusayan. This necessitated reexamination of many ruins in  Verde valley, which was my aim during the most of June. I followed  this valley from the cavate dwellings near Squaw mountain past the  great ruin in the neighborhood of Old Camp Verde, the unique Montezuma  Well, to the base of the Red-rocks. Throughout this region I saw, as  had been expected, no change in the character of the ruins great  enough to indicate that they originally were inhabited by peoples  racially different. Stopped from further advance by a barrier of  rugged cliffs, I turned westward along their base until I found  similar ruins, which were named Palatki and Honanki. Having satisfied  myself that there was good evidence that the numbers of ancient  people were as great here as at any point in the Verde valley and that  their culture was similar, I continued the work with an examination of  the ruins north of the Red-rocks, where there is substantial evidence  that these were likewise of the same general character.    The last two months of the summer, July and August, 1895, were devoted  to explorations of two Tusayan ruins, called Awatobi and Sikyatki. In  this work, apparently unconnected with that already outlined, I still  had in mind the light to be shed on the problem of Tusayan origin. The  question which presented itself was: How are these ruins related to  the modern pueblos? Awatobi was a historic ruin, destroyed in 1700,  and therefore somewhat influenced by the Spaniards. Many of the  survivors became amalgamated with pueblos still inhabited. Its kinship  with the surviving villagers was clear. Sikyatki, however, was  overthrown in prehistoric times, and at its destruction part of its  people went to Awatobi. Its culture was prehistoric. The discovery of  what these two ruins teach, by bringing prehistoric Tusayan culture  down to the present time and comparing them with the ruins of Verde  valley and southern Arizona, is of great archeological interest.    While engaged in preparing this report, having in fact written most of  it, I received Mr Cosmos Mindeleff's valuable article on the Verde  ruins,[13] in which special attention is given to the cavate lodges  and villages of this interesting valley. This contribution anticipates  many of my observations on these two groups of aboriginal habitations,  and renders it unnecessary to describe them in the detailed manner I  had planned. I shall therefore touch but briefly on these ruins,  paying special attention to the cliff houses of Verde valley, situated  in the Red-rock country. This variety of dwelling was overlooked in  both Mearns' and Mindeleff's classifications, from the fact that it  seems to be confined to the region of the valley characterized by the  red-rock formation, which appears not to have been explored by them.  The close resemblance of these cliff houses to those of the region  north of Tusayan is instructive, in view of the ground, well taken, I  believe, by Mr Mindeleff, that there is a close likeness between the  Verde ruins and those farther north, especially in Tusayan.          RUINS IN VERDE VALLEY    CLASSIFICATION OF THE RUINS      The ruined habitations in the valley of the Rio Verde may be  considered under three divisions or types, differing in form, but  essentially the same in character. In adopting this classification,  which is by no means restricted to this single valley, I do not claim  originality, but follow that used by the best writers on this subject.  My limitation of the types and general definitions may, however, be  found to differ somewhat from those of my predecessors.    The three groups of ruins in our Southwest are the following:      I--Pueblos, or Independent habitations.   II--Cliff Houses        }  III--Cavate Dwellings    } Dependent habitations.    In the first group are placed those ancient or modern habitations  which are isolated, on all sides, from cliffs. They may be situated in  valleys or on elevations or mesas; they may be constructed of clay,  adobe, or stone of various kinds, but are always isolated from cliffs.  They are single or multiple chambered, circular or rectangular in  shape, and may have been built either as permanent habitations or as  temporary outlooks. Their main feature is freedom, on all sides except  the foundation, from cliffs or walls of rock in place.    The second group includes those not isolated from natural cliffs, but  with some part of their lateral walls formed by natural rock in situ,  and are built ordinarily in caverns with overhanging roofs, which the  highest courses of their walls do not join. Generally erected in  caves, their front walls never close the entrances to those caverns.  This kind of aboriginal buildings may, like the former, vary in  structural material; but, so far as I know, they are not, for obvious  reasons, made of adobe alone.    The third kind of pueblo dwellings are called cavate dwellings or  lodges, a group which includes that peculiar kind of aboriginal  dwelling where the rooms are excavated from the cliff wall, forming  caves, where natural rock is a support or more often serves as the  wall itself of the dwelling. The entrance may be partially closed by  masonry, the floor laid with flat stones, and the sides plastered with  clay; but never in this group is there a roof distinct from the top of  the cave.    Naturally cavate dwellings grade into cliff houses, but neither of  these types can be confounded with the first group, which affords us  no difficulty in identification. All these kinds of dwellings were  made by people of the same culture, the character of the habitation  depending on geological environment.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. XCI^_a_    CAVATE DWELLINGS--RIO VERDE]    In Verde valley, villages, cliff houses, and cavate dwellings exist  together, and were, I believe, contemporaneously inhabited by a people  of the same culture.    These types of ancient habitations are not believed to stand in the  relationship of sequence in development; nor is one simpler or less  difficult of construction than the others. Cliff houses display no  less skill and daring than do the villages in the plain, called  pueblos. The cavate dwellings are likewise a form of habitation which  shows considerable workmanship, and are far from caves like those  inhabited by \"cave men.\" These dwellings were laboriously excavated  with rude implements; had floors, banquettes, windows, walled  recesses, and the like. It is hardly proper to regard them, as less  difficult to construct than pueblos or cliff houses.    Cavate dwellings, like villages or cliff houses, may be single or  multiple, single or many chambered, and a cluster of these troglodytic  dwellings was, in fact, as truly a village as a pueblo or cliff house.  The same principle of seeking safety by crowding together held in all  three instances; and this very naturally, for the culture of the  inhabitants was identical. I shall consider only two of the three  types of dwellings in Verde valley, namely, the second and third  groups.    It has, I think, been conclusively shown by Mr Cosmos Mindeleff, so  far as types of the first group of ruins on the Verde are concerned,  that they practically do not differ from the modern Tusayan pueblos.  The remaining types, when rightly interpreted, furnish evidence of no  less important character. Notwithstanding Mindeleff's excellent  descriptions of the cavate dwellings of this region, already cited, I  have thought it well to bring into prominence certain features which  seem to me to indicate that this form of aboriginal dwelling was high  in its development, showing considerable skill in its construction,  and was fashioned on the same general plan as the others. For this  demonstration I have chosen one of the most striking clusters in Verde  valley.      CAVATE DWELLINGS    The most accessible cavate dwellings in Verde valley (plate XCI _a_)  are situated on the left bank of the river, about eight miles  southward from Camp Verde and three miles from the mouth of Clear  creek. The general characteristics of this group have been well  described by Mr Mindeleff in the Thirteenth Annual Report of the  Bureau, so that I need but refer to a few additional observations made  on these interesting habitations.[14]    These cavate lodges afford a fair idea of the best known of these  prehistoric dwellings in this part of Arizona. Although Verde valley  has many fine ranches, the land in immediate proximity to these ruins  is uncultivated. The nearest habitation, however, is not far away, and  it is not difficult to find guides to these caves, so well known are  they to the inhabitants of this part of the valley. It did not take  long to learn that any investigations which I might attempt there had  been anticipated by other archeologists and laymen, for many of the  rooms had been rifled of their contents and their walls thrown down,  while it was also evident that some careful excavations had been made.    There is, however, abundant opportunity for more detailed scientific  work than has yet been attempted on these ruins, and what has thus far  been accomplished has been more in the nature of reconnoissance. The  cemeteries and burial places of the prehistoric people of the cavate  dwellings are yet to be discovered, and it is probable, judging from  experience gained at other ruins, that when they are found and  carefully investigated much light will be thrown on the character of  ancient"]]]
