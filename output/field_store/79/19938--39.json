And had Buell pursued the enemy in his retreat       from Nashville, without delay, into a commanding position in       North Alabama, on the railroad between Chattanooga and Decatur,       the rebel government at Richmond would necessarily have been       obliged to retreat to the cotton States. I am fully satisfied       that the true policy of General Halleck is to strengthen Grant's       column by such a force as will enable him at once to seize the       Memphis and Charleston Railroad, as it is the readiest means of       reducing Island 10, and all the strongholds to Memphis.    In October, 1862, observing the preparations for a naval attack upon  Vicksburg, Miss Carroll again addressed the Secretary of War in the  following memorial:         As I understand an expedition is about to go down the river, for       the purpose of reducing Vicksburg, I have prepared the enclosed       map in order to demonstrate more clearly the obstacles to be       encountered in the contemplated assault. In the first place, it       is impossible to take Vicksburg in the front without too great a       loss of life and material, for the reason that the river is only       about half a mile wide, and our forces would be in point-blank       range of their guns, not only from their water-batteries which       line the shore, but from the batteries that crown the hills,       while the enemy would be protected from the range of our fire.         By examining the map I enclose, you will at once perceive why a       place of so little apparent strength has been enabled to resist       the combined fleets of the Upper and Lower Mississippi. The most       economical plan for the reduction of Vicksburg now, is to push a       column from Memphis or Corinth down the Mississippi Central       Railroad to Jackson, the capital of the State of Mississippi. The       occupation of Jackson, and the command of the railroad to New       Orleans, would compel the immediate evacuation of Vicksburg, as       well as the retreat of the entire rebel army east of that line;       and by another movement of our army from Jackson, Miss., or from       Corinth to Meridan, in the State of Mississippi, on the Ohio and       Mobile Railroad, especially if aided by a movement of our       gun-boats on Mobile, the Confederate forces, with all the       disloyal men and slaves, would be compelled to fly east of the       Tombigbee. Mobile being then in our possession, with 100,000 men       at Meridan, would redeem the entire country from Memphis to the       Tombigbee River. Of course I would have the gun-boats with a       small force at Vicksburg, as auxiliary to this movement. With       regard to the canal, Vicksburg can be rendered useless to the       Confederate army upon the very first rise of the river; but I do       not advise this, because Vicksburg belongs to the United States,       and we desire to hold and fortify it, for the Mississippi River       at Vicksburg and the Vicksburg and Jackson Railroad will become       necessary as a base for our future operations. Vicksburg might       have been reduced eight months ago, as I advised after the fall       of Fort Henry, and with much more ease than it can be done       to-day.    It will be recollected that after a month's attack upon Vicksburg,  commencing June 28, 1862, by the combined Farragut fleet, Porter  mortar flotilla and the gun-boat fleet under Capt. C. H. Davis, the  bombardment of the city was suspended, it being found impossible to  capture and hold it with the forces at command.    In October, 1862, Grant was appointed to the command of the forces  from New Orleans to Vicksburg under the name of the \"Department of  Tennessee,\" and the capture of this \"Gibraltar of the Confederacy\" was  once more attempted. This was the period of Miss Carroll's memorial  above given, and the results proved the wisdom of her suggestions, as  it was not until the army, by an attack upon its rear, were enabled to  capture this stronghold, July 4, 1863, more than a year after the  first demand of Farragut's fleet for its capitulation. Had it been  attacked immediately after the fall of Fort Henry, according to Miss  Carroll's plan, many lives, costly munitions of war, and much valuable  time would have alike been saved. Miss Carroll's claim before Congress  in connection with the Tennessee campaign of 1862, shows that the  Military Committee of the United States Senate at the third session of  the 41st Congress, reported (document 337), through Senator Howard,  that Miss Carroll \"furnished the Government the information which  caused the change of the military expedition which was preparing in  1861 to descend the Mississippi, from that river to the Tennessee  River.\" The same committee of the 42d Congress, second session  (document 167), reported the evidence in support of this claim. For  the House report of the 46th Congress, third session, see document  386.[8]    No fact in the history of our country is more clearly proved than that  its very existence is due to the military genius of Miss Carroll, and  no more shameful fact in its history exists, than that Congress has  refused all recognition and reward for such patriotic services because  they were rendered by a woman. While in the past twenty years  thousands of men, great and small, have received thanks and rewards  from the country she saved--for work done in accordance with her  plans--Grant, first made known at Donelson, having twice received the  highest office in the gift of the nation--having made the tour of the  world amid universal honors--having received gifts of countless value  at home and abroad--Miss Carroll is still left to struggle for a  recognition of her services from that country which is indebted to her  for its very life.      DOROTHEA DIX,    GOVERNMENT SUPERINTENDENT OF NURSES.    Upon the breaking out of the war, Miss Dix, who for years had been  engaged in philanthropic work, saw here another requirement for her  services and hurried to Washington to offer them to her country. She  found her first work in nursing soldiers who had been wounded by the  Baltimore mob.[9] Upon June 10, 1861, she received from the War  Department, Simon Cameron at that time its head, an appointment as the  Government Superintendent of Women Nurses. Secretary Stanton,  succeeding him, ratified this appointment, thus placing her in an  extraordinary and exceptional position, imposing numerous and onerous  duties, among them that of hospital visitation, distributing supplies,  managing ambulances, adjusting disputes, etc. But while appointed to  this office by the Government, Miss Dix found herself as a member of a  disfranchised class, in a position of authority without the power of  enforcing obedience, and the subject of jealousy among hospital  surgeons, which largely militated against the efficiency of her  work.[10]      ELIZABETH BLACKWELL, M.D.    THE SANITARY COMMISSION.    It has been computed that since the historic period, fourteen thousand  millions of human beings have fallen in the wars which men have waged  against each other. From careful statistics it has also been estimated  that four-fifths of this loss of life has been due to privation,  exposure, and want of care. At an early day the mortality from  sickness was evidently far greater than the above estimate; as late as  the Crimean War, this mortality reached seven-eighths of the whole  number of deaths. Military surgery was formerly but little understood.  The wounded and sick of an army were indebted to the chance aid of  friend or stranger, or were left to perish from neglect. Nothing has  ever been held so cheap as human life, unless, indeed, it were human  rights. But even from times of antiquity we read of women, sometimes  of noble birth, who followed the soldiers to the field, treating the  wounds of friend or lover with healing balms or rude surgical  appliance. To woman is the world indebted for the first systematic  efforts toward relief, through the establishment of hospitals for sick  or wounded soldiers. As early as the fifth century, the Empress Helena  erected hospitals on the routes between Rome and Constantinople, where  soldiers requiring it, received careful nursing.    In the ninth century an order of women, who consecrated themselves to  field work, arose in the Catholic Church. They were called Beguines,  and everywhere ministered to the sick and wounded of the armies of  Continental Europe during its long period of devastating wars.    To Isabella of Spain,[11] she who sold her jewels to fit Columbus for  the discovery of a New World, is modern warfare most indebted for a  mitigation of its horrors, through the establishment of the first  regular Camp Hospitals. During her war with the Moors she caused a  large number of tents to be furnished at her own charge, with the  requisite medicines, appliances, and attendants for the wounded and  sick of her army. These were known as the \"Queen's Hospitals,\" and  formed the inception of all the tender care given in army hospitals by  the most enlightened nations of to-day.    It is but a few years since Christendom was thrilled by the heroism of  a young English girl of high position, Florence Nightingale, who  having passed through the course of training required for hospital  nurses, voluntarily went out to the Crimea at the time when English  soldiers, wounded and sick, were dying by scores and thousands without  medicine or care, broke over the red-tape rules of the army, and with  her corps of women nurses, brought life in place of death,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28056"],[0,"Music and Some Highly Musical People (#5)"],[1,"robably, be  tolerated even in circles of the least musical culture.    Of these ancient instruments the Boston \"Folio\" thus speaks:--         \"The Egyptian flute was only a cow's-horn, with three or       four holes in it; and their harp, or lyre, had only three       strings. The Grecian lyre had only seven strings, and was       very small, being held in one hand. The Jewish trumpets that       made the walls of Jericho fall down were only rams'-horns:       their flute was the same as the Egyptian. They had no other       instrumental music but by percussion, of which the greatest       boast was made of the psaltery,--a small triangular harp, or       lyre, with wire strings, and struck with an iron needle or       stick. Their sackbut was something like a bagpipe; the       timbrel was a tambourine; and the dulcimer, a horizontal       harp with wire strings, and struck with a stick like the       psaltery.\"    The following interesting and able summary of the history of ancient  Roman music is taken from a recent number of \"The Vox Humana:\"--         \"Art love was not a distinguished characteristic of the       ancient Romans; and we are not astonished, therefore, to       find them borrowing music from Etruria, Greece, and Egypt;       originating nothing, and (although the study was pursued by       the emperors) never finding any thing higher in its practice       than a sensuous gratification.         \"In the earliest days of Rome, the inhabitants were       exclusively farmers or warriors; and their first temples       were raised to Ceres or to Mars.         \"The priests of Ceres came originally from Asia Minor, and       were called the Arval Brotherhood. Flute-playing was a       prominent feature in their rites, and they were all       proficient upon that instrument. Their number was limited to       twelve.         \"The worship of Mars was conducted by the Salian priests,       whom Numa summoned to Rome from Etruria. These also used the       flute as an accessory to their sacrificial rites. In these       primitive days of Rome, much was borrowed from the Etruscans       in style and instruments of music.         \"The earliest songs of Rome were in praise of Romulus, and       told the story of the twin-brothers and the divine origin of       the city. They were sung by choruses of boys. Similar songs       were sung during meals by the elders, with an accompaniment       of flutes; these latter songs being especially directed to       the young men, and inciting them to be worthy of the deeds       of their ancestors.         \"Under the rule of the emperors, all these worthy       compositions went to decay, and were replaced by a much more       degrading school of music. At no time, however, was music       considered a necessary part of the education of Roman youth.         \"There existed in the latter days of ancient Rome some       music-schools; but the study was far less universally       pursued than in Greece at the same epoch. The musical course       has been given by Quintilian as follows:--         \"Theoretical: first, arithmetic, physics; second, harmony,       rhythm, metrics.         \"Practical: composition, rhythm, melody, poetry.         \"Execution: playing instruments, singing, dramatic action;       which makes a rather formidable array, even to modern eyes.         \"Among the Roman musical instruments, the flute was the most       popular, and essentially national. We have already stated       that it was used in the worship of their two chief deities:       it was in secular use to a yet greater extent.         \"This flute (_tibia_) was hooped with brass bands, and had       an immense resonance. It was used by both sexes; but, on       public and on most religious occasions, was played by men.         \"The frequency with which it was used made the art of       playing it a most remunerative one; and the flute-players       soon formed themselves into a guild, or protective society.       This guild had many privileges accorded to it, and existed       for a period of some centuries. The 'Guild of Dionysian       Artists' was a society of later date, and was a musical       conservatory, academy, and agency, all in one. It flourished       greatly under the patronage of various Roman emperors, and       for a long time supplied singers and actors to the Roman       world.         \"Valerius Maximus has given an anecdote which shows how       powerful and exacting the guild of flute-players could       afford to be.         \"They were one day excluded from the Temple of Jupiter,       where they had been allowed, by ancient custom, to take       their meals; upon which the entire guild left Rome, and went       to the village of Tibur near by. This caused great       embarrassment: no religious services could be held, and       scarce any state ceremony properly conducted. The senate       thereupon sent an embassy to induce them to return,--in       vain: the angry musicians were inflexible. The wily       ambassadors then called the inhabitants of Tibur to their       aid, and these pretended to give a great feast to welcome       the flute-players. At this feast the musicians were all made       very drunk; and, while asleep from the effects of their       liquor, they were bundled into chariots, and driven back to       Rome, where all their old privileges were restored, and       newer and greater ones added.         \"They received the right to give public representations and       spectacles in Rome; but at these they were all masked, the       reason being their shame at the manner of their inglorious       return to the city.         \"Flutes were used at funerals; and it appears, at one time,       the luxury and pomp of Roman obsequies grew so excessive,       that a law was passed limiting the number of flute-players       on such occasions to ten.         \"Only at one time did the flute disappear from any public       worship, and that was when the worship of Bacchus was       introduced into Rome. To this rite the kithara was used; but       this worship, which was somewhat refined, though jovial,       among the Greeks, became among the Romans so debauched and       uxorious, that it was soon prohibited by law.         \"The flute was used in combination with other instruments at       times. Apuleius speaks of a concert of flutes, kitharas, and       chorus, and mentions its deliciously sweet effect. It was       also used as a pitch-pipe, to give orators a guide in       modulating their voices when addressing an assembly: thus       Caius Gracchus always on such occasions had a slave behind       him, whose duty it was to aid him to commence his orations       in a proper pitch, and when his voice sank too low, or       became too shrill, to call him to a better intonation by the       sounds of the flute.         \"Although the flute was the favorite Roman instrument, it       was by no means the only one. Trumpets were used to a great       extent. A one-toned trumpet, of very loud voice, was used       for battle-signals. These were of very large size, usually       of brass; and their sound is described as 'terrible.' There       was also a smaller (shepherd's) trumpet of mellower tone.         \"Another much-used instrument, of different character, was       the _sumphonium_, which did not differ materially from the       modern bagpipe.         \"Instruments of percussion were few, and not indigenous to       the Romans: such as were used came from the East, and were       chiefly used in the worship of Eastern deities at Rome. When       the worship of Bacchus was prohibited, they passed away with       that licentious rite. The most complicated instrument of       the ancient world appeared in Rome during the first century       of our era. It was an _organ_, not, as in the scriptural       days, a mere syrinx, or Pan's pipes, but an undoubted organ,       somewhat similar in effect to our modern instrument.         \"The instrument is said to have been invented by Ctesbius of       Alexandria in Egypt, who lived about 250 B.C. It did not       appear extensively in Rome, however, until nearly three       hundred years later. This organ has given rise to much       fruitless discussion. In the field of musical history       especially, 'a little' knowledge has proved 'a dangerous       thing;' for, where slight descriptions exist of instruments       of music, latitude is left for every writer to form his own       theory, to fight for it, and denunciate those who differ       from it.         \"We have seen what a battle was fought over the three little       manuscripts of Greek music; what a host of differing       opinions were held about the scriptural word 'Selah:' and       now, about this hydraulic organ, each writer mounts his       hobby-horse, and careers over the field of conjecture.       Vitruvius has given a full description of the instrument       from personal inspection; but as his technical terms have       lost all significance to modern readers, and have been       translated in various ways, and as his work contained no       diagrams or illustrations of the various parts, it is       useless.         \"Some writers imagine the organ to have had seven or eight       stops,--that is, so many different _kinds_ of tones,--which       would place them nearly on a par with our own. Others think       that they possessed seven or eight _keys_; that is, so many       _tones_ only. It has been a point of dispute as to what       function the water performed in working it. Vitruvius is       rather hazy on this point, saying only that it is       'suspended' in the instrument. The water, when the organ was       played, was in a state of agitation, as if boiling.         \"There are medals still in existence which were awarded to       victors in organ contests, on which this instrument is       represented with two boys blowing or pumping;"]]]
