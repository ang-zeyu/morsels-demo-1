In the Cross with the short horn, the form ordinarily becomes more  symmetrical, while there is, perhaps, little risk of lessening the  milking qualities of the offspring, if sufficient regard is paid to the  selection of the individual animals to breed from. It is thought by some  that in the breeding of animals it is the male which gives the external  form, or the bony and muscular system of the young, while the female  imparts the respiratory organs, the circulation of the blood, the organs  of secretion, and the like.    If this principle be true, it follows that the milking qualities come  chiefly from the mother, and that the bull cannot materially alter the  conditions which determine the transmission of these qualities,  especially when they are as strongly marked as they are in this breed.    Until, however, certain mooted questions connected with breeding are  definitively settled, it is the safest plan, in breeding for the dairy,  to adhere to the rule of selecting only animals whose progenitors on  both sides have been distinguished for their milking qualities.    It may be stated, in conclusion, that for purely dairy purposes the  Ayrshire cow deserves the first place. In consequence of her small,  symmetrical, and compact body, combined with a well-formed chest and a  capacious stomach, there is little waste, comparatively speaking,  through the respiratory system; while at the same time there is very  complete assimilation of the food, and thus she converts a very large  proportion of her food into milk. So remarkable is this fact, that all  dairy farmers who have any experience on the point, agree in stating  that _an Ayrshire cow generally gives a larger return of milk for the  food consumed than a cow of any other breed_. The absolute quality may  not be so great, but it is obtained at a less cost; and this is the  point upon which the question of profit depends. The best milkers which  have been known in this country were grade Ayrshires, larger in size  than the pure bloods, but still sufficiently high grades to give certain  signs of their origin. This grade would seem to possess the advantage of  combining, to some extent, the two qualities of milking and adaptation  to beef; and this is no small recommendation of the stock to farmers  situated as American farmers are, who wish for milk for some years and  then to turn over to the butcher.      THE JERSEY.    These cattle are now widely known in this country. Many of them have  been imported from an island of the same name in the British Channel,  near the coast of France, and they may now be considered, for all  practical purposes, as fully acclimated. They were first introduced,  upward of thirty years ago, from the channel islands, Alderney,  Guernsey, and Jersey.    This race is supposed to have been originally derived from Normandy, in  the northern part of France. The cows have been long celebrated for the  production of very rich milk and cream, but till within the last  twenty-five or thirty years they were comparatively coarse, ugly, and  ill-shaped. Improvements have been very marked, but the form of the  animal is still far from satisfying the eye.    The head of the pure Jersey is fine and tapering, the cheek small, the  throat clean, the muzzle fine and encircled with a light stripe, the  nostril high and open; the horns smooth, crumpled, but not very thick at  the base, tapering and tipped with black; ears small and thin, deep  orange color inside; eyes full and placid; neck straight and fine; chest  broad and deep; barrel hoofed, broad and deep, well ribbed up; back  straight from the withers to the hip, and from the top of the hip to the  setting of the tail; tail fine, at right angles with the back, and  hanging down to the hocks; skin thin, light color, and mellow, covered  with fine soft hair; fore legs short, straight and fine below the knee,  arm swelling and full above; hind quarters long and well filled; hind  legs short and straight below the hocks, with bones rather fine,  squarely placed, and not too close together; hoofs small; udder full in  size, in line with the belly, extending well up behind; teats of medium  size, squarely placed and wide apart, and milk-veins very prominent. The  color is generally cream, dun, or yellow, with more or less of white,  and the fine head and neck give the cows and heifers a fawn-like  appearance, and make them objects of attraction in the park; but the  hind quarters are often too narrow to work well, particularly to those  who judge animals by the amount of fat which they carry.    It should be borne in mind, however, that a good race of animals is not  always the most beautiful, as that term is generally understood. Beauty  in stock has no invariable standard. In the estimation of some, it  results mainly from fine forms, small bones, and close, compact frames;  while others consider that structure the most perfect, and therefore the  most beautiful, which is best adapted to the use for which it is  destined. With such, beauty is relative. It is not the same in an animal  designed for beef and in one designed for the dairy or for work. The  beauty of a milch cow is the result of her good qualities. Large milkers  are very rarely cows that please the eye of any but a skillful judge.  They are generally poor, since their food goes mainly to the production  of milk, and because they are selected with less regard to form than to  good milking qualities. The prevailing opinion as to the beauty of the  Jersey, is based on the general appearance of the cow when in milk--no  experiments in feeding exclusively for beef having been made public,  and no opportunity to form a correct judgment from actual observation  having been furnished; and it must be confessed that the general  appearance of the breed would amply justify the hasty conclusion.    The bulls are usually very different in character and disposition from  the cows, and are much inclined to become restive and cross at the age  of two or three years, unless their treatment is uniformly gentle and  firm.    The Jersey is to be regarded as a dairy breed, and that almost  exclusively. It would not be sought for large dairies kept for the  supply of milk to cities; for, though the quality would gratify the  customer, the quantity would not satisfy the owner. The place of the  Jersey cow is rather in private establishments, where the supply of  cream and butter is a sufficient object; or, in limited numbers, to add  richness to the milk of large butter dairies. Even one or two good  Jersey cows with a herd of fifteen or twenty, will make a great  difference in the quality of the milk and butter of the whole  establishment; and they would probably be profitable for this, if for no  other object.      THE SHORT HORNS.    No breed of cattle has commanded more universal admiration during the  last half century than the improved short horns, whose origin can be  traced back for nearly a hundred years. According to the best  authorities, the stock which formed the basis of improvement existed  equally in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland, and the adjoining  counties; and the pre-eminence was accorded to Durham, which gave its  name to the race, from the more correct principles of breeding which  seem to have obtained there.    There is a dispute among the most eminent breeders as to how far it owes  its origin to early importations from Holland, whence many superior  animals were brought for the purpose of improving the old long horned  breed. A large race of cattle had existed for many years on the western  shores of the continent of Europe. As early as 1633, they were imported  from Denmark into New England in considerable numbers, and thus laid the  foundation of a valuable stock in farming at a very early date in  Holland, and experience led to the greatest care in the choice and  breeding of dairy stock. From these cattle many selections were made to  cross over to the counties of York and Durham. The prevailing color of  the large Dutch cattle was black and white, beautifully contrasted.    [Illustration: A SHORT HORN BULL.]    The cattle produced by these crosses a century ago were known by the  name of \"Dutch.\" The cows selected for crossing with the early imported  Dutch bulls were generally long horned, large boned, coarse animals, a  fair type of which was found in the old \"Holderness\" breed of  Yorkshire--slow feeders, strong in the shoulder, defective in the fore  quarter, and not very profitable to the butcher, their meat being coarse  and uninviting. Their milking qualities were good, surpassing those,  probably, of the improved short horns. Whatever may be the truth with  regard to these crosses, and however far they proved effective in  creating or laying the foundation of the modern improved short horns,  the results of the efforts made in Yorkshire and some of the adjoining  counties were never so satisfactory to the best judges as those of the  breeders along the Tees, who selected animals with greater reference to  fineness of bone and symmetry of form, and the animals they bred soon  took the lead and excited great emulation in improvement.    Importations of short horns have been frequent and extensive into the  United States within the last few years, and this famous breed is now  pretty generally diffused over the country.    The high-bred short horn is easily prepared for a show, and, as fat will  cover faults, the temptation is often too great to be resisted; and  hence it is not uncommon to see the finest animals rendered unfit for  breeding purposes by over-feeding. The race is susceptible of breeding  for the production of milk, as several families show, and great milkers  have often been known among pure-bred animals; but it is more common to  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22775"],[0,"Psychotherapy (#5)"],[1,"vividness of all  the other points and numberless mental relations of space perception  among the various parts of the table. In the thorough analysis of the  describing psychologist, every single idea, and in the same way, every  single emotion or feeling or judgment becomes complex like a living  organism, an aggregate of thousands of mental tissues, and yet made up  from \"the stuff that dreams are made of.\"    But there is one particular difficulty which makes the psychological  description so much harder than that of the physicist, and which gives  rise to many disagreements and discussions in psychological literature.  The psychologist has not only to tear the complex into pieces and thus  to seek the elements, but he has to fixate those elements for the  purpose of communication, as, of course, a scientific description  demands that he be able to give account to others of what he  experiences. The physicist has no difficulty whatever in that line  because, as we saw, the world of physical things is the world which all  men are sharing together. Every element which I find in it, I can show  to every other person, and if I cannot show that particular thing,  because I cannot yet carry the mountain to another place, then I can at  least measure it, as we share those standards of space. Thus natural  science has in its objective measurements the possibility of describing  every part of the physical world. The psychical world, on the other  hand, is as we saw, the world which is private property. Every effort at  description is thus entirely in vain as long as our mental facts cannot  somehow be linked with physical happenings. If I say that I have in my  mind sweetness or sourness, or bitterness or saltness, I cannot carry  any understanding to anyone else and therefore cannot give any  description until I have agreed that I mean by sweetness the sensation  which sugar gives me, and by saltness the sensation of salt. The sugar  and salt I can point out to my neighbor and only in that way I  understand what he means if he says that he tastes salt and sweet;  otherwise I should have no means whatever to discriminate whether that  which he calls a sweet taste sensation is not just what I call headache.  Where no such direct relation for a physical thing is known, description  of the mental element would remain impossible. Of course, every  perception of the outer world, all our seeing and hearing, and touching  and tasting, offers us at once such definite connection between the  inner experience and a piece of the physical universe. Our own organism  is also such a piece of physical nature: just as I describe my tasting  or touching, I may describe the perception of my arms and legs or my  inner organs. Thus everything which is material of perception gives us a  handle for a real psychological description. Psychology usually calls  the elements of these perceptions sensations. Whatever is composed of  sensations is thus describable.    On the other hand, no other way of description is open. If there were  mental states which are composed of other elements than sensations, they  would necessarily remain indescribable; we could not grasp them because  they would not have any definite relation to the common physical world.  We might say, for instance, that our mental content is made up of  sensations and feelings, but if such feelings were really entirely  different from sensations, they would have to remain for all time  mysterious and unknown. We could not compare notes. The feeling which I  call joy may feel just like the one which you call despair. The  consistent development of modern psychology and its emancipation from  vagueness and superficial analysis became possible only through the fact  that such recourse to indescribable elements has become unnecessary.  Modern psychology has been able to demonstrate more and more that the  same elements which constitute our perceptions are also the elements of  the other contents of consciousness. In other words modern psychology  has recognized that the volitions and emotions and feelings and  judgments, and the whole stream of inner life, are made up of  sensations. Millions of sensations in all degrees of vividness and  clearness, of intensity and fusion, in endless manifoldness of rhythms  and relations constitute their whole content. It is a discovery quite  similar to the one which chemistry made when it found that the same  elements which are part of the inorganic substances are also the only  possible elements of the organic world.    From a strictly psychological standpoint, the ideas and the not-ideas  contain thus nothing but sensations. Their grouping, their shading,  their combination, their succession decide whether we have before us a  perception or an imagination, a volition or an emotion. What are we  ourselves then for the psychologist? Evidently we ourselves belong also  to the inner experiences which we know; and psychology has succeeded in  analyzing this idea of our own self just in the same way as it analyzes  our idea of the moon. In this analysis, psychology finds its idea of the  self as a content of consciousness crystallized about the sensations  from the body. Every one of our bodily activities is represented in our  consciousness by movement sensations, and these sensations form the core  of the complex aggregate which develops into the idea of ourselves.  Organic sensations from our inner organs, pain sensations and pleasure  sensations fuse with the movement sensations, and the whole complex  shapes itself slowly into the idea of the personality of the self in  contrast to the idea of other personalities. We ourselves are for  ourselves a complex combination of sensations; and yet all our feelings  and emotions and volitions are only a part of it. Psychology thus  necessarily considers those experiences of feeling and will and  character simply as changes in the midst of that central experience of  personality which is itself made up of bodily sensations. Each bit of  will and emotion must be decomposed into its finest elements. There is  no passing mood, and no floating half-thought in our mind, no dream and  no intuition, no slightest change of attention, no instinct and desire  which cannot be analyzed thus into its sensation elements or rather  which must not be analyzed, if we are to describe it at all, and that  means if we are to give a psychological account. Psychology is endlessly  far from this ideal to-day. It has been claimed, not without justice,  that psychology has reached to-day only the level which physics attained  in the seventeenth century; but psychology must insist that its ideal  lies in this direction. No one takes a real psychological view of the  human mind who does not understand this endless complexity of the  material, and who does not see that even the simplest mental state  practically presents a most complex problem to scientific analysis. The  physician who really aims towards scientifically exact influence on the  human mind has reached the first step of his preparation as soon as he  understands that the content of consciousness is composed of hundreds  of thousands of elements. To treat the mind as if there were only a few  large pieces, one thing called memory and one thing called will and one  called emotion and so on, is as if a surgeon were to perform an  operation, knowing that there are arms and legs, but not knowing the  ramifications of the nerves and blood-vessels which his knife may  injure. Yet the description of these complex facts is only the beginning  of psychology. We saw that the real aim is their explanation.          III    MIND AND BRAIN      The central aim of the psychologist must be to explain the mental facts.  It is not sufficient to describe the procession of mental experiences in  us, we must understand the causes which determine that now this and now  that appears and disappears, and appears just in this combination of  elements. The astronomer is not satisfied with describing the stars, he  wants to explain their movements and to determine which movements are to  be expected. The psychologist, like the naturalist, aims towards  explanation, and it is this demand which forces him to look from the  psychical facts to the physical ones, from the mind to the brain. He is  under an illusion if he fancies that he can explain mental facts by  themselves. The purposive mind has its connection in itself, the causal  psychological mind demands for its connection the body. To understand  this necessity is the first step towards understanding the relation of  mind and brain.    The psychologist's problem of explanation is in one way entirely  different from that of the physicist. The physicist finds a world of an  unlimited number of atoms which are ultimately conceived as all alike,  but each one in a different place, and all the changes in the universe,  the movements of the stars, the waves of the ocean, are to be explained  by the causal connections of the movements of these atoms. The  psychologist, on the other hand, finds an endless manifoldness of  elements which are not in space, and which have no space form whatever.  My will is neither triangular nor oval; my emotion is neither shorter  than five feet nor longer; my memory image of a melody has no thickness  and no tallness; my contents of consciousness are as such not in space;  their elements cannot pass through any space movements like the atoms of  the physicist. Instead of it, the psychical atoms, the sensations, have  different qualities, are blue and green, and cold and warm, and sweet  and sour, and toothache and headache. The changes which go on in such a  system are thus not changes of position and movements, but changes in  kind and strength and vividness and fusion; and exactly such changes are  the processes which the psychologist wants to explain. He wants to make  us understand why this idea grows up"]]]
