But it  is more civilised, for, as M. Tarde ingeniously contends, the bent of  civilisation at present is to travel northward. Admitting for a moment  that Scotland is more civilised than Spain or Italy, all savage  tribes, on the other hand, are confessedly less advanced in the arts  of life than these two peninsulas. But, for all that, many of these  savage peoples are much less criminal. \"I have lived,\" says Mr.  Russell Wallace, \"with communities of savages in South America and in  the East who have no laws or law courts, but the public opinion of the  village freely expressed. Each man scrupulously respects the rights of  his fellows, and any infraction of these rights rarely or never takes  place.\" Mr. Herbert Spencer also quotes innumerable instances of the  kindness, mildness, honesty, and respect for person and property of  uncivilised peoples. M. de Quatrefages, in summing up the ethical  characteristics of the various races of mankind, comes to the  conclusion that from a moral point of view the white man is hardly any  better than the black. Civilisation so far has unfortunately generated  almost as many vices as it has virtues, and he is a bold man who will  say that its growth has diminished the amount of crime. It is very  difficult then to accept the view that the frequency of murder in  Spain and Italy is entirely due to a lack of civilisation.    Nor can it be said to be entirely due to economic distress. A  condition of social misery has undoubtedly something to do with the  production of crime. In countries where there is much wealth side by  side with much misery, as in France and England, adverse social  circumstances drive a certain portion of the community into criminal  courses. But where this great inequality of social conditions does not  exist--where all are poor as in Ireland or Italy--poverty alone is not  a weighty factor in ordinary crime. In Ireland, for example, there in  almost as much poverty as exists in Italy, and if the amount of crime  were determined by economic circumstances alone, Ireland ought to have  as black a record as her southern sister. Instead of that she is on  the whole as free from crime as the most prosperous countries of  Europe. In the face of these facts it is impossible to say that the  high rate of crime in Italy and Spain is to be wholly accounted for by  the pressure of economic adversity.    Will not difference of race suffice to account for it? Is it not the  case that some races are inherently more prone to crime than others?  In India, for instance, where the great mass of the population is  singularly law-abiding, a portion of the aboriginal inhabitants have  from time immemorial lived by plunder and crime. \"When a man tells  you,\" says an official report, quoted by Sir John Strachey, \"that he  is a Badhak, or a Kanjar, or a Sonoria, he tells you what few  Europeans ever thoroughly realise, that he, an offender against the  law, has been so from the beginning and will be so to the end; that  reform is impossible, for it is his trade, his caste--I may almost say  his religion--to commit crime.\" It is not poverty which makes many of  these predatory races criminals. Speaking of the Mina tribe inhabiting  one of the frontier districts of the Punjab, Sir John Strachey says:  \"Their sole occupation is, and always has been, plunder in the native  States and in distant parts of British India; they give no trouble at  home, and, judging from criminal statistics, it would be supposed that  they were an honest community. They live amid abundance, in  substantial houses with numerous cattle, fine clothes and jewels, and  fleet camels to carry off their plunder.\" Special laws have been made  for dealing with these tribes; a register of their numbers is kept;  they can be compelled to live within certain local limits, but in  spite of these coercive measures crime is not suppressed, and \"a long  time must elapse before we see the end of the criminal tribes of  India.\"    Coming back to European peoples, it is worthy of note that both  Hungary and Finland are inhabited by the same race. These two  countries are separated by about fifteen degrees of latitude, but in  the matter of murder the people of Finland are much more nearly allied  to the Hungarians than to their immediate neighbours, the Swedes and  Norwegians. The Finns commit about twice as many murders in proportion  to the population as the Teutons of Scandinavia, but only about half  as many as the Hungarians; and it is not improbable to suppose that  while the effect of race makes them more murderous than the  Scandinavians, the effect of climate makes them less murderous than  the inhabitants of Hungary.    Before bringing forward any additional material on one side or the  other, let us pause for a moment to consider the results which have  just been obtained as to the effect of race as compared with climate  upon crime. In India we have found an Aryan and a non-Aryan population  living together under the same climatic influences, and very much the  same social conditions, and we have seen that the Aborigines are more  criminally disposed than the Aryan invaders. Again we have a Mongolian  race living in the far North of Europe, and we find that they show a  larger percentage of homicidal crime than the Teutonic inhabitants  who live in the same latitudes. In Hungary, where the Mongoloid type  is once more met with, the same facts are substantially reproduced;  this type is more homicidal than the Austrian Teutons living under a  similar climate. While these facts point to the conclusion that race  has apparently some influence on the amount of crime, they fail to  show that race characteristics alone are sufficient to explain the  differences in criminality between the same peoples when settled in  different quarters of the globe. The Mongoloid type in Finland is  less criminal than the same type in Hungary, and the Teutonic type  in Scandinavia is less murderously disposed than the same type in  the empire of Austria. It has also been pointed out that the  Anglo-American of the Northern States is more law abiding than his  brother by race in the South, while both are more murderous than the  inhabitants of the United Kingdom; where extremes of climate are not  so great.    With these facts before us we shall now institute another comparison  between two widely separated branches of the Anglo-Saxon race, namely,  the colonists of Australia and the people of the motherland. Of the  Australian colonists it is not incorrect to say that they are, on the  whole, the pick of the home population. It is perfectly true that a  certain proportion of the ne'er-do-wells have emigrated to Australia,  and some of them, no doubt, help to swell the normal criminal  population of the colonies. But, on the other hand, Australia has this  advantage, that the average colonist who seeks a home beyond our  shores is generally a superior man to the average citizen who remains  at home; he is more steady, more enterprising, more industrious. In  this way the balance is adjusted in favour of the colonies. It is a  great deal more than redressed if the superior, social, and economic  conditions, under which the colonists live, are also placed in the  scale. In his \"Problems of Greater Britain,\" Sir Charles Dilke has  shown, with admirable clearness, what immense advantages are enjoyed  by the working population of Australia as compared with the same class  at home; so much is this the case that the Australian colonies have  been not inaptly called the paradise of the working man. Here then is  an excellent opportunity for comparing the effects of climate upon  crime. In Australia we have a people of the same race as ourselves,  better off economically, living under essentially the same laws and  governed in practically the same spirit. Almost the only difference  between the inhabitants of the United Kingdom and the communities of  Australia is a difference of climate. Does this difference manifest  itself in the statistics of crime? In order to test the matter we  shall exclude the colony of New South Wales from our calculations. For  its size New South Wales is the richest community in the world, and  its riches are well distributed among all classes of the population.  But it was at one time a penal settlement, and it is possible that the  criminal statistics of the colony are still inflated by that remote  cause. The sister colony of Victoria stands upon a different footing  and is free from that disturbing factor; we shall therefore select  that colony as a normal type of the Australian group. In Part V.I.I.  of the Statistical Register of the colony of Victoria for 1887, there  is an excellent summary of the position of the colony with respect to  crime. The admirable manner in which these judicial statistics are  arranged, reflects the highest credit on the colonial authorities; for  fulness of information and clearness of arrangement they are not  surpassed by any similar statistics in the world. As homicide is the  crime on which we have hitherto based our international comparisons,  we shall, for the present, confine our attention to the Victorian  statistics of this offence.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Countries|Population|Years.|       Tried        |   Convicted             | over Ten.|      | Annual     Per     | Annual     Per             |          |      |Average 100,000     |Average   100,000             |          |      |        Inhabitants.|        Inhabitants.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Victoria |   581,838|1882-6|   22       3.2     |   14       2.5    United    Kingdom  |26,594,582|1882-6|  505       2.35    |  226       .96  ---------------------------------------"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15831"],[0,"The Scientific American Boy; Or, The Camp at Willow Clump Island (#7)"],[1,"flush with the deck boards, which were later applied. Six thole pins,  1/2 inch thick, 4-1/2 inches long and 2 inches wide, were cut out of an  oak board. The lower end of each pin was reduced to a width of 1-1/2  inches for a length of 2 inches. The thole pins were then fitted snugly  in the notches. Two cleats, nailed to the side boards inside, 7 inches  below the upper edge, served to support a seat board 1 inch thick and 2  feet 10-1/2 inches long. The aft edge of the seat was about 10 inches  forward of the rowlocks. The boat was completed by nailing on a couple  of deck boards at each end. The oars were made of 2-inch pine boards, 5  feet long and 5 inches wide. They were blocked out at Mr. Schreiner's  sawmill and then shaped and smoothed down with a draw-knife and  spoke-shaved. They were 1-1/4 inches at the handle and 2 inches  immediately below, tapering down to a diameter of 1-1/4 inches at the  top of the blade. The blades were 18 inches long, 5 inches wide, and  planed down to a thickness of 1/4 inch along the edges.          CHAPTER VI.    OFF TO THE ISLAND.      The morning of July 2d dawned bright and clear, but long before daybreak  the members of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I. were astir. The jolly red  sun peeping over the eastern hills witnessed an unaccustomed sight. Six  greatly excited boys were running back and forth from the barn to the  canal, bearing all manner of mysterious bundles, which were carefully  deposited in a freshly painted scow. Yes, all six of us were there.      A UNIQUE ALARM CLOCK.    We hadn't expected to see Reddy Schreiner at such an early hour, for he  was always a sleepyhead, and no alarm clock would ever wake him. But  this was an exceptional day, and, besides, Reddy was quite an original  chap. He had taken one of the borrowed roosters into his room the night  before, and when, early in the morning, Mr. Chanticleer had mounted the  footboard of the bed, flapped his wings and given vent to his opinion of  a boy who persisted in sleeping at that late hour of the day, the noise  was too much for even Reddy's drowsy sensibilities.    [Illustration: Fig. 65. Off to the Island.]      THE TRIP TO THE ISLAND.    [Illustration: The Ledge below the Goblins' Platform.]    [Illustration: The Camp at Willow Clump Island.]    Our scow was not large enough to carry all the things we had to take  with us, but as Mr. Schreiner was going to take Uncle Ed up in his  wagon, we left the rest of our luggage for him to bring along. We boys  walked the eleven miles up the canal to Lumberville, towing the barge.  It was a tiresome task; but we divided the work into two-mile shifts,  two boys towing at a time and then each taking a mile ride as steersman  in the boat. It was about noon when we arrived at Lumberville, and then  we had to unload our boat before we could haul it out of the canal and  down to the river. The river on the Jersey side of the island was so  shallow that we waded across, pushing the boat ahead of us. The current  was too swift to permit of rowing, and it was rather hard for us to keep  our footing. But we managed to reach our destination finally without any  mishap. The island was thickly wooded, except for a small clearing where  we landed. The first thing we did was to unpack our eatables, and Jack,  the cook, soon had an appetizing pan of bacon and eggs sputtering on the  kerosene stove.    [Illustration: Fig. 66. Dragging the Scow over to the Island.]      PRELIMINARY EXPLORATION.    As no better position offered at the time we pitched our tent in the  clearing, pending a thorough search for a more suitable place elsewhere.  Around the tent we dug a trench about a foot deep to prevent water from  entering our quarters when it rained. It was about time for Uncle Ed and  Mr. Schreiner to appear with the rest of our luggage, so we did not have  time to do much exploring, but sauntered southward along the shore,  always on the lookout for their arrival. About a quarter of a mile from  the tent we came across the wreck of an old bridge, which had been  washed down by some freshet. This was a great find, and served us many  purposes, as will appear later.    While we were examining the wreck we heard a distant \"halloa\" from the  mainland. There was Uncle Ed sitting on a pile of goods on the railroad  bank looking for all the world like an Italian immigrant. We answered  with a shout and scrambled back to the clearing. Then we ran splashing  through the water, pushing the boat before us. It didn't take us long to  load up and carry him back to the island.      A RUSTIC TABLE.    [Illustration: Fig. 67. The Rustic Table.]    Uncle Ed entered into our fun at once. He was as enthusiastic as a boy  over the surroundings, and when we told him of the old bridge he started  right off to investigate, taking the ax with him. Soon he had pried off  a number of the planks, which we used for a flooring to our tent. Then  he built us a table out of four forked sticks, driven into the ground,  and supporting two cross sticks, on which a pair of planks were laid.      THE SMALL FILTER.    \"Well, now, boys,\" said Uncle Ed, wiping the perspiration from his  forehead, \"I am as thirsty as a whale. Where do you get your drinking  water? Is there a spring on the island?\"    We told him that we used the river water.    [Illustration: Fig. 68. The Small Filter.]    \"What, river water! That won't do at all,\" he cried. \"You'll all have  the typhoid fever. We must build a filter. I brought some charcoal with  me for this very purpose.\"    Taking one of our pails he broke a hole in the bottom of it and stuffed  a sponge in the hole. A layer of small stones was then placed in the  pail, over this a layer of broken charcoal with the dust carefully blown  out, then a layer of clean sand, and finally a layer of gravel. Each  layer was about two inches thick. The pail was suspended from a branch  in a cool place and proved an excellent filter, the water trickling out  through the sponge being perfectly pure and sweet, no matter how dirty  it had been when poured in; but the capacity of the filter was too  small, and Uncle Ed said he would make us a larger one on the morrow if  no spring was discovered in the meantime.    The sun was getting low in the west, and we therefore postponed the  exploration of our island until the following day. We had been up since  four o'clock that morning and had done some pretty hard work; so,  immediately after supper, we turned in and, lulled by the murmuring of  the river, were soon fast asleep.      THE BARREL FILTER.    [Illustration: Fig. 69. The Barrel Filter.]    Immediately after breakfast the next day we started out in two parties  to search the island. The only discovery of any moment was that made by  Dutchy's party, which found a small island separated from ours by a  narrow channel, through which the water ran like a mill-race. No spring  was discovered, so Uncle Ed had to construct his large filter. Bill and  I went over to Lumberville in search of a couple of cider barrels and a  pailful of charcoal. The barrels were placed one on top of the other  after cutting a large hole in the top of the lower barrel, and a smaller  one in the bottom of the upper one. The latter opening was covered by an  inverted saucer. Over this we spread a 3-inch layer of coarse sand, then  a 2-inch layer of charcoal, a 4-inch layer of clear, sharp sand, and a  2-inch top layer of gravel. The lower barrel was provided with a faucet,  through which we could draw off the filtered water as desired. In order  to keep the water cool we placed the filters in a shady place near the  river, and piled up earth around the lower barrel.    \"Now, boys,\" said Uncle Ed, \"form in line there, and we will go through  a fire drill.\"    He arranged us about five feet apart in a line extending from the filter  to the river. We had six pails, and these Dutchy filled one at a time,  passing them up the line to Reddy, who emptied them into the upper  barrel and then threw them back to Dutchy to be refilled. Working in  this way it did not take long to fill up the filter, and the burden of  keeping the barrels full, instead of falling on one person, was shared  alike by all.    [Illustration: Fig. 70. Filling the Barrel.]      THE KLEPALO.    Our camp outfit was further augmented by a dinner call. We discovered  the necessity of such a call on our very first day of camping. Dutchy  was so excited by his discoveries of the morning that he started out  alone in the afternoon to make a further search. The rest of us were  lazy after the noon meal, and were lolling around taking it easy during  the heat of the day, and discussing plans for the future. But Dutchy's  energetic nature would not permit him to keep quiet. He took the scow  and waded with it against the strong current to the deeper and quieter  water above the island. Then he rowed a long way up stream. He was gone  all the afternoon. Supper time came and still he didn't appear. The sun  was high, and I presume he didn't realize how late it was getting.  Finally, just at sunset, he came drifting down with the current, tired  and hungry, and ready for a large meal. But we had finished our supper  an hour before, and poor Dutchy had to be content with a few cold  remnants, because the cook had declared he wouldn't prepare an extra  meal for a fellow who didn't have sense enough to know when it was meal  time.    Then it was that Uncle Ed bethought himself of the _klepalo_.    \"You ought to have some sort of a dinner call,\" he declared, \"so that  any one within a mile of camp will know when dinner is ready.\"    [Illustration: The _Klepalo_.]    \"Did you ever hear of a _klepalo_? No? Well, I was down in  Macedonia a couple of years ago inspecting a railroad, and I stopped off  for the night at a small Bulgarian village.
