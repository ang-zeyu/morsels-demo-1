You are still unconvinced?\"    \"I am at least deeply interested.\"    \"Then your case is not hopeless.  I feel that there is reason lurking  in you somewhere, so we will patiently grope round for it.  We will now  leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative.  You can imagine  that I could hardly come away from the Amazon without probing deeper  into the matter.  There were indications as to the direction from which  the dead traveler had come.  Indian legends would alone have been my  guide, for I found that rumors of a strange land were common among all  the riverine tribes.  You have heard, no doubt, of Curupuri?\"    \"Never.\"    \"Curupuri is the spirit of the woods, something terrible, something  malevolent, something to be avoided.  None can describe its shape or  nature, but it is a word of terror along the Amazon.  Now all tribes  agree as to the direction in which Curupuri lives.  It was the same  direction from which the American had come.  Something terrible lay  that way.  It was my business to find out what it was.\"    \"What did you do?\"  My flippancy was all gone.  This massive man  compelled one's attention and respect.    \"I overcame the extreme reluctance of the natives--a reluctance which  extends even to talk upon the subject--and by judicious persuasion and  gifts, aided, I will admit, by some threats of coercion, I got two of  them to act as guides.  After many adventures which I need not  describe, and after traveling a distance which I will not mention, in a  direction which I withhold, we came at last to a tract of country which  has never been described, nor, indeed, visited save by my unfortunate  predecessor.  Would you kindly look at this?\"    He handed me a photograph--half-plate size.    \"The unsatisfactory appearance of it is due to the fact,\" said he,  \"that on descending the river the boat was upset and the case which  contained the undeveloped films was broken, with disastrous results.  Nearly all of them were totally ruined--an irreparable loss.  This is  one of the few which partially escaped.  This explanation of  deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept.  There was talk  of faking.  I am not in a mood to argue such a point.\"    The photograph was certainly very off-colored.  An unkind critic might  easily have misinterpreted that dim surface.  It was a dull gray  landscape, and as I gradually deciphered the details of it I realized  that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly  like an immense cataract seen in the distance, with a sloping,  tree-clad plain in the foreground.    \"I believe it is the same place as the painted picture,\" said I.    \"It is the same place,\" the Professor answered.  \"I found traces of the  fellow's camp.  Now look at this.\"    It was a nearer view of the same scene, though the photograph was  extremely defective.  I could distinctly see the isolated, tree-crowned  pinnacle of rock which was detached from the crag.    \"I have no doubt of it at all,\" said I.    \"Well, that is something gained,\" said he.  \"We progress, do we not?  Now, will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle?  Do you  observe something there?\"    \"An enormous tree.\"    \"But on the tree?\"    \"A large bird,\" said I.    He handed me a lens.    \"Yes,\" I said, peering through it, \"a large bird stands on the tree.  It appears to have a considerable beak.  I should say it was a pelican.\"    \"I cannot congratulate you upon your eyesight,\" said the Professor.  \"It is not a pelican, nor, indeed, is it a bird.  It may interest you  to know that I succeeded in shooting that particular specimen.  It was  the only absolute proof of my experiences which I was able to bring  away with me.\"    \"You have it, then?\"  Here at last was tangible corroboration.    \"I had it.  It was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same  boat accident which ruined my photographs.  I clutched at it as it  disappeared in the swirl of the rapids, and part of its wing was left  in my hand.  I was insensible when washed ashore, but the miserable  remnant of my superb specimen was still intact; I now lay it before  you.\"    From a drawer he produced what seemed to me to be the upper portion of  the wing of a large bat.  It was at least two feet in length, a curved  bone, with a membranous veil beneath it.    \"A monstrous bat!\" I suggested.    \"Nothing of the sort,\" said the Professor, severely.  \"Living, as I do,  in an educated and scientific atmosphere, I could not have conceived  that the first principles of zoology were so little known.  Is it  possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative  anatomy, that the wing of a bird is really the forearm, while the wing  of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between?  Now, in this case, the bone is certainly not the forearm, and you can  see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single  bone, and therefore that it cannot belong to a bat.  But if it is  neither bird nor bat, what is it?\"    My small stock of knowledge was exhausted.    \"I really do not know,\" said I.    He opened the standard work to which he had already referred me.    \"Here,\" said he, pointing to the picture of an extraordinary flying  monster, \"is an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon, or  pterodactyl, a flying reptile of the Jurassic period.  On the next page  is a diagram of the mechanism of its wing.  Kindly compare it with the  specimen in your hand.\"    A wave of amazement passed over me as I looked.  I was convinced.  There could be no getting away from it.  The cumulative proof was  overwhelming.  The sketch, the photographs, the narrative, and now the  actual specimen--the evidence was complete.  I said so--I said so  warmly, for I felt that the Professor was an ill-used man.  He leaned  back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile, basking  in this sudden gleam of sunshine.    \"It's just the very biggest thing that I ever heard of!\" said I, though  it was my journalistic rather than my scientific enthusiasm that was  roused.  \"It is colossal.  You are a Columbus of science who has  discovered a lost world.  I'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you.  It was all so unthinkable.  But I understand evidence when I see it,  and this should be good enough for anyone.\"    The Professor purred with satisfaction.    \"And then, sir, what did you do next?\"    \"It was the wet season, Mr. Malone, and my stores were exhausted.  I  explored some portion of this huge cliff, but I was unable to find any  way to scale it.  The pyramidal rock upon which I saw and shot the  pterodactyl was more accessible.  Being something of a cragsman, I did  manage to get half way to the top of that.  From that height I had a  better idea of the plateau upon the top of the crags.  It appeared to  be very large; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the  vista of green-capped cliffs.  Below, it is a swampy, jungly region,  full of snakes, insects, and fever.  It is a natural protection to this  singular country.\"    \"Did you see any other trace of life?\"    \"No, sir, I did not; but during the week that we lay encamped at the  base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above.\"    \"But the creature that the American drew?  How do you account for that?\"    \"We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and  seen it there.  We know, therefore, that there is a way up.  We know  equally that it must be a very difficult one, otherwise the creatures  would have come down and overrun the surrounding country.  Surely that  is clear?\"    \"But how did they come to be there?\"    \"I do not think that the problem is a very obscure one,\" said the  Professor; \"there can only be one explanation.  South America is, as  you may have heard, a granite continent.  At this single point in the  interior there has been, in some far distant age, a great, sudden  volcanic upheaval.  These cliffs, I may remark, are basaltic, and  therefore plutonic.  An area, as large perhaps as Sussex, has been  lifted up en bloc with all its living contents, and cut off by  perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from all  the rest of the continent.  What is the result?  Why, the ordinary laws  of Nature are suspended.  The various checks which influence the  struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or  altered.  Creatures survive which would otherwise disappear.  You will  observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are Jurassic, and  therefore of a great age in the order of life.  They have been  artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions.\"    \"But surely your evidence is conclusive.  You have only to lay it  before the proper authorities.\"    \"So in my simplicity, I had imagined,\" said the Professor, bitterly.  \"I can only tell you that it was not so, that I was met at every turn  by incredulity, born partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy.  It is  not my nature, sir, to cringe to any man, or to seek to prove a fact if  my word has been doubted.  After the first I have not condescended to  show such corroborative proofs as I possess.  The subject became  hateful to me--I would not speak of it.  When men like yourself, who  represent the foolish curiosity of the public, came to disturb my  privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve.  By nature I  am, I admit, somewhat fiery, and under provocation I am inclined to be  violent.  I fear you may have remarked it.\"    I nursed my eye and was silent.    \"My wife has frequently remonstrated with me upon the subject, and yet  I fancy that any man of honor would feel the same.  To-night, however,  I propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over  the emotions.

Then he stood up in the  sleigh among his blankets. \"H'm,\" said he, \"the kid.\"    \"Throw up your hands! Quit fooling with that blanket!\" Drake spoke  dangerously now. \"Bolles,\" he continued, \"pitch everything out of the  sleigh while I cover him. He's got a shot-gun under that blanket. Sling  it out.\"    It was slung. The wraps followed. Uncle Pasco stepped obediently down,  and soon the chattels of the emptied sleigh littered the snow. The old  gentleman was invited to undress until they reached the six-shooter that  Drake suspected. Then they ate his lunch, drank some whiskey that he had  not sold to the buccaroos, told him to repack the sleigh, allowed him  to wrap up again, bade him take the reins, and they would use his  six-shooter and shot-gun to point out the road to him.    He had said very little, had Uncle Pasco, but stood blinking, obedient  and malignant. \"H'm,\" said he now, \"goin' to ride with me, are you?\"    He was told yes, that for the present he was their coachman. Their  horses were tired and would follow, tied behind. \"We're weary, too,\"  said Drake, getting in. \"Take your legs out of my way or I'll kick off  your shins. Bolles, are you fixed warm and comfortable? Now start her up  for Harper ranch, Uncle.\"    \"What are you proposing to do with me?\" inquired Uncle Pasco.    \"Not going to wring your neck, and that's enough for the present.  Faster, Uncle. Get a gait on. Bolles, here's Baby Bunting. Much obliged  to you for the loan of it, old man.\"    Uncle Pasco's eye fell on the 22-caliber pistol. \"Did you hold me up  with that lemonade straw?\" he asked, huskily.    \"Yep,\" said Drake. \"That's what.\"    \"Oh, hell!\" murmured Uncle Pasco. And for the first time he seemed  dispirited.    \"Uncle, you're not making time,\" said Drake after a few miles. \"I'll  thank you for the reins. Open your bandanna and get your concertina.  Jerk the bellows for us.\"    \"That I'll not!\" screamed Uncle Pasco.    \"It's music or walk home,\" said the boy. \"Take your choice.\"    Uncle Pasco took his choice, opening with the melody of \"The Last Rose  of Summer.\" The sleigh whirled up the Owyhee by the winter willows, and  the levels, and the meadow pools, bright frozen under the blue sky.  Late in this day the amazed Brock by his corrals at Harper's beheld  arrive his favorite, his boy superintendent, driving in with the  schoolmaster staring through his glasses, and Uncle Pasco throwing  out active strains upon his concertina. The old man had been bidden to  bellows away for his neck.    Drake was not long in explaining his need to the men. \"This thing must  be worked quick,\" said he. \"Who'll stand by me?\"    All of them would, and he took ten, with the faithful Brock. Brock would  not allow Gilbert to go, because he had received another mule-kick in  the stomach. Nor was Bolles permitted to be of the expedition. To all  his protests, Drake had but the single word: \"This is not your fight,  old man. You've done your share with Baby Bunting.\"    Thus was the school-master in sorrow compelled to see them start back  to Indian Creek and the Malheur without him. With him Uncle Pasco would  have joyfully exchanged. He was taken along with the avengers. They  would not wring his neck, but they would play cat and mouse with him and  his concertina; and they did. But the conscience of Bolles still toiled.  When Drake and the men were safe away, he got on the wagon going for the  mail, thus making his way next morning to the railroad and Boise, where  Max Vogel listened to him; and together this couple hastily took train  and team for the Malheur Agency.    The avengers reached Indian Creek duly, and the fourth day after his  Christmas dinner Drake came once more in sight of Castle Rock.    \"I am doing this thing myself, understand,\" he said to Brock. \"I am  responsible.\"    \"We're here to take your orders,\" returned the foreman. But as the  agency buildings grew plain and the time for action was coming, Brock's  anxious heart spoke out of its fulness. \"If they start in to--to--they  might--I wish you'd let me get in front,\" he begged, all at once.    \"I thought you thought better of me,\" said Drake.    \"Excuse me,\" said the man. Then presently: \"I don't see how anybody  could 'a' told he'd smuggle whiskey that way. If the old man [Brock  meant Max Vogel] goes to blame you, I'll give him my opinion straight.\"    \"The old man's got no use for opinions,\" said Drake. \"He goes on  results. He trusted me with this job, and we're going to have results  now.\"    The drunkards were sitting round outside the ranch house. It was  evening. They cast a sullen inspection on the new-comers, who returned  them no inspection whatever. Drake had his men together and took them  to the stable first, a shed with mangers. Here he had them unsaddle.  \"Because,\" he mentioned to Brock, \"in case of trouble we'll be sure of  their all staying. I'm taking no chances now.\"    Soon the drunkards strolled over, saying good-day, hazarding a few  comments on the weather and like topics, and meeting sufficient answers.    \"Goin' to stay?\"    \"Don't know.\"    \"That's a good horse you've got.\"    \"Fair.\"    But Sam was the blithest spirit at the Malheur Agency. \"Hiyah!\" he  exclaimed. \"Misser Dlake! How fashion you come quick so?\" And the  excellent Chinaman took pride in the meal of welcome that he prepared.    \"Supper's now,\" said Drake to his men. \"Sit anywhere you feel like.  Don't mind whose chair you're taking--and we'll keep our guns on.\"    Thus they followed him, and sat. The boy took his customary perch at the  head of the table, with Brock at his right. \"I miss old Bolles,\" he told  his foreman. \"You don't appreciate Bolles.\"    \"From what you tell of him,\" said Brock, \"I'll examine him more  careful.\"    Seeing their boss, the sparrow-hawk, back in his place, flanked with  supporters, and his gray eye indifferently upon them, the buccaroos grew  polite to oppressiveness. While Sam handed his dishes to Drake and  the new-comers, and the new-comers eat what was good before the old  inhabitants got a taste, these latter grew more and more solicitous.  They offered sugar to the strangers, they offered their beds; Half-past  Full urged them to sit companionably in the room where the fire was  burning. But when the meal was over, the visitors went to another room  with their arms, and lighted their own fire. They brought blankets from  their saddles, and after a little concertina they permitted the nearly  perished Uncle Pasco to slumber. Soon they slumbered themselves, with  the door left open, and Drake watching. He would not even share vigil  with Brock, and all night he heard the voices of the buccaroos, holding  grand, unending council.    When the relentless morning came, and breakfast with the visitors again  in their seats unapproachable, the drunkards felt the crisis to be a  strain upon their sobered nerves. They glanced up from their plates, and  down; along to Dean Drake eating his hearty porridge, and back at one  another, and at the hungry, well-occupied strangers.    \"Say, we don't want trouble,\" they began to the strangers.    \"Course you don't. Breakfast's what you're after.\"    \"Oh, well, you'd have got gay. A man gets gay.\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Mr. Drake,\" said Half-past Full, sweating with his effort, \"we were  sorry while we was a-fogging you up.\"    \"Yes,\" said Drake. \"You must have been just overcome by contrition.\"    A large laugh went up from the visitors, and the meal was finished  without further diplomacy.    \"One matter, Mr. Drake,\" stammered Half-past Full, as the party rose.  \"Our jobs. We're glad to pay for any things what got sort of broke.\"    \"Sort of broke,\" repeated the boy, eyeing him. \"So you want to hold your  jobs?\"    \"If--\" began the buccaroo, and halted.    \"Fact is, you're a set of cowards,\" said Drake, briefly. \"I notice  you've forgot to remove that whiskey jug.\" The demijohn still stood  by the great fireplace. Drake entered and laid hold of it, the crowd  standing back and watching. He took it out, with what remained in its  capacious bottom, set it on a stump, stepped back, levelled his gun, and  shattered the vessel to pieces. The whiskey drained down, wetting the  stump, creeping to the ground.    Much potency lies in the object-lesson, and a grin was on the faces of  all present, save Uncle Pasco's. It had been his demijohn, and when the  shot struck it he blinked nervously.    \"You ornery old mink!\" said Drake, looking at him. \"You keep to the  jewelry business hereafter.\"    The buccaroos grinned again. It was reassuring to witness wrath turn  upon another.    \"You want to hold your jobs?\" Drake resumed to them. \"You can trust  yourselves?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Half-past Full.    \"But I don't trust you,\" stated Drake, genially; and the buccaroos'  hopeful eyes dropped. \"I'm going to divide you,\" pursued the new  superintendent. \"Split you far and wide among the company's ranches.  Stir you in with decenter blood. You'll go to White-horse ranch, just  across the line of Nevada,\" he said to Half-past Full. \"I'm tired of the  brothers Drinker. You'll go--let's see--\"    Drake paused in his apportionment, and a sleigh came swiftly round the  turn, the horse loping and lathery.    \"What vas dat shooting I hear joost now?\" shouted Max Vogel, before he  could arrive. He did not wait for any answer. \"Thank the good God!\" he  exclaimed, at seeing the boy Dean Drake unharmed, standing with a gun.  And to their amazement he sped past them, never slacking his horse's  lope until he reached the corral. There he tossed the reins to the  placid Bolles, and springing out like a surefooted elephant, counted his  saddle-horses; for he was a general. Satisfied, he strode back to the  crowd by the demijohn. \"When dem men get restless,\" he explained to  Drake at once, \"always look out. Somebody might steal a horse.\"    The boy closed one gray, confidential eye at his employer. \"Just my  idea,\" said he, \"when I"]]]
