[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#7)"],[1," I am so happy!\" The quivering lips and the  dark eyes bright with tears spoke eloquently of her joy.    \"Major will you tell Captain Boggs to come over after supper? Isaac  will be able to talk a little by then, and he has some news of the  Indians,\" said Colonel Zane.    \"And ask the young man who saved my life to come that I may thank  him,\" said Isaac.    \"Saved your life?\" exclaimed Betty, turning to her brother, in  surprise, while a dark red flush spread over her face. A humiliating  thought had flashed into her mind.    \"Saved his life, of course,\" said Colonel Zane, answering for Isaac.  \"Young Clarke pulled him out of the river. Didn't he tell you?\"    \"No,\" said Betty, rather faintly.    \"Well, he is a modest young fellow. He saved Isaac's life, there is  no doubt of that. You will hear all about it after supper. Don't  make Isaac talk any more at present.\"    Betty hid her face on Isaac's shoulder and remained quiet a few  moments; then, rising, she kissed his cheek and went quietly to her  room. Once there she threw herself on the bed and tried to think.  The events of the day, coming after a long string of monotonous,  wearying days, had been confusing; they had succeeded one another in  such rapid order as to leave no time for reflection. The meeting by  the river with the rude but interesting stranger; the shock to her  dignity; Lydia's kindly advice; the stranger again, this time  emerging from the dark depths of disgrace into the luminous light as  the hero of her brother's rescue--all these thoughts jumbled in her  mind making it difficult for her to think clearly. But after a time  one thing forced itself upon her. She could not help being conscious  that she had wronged some one to whom she would be forever indebted.  Nothing could alter that. She was under an eternal obligation to the  man who had saved the life she loved best on earth. She had unjustly  scorned and insulted the man to whom she owed the life of her  brother.    Betty was passionate and quick-tempered, but she was generous and  tender-hearted as well, and when she realized how unkind and cruel  she kind been she felt very miserable. Her position admitted of no  retreat. No matter how much pride rebelled; no matter how much she  disliked to retract anything she had said, she knew no other course  lay open to her. She would have to apologize to Mr. Clarke. How  could she? What would she say? She remembered how cold and stern his  face had been as he turned from her to Lydia. Perplexed and unhappy,  Betty did what any girl in her position would have done: she  resorted to the consoling and unfailing privilege of her sex--a good  cry.    When she became composed again she got up and bathed her hot cheeks,  brushed her hair, and changed her gown for a becoming one of white.  She tied a red ribbon about her throat and put a rosette in her  hair. She had forgotten all about the Indians. By the time Mrs. Zane  called her for supper she had her mind made up to ask Mr. Clarke's  pardon, tell him she was sorry, and that she hoped they might be  friends.    Isaac Zane's fame had spread from the Potomac to Detroit and  Louisville. Many an anxious mother on the border used the story of  his captivity as a means to frighten truant youngsters who had  evinced a love for running wild in the woods. The evening of Isaac's  return every one in the settlement called to welcome home the  wanderer. In spite of the troubled times and the dark cloud hanging  over them they made the occasion one of rejoicing.    Old John Bennet, the biggest and merriest man in the colony, came in  and roared his appreciation of Isaac's return. He was a huge man,  and when he stalked into the room he made the floor shake with his  heavy tread. His honest face expressed his pleasure as he stood over  Isaac and nearly crushed his hand.    \"Glad to see you, Isaac. Always knew you would come back. Always  said so. There are not enough damn redskins on the river to keep you  prisoner.\"    \"I think they managed to keep him long enough,\" remarked Silas Zane.    \"Well, here comes the hero,\" said Colonel Zane, as Clarke entered,  accompanied by Captain Boggs, Major McColloch and Jonathan. \"Any  sign of Wetzel or the Indians?\"    Jonathan had not yet seen his brother, and he went over and seized  Isaac's hand and wrung it without speaking.    \"There are no Indians on this side of the river,\" said Major  McColloch, in answer to the Colonel's question.    \"Mr. Clarke, you do not seem impressed with your importance,\" said  Colonel Zane. \"My sister said you did not tell her what part you  took in Isaac's rescue.\"    \"I hardly deserve all the credit,\" answered Alfred. \"Your big black  dog merits a great deal of it.\"    \"Well, I consider your first day at the fort a very satisfactory  one, and an augury of that fortune you came west to find.\"    \"How are you?\" said Alfred, going up to the couch where Isaac lay.    \"I am doing well, thanks to you,\" said Isaac, warmly shaking  Alfred's hand.    \"It is good to see you pulling out all right,\" answered Alfred. \"I  tell you, I feared you were in a bad way when I got you out of the  water.\"    Isaac reclined on the couch with his head and shoulder propped up by  pillows. He was the handsomest of the brothers. His face would have  been but for the marks of privation, singularly like Betty's; the  same low, level brows and dark eyes; the same mouth, though the lips  were stronger and without the soft curves which made his sister's  mouth so sweet.    Betty appeared at the door, and seeing the room filled with men she  hesitated a moment before coming forward. In her white dress she  made such a dainty picture that she seemed out of place among those  surroundings. Alfred Clarke, for one, thought such a charming vision  was wasted on the rough settlers, every one of whom wore a faded and  dirty buckskin suit and a belt containing a knife and a tomahawk.  Colonel Zane stepped up to Betty and placing his arm around her  turned toward Clarke with pride in his eyes.    \"Betty, I want to make you acquainted with the hero of the hour, Mr.  Alfred Clarke. This is my sister.\"    Betty bowed to Alfred, but lowered her eyes instantly on  encountering the young man's gaze.    \"I have had the pleasure of meeting Miss Zane twice today,\" said  Alfred.    \"Twice?\" asked Colonel Zane, turning to Betty. She did not answer,  but disengaged herself from his arm and sat down by Isaac.    \"It was on the river road that I first met Miss Zane, although I did  not know her then,\" answered Alfred. \"I had some difficulty in  stopping her pony from going to Fort Pitt, or some other place down  the river.\"    \"Ha! Ha! Well, I know she rides that pony pretty hard,\" said Colonel  Zane, with his hearty laugh. \"I'll tell you, Clarke, we have some  riders here in the settlement. Have you heard of Major McColloch's  leap over the hill?\"    \"I have heard it mentioned, and I would like to hear the story,\"  responded Alfred. \"I am fond of horses, and think I can ride a  little myself. I am afraid I shall be compelled to change my mind.\"    \"That is a fine animal you rode from Fort Pitt,\" remarked the Major.  \"I would like to own him.\"    \"Come, draw your chairs up and he'll listen to Isaac's story,\" said  Colonel Zane.    \"I have not much of a story to tell,\" said Isaac, in a voice still  weak and low. \"I have some bad news, I am sorry to say, but I shall  leave that for the last. This year, if it had been completed, would  have made my tenth year as a captive of the Wyandots. This last  period of captivity, which has been nearly four years, I have not  been ill-treated and have enjoyed more comfort than any of you can  imagine. Probably you are all familiar with the reason for my long  captivity. Because of the interest of Myeerah, the Indian Princess,  they have importuned me for years to be adopted into the tribe,  marry the White Crane, as they call Myeerah, and become a Wyandot  chief. To this I would never consent, though I have been careful not  to provoke the Indians. I was allowed the freedom of the camp, but  have always been closely watched. I should still be with the Indians  had I not suspected that Hamilton, the British Governor, had formed  a plan with the Hurons, Shawnees, Delawares, and other tribes, to  strike a terrible blow at the whites along, the river. For months I  have watched the Indians preparing for an expedition, the extent of  which they had never before undertaken. I finally learned from  Myeerah that my suspicions were well founded. A favorable chance to  escape presented and I took it and got away. I outran all the  braves, even Arrowswift, the Wyandot runner, who shot me through the  arm. I have had a hard time of it these last three or four days,  living on herbs and roots, and when I reached the river I was ready  to drop. I pushed a log into the water and started to drift over.  When the old dog saw me I knew I was safe if I could hold on. Once,  when the young man pointed his gun at me, I thought it was all over.  I could not shout very loud.\"    \"Were you going to shoot?\" asked Colonel Zane of Clarke.    \"I took him for an Indian, but fortunately I discovered my mistake  in time,\" answered Alfred.    \"Are the Indians on the way here?\" asked Jonathan.    \"That I cannot say. At present the Wyandots are at home. But I know  that the British and the Indians will make a combined attack on the  settlements. It may be a month, or a year, but it is coming.\"    \"And Hamilton, the hair buyer, the scalp buyer, is behind the plan,\"  said Colonel Zane, in disgust.    \"The Indians have their wrongs. I sympathize with them in many ways.  We have robbed them, broken faith with them, and have not lived up  to the treaties. Pipe and Wingenund are particularly bitter toward  the whites. I understand Cornplanter is also. He would give anything  for Jonathan's scalp, and I believe any of the tribes would give a  hundred of their best warriors for 'Black Wind,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#7)"],[1,"the circle, and sitting before the  fire clasped their knees and talked. Hare listened awhile, and then,  being fatigued, he sought the cedar-tree where he had left his blankets.  The dry mat of needles made an odorous bed. He placed a sack of grain  for a pillow, and doubling up one blanket to lie upon, he pulled the  others over him. Then he watched and listened. The cedar-wood burned  with a clear flame, and occasionally snapped out a red spark. The voices  of the Navajos, scarcely audible, sounded \"toa's\" and \"taa's\"--syllables  he soon learned were characteristic and dominant--in low, deep murmurs.  It reminded Hare of something that before had been pleasant to his ear.  Then it came to mind: a remembrance of Mescal's sweet voice, and that  recalled the kinship between her and the Navajo chieftain. He looked  about, endeavoring to find her in the ring of light, for he felt in her  a fascination akin to the charm of this twilight hour. Dusky forms  passed to and fro under the trees; the tinkle of bells on hobbled  mustangs rang from the forest; coyotes had begun their night quest with  wild howls; the camp-fire burned red, and shadows flickered on the  blanketed Indians; the wind now moaned, now lulled in the cedars.    Hare lay back in his blankets and saw lustrous stars through the network  of branches. With their light in his face and the cold wind waving his  hair on his brow he thought of the strangeness of it all, of its  remoteness from anything ever known to him before, of its inexpressible  wildness. And a rush of emotion he failed wholly to stifle proved to him  that he could have loved this life if--if he had not of late come to  believe that he had not long to live. Still Naab's influence exorcised  even that one sad thought; and he flung it from him in resentment.    Sleep did not come so readily; he was not very well this night; the  flush of fever was on his cheek, and the heat of feverish blood burned  his body. He raised himself and, resolutely seeking for distraction,  once more stared at the camp-fire. Some time must have passed during his  dreaming, for only three persons were in sight. Naab's broad back was  bowed and his head nodded. Across the fire in its ruddy flicker sat  Eschtah beside a slight, dark figure. At second glance Hare recognized  Mescal. Surprise claimed him, not more for her presence there than for  the white band binding her smooth black tresses. She had not worn such  an ornament before. That slender band lent her the one touch which made  her a Navajo. Was it worn in respect to her aged grandfather? What did  this mean for a girl reared with Christian teaching? Was it desert  blood? Hare had no answers for these questions. They only increased the  mystery and romance. He fell asleep with the picture in his mind of  Eschtah and Mescal, sitting in the glow of the fire, and of August Naab,  nodding silently.    \"Jack, Jack, wake up.\" The words broke dully into his slumbers; wearily  he opened his eyes. August Naab bent over him, shaking him gently.    \"Not so well this morning, eh? Here's a cup of coffee. We're all packed  and starting. Drink now, and climb aboard. We expect to make Seeping  Springs to-night.\"    Hare rose presently and, laboring into the wagon, lay down on the sacks.  He had one of his blind, sickening headaches. The familiar lumbering of  wheels began, and the clanking of the wagon-chain. Despite jar and jolt  he dozed at times, awakening to the scrape of the wheel on the leathern  brake. After a while the rapid descent of the wagon changed to a roll,  without the irritating rattle. He saw a narrow valley; on one side the  green, slow-swelling cedar slope of the mountain; on the other the  perpendicular red wall, with its pinnacles like spears against the sky.  All day this backward outlook was the same, except that each time he  opened aching eyes the valley had lengthened, the red wall and green  slope had come closer together in the distance. By and by there came a  halt, the din of stamping horses and sharp commands, the bustle and  confusion of camp. Naab spoke kindly to him, but he refused any food,  lay still and went to sleep.    Daylight brought him the relief of a clear head and cooled blood. The  camp had been pitched close under the red wall. A lichen-covered cliff,  wet with dripping water, overhung a round pool. A ditch led the water  down the ridge to a pond. Cattle stood up to their knees drinking;  others lay on the yellow clay, which was packed as hard as stone; still  others were climbing the ridge and passing down on both sides.    \"You look as if you enjoyed that water,\" remarked Naab, when Hare  presented himself at the fire. \"Well, it's good, only a little salty.  Seeping Springs this is, and it's mine. This ridge we call The Saddle;  you see it dips between wall and mountain and separates two valleys.  This valley we go through to-day is where my cattle range. At the other  end is Silver Cup Spring, also mine. Keep your eyes open now, my lad.\"    How different was the beginning of this day! The sky was as blue as the  sea; the valley snuggled deep in the embrace of wall and mountain. Hare  took a place on the seat beside Naab and faced the descent. The line of  Navajos, a graceful straggling curve of color on the trail, led the way  for the white-domed wagons.    Naab pointed to a little calf lying half hidden under a bunch of sage.  \"That's what I hate to see. There's a calf, just born; its mother has  gone in for water. Wolves and lions range this valley. We lose hundreds  of calves that way.\"    As far as Hare could see red and white and black cattle speckled the  valley.    \"If not overstocked, this range is the best in Utah,\" said Naab. \"I say  Utah, but it's really Arizona. The Grand Canyon seems to us Mormons to  mark the line. There's enough browse here to feed a hundred thousand  cattle. But water's the thing. In some seasons the springs go almost  dry, though Silver Cup holds her own well enough for my cattle.\"    Hare marked the tufts of grass lying far apart on the yellow earth;  evidently there was sustenance enough in every two feet of ground to  support only one tuft.    \"What's that?\" he asked, noting a rolling cloud of dust with black  bobbing borders.    \"Wild mustangs,\" replied Naab. \"There are perhaps five thousand on the  mountain, and they are getting to be a nuisance. They're almost as bad  as sheep on the browse; and I should tell you that if sheep pass over a  range once the cattle will starve. The mustangs are getting too  plentiful. There are also several bands of wild horses.\"    \"What's the difference between wild horses and mustangs?\"    \"I haven't figured that out yet. Some say the Spaniards left horses in  here three hundred years ago. Wild? They are wilder than any naturally  wild animal that ever ran on four legs. Wait till you get a look at  Silvermane or Whitefoot.\"    \"What are they?\"    \"Wild stallions. Silvermane is an iron gray, with a silver mane, the  most beautiful horse I ever saw. Whitefoot's an old black shaggy demon,  with one white foot. Both stallions ought to be killed. They fight my  horses and lead off the mares. I had a chance to shoot Silvermane on the  way over this trip, but he looked so splendid that I just laid down my  rifle.\"    \"Can they run?\" asked Hare eagerly, with the eyes of a man who loved a  horse.    \"Run? Whew! Just you wait till you see Silvermane cover ground! He can  look over his shoulder at you and beat any horse in this country. The  Navajos have given up catching him as a bad job. Why--here! Jack! quick,  get out your rifle--coyotes!\"    Naab pulled on the reins, and pointed to one side. Hare discerned three  grayish sharp-nosed beasts sneaking off in the sage, and he reached back  for the rifle. Naab whistled, stopping the coyotes; then Hare shot. The  ball cut a wisp of dust above and beyond them. They loped away into the  sage.    \"How that rifle spangs!\" exclaimed Naab. \"It's good to hear it. Jack,  you shot high. That's the trouble with men who have never shot at game.  They can't hold low enough. Aim low, lower than you want. Ha! There's  another--this side--hold ahead of him and low, quick!--too high again.\"    It was in this way that August and Hare fell far behind the other  wagons. The nearer Naab got to his home the more genial he became. When  he was not answering Hare's queries he was giving information of his own  accord, telling about the cattle and the range, the mustangs, the  Navajos, and the desert. Naab liked to talk; he had said he had not the  gift of revelation, but he certainly had the gift of tongues.    The sun was in the west when they began to climb a ridge. A short  ascent, and a long turn to the right brought them under a bold spur of  the mountain which shut out the northwest. Camp had been pitched in a  grove of trees of a species new to Hare. From under a bowlder gushed the  sparkling spring, a grateful sight and sound to desert travellers. In a  niche of the rock hung a silver cup.    \"Jack, no man knows how old this cup is, or anything about it. We named  the spring after it--Silver Cup. The strange thing is that the cup has  never been lost nor stolen. But--could any desert man, or outlaw, or  Indian, take it away, after drinking here?\"    The cup was nicked and battered, bright on the sides, moss-green on the  bottom. When Hare drank from it he understood.    That evening there was rude merriment around the campfire. Snap Naab  buzzed on his jews'-harp and sang. He stirred some of the younger braves  to dancing, and they stamped and swung their arms, singing, \"hoya-heeya-  howya,\" as they moved in and out of the firelight.    Several of the braves showed great interest in Snap's jews'-harp and  repeatedly asked him for it. Finally the Mormon grudgingly lent it to a  curious Indian, who in trying to play it went through such awkward  motions and made such queer sounds that his companions set upon him and"]]]
