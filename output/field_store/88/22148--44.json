That, of course, was a very imperfect way of looking at  the value of these people, because the trade value of some of these Natives  was far greater than the trade value of some of our white people.  He had merely indicated these trade figures to show what an enormous asset  we had in the Natives in that respect.  Let them think  what the industry of the Natives had done for us.  Who had built our railways,  who had dug our mines, and developed this country as far as it was developed?  Who had been the actual manual worker who had done that?  The Native:  the coloured races of this country.  We must never forget  that we owed them a debt in that respect -- a debt not often acknowledged  by what we did for them.  Proceeding, he said that they ought to think  what they owed to the docility of the Natives, and the wonderfully easy way  in which they had been governed when treated properly.  He also paid a tribute  to the honesty of the Natives.    What must strike any one was the fact that though this Bill was really,  to a certain extent, a beginning, or was thought to be in certain quarters,  of a revolution in their dealing with the native races,  it was not even mentioned in the speech of the Governor-General.  It fell upon them like a bolt from the blue.  He remembered the afternoon.  They had heard a very impassioned and very heated speech  from the hon. member for Ficksburg on the enormous danger of squatting  in the Free State, and that was the occasion for introducing  a general statement of the policy of the Government towards the Natives  and the introduction of this Bill.  He did not think that that was the way  they liked to see a thing of this magnitude approached.  They often heard demands for what was called a general declaration of policy  with regard to native affairs -- a policy which should be applied  to the highest civilized Native, the owner of a farm, and the naked barbarian.  They could not do it.  People who demanded a general declaration of that kind  had not had the experience which some of them had had.  The hon. member who spoke before him said that he was in favour  of the underlying principle of the Bill.  What was the underlying principle?  The underlying principle was what one read into the Bill.  One hon. member read into it that it was the separation of the two races.  That might have been done when the two races first came in contact  at the Fish River, but it could not be done now.  Since then  they had been developing the country with the labour of these people.  They had been advancing by our aid.  They had mixed themselves up  with these people in an inextricable fashion and then some said  \"Haul your native policy out of the drawer and begin with  a policy of separation.\"  He was sure that the hon. member  who had brought in the Bill had no idea of that sort in his mind.  Another person had the idea that they were going to set up a sort of pale --  a sort of kraal in which they were going to drive these people.  Then another gentleman sneered at the policy hitherto adopted,  and he said that one side said that the policy towards the Natives  should be firm and just, while the other side said that it should be  just and firm.    It seemed to him that they had not got sufficient information.  Beyond the bald statistics which were given by the Minister  in the course of his interesting and moderate speech, they had nothing.  They were going into a thing that would stir South Africa from end to end,  and which affected hundreds of thousands of both races.  They had no information as to what were the ideas of the Natives.  It was unfortunate that, owing to this lack of information,  wrong ideas had got about with regard to this Bill.  It was difficult  to find out what the Native thought about these things; he doubted  whether anybody could say that he had got at the mind of the Native.  The only way, and he must say that he did not take it as a real indication,  was what they wrote in their newspapers.  He was alarmed, but not surprised,  at some of the articles in their newspapers, because they took their views  from the heated speeches and writings in party newspapers  all over the country, and they were very much alarmed.  He thought  that before a Bill of this sort was passed, there should be some attempt made  to get their views.  As far as one section was concerned,  the Bill was going to set up a sort of pale -- that there was going to be  a sort of kraal in which all the Natives were to be driven,  and they were to be left to develop on their own lines.  To allow them  to go on their own lines was merely to drive them back into barbarism;  their own lines meant barbarous lines; their own lines were cruel lines.  All along they had been bringing them away from their own lines.  It reminded him of what an English writer said about a similar policy  in Ireland, because when the English went to Ireland  they regarded the Native Irish in the way some extreme people here  regarded the Natives of South Africa.  They thought they would root them out.  They treated them as dogs, and thought that they were dogs.  They set up a pale.  They set the Irish within that pale,  to develop upon their own lines, but there were always Englishmen  living in that pale, just as in the same way they found Europeans  living among Natives.  Sir George Davis in describing this policy wrote  that it was the intention of the Government to set up a separation  between English and Irish, intending in time that the English should  root out the Irish.  If they changed the Irish for Natives they would see  how the illustration would apply.  A policy more foredoomed to failure  in South Africa could not be initiated.  It was a policy that  would keep South Africa back, perhaps for ever.  (Hear, hear.)  What would be the effect of driving these civilized Natives  back into reserves?  At the present time, every civilized man  -- if they treated him properly -- every civilized man  was becoming an owner of land outside native reserve, and therefore  he was an asset of strength to the country.  He was a loyalist.  He was not going to risk losing his property.  He was on  the side of the European.  If they drove these people back into reserve  they became our bitterest enemies.  Therefore, he viewed anything  that tended that way with the gravest suspicion.  Again, in this Bill  there was not sufficient distinction between those Natives  who tried to educate themselves and the ordinary raw barbarian.  They were all classed under the word \"Native\".    He came now to what was the main object of the Bill, and that was:  to do away with the squatting evil.  Why was there a squatting evil?  Was it the fault of the Native?  (An hon. member:  No.)  Was it the fault of the law?  (No.)  They had got the most stringent  laws concerning Natives of all the laws in the whole country,  in the Province of which his hon. friend (Mr. Keyter) was a member.  He did not think anything was more surprising than when they came to look  at the increases in the native population in the Orange Free State.  They had a huge native population in the Cape, and the increase  during the census periods from 1904 to 1911 -- he wanted hon. members  to pay some attention to this, because it showed the value of legislation --  the increase in the Cape Province during that period was 8.33 per cent.  In Natal, which had a huge -- in fact, an overwhelming -- native population,  curiously enough, the increase was the same, even to the actual  decimal figure, viz., 8.33 per cent.:  but some allowance must be made,  because a large number of Natives were out at work in the mines.  Now, in the Transvaal -- and in taking the Transvaal figures  these did not apply as regarded squatting, because the increase was mainly due  to the number of Natives employed in the mines.  In the Transvaal  the Natives increased by 30.1 per cent.  Now, when they came  to his friend's little State, where the most stringent laws were made  to keep out the Natives, how much did they suppose the Natives increased  in the Free State?  By no less than 44 per cent.  (Opposition cheers.)  Was that the fault of the Natives?  No, it was because  -- having the most stringent laws -- the people found it best  to evade those laws.  (Hear, hear.)  He hoped his hon. friend  would be a little tolerant.  Do let him pick the mote out of his own eye  before he tried to pick the beam out of other people's.  (Hear, hear.)  In the Free State these laws were very severe; for instance,  punishments -- amazing punishments -- were given, and yet the result  was the increase in five years by 44 per cent. of their native population.  This was something that they should take a warning by.  They were going  to do away with the squatter in appearance, but he would still survive  as a labour tenant.  They might do away with the labour tenant,  and he would still be surviving as a labour servant.  How was the Government  to distinguish between these?  They had in the Cape a law which stated  how many labour tenants a man should have upon his farm.    What they wanted in this country was administration and not more legislation,  and if they were to put the laws which they had into force in the Free State  at the present time he had no doubt that there would be a rebellion.  (Hear, hear.)  They would have platforms swarming with people  who would say that they could not grow one bag of mealies without the Natives.  But they had the laws to do it.  Now they went and tried in this Bill  to make a uniform law.  Turning towards the Minister, Mr. Merriman said:  \"My poor friend! that after all the years we had laboured together  he of all people should be the author of a uniform law on native matters!  (Laughter.)  I say this more in sorrow than in anger -- (laughter) --  because the conditions were totally different in the four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#7)"],[1,"anders nichts dann ein  muss- und sol-sin, geordnet von dem ewigen willen.

It must  and shall be and happen, that the outer man says--and is so also in  truth--'I will neither be nor not be, neither live nor die, neither  know nor not know, neither do nor leave undone--and everything which is  similar to this, but I am ready and obedient to do everything, which  must and shall be done, be it passively or actively.'  And thus has the  outer man no question or desire, but to, satisfy only the Eternal Will.  When this will be known in truth, that the inner man shall stand,  immovable, and that the outer man shall and must be moved,--the inner  man has a why and wherefore of his moving, which is nothing but an 'it  must and shall be' ordered by the Eternal Will.  And if God himself  were or is the man, it would be so.  This is well seen in Christ.  And  what in the Divine Light is and from the Divine Light, has neither  spiritual pride nor careless license nor an independent spirit--but a  great humility, and a broken and contrite heart,--and all propriety and  honesty, justice and truth, peace and happiness,--all that belongs to  all virtues, it must have.  When it is otherwise, then he is not happy,  as has been said.  When this does not help to this union, then there is  nothing which may hinder it but man alone with his own will, which does  him such great harm.  That, one ought to know.\"    \"This is sufficient,\" said she; \"I believe we understand each other  now.  In another place, our unknown friend says still more unmistakably  that no man is passive before death, and that the glorified man is like  the hand of God, which does nothing of itself except as God wills; or,  like a house in which God dwells.  A God-possessed man feels this  perfectly, but does not speak of it.  He treasures his life in God like  a love secret.  It often seems to me like that silver poplar before my  window.  It is perfectly still at evening, and not a leaf trembles or  stirs.  When the morning breeze rustles and tosses every leaf, the  trunk with its branches stands still and immovable, and when autumn  conies, though every leaf which once rustled falls to the ground and  withers, the trunk waits for a new spring.\"    She had lived so deep a life in her world that I did not wish to  disturb it.  I had but just released myself with difficulty from the  magic circle of these thoughts, and scarcely knew whether she had not  chosen the better part which could not be taken away from her; while we  have so much trouble and care.    Thus every evening brought its new conversation, and with each evening,  some new phase of her fathomless mind disclosed itself.  She kept no  secret from me.  Her talk was only thinking and feeling aloud, and what  she said must have dwelt with her many long years, for she poured out  her thoughts as freely as a child that picks its lap full of flowers  and then sprinkles them upon the grass.  I could not disclose my soul  to her as freely as she did to me, and this oppressed and pained me.  Yet how few can, with those continual deceptions imposed upon us by  society, called manners, politeness, consideration, prudence, and  worldly wisdom, which make our entire life a masquerade!  How few, even  when they would, can regain the complete truth of their existence!  Love itself dares not speak its own language and maintain its own  silence, but must learn the set phrases of the poet and idealize, sigh  and flirt instead of freely greeting, beholding and surrendering  itself, I would most gladly have confessed and said to her: \"You know  me not,\" but I found that the words were not wholly true.  Before I  left, I gave her a volume of Arnold's poems, which I had had a short  time, and begged her to read the one called \"The Buried Life.\"  It was  my confession, and then I kneeled at her couch and said \"Good Night.\"  \"Good Night,\" said she, and laid her hand upon my head, and again her  touch thrilled through, every limb and the dreams of childhood uprose  in my soul.  I could not go, but gazed into her deep unfathomable eyes  until the peace of her soul completely overshadowed mine.  Then I arose  and went home in silence--and in the night I dreamed of the silver  poplar around which the wind roared--but not a leaf stirred on its  branches.        THE BURIED LIFE.      Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet    Behold, with tears my eyes are wet;    I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.      Yes, yes, we know that we can jest;    We know, we know that we can smile;    But there's a something in this breast    To which thy light words bring no rest,    And thy gay smiles no anodyne.      Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,    And turn those limpid eyes on mine,    And, let me read there, love, thy inmost soul.      Alas, is even love too weak    To unlock the heart, and let it speak?    Are even lovers powerless to reveal    To one another what indeed they feel?    I knew the mass of men concealed    Their thoughts, for fear that if revealed    They would by other men be met    With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;    I knew they lived and moved,    Tricked in disguises, alien to the rest    Of men and alien to themselves--and yet,    The same heart beats in every human breast.      But we, my love--does a like spell benumb    Our hearts--our voices?--must we too be dumb?      Ah! well for us, if even we,    Even for a moment, can yet free    Our hearts and have our lips unchained;    For that which seals them hath been deep ordained.    Fate which foresaw    How frivolous a baby man would be,    By what distractions he would be possessed,    How he would pour himself in every strife,    And well-nigh change his own identity,    That it might keep from his capricious play    His genuine self, and force him to obey,    Even in his own despite, his being's law,    Bade through the deep recesses of our breast    The unregarded River of our Life,    Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;    And that we should not see    The buried stream, and seem to be    Eddying about in blind uncertainty,    Though driving on with it eternally.      But often, in the world's most crowded streets,    But often in the din of strife,    There rises an unspeakable desire    After the knowledge of our buried life;      A thirst to spend our fire and restless force    In tracking out our true original course;    A longing to inquire    Into the mystery of this heart that beats    So wild, so deep, in us; to know    Whence our thoughts come, and where they go.    And many a man in his own breast then delves,    But deep enough, alas, none ever mines;    And we have been on many thousand lines,    And we have shown on each, talent and power,    But hardly have we, for one little hour,    Been on our own line, have we been ourselves;    Hardly had skill to utter one of all    The nameless feelings that course through our breast,    But they course on forever unexpressed.    And long we try in vain to speak and act    Our hidden self, and what we say and do    Is eloquent, is well--but 'tis not true.      And then we will no more be racked    With inward striving, and demand    Of all the thousand nothings of the hour    Their stupefying power;    Ah! yes, and they benumb us at our call;    Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,    From the soul's subterranean depth upborne,    As from an infinitely distant land,    Come airs and floating echoes, and convey    A melancholy into all our day.      Only--but this is rare--    When a beloved hand is laid in ours,    When, jaded with the rush and glare    Of the interminable hours,    Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,    When our world-deafened ear    Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed,--    A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,    And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again:    The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,    And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know;      A man becomes aware of his life's flow,    And, hears its winding murmur, and he sees    The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.      And there arrives a lull in the hot race    Wherein he doth forever chase    That flying and elusive shadow, Rest;    An air of coolness plays upon his face,    And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.      And then he thinks he knows    The Hills where his life rose,    And the Sea where it goes. . . . . . .          SIXTH MEMORY.    Early the next morning, there was a knock at the door, and my old doctor,  the Hofrath, entered.  He was the friend, the body-and-soul-guardian of  our entire little village.  He had seen two generations grow up.  Children whom he had brought into the world had in turn become fathers  and mothers, and he treated them as his children.
