Gal. 4. 6.    1 Behold what wondrous grace  The Father hath bestow'd  On sinners of a mortal race,  To call them sons of God!    2 'Tis no surprising thing  That we should be unknown;  The Jewish world knew not their King,  God's everlasting Son.    3 Nor doth it yet appear  How great we must be made;  But when we see our Saviour here,  We shall be like our head.    4 A hope so much divine  May trials well endure,  May purge our souls from sense and sin,  As Christ the Lord is pure.    5 If in my Father's love  I share a filial part,  Send down thy Spirit like a dove  To rest upon my heart.    6 We would no longer lie  Like slaves beneath the throne;  My faith shall Abba, Father, cry,  And thou the kindred own.      Hymn 1:65.  The kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms  of our Lord; or, The day of judgment, Rev. 11. 15-18.    1 Let the seventh angel sound on high,  Let shouts be heard thro' all the sky;  Kings of the earth, with glad accord  Give up your kingdoms to the Lord.    2 Almighty God, thy power assume,  Who wast, and art, and art to come:  Jesus, the Lamb, who once was slain,  For ever live, for ever reign.    3 The angry nations fret and roar,  That they can slay the saints no more;  On wings of vengeance flies our God  To pay the long arrears of blood.    4 Now must the rising dead appear,  Now the decisive sentence hear;  Now the dear martyrs of the Lord  Receive an infinite reward.      Hymn 1:66.  Christ the King at his table, Cant. (Transcriber's Note:  Song of Solomon) 1. 2-5 12 13 17.    1 Let him embrace my soul, and prove  Mine interest in his heavenly love:  The voice that tells me, \"Thou art mine,\"  Exceeds the blessings of the vine.    2 On thee th' anointing Spirit came,  And spreads the savour of thy name;  That oil of gladness and of grace  Draws virgin souls to meet thy face.    3 Jesus, allure me by thy charms,  My soul shall fly into thine arms,  Our wandering feet thy favours bring  To the fair chambers of the King.    4 [Wonder and pleasure tune our voice  To speak thy praises and our joys:  Our memory keeps this love of thine  Beyond the taste of richest wine.]    5 Tho' in ourselves deform'd we are,  And black as Kedar tent appear,  Yet when we put thy beauties on,  Fair as the courts of Solomon.    6 While at his table sits the King,  He loves to see us smile and sing;  Our graces are our best perfume,  And breathe like spikenard round the room.]    7 As myrrh new bleeding from the tree,  Such is a dying Christ to me;  And while he makes my soul his guest,  My bosom, Lord, shall be thy rest.    8 [No beams of cedar or of fir  Can with thy courts on earth compare;  And here we wait until thy love  Raise us to nobler seats above.]      Hymn 1:67.  Seeking the pastures of Christ the Shepherd, Cant. 1.7.    1 Thou whom my soul admires above  All earthly joy, and earthly love,  Tell me, dear shepherd, let me know,  Where doth thy sweetest pasture grow?    2 Where is the shadow of that rock  That from the son defends thy flock?  Fain would I feed among thy sheep,  Among them rest, among them sleep.    3 Why should thy bride appear like one  That turns aside to paths unknown?  My constant feet would never rove,  Would never seek another love.    4 [The footsteps of thy flock I see;  Thy sweetest pastures here they be;  A wondrous feast thy love prepares,  Bought with thy wounds, and groans, and tears.    5 His dearest flesh he makes my food,  And bids me drink his richest blood;  Here to these hills my soul will come,  To my beloved lead me home.]      Hymn 1:68.  The banquet of love, Cant. 2. 1 2 3 4 6 7.    1 Behold the Rose of Sharon here,  The Lily which the vallies bear;  Behold the Tree of Life, that gives  Refreshing fruit and healing leaves.    2 Amongst the thorns so lilies shine,  Amongst wild gourds the noble vine;  So in mine eyes my Saviour proves  Amidst a thousand meaner loves.    3 Beneath his cooling shade I sat  To shield me from the burning heat;  Of heavenly fruit he spreads a feast  To feed my eyes and please my taste.    4 [Kindly he brought me to the place  Where stands the banquet of his grace,  He saw me faint, and o'er my head  The banner of his love he spread.    5 With living bread and generous wine  He cheers this sinking heart of mine;  And opening his own heart to me,  He shews his thoughts how kind they be.]    6 O never let my Lord depart,  Lie down and rest upon my heart;  I charge my sins not once to move  Nor stir, nor wake, nor grieve my Love.      Hymn 1:69.  Christ appearing to his church, and seeking her  company, Cant. 2. 1-13.    1 The voice of my beloved sounds  Over the rocks and rising grounds,  O'er hills of guilt, and seas of grief,  He leaps, he flies to my relief.    2 Now thro' the veil of flesh I see  With eyes of love he looks at me;  Now in the gospel's clearest glass  He shews the beauties of his face.    3 Gently he draws my heart along  Both with his beauties and his tongue;  \"Rise,\" saith my Lord, \"make haste away;  \"No mortal joys are worth thy stay.    4 \"The Jewish wintery state is gone,  \"The mists are fled, the spring comes on,  \"The sacred turtle-dove we hear  \"Proclaim the new, the joyful year.    5 \"Th' immortal vine of heavenly root  \"Blossoms and buds, and gives her fruit:\"  Lo, we are come to taste the wine;  Our souls rejoice and bless the vine.    6 And when we hear our Jesus say,  \"Rise up, my love, make haste away!\"  Our hearts would fain out-fly the wind,  And leave all earthly loves behind.      Hymn 1:70.  Christ inviting, and the church answering the  invitation, Cant. 2. 14 16 17.    1 [Hark, the Redeemer from on high  Sweetly invites his favourites nigh;  From caves of darkness and of doubt,  He gently speaks, and calls us out:    2 \"My dove, who hidest in the rock,  \"Thine heart almost with sorrow broke,  \"Lift up thy face, forget thy fear,  \"And let thy voice delight mine ear.    3 \"Thy voice to me sounds ever sweet;  \"My graces in thy countenance meet;  \"Tho' the vain world thy face despise,  \"'Tis bright and comely in mine eyes.\"    4 Dear Lord, our thankful heart receives  The hope thine invitation gives:  'To thee our joyful lips shall raise  The voice of prayer, and of praise.]    5 [I am my Love's, and he is mine;  Our hearts, our hopes, our passions join:  Nor let a motion, nor a word,  Nor thought arise to grieve my Lord.    6 My soul to pastures fair he leads,  Amongst the lilies where he feeds;  Amongst the saints (whose robes are white,  Wash'd in his blood) is his delight.    7 Till the day break, and shadows flee,  Till the sweet dawning light I see,  Thine eyes to me-ward often turn,  Nor let my soul in darkness mourn.    8 Be like a hart on mountains green,  Leap o'er the hills of fear and sin;  Nor guilt, nor unbelief divide  My Love, my Saviour from my side.]      Hymn 1:71.  Christ found in the street, and brought to the church,  Cant. 3. 1-5.    1 Often I seek my Lord by night,  Jesus, my love, my soul's delight;  With warm desire and restless thought  I seek him oft, but find him not.    2 Then I arise, and search the street  Till I my Lord, my Saviour meet;  I ask the watchmen of the night,  \"Where did you see my soul's delight?\"    3 Sometimes I find him in the way,  Directed by a heavenly ray;  I leap for joy to see his face,  And hold him fast in mine embrace.    4 [I bring him to my mother's home,  Nor does my Lord refuse to come,  To Sion's sacred chambers, where  My soul first drew the vital air.    5 He gives me there his bleeding heart,  Pierc'd for my sake with deadly smart;  I give my soul to him, and there  Our loves their mutual tokens share.]    6 I charge you all, ye earthly toys,  Approach not to disturb my joys;  Nor sin, nor hell come near my heart,  Nor cause my Saviour to depart.      Hymn 1:72.  The coronation of Christ, and espousals of the church,  Cant. 3. 2.    1 Daughters of Sion, come, behold  The crown of honour and of gold,  Which the glad church with joys unknown  Plac'd on the head of Solomon.    2 Jesus, thou everlasting King,  Accept the tribute which we bring,  Accept the well-deserv'd renown,  And wear our praises as thy crown.    3 Let every act of worship be  Like our espousals, Lord, to thee;  Like the dear hour, when from above  We first receiv'd thy pledge of love.    4 The gladness of that happy day,  Our hearts would wish it long to stay,  Nor let our faith forsake its hold,  Nor comfort sink, nor love grow cold.    5 Each following minute as it flies,  Increase thy praise, improve our joys,  Till we are rais'd to sing thy Name  At the great supper of the Lamb.    6 O that the months would roll away,  And bring that coronation-day!  The King of Grace shall fill the throne  With all his Father's glories on.      Hymn 1:73.  The church's beauty in the eyes of Christ,  Cant. 4. 1 10 11 7 9 8.    1 Kind is the speech of Christ our Lord,  Affection sounds in every word,  \"Lo, thou art fair, my love, he cries,  \"Not the young doves have sweeter eyes.    2 [\"Sweet are thy lips, thy pleasing voice  \"Salutes mine ear with secret joys,  \"No spice so much delights the smell,  \"Nor milk nor honey taste so well.]    3 \"Thou art all fair, my bride, to me,  \"I will behold no spot in thee.\"  What mighty wonders love performs,  And puts a comeliness on worms!    4 Defil'd and loathsome as we are,  He makes us white, and calls us fair;  Adorns us with that heavenly dress,  His graces and his righteousness.    5 \"My sister, and my spouse,\" he cries,  \"Bound to my heart by various ties,  \"Thy powerful love my heart detains  \"In strong delight and pleasing chains.\"    6 He calls me from the leopard's den,  From this wild world of beasts and men,  To Sion where his glories are;  Not Lebanon is half so fair.    7 Nor dens of prey, nor flowery plains  Nor earthly joys, nor earthly pains  Shall hold my feet, or force my stay,  When Christ invites my soul away.      Hymn 1:74.  The church the garden of Christ, Cant. 4. 12 14 15,  and 5. 1.    1 We are a garden"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],[0,"Wildflowers of the Farm (#7)"],[1,"ield; not much, Mr.  Hammond will be glad to know, for he has been trying for many years to  get rid of this plant altogether. Pretty as the yellow blossoms of the  Charlock are, it is one of the most troublesome weeds which the farmer  has to fight. It is only an annual certainly, and each seed-pod holds no  more than six or seven seeds. The seeds, however, are oily, and this  oiliness preserves them. If they are ploughed deep into the ground, they  may live there for several years, and will produce a plant when turned  up again by the plough or the scuffle.    Mr. Hammond tells me that some years ago this field was full of  Charlock, and in the early summer there would be more Charlock than  wheat to be seen. This is how he got rid of it. Every year he ploughed  the field and got it ready for the crop as early as possible. Then the  Charlock sprang up before the crop of corn or turnips was sown; thus it  could be rooted out. Still, as we see to-day, there is a little left,  though it is growing less each year.    Charlock is wild mustard. There is more seed than blossom here to-day,  for the flowering time for Charlock is in June. If we chew some seed  from a pod, we shall find it hot and biting to the tongue. In some parts  of England many farmers grow mustard as one of their crops.    Near Willow Farm some farmers grow mustard as a catch-crop. They sow it  in autumn, as soon as another crop has been taken off the field. In the  spring it is eaten by sheep, or else it is ploughed in. A catch-crop  ploughed in like this enriches the land. Moreover a number of weeds are  buried with the catch-crop before they have time to blossom and to shed  their seed.    The yellow blossom of the Charlock is pretty, and the Poppy is the  finest scarlet wild flower we have. There is a third flower among the  wheat to-day, the beautiful blue Corn Flower or Corn Bluebottle. It is  no more welcome to the farmer than the Poppy and the Charlock are. It is  a perennial, and therefore difficult to get rid of. Moreover when we  pull up a stem we find it quite hard work, it is so tough. These tough  stems blunt the sickles of the reapers and the knives of the reaping  machine.    [Illustration left: CREEPING FIELD THISTLE.]    [Illustration right: FIELD SCABIOUS.]    [Illustration left: EVERGREEN ALKANET.]    [Illustration center: CORNFLOWER.]    [Illustration right: SMALLER BINDWEED.]    [Illustration: CHARLOCK.]    To us it is only a very beautiful flower. The florets in the centre of  each blossom are dark purple, but the outer ones are of a brighter blue.  The leaves are long and narrow; those near the bottom of the stem are  rather broader than those higher up. The stems themselves are not round,  but angular. We can feel corners or angles as we hold one in our hand.  They are also covered with a kind of down.    There is another flower which we shall see better if we come to the  stubble field after the wheat is cut; but some of it is near the gate  to-day. This is the Smaller Bindweed. We see that it is a relation of  the Large Bindweed in the garden hedge. It has leaves and flowers of the  same shape, but the flowers are smaller, and are pink and white. Those  of the Large Bindweed are rarely anything but pure white.    This is another troublesome weed here. It does not climb, as the Large  Bindweed does, but creeps along the ground, twining round everything it  meets. In the potato field it is often even more troublesome than here.  Corn is _cut_, but potatoes are _dug_ out of the ground. The Small  Bindweed forms such a thick carpet over the field, and twines round the  potato stems so closely, that it is often very difficult to dig up the  potatoes.    Here is another little flower which I am glad to show you now, the  Scarlet Pimpernel. This and the Poppy are the only _scarlet_ wild  flowers we have. There are many _pink_, and also many _purple_ flowers,  but only these two are really _scarlet_.    The Pimpernel differs from the Poppy in almost everything except its  colour. The Poppy has a tall stout stem and its blossoms are very  large. The Pimpernel trails on the ground and has tiny flowers. The  blossoms of the Poppy have four petals, those of the Pimpernel have  five. These are a beautiful scarlet, but not _quite_ so bright a scarlet  as those of the Poppy.    The leaves grow in pairs, and the small bare stalks which carry a flower  at their ends spring from the stem beside the leaves. The leaves are  sessile on the stem. Turning a leaf over we find that on its under side  are black or dark purple spots.    [Illustration: PIMPERNEL.]    The blossoms of the Pimpernel close up when rain is near, and it is  often called the Poor Man's Weatherglass. Sometimes, but very rarely, a  plant is found which has pink, or even pure white blossoms. There is  also a blue Pimpernel. Another Pimpernel is the Bog Pimpernel; but we  shall not find it in this dry field of corn, as you may guess by the  name.    One more flower we will look at, and then it will be time to leave our  corn-field and to search elsewhere. Growing on the hedgebank at the side  of the field is a pretty lilac-blue flower on a long bare stalk. It is  the Field Scabious.    The blossoms are in shape like a round ball very much flattened--like a  round pincushion. There are no large petals here, as with the Poppy, but  a great number of small florets. Those on the outer edge of the blossom  are larger than those inside. Each floret is a tiny tube or pipe.    The leaves are on separate stalks from those which bear the flowers, and  they grow in pairs. They are divided into several pairs of lobes, with a  single lobe at the end of each leaf. Some leaves grow from that part of  the stem which is underground, and these are larger than the others, and  are sometimes of a different shape. Both the leaves and the stem are  hairy.          CHAPTER XI    ON THE CHASE      We have now seen a good many Flowers of the Farm; we have found them in  the coppice, on the garden wall, and in the fields. To-day we will go a  little further off, three miles away.    You say, \"Surely that is a long way off for the farmer to have a field.\"  It is not exactly a field. The Chase is a great open common or moor,  which belongs to the village or parish where Willow Farm is. Nearly all  the people of the village have certain rights of pasturage on it; they  may let their horses and cattle and sheep graze there. Every now and  then Mr. Hammond sends some of his sheep to the Chase to feed there for  a few weeks. It is very high dry ground, and that is good for sheep.    The road runs through the middle of the great common without any hedge  or fence on either side. There are horses and sheep and cattle here on  this May morning; donkeys too. All the sheep are marked, and we soon see  some which belong to Willow Farm; they are stamped on the back in large  letters \"W.H.\" for William Hammond. A farmer easily knows his own horses  and cows; sheep are less easy to recognise, and are usually marked.    [Illustration: GORSE.]    One of the flowers of the Chase we see at once. In whatever direction we  look across the common there is a perfect blaze of gold--the blossoms of  the prickly Gorse or Furze. Spring is the time to see its mass of golden  yellow blossoms best; but I do not think there is a week, or even a day,  in the whole year when some of the flowers are not out. Did you ever  hear the saying, \"Kissing is out of season when the Gorse is out of  bloom.\" That is never!    The Gorse flowers are beautiful and their scent is sweet. As to  gathering them, however, there is a terrible difficulty. The flowers  grow among long sharp spikes which cover the stems closely; you would  almost as soon gather nettles! There are very few real leaves, and they  are small and not easily seen; but the thorns are beautiful to look at,  if not to touch--they are such a rich dark green.    Nor is Gorse a useless plant. If the prickly stems are bruised or mashed  a little they form a fodder which animals like. Indeed, a pony near us  seems to enjoy them as they are; he is tearing off and eating piece  after piece from a Gorse bush. His mouth must be less tender than ours!    Later in the summer we visit the Chase again to find some flowers that  were not out in May. On our way we pass a potato field in blossom--a  very pretty sight. These blossoms are a palish purple, but sometimes the  potato flowers are white.    The Hairbell is a flower which we shall now find on the Chase--a great  contrast to the stout and thorny bush of Gorse. The Hairbell's stem is  almost as slender as a thread, although it stands upright. Each blossom  is a dainty little blue bell of five petals. White blossoms are  sometimes found, but not often.    There are leaves as well as flowers on the stem. Growing from the lower  part of the stem, close to the ground, we may perhaps find some broader,  rounder leaves; perhaps not, however, for these lower leaves soon wither  and die away.    [Illustration: HAIRBELL.]    The Hairbell loves to grow where there is fresh pure air. Here on the  Chase we are high up; it has been a long steep climb from Willow Farm,  and we are more than five hundred feet above sea level. Far below us, a  few miles away, we see a broad river on which steamers and sailing-ships  are passing up and down. Away to the west is the sea, from which a  breeze is nearly always blowing across the Chase. No wonder that the  little Hairbell loves the spot.    We have found a yellow flower and a blue one on the Chase, and now we  have not far to look for something red. Here is a clump of Heath or  Ling, and not far off a patch of Heather too. We must be careful to  distinguish Heath from Heather; let us look at the Heath first.    On the Heath, as on the Hairbell, we find bell-shaped flowers; but the  blossoms of the Heath are very small, and grow from a tough woody stem.  They are a reddish-purple. On little side branches"]]]
