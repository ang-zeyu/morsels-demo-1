I merely have told  you of that which you saw was on my mind. You have surely before heard  of such things.\"    \"I have--I have.\"    \"I much marvel, then, that the supposition did not occur to you, Henry.\"    \"It did not--it did not, Marchdale. It--it was too dreadful, I suppose,  to find a home in my heart. Oh! Flora, Flora, if this horrible idea  should once occur to you, reason cannot, I am quite sure, uphold you  against it.\"    \"Let no one presume to insinuate it to her, Henry. I would not have it  mentioned to her for worlds.\"    \"Nor I--nor I. Good God! I shudder at the very thought--the mere  possibility; but there is no possibility, there can be none. I will not  believe it.\"    \"Nor I.\"    \"No; by Heaven's justice, goodness, grace, and mercy, I will not believe  it.\"    \"Tis well sworn, Henry; and now, discarding the supposition that Flora  has been visited by a vampyre, let us seriously set about endeavouring,  if we can, to account for what has happened in this house.\"    \"I--I cannot now.\"    \"Nay, let us examine the matter; if we can find any natural explanation,  let us cling to it, Henry, as the sheet-anchor of our very souls.\"    \"Do you think. You are fertile in expedients. Do you think, Marchdale;  and, for Heaven's sake, and for the sake of our own peace, find out some  other way of accounting for what has happened, than the hideous one you  have suggested.\"    \"And yet my pistol bullets hurt him not; he has left the tokens of his  presence on the neck of Flora.\"    \"Peace, oh! peace. Do not, I pray you, accumulate reasons why I should  receive such a dismal, awful superstition. Oh, do not, Marchdale, as you  love me!\"    \"You know that my attachment to you,\" said Marchdale, \"is sincere; and  yet, Heaven help us!\"    His voice was broken by grief as he spoke, and he turned aside his head  to hide the bursting tears that would, despite all his efforts, show  themselves in his eyes.    \"Marchdale,\" added Henry, after a pause of some moments' duration, \"I  will sit up to-night with my sister.\"    \"Do--do!\"    \"Think you there is a chance it may come again?\"    \"I cannot--I dare not speculate upon the coming of so dreadful a  visitor, Henry; but I will hold watch with you most willingly.\"    \"You will, Marchdale?\"    \"My hand upon it. Come what dangers may, I will share them with you,  Henry.\"    \"A thousand thanks. Say nothing, then, to George of what we have been  talking about. He is of a highly susceptible nature, and the very idea  of such a thing would kill him.\"    \"I will; be mute. Remove your sister to some other chamber, let me beg  of you, Henry; the one she now inhabits will always be suggestive of  horrible thoughts.\"    \"I will; and that dreadful-looking portrait, with its perfect likeness  to him who came last night.\"    \"Perfect indeed. Do you intend to remove it?\"    \"I do not. I thought of doing so; but it is actually on the panel in the  wall, and I would not willingly destroy it, and it may as well remain  where it is in that chamber, which I can readily now believe will become  henceforward a deserted one in this house.\"    \"It may well become such.\"    \"Who comes here? I hear a step.\"    There was a tip at the door at this moment, and George made his  appearance in answer to the summons to come in. He looked pale and ill;  his face betrayed how much he had mentally suffered during that night,  and almost directly he got into the bed-chamber he said,--    \"I shall, I am sure, be censured by you both for what I am going to say;  but I cannot help saying it, nevertheless, for to keep it to myself  would destroy me.\"    \"Good God, George! what is it?\" said Mr. Marchdale.    \"Speak it out!\" said Henry.    \"I have been thinking of what has occurred here, and the result of that  thought has been one of the wildest suppositions that ever I thought I  should have to entertain. Have you never heard of a vampyre?\"    Henry sighed deeply, and Marchdale was silent.    \"I say a vampyre,\" added George, with much excitement in his manner. \"It  is a fearful, a horrible supposition; but our poor, dear Flora has been  visited by a vampyre, and I shall go completely mad!\"    He sat down, and covering his face with his hands, he wept bitterly and  abundantly.    \"George,\" said Henry, when he saw that the frantic grief had in some  measure abated--\"be calm, George, and endeavour to listen to me.\"    \"I hear, Henry.\"    \"Well, then, do not suppose that you are the only one in this house to  whom so dreadful a superstition has occurred.\"    \"Not the only one?\"    \"No; it has occurred to Mr. Marchdale also.\"    \"Gracious Heaven!\"    \"He mentioned it to me; but we have both agreed to repudiate it with  horror.\"    \"To--repudiate--it?\"    \"Yes, George.\"    \"And yet--and yet--\"    \"Hush, hush! I know what you would say. You would tell us that our  repudiation of it cannot affect the fact. Of that we are aware; but yet  will we disbelieve that which a belief in would be enough to drive us  mad.\"    \"What do you intend to do?\"    \"To keep this supposition to ourselves, in the first place; to guard it  most zealously from the ears of Flora.\"    \"Do you think she has ever heard of vampyres?\"    \"I never heard her mention that in all her reading she had gathered even  a hint of such a fearful superstition. If she has, we must be guided by  circumstances, and do the best we can.\"    \"Pray Heaven she may not!\"    \"Amen to that prayer, George,\" said Henry. \"Mr. Marchdale and I intend  to keep watch over Flora to-night.\"    \"May not I join you?\"    \"Your health, dear George, will not permit you to engage in such  matters. Do you seek your natural repose, and leave it to us to do the  best we can in this most fearful and terrible emergency.\"    \"As you please, brother, and as you please, Mr. Marchdale. I know I am a  frail reed, and my belief is that this affair will kill me quite. The  truth is, I am horrified--utterly and frightfully horrified. Like my  poor, dear sister, I do not believe I shall ever sleep again.\"    \"Do not fancy that, George,\" said Marchdale. \"You very much add to the  uneasiness which must be your poor mother's portion, by allowing this  circumstance to so much affect you. You well know her affection for you  all, and let me therefore, as a very old friend of hers, entreat you to  wear as cheerful an aspect as you can in her presence.\"    \"For once in my life,\" said George, sadly, \"I will; to my dear mother,  endeavour to play the hypocrite.\"    \"Do so,\" said Henry. \"The motive will sanction any such deceit as that,  George, be assured.\"    The day wore on, and Poor Flora remained in a very precarious situation.  It was not until mid-day that Henry made up his mind he would call in a  medical gentleman to her, and then he rode to the neighbouring  market-town, where he knew an extremely intelligent practitioner  resided. This gentleman Henry resolved upon, under a promise of secrecy,  makings confidant of; but, long before he reached him, he found he might  well dispense with the promise of secrecy.    He had never thought, so engaged had he been with other matters, that  the servants were cognizant of the whole affair, and that from them he  had no expectation of being able to keep the whole story in all its  details. Of course such an opportunity for tale-bearing and gossiping  was not likely to be lost; and while Henry was thinking over how he had  better act in the matter, the news that Flora Bannerworth had been  visited in the night by a vampyre--for the servants named the visitation  such at once--was spreading all over the county.    As he rode along, Henry met a gentleman on horseback who belonged to the  county, and who, reining in his steed, said to him,    \"Good morning, Mr. Bannerworth.\"    \"Good morning,\" responded Henry, and he would have ridden on, but the  gentleman added,--    \"Excuse me for interrupting you, sir; but what is the strange story that  is in everybody's mouth about a vampyre?\"    Henry nearly fell off his horse, he was so much astonished, and,  wheeling the animal around, he said,--    \"In everybody's mouth!\"    \"Yes; I have heard it from at least a dozen persons.\"    \"You surprise me.\"    \"It is untrue? Of course I am not so absurd as really to believe about  the vampyre; but is there no foundation at all for it? We generally find  that at the bottom of these common reports there is a something around  which, as a nucleus, the whole has formed.\"    \"My sister is unwell.\"    \"Ah, and that's all. It really is too bad, now.\"    \"We had a visitor last night.\"    \"A thief, I suppose?\"    \"Yes, yes--I believe a thief. I do believe it was a thief, and she was  terrified.\"    \"Of course, and upon such a thing is grafted a story of a vampyre, and  the marks of his teeth being in her neck, and all the circumstantial  particulars.\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"Good morning, Mr. Bannerworth.\"    Henry bade the gentleman good morning, and much vexed at the publicity  which the affair had already obtained, he set spurs to his horse,  determined that he would speak"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#7)"],[1,"stairs. I want to look up something to eat.\"    \"Thank you,\" said the burglar, \"it would be a good idea.\"    \"You need not thank me,\" said Geoffrey. \"I don't take you with me for  the pleasure of your company, but because I don't dare let you out of my  sight.\"    McVay, as was his habit when anything unpleasant was said, chose to  ignore this speech.    \"You know,\" he said, as they went down stairs, \"I suppose that most men  shut up in a closet for all those hours would take it as a hardship,  but, to me it was a positive rest. I really in a way enjoyed it. It is  one of my theories that every one ought to have resources within. Now I  dare say you were quite anxious about me.\"    \"I never thought of you at all,\" said Geoffrey. \"After I got in I went  to sleep for three hours.\"    McVay looked at him once or twice, in surprise. Then he said with  dignity: \"Asleep? Well, really, Holland, I don't think that was very  considerate.\"    \"Don't talk so loud,\" said Geoffrey, \"you'll wake your sister.\"    Geoffrey had always been in the habit of going on shooting trips at  short notice, and so it was his rule to keep a supply of canned eatables  in the house to be ready whenever the whim took him. On these he now  depended, and was not a little annoyed to find the kitchen store room  where they were kept securely locked.    This difficulty, however, McVay made light of. He asked for his tools  and on being given them set to work on the door.    \"Have you ever noticed,\" he said, \"the heavy handed way in which some  men use tools? Look at my touch,--so light, yet so accurate. I take no  credit to myself. I was born so. It's a very fortunate thing to be  naturally dexterous.\"    \"It would have been more fortunate for you if you had been a little less  so.\"    \"Oh, I don't know about that, Holland. I might have starved to death  years ago.\"    \"I wish to God you had,\" said Geoffrey.    McVay shook his head faintly in deprecation of such violence, but  otherwise preferred to pass the remark by, and they soon set to work  heating soup and smoked beef. When all was ready and spread in the  dining-room--this was McVay's suggestion; he said food was unappetising  unless it were nicely served--Geoffrey said:    \"Go and see if your sister is awake, and if she is,\" he added firmly,  \"I'll give you a few minutes alone with her, so that you can explain the  situation fully.\"    McVay nodded and slipped into the library. Geoffrey shut the door behind  him, and sat down on a bench in the hall from which he could command  both doors.    If he entertained the doubts of her innocence which he continually told  himself no sane man could help entertaining, he found himself strangely  nervous. He felt as if he were waiting outside an operating room. He  thought of her as he had seen her asleep, of the curve of her eye-lashes  on her cheek, of her raising those lashes, awaking to be met with  McVay's revelations. Even if she were guilty, Geoffrey found it in his  heart to pity her waking to learn that her brother was a prisoner. How  unfortunate, too, would be her own position,--the guest, if only for a  few hours, of a man who was concerned only to lodge her brother in jail.    His heart gave a distinct thump when the library door opened and they  came out together. His eyes turned to her face at once, and found it  unperturbed. Didn't she care, or had she always known?    McVay caught his arm when she had passed them by, and whispered glibly:    \"Thought it was better to wait until she had had something to eat--shock  on an empty stomach, so bad--so hard to bear.\"    Geoffrey shook his arm free. \"You infernal coward,\" he whispered back.    \"Well, I like that,\" retorted McVay, \"you didn't tell her yourself when  you had the chance.\"    \"It wasn't my affair. I did not tell her because--\"    \"Oh, I know,\" McVay interrupted with a chuckle. \"I've been knowing why  for the last ten minutes.\"    They followed her into the dining-room.    It was not a sumptuous repast to which they sat down, but Geoffrey asked  nothing better. He was sitting opposite to her,--a position evidently  decreed him by Fate from the beginning of time. He could look at her,  and now and then, in spite of her delicious reluctance, could force her  to meet his eyes. When this happened, nothing was ever more apparent  than that, for both of them, a momentous event had occurred.    She was almost completely silent, and as for him, his responses to the  general conversation which McVay kept attempting to set up, were so  entirely mechanical that he was scarcely aware of them himself.    It was she who suddenly remembered that it was Christmas day.    \"And _this_ is our Christmas dinner,\" observed McVay regretfully.    \"Oh, no,\" returned the girl, \"this is luncheon. I'll cook your dinner.  You'll see.\"    There was a pause. Geoffrey looked at McVay. The moment for  disillusioning her had manifestly come. Wherever they might next meet it  would not be at his dinner table. A hateful vision of a criminal court  rose before him.    \"Miss McVay,\" he said gravely, indifferent to the signals of warning  which the other man was directing toward him; \"we shall not be here at  dinner. Your brother will tell you my reasons for wishing to start down  the mountain.\"    \"Now?\"    \"At once.\"    She coloured slowly and deeply,--the only evidence of anger. \"I do not  need any other reason than your wish that we should go,\" she said,  rising. \"I should thank you for having borne with us so long.\"    \"Upon my word, Holland, it is madness to start as late as this,\" said  McVay. \"It will be dark in an hour.\"    She turned on her brother quickly: \"Please say no more about the matter,  Billy,\" she said. \"We will start at once.\"    \"You won't start if it means certainly freezing to death,\" he  remonstrated.    She flashed a glance at Geoffrey, who had also risen and was trying to  compel the truth from McVay by a stern, steady glance.    \"I _would_,\" she answered and shut the door behind her.    McVay sprang up and was about to follow her when Geoffrey stopped him.  \"One moment,\" he said, \"you are quite right. It is too late to start  to-night. We must stay here until to-morrow. But if we are to spend a  night here without your sister's being told--\"    \"My dear Holland, think of her position, if we did tell her!\"    \"I grant that the information had better be withheld until just as we  are starting, but in that case I must--\"    \"I know what you are going to ask,--my word of honour not to escape. I  give it, I give it willingly.\"    \"I'm not going to ask for anything at all,\" said Geoffrey. \"I'm going to  tell you one or two things, and I advise you to pay attention. We won't  have any nonsense at all. Remember I am armed, and I am a quick man with  a gun. There may be some quicker, but not in the East, and it wasn't in  the East I got my training. You will always keep in front of me where I  can see you plainly, and you will never, under any circumstances come  nearer than six feet to me. If you should ever come nearer than that or  take a sudden step in my direction, I'd shoot you just as sure as I  stand here.\"    McVay looked distinctly crestfallen. \"Oh, come, Holland,\" he said,  \"isn't that the least little bit exaggerated? You would not shoot me  before my own sister?\"    \"I would not like to, but there are things I should dislike even more,  and having you escape is one of them.\"    The other thought it over. \"The trouble is,\" he explained, \"that I am  impulsive. You must have noticed it. I get carried away. You know how I  am. I'm not at all sure that I shall remember.\"    \"I advise you to try, for this is the only warning you will get.\"    \"I cannot believe, Holland, that you would really shoot me in cold blood  in the presence of my own sister.\"    \"You had better behave as if you believed it.\"    \"I don't like this arrangement,\" McVay broke out peevishly. \"Suppose,  for the sake of argument, that I did forget,--that I put my hand on your  shoulder--a very natural gesture.\"    \"I should shoot instantly.\"    \"But fancy the shock to Cecilia.\"    \"Not more of a shock, perhaps, than discovering that you are a thief.  And another thing, it may be very gay and amusing to be forever fooling  about the subject, but I advise you against it. It does not amuse me.\"    \"Oh, be honest, Holland, it does, it must amuse you. It is essentially  amusing.\"    \"It won't amuse her, or you either when she finds out that you are not  only a thief but that you have been able to find amusement in deceiving  her.\"    Again McVay's gaiety seemed momentarily dashed. \"Very true,\" he said, \"I  had not thought of that. But then,\" he added more brightly, \"who can  tell if it will actually fall to my lot to tell her. Things happen so  strangely. It may turn out that that is _your_ part.\"    \"It may,\" said Geoffrey, \"but only because I have had to shoot after  all.\" With which he opened the door and they returned to the library.          V      Cecilia was not in the library, and McVay, without comment on her  absence, turned at once to his book.    \"If you won't think me impolite, Holland, I'll go on with my Sterne.  Conversation is always a great temptation to me, but I have so little  opportunity to read that I feel I ought not to neglect it,--especially  as your books are so unusual.\"    He settled himself to Tristram Shandy with appreciation, but Geoffrey  could not read. He sat, indeed, with a book open on his knee, but his  eyes were fixed on the carpet. The knowledge of the girl's presence in  his house distracted him like a lantern swung before his eyes. He gave  himself up to steeping himself in his emotion, which, in some  situations, is the nearest thing possible to thinking.    Geoffrey's success with women had been conspicuous, as was natural for  he was good looking, rich and apparently susceptible. As a matter of  fact, however, his susceptibility was purely superficial, and for this  very reason he"]]]
