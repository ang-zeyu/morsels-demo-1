And I know they will want to if they see  her.\" She squeezed the bundle closer with the prescient pang of parting.    \"Maybe they'll be out somewhere.\" With this faint hope she reached the  tenement and crept up the dingy stairs. She peeped in at the door. Alas!  Her uncle and aunt were in the kitchen, through which she had to pass. They  had company; some dirty-looking men and women, and there were a jug and  glasses on the table before them. Mary's heart sank, but she nodded bravely  to the company and tried to slip through the crowd to the other room. But  her aunt was quick to see that she carried something under her coat.    \"What you got there? A Christmas present?\" she sneered.    Mary flushed. \"No,\" she said slowly, \"just something I found.\"    \"Found? Hello, what is it? A package!\"    Her uncle advanced and snatched it from her.    \"Please,\" pleaded Mary, \"please, I found it. It is mine. I think it is only  a doll.\"    \"A doll! Huh! Who needs a doll?\" hiccoughed her uncle. \"We want something  more to drink. We'll sell it--\"    A bellow of laughter resounded through the room. The paper being torn  roughly away, poor Miranda stood revealed in all her faded beauty. The  pallid waxen face, straggling hair, and old-fashioned dress presented a  sorry sight to the greedy eyes which had expected to find something  exchangeable for drink. A sorry sight she was to Mary, who had hoped for  something so much lovelier. A flush of disappointment came into her cheek,  and tears to her eyes.    \"Here, take your old doll,\" said her uncle roughly, thrusting it into her  arms. \"Take your old doll and get away with her. If that's the best you can  find you'd better _steal_ something next time.\"    Steal something! Had she not in fact stolen it? Mary knew very well that  she had, and she flushed pinker yet to think what a fool she had made of  herself for nothing. She took the despised doll and retreated into the  other room, followed by a chorus of jeers and comments. She banged the door  behind her and sat down with poor Miranda on her knees, crying as if her  heart would break. She had so longed for a beautiful doll! It did seem too  cruel that when she found one it should turn out to be so ugly. She seized  poor Miranda and shook her fiercely.    \"You horrid old thing!\" she said. \"Ain't you ashamed to fool me so? Ain't  you ashamed to make me think you was a lovely doll with pretty clo'es and  _white kid shoes?_ Ain't you?\"    She shook Miranda again until her eyeballs rattled in her head. The doll  fell to the floor and lay there with closed eyes. Her face was pallid and  ghastly. Her bonnet had fallen off, and her hair stuck out wildly in every  direction. Her legs were doubled under her in the most helpless fashion.  She was the forlornest figure of a doll imaginable. Presently Mary drew her  hands away from her eyes and looked down at Miranda. There was something in  the doll's attitude as she lay there which touched the little girl's heart.  Once she had seen a woman who had been injured in the street,--she would  never forget it. The poor creature's eyes had been closed, and her face,  under the fallen bonnet, was of this same pasty color. Mary shuddered.  Suddenly she felt a warm rush of pity for the doll.    \"You poor old thing!\" she exclaimed, looking at Miranda almost tenderly.  \"I'm sorry I shook you. You look so tired and sad and homesick! I wonder if  somebody is worrying about you this minute. It was very wicked of me to  take you away--on Christmas Eve, too! I wish I had left you where I found  you. Maybe some little girl is crying now because you are lost.\"    Mary stooped and lifted the doll gently upon her knees. As she took Miranda  up, the blue eyes opened and seemed to look full at her. Miranda's one  beauty was her eyes. Mary felt her heart grow warmer and warmer toward the  quaint stranger.    \"You have lovely eyes,\" she murmured. \"I think after all you are almost  pretty. Perhaps I should grow to like you awfully. You are not a bit like  the doll I hoped to have; but that is not your fault.\" A thought made her  face brighten. \"Why, if you had been a beautiful doll they would have taken  you away and sold you for rum.\" Her face expressed utter disgust. She  hugged Miranda close with a sudden outburst of affection. \"Oh, you dear old  thing!\" she cried. \"I am so glad you are--just like this. I am so glad, for  now I can keep you always and always, and no one will want to take you away  from me.\"    She rocked to and fro, holding the doll tightly to her heart. Mary was not  one to feel a half-passion about anything. \"I will make you some new  dresses,\" she said, fingering the old-fashioned silk with a puzzled air. \"I  wonder why your mother dressed you so queerly? She was not much of a sewer  if she made this bonnet!\" Scornfully she took off the primitive bonnet and  smoothed out the tangled hair. \"I wonder what you have on underneath,\" she  said.    With gentle fingers she began to undress Miranda. Off came the green silk  dress with its tight \"basque\" and overskirt. Off came the ruffled petticoat  and little chemise edged with fine lace. And Miranda stood in shapeless,  kid-bodied ugliness, which stage of evolution the doll of her day had  reached.    But there was something more. Around her neck she wore a ribbon; on the  ribbon was a cardboard medal; and on the medal a childish hand had  scratched the legend,--    _Miranda Terry._  If lost, please return her to her mother,  _Angelina Terry_,  87 Overlook Terrace.    It was such a card as Miss Terry herself had worn in the days when her  mother had first let her and Tom go out on the street without a nurse.    Mary stared hard at the bit of cardboard. 87 Overlook Terrace! Yes, that  was where she had found the doll. She remembered now seeing the name on a  street corner. _Miranda;_ what a pretty name for a doll! _Angelina Terry;_  so that was the name of the little girl who had lost Miranda. Angelina  must be feeling very sorry now. Perhaps she was crying herself to sleep,  for it was growing late.    Her two girl cousins came romping into the bedroom. They had been having a  hilarious evening.    \"Hello, Mary!\" they cried. \"We heard about your great find!\"--\"Playing with  your old doll, are you? Goin' to hang up her stockin' and see if Santa  Claus will fill it?\"--\"Huh! Santa Claus won't come to _this_ house, I  guess!\"    Mary had almost forgotten that it was Christmas Eve. There had been nothing  in the house to remind her. Perhaps Angelina Terry had hung up a stocking  for Miranda at 87 Overlook Terrace. But there would be no Miranda to see it  the next morning.    Her cousins teased her for some time, while they undressed, and Mary grew  sulky. She sat in her corner and answered them shortly. But presently the  room was quiet, for the girls slept easily. Then Mary crept into her little  cot with the doll in her arms. She loved Miranda so much that she would  never part with her, no indeed; not even though she now knew where Miranda  belonged. 87 Overlook Terrace! The figures danced before her eyes  maliciously. She wished she could forget them. And the thought of Angelina  Terry kept coming to her. Poor Angelina!    \"She ain't 'poor Angelina,'\" argued Mary to herself. \"She's _rich_  Angelina. Doesn't she live in a big house in the swell part of the city? I  s'pose she has hundreds of dolls, much handsomer than Miranda, and lots of  other toys. I guess she won't miss this one queer old doll. I guess she'd  let me keep it if she knew I hadn't any of my own. I guess it ought to be  my doll. Anyway, I'm going to keep her. I don't believe Angelina loves  Miranda so much as I do.\"    She laid her cheek against the doll's cold waxen one and presently fell  asleep.    But she slept uneasily. In the middle of the night she awoke and lay for  hours tossing and unhappy in the stuffy little room. The clock struck one,  two, three. At last she gave a great sigh, and cuddling Miranda in her arms  turned over, with peace in her heart.    \"I will play you are mine, my very own dollie, for just this one night,\"  she whispered in Miranda's ear. \"To-morrow will be Christmas Day, and I  will take you back to your little mother, Angelina Terry. I can't do a mean  thing at Christmas time,--not even for you, dear Miranda.\"    Thereupon she fell into a peaceful sleep.          CHAPTER XII    THE ANGEL AGAIN      \"Will she bring it back?\" asked Miss Terry eagerly, when once more she  found herself under the gaze of the Christmas Angel. He nodded brightly.    \"To-morrow morning you will see,\" he said. \"It will prove that all I have  shown you is really true.\"    \"A pretty child,\" said Miss Terry musingly. \"A very nice child indeed. I  believe she looks very much as I used to be myself.\"    \"You see, she is not a thief, after all; not _yet_,\" said the Angel. \"What  a pity that she must live in that sad home, with such terrible people! A  sensitive child like her, craving sympathy and affection,--what chance has  she for happiness? What would you yourself have been in surroundings like  hers?\"    \"Yes, she is very like what I was. Of course I shall let her keep the  doll.\"    Miss Terry hesitated. The Angel looked at her steadily and his glance  seemed to read her half-formed thoughts.    \"Surely,\" he said. \"It seems to belong to her, does it not? But is this  all? I wonder if something more does not belong to her.\"    \"What more?\" asked Miss Terry shortly.    \"A home!\" cried the Angel.    Miss Terry groped in her memory for a scornful ejaculation which she had  once been fond of using, but there was no such word to be found. Instead  there came to her lips the name, \"Mary.\"    The Angel repeated it softly. \"_Mary._ It is a blessed name,\" he said.  \"Blessed the roof that shelters a Mary in her need.\"    There was a long silence, in which Miss Terry felt new impulses stirring  within her; impulses drawing her to the child whose"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#7)"],[1,"of the anniversary of an  event, the election or appointment of a person to a position, an unusual  occupation, an odd accident, an auction, a proposed municipal  improvement, the arrival of a well-known person, an official report, a  legal decision, an epidemic, the arrest of a noted criminal, the passing  of an old custom, the publication of the city directory, a railroad  accident, a marked change in fashion in dress.    A third source of both subjects and material is the report of special  studies in some field, the form of the report ranging from a paper read  at a meeting to a treatise in several volumes. These reports of  experiments, surveys, investigations, and other forms of research, are  to be found in printed bulletins, monographs, proceedings of  organizations, scientific periodicals, and new books. Government  publications--federal, state, and local--giving results of investigative  work done by bureaus, commissions, and committees, are public documents  that may usually be had free of charge. Technical and scientific  periodicals and printed proceedings of important organizations are  generally available at public libraries.    As Mr. Waldemar Kaempffert, editor of _Popular Science Monthly,_ has  said:        There is hardly a paper read before the Royal Institution or the      French Academy or our American engineering and chemical societies      that cannot be made dramatically interesting from a human standpoint      and that does not chronicle real news.    \"If you want to publish something where it will never be read,\" a wit  has observed, \"print it in an official document.\" Government reports are  filled with valuable information that remains quite unknown to the  average reader unless newspapers and magazines unearth it and present it  in popular form. The popularization of the contents of all kinds of  scientific and technical publications affords great opportunities for  the writer who can present such subjects effectively.    In addressing students of journalism on \"Science and Journalism,\" Dr.  Edwin E. Slosson, literary editor of the _Independent_, who was formerly  a professor of chemistry, has said:        The most radical ideas of our day are not apt to be found in the      popular newspaper or in queer little insurrectionary, heretical and      propaganda sheets that we occasionally see, but in the technical      journals and proceedings of learned societies. The real revolutions      are hatched in the laboratory and study. The papers read before the      annual meetings of the scientific societies, and for the most part      unnoticed by the press, contain more dynamite than was ever      discovered in any anarchist's shop. Political revolutions merely      change the form of government or the name of the party in power.      Scientific revolutions really turn the world over, and it never      settles back into its former position.           *       *       *       *       *        The beauty and meaning of scientific discoveries can be revealed to      the general reader if there is an intermediary who can understand      equally the language of the laboratory and of the street. The modern      journalist knows that anything can be made interesting to anybody,      if he takes pains enough with the writing of it. It is not      necessary, either, to pervert scientific truths in the process of      translation into the vernacular. The facts are sensational enough      without any picturesque exaggeration.           *       *       *       *       *        The field is not an unprofitable one even in the mercenary sense. To      higher motives the task of popularizing science makes a still      stronger appeal. Ignorance is the source of most of our ills.      Ignorant we must always be of much that we need to know, but there      is no excuse for remaining ignorant of what somebody on earth knows      or has known. Rich treasure lies hidden in what President Gilman      called \"the bibliothecal cairn\" of scientific monographs which piles      up about a university. The journalist might well exchange the      muckrake for the pick and dig it out.        Nothing could accelerate human progress more than to reduce the time      between the discovery of a new truth and its application to the      needs of mankind.... It is regarded as a great journalistic      achievement when the time of transmission of a cablegram is      shortened. But how much more important it is to gain a few years in      learning what the men who are in advance of their age are doing than      to gain a few seconds in learning what the people of Europe are      doing? This lag in intellectual progress ... is something which it      is the especial duty of the journalist to remove. He likes to score      a beat of a few hours. Very well, if he will turn his attention to      science, he can often score a beat of ten years.    The three main sources, therefore, of subjects and material for special  feature and magazine articles are (1) personal observation and  experience, (2) newspapers, (3) scientific and technical publications  and official reports.    PERSONAL OBSERVATION. How a writer may discover subjects for newspaper  feature articles in the course of his daily routine by being alive to  the possibilities around him can best be shown by concrete examples.    A \"community sing\" in a public park gave a woman writer a good subject  for a special article published in the _Philadelphia North American_.    In the publication of a city directory was found a timely subject for an  article on the task of getting out the annual directory in a large city;  the story was printed in a Sunday issue of the _Boston Herald_.    A glimpse of some children dressed like Arctic explorers in an outdoor  school in Kansas City was evidently the origin of a special feature  story on that institution, which was published in the _Kansas City  Star_.    A woman standing guard one evening over a partially completed school  building in Seattle suggested a special feature in the _Seattle Post  Intelligencer_ on the unusual occupation of night \"watchman\" for a  woman.    While making a purchase in a drug store, a writer overheard a clerk make  a request for a deposit from a woman who desired to have a prescription  filled, an incident which led him to write a special feature for the  _New York Times_ on this method of discouraging persons from adding to  the drug store's \"morgue\" of unclaimed prescriptions.    From a visit to the Children's Museum in Brooklyn was developed a  feature article for the _New York Herald_, and from a story-telling hour  at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was evolved a feature story for the  _Boston Herald_ on the telling of stories as a means of interesting  children in pictures.    Magazine articles also may originate in the writer's observation of what  is going on about him. The specific instances given below, like those  already mentioned, will indicate to the inexperienced writer where to  look for inspiration.    A newspaper reporter who covered the criminal courts compiled the  various methods of burglars and sneak thieves in gaining entrance to  houses and apartments, as he heard them related in trials, and wrote a  helpful article for _Good Housekeeping_ on how to protect one's house  against robbery.    The exhibition of a novel type of rack for curing seed corn gave a  writer a subject for an article on this \"corn tree,\" which was published  in the _Illustrated World_.    During a short stop at a farm while on an automobile trip, a woman  writer noticed a concrete storage cellar for vegetables, and from an  interview with the farmer obtained enough material for an article, which  she sold to a farm journal.    While a woman writer was making a purchase in a plumber's shop, the  plumber was called to the telephone. On returning to his customer, he  remarked that the call was from a woman on a farm five miles from town,  who could easily have made the slight repairs herself if she had known a  little about the water-supply system on her farm. From the material  which the writer obtained from the plumber, she wrote an article for an  agricultural paper on how plumber's bills can be avoided.    A display of canned goods in a grocer's window, with special prices for  dozen and case lots, suggested an article, afterwards published in the  _Merchants Trade Journal_, on this grocer's method of fighting  mail-order competition.    PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. What we actually do ourselves, as well as what we  see others do, may be turned to good use in writing articles. Personal  experiences not only afford good subjects and plenty of material but are  more easily handled than most other subjects, because, being very real  and vital to the writer, they can the more readily be made real and  vital to the reader. Many inexperienced writers overlook the  possibilities of what they themselves have done and are doing.    To gain experience and impressions for their articles, special writers  on newspapers even assume temporarily the roles of persons whose lives  and experiences they desire to portray. One Chicago paper featured every  Sunday for many weeks articles by a reporter who, in order to get  material, did a variety of things just for one day, from playing in a  strolling street band to impersonating a convict in the state  penitentiary. Thirty years ago, when women first entered the newspaper  field as special feature writers, they were sometimes sent out on  \"freak\" assignments for special features, such as feigning injury or  insanity in order to gain entrance to hospitals in the guise of  patients. Recently one woman writer posed as an applicant for a position  as moving-picture actress; another applied for a place as housemaid; a  third donned overalls and sorted scrap-iron all day in the yard of a  factory; and still another accompanied a store detective on his rounds  in order to discover"]]]
