[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#7)"],[1," Not many knew it, for where  the form of business is blackmail the fewer creditors you have the  better (which of course in various degrees applies at all times).    On the shores of the risky seas of Shiroora Shan grows one tree only  so that upon its branches if anywhere in the world there must build  its nest the Bird of the Difficult Eye. Neepy Thang had come by this  information, which was indeed the truth, that if the bird migrated to  Fairyland before the three eggs hatched out they would undoubtedly all  turn into emeralds, while if they hatched out first it would be a bad  business.    When he had mentioned these eggs to Messrs. Grosvenor and Campbell  they had said, \"The very thing\": they were men of few words, in  English, for it was not their native tongue.    So Neepy Thang set out. He bought the purple ticket at Victoria  Station. He went by Herne Hill, Bromley and Bickley and passed St.  Mary Cray. At Eynsford he changed and taking a footpath along a  winding valley went wandering into the hills. And at the top of a hill  in a little wood, where all the anemones long since were over and the  perfume of mint and thyme from outside came drifting in with Thang, he  found once more the familiar path, age-old and fair as wonder, that  leads to the Edge of the World. Little to him were its sacred memories  that are one with the secret of earth, for he was on business, and  little would they be to me if I ever put them on paper. Let it suffice  that he went down that path going further and further from the fields  we know, and all the way he muttered to himself, \"What if the eggs  hatch out and it be a bad business!\" The glamour that is at all times  upon those lonely lands that lie at the back of the chalky hills of  Kent intensified as he went upon his journeys. Queerer and queerer  grew the things that he saw by little World-End Path. Many a twilight  descended upon that journey with all their mysteries, many a blaze of  stars; many a morning came flaming up to a tinkle of silvern horns;  till the outpost elves of Fairyland came in sight and the glittering  crests of Fairyland's three mountains betokened the journey's end. And  so with painful steps (for the shores of the world are covered with  huge crystals) he came to the risky seas of Shiroora Shan and saw them  pounding to gravel the wreckage of fallen stars, saw them and heard  their roar, those shipless seas that between earth and the fairies'  homes heave beneath some huge wind that is none of our four. And there  in the darkness on the grizzly coast, for darkness was swooping  slantwise down the sky as though with some evil purpose, there stood  that lonely, gnarled and deciduous tree. It was a bad place to be  found in after dark, and night descended with multitudes of stars,  beasts prowling in the blackness gluttered [See any dictionary, but in  vain.] at Neepy Thang. And there on a lower branch within easy reach  he clearly saw the Bird of the Difficult Eye sitting upon the nest for  which she is famous. Her face was towards those three inscrutable  mountains, far-off on the other side of the risky seas, whose hidden  valleys are Fairyland. Though not yet autumn in the fields we know, it  was close on midwinter here, the moment as Thang knew when those eggs  hatch out. Had he miscalculated and arrived a minute too late? Yet the  bird was even now about to migrate, her pinions fluttered and her gaze  was toward Fairyland. Thang hoped and muttered a prayer to those pagan  gods whose spite and vengeance he had most reason to fear. It seems  that it was too late or a prayer too small to placate them, for there  and then the stroke of midwinter came and the eggs hatched out in the  roar of Shiroora Shan or ever the bird was gone with her difficult eye  and it was a bad business indeed for Neepy Thang; I haven't the heart  to tell you any more.    \"'Ere,\" said Lord Castlenorman some few weeks later to Messrs.  Grosvenor and Campbell, \"you aren't 'arf taking your time about those  emeralds.\"            The Long Porter's Tale    There are things that are known only to the long porter of Tong Tong  Tarrup as he sits and mumbles memories to himself in the little  bastion gateway.    He remembers the war there was in the halls of the gnomes; and how the  fairies came for the opals once, which Tong Tong Tarrup has; and the  way that the giants went through the fields below, he watching from  his gateway: he remembers quests that are even yet a wonder to the  gods. Who dwells in those frozen houses on the high bare brink of the  world not even he has told me, and he is held to be garrulous. Among  the elves, the only living things ever seen moving at that awful  altitude where they quarry turquoise on Earth's highest crag, his name  is a byword for loquacity wherewith they mock the talkative.    His favourite story if you offer him bash--the drug of which he is  fondest, and for which he will give his service in war to the elves  against the goblins, or vice-versa if the goblins bring him more--his  favourite story, when bodily soothed by the drug and mentally fiercely  excited, tells of a quest undertaken ever so long ago for nothing more  marketable than an old woman's song.    Picture him telling it. An old man, lean and bearded, and almost  monstrously long, that lolled in a city's gateway on a crag perhaps  ten miles high; the houses for the most part facing eastward, lit by  the sun and moon and the constellations we know, but one house on the  pinnacle looking over the edge of the world and lit by the glimmer of  those unearthly spaces where one long evening wears away the stars: my  little offering of bash; a long forefinger that nipped it at once on a  stained and greedy thumb--all these are in the foreground of the  picture. In the background, the mystery of those silent houses and of  not knowing who their denizens were, or what service they had at the  hands of the long porter and what payment he had in return, and  whether he was mortal.    Picture him in the gateway of this incredible town, having swallowed  my bash in silence, stretch his great length, lean back, and begin to  speak.    It seems that one clear morning a hundred years ago, a visitor to Tong  Tong Tarrup was climbing up from the world. He had already passed  above the snow and had set his foot on a step of the earthward  stairway that goes down from Tong Tong Tarrup on to the rocks, when  the long porter saw him. And so painfully did he climb those easy  steps that the grizzled man on watch had long to wonder whether or not  the stranger brought him bash, the drug that gives a meaning to the  stars and seems to explain the twilight. And in the end there was not  a scrap of bash, and the stranger had nothing better to offer that  grizzled man than his mere story only.    It seems that the stranger's name was Gerald Jones, and he always  lived in London; but once as a child he had been on a Northern moor.  It was so long ago that he did not remember how, only somehow or other  he walked alone on the moor, and all the ling was in flower. There was  nothing in sight but ling and heather and bracken, except, far off  near the sunset, on indistinct hills, there were little vague patches  that looked like the fields of men. With evening a mist crept up and  hid the hills, and still he went walking on over the moor. And then he  came to the valley, a tiny valley in the midst of the moor, whose  sides were incredibly steep. He lay down and looked at it through the  roots of the ling. And a long, long way below him, in a garden by a  cottage, with hollyhocks all round her that were taller than herself,  there sat an old woman on a wooden chair, singing in the evening. And  the man had taken a fancy to the song and remembered it after in  London, and whenever it came to his mind it made him think of  evenings--the kind you don't get in London--and he heard a soft wind  going idly over the moor and the bumble-bees in a hurry, and forgot  the noise of the traffic. And always, whenever he heard men speak of  Time, he grudged to Time most this song. Once afterwards he went to  that Northern moor again and found the tiny valley, but there was no  old woman in the garden, and no one was singing a song. And either  regret for the song that the old woman had sung, on a summer evening  twenty years away and daily receding, troubled his mind, or else the  wearisome work that he did in London, for he worked for a great firm  that was perfectly useless; and he grew old early, as men do in  cities. And at last, when melancholy brought only regret and the  uselessness of his work gained round him with age, he decided to  consult a magician. So to a magician he went and told him his  troubles, and particularly he told him how he had heard the song. \"And  now,\" he said, \"it is nowhere in the world.\"    \"Of course it is not in the world,\" the magician said, \"but over the  Edge of the World you may easily find it.\" And he told the man that he  was suffering from flux of time and recommended a day at the Edge of  the World. Jones asked what part of the Edge of the World he should go  to, and the magician had heard Tong Tong Tarrup well spoken of; so he  paid him, as is usual, in opals, and started at once on the journey.  The ways to that town are winding; he took the ticket at Victoria  Station that they only give if they know you: he went past Bleth: he  went along the Hills of Neol-Hungar and came to the Gap of Poy. All  these are in that part of the world that pertains to the fields we  know; but beyond the Gap of Poy on those ordinary plains, that so  closely resemble Sussex, one first meets the unlikely. A line of  common grey hills, the Hills of Sneg, may be seen at the edge of the  plain from the Gap of Poy; it is there that the incredible begins,  infrequently at first, but happening more and more as you go up the  hills. For instance, descending once into Poy Plains, the first thing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#7)"],[1,"   This external view and this method of interpretation are, therefore,  fundamentally erroneous. Never, perhaps, has the progress of a nation  been so manifestly an evolution as distinguished from a revolution. No  foreign conquerors have come in with their armies, crushing down the  old and building up a new civilization. No magician's wand has been  waved over the land to make the people forget the traditions of a  thousand years and fall in with those of the new regime. No rite or  incantation has been performed to charm the marvelous tree of  civilization and cause it to take root and grow to such lofty  proportions in an unprepared soil.    In contrast to the defective views outlined above, one need not  hesitate to believe that the actual process by which Old Japan has  been transformed into New Japan is perfectly natural and necessary. It  has been a continuous growth; it is not the mere accumulation of  external additions; it does not consist alone of the acquisition of  the machinery and the institutions of the Occident. It is rather a  development from within, based upon already existing ideas and  institutions. New Japan is the consequence of her old endowment and  her new environment. Her evolution has been in progress and can be  traced for at least a millennium and a half, during which she has been  preparing for this latest step. All that was necessary for its  accomplishment was the new environment. The correctness of this view  and the reasons for it will appear as we proceed in our study of  Japanese characteristics. But we need to note at this point the  danger, into which many fall, of ascribing to Japan an attainment of  western civilization which the facts will not warrant. She has  secured much, but by no means all, that the West has to give.    We may suggest our line of thought by asking what is the fundamental  element of civilization? Does it consist in the manifold appliances  that render life luxurious; the railroad, the telegraph, the post  office, the manufactures, the infinite variety of mechanical and other  conveniences? Or is it not rather the social and intellectual and  ethical state of a people? Manifestly the latter. The tools indeed of  civilization may be imported into a half-civilized, or barbarous  country; such importation, however, does not render the country  civilized, although it may assist greatly in the attainment of that  result. Civilization being mental, social, and ethical, can arise only  through the growth of the mind and character of the vast multitudes of  a nation. Now has Japan imported only the tools of civilization? In  other words, is her new civilization only external, formal, nominal,  unreal? That she has imported much is true. Yet that her attainments  and progress rest on her social, intellectual, and ethical development  will become increasingly clear as we take up our successive chapters.  Under the new environment of the past fifty years, this growth,  particularly in intellectual, in industrial, and in political lines,  has been exceedingly rapid as compared with the growths of other  peoples.    This conception of the rise of New Japan will doubtless approve itself  to every educated man who will allow his thought to rest upon the  subject. For all human progress, all organic evolution, proceeds by  the progressive modification of the old organs under new conditions.  The modern locomotive did not spring complete from the mind of James  Watt; it is the result of thousands of years of human experience and  consequent evolution, beginning first perhaps with a rolling log,  becoming a rude cart, and being gradually transformed by successive  inventions until it has become one of the marvels of the nineteenth  century. It is impossible for those who have attained the view-point  of modern science to conceive of discontinuous progress; of  continually rising types of being, of thought, or of moral life, in  which the higher does not find its ground and root and thus an  important part of its explanation, in the lower. Such is the case not  only with reference: to biological evolution; it is especially true of  social evolution. He who would understand the Japan of to-day cannot  rest with the bare statement that her adoption of the tools and  materials of Western civilization has given her her present power and  place among the nations. The student with historical insight knows  that it is impossible for one nation, off-hand, without preparation,  to \"adopt the civilization\" of another.    The study of the evolution of Japan is one of unusual interest; first,  because of the fact that Japan has experienced such unique changes in  her environment. Her history brings into clear light some principles  of evolution which the visual development of a people does not make so  clear.    In the second place, New Japan is in a state of rapid growth. She is  in a critical period, resembling a youth, just coming to manhood, when  all the powers of growth are most vigorous. The latent qualities of  body and mind and heart then burst forth with peculiar force. In the  course of four or five short years the green boy develops into a  refined and noble man; the thoughtless girl ripens into the full  maturity of womanhood and of motherhood. These are the years of  special interest to those who would observe nature in her time of most  critical activity.    Not otherwise is it in the life of nations. There are times when their  growth is phenomenally rapid; when their latent qualities are  developed; when their growth can be watched with special ease and  delight, because so rapid. The Renaissance was such a period in  Europe. Modern art, science, and philosophy took their start with the  awakening of the mind of Europe at that eventful and epochal period of  her life. Such, I take it, is the condition of Japan to-day. She is  \"being born again\"; undergoing her \"renaissance.\" Her intellect,  hitherto largely dormant, is but now awaking. Her ambition is equaled  only by her self-reliance. Her self-confidence and amazing  expectations have not yet been sobered by hard experience. Neither  does she, nor do her critics, know how much she can or cannot do. She  is in the first flush of her new-found powers; powers of mind and  spirit, as well as of physical force. Her dreams are gorgeous with all  the colors of the rainbow. Her efforts are sure, to be noble in  proportion as her ambitions are high. The growth of the past  half-century is only the beginning of what we may expect to see.    Then again, this latest and greatest step in the evolution of Japan  has taken place at a time unparalleled for opportunities of  observation, under the incandescent light of the nineteenth century,  with its thousands of educated men to observe and record the facts,  many of whom are active agents in the evolution in progress. Hundreds  of papers and magazines, native and European, read by tens of  thousands of intelligent men and women, have kept the world aware of  the daily and hourly events. Telegraphic dispatches and letters by the  million have passed between the far East and the West. It would seem  as if the modernizing of Japan had been providentially delayed until  the last half of the nineteenth century with its steam and  electricity, annihilators of space and time, in order that her  evolution might be studied with a minuteness impossible in any  previous age, or by any previous generation. It is almost as if one  were conducting an experiment in human evolution in his own  laboratory, imposing the conditions and noting the results.    For still another reason is the evolution of New Japan of special  interest to all intelligent persons. To illustrate great things by  small, and human by physical, no one who has visited Geneva has failed  to see the beautiful mingling of the Arve and the Rhone. The latter  flowing from the calm Geneva lake is of delicate blue, pure and  limpid. The former, running direct from the glaciers of Mont Blanc and  the roaring bed of Chamouni, bears along in its rushing waters  powdered rocks and loosened soil. These rivers, though joined in one  bed, for hundreds of rods are quite distinct; the one, turbid; the  other, clear as crystal; yet they press each against the other, now a  little of the Rhone's clear current forces its way into the Arve, soon  to be carried off, absorbed and discolored by the mass of muddy water  around it. Now a little of the turbid Arve forces its way into the  clear blue Rhone, to lose there its identity in the surrounding  waters. The interchange goes on, increasing with the distance until,  miles below, the two-rivers mingle as one. No longer is it the Arve or  the old Rhone, but the new Rhone.    In Japan there is going on to-day a process unique in the history of  the human race. Two streams of civilization, that of the far East and  that of the far West, are beginning to flow in a single channel. These  streams are exceedingly diverse, in social structure, in government,  in moral ideals and standards, in religion, in psychological and  metaphysical conceptions. Can they live together? Or is one going to  drive out and annihilate the other? If so, which will be victor? Or is  there to be modification of both? In other words, is there to be a new  civilization--a Japanese, an Occidento-Oriental civilization?    The answer is plain to him who has eyes with which to see. Can the  Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? No more can Japan  lose all trace of inherited customs of daily life, of habits of  thought and language, products of a thousand years of training in  Chinese literature, Buddhist doctrine, and Confucian ethics. That \"the  boy is father to the man\" is true of a nation no less than of an  individual. What a youth has been at home in his habits of thought, in  his purpose and spirit and in their manifestation in action, will  largely determine his after-life. In like manner the"]]]
