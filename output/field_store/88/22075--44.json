In 1596 he was made a Queen's  Counsel, but missed the appointment of Master of the Rolls, and in the  next year (1597), he _pub._ the first edition of his _Essays_, ten in  number, combined with _Sacred Meditations_ and the _Colours of Good and  Evil_. By 1601 Essex had lost the Queen's favour, and had raised his  rebellion, and B. was one of those appointed to investigate the charges  against him, and examine witnesses, in connection with which he showed an  ungrateful and indecent eagerness in pressing the case against his former  friend and benefactor, who was executed on Feb. 25, 1601. This act B.  endeavoured to justify in _A Declaration of the Practices and Treasons,  etc., of ... the Earl of Essex, etc._ His circumstances had for some time  been bad, and he had been arrested for debt: he had, however, received a  gift of a fine of L1200 on one of Essex's accomplices. The accession of  James VI. in 1603 gave a favourable turn to his fortunes: he was  knighted, and endeavoured to set himself right with the new powers by  writing his _Apologie_ (defence) of his proceedings in the case of Essex,  who had favoured the succession of James. In the first Parliament of the  new king he sat for St. Alban's, and was appointed a Commissioner for  Union with Scotland. In 1605 he _pub._ _The Advancement of Learning_,  dedicated, with fulsome flattery, to the king. The following year he  married Alice Barnham, the _dau._ of a London merchant, and in 1607 he  was made Solicitor-General, and wrote _Cogita et Visa_, a first sketch of  the _Novum Organum_, followed in 1609 by _The Wisdom of the Ancients_.  Meanwhile (in 1608), he had entered upon the Clerkship of the Star  Chamber, and was in the enjoyment of a large income; but old debts and  present extravagance kept him embarrassed, and he endeavoured to obtain  further promotion and wealth by supporting the king in his arbitrary  policy. In 1613 he became Attorney-General, and in this capacity  prosecuted Somerset in 1616. The year 1618 saw him Lord Keeper, and the  next Lord Chancellor and Baron Verulam, a title which, in 1621, he  exchanged for that of Viscount St. Albans. Meanwhile he had written the  _New Atlantis_, a political romance, and in 1620 he presented to the king  the _Novum Organum_, on which he had been engaged for 30 years, and which  ultimately formed the main part of the _Instauratio Magna_. In his great  office B. showed a failure of character in striking contrast with the  majesty of his intellect. He was corrupt alike politically and  judicially, and now the hour of retribution arrived. In 1621 a  Parliamentary Committee on the administration of the law charged him with  corruption under 23 counts; and so clear was the evidence that he made no  attempt at defence. To the lords, who sent a committee to inquire  whether the confession was really his, he replied, \"My lords, it is my  act, my hand, and my heart; I beseech your lordships to be merciful to a  broken reed.\" He was sentenced to a fine of L40,000, remitted by the  king, to be committed to the Tower during the king's pleasure (which was  that he should be released in a few days), and to be incapable of holding  office or sitting in parliament. He narrowly escaped being deprived of  his titles. Thenceforth he devoted himself to study and writing. In 1622  appeared his _History of Henry VII._, and the 3rd part of the  _Instauratio_; in 1623, _History of Life and Death_, the _De Augmentis  Scientarum_, a Latin translation of the _Advancement_, and in 1625 the  3rd edition of the _Essays_, now 58 in number. He also _pub._  _Apophthegms_, and a translation of some of the _Psalms_. His life was  now approaching its close. In March, 1626, he came to London, and shortly  after, when driving on a snowy day, the idea struck him of making an  experiment as to the antiseptic properties of snow, in consequence of  which he caught a chill, which ended in his death on 9th April 1626. He  left debts to the amount of L22,000. At the time of his death he was  engaged upon _Sylva Sylvarum_. The intellect of B. was one of the most  powerful and searching ever possessed by man, and his developments of the  inductive philosophy revolutionised the future thought of the human race.  The most popular of his works is the _Essays_, which convey profound and  condensed thought in a style that is at once clear and rich. His moral  character was singularly mixed and complex, and bears no comparison with  his intellect. It exhibits a singular coldness and lack of enthusiasm,  and indeed a bluntness of moral perception and an absence of  attractiveness rarely combined with such extraordinary mental endowments.  All that was possible to be done in defence of his character and public  conduct has been done by his accomplished biographer and editor, Mr.  Spedding (_q.v._). Singular, though of course futile, attempts, supported  sometimes with much ingenuity, have been made to claim for B. the  authorship of Shakespeare's plays, and have indeed been extended so as to  include those of Marlowe, and even the _Essays_ of Montaigne.    SUMMARY.--_B._ London 1561, _ed._ Trinity Coll., Cambridge, dissatisfied  with Aristotelean philosophy, entered Gray's Inn 1576, in France 1576-79,  called to Bar 1582, enters Parliament 1584, became friend of Essex 1591,  who presents him with estate 1593, _pub._ 1st ed. of _Essays_ 1597,  prosecutes Essex 1601, _pub._ _Advancement of Learning_ 1605,  Solicitor-Gen. 1607, _pub._ _Wisdom of the Ancients_ 1609, Attorney-Gen.  1613, prosecuted Somerset 1616, Lord Keeper 1618, Lord Chancellor with  title of Verulam 1619, Visc. St. Albans 1621, _pub._ _Novum Organum_  1620, charged with corruption, and retires from public life 1621, _pub._  _Henry VII._ and 3rd part of _Instauratio_ 1622, _d._ 1626.    The standard edition of B.'s works is that of Spedding, Ellis, and Heath  (14 vols. 1857-74), including _Life and Letters_ by Spedding. See also  Macaulay's _Essays_; Dean Church in _Men of Letters Series_; Dr. Abbott's  _Life_ (1885), etc. For philosophy Fowler's _Novum Organum_ (1878).      BACON, ROGER (1214?-1294).--Philosopher, studied at Oxford and Paris. His  scientific acquirements, regarded in that age as savouring of  witchcraft, and doubtless also his protests against the ignorance and  immorality of the clergy, excited the jealousy and hatred of the  Franciscans, and he was in consequence imprisoned at Paris for ten years.  Clement IV., who had been a sympathiser, desired on his accession to see  his works, and in response B. sent him _Opus Majus_, a treatise on the  sciences (grammar, logic, mathematics, physics, and philosophy), followed  by _Opus Secundum_ and _Opus Tertium_. Clement, however, was near death  when they arrived. B. was comparatively free from persecution for the  next ten years. But in 1278 he was again imprisoned for upwards of ten  years. At the intercession of some English noblemen he was at last  released, and spent his remaining years at Oxford. He possessed one of  the most commanding intellects of his own, or perhaps of any, age, and,  notwithstanding all the disadvantages and discouragements to which he was  subjected, made many discoveries, and came near to many more. There is  still preserved at Oxford a rectified calendar in which he approximates  closely to the truth. He received the sobriquet of the \"Doctor  Mirabilis.\"      BAGE, ROBERT (1728-1801).--Novelist, _b._ in Derbyshire, was the _s._ of  a paper-maker. It was not until he was 53 that he took to literature; but  in the 15 years following he produced 6 novels, of which Sir Walter Scott  says that \"strong mind, playful fancy, and extensive knowledge are  everywhere apparent.\" B., though brought up as a Quaker, imbibed the  principles of the French Revolution. He was an amiable and benevolent  man, and highly esteemed. _Hermsprong; or, Man as He is Not_ (1796) is  considered the best of his novels, of which it was the last. The names of  the others are _Mount Kenneth_ (1781), _Barham Downs_ (1784), _The Fair  Syrian_ (1787), _James Wallace_ (1788), and _Man as He is_ (1792).      BAGEHOT, WALTER (1826-1877).--Economist, _s._ of a banker, _b._ at  Langport, Somerset, _ed._ at University Coll., London, and called to the  Bar, but did not practise, and joined his _f._ in business. He wrote for  various periodicals, and from 1860 was editor of _The Economist_. He was  the author of _The English Constitution_ (1867), a standard work which  was translated into several languages; _Physics and Politics_ (1872), and  _Lombard Street_ (1873), a valuable financial work. A collection of  essays, biographical and economic, was _pub._ after his death.      BAILEY, PHILIP JAMES (1816-1902).--Poet, _s._ of a journalist, _b._ at  Nottingham, and _ed._ there and at Glasgow, of which he was made an LL.D.  in 1891. His life was a singularly uneventful one. He lived at  Nottingham, Jersey, Ilfracombe, London, and again at Nottingham, where he  _d._ He travelled a good deal on the Continent. He was by profession a  barrister, but never practised, and devoted his whole energies to poetry.  His first poem, _Festus_ (1839), is, for the daring of its theme and the  imaginative power and moral altitude which it displays, one of the most  notable of the century; as the work of one little past boyhood it is a  prodigy of intellectual precocity. Along with its great qualities it has  many faults in execution, and its final place in literature remains to  be determined. It was _pub._ anonymously, and had great success, but has  fallen into unmerited, but perhaps temporary, neglect. Among its greatest  admirers was Tennyson. The subsequent poems of B., _The Angel World_  (1850), _The Mystic_ (1855), _The Age_ (1858), and _The Universal Hymn_  (1867), were failures, and the author adopted the unfortunate expedient  of endeavouring to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#7)"],[1,"ghosts and ghost-seers that has appeared in English since the days  of Richard Glanvill; and with the others, it will be of service in  checking the progress of the pitiable superstition which has been  readily accepted by a large class of people, so peculiarly constituted  that they could not help rejecting the Christian religion for its  \"unreasonableness and incredibility!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Some Honest Opinions upon Authors, Books, and other subjects,\" is  the title of a new volume by the late Edgar A. Poe, which Mr. Redfield  will publish during the Fall. It will embrace besides several of the  author's most elaborate aesthetical essays, those caustic personalities  and criticisms from his pen which, during several years, attracted so  much attention in our literary world. Among his subjects are Bryant,  Cooper, Pauldings, Hawthorne, Willis, Longfellow, Verplanck, Bush,  Anthon, Hoffman, Cornelius Mathews, Henry B. Hirst, Mrs. Oakes Smith,  Mrs. Hewitt, Mrs. Lewis, Margaret Fuller, Miss Sedgwick, and many  more of this country, beside Macaulay, Bulwer, Dickens, Horne, Miss  Barrett, and some dozen others of England.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Dudley Bean occupies the first two sheets of the last  _Knickerbocker_ with a very erudite and picturesque description of  the attack upon Ticonderoga by the grand army under Lords Amherst and  Howe, in \"the old French War.\" Mr. Bean is an accomplished merchant,  of literary abilities and a taste for antiquarian research, and he is  probably better informed than any other person living upon the history  and topography of all the country for many miles about Lake George,  which is the most classical region of the United States. He has  treated the chief points of this history in many interesting papers  which he has within a few years contributed to the journals, and we  have promise of a couple of octavos, embracing the whole subject, from  his pen, at an early day. We know of nothing in the literature of our  local and particular history that is more pleasing than the specimens  of his quality in this way which have fallen under our notice.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. William Young, the thoroughly accomplished editor of the _Albion_,  is to be our creditor in the coming autumn for two hundred songs of  Beranger, in English, with the pictorial illustrations which graced  the splendid edition of the great lyrist's works recently issued in  Paris. Mr. Young may be said to be as familiar with the niceties of  the French language as the eloquent and forcible editorials of the  _Albion_ show him to be with those of his vernacular; and he has  studied Beranger with such a genial love and diligence, that he  would probably be one of his best editors, even in Paris. In literal  truth and elaborate finish, we think his volume will show him to be  a capital, a nearly faultless, translator. But Beranger is a very  difficult author to turn into English, and we believe all who have  hitherto essayed this labor have found his spirit too evanescent for  their art. The learned and brilliant \"Father Prout\" has been in some  respects the most successful of them all; but his versions are not to  be compared with Mr. Young's for adherence either to the bard's own  meaning or music. In pouring out the Frenchman's champagne, the latter  somehow suffers the sparkle and bead to escape, while the former  cheats us by making his stale liquor foam with London soda. We shall  be impatient for Mr. Young's book, which will be published by Putnam,  in a style of unusual beauty.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Achilli, whose history, so full of various and romantic  vicissitudes, has become familiar in consequence of his imprisonments  in the Roman Inquisition, is now in London, at the head of a  congregation of Protestant Italians. He has intimated to Dr. Baird his  intention to visit this country within a few months. He resided here  many years ago.           *       *       *       *       *    Shirley, by the author of Jane Eyre, has been translated into French,  and is appearing as the _feuilleton_ of the _National_, newspaper. Mr.  LIVERMORE, one of our most learned bibliopoles, has a very interesting  article upon Public Libraries, in the last _North American Review_.  He notices in detail several generally inaccessible reports on the  libraries of Europe and this country; after referring to the number  and extent of libraries here and elsewhere, and showing that in this  respect we rank far below most of the countries of Europe, though  second to none in general intelligence and the means of common  education, he urges the institution of a large national library, and  sees in the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution a prospect that  the subject is likely to receive speedy and efficient attention.           *       *       *       *       *    PROFESSOR JOHNSON, author of the well-known work on Agricultural  Chemistry, has been delivering lectures upon the results of his recent  tour in the British Provinces and the United States, in one of which  he observed, \"In New Brunswick, New England, Vermont, New Hampshire,  Connecticut, and New York, the growth of wheat has almost ceased; and  it is now gradually receding farther and farther westward. Now, when  I tell you this, you will see that it will not be very long before  America is unable supply us with wheat in any large quantity. If we  could bring Indian corn into general use, we might get plenty of it;  but I do not think that the United States need be any bug bear to  you.\" Prof. J. was in New York last March.           *       *       *       *       *    CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN, with Miss Hayes, the translator of George Sand's  best works, was at the last dates on a visit to the popular poetess  of the milliner and chambermaid classes, Eliza Cook, who was very ill.  Miss Cushman is really quite as good a poet as Miss Cook, though by no  means so fluent a versifier. She will return to the United States in a  few weeks to fulfill some professional engagements.           *       *       *       *       *    Rev. Mr. MOUNTFORD, an English Unitarian clergyman, who recently came  to this country, and who is known in literature and religion as the  author of the two very clever works, \"Martyria\" and \"Euthanasia,\" has  become minister of a congregation at Gloucester, in Massachusetts.           *       *       *       *       *    BENJAMIN PERLEY POORE, author of \"The Life and Times of Louis  Philippe,\" &c., invited the corps of Massachusetts Volunteers,  commanded by him in the Mexican campaign, to celebrate the anniversary  of their return, at his pleasant residence on Indian Hill Farm, in  West Newbury, last Friday.           *       *       *       *       *    Rev. WARREN BURTON, a graceful writer and popular preacher among the  Unitarians, has resigned the pastoral office in Worcester to give his  undivided attention to the advocacy of certain theories he has formed  for the moral education of the young.           *       *       *       *       *    RICHARD S. MCCULLOCH, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Princeton  College, and some time since melter and refiner of the United States  Mint, has addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, in  which he states that he has discovered a new, quick, and economical  method of refining argentiferous and other gold bullion, whereby the  work may be done in one-half the present time, and a large saving  effected in interest upon the amount refined.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LATE SIR JOSEPH BANKS lies buried in Heston Church. There is  neither inscription, nor monument, nor memorial window to mark the  place of his sepulture; even his hatchment has been removed from its  place. Surely, as President of the Royal Society, a member of so many  foreign institutions, as well as a man who had traveled so much, he  should have been thought worthy of some slight mark of respect.           *       *       *       *       *    ELIHU BURRITT is presented with the Prince of Wales in one of the  designs for medals to be distributed on the occasion of the great  Industrial Exhibition in London; and the Athenaeum properly suggests  that such an obtrusion of the \"learned Blacksmith\" (who has really  scarce any learning at all) is \"little better than a burlesque.\"           *       *       *       *       *    HORACE MANN, President of the late National Convention of the friends  of education, had issued an address inviting all friendly to the  object, whether connected with and interested in common-schools,  academies, or colleges, to meet in convention at Philadelphia on the  fourth day of August next.           *       *       *       *       *    LIEUT. MAURY says that the new planet, _Parthenope_, discovered by  M. Gasparis, of Naples, has been observed at Washington, by Mr. J.  Ferguson. It resembles a star of the tenth magnitude. This is the  eleventh in the family of asteroids, and the seventh within the last  five years.           *       *       *       *       *    GEORGE WILKINS KENDALL is now in New York, having visited New  Orleans since his return from Paris. His History of the Mexican War,  illustrated by some of the cleverest artists of France, will soon be  published here and in London.           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. FANNY KEMBLE has left this country for England, on account of the  sudden illness of her father, Charles Kemble, of whose low state of  health we have been apprised by almost every arrival for a year.           *       *       *       *       *    M. BALZAC's recent marriage, at his rather advanced period of life,  finds him, for the first time, an invalid, and serious fears are now  entertained for him, by friends and physicians.           *       *       *       *       *    ORESTES A.
