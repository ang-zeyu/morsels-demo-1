In forcing yourself to do  certain things you develop powers of Self-Expression. In one the Will  moves along negative lines. In the other along positive lines. Both are  necessary. The man who cannot control and command himself can never  develop and express Himself. But be sure to begin with easy things and  then as you gain in confidence you may attempt more difficult feats.    (_c_) The faculties of Courage and Confidence are essentially important.  Nothing weakens the will so much as Fear and lack of Self-Confidence.  Self-Confidence is not blustering self-conceit. That within you which  says \"I CAN\" when calmly and doggedly backed by your \"I Will\" when  deliberately translated into action develops Will-Force and commands  startling results.    (_d_) Always hold these words before your passive Mind:    1. Earnestness. 2. Determination. 3. Courage. 4. Confidence.  5. Stick-to-it-ive-ness. 6. Patience. 7. I can and I will.    (_e_) The tendency of the Masculine function of your mind to \"I\" is  towards giving, expressing or projecting energy; that of the Feminine  is towards generating and creating mental progeny such as thoughts,  mental energy, new habits, etc. It is why the Feminine Principle has  been called the \"mental womb\" by ancient philosophers. It comprises  also the faculty of Imagination. The Masculine function does the work  of the 'Will' in its varied phases. The Feminine function receives  impressions and generates mental offspring in the form of new thoughts,  ideas, concepts, thought-habits and so forth. Its powers of creative  energy are strikingly marvellous and have been proved and attested  to in Psychological experiments conducted by the best known mental  scientists of the day. _But \"positive\" mental energy must be projected by  the 'I' into the Passive Mind through concentration, suggestion and  willing before the latter can be started to work along any line of  creative effort._ This suggestion may be given by you to your  sub-conscious mind or it may come as an outer impression. Unless you  control your Passive Mind, it is sure to be controlled by others. Then  you are a slave. Now in cultivating the above seven qualities, you  should take up _one_ word at a time and let the outer form sink into your  mind. Place yourself in a relaxed and passive condition. Close your eyes  and picture the _form_ of the word to yourself, for instance,  D-E-T-E-R-M-I-N-A-T-I-O-N. Employ the Imagination and visualize mentally.  This done, _i.e._, when the word-picture is well photographed upon your  mind and fastened in place, your next step will be to picture yourself  the Ideas, qualities, physical and mental characteristics, etc.,  associated with the word. Your third step is to calmly, concentratedly  and confidently command your Passive Mind to generate that quality.  Remember, your mind will at first rebel, but a very little persistence  will lead to complete success. Repeat the auto-suggestions daily at the  same time. See that it manifests in Action. Act it out as often as  possible. Of course your efforts will be imperfect to begin with, but,  never mind, go ahead, keeping firm hold on your \"I can and I will\" in  spite of all things and success is quite certain. Once you have developed  these seven qualities, you can do anything.    (_f_) Do not let your friends or anyone--no matter who!--deflect  you from your resolutions. \"Let not thy right hand know what thy left  hand does.\" Talk never. Let results show. The Lord has hidden himself  best and His work is wonderful beyond compare! Your very friends  and relatives will spit upon you for lacking any of these qualities. Do  not ever impose your will upon others, but never let others to impose  upon you against the sanction of your own judgment. In fact, none can  unless you are a weakling and fickle-minded.    (_g_) Frequent the company of chaste, strong-willed men and you  cannot but grow strong.    (_h_) Read Literature on this subject and obtain all possible aid  through Knowledge.    (_i_) If your faculty of imagination and idealism are undeveloped,  cultivate them, because it is these two that make a god of a man.  Philosophers, scholars, poets and musicians have them well-developed. But  where imagination is uncontrolled by higher reason and where idealism  is not backed by a strong will, there you have the idle 'dreamer of  dreams' and such a state of mind is reprehensible and pitiable indeed!    (_j_) Will-Power grows by faith in one's ability by exercise; by  devotion to the UNCONDITIONED SPIRIT.    (_k_) In your efforts to develop Will-Power, be not afraid that your  health will break down. In fact, Perfect Health is the result of a  perfect Will. Deny the power of disease and weakness over yourself. \"_I  can never be ill. My body is my slave. It shall always manifest perfect  health_.\" Convince your passive mind--which has charge of your body--of  this by repeated commands, demands and assertions. Always think of your  body as being as strong as adamant. Never talk of either health or  disease or weakness. You must be above caring for these. They are  your Natural rights. Only when you lower yourself they have power  to trouble you. Go beyond the lower self. Your business is to care for  the Higher-Self--that in which \"You\" live, move, and have your being.  Also teach and train your Will to move along negative lines of  self-repression as well as along positive lines of Self-Expression.  Balance both. The former precedes the latter. Now I will pass on to the  subject of SELF-CONTROL, with the distinct understanding that  Self-Control and Will-Power are inextricably bound up in each other. You  Get the real \"practical work\" in the endeavour for Self-Control.      SELF-CONTROL.    Rightly has it been remarked that is easy to talk of and write upon this  subject but most difficult to possess it. Perfect Self-Control means  infinite power. Only the Buddas and the Christs of this World manifested  Perfect Self-Control. \"Anything short of the absolute control of thought,  word and deed is only sowing wild oats,\" said Vivekananda. It is with no  little diffidence that I approach this subject as whoever handles  this subject is rightly culpable as being a \"Do-as-I-say-and-not-as-I-do\"  class of writers. Still you can make appreciable progress in this  direction by mastering these instructions, going through the exercises  and last but most important by \"carrying the principles in your mind\" and  applying them as far as you can in your daily life. Nothing is more  conducive to rapid growth and development as the making of the \"little  and big\" affairs in your work-a-day life, the occasion for the practical  expression and conscious translation of your ideals. We all are guilty of  a serious mistake in setting apart our higher ideals for regular  'practice' hours and leading a life of low and quite different ideals in  our ordinary life. The natural process, as you can see, is to LIVE OUT  your highest ideals every minute of your life. Nothing is more important  than the daily occupation of a man and if he fails to bring his ideals  right into these little things, then Success will ever elude him. A  mental scientist has summed up the entire secret of Character-Building in  this valuable advice on Objective Concentration: the simple task of  mental concentration on whatever task, business or profession a man is  engaged in is the beginning of the mastery which is the perfection of  Objective Concentration. Whatever you are doing be master of your work.  If you are a cobbler mend shoes in a perfect manner; if a barber keep  your razors and scissors in a state that will excite the admiration of  your customers; if a tailor make the coat fit like a glove; if a clerk  keep your accounts in apple-pie order; if a builder scorn your  jerry-brother; if a singer enchant the listener with a concord of sweet  sounds; if an actor enter into the spirit of the character and make the  play-goer feel that    \"All the world's a stage  And all the men and women merely players,  They have their exits and their entrance  And one man in his time plays many parts.\"    If a leader in any department of thought or action, remember that if to  you much is given, from you also much is required, for the responsibility  of the lives and happiness of your fellows rests heavy on your shoulders,  whether you know it or not and thousands may secretly curse your  incapacity and bungling. It is infinitely better to be a good cobbler  than a bad ruler.    I believe the above advice if followed conscientiously by you would  go to make you really fit for initiation into the more advanced stages of  mastery. Take it to heart by all means. Be convinced, the man who  looks for quick results and a royal road to the mastery of Mental Science  breaks down in frequent despair at apparent failures and neglects his  daily work will never go far. In fact, his very impatience will lead to  failure. No individual life is fully rounded out unless some useful work  forms part of it. The Yogi who has renounced the world has already  done his work and is ahead of the times. The real hermit and the saint  are the Pillars of Strength on which this world stands. I cannot repeat  this too often. The mere fact of their breathing the same atmosphere  as you is a benediction and an inestimable boon unto the race.      PRELIMINARY STEPS.    \"The first requisite,\" says Mr. Atkinson, \"of concentering is the  ability to shut out outside thoughts, sights and sounds; to conquer  inattention; to obtain perfect control over the body and mind. The body  must be brought under the control of the mind; the mind under the  direct control of the Will. The Will is strong enough, but the mind needs  strengthening by being brought under the direct influence of the will.  The mind, strengthened by the impulse of the will, becomes a much more  powerful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13325"],[0,"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon (#7)"],[1,"ers, that frequently, large branches give way beneath their  accumulated weight. Every forenoon, generally between the hours of 9 and  11 A.M., they take to wing, apparently for exercise, and possibly to sun  their wings and fur, and dry them after the dews of the early morning.  On these occasions, their numbers are quite surprising, flying in clouds  as thick as bees or midges. After these recreations, they hurry back to  their favourite trees, chattering and screaming like monkeys, and always  wrangling and contending angrily for the most shady and comfortable  places in which to hang for the rest of the day protected from the sun.  The branches they resort to soon become almost divested of leaves, these  being stripped off by the action of the bats, attaching and detaching  themselves by means of their hooked feet. At sunset, they fly off to  their feeding-grounds, probably at a considerable distance, as it  requires a large area to furnish sufficient food for such multitudes.    In all its movements and attitudes, the action of the _Pteropus_  is highly interesting. If placed upon the ground, it is almost  helpless, none of its limbs being calculated for progressive motion;  it drags itself along by means of the hook attached to each of its  extended thumbs, pushing at the same time with those of its hind feet.  Its natural position is exclusively pensile; it moves laterally from  branch to branch with great ease, by using each foot alternately, and  climbs, when necessary, by means of its claws.    When at rest, or asleep, the disposition of the limbs is most curious.  At such times it suspends itself by one foot only, bringing the other  close to its side, and thus it is enabled to wrap itself in the ample  folds of its wings, which envelop it like a mantle, leaving only its  upturned head uncovered. Its fur is thus protected from damp and rain,  and to some extent its body is sheltered from the sun.    As it collects its food by means of its mouth, either when on the  wing, or when suspended within reach of it, the flying-fox is always  more or less liable to have the spoil wrested from it by its intrusive  companions, before it can make good its way to some secure retreat in  which to devour it unmolested. In such conflicts they bite viciously,  tear each other with their hooks, and scream incessantly, till, taking  to flight, the persecuted one reaches some place of safety, where he  hangs by one foot, and grasping the fruit he has secured in the claws  and opposable thumb of the other, he hastily reduces it to lumps, with  which he stuffs his cheek pouches till they become distended like those  of a monkey; then suspended in safety, he commences to chew and suck the  pieces, rejecting the refuse with his tongue.    To drink, which it does by lapping, the _Pteropus_ suspends  itself head downwards from a branch above the water.    Insects, caterpillars, birds' eggs, and young birds are devoured by  them; and the Singhalese say that the flying-fox will even attack a  tree snake. It is killed by the natives for the sake of its flesh,  which, I have been told by a gentleman who has eaten of it, resembles  that of the hare.[1] It is strongly attracted to the coconut trees  during the period when toddy is drawn for distillation, and exhibits,  it is said, at such times, symptoms resembling intoxication.    [Footnote 1: In Western India the native Portuguese eat the  flying-fox, and pronounce it delicate, and far from disagreeable in  flavour.]    Neither the flying-fox, nor any other bat that I know of in Ceylon,  ever hybernates.    There are several varieties (one of them peculiar to the island) of  the horse-shoe-headed _Rhinolophus_, with the strange leaf-like  appendage erected on the extremity of the nose.    It has been suggested that the insectivorous bats, though nocturnal,  are deficient in that keen vision characteristic of animals which take  their prey by night.    [Illustration: RINOLOPHUS.]    I doubt whether this conjecture be well founded; it certainly does not  apply to the _Pteropus_ and the other frugivorous species, in  which the faculty of sight is singularly clear. As regards the others,  it is possible that in their peculiar oeconomy some additional power  may be required to act in concert with that of vision, as in insects,  touch is superadded, in its most sensitive development, to that of  sight. It is probable that the noseleaf, which forms an extended  screen stretched behind the nostrils in some of the bats, may be  intended by nature to facilitate the collection and conduction of  odours, just as the vast expansion of the shell of the ear in the same  family is designed to assist in the collection of sounds--and thus to  supplement their vision when in pursuit of prey in the dusk by the  superior sensitiveness of the organs of hearing and smell.    One tiny little bat, not much larger than the humble  bee[1], and of a glossy black colour, is sometimes to be seen about  Colombo. It is so familiar and gentle that it will alight on the cloth  during dinner, and manifests so little alarm that it seldom makes any  effort to escape before a wine glass can be inverted to secure it.    [Footnote 1: It is a _very_ small Singhalese variety of  Scotophilus Coromandelicus, _F. Cuv._]    Although not strictly in order, this seems not an inappropriate place  to notice one of the most curious peculiarities connected with the  bats--their singular parasite, the Nycteribia.[1] On cursory  observation this creature appears to have neither head, antennae, eyes,  nor mouth; and the earlier observers of its structure satisfied  themselves that the place of the latter was supplied by a cylindrical  sucker, which, being placed between the shoulders, the insect had no  option but to turn on its back to feed. Another anomaly was thought to  compensate for this apparent inconvenience;--its three pairs of legs,  armed with claws, are so arranged that they seem to be equally  distributed over its upper and under sides, the creature being thus  enabled to use them like hands, and to grasp the strong hairs above it  while extracting its nourishment.    [Footnote 1: This extraordinary creature had formerly been discovered  only on a few European bats. Joinville figured one which he found on  the large roussette (the flying-fox), and says he had seen another on  a bat of the same family. Dr. Templeton observed them in Ceylon in  great abundance on the fur of the _Scotophilus Coromandelicus_,  and they will, no doubt, be found on many others.]    It moves, in fact, by rolling itself rapidly along, rotating like a  wheel on the extremities of its spokes, or like the clown in a  pantomime, hurling himself forward on hands and feet alternately. Its  celerity is so great that Colonel Montague, who was one of the first  to describe it minutely[1], says its speed exceeds that of any  known insect, and as its joints are so flexible as to yield in every  direction (like what mechanics call a \"ball and socket\"), its motions  are exceedingly grotesque as it tumbles through the fur of the bat.    [Footnote 1: Celeripes vespertilionis, _Mont. Lin. Trans._ xi. p.11.]    [Illustration: NYCTERBIA.]    To enable it to attain its marvellous velocity, each foot is armed  with two sharp hooks, with elastic opposable pads, so that the hair  can not only be rapidly seized and firmly held, but as quickly  disengaged, as the creature whirls away in its headlong career.    The insects to which it bears the nearest affinity, are the  _Hippoboscidae_, or \"spider flies,\" that infest birds and horses;  but, unlike them, the Nycteribia is unable to fly.    Its strangest peculiarity, and that which gave rise to the belief that  it was headless, is its faculty when at rest of throwing back its head  and pressing it close between its shoulders till the under side  becomes uppermost, not a vestige of head being discernible where we  would naturally look for it, and the whole seeming but a casual  inequality on its back.    On closer examination this, apparent tubercle is found to have a  leathery attachment like a flexible neck, and by a sudden jerk the  little creature is enabled to project it forward into its normal  position, when it is discovered to be furnished with a mouth, antennae,  and four eyes, two on each side.    The organisation of such an insect is a marvellous adaptation of  physical form to special circumstances. As the nycteribia has to make  its way through fur and hairs, its feet are furnished with prehensile  hooks that almost convert them into hands; and being obliged to conform  to the sudden flights of its patron, and accommodate itself to inverted  positions, all attitudes are rendered alike to it by the arrangement of its  limbs, which enables it, after every possible gyration, to find itself  always on its feet.    III. CARNIVORA.--_Bears_.--Of the _carnivora_, the one most  dreaded by the natives of Ceylon, and the only one of the larger  animals that makes the depths of the forest its habitual retreat, is  the bear[1], attracted chiefly by the honey which is found in the  hollow trees and clefts of the rocks. Occasionally spots of fresh  earth are observed which have been turned up by the bears in search of  some favourite root. They feed also on the termites and ants. A friend  of mine traversing the forest, near Jaffna, at early dawn, had his  attention attracted by the growling of a bear, that was seated upon a  lofty branch, thrusting portions of a red-ants' nest into his mouth  with one paw, whilst with the other he endeavoured to clear his  eyebrows and lips of the angry inmates, which bit and tortured him in  their rage. The Ceylon bear is found in the low and dry districts of  the northern and south-eastern coast, and is seldom met with on the  mountains or the moist and damp plains of the west. It is furnished  with a bushy tuft of hair on the back, between the shoulders, by which  the young are"]]]
