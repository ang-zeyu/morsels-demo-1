These etymologies are more  ingenious than convincing, and are not entirely true to Hebrew philology,  but neither were those of the early rabbis; and they at least show that  Philo had acquired a superficial knowledge of the language of Scripture.  Nor can it be doubted that he was acquainted with the Palestinian Midrash,  both Halakic and Haggadic. At the beginning of the \"Life of Moses\" he  declares that he has based it upon \"many traditions which I have  received from the elders of my nation,\"[51] and in several places he  speaks of the \"ancestral philosophy,\" which must mean the Midrash  which embodied tradition. Eusebius also, the early Christian  authority, bears witness to his knowledge of the traditional  interpretations of the law.[52]    It is fairly certain, moreover, that Philo sojourned some time in  Jerusalem. He was there probably during the reign of Agrippa (_c._ 30  C.E.), who was an intimate friend of his family, and had found a  refuge at Alexandria when an exile from Palestine and Rome. In the  first book on the Mosaic laws[53] Philo speaks with enthusiasm of the  great temple, to which \"vast assemblies of men from a countless  variety of cities, some by land, some by sea, from East, West, North,  and South, come at every festival as if to some common refuge and  harbor from the troubles of this harassed and anxious life, seeking to  find there tranquillity and gain a new hope in life by its joyous  festivities.\" These gatherings, at which, according to Josephus,[54]  over two million people assembled, must, indeed, have been a striking  symbol of the unity of the Jewish race, which was at once national and  international; magnificent embassies from Babylon and Persia, from  Egypt and Cyrene, from Rome and Greece, even from distant Spain and  Gaul, went in procession together through the gate of Xistus up the  temple-mount, which was crowned by the golden sanctuary, shining in  the full Eastern sun like a sea of light above the town. Philo  describes in detail the form of the edifice that moved the admiration  of all who beheld it, and for the Jew, moreover, was invested with the  most cherished associations. Its outer courts consisted of double  porticoes of marble columns burnished with gold, then came the inner  courts of simple columns, and \"within these stood the temple itself,  beautiful beyond all possible description, as one may tell even from  what is seen in the outer court; for the innermost sanctuary is  invisible to every being except the high priest.\" The majesty of the  ceremonial within equalled the splendor without. The high priest, in  the words of Ben Sira (xlv), \"beautified with comely ornament and  girded about with a robe of glory,\" seemed a high priest fit for the  whole world. Upon his head the mitre with a crown of gold engraved  with holiness, upon his breast the mystic Urim and Thummim and the  ephod with its twelve brilliant jewels, upon his tunic golden  pomegranates and silver bells, which for the mystic ear pealed the  harmony of the world as he moved. Little wonder that, inspired by the  striking gathering and the solemn ritual, Philo regarded the temple as  the shrine of the universe,[55] and thought the day was near when all  nations should go up there together, to do worship to the One God.    Sparse as are the direct proofs of Philo's connection with Palestinian  Judaism, his account of the temple and its service, apart from the  general standpoint of his writings, proves to us that he was a loyal  son of his nation, and loved Judaism for its national institutions as  well as its great moral sublimity. His aspiration was to bring home  the truths of the religion to the cultured world, and therefore he  devised a new expression for the wisdom of his people, and transformed  it into a literary system. Judaism forms the kernel, but Greek  philosophy and literature the shell, of his work; for the audience to  which he appealed, whether Jewish or Gentile, thought in Greek, and  would be moved only by ideas presented in Greek form, and by Greek  models he himself was inspired.    Philo's first ideal of life was to attain to the profoundest knowledge  of God so as to be fitted for the mission of interpreting His Word:  and he relates in one of his treatises how he spent his youth and his  first manhood in philosophy and the contemplation of the universe.[56]  \"I feasted with the truly blessed mind, which is the object of all  desire (_i.e._, God), communing continually in joy with the Divine  words and doctrines. I entertained no low or mean thought, nor did I  ever crawl about glory or wealth or worldly comfort, but I seemed to  be carried aloft in a kind of spiritual inspiration and to be borne  along in harmony with the whole universe.\" The intense religious  spirit which seeks to perceive all things in a supreme unity Philo  shares with Spinoza, whose life-ideal was the intuitional knowledge of  the universe and \"the intellectual love of God.\" Both men show the  pursuit of righteousness raised to philosophical grandeur.    In his early days the way to virtue and happiness appeared to Philo to  lie in the solitary and ascetic life. He was possessed by a noble  pessimism, that the world was an evil place,[57] and the worldly life  an evil thing for a man's soul, that man must die to live, and  renounce the pleasures not only of the body but also of society in  order to know God. The idea was a common one of the age, and was the  outcome of the mingling of Greek ethics and psychology and the Jewish  love of righteousness. For the Greek thinkers taught a psychological  dualism, by which the body and the senses were treated as antagonistic  to the higher intellectual soul, which was immortal, and linked man  with the principle of creation. The most remarkable and enduring  effect of Hellenic influence in Palestine was the rise of the sect of  Essenes,[58] Jewish mystics, who eschewed private property and the  general social life, and forming themselves into communistic  congregations which were a sort of social Utopia, devoted their lives  to the cult of piety and saintliness. It cannot be doubted that their  manner of life was to some degree an imitation of the Pythagorean  brotherhoods, which ever since the sixth century had spread a sort of  monasticism through the Greek world. Nor is it unlikely that Hindu  teachings exercised an influence over them, for Buddhism was at this  age, like Judaism, a missionizing religion, and had teachers in the  West. Philo speaks in several places of its doctrines.[59] Whatever  its moulding influences, Essenism represented the spirit of the age,  and it spread far and wide. At Alexandria, above all places, where the  life of luxury and dissoluteness repelled the serious, ascetic ideas  took firm hold of the people, and the Therapeutic life, _i.e._, the  life of prayer and labor devoted to God, which corresponded to the  system of the Essenes, had numerous votaries. The first century  witnessed the extremes of the religious and irreligious sentiments.  The world was weary and jaded; it had lost confidence in human reason  and faith in social ideals, and while the materialists abandoned  themselves to hideous orgies and sensual debaucheries, the  higher-minded went to the opposite excess and sought by flight from  the world and mortification of the flesh to attain to supernatural  states of ecstasy. A book has come down to us under the name of  Philo[60] which describes \"the contemplative life\" of a Jewish  brotherhood that lived apart on the shores of Lake Mareotis by the  mouth of the Nile. Men and women lived in the settlement, though all  intercourse between the sexes was rigidly avoided. During six days of  the week they met in prayer, morning and evening, and in the interval  devoted themselves in solitude to the practice of virtue and the study  of the holy allegories, and the composition of hymns and psalms. On  the Sabbath they sat in common assembly, but with the women separated  from the men, and listened to the allegorical homily of an elder; they  paid special honor to the Feast of Pentecost, reverencing the mystical  attributes of the number fifty, and they celebrated a religious  banquet thereon. During the rest of the year they only partook of the  sustenance necessary for life, and thus in their daily conduct  realized the way which the rabbis set out as becoming for the study of  the Torah: \"A morsel of bread with salt thou must eat, and water by  measure thou must drink; thou must sleep upon the ground and live a  life of hardship, the while thou toilest in the Torah.\"[61]    We do not know whether Philo attached himself to one of these  brotherhoods of organized solitude, or whether he lived even more  strictly the solitary life out in the wilderness by himself. Certainly  he was at one period in sympathy with ascetic ideas. It seemed to him  that as God was alone, so man must be alone in order to be like  God.[62] In his earlier writings he is constantly praising the ascetic  life, as a means, indeed, to virtue rather than as a good in itself,  and as a helpful discipline to the man of incomplete moral strength,  though inferior to the spontaneous goodness which God vouchsafes to  the righteous. Isaac is the type of this highest bliss, while the life  of Jacob is the type of the progress to virtue through asceticism.[63]  The flight from Laban represents the abandonment of family and social  life for the practical service of God, and as Jacob, the ascetic,  became Israel, \"the man who beholdeth God,\" so Philo determined \"to  scorn delights and live laborious days\" in order to be drawn nearer to  the true Being.

SHAKESPEARE AND CHRISTMAS    _By_    FR*NK H*RR*S      That Shakespeare hated Christmas--hated it with a venom utterly  alien to the gentle heart in him--I take to be a proposition that  establishes itself automatically. If there is one thing lucid-obvious  in the Plays and Sonnets, it is Shakespeare's unconquerable loathing  of Christmas. The Professors deny it, however, or deny that it is  proven. With these gentlemen I will deal faithfully. I will meet them  on their own parched ground, making them fertilise it by shedding  there the last drop of the water that flows through their veins.    If you find, in the works of a poet whose instinct is to write about  everything under the sun, one obvious theme untouched, or touched  hardly at all, then it is at least presumable that there was some good  reason for that abstinence. Such a poet was Shakespeare. It was one of  the divine frailties of his genius that he must be ever flying off at  a tangent from his main theme to unpack his heart in words about some  frivolous-small irrelevance that had come into his head. If it could  be shown that he never mentioned Christmas, we should have proof  presumptive that he consciously avoided doing so. But if the fact  is that he did mention it now and again, but in grudging fashion,  without one spark of illumination--he, the arch-illuminator of all  things--then we have proof positive that he detested it.    I see Dryasdust thumbing his Concordance. Let my memory save him the  trouble. I will reel him off the one passage in which Shakespeare  spoke of Christmas in words that rise to the level of mediocrity.      Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,    So hallowed and so gracious is the time.    So says Marcellus at Elsinore. This is the best our Shakespeare can  vamp up for the birthday of the Man with whom he of all men had the  most in common. And Dryasdust, eternally unable to distinguish chalk  from cheese, throws up his hands in admiration of the marvellous  poetry. If Dryasdust had written it, it would more than pass  muster. But as coming from Shakespeare, how feeble-cold--aye,  and sulky-sinister! The greatest praiser the world will ever  know!--and all he can find in his heart to sing of Christmas is a  stringing-together of old women's superstitions! Again and again he  has painted Winter for us as it never has been painted since--never  by Goethe even, though Goethe in more than one of the _Winter-Lieder_  touched the hem of his garment. There was every external reason why  he should sing, as only he could have sung, of Christmas. The Queen  set great store by it. She and her courtiers celebrated it year by  year with lusty-pious unction. And thus the ineradicable snob in  Shakespeare had the most potent of all inducements to honour the feast  with the full power that was in him. But he did not, because he would  not. What is the key to the enigma?    For many years I hunted it vainly. The second time that I met Carlyle  I tried to enlist his sympathy and aid. He sat pensive for a while and  then said that it seemed to him \"a goose-quest.\" I replied, \"You have  always a phrase for everything, Tom, but always the wrong one.\" He  covered his face, and presently, peering at me through his gnarled  fingers, said \"Mon, ye're recht.\" I discussed the problem with Renan,  with Emerson, with Disraeli, also with Cetewayo--poor Cetewayo, best  and bravest of men, but intellectually a Professor, like the rest of  them. It was borne in on me that if I were to win to the heart of the  mystery I must win alone.    The solution, when suddenly it dawned on me, was so simple-stark that  I was ashamed of the ingenious-clever ways I had been following. (I  learned then--and perhaps it is the one lesson worth the learning of  any man--that truth may be approached only through the logic of the  heart. For the heart is eye and ear, and all excellent understanding  abides there.) On Christmas Day, assuredly, Anne Hathaway was born.    In what year she was born I do not know nor care. I take it she  was not less than thirty-eight when she married Shakespeare. This,  however, is sheer conjecture, and in no way important-apt to our  inquiry. It is not the year, but the day of the year, that matters.  All we need bear in mind is that on Christmas Day that woman was born  into the world.    If there be any doubting Thomas among my readers, let him not  be afraid to utter himself. I am (with the possible exception of  Shakespeare) the gentlest man that ever breathed, and I do but bid him  study the Plays in the light I have given him. The first thing that  will strike him is that Shakespeare's thoughts turned constantly to  the birthdays of all his Fitton-heroines, as a lover's thoughts always  do turn to the moment at which the loved one first saw the light.  \"There was a star danced, and under that\" was born Beatrice. Juliet  was born \"on Lammas Eve.\" Marina tells us she derived her name from  the chance of her having been \"born at sea.\" And so on, throughout the  whole gamut of women in whom Mary Fitton was bodied forth to us. But  mark how carefully Shakespeare says never a word about the birthdays  of the various shrews and sluts in whom,"]]]
