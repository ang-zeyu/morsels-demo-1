Let him that findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words \"In  the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure\", and then proceed to his  devotions. Such is the command of the Lord of all worlds. In regions where  the days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by clocks and  other instruments that mark the passage of the hours. He, verily, is the  Expounder, the Wise.    11 We have absolved you from the requirement of performing the Prayer of  the Signs. On the appearance of fearful natural events call ye to mind the  might and majesty of your Lord, He Who heareth and seeth all, and say  \"Dominion is God's, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of  creation\".    12 It hath been ordained that obligatory prayer is to be performed by each  of you individually. Save in the Prayer for the Dead, the practice of  congregational prayer hath been annulled. He, of a truth, is the Ordainer,  the All-Wise.    13 God hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory prayer  and fasting. Let them, instead, after performance of their ablutions, give  praise unto God, repeating ninety-five times between the noon of one day  and the next \"Glorified be God, the Lord of Splendour and Beauty\". Thus  hath it been decreed in the Book, if ye be of them that comprehend.    14 When travelling, if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot, perform  ye--men and women alike--a single prostration in place of each unsaid  Obligatory Prayer, and while prostrating say \"Glorified be God, the Lord  of Might and Majesty, of Grace and Bounty\". Whoso is unable to do this,  let him say only \"Glorified be God\"; this shall assuredly suffice him. He  is, of a truth, the all-sufficing, the ever-abiding, the forgiving,  compassionate God. Upon completing your prostrations, seat yourselves  cross-legged--men and women alike--and eighteen times repeat \"Glorified be  God, the Lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven\". Thus doth the Lord  make plain the ways of truth and guidance, ways that lead to one way,  which is this Straight Path. Render thanks unto God for this most gracious  favour; offer praise unto Him for this bounty that hath encompassed the  heavens and the earth; extol Him for this mercy that hath pervaded all  creation.    15 Say: God hath made My hidden love the key to the Treasure; would that  ye might perceive it! But for the key, the Treasure would to all eternity  have remained concealed; would that ye might believe it! Say: This is the  Source of Revelation, the Dawning-place of Splendour, Whose brightness  hath illumined the horizons of the world. Would that ye might understand!  This is, verily, that fixed Decree through which every irrevocable decree  hath been established.    16 O Pen of the Most High! Say: O people of the world! We have enjoined  upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have designated  for you Naw-Ruz as a feast. Thus hath the Day-Star of Utterance shone  forth above the horizon of the Book as decreed by Him Who is the Lord of  the beginning and the end. Let the days in excess of the months be placed  before the month of fasting. We have ordained that these, amid all nights  and days, shall be the manifestations of the letter Ha, and thus they have  not been bounded by the limits of the year and its months. It behoveth the  people of Baha, throughout these days, to provide good cheer for  themselves, their kindred and, beyond them, the poor and needy, and with  joy and exultation to hail and glorify their Lord, to sing His praise and  magnify His Name; and when they end--these days of giving that precede the  season of restraint--let them enter upon the Fast. Thus hath it been  ordained by Him Who is the Lord of all mankind. The traveller, the ailing,  those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the Fast; they  have been exempted by God as a token of His grace. He, verily, is the  Almighty, the Most Generous.    17 These are the ordinances of God that have been set down in the Books  and Tablets by His Most Exalted Pen. Hold ye fast unto His statutes and  commandments, and be not of those who, following their idle fancies and  vain imaginings, have clung to the standards fixed by their own selves,  and cast behind their backs the standards laid down by God. Abstain from  food and drink from sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive you  of this grace that is appointed in the Book.    18 It hath been ordained that every believer in God, the Lord of  Judgement, shall, each day, having washed his hands and then his face,  seat himself and, turning unto God, repeat \"Allah-u-Abha\" ninety-five  times. Such was the decree of the Maker of the Heavens when, with majesty  and power, He established Himself upon the thrones of His Names. Perform  ye, likewise, ablutions for the Obligatory Prayer; this is the command of  God, the Incomparable, the Unrestrained.    19 Ye have been forbidden to commit murder or adultery, or to engage in  backbiting or calumny; shun ye, then, what hath been prohibited in the  holy Books and Tablets.    20 We have divided inheritance into seven categories: to the children, We  have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares; to the  wife, eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares; to the  father, seven parts comprising four hundred and twenty shares; to the  mother, six parts comprising three hundred and sixty shares; to the  brothers, five parts or three hundred shares; to the sisters, four parts  or two hundred and forty shares; and to the teachers, three parts or one  hundred and eighty shares. Such was the ordinance of My Forerunner, He Who  extolleth My Name in the night season and at the break of day. When We  heard the clamour of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share  and decreased those of the rest. He, of a truth, hath power to ordain  whatsoever He desireth, and He doeth as He pleaseth by virtue of His  sovereign might.    21 Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the  House of Justice, to be expended by the Trustees of the All-Merciful on  the orphaned and widowed, and on whatsoever will bring benefit to the  generality of the people, that all may give thanks unto their Lord, the  All-Gracious, the Pardoner.    22 Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories  of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall receive two  thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the  House of Justice. Such is the command which hath been given, in majesty  and glory, by Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High.    23 If the deceased should leave none of the specified heirs, but have  among his relatives nephews and nieces, whether on his brother's or his  sister's side, two thirds of the inheritance shall pass to them; or,  lacking these, to his uncles and aunts on both his father's and his  mother's side, and after them to their sons and daughters. The remaining  third of the inheritance shall, in any case, revert to the Seat of  Justice. Thus hath it been laid down in the Book by Him Who ruleth over  all men.    24 Should the deceased be survived by none of those whose names have been  recorded by the Pen of the Most High, his estate shall, in its entirety,  revert to the aforementioned Seat that it may be expended on that which is  prescribed by God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omnipotent.    25 We have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to  the male, not female, offspring, nor to the other heirs. He, verily, is  the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.    26 Should the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his  father and have left children, they will inherit their father's share, as  prescribed in the Book of God. Divide ye their share amongst them with  perfect justice. Thus have the billows of the Ocean of Utterance surged,  casting forth the pearls of the laws decreed by the Lord of all mankind.    27 If the deceased should leave children who are under age, their share of  the inheritance must be entrusted to a reliable individual, or to a  company, that it may be invested on their behalf in trade and business  until they come of age. The trustee should be assigned a due share of the  profit that hath accrued to it from being thus employed.    28 Division of the estate should take place only after the Huququ'llah  hath been paid, any debts have been settled, the expenses of the funeral  and burial defrayed, and such provision made that the deceased may be  carried to his resting-place with dignity and honour. Thus hath it been  ordained by Him Who is Lord of the beginning and the end.    29 Say: This is that hidden knowledge which shall never change, since its  beginning is with nine, the symbol that betokeneth the concealed and  manifest, the inviolable and unapproachably exalted Name. As for what We  have appropriated to the children, this is a bounty conferred on them by  God, that they may render thanks unto their Lord, the Compassionate, the  Merciful. These, verily, are the Laws of God; transgress them not at the  prompting of your base and selfish desires. Observe ye the injunctions  laid upon you by Him Who is the Dawning-place of Utterance. The sincere  among His servants will regard the precepts set forth by God as the Water  of Life to the followers of every faith, and the Lamp of wisdom and loving  providence to all the denizens of earth and heaven.    30 The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be  established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha, and  should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should consider  themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted, the  Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It behoveth them to be  the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the  guardians appointed of God for all that dwell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#7)"],[1," careful  to send courteous and conciliatory replies. The correspondence which  took place confirmed him in his frequently expressed opinion that it  would be greatly to the advantage of the Government, and obviate  the necessity for keeping such large garrisons on the frontier, if  friendly relations could be established with the Amir, and with the  neighbouring tribes, who more or less looked to the Ruler of Kabul  as their Chief. My father accordingly addressed the Secretary to the  Government of India, and pointed out how successfully some of the most  experienced Anglo-Indian officials had managed barbarous tribes by  kindness and conciliation.    My father was prevented by ill-health from remaining long enough at  Peshawar to see the result of his proposals, but it was a source of  great satisfaction to him to learn before he left India[1] that they  were approved by Lord Dalhousie (the Governor-General), and that they  were already bearing fruit. That the Amir was himself ready to respond  to any overtures made to him was evident from a letter written by a  brother of the Dost's, which was discovered amongst the papers of  Colonel Mackeson (the Commissioner of Peshawar) after his death. It  was still more gratifying to my father to find that the views of  Mackeson's successor, Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Edwardes, on this  subject entirely coincided with his own. This distinguished officer  and brilliant administrator zealously maintained this policy, and  succeeded in establishing such a good understanding with the Ruler  of Kabul that, when the Mutiny broke out, Afghanistan stood aloof,  instead of, as might have been the case, turning the scale against us.    The Peshawar division in 1852 was not only the most important, but  the largest, in India. It included besides Attock, Rawal Pindi, and  Jhelum, the hill-station of Murree, which had only been recently  occupied. The cantonment of Peshawar had been laid out by Sir Colin  Campbell (afterwards Lord Clyde), who commanded there when we first  occupied that place in 1849. He crowded the troops, European and  Native, into as small a space as possible in order that the station  might be the more easily protected from the raids of the Afridis  and other robber tribes, who had their homes in the neighbouring  mountains, and constantly descended into the valley for the sake of  plunder. To resist these marauders it was necessary to place guards  all round the cantonment. The smaller the enclosure, the fewer guards  would be required. From this point of view alone was Sir Colin's  action excusable; but the result of this overcrowding was what it  always is, especially in a tropical climate like that of India, and  for long years Peshawar was a name of terror to the English soldier  from its proverbial unhealthiness. The water-supply for the first  five-and-twenty years of our occupation was extremely bad, and  sanitary arrangements, particularly as regards Natives, were  apparently considered unnecessary.    In addition to the cordon of sentries round the cantonment, strong  piquets were posted on all the principal roads leading towards the  hills; and every house had to be guarded by a _chokidar_, or watchman,  belonging to one of the robber tribes. The maintaining this watchman  was a sort of blackmail, without consenting to which no one's horses  or other property were safe. The watchmen were armed with all sorts of  quaint old firearms, which, on an alarm being given, they discharged  in the most reckless manner, making it quite a work of danger to pass  along a Peshawar road after dark. No one was allowed to venture beyond  the line of sentries when the sun had set, and even in broad daylight  it was not safe to go any distance from the station.    In the autumn of 1851 an officer--Captain Frank Grantham, of the 98th  Foot--was riding with a young lady on the Michni road, not far from  the Artillery quarter-guard, when he was attacked by five hill-men.  Grantham was wounded so severely that he died in a few days, the  horses were carried off, but the girl was allowed to escape. She ran  as fast as she could to the nearest guard, and told her story; the  alarm was given, and the wounded man was brought in. The young lady  was called upon shortly afterwards to identify one of the supposed  murderers, but she could not recognize the man as being of the party  who made the attack; nevertheless, the murderer's friends were afraid  of what she might remember, and made an attempt one night to carry her  off. Fortunately, it was frustrated, but from that time, until she  left Peshawar, it was considered necessary to keep a guard over the  house in which she lived.    From all this my readers may probably think that Peshawar, as I first  knew it, was not a desirable place of residence; but I was very happy  there. There was a good deal of excitement and adventure; I made many  friends; and, above all, I had, to me, the novel pleasure of being  with my father.    It was the custom in those days for the General commanding one of the  larger divisions to have under him, and in charge of the Head-Quarter  station, a senior officer styled Brigadier. Soon after I went to  Peshawar, Sydney Cotton[2] held this appointment, and remained in  it for many years, making a great reputation for himself during the  Mutiny, and being eventually appointed to the command of the division.  The two senior officers on my father's staff were Lieutenant Norman[3]  and Lieutenant Lumsden,[4] the former Deputy Assistant-Adjutant-General  and the latter Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-General. The high opinion  of them which my father had formed was subsequently justified by their  distinguished careers. Norman, with sixteen years' service, and at the  age of thirty-four, became Adjutant-General of the Army in India, and  a year or two later Secretary to Government in the Military Department.  He finished his Indian service as Military Member of Council. Lumsden  became Quartermaster-General, and afterwards Adjutant-General, the two  highest positions on the Indian staff.    There was a separate mess for all the staff officers, and I remember  a curious circumstance in connexion with that mess which, unless the  exception proves the rule, is strong evidence against the superstition  that thirteen is an unlucky number to sit down to dinner. On the 1st  January, 1853, thirteen of us dined together; eleven years after we  were all alive, nearly the whole of the party having taken part in the  suppression of the Mutiny, and five or six having been wounded.    From the time of my arrival until the autumn of 1853, nothing of  much importance occurred. I lived with my father, and acted as his  Aide-de-camp, while, at the same time, I did duty with the Artillery.  The 2nd Company, 2nd Battalion, to which I belonged, was composed of a  fine body of men, who had a grand reputation in the field, but, being  somewhat troublesome in quarters, had acquired the nickname of 'The  Devil's Own.' Because of the unusually good physique of the men, this  company was selected for conversion into a Mountain Battery, which it  was thought advisable to raise at that time. I was the only subaltern  with this battery for several months, and though my commanding officer  had no objection to my acting as A.D.C. to my father, he took good  care that I did my regimental duty strictly and regularly.    One very painful circumstance stamped itself on my memory. I was  obliged to be present at a flogging parade--the only one, I am glad to  say, I have ever had to attend, although the barbarous and degrading  custom of flogging in the army was not done away with until nearly  thirty years later.[5] A few years before I joined the service, the  number of lashes which might be given was limited to fifty, but even  under this restriction the sight was a horrible one to witness. The  parade to which I refer was ordered for the punishment of two men who  had been sentenced to fifty lashes each for selling their kits, and to  a certain term of imprisonment in addition. They were fine, handsome  young Horse Artillerymen, and it was hateful to see them thus treated.  Besides, one felt it was productive of harm rather than good, for it  tended to destroy the men's self-respect, and to make them completely  reckless. In this instance, no sooner had the two men been released  from prison than they committed the same offence again. They were a  second time tried by Court-Martial, and sentenced as before. How I  longed to have the power to remit the fifty lashes, for I felt that  selling their kits on this occasion was their way of showing their  resentment at the ignominious treatment they had been subjected to,  and of proving that flogging was powerless to prevent their repeating  the offence. A parade was ordered, as on the previous occasion. One  man was stripped to the waist, and tied to the wheel of a gun. The  finding and sentence of the Court-Martial were read out--a trumpeter  standing ready the while to inflict the punishment--when the  commanding officer, Major Robert Waller, instead of ordering him to  begin, to the intense relief of, I believe, every officer present,  addressed the prisoners, telling them of his distress at finding two  soldiers belonging to his troop brought up for corporal punishment  twice in a little more than six weeks, and adding that, however little  they deserved such leniency, if they would promise not to commit the  same offence again, and to behave better for the future, he would  remit the flogging part of the sentence. If the prisoners were not  happy, I was; but the clemency was evidently appreciated by them, for  they promised, and kept their words. I did not lose sight of these  two men for some years, and was always gratified to learn that their  conduct was uniformly satisfactory, and that they had become good,  steady soldiers.    The Commissioner, or chief civil authority, when I"]]]
