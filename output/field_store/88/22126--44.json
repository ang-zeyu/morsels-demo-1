He strongly advised that the bookcase  should be moved, and suggested that it would be better to place it  across that end of the room where the pianoforte then stood. They  examined it and found that it would easily admit of removal, being, in  fact, only the frame of a bookcase, and showing at the back the painted  panelling of the wall. Mr. Gaskell noted it as curious that all the  shelves were fixed and immovable except one at the end, which had been  fitted with the ordinary arrangement allowing its position to be altered  at will. My brother thought that the change would improve the appearance  of his rooms, besides being advantageous for the books, and gave  instructions to the college upholsterer to have the necessary work  carried out at once.    The two young men had resumed their musical studies, and had often  played the \"Areopagita\" and other music of Graziani since their return  to Oxford in the Autumn. They remarked, however, that the chair no  longer creaked during the _Gagliarda_--and, in fact, that no unusual  occurrence whatever attended its performance. At times they were almost  tempted to doubt the accuracy of their own remembrances, and to consider  as entirely mythical the mystery which had so much disturbed them in the  summer term. My brother had also pointed out to Mr. Gaskell my discovery  that the coat of arms on the outside of the music-book was identical  with that which his fancy portrayed on the musicians' gallery. He  readily admitted that he must at some time have noticed and afterwards  forgotten the blazon on the book, and that an unconscious reminiscence  of it had no doubt inspired his imagination in this instance. He rebuked  my brother for having agitated me unnecessarily by telling me at all of  so idle a tale; and was pleased to write a few lines to me at Worth  Maltravers, felicitating me on my shrewdness of perception, but speaking  banteringly of the whole matter.    On the evening of the 14th of November my brother and his friend were  sitting talking in the former's room. The position of the bookcase had  been changed on the morning of that day, and Mr. Gaskell had come round  to see how the books looked when placed at the end instead of at the  side of the room. He had applauded the new arrangement, and the young  men sat long over the fire, with a bottle of college port and a dish of  medlars which I had sent my brother from our famous tree in the Upper  Croft at Worth Maltravers. Later on they fell to music, and played a  variety of pieces, performing also the \"Areopagita\" suite. Mr. Gaskell  before he left complimented John on the improvement which the alteration  in the place of the bookcase had made in his room, saying, \"Not only  do the books in their present place very much enhance the general  appearance of the room, but the change seems to me to have affected also  a marked acoustical improvement. The oak panelling now exposed on the  side of the room has given a resonant property to the wall which is  peculiarly responsive to the tones of your violin. While you were  playing the _Gagliarda_ to-night, I could almost have imagined that  someone in an adjacent room was playing the same air with a _sordino_,  so distinct was the echo.\"    Shortly after this he left.    My brother partly undressed himself in his bedroom, which adjoined, and  then returning to his sitting-room, pulled the large wicker chair in  front of the fire, and sat there looking at the glowing coals, and  thinking perhaps of Miss Constance Temple. The night promised to be very  cold, and the wind whistled down the chimney, increasing the comfortable  sensation of the clear fire. He sat watching the ruddy reflection of the  firelight dancing on the panelled wall, when he noticed that a picture  placed where the end of the bookcase formerly stood was not truly hung,  and needed adjustment. A picture hung askew was particularly offensive  to his eyes, and he got up at once to alter it. He remembered as he went  up to it that at this precise spot four months ago he had lost sight  of the man's figure which he saw rise from the wicker chair, and at  the memory felt an involuntary shudder. This reminiscence probably  influenced his fancy also in another direction; for it seemed to him  that very faintly, as though played far off, and with the _sordino_,  he could hear the air of the _Gagliarda_. He put one hand behind the  picture to steady it, and as he did so his finger struck a very slight  projection in the wall. He pulled the picture a little to one side, and  saw that what he had touched was the back of a small hinge sunk in the  wall, and almost obliterated with many coats of paint. His curiosity  was excited, and he took a candle from the table and examined the wall  carefully. Inspection soon showed him another hinge a little further up,  and by degrees he perceived that one of the panels had been made at some  time in the past to open, and serve probably as the door of a cupboard.  At this point he assured me that a feverish anxiety to re-open this  cupboard door took possession of him, and that the intense excitement  filled his mind which we experience on the eve of a discovery which  we fancy may produce important results. He loosened the paint in the  cracks with a penknife, and attempted to press open the door; but his  instrument was not adequate to such a purpose, and all his efforts  remained ineffective. His excitement had now reached an overmastering  pitch; for he anticipated, though he knew not why, some strange  discovery to be made in this sealed cupboard. He looked round the room  for some weapon with which to force the door, and at length with his  penknife cut away sufficient wood at the joint to enable him to insert  the end of the poker in the hole. The clock in the New College Tower  struck one at the exact moment when with a sharp effort he thus forced  open the door. It appeared never to have had a fastening, but merely to  have been stuck fast by the accumulation of paint. As he bent it slowly  back upon the rusted hinges his heart beat so fast that he could  scarcely catch his breath, though he was conscious all the while of a  ludicrous aspect of his position, knowing that it was most probable  that the cavity within would be found empty. The cupboard was small but  very deep, and in the obscure light seemed at first to contain nothing  except a small heap of dust and cobwebs. His sense of disappointment was  keen as he thrust his hand into it, but changed again in a moment to  breathless interest on feeling something solid in what he had imagined  to be only an accumulation of mould and dirt. He snatched up a candle,  and holding this in one hand, with the other pulled out an object from  the cupboard and put it on the table, covered as it was with the curious  drapery of black and clinging cobwebs which I have seen adhering to  bottles of old wine. It lay there between the dish of medlars and the  decanter, veiled indeed with thick dust as with a mantle, but revealing  beneath it the shape and contour of a violin.          CHAPTER VII    John was excited at his discovery, and felt his thoughts confused in a  manner that I have often experienced myself on the unexpected receipt of  news interesting me deeply, whether for pleasure or pain. Yet at the  same time he was half amused at his own excitement, feeling that it  was childish to be moved over an event so simple as the finding of a  violin in an old cupboard. He soon collected himself and took up the  instrument, using great care, as he feared lest age should have rendered  the wood brittle or rotten. With some vigorous puffs of breath and a  little dusting with a handkerchief he removed the heavy outer coating  of cobwebs, and began to see more clearly the delicate curves of the  body and of the scroll. A few minutes' more gentle handling left the  instrument sufficiently clean to enable him to appreciate its chief  points. Its seclusion from the outer world, which the heavy accumulation  of dust proved to have been for many years, did not seem to have damaged  it in the least; and the fact of a chimney-flue passing through the wall  at no great distance had no doubt conduced to maintain the air in the  cupboard at an equable temperature. So far as he was able to judge, the  wood was as sound as when it left the maker's hands; but the strings  were of course broken, and curled up in little tangled knots. The body  was of a light-red colour, with a varnish of peculiar lustre and  softness. The neck seemed rather longer than ordinary, and the scroll  was remarkably bold and free.    The violin which my brother was in the habit of using was a fine  _Pressenda_, given to him on his fifteenth birthday by Mr. Thoresby, his  guardian. It was of that maker's later and best period, and a copy of  the Stradivarius model. John took this from its case and laid it side by  side with his new discovery, meaning to compare them for size and form.  He perceived at once that while the model of both was identical, the  superiority of the older violin in every detail was so marked as to  convince him that it was undoubtedly an instrument of exceptional value.  The extreme beauty of its varnish impressed him vividly, and though he  had never seen a genuine Stradivarius, he felt a conviction gradually  gaining on him that he stood in the presence of a masterpiece of that  great maker. On looking into the interior he found that surprisingly  little dust had penetrated into it, and by blowing through the  sound-holes he soon cleared it sufficiently to enable him to discern a  label. He put the candle close to him, and held the violin up so that  a little patch of light fell through the sound-hole on to the label.  His heart leapt with a violent pulsation as he read the characters,  \"_Antonius Stradiuarius Cremonensis faciebat_, 1704.\" Under "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14134"],[0,"Akbar, Emperor of India (#7)"],[1,"which does not  correspond with his usual benevolence, but still is characteristic of  the tendency of his mind. In this case a convincing demonstration  appeared to him so necessary that some individuals would have to  suffer for it. Accordingly in the year 1579 he caused twenty infants  to be taken from their parents in return for a compensation and  brought up under the care of silent nurses in a remote spot in which  no word should be spoken. After four years it was proved that as many  of these unhappy children as were still alive were entirely dumb and  possessed no trace of a predisposition for Islam.[35] Later the  children are said to have learned to speak with extraordinary  difficulty as was to be expected.      [Footnote 35: J.T. Wheeler, IV, I, 174; Noer, I, 511, 512. A familiar    classical parallel to this incident is the experiment recorded by    Herodotus (II, 2) which the Egyptian king Psammetich is said to have    performed with two infants. It is related that after being shut up in    a goat's stable for two years separated from all human intercourse    these children repeatedly cried out the alleged Phrygian word [Greek:    bekhos], \"bread,\" which in reality was probably simply an imitation of    the bleating of the goats. Compare Edward B. Tyler, _Researches into    the Early History of Mankind_. 2nd edition, (London, 1870), page 81:    \"It is a very trite remark that there is nothing absolutely incredible    in the story and that _Bek, bek_ is a good imitative word for bleating    as in [Greek: blechhaomai, mekhaomai], _bloeken, meckern_, etc.\"    Farther on we find the account of a similar attempt made by James IV    of Scotland as well as the literature with regard to other historical    and legendary precedents of this sort in both Orient and Occident.]    Akbar's repugnance to Islam developed into a complete revulsion  against every thing connected with this narrow religion and made the  great Emperor petty-souled in this particular. The decrees were dated  from the death of Mohammed and no longer from the Hejra (the flight  from Mecca to Medina). Books written in Arabic, the language of the  Koran were given the lowest place in the imperial library. The  knowledge of Arabic was prohibited, even the sounds characteristically  belonging to this language were avoided.[36] Where formerly according  to ancient tradition had stood the word _Bismilahi_, \"in the name of  God,\" there now appeared the old war cry _Allahu akbar_ \"God is  great,\" which came into use the more generally--on coins, documents,  etc.--the more the courtiers came to reverse the sense of the slogan  and to apply to it the meaning, \"Akbar is God.\"      [Footnote 36: Noer, II, 324, 325. Beards which the Koran commanded to    be worn Akbar even refused to allow in his presence. M. Elphinstone,    525; G.B. Malleson, 177.]    Before I enter into the Emperor's assumption of this flattery and his  conception of the imperial dignity as conferred by the grace of God, I  must speak of the interesting attempts of the Jesuits to win over to  Christianity the most powerful ruler of the Orient.    As early as in the spring of 1578 a Portuguese Jesuit who worked among  the Bengals as a missionary appeared at the imperial court and pleased  Akbar especially because he got the better of the Ulemas in  controversy. Two years later Akbar sent a very polite letter to the  Provincial of the Jesuit order in Goa, requesting him to send two  Fathers in order that Akbar himself might be instructed \"in their  faith and its perfection.\" It is easy to imagine how gladly the  Provincial assented to this demand and how carefully he proceeded with  the selection of the fathers who were to be sent away with such great  expectations. As gifts to the Emperor the Jesuits brought a Bible in  four languages and pictures of Christ and the Virgin Mary, and to  their great delight when Akbar received them he laid the Bible upon  his head and kissed the two pictures as a sign of reverence.[37]      [Footnote 37: J.T. Wheeler, IV, I,162; Noer, I, 481.]    In the interesting work of the French Jesuit Du Jarric, published in  1611, we possess very detailed accounts of the operations of these  missionaries who were honorably received at Akbar's court and who were  invited to take up their residence in the imperial palace. The evening  assemblies in the 'Ibadat Khana' in Fathpur Sikri at once gave the  shrewd Jesuits who were schooled in dialectics, an opportunity to  distinguish themselves before the Emperor who himself presided over  this Religious Parliament in which Christians, Jews, Mohammedans,  Brahmans, Buddhists and Parsees debated with each other. Abul Fazl  speaks with enthusiasm in the _Akbarname_ of the wisdom and zealous  faith of Father Aquaviva, the leader of this Jesuit mission, and  relates how he offered to walk into a fiery furnace with a New  Testament in his hand if the Mullahs would do the same with the Koran  in their hand, but that the Mohammedan priests withdrew in terror  before this test by fire. It is noteworthy in this connection that the  Jesuits at Akbar's court received a warning from their superiors not  to risk such rash experiments which might be induced by the devil with  the view of bringing shame upon Christianity.[38] The superiors were  apparently well informed with regard to the intentions of the devil.      [Footnote 38: J.T. Wheeler, IV, I, 165, note, 47; M. Elphinstone, 523,    note 8; G.B. Malleson, 162.]    In conversation with the Jesuits Akbar proved to be favorably inclined  towards many of the Christian doctrines and met his guests half way in  every manner possible. They had permission to erect a hospital and a  chapel and to establish Christian worship in the latter for the  benefit of the Portuguese in that vicinity. Akbar himself occasionally  took part in this service kneeling with bared head, which, however,  did not hinder him from joining also in the Mohammedan ritual or even  the Brahman religious practices of the Rajput women in his harem. He  had his second son Murad instructed by the Jesuits in the Portuguese  language and in the Christian faith.    The Jesuits on their side pushed energetically toward their goal and  did not scorn to employ flattery in so far as to draw a parallel  between the Emperor and Christ, but no matter how slyly the fathers  proceeded in the accomplishment of their plans Akbar was always a  match for them. In spite of all concessions with regard to the  excellence and credibility of the Christian doctrines the Emperor  never seemed to be entirely satisfied. Du Jarric \"complains bitterly  of his obstinacy and remarks that the restless intellect of this man  could never be quieted by one answer but must constantly make further  inquiry.\"[39] The clever historian of Islam makes the following  comment: \"Bad, very bad;--perhaps he would not even be satisfied with  the seven riddles of the universe of the latest natural science.\"[40]      [Footnote 39: In Noer, I, 485.]      [Footnote 40: A. Mueller, II, 420 n.]    To every petition and importunity of the Jesuits to turn to  Christianity Akbar maintained a firm opposition. A second and third  embassy which the order at Goa sent out in the nineties of the  sixteenth century, also labored in vain for Akbar's conversion in  spite of the many evidences of favor shown by the Emperor. One of the  last Jesuits to come, Jerome Xavier of Navarre, is said to have been  induced by the Emperor to translate the four Gospels into Persian  which was the language of the Mohammedan court of India. But Akbar  never thought of allowing himself to be baptized, nor could he  consider it seriously from political motives as well as from reasons  of personal conviction. A man who ordered himself to be officially  declared the highest authority in matters of faith--to be sure not so  much in order to found an imperial papacy in his country as to guard  his empire from an impending religious war--at any rate a man who saw  how the prosperity of his reign proceeded from his own personal  initiative in every respect, such a man could countenance no will  above his own nor subject himself to any pangs of conscience. To  recognize the Pope as highest authority and simply to recognize as  objective truth a finally determined system in the realm in which he  had spent day and night in a hot pursuit after a clearer vision, was  for Akbar an absolute impossibility.    Then too Akbar could not but see through the Jesuits although he  appreciated and admired many points about them. Their rigid dogmatism,  their intolerance and inordinate ambition could leave him no doubt  that if they once arose to power the activity of the Ulemas, once by  good fortune overthrown, would be again resumed by them to a stronger  and more dangerous degree. It is also probable that Akbar, who saw and  heard everything, had learned of the horrors of the Inquisition at  Goa. Moreover, the clearness of Akbar's vision for the realities of  national life had too often put him on his guard to permit him to look  upon the introduction of Christianity, however highly esteemed by him  personally, as a blessing for India. He had broken the power of Islam  in India; to overthrow in like manner the second great religion of his  empire, Brahmanism, to which the great majority of his subjects clung  with body and soul, and then in place of both existing religions to  introduce a third foreign religion inimically opposed to them--such a  procedure would have hurled India into an irremediable confusion and  destroyed at one blow the prosperity of the land which had been  brought about by the ceaseless efforts of a lifetime. For of course it  was not the aim of the Jesuits simply to win Akbar personally to  Christianity but they wished to see their religion made the state  religion of this great empire.    As has been already suggested, submission to Christianity would also  have been opposed "]]]
