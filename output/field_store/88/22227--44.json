The beginning of the poem he praised with great generosity: he even  found the idea original and effective. But that the end of it, like the  Rhine, was very insignificant, proved, in his opinion, the author's  want of invention; he was without genius, etc. This was an excellent  opportunity to have said something clever.    Meanwhile he was haunted by the idea--he should like to possess such a  pair of spectacles himself; then, perhaps, by using them circumspectly,  one would be able to look into people's hearts, which, he thought, would  be far more interesting than merely to see what was to happen next year;  for that we should all know in proper time, but the other never.    \"I can now,\" said he to himself, \"fancy the whole row of ladies and  gentlemen sitting there in the front row; if one could but see into  their hearts--yes, that would be a revelation--a sort of bazar. In that  lady yonder, so strangely dressed, I should find for certain a large  milliner's shop; in that one the shop is empty, but it wants cleaning  plain enough. But there would also be some good stately shops among  them. Alas!\" sighed he, \"I know one in which all is stately; but there  sits already a spruce young shopman, which is the only thing that's  amiss in the whole shop. All would be splendidly decked out, and we  should hear, 'Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in; here you will find all  you please to want.' Ah! I wish to Heaven I could walk in and take a  trip right through the hearts of those present!\"    And behold! to the Shoes of Fortune this was the cue; the whole man  shrunk together and a most uncommon journey through the hearts of the  front row of spectators, now began. The first heart through which he  came, was that of a middle-aged lady, but he instantly fancied himself  in the room of the \"Institution for the cure of the crooked and  deformed,\" where casts of mis-shapen limbs are displayed in naked  reality on the wall. Yet there was this difference, in the institution  the casts were taken at the entry of the patient; but here they were  retained and guarded in the heart while the sound persons went away.  They were, namely, casts of female friends, whose bodily or mental  deformities were here most faithfully preserved.    With the snake-like writhings of an idea he glided into another female  heart; but this seemed to him like a large holy fane. [*] The white dove of  innocence fluttered over the altar. How gladly would he have sunk upon  his knees; but he must away to the next heart; yet he still heard the  pealing tones of the organ, and he himself seemed to have become a newer  and a better man; he felt unworthy to tread the neighboring sanctuary  which a poor garret, with a sick bed-rid mother, revealed. But God's  warm sun streamed through the open window; lovely roses nodded from  the wooden flower-boxes on the roof, and two sky-blue birds sang  rejoicingly, while the sick mother implored God's richest blessings on  her pious daughter.         * temple      He now crept on hands and feet through a butcher's shop; at least on  every side, and above and below, there was nought but flesh. It was the  heart of a most respectable rich man, whose name is certain to be found  in the Directory.    He was now in the heart of the wife of this worthy gentleman. It was an  old, dilapidated, mouldering dovecot. The husband's portrait was used as  a weather-cock, which was connected in some way or other with the doors,  and so they opened and shut of their own accord, whenever the stern old  husband turned round.    Hereupon he wandered into a boudoir formed entirely of mirrors, like  the one in Castle Rosenburg; but here the glasses magnified to an  astonishing degree. On the floor, in the middle of the room, sat, like a  Dalai-Lama, the insignificant \"Self\" of the person, quite confounded at  his own greatness. He then imagined he had got into a needle-case full  of pointed needles of every size.    \"This is certainly the heart of an old maid,\" thought he. But he was  mistaken. It was the heart of a young military man; a man, as people  said, of talent and feeling.    In the greatest perplexity, he now came out of the last heart in the  row; he was unable to put his thoughts in order, and fancied that his  too lively imagination had run away with him.    \"Good Heavens!\" sighed he. \"I have surely a disposition to madness--'tis  dreadfully hot here; my blood boils in my veins and my head is burning  like a coal.\" And he now remembered the important event of the evening  before, how his head had got jammed in between the iron railings of the  hospital. \"That's what it is, no doubt,\" said he. \"I must do something  in time: under such circumstances a Russian bath might do me good. I  only wish I were already on the upper bank.\" [*]         *In these Russian (vapor) baths the person extends himself       on a bank or form, and as he gets accustomed to the heat,       moves to another higher up towards the ceiling, where, of       course, the vapor is warmest. In this manner he ascends       gradually to the highest.    And so there he lay on the uppermost bank in the vapor-bath; but with  all his clothes on, in his boots and galoshes, while the hot drops fell  scalding from the ceiling on his face.    \"Holloa!\" cried he, leaping down. The bathing attendant, on his side,  uttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath, a man  completely dressed.    The other, however, retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to  him, \"'Tis a bet, and I have won it!\" But the first thing he did as soon  as he got home, was to have a large blister put on his chest and back to  draw out his madness.    The next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back; and, excepting  the fright, that was all that he had gained by the Shoes of Fortune.      V. Metamorphosis of the Copying-Clerk    The watchman, whom we have certainly not forgotten, thought meanwhile  of the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital; he now  went to fetch them; and as neither the lieutenant, nor anybody else in  the street, claimed them as his property, they were delivered over to  the police-office.*    *As on the continent, in all law and police practices nothing is verbal,  but any circumstance, however trifling, is reduced to writing, the  labor, as well as the number of papers that thus accumulate, is  enormous. In a police-office, consequently, we find copying-clerks among  many other scribes of various denominations, of which, it seems, our  hero was one.      \"Why, I declare the Shoes look just like my own,\" said one of the  clerks, eying the newly-found treasure, whose hidden powers, even he,  sharp as he was, was not able to discover. \"One must have more than  the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other,\" said he,  soliloquizing; and putting, at the same time, the galoshes in search of  an owner, beside his own in the corner.    \"Here, sir!\" said one of the men, who panting brought him a tremendous  pile of papers.    The copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man about the  reports and legal documents in question; but when he had finished, and  his eye fell again on the Shoes, he was unable to say whether those to  the left or those to the right belonged to him. \"At all events it must  be those which are wet,\" thought he; but this time, in spite of his  cleverness, he guessed quite wrong, for it was just those of Fortune  which played as it were into his hands, or rather on his feet. And why,  I should like to know, are the police never to be wrong? So he put them  on quickly, stuck his papers in his pocket, and took besides a few under  his arm, intending to look them through at home to make the necessary  notes. It was noon; and the weather, that had threatened rain, began  to clear up, while gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. \"A  little trip to Fredericksburg would do me no great harm,\" thought he;  \"for I, poor beast of burden that I am, have so much to annoy me, that I  don't know what a good appetite is. 'Tis a bitter crust, alas! at which  I am condemned to gnaw!\"    Nobody could be more steady or quiet than this young man; we therefore  wish him joy of the excursion with all our heart; and it will certainly  be beneficial for a person who leads so sedentary a life. In the park  he met a friend, one of our young poets, who told him that the following  day he should set out on his long-intended tour.    \"So you are going away again!\" said the clerk. \"You are a very free  and happy being; we others are chained by the leg and held fast to our  desk.\"    \"Yes; but it is a chain, friend, which ensures you the blessed bread  of existence,\" answered the poet. \"You need feel no care for the coming  morrow: when you are old, you receive a pension.\"    \"True,\" said the clerk, shrugging his shoulders; \"and yet you are  the better off. To sit at one's ease and poetise--that is a pleasure;  everybody has something agreeable to say to you, and you are always your  own master. No, friend, you should but try what it is to sit from one  year's end to the other occupied with and judging the most trivial  matters.\"    The poet shook his head, the copying-clerk did the same. Each one kept  to his own opinion, and so they separated.    \"It's a strange race, those poets!\" said the clerk, who was very fond of  soliloquizing. \"I should like some day, just for a trial, to take such  nature upon me, and be a poet myself; I am very sure I should make  no such miserable verses as the others. Today, methinks, is a most  delicious day for a poet. Nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening  into life. The air is so unusually clear, the clouds sail on so  buoyantly, and from the green herbage a fragrance is exhaled that fills  me with delight. For many a year have I not felt as at this moment.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#7)"],[1," dreams  in one. And in the morning he sent for all the wise men of Egypt, and  told to them his dreams; but there was not a man who could give the  meaning of them. And the king was troubled, for he felt that the dreams  had some meaning which it was important for him to know.    Then suddenly the chief butler who was by the king's table remembered  his own dream in the prison two years before, and remembered, too, the  young man who had told its meaning so exactly. And he said:    \"I do remember my faults this day. Two years ago king Pharaoh was angry  with his servants, with me and the chief baker; and he sent us to the  prison. While we were in the prison, one night each of us dreamed a  dream; and the next day a young man in the prison, a Hebrew from the  land of Canaan, told us what our dreams meant; and in three days they  came true, just as the young Hebrew had said. I think that if this young  man is in the prison still, he could tell the king the meaning of his  dreams.\"    You notice that the butler spoke of Joseph as \"a Hebrew.\" The people of  Israel, to whom Joseph belonged, were called Hebrews as well as  Israelites. The word Hebrew means, \"One who crossed over,\" and it was  given to the Israelites because Abraham, their father, had come from a  land on the other side of the great river Euphrates, and had crossed  over the river on his way to Canaan.    Then king Pharaoh sent in haste to the prison for Joseph; and Joseph was  taken out, and he was dressed in new garments, and was led in to Pharaoh  in the palace. And Pharaoh said:    \"I have dreamed a dream; and there is no one who can tell what it  means. And I have been told that you have power to understand dreams and  what they mean.\"    And Joseph answered Pharaoh:    \"The power is not in me; but God will give Pharaoh a good answer. What  is the dream that the king has dreamed?\"    \"In my first dream,\" said Pharaoh, \"I was standing by the river: and I  saw seven fat and handsome cows come up from the river to feed in the  grass. And while they were feeding, seven other cows followed them up  from the river, very thin, and poor, and lean--such miserable creatures  as I had never seen before. And the seven lean cows ate up the seven fat  cows; and after they had eaten them up, they were as lean and miserable  as before. Then I awoke.    \"And I fell asleep again, and dreamed again. In my second dream, I saw  seven heads of grain growing up on one stalk, large, and strong, and  good. And then seven heads came up after them, that were thin, and poor,  and withered. And the seven thin heads swallowed up the seven good  heads; and afterward were as poor and withered as before.    \"And I told these two dreams to all the wise men, and there is no one  who can explain them. Can you tell me what these dreams mean?\"    And Joseph said to the king:    \"The two dreams have the same meaning. God has been showing to king  Pharaoh what he will do in this land. The seven good cows mean seven  years, and the seven good heads of grain mean the same seven years. The  seven lean cows and the seven thin heads of grain also mean seven years.  The good cows and the good grain mean seven years of plenty, and the  seven thin cows and thin heads of grain mean seven poor years. There are  coming upon the land of Egypt seven years of such plenty as have never  been seen; when the fields shall bring greater crops than ever before;  and after those years shall come seven years when the fields shall bring  no crops at all. And then for seven years there shall be such need, that  the years of plenty will be forgotten, for the people will have nothing  to eat.\"    [Illustration: _\"The two dreams have the same meaning\"_]    \"Now, let king Pharaoh find some man who is able and wise, and let him  set this man to rule over the land. And during the seven years of  plenty, let a part of the crops be put away for the years of need. If  this shall be done, then when the years of need come, there will be  plenty of food for all the people, and no one will suffer, for all will  have enough.\"    And king Pharaoh said to Joseph: \"Since God has shown you all this,  there is no other man as wise as you. I will appoint you to do this  work, and to rule over the land of Egypt. All the people shall be under  you; only on the throne of Egypt I will be above you.\"    And Pharaoh took from his own hand the ring which held his seal, and put  on Joseph's hand, so that he could sign for the king, and seal in the  king's place. And he dressed Joseph in robes of fine linen, and put  around his neck a gold chain. And he made Joseph ride in a chariot which  was next in rank to his own. And they cried out before Joseph, \"Bow the  knee.\" And thus Joseph was ruler over all the land of Egypt.        THE STORY OF THE MONEY IN THE SACKS    When Joseph was made ruler over the land of Egypt, he did just as he had  always done. It was not Joseph's way to sit down, to rest and enjoy  himself, and make others wait on him. He found his work at once, and  began to do it faithfully and thoroughly. He went out over all the land  of Egypt, and saw how rich and abundant were the fields of grain, giving  much more than the people could use for their own needs. He told the  people not to waste it, but to save it for the coming time of need.    And he called upon the people to give him for the king one bushel of  grain out of every five, to be stored up. The people brought their  grain, after taking for themselves as much as they needed, and Joseph  stored it up in great storehouses in the cities; so much at last that no  one could keep account of it.    The king of Egypt gave a wife to Joseph from the noble young women of  his kingdom. Her name was Asenath; and to Joseph and his wife God gave  two sons. The oldest son he named Manasseh, a word which means \"Making  to Forget.\"    \"For,\" said Joseph, \"God has made me to forget all my troubles and my  toil as a slave.\"    The second son he named Ephraim, a word that means \"Fruitful.\"  \"Because,\" said Joseph, \"God has not only made the land fruitful; but he  has made me fruitful in the land of my troubles.\"    The seven years of plenty soon passed by, and then came the years of  need. In all the lands around people were hungry, and there was no food  for them to eat; but in the land of Egypt everybody had enough. Most of  the people soon used up the grain that they had saved; many had saved  none at all, and they all cried to the king to help them.    \"Go to Joseph!\" said king Pharaoh, \"and do whatever he tells you to do.\"    Then the people came to Joseph, and Joseph opened the storehouses, and  sold to the people all the grain that they wished to buy. And not only  the people of Egypt came to buy grain, but people of all the lands  around as well, for there was great need and famine everywhere. And the  need was as great in the land of Canaan, where Jacob lived, as in other  lands. Jacob was rich in flocks and cattle, and gold and silver, but his  fields gave no grain, and there was danger that his family and his  people would starve. And Jacob--who was now called Israel also--heard  that there was food in Egypt and he said to his sons: \"Why do you look  at each other, asking what to do to find food? I have been told that  there is grain in Egypt. Go down to that land, and take money with you,  and bring grain, so that we may have bread, and may live.\"    Then the ten older brothers of Joseph went down to the land of Egypt.  They rode upon asses, for horses were not much used in those times, and  they brought money with them. But Jacob would not let Benjamin, Joseph's  younger brother, go with them, for he was all the more dear to his  father, now that Joseph was no longer with him; and Jacob feared that  harm might come to him.    Then Joseph's brothers came to Joseph to buy food. They did not know  him, grown up to be a man, dressed as a prince, and seated on a throne.  Joseph was now nearly forty years old, and it had been almost  twenty-three years since they had sold him. But Joseph knew them all, as  soon as he saw them. He wished to be sharp and stern with them, not  because he hated them; but because he wished to see what their spirit  was, and whether they were as selfish, and cruel, and wicked as they had  been in other days.    They came before him, and bowed, with their faces to the ground. Then,  no doubt, Joseph thought of the dream that had come to him while he was  a boy, of his brothers' sheaves bending down around his sheaf. He spoke  to them as a stranger, as if he did not understand their language, and  he had their words explained to him in the language of Egypt.    \"Who are you? And from what place do you come?\" said Joseph, in a harsh,  stern manner.    They answered him very meekly: \"We have come from the land of Canaan to  buy food.\"    \"No,\" said Joseph, \"I know what you have come for. You have come as  spies, to see how helpless the land is, so that you can bring an army  against us, and make war on us.\"    \"No, no,\" said Joseph's ten brothers. \"We are no spies. We are the sons  of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan; and we have come for food,  because we have none at home.\"    \"You say that you are the sons of one man, who is your father? Is he  living? Have you any more brothers? Tell me all about yourselves.\"    And they said: \"Our father is an old man in Canaan. We did have a  younger brother, but he was lost; and we have one brother still, who is  the youngest of all, but his father could not spare him to come with  us.\"    \"No,\" said Joseph. \"You are not good, honest men. You are spies. I  shall put you all in prison, except one of you; and he shall go and  bring that youngest brother of yours; and when I see him, then I will  believe that you tell the truth.\"    So Joseph put all the ten men in prison, and kept them under guard for  three days; then he sent for them again. They did not know that he could  understand their language, "]]]
