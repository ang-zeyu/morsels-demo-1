Can you take courage enough to rise and place yourself in the spot  so seeming to be occupied, and convince yourself of the illusion?\" The  poor man sighed, and shook his head negatively. \"Well,\" said the doctor,  \"we will try the experiment otherwise.\" Accordingly, he rose from his  chair by the bedside, and placing himself between the two half-drawn  curtains at the foot of the bed, indicated as the place occupied by the  apparition, asked if the spectre was still visible? \"Not entirely so,\"  replied the patient, \"because your person is betwixt him and me; but I  observe his skull peering above your shoulder.\"    It is alleged the man of science started on the instant, despite  philosophy, on receiving an answer ascertaining, with such minuteness,  that the ideal spectre was close to his own person. He resorted to other  means of investigation and cure, but with equally indifferent success.  The patient sunk into deeper and deeper dejection, and died in the same  distress of mind in which he had spent the latter months of his life;  and his case remains a melancholy instance of the power of imagination  to kill the body, even when its fantastic terrors cannot overcome the  intellect, of the unfortunate persons who suffer under them. The  patient, in the present case, sunk under his malady; and the  circumstances of his singular disorder remaining concealed, he did not,  by his death and last illness, lose any of his well-merited reputation  for prudence and sagacity which had attended him during the whole course  of his life.    Having added these two remarkable instances to the general train of  similar facts quoted by Ferriar, Hibbert, and other writers who have  more recently considered the subject, there can, we think, be little  doubt of the proposition, that the external organs may, from various  causes, become so much deranged as to make false representations to the  mind; and that, in such cases, men, in the literal sense, really _see_  the empty and false forms and _hear_ the ideal sounds which, in a more  primitive state of society, are naturally enough referred to the action  of demons or disembodied spirits. In such unhappy cases the patient is  intellectually in the condition of a general whose spies have been  bribed by the enemy, and who must engage himself in the difficult and  delicate task of examining and correcting, by his own powers of  argument, the probability of the reports which are too inconsistent to  be trusted to.    But there is a corollary to this proposition, which is worthy of notice.  The same species of organic derangement which, as a continued habit of  his deranged vision, presented the subject of our last tale with the  successive apparitions of his cat, his gentleman-usher, and the fatal  skeleton, may occupy, for a brief or almost momentary space, the vision  of men who are otherwise perfectly clear-sighted. Transitory deceptions  are thus presented to the organs which, when they occur to men of  strength of mind and of education, give way to scrutiny, and their  character being once investigated, the true takes the place of the  unreal representation. But in ignorant times those instances in which  any object is misrepresented, whether through the action of the senses,  or of the imagination, or the combined influence of both, for however  short a space of time, may be admitted as direct evidence of a  supernatural apparition; a proof the more difficult to be disputed if  the phantom has been personally witnessed by a man of sense and  estimation, who, perhaps satisfied in the general as to the actual  existence of apparitions, has not taken time or trouble to correct his  first impressions. This species of deception is so frequent that one of  the greatest poets of the present time answered a lady who asked him if  he believed in ghosts:--\"No, madam; I have seen too many myself.\" I may  mention one or two instances of the kind, to which no doubt can be  attached.    The first shall be the apparition of Maupertuis to a brother professor  in the Royal Society of Berlin.    This extraordinary circumstance appeared in the Transactions of the  Society, but is thus stated by M. Thiebault in his \"Recollections of  Frederick the Great and the Court of Berlin.\" It is necessary to premise  that M. Gleditsch, to whom the circumstance happened, was a botanist of  eminence, holding the professorship of natural philosophy at Berlin, and  respected as a man of an habitually serious, simple, and tranquil  character.    A short time after the death of Maupertuis,[2] M. Gleditsch being  obliged to traverse the hall in which the Academy held its sittings,  having some arrangements to make in the cabinet of natural history,  which was under his charge, and being willing to complete them on the  Thursday before the meeting, he perceived, on entering the hall, the  apparition of M. de Maupertuis, upright and stationary, in the first  angle on his left hand, having his eyes fixed on him. This was about  three o'clock, afternoon. The professor of natural philosophy was too  well acquainted with physical science to suppose that his late  president, who had died at Bale, in the family of Messrs. Bernoullie,  could have found his way back to Berlin in person. He regarded the  apparition in no other light than as a phantom produced by some  derangement of his own proper organs. M. Gleditsch went to his own  business, without stopping longer than to ascertain exactly the  appearance of that object. But he related the vision to his brethren,  and assured them that it was as defined and perfect as the actual person  of Maupertuis could have presented. When it is recollected that  Maupertuis died at a distance from Berlin, once the scene of his  triumphs--overwhelmed by the petulant ridicule of Voltaire, and out of  favour with Frederick, with whom to be ridiculous was to be  worthless--we can hardly wonder at the imagination even of a man of  physical science calling up his Eidolon in the hall of his former  greatness.    [Footnote 2: Long the president of the Berlin Academy, and much favoured  by Frederick II., till he was overwhelmed by the ridicule of Voltaire.  He retired, in a species of disgrace, to his native country of  Switzerland, and died there shortly afterwards.]    The sober-minded professor did not, however, push his investigation to  the point to which it was carried by a gallant soldier, from whose mouth  a particular friend of the author received the following circumstances  of a similar story.    Captain C---- was a native of Britain, but bred in the Irish Brigade. He  was a man of the most dauntless courage, which he displayed in some  uncommonly desperate adventures during the first years of the French  Revolution, being repeatedly employed by the royal family in very  dangerous commissions. After the King's death he came over to England,  and it was then the following circumstance took place.    Captain C---- was a Catholic, and, in his hour of adversity at least,  sincerely attached to the duties of his religion. His confessor was a  clergyman who was residing as chaplain to a man of rank in the west of  England, about four miles from the place where Captain C---- lived. On  riding over one morning to see this gentleman, his penitent had the  misfortune to find him very ill from a dangerous complaint. He retired  in great distress and apprehension of his friend's life, and the feeling  brought back upon him many other painful and disagreeable recollections.  These occupied him till the hour of retiring to bed, when, to his great  astonishment, he saw in the room the figure of the absent confessor. He  addressed it, but received no answer--the eyes alone were impressed by  the appearance. Determined to push the matter to the end, Captain C----  advanced on the phantom, which appeared to retreat gradually before him.  In this manner he followed it round the bed, when it seemed to sink down  on an elbow-chair, and remain there in a sitting posture. To ascertain  positively the nature of the apparition, the soldier himself sate down  on the same chair, ascertaining thus, beyond question, that the whole  was illusion; yet he owned that, had his friend died about the same  time, he would not well have known what name to give to his vision. But  as the confessor recovered, and, in Dr. Johnson's phrase, \"nothing came  of it,\" the incident was only remarkable as showing that men of the  strongest nerves are not exempted from such delusions.    Another illusion of the same nature we have the best reason for vouching  as a fact, though, for certain reasons, we do not give the names of the  parties. Not long after the death of a late illustrious poet, who had  filled, while living, a great station in the eye of the public, a  literary friend, to whom the deceased had been well known, was engaged,  during the darkening twilight of an autumn evening, in perusing one of  the publications which professed to detail the habits and opinions of  the distinguished individual who was now no more. As the reader had  enjoyed the intimacy of the deceased to a considerable degree, he was  deeply interested in the publication, which contained some particulars  relating to himself and other friends. A visitor was sitting in the  apartment, who was also engaged in reading. Their sitting-room opened  into an entrance-hall, rather fantastically fitted up with articles of  armour, skins of wild animals, and the like. It was when laying down his  book, and passing into this hall, through which the moon was beginning  to shine, that the individual of whom I speak saw, right before him, and  in a standing posture, the exact representation of his departed friend,  whose recollection had been so strongly brought to his imagination. He  stopped for a single moment, so as to notice the wonderful accuracy with  which fancy had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#7)"],[1,"ancially;  but some of the original inhabitants still remain to show in the future  that they have learned wisdom from their past troubles, brought on  principally by their mad haste to get rich too quickly.    During our stay at Johannesburg we made an expedition to Pretoria in  order to see our host and other friends, who were still on bail there,  awaiting their trial, and also to visit the seat of the Boer Government.  By these remarkable State railways the short journey of thirty-two miles  occupied three hours. We passed one very large Boer laager, or military  camp, on the line, which looked imposing enough in the bright sunlight,  with its shining array of white-tarpaulin-covered waggons; companies of  mounted burghers, armed to the teeth, and sitting their ragged but  well-bred ponies as if glued to the saddle, were to be seen galloping to  and fro. Although the teeth of the enemy had been drawn for the present,  the Boers were evidently determined to keep up a martial display. As  Pretoria was approached the country became very pretty: low hills and  many trees, including lovely weeping-willows, appeared on the landscape,  and away towards the horizon was situated many a snug little farm;  running streams caught the rays of the sun, and really rich herbage  supplied the pasture for herds of fat cattle. The town itself did not  prove specially interesting. An imposing space called Church Square was  pointed out to us with great pride by the Dutch gentleman who kindly did  cicerone. There we saw the little primitive \"dopper\" church where the  President always worshipped, overshadowed and dwarfed by the magnificent  Houses of Parliament, built since the Transvaal acquired riches, and by  the no less grand Government Offices. As we were standing before the  latter, after the fashion of tourists, our guide suddenly became very  excited, and told us we were really in good luck, for the President was  just about to leave his office on his return home for his midday meal.  In a few minutes the old gentleman emerged, guarded by four armed  burghers, and passed rapidly into his carriage. We took a good look at  this remarkable personage. Stout in figure, with a venerable white  beard, in a somewhat worn frock-coat and a rusty old black silk hat,  President Kruger did not look the stern dictator of his little kingdom  which in truth he was. Our Dutch friend told us Oom Paul was in the  habit of commencing work at 5 a.m., and that he transacted business,  either at his house or in the Government Offices, with short  intermissions, until 5 p.m. Simply worshipped by his burghers, he was on  a small scale, and in his ignorant fashion, a man of iron like Bismarck,  notably in his strong will and in the way in which he imposed the same  on his countrymen. The extent of his personal influence could be gauged  when one considered that his mere orders had restrained his  undisciplined soldier-burghers, who, irritated by being called away from  their peaceful existences, maddened by the loss of some of their number  who fell in the fighting, and elated by their easy victory, were  thirsting to shoot down the leaders of the Raid, as they stood, in the  market-square at Krugersdorp. The state of the Boer Government at that  time added to the President's difficulties. He was hampered by the  narrowest--minded Volksraad (Parliament) imaginable, who resented tooth  and nail even the most necessary concessions to the Uitlanders; he was  surrounded by corrupt officials, most of whom were said to be implicated  in the late rebellion; he was the head of a community which was known to  be split up into several sections, owing to acute religious disputes;  and yet he contrived, at seventy-one years of age, to outwit the 60,000  Uitlanders at Johannesburg, and to present his rotten republic as a  model of all that was excellent and high-minded to the world at large.  At the same time he compelled his burghers to forget their own  differences, as they hurled defiance at the common foe. It seems to be a  truism that it requires a Boer to rule a Boer; and in some ways the  mantle of President Kruger would appear to have descended in our days  upon General Louis Botha. According to all accounts, his will is now law  to the ignorant back Veldt Boers, although his guiding principles savour  more of the big stick than of the spoon-feeding system. Undoubtedly  loyal to England, he bids fair in the future to help found a nation,  based upon the union of British and Boer, inheriting their traditions,  cultivating their ideals, and pursuing their common ends.    But this Utopia seemed far away in 1896, and it was, alas! destined that  many lives should be laid down, and much treasure expended, before its  advent. For the moment lamentations were rife in Johannesburg, and at  many a dinner-party unprofitable discussions raged as to what would have  happened had Dr. Jameson entered the city. On this point no one could  agree. Some people said the town could have been starved out in a few  days, and the water-supply cut off immediately; others asserted that the  Boers were in reality overawed by Dr. Jameson's name and prestige, and  would have been glad to make terms. The practical spirits opined that  the only thing which would have saved the inhabitants in any case was  the tame ending which actually came about--namely, the High  Commissioner's intervention coupled with President Kruger's moderation  and wisdom in allowing England to punish her own irregular soldiers. The  more one heard of the whole affair, the more it seemed to resemble a  scene out of a comic opera. The only people at Johannesburg who had  derived any advantage from the confusion were several hitherto unknown  military commanders, who had proudly acquired the title of Colonel, and  had promptly named a body of horse after themselves. During the days  before the final fiasco these leaders used to make short detours round  the town in full regimentals, and finally fill up the time by being  photographed in groups. Mercifully, as it turned out, they were not  ready for active service when Dr. Jameson was reported at Krugersdorp.    We made an excursion to the so-called battle-field before leaving for the  South. We started in a covered waggonette with no springs to speak of,  drawn by six mules, and a pair of horses as leaders. Two Kaffirs acted  as charioteers, and kept up an incessant jabber in Dutch. The one who  held the reins looked good-natured enough, but the other, whose duty it  was to wield the enormously long whip, had a most diabolical cast of  countenance, in which cruelty and doggedness were both clearly depicted.  We found his face a true indication of his character before the end of  the day. Bumping gaily along, we soon left the well-built houses behind,  and after passing the Malay quarter of the town, remarkable by reason of  the quaint houses these blacks make out of paraffin tins, flattened out  and nailed together with wonderful neatness, we emerged on the open  veldt. Of course the road was of the roughest description, and sometimes  we had to hold on with all our might to avoid the concussion of our  heads with the wooden roof. In spite of this, as soon as the Kaffirs  saw an open space before them, the huge whip was cracked, and away went  our team at full gallop, seemingly quite out of control, the driver  leaning back in his seat with a contented grin, while his colleague  manipulated the unwieldy whip. The tract ran parallel to the Rand for  some distance, and we got a splendid view of Johannesburg and the row of  chimney-shafts that so clearly define the reef.    On passing Langlaate village, we were stopped by a party of Boers, who  had off-saddled by the side of the road. As they were fully armed and  their appearance was not prepossessing, we expected to be ordered to  alight while our conveyance was being searched. However, our fears were  unfounded, and they were most polite. The driver muttered something in  Dutch, whereupon the leader came to the door, and said in broken  English: \"Peeck neeck--I see all right.\" I am sorry to say one of the  gentlemen of our party muttered \"Brute\" in an audible whisper; but,  then, he had undergone a short, but a very unpleasant term of  imprisonment, with no sort of excuse, at the instance of a Boer  _Veldtcornet_, so no wonder he had vowed eternal vengeance. Luckily,  this officer did not hear, or else did not understand, the ejaculation,  so after a civil interchange of good-days we drove on.    After about three hours we reached a shallow ford over a wide stream,  and our driver informed us that this was our destination. Leaving the  carriage, we walked up to some rocks overlooking the stream, which  seemed an inviting place for luncheon; but we were quickly driven away,  as thereon were lying seven or eight carcasses of dead horses and mules.  Curiously enough, the vultures, or \"aas-vogels,\" had left the skins on  these poor beasts, for I remember noticing how their coats glistened in  the sunshine. This sight was not very conducive to a good appetite, and  a little farther on we saw another pathetic spectacle: a very deep  trench, made in the past by some gold-prospector, had been filled in  with rocky boulders, and was covered with withered ferns. Here lay those  who had fallen of the Chartered Company's Forces. No doubt by now the  space is enclosed as a tiny part of God's acre, but at that time the  rough stones in the deep grave, and the faded flowers, seemed to enhance  the dreariness of the scene.[10] As to the locality of the final  encounter and surrender of the Raiders, there was not much to interest  any but military men. Standing on the top of the eminence before alluded  to, one could see the Boer position and the sore strait of their foes.  Whether the column had come purposely towards this drift, as being the  only possible ford for many miles, or whether they had been guided  thereto by "]]]
