You were not gentle; but you aren't that as a rule,  though your game is fair enough.\"    \"Not for Bourne. He doesn't like my game. I'm too rough. It's bad form,  _pace_ Bourne, therefore I'm barred my place in the eleven.\"    \"Is that the explanation?\"    \"Yes. Honour bright! Except\"--Acton paused diplomatically for a  moment--\"except, I don't think he likes me.\"    \"Then Phil is a fool, and he'll find out pretty speedily that we can't  stand rot of this quality. I, of course, can't take the cap.\"    \"My dear fellow, why in the world not? If you don't, some other house will  get it. Biffen's deserves two fellows in the eleven this year.\"    \"They do, by Jove!\"    \"Then let us have the satisfaction of keeping out another Corker fellow.\"    Dick told the other fellows plainly and without any gilding, his  conversation with Acton, and they pressed him to go and see Phil  personally; so Dick marched heavily to Bourne's quarters.    \"Sorry, Worcester, but I cannot explain anything. Not even to you. But I  do hope you'll come into the eleven.\"    Dick said shortly, \"I think I shall, for Biffen's deserves the other cap,  though the right fellow isn't getting it. By the way, Bourne, you'll not  be very sweet to the school generally after this. They--the fellows--to a  man, are no end cut up over Acton's treatment.\"    \"I supposed they would be. I knew it would be so.\"    \"Look here, Phil. You always did the square thing. Let us have the reason  for this,\" said Dick, earnestly.    \"Sorry, Worcester, I can't.\"    \"Good night, then.\"    \"Good night.\"    The rage and consternation of the Biffenites when they found that Bourne  was immovable in his decision can be imagined. Some were inclined to take  the matter up to Corker's throne, but they were a miserable minority.    \"Let Corker have a finger in our own private affairs!\" said Dick, with  intense disgust. \"What next, gentlemen? We won't be able to blow our own  noses without his permission. Keep the masters out of this, whatever we  do. Can't we see the thing through ourselves? I vote we try, anyhow.\"    Some were inclined to blame Dick for accepting the cap; but pretty  generally it was agreed that, if Acton was not to have it, Dick was the  next best man, but at what a distance! The honour of having two men in the  eleven was no _solatium_ for the wounded pride of Biffen's, when they  considered their great injury. The reason, though, was, naturally, what  puzzled them--and, for the matter of that, the whole school. Did Bourne  expect his team to play footer as though it were a game of croquet? Were  drawing-room manners to be introduced on to the Acres' clay? Were the  famous eleven of St. Amory's to amble about, like a swarm of  bread-and-butter misses? One wit suggested wadded coats and respirators.  Acton rough, indeed! Phil Bourne must be an embodiment of his grandmother,  then! Most of the fags in Biffen's house sent Phil elaborate instructions  for \"a nice drawing-room game to take the place of 'Socker'  football--nasty, rough 'Socker' footer--for one-and-six, and guaranteed  to do no injury to the most delicate constitution. A child can play it!\"  These letters were anonymous, of course; but Biffen's house-paper was  freely used. \"Anyhow,\" said Phil, with a gentle smile to me, \"the spelling  is obviously Biffen's.\"    Acton went on his own way, serenely indifferent to his house, which would  have made a god of him on the smallest provocation. He cheerfully ignored  Bourne, and he had the art of never seeing Phil when they met, in school  or out, though, of course, Phil minded this not at all. When the  Carthusians were played, Acton spent the afternoon reading with Raven,  whose exam, was now very near; and, whilst the two were grinding out all  the absurd details of Horace and his patron, \"and the poet's little farm,  and the other rot which gains Perry Exhibitions,\" the shouts and cheers  of the school down at the Acres came floating up the hill to their room.    The school lost their match with the Carthusians--the match which a good  St. Amorian would rather win than any two others--and it was plain that  Dick, though a useful fellow, could not bottle up the forwards in the  Actonian style. This defeat was the last straw to break the back of the  school's patience.    It was customary, after the Carthusian match, for the footer captain to  give his eleven a formal tea, Phil arranged the usual preliminaries, sick  at heart, and wearily certain as to the result. Three put in an  appearance--Vercoe, Baines, and Roberts--and in place of the burly forms  of the rest of the St. Amory's eleven, the sylph-like figures of their  fags flitted to Phil's hall of entertainment with curt little notes.  Worcester and the rest \"regretted they were unable to avail themselves of  the captain's invitation.\"    The tea was not a success.    The school followed the plain lead of the eleven, and as Phil hurried  along to chapel the next day no one hooked in with him, as had been done  \"the day before yesterday!\" He was left severely alone.    In plain words, St Amory's School consigned Phil Bourne to Coventry.          CHAPTER VII    THANKS TO ACTON      After the Carthusian match there was but one topic, or to be strictly  accurate, perhaps, two topics of interest in the school--who would be  cock-house at footer and who would get the Perry Exhibition.    The rest of the houses knew that Biffen's house was not now the  unconsidered article it was once; that it wasn't the door-mat upon which  any one might wipe his feet before proceeding into the inner circles of  the housers' competition, and there was more than a little curiosity to  see how far the \"resurrected\" house would mount.    But not a single soul dreamt that it would reach the final. The whole  school gasped for a fortnight on end as Biffen's annihilated Dover's,  Hargen's, Sharpe's, and Merishall's _seriatim_, and at last faced  Corker's house in the final. This was a resurrected house with a  vengeance! Corker's had had a bye in the first round and had been drawn  against rather rickety houses since, but they were generally fancied to  pull off the final as usual, for Bourne was captain, and they had Hodgson  and Roberts of the eleven as well. The wonderful progress of Biffen's had  thrown an awful lot of excitement into the game.    The match was fixed for the last Saturday in the term, and the result of  the Perry Exhibition was to be announced on the evening of the same day,  so the last Saturday was going to be the memorable day of the Michaelmas  stretch.    If you want a full account of the match you had better write to the editor  of _The Amorian_. He will send you the magazine with a page or so of  description and account, but all I'm going to say is that Bourne and Acton  played as they had never played before--I think I've said that before  about Acton, but he really was superlative in the housers' final--and that  five minutes from time the score was \"one all.\" Then Acton showed the  school a stroke of genius. He brought Raven out from centre-forward, where  he was quite unable to cope with Bourne, whispered him to go \"back\" with  Worcester, and before any one could realize what was happening he was  playing forward himself. He' was a \"lambent flame along the ground\" if you  like. In a second Biffen's were swarming round Roberts in goal, Acton  passed out to Chalmers, who was ready for the pass, and in a twinkling the  ball was in the net. From the row you might have imagined the school had  gone mad.    [Illustration: ACTON JUST REACHED IT WITH HIS HEAD.]    The ball was kicked off again. Almost immediately Acton secured near the  centre. He dribbled through the ruck of his opponents until he saw Bourne  upon him. With a smile of triumph upon his lips he gently rolled the  leather to Chalmers, who was hungrily waiting for the pass out on the  touch-line. Chalmers waltzed beautifully for the short run almost to the  corner flag. He steadied himself for one instant after his run, and then  lifted the ball magnificently into the goal mouth. As the leather was  skimming past, Acton just reached it with his head and deflected it high  and dry out of Roberts' reach into the net. It was the supreme effort  of his splendid game.    Biffen's had won by three goals to one!    They carried Acton off the field in ecstasy, and nearly scared Dame Biffen  out of her wits by the \"whisper\" of \"cock-house.\" Well, it certainly was  unusual.    After tea the whole of St. Amory's crowded into the Speech Room to hear  the result of the Perry Exhibition. There would not be a fellow away, I  should fancy, bar the cripples in the hospital, for there was no end of  excitement. Was this to be another Biffen's triumph? Was Raven of the  Fifth to beat Hodgson, the chosen of the Sixth, for the Perry? It was not  to be expected that he would, but when the whisper circled round that  Acton had '\"coached\" him in classics it was agreed that perhaps there  would be another feather in Acton's cap.    The masters were there on the platform in serried ranks, the whole fifty  of them, from Corker to Pfenning who \"does\" the music.    Corker, as usual, went straight to the mark, whilst the entire mass of  fellows kept a death-like silence. \"The result of the examination for the  Perry Exhibition is as follows:--        1st. Arthur Raven, 672 marks.      2nd. Theodore Hodgson, 591 marks.      3rd. Augustus Vernon Robert Todd, 114 marks.\"    Then out broke the usual uproar, \"shivering the silence,\" as some one  says, \"into clamour.\" We all cheered for Raven, who scored a popular and  unexpected victory, for why should a Fifth Form fellow beat one of the  Sixth? Biffen's crowd kept up the cheering until Corker rose again.    \"I can heartily congratulate Raven on his success, for his classical  knowledge was distinctly good."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#7)"],[1," little to the left until he starts,  and then let him walk off slowly with the reins loose. Walk him around in  the stable a few times until he gets used to the bit, and you can turn him  about in every direction and stop him as you please. It would be well to  get on and off a good many times until he gets perfectly used to it before  you take him out of the stable.    After you have trained him in this way, which should not take you more  than one or two hours, you can ride him any where you choose without ever  having him jump or make any effort to throw you.    When you first take him out of the stable be very gentle with him, as he  will feel a little more at liberty to jump or run, and be a little easier  frightened than he was while in the stable. But after handling him so much  in the stable he will be pretty well broke, and you will be able to manage  him without trouble or danger.    When you first mount him take a little the shortest hold on the left rein,  so that if any thing frightens him you can prevent him jumping by pulling  his head around to you. This operation of pulling a horse's head around  against his side will prevent any horse from jumping ahead, rearing up, or  running away. If he is stubborn and will not go you can make him move by  pulling his head around to one side, when whipping would have no effect.  And turning him around a few times will make him dizzy, and then by  letting him have his head straight, and giving him a little touch with the  whip, he will go along without any trouble.    Never use martingales on a colt when you first ride him; every movement of  the hand should go right to the bit in the direction in which it is  applied to the reins, without a martingale to change the direct of the  force applied. You can guide the colt much better without them, and learn  him the use of the bit in much less time. Besides, martingales would  prevent you from pulling his head around if he should try to jump.    After your colt has been rode until he is gentle and well accustomed to  the bit, you may find it an advantage if he carries his head too high, or  his nose too far out, to put martingales on him.    You should be careful not to ride your colt so far at first as to heat,  worry or tire him. Get off as soon as you see he is a little fatigued;  gentle him and let him rest, this will make him kind to you and prevent  him from getting stubborn or mad.      THE PROPER WAY TO BIT A COLT.    Farmers often put bitting harness on a colt the first thing they do to  him, buckling up the bitting as tight as they can draw it to make him  carry his head high, and then turn him out in a lot to run a half day at a  time. This is one of the worst punishments that they could inflict on the  colt, and very injurious to a young horse that has been used to running in  pasture with his head down. I have seen colts so injured in this way that  they never got over it.    A horse should be well accustomed to the bit before you put on the bitting  harness, and when you first bit him you should only rein his head up to  that point where he naturally holds it, let that be high or low; he will  soon learn that he cannot lower his head, and that raising it a little  will loosen the bit in his mouth. This will give him the idea of raising  his head to loosen the bit, and then you can draw the bitting a little  tighter every time you put it on, and he will still raise his head to  loosen it; by this means you will gradually get his head and neck in the  position you want him to carry it, and give him a nice and graceful  carriage without hurting him, making him mad, or causing his mouth to get  sore.    If you put the bitting on very tight the first time, he cannot raise his  head enough to loosen it, but will bear on it all the time, and paw, sweat  and throw himself. Many horses have been killed by falling backward with  the bitting on, their heads being drawn up, strike the ground with the  whole weight of the body. Horses that have their heads drawn up tightly  should not have the bitting on more than fifteen or twenty minutes at a  time.      HOW TO DRIVE A HORSE THAT IS VERY WILD, AND HAS ANY VICIOUS HABIT    Take up one fore foot and bend his knee till his hoof is bottom upwards,  and merely touching his body, then slip a loop over his knee, and up until  it comes above the pasture joint to keep it up, being careful to draw the  loop together between the hoof and pasture joint with a second strap of  some kind, to prevent the loop from slipping down and coming off. This  will leave the horse standing on three legs; you can now handle him as you  wish, for it is utterly impossible for him to kick in this position.  There is something in this operation of taking up one foot that conquers a  horse quicker and better than any thing else you can do to him. There is  no process in the world equal to it to break a kicking horse, for several  reasons. First, there is a principle of this kind in the nature of the  horse; that by conquering one member you conquer to a great extent the  whole horse.    You have perhaps seen men operate upon this principle by sewing a horse's  ears together to prevent him from kicking. I once saw a plan given in a  newspaper to make a bad horse stand to be shod, which was to fasten down  one ear. There were no reasons given why you should do so; but I tried it  several times, and thought it had a good effect--though I would not  recommend its use, especially stitching his ears together. The only  benefit arising from this process is, that by disarranging his ears we  draw his attention to them, and he is not so apt to resist the shoeing. By  tying up one foot we operate on the same principle to a much better  effect. When you first fasten up a horse's foot he will sometimes get very  mad, and strike with his knee, and try every possible way to get it down;  but he cannot do that, and will soon give it up.    This will conquer him better than anything you could do, and without any  possible danger of hurting himself or you either, for you can tie up his  foot and sit down and look at him until he gives up. When you find that he  is conquered, go to him, let down his foot, rub his leg with your hand,  caress him and let him rest a little, then put it up again. Repeat this a  few times, always putting up the same foot, and he will soon learn to  travel on three legs so that you can drive him some distance. As soon as  he gets a little used to this way of traveling, put on your harness and  hitch him to a sulky. If he is the worst kicking horse that ever raised a  foot you need not be fearful of his doing any damage while he has one foot  up, for he cannot kick, neither can he run fast enough to do any harm. And  if he is the wildest horse that ever had harness on, and has run away  every time he has been hitched, you can now hitch him in a sulky and drive  him as you please. And if he wants to run you can let him have the lines,  and the whip too, with perfect safety, for he cannot go but a slow gait on  three legs, and will soon be tired and willing to stop; only hold him  enough to guide him in the right direction, and he will soon be tired and  willing to stop at the word. Thus you will effectually cure him at once of  any further notion of running off. Kicking horses have always been the  dread of every body; you always hear men say, when they speak about a bad  horse, \"I don't care what he does, so he don't kick.\" This new method is  an effectual cure for this worst of all habits. There are plenty of ways  by which you can hitch a kicking horse and force him to go, though he  kicks all the time; but this don't have any good effect towards breaking  him, for we know that horses kick because they are afraid of what is  behind them, and when they kick against it and it hurts them they will  only kick the harder, and this will hurt them still more and make them  remember the scrape much longer, and make it still more difficult to  persuade them to have any confidence in any thing dragging behind them  ever after.    But by this new method you can hitch them to a rattling sulky, plow,  wagon, or anything else in its worst shape. They may be frightened at  first, but cannot kick or do any thing to hurt themselves, and will soon  find that you do not intend to hurt them, and then they will not care any  thing more about it. You can then let down the leg and drive along gently  without any farther trouble. By this new process a bad kicking horse can  be learned to go gentle in harness in a few hours' time.      ON BALKING.    Horses know nothing about balking, only as they are brought into it by  improper management, and when a horse balks in harness it is generally  from some mismanagement, excitement, confusion, or from not knowing how to  pull, but seldom from any unwillingness to perform all that he  understands. High spirited, free going horses are the most subject to  balking, and only so because drivers do not properly understand how to  manage this kind. A free horse in a team may be so anxious to go that when  he hears the word he will start with a jump, which will not move the load,  but give him such a severe jerk on the shoulders that he will fly back and  stop the other horse; the teamster will continue his driving without any  cessation, and by the time he has the slow horse started again he will  find that the free horse has made another jump, and again flew back, and  now he has them both badly balked, and so confused that neither of them  knows what is the matter, or how to start the load. Next will come the  slashing and cracking of the whip, and hallooing of the driver, till  something is broken or he is through with his course of treatment. But  what a mistake the driver commits by whipping his horse for this act.  Reason and common sense should teach him that the horse was willing and  anxious to go, but did not know how to start the load. And should he"]]]
