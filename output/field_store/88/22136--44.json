In the beginning, we cannot  choose wisely the best examples to set before ourselves; therefore it  is for us to heed what another wise man said: \"As to choice in the  study of pieces, ask the advice of more experienced persons than  yourself; by so doing you will save much time.\" [36] You thereby save  time doubly. Later on in your life you will have no bad taste to  overcome--that is one saving; and already you know from childhood many  classics, and that is another saving. What we learn in childhood is a  power all our lives.    You can see plainly, now, that both in the choice of pieces and in the  manner of playing them, a person's character will come out. We saw in  the last Talk how character has to come out in writing. Only a very  common character would select pieces written entirely for a vain  show--of rapid runs, glittering arpeggios, and loud, unmeaning chords.  Worse than that, such a choice of pieces displays two common  people,--three, in fact: A composer who did not write pure thought  from the heart; a teacher who did not instil good thoughts into the  pupil's heart; and yourself (if really you care for such things) who  play from a vain desire to be considered brilliant.    A player who devotes the mind and the hands only to what a meaningless  composer writes for them is not worthy of any power. With our hands in  music, as with the tongue in speech, let us strive from the beginning  to be truthful. Let us try in both ways to express the highest truth  we are able to conceive. Then in art we shall, at least, approach near  unto the true artist; and in life we shall approach near unto the true  life. Every mere empty display-piece we study takes up the time and  the opportunity wherein we could learn a good composition, by a master  of the heart. And it is only with such music that you will, during  your life, get into the hearts of those who are most worthy for you to  know. Out of just this thought Schumann has two rules now very easy  for us to understand:    \"Never help to circulate bad compositions; on the contrary, help to  suppress them with earnestness.\"    \"You should neither play bad compositions, nor, unless compelled,  listen to them.\"    We now come to a really definite conclusion about the compositions we  should play and to an extent as to how we should play them.    The heart, the mind, and the hands, or the voice, if you sing, should  unite in our music; and be consecrated to the beautiful. Consecrate is  just exactly the word. Look for it in your dictionary.[37] It comes  from two other words, does it not? _Con_ meaning _with_ and _sacer_  meaning _holiness._ Thus devote heart and head and hands _with  holiness_ to the beautiful. This is very clear, I am sure.    It is also worth doing. \"With holiness\" describes _how_ to play and  really _what_ to play. A composition which has been born of a true man  is in thought already consecrated. He has heard it and felt it within  himself. Daily you must get closer and closer to these messages and  meanings. And are they not already more _luminous_ to you? And do you  remember what we said luminous means?          CHAPTER X.    THE LESSON.        \"All people value most what has cost them much labor.\"    --Aristotle.[38]    It is true that music is beautiful and that it gives us happiness and  comfort. But, nevertheless, music is hard to learn _for every one_;  harder for some than for others, but hard for all. It is well and best  that it should be so. We appreciate most highly that which we labor  for earnestly. Just imagine if every one could sing or play merely by  wishing it! Then music would be so common and so much the talent of  all that it would cease to give us joy. Why? Because one gained it by  a wish. That is not enough. From this can we learn to understand the  great secret of it all? I think we can. Let us see! The secret is  this: Music is a joy because it takes us out of ourselves and we work  hard to get it. Music teaches us what a wonderful power there is  within us, if we will only strive to bring it out. Education is good  for us for this same reason. As you learn more and more about words,  you will see more in this word Education.    It means to lead out _what is within us_. To lead music out of the  heart becomes the object, then, of your lessons. One cannot drive  music into you; it must be led out.    Where shall we look for music that it may be led out? Only in the  heart. That is where all is in every one of us. But often in our  hearts there is so much else, so much vanity, self-love, conceit, love  for other things, that the music is almost beyond reach. _Almost_, but  never entirely. In the heart of every one is music. But often it is  deep, deep down, covered by these other things. The older we grow and  the more other things we see and think about, the deeper and deeper  down does the music get.    It is like heaping rocks, and dirt, and sticks on a bubbling spring.  The spring is down there, bubbling freely beneath it all, still  striving to be as free and as songful as before; but it cannot. People  may come and go, may pass near to it, and hear not one of its sounds;  they may never suspect that there is such a thing ready to go on  merrily if it could.    When is the best time to lead water out of the spring, and music out  of the heart? Before other things begin to cover it. With music the  best time is in the early days, in childhood time--_in the first  days_. We shall hear those words many times. Then little by little the  bubbling spring of melody gains its independence; then, even if other  things do come in, they cannot bury the music out of sight. The spring  has been led forth _and has grown stronger_.    Thoughtful people who have suffered in learning--all people suffer in  learning, thoughtful ones the most--wonder how they can make the task  less painful for others. It will always cause us sorrow as well as joy  to learn, and many people spend their lives in trying to have as  little sorrow as possible come with the learning of the young. When  such people are true and good and thoughtful and _have infinite  kindness_, they are teachers; and the teachers impose tasks upon us  severely, perhaps, but with kind severity. They study us and music,  and they seek out the work each one of us must perform in order that  we may keep the heart-springs pure and uncovered. Further than this,  they find the way by which we shall lead the waters of life which flow  out of the heart-springs. They find the way whither they should flow  best.    Often in the doing of these things we find the lessons hard and  wearisome, infinitely hard to bear, difficult, and not attractive. We  wonder why all these things should be so, and we learn in the moment  we ask that question that these painful tasks are the price we are  paying for the development of our talent. That is truly the purpose of  a lesson. And the dear teacher, wise because she has been painfully  over the road herself, knows how good and necessary it is for us to  labor as she directs.    Let us suppose you play the piano. There will be two kinds of  lessons--one will be for the fingers, one for the mind. But really the  mind also guides the finger-work; and the heart must be in all. Your  exercises will give you greater power to speak with the fingers. Every  new finger-exercise in piano-playing is like a new word in language.  Provided with it, you can say more than you could before. The work for  the mind is the classics. These are compositions by the greater and  lesser masters with which you form the taste, while the technical  exercises are provided to give you the power, the ability, to play  them. Thus you see how well these two things go together.    Year after year, if you go on patiently, you will add to each of these  tasks; more power will come to the fingers and to the mind. All this  time you will be coming nearer and nearer to the true music. More and  more will be coming out of your heart. The spring will not only  continue to bubble clearly but it will become more powerful. Nothing  is so wonderful as that.    Do you know what a sad thing it was for the man not to increase that  one talent which had been given to him? [39] Perchance you have also  one. Then find it, love it, increase it. Know that every step of the  way, every bit of task, every moment of faith is paid for in later  years ten thousandfold.    If now we remember our Talk on Listening it will serve us. Did we not  say then that the first duty of a listener is to the one who speaks  for his good? Lesson time is an opportunity above nearly all others  when we should listen with love in our attention. Yes, nothing less  than that, because--how many times we have heard it already--putting  love into anything, is putting the heart into it, and with less than  that we do not get all we may have.    This Talk, then, is important, because it gathers together many things  that have gone before, and hints at some to come. Let us give the last  words to speaking about that. A lesson suggests listening; listening  suggests the teacher, who with infinite kindness and severity guides  us; and the teacher suggests the beautiful road along which we go and  what we hear as we travel, that is the music of the heart; and the  music of the heart has in it the tones about us, and the greater and  lesser masters who thought them into beautiful forms. The masters are  as servants unto whom there is given to some one talent, to others  two, and four, and more, but to each according to his worth, to be  guided and employed in truth and honor; increased by each in  accordance to his strength.          CHAPTER XI.    THE LIGHT ON THE PATH.        \"Let us seek service and be helpers of one another.\"    \"Master,\" said the little child, \"I am unhappy. Though I have  companions and games, they do not content me.

Thus end the games, and the procession forms,    The king and elders first, contestants next,    And last the prince; each victor laurel-crowned,    And after each his prize, while all were given    Some choice memorial of the happy day--    Cinctures to all athletes to gird the loins    And falling just below the knee, the belt    Of stoutest leather, joined with silver clasps,    The skirt of softest wool or finest silk,    Adorned with needlework and decked with gems,    Such as the modest Aryans always wore    In games intended for the public view,    Before the Greeks became degenerate,    And savage Rome compelled those noble men    Whose only crime was love of liberty,    By discipline and numbers overwhelmed,    Bravely defending children, wife and home,    Naked to fight each other or wild beasts,    And called this brutal savagery high sport    For them and for their proud degenerate dames,    Of whom few were what Caesar's wife should be.    The athletes' prizes all were rich and rare,    Some costly emblem of their several arts.    The archers' prizes all were bows; the first    Made from the horns of a great mountain-goat    That long had ranged the Himalayan heights,    Till some bold hunter climbed his giddy cliffs    And brought his unsuspecting victim down.    His lofty horns the bowsmith root to root    Had firmly joined, and polished, bright,    And tipped with finest gold, and made a bow    Worthy of Sinhahamu's[1] mighty arm.    The other prizes, bows of lesser strength    But better suited to their weaker arms.    A chariot, the charioteers' first prize,[2]    Its slender hubs made strong with brazen bands,    The spokes of whitest ivory polished bright,    The fellies ebony, with tires of bronze,    Each axle's end a brazen tiger's head,    The body woven of slender bamboo shoots    Intwined with silver wire and decked with gold.    A mare and colt of the victorious breed    The second prize, more worth in Timour's eyes.    Than forty chariots, though each were made    Of ebony or ivory or gold,    And all the laurel India ever grew.    The third, a tunic of soft Cashmere wool,    On which, by skillful needles deftly wrought,    The race itself as if in life stood forth.    The fourth, a belt to gird the laggard's loins    And whip to stimulate his laggard steeds.      And thus arrayed they moved once round the course,    Then to the palace, as a fitter place    For beauty's contest than the open plain;    The singers chanting a triumphal hymn,    While many instruments, deep toned and shrill,    And all the multitude, the chorus swell.      This day his mission ceased to press the prince,    And he forgot the sorrows of the world,    So deep and earnest seemed the general joy.    Even those with grinning skeletons at home    In secret closets locked from public view,    And care and sorrow rankling at their hearts,    Joined in the general laugh and swelled the shouts,    And seemed full happy though they only seemed.    But through the games, while all was noisy mirth,    He felt a new, strange feeling at his heart,    And ever and anon he stole a glance    At beauty's rose-embowered hiding-place,    To catch a glimpse of those two laughing eyes,    So penetrating yet so soft and mild.    And at the royal banquet spread for all    It chanced Yasodhara sat next the prince--    An accident by older heads designed--    And the few words that such constraint allowed    Were music to his ears and touched his heart;    And when her eyes met his her rosy blush    Told what her maiden modesty would hide.    And at the dance, when her soft hands touched his    The music seemed to quicken, time to speed;    But when she bowed and passed to other hands,    Winding the mystic measure of the dance,[3]    The music seemed to slacken, time to halt,    Or drag his limping moments lingering on.    At length, after the dance, the beauties passed    Before the prince, and each received her prize.    So rich and rare that each thought hers the first,    A treasure to be kept and shown with pride,    And handed down to children yet unborn.    But when Yasodhara before him stood,    The prizes all were gone; but from his neck    He took a golden chain thick set with gems,    And clasped it round her slender waist, and said:    \"Take this, and keep it for the giver's sake.\"      And from the prince they passed before the king.    The proud and stately he would greet with grace,    The timid cheer with kind and gracious words.    But when Yasodhara bowed low and passed,    He started, and his color went and came    As if oppressed with sudden inward pain.    Asita, oldest of his counselors,    Sprang to his side and asked: \"What ails the king?\"    \"Nothing, my friend, nothing,\" the king replied,    \"But the sharp probing of an ancient wound.    You know how my sweet queen was loved of all--    But how her life was woven into mine,    Filling my inmost soul, none e'er can know.    My bitter anguish words can never tell,    As that sweet life was gently breathed away.    Time only strengthens this enduring love,    And she seems nearer me as I grow old.    Often in stillest night's most silent hour,    When the sly nibbling of a timid mouse    In the deep stillness sounds almost as loud    As builders' hammers in the busy day,    My Maya as in life stands by my side.    A halo round her head, as she would say:    'A little while, and you shall have your own.'    Often in deepest sleep she seems to steal    Into that inmost chamber of my soul    Vacant for her, and nestle to my heart,    Breathing a peace my waking hours know not.    And when I wake, and turn to clasp my love    My sinking heart finds but her vacant place.    Since that sad day that stole her from my arms    I've seen a generation of sweet girls    Grow up to womanhood, but none like her!    Hut that bright vision that just flitted by    Seemed so like her it made me cringe and start.    O dear Asita, little worth is life,    With all its tears and partings, woes and pains,    If when its short and fitful fever ends    There is no after-life, where death and pain,    And sundered ties, and crushed and bleeding hearts,    And sad and last farewells are never known.\"      Such was the old and such the new-born love;    The new quick bursting into sudden flame,    Warming the soul to active consciousness    That man alone is but a severed part    Of one full, rounded, perfect, living whole;    The old a steady but undying flame,    A living longing for the loved and lost;    But each a real hunger of the soul    For what gave paradise its highest bliss,    And what in this poor fallen world of ours    Gives glimpses of its high and happy life.      O love! how beautiful! how pure! how sweet!    Life of the angels that surround God's throne!    But when corrupt, Pandora's box itself,    Whence spring all human ills and woes and crimes,    The very fire that lights the flames of hell.      The festival is past.  The crowds have gone,    The diligent to their accustomed round    Of works and days, works to each day assigned,    The thoughtless and the thriftless multitude    To meet their tasks haphazard as they come,    But all the same old story to repeat    Of cares and sorrows sweetened by some joys.      Three days the sweet Yasodhara remained,    For her long journey taking needful rest.    But when the rosy dawn next tinged the east    And lit the mountain-tops and filled the park    With a great burst of rich and varied song,    The good old king bade the sweet girl farewell,    Imprinting on her brow a loving kiss,    While welling up from tender memories    Big tear-drops trickled down his furrowed cheeks.    And as her train, escorted by the prince    And noble youth, wound slowly down the hill,    The rising sun with glory gilds the city    That like a diadem circled its brow,    While giant shadows stretch across the plain;    And when they reach the plain they halt for rest    Deep in a garden's cooling shade, where flowers    That fill the air with grateful fragrance hang    By ripening fruits, and where all seems at rest    Save two young hearts and tiny tireless birds    That dart from flower to newer to suck their sweets,    And even the brook that babbled down the hill    Now murmurs dreamily as if asleep.    Sweet spot! sweet hour! how quick its moments fly!    How soon the cooling winds and sinking sun    And bustling stir of preparation tells    'Tis time for her to go; and when they part,    The gentle pressure of the hand, one kiss--    A kiss not given yet not resisted--tells    A tale of love that words are poor to tell.    And when she goes how lonely seems her way    Through groves, through fields, through busy haunts of men;    And as he climbs the hill and often stops    To watch her lessening train until at length    Her elephant seems but a moving speck,    Proud Kantaka, pawing and neighing, asks    As plain as men could ever ask in, words:    \"What makes my master choose this laggard pace?\"      At length she climbs those rocky, rugged hills.    That guarded well the loveliest spot on earth    Until the Moguls centuries after came,    Like swarms of locusts swept before the wind,    Or ravening wolves, to conquer fair Cashmere.[4]    And when she reached the top, before her lay,    As on a map spread out, her native land,    By lofty mountains walled on every side,    From winds, from wars, and from the world shut out;    The same great snow-capped mountains north and east    In silent, glittering, awful grandeur stand,    And west the same bold, rugged, cliff-crowned hills.    That filled her eyes with wonder when a child.    Below the snow a belt of deepest green;    Below this belt of green great rolling"]]]
