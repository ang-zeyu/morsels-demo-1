Both  results will be as remote as possible from future reality, for the  reason that they are so near to present reality. And yet some germs of  the future must be enfolded even in the present moment. The course  of wisdom is to seek them neither in the old romance nor in the new  rationalism, but in the subtle and ever-changing spirit of the times.    [Illustration: PLATE IX. ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH BY OTTO RIETH]    The most modern note yet sounded in business, in diplomacy, in social  life, is expressed by the phrase, \"Live openly!\" From every quarter,  in regard to every manner of human activity, has come the cry, \"Let  in the light!\" By a physical correspondence not the result of  coincidence, but of the operation of an occult law, we have, in a very  real sense, let in the light. In buildings of the latest type devoted  to large uses, there has been a general abandonment of that \"cellular  system\" of many partitions which produced the pepper-box exterior, in  favour of great rooms serving diverse functions lit by vast areas of  glass. Although an increase of efficiency has dictated and determined  these changes, this breaking down of barriers between human beings  and their common sharing of the light of day in fuller measure, is a  symbol of the growth of brotherhood, and the search, by the soul, for  spiritual light.    Now if this fellowship and this quest gain volume and intensity, its  physical symbols are bound to multiply and find ever more perfect  forms of manifestation. So both as a practical necessity and as a  symbol the most pregnant and profound, we are likely to witness in  architecture the development of the House of Light, particularly as  human ingenuity has made this increasingly practicable.    Glass is a product still undergoing development, as are also those  devices of metal for holding it in position and making the joints  weather tight. The accident and fire hazard has been largely overcome  by protecting the structural parts, by the use of wire glass, and  by other ingenious devices. The author has been informed on good  authority that shortly before the outbreak of the war a glass had been  invented abroad, and made commercially practicable, which shut out  the heat rays, but admitted the light. The use of this glass would  overcome the last difficulty--the equalization of temperatures--and  might easily result in buildings of an entirely novel type, the  approach to which is seen in the \"pier and grill\" style of exterior.  This is being adopted not only for commercial buildings, but for  others of widely different function, on account of its manifest  advantages. Cass Gilbert's admirable studio apartment at 200 West  Fifty-Seventh Street, New York, is a building of this type.    In this seeking for sunlight in our cities, we will come to live on  the roofs more and more--in summer in the free air, in winter under  variformed shelters of glass. This tendency is already manifesting  itself in those newest hotels whose roofs are gardens, convertible  into skating ponds, with glazed belvideres for eating in all weathers.  Nothing but ignorance and inanition stand in the way of utilization of  waste roof spaces. People have lived on the roofs in the past, often  enough, and will again.    [Illustration: PLATE X. RODIN STUDIOS, 200 WEST 57TH STREET, NEW YORK]    By shouldering ever upward for air and light, we have too often  made of the \"downtown\" districts cliff-bound canyons--\"granite deeps  opening into granite deeps.\" This has been the result of no inherent  necessity, but of that competitive greed whose nemesis is ever to  miss the very thing it seeks. By intelligent co-operation, backed  by legislation, the roads and sidewalks might be made to share the  sunlight with the roofs.    This could be achieved in two ways: by stepping back the facades  in successive stages--giving top lighting, terraces, and wonderful  incidental effects of light and shade--or by adjusting the height of  the buildings to the width of their interspaces, making rows of tall  buildings alternate with rows of low ones, with occasional fully  isolated \"skyscrapers\" giving variety to the sky-line.    These and similar problems of city planning have been worked out  theoretically with much minuteness of detail, and are known to every  student of the science of cities, but very little of it all has been  realized in a practical way--certainly not on this side of the water,  where individual rights are held so sacred that a property owner may  commit any kind of an architectural nuisance so long as he confines  it to his own front yard. The strength of IS, the weakness of _should  be_, conflicting interests and legislative cowardice are responsible  for the highly irrational manner in which our cities have grown great.    The search for spiritual light in the midst of materialism finds  unconscious symbolization in a way other than this seeking for the  sun. It is in the amazing development of artificial illumination. From  a purely utilitarian standpoint there is almost nothing that cannot  now be accomplished with light, short of making the ether itself  luminiferous. The aesthetic development of this field, however, can be  said to have scarcely begun. The so recent San Francisco Exposition  witnessed the first successful effort of any importance to enhance the  effect of architecture by artificial illumination, and to use colored  light with a view to its purely pictorial value. Though certain  buildings have since been illuminated with excellent effect, it  remains true that the corset, chewing-gum, beer and automobile  sky signs of our Great White Ways indicate the height to which our  imagination has risen in utilizing this Promethean gift in any but  necessary ways. Interior lighting, except negatively, has not been  dealt with from the standpoint of beauty, but of efficiency; the  engineer has preempted this field to the exclusion of the artist.    All this is the result of the atrophy of that faculty to worship and  wonder which alone induces the mood from which the creation of beauty  springs. Light we regard only as a convenience \"to see things by\"  instead of as the power and glory that it inherently is. Its intense  and potent vibrations and the rainbow glory of its colour beat at the  door of consciousness in vain. When we awaken to these things we shall  organize light into a language of spontaneous emotion, just as from  sound music was organized.    It is beside the purpose of this essay to attempt to trace the  evolution of this new art form, made possible by modern invention, to  indicate what phases it is likely to pass through on the way to what  perfections, but that it is bound to add a new glory to architecture  is sure. This will come about in two ways: directly, by giving color,  quality, subtlety to outdoor and indoor lighting, and indirectly by  educating the eye to color values, as the ear has been educated by  music; thus creating a need for more color everywhere.    As light is the visible symbol of an inner radiance, so is color the  sign manual of happiness, of joy. Our cities are so dun and drab in  their outward aspects, by reason of the weight of care that burdens  us down. We decry the happy irresponsibility of the savage, and the  patient contentment of the Oriental with his lot, but both are able  to achieve marvels of color in their environment beyond the compass  of civilized man. The glory of mediaeval cathedral windows is a still  living confutation of the belief that in those far-off times the human  heart was sad. Architecture is the index of the inner life of those  who produced it, and whenever it is colorful that inner life contains  an inner joy.    In the coming Golden Age life will be joyous, and if it is joyous,  colour will come into architecture again. Our psychological state even  now, alone prevents it, for we are rich in materials and methods to  make such polychromy possible. In an article in a recent number  of _The Architectural Record_, Mr. Leon V. Solon, writing from an  entirely different point of view, divines this tendency, and expresses  the opinion that color is again renascent. This tendency is so marked,  and this opinion is so shared that we may look with confidence toward  a color-evolution in architectural art.    The question of the character of what may be called the ornamental  mode of the architecture of the New Age is of all questions the most  obscure. Evolution along the lines of the already existent does not  help us here, for we are utterly without any ornamental mode from  which a new and better might conceivably evolve. Nothing so betrays  the spiritual bankruptcy of the end of the Iron Age as this.    The only light on this problem which we shall find, dwells in the  realm of metaphysics rather than in the world of material reality.  Ornament, more than any other element of architecture, is deeply  psychological, it is an externalization of an inner life. This is  so true that any time-worn fragment out of the past when art was  a language can usually be assigned to its place and its period, so  eloquent is it of a particular people and a particular time. Could we  therefore detect and understand the obscure movement of consciousness  in the modern world, we might gain some clue to the language it would  later find.    It is clear that consciousness is moving away from its absorption in  materiality because it is losing faith in materialism. Clairvoyance,  psychism, the recrudescence of mysticism, of occultism--these signs  of the times are straws which show which way the wind now sets, and  indicate that the modern mind is beginning to find itself at home in  what is called _the fourth dimension_. The phrase is used here in  a different sense from that in which the mathematician uses it, but  oddly enough four-dimensional geometry provides the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#7)"],[1,"appens, however, that one of the radical  elements becomes functionally so subordinated to the other that it takes  on the character of a grammatical element. We may symbolize this by  A + b, a type that may gradually, by loss of external connection between  the subordinated element b and its independent counterpart B merge with  the commoner type A + (b). A word like _beautiful_ is an example of  A + b, the _-ful_ barely preserving the impress of its lineage. A word  like _homely_, on the other hand, is clearly of the type A + (b), for no  one but a linguistic student is aware of the connection between the  _-ly_ and the independent word _like_.    In actual use, of course, these five (or six) fundamental types may be  indefinitely complicated in a number of ways. The (0) may have a  multiple value; in other words, the inherent formal modification of the  basic notion of the word may affect more than one category. In such a  Latin word as _cor_ \"heart,\" for instance, not only is a concrete  concept conveyed, but there cling to the form, which is actually shorter  than its own radical element (_cord-_), the three distinct, yet  intertwined, formal concepts of singularity, gender classification  (neuter), and case (subjective-objective). The complete grammatical  formula for _cor_ is, then, A + (0) + (0) + (0), though the merely  external, phonetic formula would be (A)--, (A) indicating the abstracted  \"stem\" _cord-_, the minus sign a loss of material. The significant thing  about such a word as _cor_ is that the three conceptual limitations are  not merely expressed by implication as the word sinks into place in a  sentence; they are tied up, for good and all, within the very vitals of  the word and cannot be eliminated by any possibility of usage.    Other complications result from a manifolding of parts. In a given word  there may be several elements of the order A (we have already symbolized  this by the type A + B), of the order (A), of the order b, and of the  order (b). Finally, the various types may be combined among themselves  in endless ways. A comparatively simple language like English, or even  Latin, illustrates but a modest proportion of these theoretical  possibilities. But if we take our examples freely from the vast  storehouse of language, from languages exotic as well as from those that  we are more familiar with, we shall find that there is hardly a  possibility that is not realized in actual usage. One example will do  for thousands, one complex type for hundreds of possible types. I select  it from Paiute, the language of the Indians of the arid plateaus of  southwestern Utah. The word  _wii-to-kuchum-punku-ruegani-yugwi-va-ntue-m(ue)_[5] is of unusual length  even for its own language, but it is no psychological monster for all  that. It means \"they who are going to sit and cut up with a knife a  black cow (_or_ bull),\" or, in the order of the Indian elements,  \"knife-black-buffalo-pet-cut up-sit(plur.)-future-participle-animate  plur.\" The formula for this word, in accordance with our symbolism,  would be (F) + (E) + C + d + A + B + (g) + (h) + (i) + (0). It is the  plural of the future participle of a compound verb \"to sit and cut  up\"--A + B. The elements (g)--which denotes futurity--, (h)--a  participial suffix--, and (i)--indicating the animate plural--are  grammatical elements which convey nothing when detached. The formula (0)  is intended to imply that the finished word conveys, in addition to what  is definitely expressed, a further relational idea, that of  subjectivity; in other words, the form can only be used as the subject  of a sentence, not in an objective or other syntactic relation. The  radical element A (\"to cut up\"), before entering into combination with  the cooerdinate element B (\"to sit\"), is itself compounded with two  nominal elements or element-groups--an instrumentally used stem (F)  (\"knife\"), which may be freely used as the radical element of noun  forms but cannot be employed as an absolute noun in its given form, and  an objectively used group--(E) + C + d (\"black cow _or_ bull\"). This  group in turn consists of an adjectival radical element (E) (\"black\"),  which cannot be independently employed (the absolute notion of \"black\"  can be rendered only as the participle of a verb: \"black-be-ing\"), and  the compound noun C + d (\"buffalo-pet\"). The radical element C properly  means \"buffalo,\" but the element d, properly an independently occurring  noun meaning \"horse\" (originally \"dog\" or \"domesticated animal\" in  general), is regularly used as a quasi-subordinate element indicating  that the animal denoted by the stem to which it is affixed is owned by a  human being. It will be observed that the whole complex  (F) + (E) + C + d + A + B is functionally no more than a verbal base,  corresponding to the _sing-_ of an English form like _singing_; that  this complex remains verbal in force on the addition of the temporal  element (g)--this (g), by the way, must not be understood as appended to  B alone, but to the whole basic complex as a unit--; and that the  elements (h) + (i) + (0) transform the verbal expression into a formally  well-defined noun.    [Footnote 5: In this and other examples taken from exotic languages I am  forced by practical considerations to simplify the actual phonetic  forms. This should not matter perceptibly, as we are concerned with form  as such, not with phonetic content.]    It is high time that we decided just what is meant by a word. Our first  impulse, no doubt, would have been to define the word as the symbolic,  linguistic counterpart of a single concept. We now know that such a  definition is impossible. In truth it is impossible to define the word  from a functional standpoint at all, for the word may be anything from  the expression of a single concept--concrete or abstract or purely  relational (as in _of_ or _by_ or _and_)--to the expression of a  complete thought (as in Latin _dico_ \"I say\" or, with greater  elaborateness of form, in a Nootka verb form denoting \"I have been  accustomed to eat twenty round objects [e.g., apples] while engaged in  [doing so and so]\"). In the latter case the word becomes identical with  the sentence. The word is merely a form, a definitely molded entity that  takes in as much or as little of the conceptual material of the whole  thought as the genius of the language cares to allow. Thus it is that  while the single radical elements and grammatical elements, the carriers  of isolated concepts, are comparable as we pass from language to  language, the finished words are not. Radical (or grammatical) element  and sentence--these are the primary _functional_ units of speech, the  former as an abstracted minimum, the latter as the esthetically  satisfying embodiment of a unified thought. The actual _formal_ units of  speech, the words, may on occasion identify themselves with either of  the two functional units; more often they mediate between the two  extremes, embodying one or more radical notions and also one or more  subsidiary ones. We may put the whole matter in a nutshell by saying  that the radical and grammatical elements of language, abstracted as  they are from the realities of speech, respond to the conceptual world  of science, abstracted as it is from the realities of experience, and  that the word, the existent unit of living speech, responds to the unit  of actually apprehended experience, of history, of art. The sentence is  the logical counterpart of the complete thought only if it be felt as  made up of the radical and grammatical elements that lurk in the  recesses of its words. It is the psychological counterpart of  experience, of art, when it is felt, as indeed it normally is, as the  finished play of word with word. As the necessity of defining thought  solely and exclusively for its own sake becomes more urgent, the word  becomes increasingly irrelevant as a means. We can therefore easily  understand why the mathematician and the symbolic logician are driven to  discard the word and to build up their thought with the help of symbols  which have, each of them, a rigidly unitary value.    But is not the word, one may object, as much of an abstraction as the  radical element? Is it not as arbitrarily lifted out of the living  sentence as is the minimum conceptual element out of the word? Some  students of language have, indeed, looked upon the word as such an  abstraction, though with very doubtful warrant, it seems to me. It is  true that in particular cases, especially in some of the highly  synthetic languages of aboriginal America, it is not always easy to say  whether a particular element of language is to be interpreted as an  independent word or as part of a larger word. These transitional cases,  puzzling as they may be on occasion, do not, however, materially weaken  the case for the psychological validity of the word. Linguistic  experience, both as expressed in standardized, written form and as  tested in daily usage, indicates overwhelmingly that there is not, as a  rule, the slightest difficulty in bringing the word to consciousness as  a psychological reality. No more convincing test could be desired than  this, that the naive Indian, quite unaccustomed to the concept of the  written word, has nevertheless no serious difficulty in dictating a text  to a linguistic student word by word; he tends, of course, to run his  words together as in actual speech, but if he is called to a halt and is  made to understand what is desired, he can readily isolate the words as  such, repeating them as units. He regularly refuses, on the other hand,  to isolate the radical or grammatical element, on the ground that it  \"makes no sense.\"[6] What, then, is the objective criterion of the word?  The speaker and hearer feel the word, let us grant, but how shall we  justify their feeling? If function is not the ultimate criterion of the  word, what is?    [Footnote 6: These oral"]]]
