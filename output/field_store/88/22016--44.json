We ought also to mention  in this connection, that wherever cream is recommended, unless otherwise  designated, the quality used in the preparation of the recipes is that  of single or twelve hour cream sufficiently diluted with milk, so that  one fourth of each quart of milk is reckoned as cream. If a richer  quality than this be used, the quantity should be diminished in  proportion; otherwise, by the excess of fat, a wholesome food may become  a rich, unhealthful dish.    In conclusion, the author desires to state that no recipe has been  admitted to this work which has not been thoroughly tested by repeated  trials, by far the larger share of such being original, either in the  combination of the materials used, the method employed, or both  materials and method. Care has been taken not to cumber the work with  useless and indifferent recipes. It is believed that every recipe will  be found valuable, and that the variety offered is sufficiently ample,  so that under the most differing circumstances, all may be well served.    We trust therefore that those who undertake to use the work as a guide  in their culinary practice, will not consider any given recipe a failure  because success does not attend their first efforts. Perseverance and a  careful study of the directions given, will assuredly bring success to  all who possess the natural or acquired qualities essential for the  practice of that most useful of the arts,--\"Healthful Cookery.\"    ELLA E. KELLOGG.    _Battle Creek, April 20, 1892._          Foods    The purposes of food are to promote growth, to supply force and heat,  and to furnish material to repair the waste which is constantly taking  place in the body. Every breath, every thought, every motion, wears out  some portion of the delicate and wonderful house in which we live.  Various vital processes remove these worn and useless particles; and to  keep the body in health, their loss must be made good by constantly  renewed supplies of material properly adapted to replenish the worn and  impaired tissues. This renovating material must be supplied through the  medium of food and drink, and the best food is that by which the desired  end may be most readily and perfectly attained. The great diversity in  character of the several tissues of the body, makes it necessary that  food should contain a variety of elements, in order that each part may  be properly nourished and replenished.    THE FOOD ELEMENTS.--The various elements found in food are the  following: Starch, sugar, fats, albumen, mineral substances,  indigestible substances.    The digestible food elements are often grouped, according to their  chemical composition, into three classes; _vis._, carbonaceous,  nitrogenous, and inorganic. The carbonaceous class includes starch,  sugar, and fats; the nitrogenous, all albuminous elements; and the  inorganic comprises the mineral elements.    _Starch_ is only found in vegetable foods; all grains, most vegetables,  and some fruits, contain starch in abundance. Several kinds of _sugar_  are made in nature's laboratory; _cane_, _grape_, _fruit_, and _milk_  sugar. The first is obtained from the sugar-cane, the sap of maple  trees, and from the beet root. Grape and fruit sugars are found in most  fruits and in honey. Milk sugar is one of the constituents of milk.  Glucose, an artificial sugar resembling grape sugar, is now largely  manufactured by subjecting the starch of corn or potatoes to a chemical  process; but it lacks the sweetness of natural sugars, and is by no  means a proper substitute for them. _Albumen_ is found in its purest,  uncombined state in the white of an egg, which is almost wholly composed  of albumen. It exists, combined with other food elements, in many other  foods, both animal and vegetable. It is found abundant in oatmeal, and  to some extent in the other grains, and in the juices of vegetables. All  natural foods contain elements which in many respects resemble  _albumen_, and are so closely allied to it that for convenience they are  usually classified under the general name of \"albumen.\" The chief of  these is _gluten_, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. _Casein_,  found in peas, beans, and milk, and the _fibrin_ of flesh, are elements  of this class.    _Fats_ are found in both animal and vegetable foods. Of animal fats,  butter and suet are common examples. In vegetable form, fat is abundant  in nuts, peas, beans, in various of the grains, and in a few fruits, as  the olive. As furnished by nature in nuts, legumes, grains, fruits, and  milk, this element is always found in a state of fine subdivision, which  condition is the one best adapted to its digestion. As most commonly  used, in the form of free fats, as butter, lard, etc., it is not only  difficult of digestion itself, but often interferes with the digestion  of the other food elements which are mixed with it. It was doubtless  never intended that fats should be so modified from their natural  condition and separated from other food elements as to be used as a  separate article of food. The same may be said of the other carbonaceous  elements, sugar and starch, neither of which, when used alone, is  capable of sustaining life, although when combined in a proper and  natural manner with other food elements, they perform a most important  part in the nutrition of the body. Most foods contain a percentage of  the _mineral_ elements. Grains and milk furnish these elements in  abundance. The cellulose, or woody tissue, of vegetables, and the bran  of wheat, are examples of _indigestible_ elements, which although they  cannot be converted into blood in tissue, serve an important purpose by  giving bulk to the food.    With the exception of gluten, none of the food elements, when used  alone, are capable of supporting life. A true food substance contains  some of all the food elements, the amount of each varying in different  foods.    USES OF THE FOOD ELEMENTS.--Concerning the purpose which these  different elements serve, it has been demonstrated by the experiments of  eminent physiologists that the carbonaceous elements, which in general  comprise the greater bulk of the food, serve three purposes in the body;    1. They furnish material for the production of heat;    2. They are a source of force when taken in connection with other food  elements;    3. They replenish the fatty tissues of the body. Of the carbonaceous  elements,--starch, sugar, and fats,--fats produce the greatest amount of  heat in proportion to quantity; that is, more heat is developed from a  pound of fat than from an equal weight of sugar or starch; but this  apparent advantage is more than counterbalanced by the fact that fats  are much more difficult of digestion than are the other carbonaceous  elements, and if relied upon to furnish adequate material for bodily  heat, would be productive of much mischief in overtaxing and producing  disease of the digestive organs. The fact that nature has made a much  more ample provision of starch and sugars than of fats in man's natural  diet, would seem to indicate that they were intended to be the chief  source of carbonaceous food; nevertheless, fats, when taken in such  proportion as nature supplies them, are necessary and important food  elements.    The nitrogenous food elements especially nourish the brain, nerves,  muscles, and all the more highly vitalized and active tissues of the  body, and also serve as a stimulus to tissue change. Hence it may be  said that a food deficient in these elements is a particularly poor  food.    The inorganic elements, chief of which are the phosphates, in the  carbonates of potash, soda, and lime, aid in furnishing the requisite  building material for bones and nerves.    PROPER COMBINATIONS OF FOODS.--While it is important that our food  should contain some of all the various food elements, experiments upon  both animals and human beings show it is necessary that these elements,  especially the nitrogenous and carbonaceous, be used in certain definite  proportions, as the system is only able to appropriate a certain amount  of each; and all excess, especially of nitrogenous elements, is not only  useless, but even injurious, since to rid the system of the surplus  imposes an additional task upon the digestive and excretory organs. The  relative proportion of these elements necessary to constitute a food  which perfectly meets the requirements of the system, is six of  carbonaceous to one of nitrogenous. Scientists have devoted much careful  study and experimentation to the determination of the quantities of each  of the food elements required for the daily nourishment of individuals  under the varying conditions of life, and it has come to be commonly  accepted that of the nitrogenous material which should constitute one  sixth of the nutrients taken, about _three ounces_ is all that can be  made use of in twenty-four hours, by a healthy adult of average weight,  doing a moderate amount of work. Many articles of food are, however,  deficient in one or the other of these elements, and need to be  supplemented by other articles containing the deficient element in  superabundance, since to employ a dietary in which any one of the  nutritive elements is lacking, although in bulk it may be all the  digestive organs can manage, is really starvation, and will in time  occasion serious results.    It is thus apparent that much care should be exercised in the selection  and combination of food materials.

Hope is the thing with feathers  That perches in the soul,  And sings the tune without the words,  And never stops at all,    And sweetest in the gale is heard;  And sore must be the storm  That could abash the little bird  That kept so many warm.    I 've heard it in the chillest land,  And on the strangest sea;  Yet, never, in extremity,  It asked a crumb of me.            VII.    THE WHITE HEAT.    Dare you see a soul at the white heat?     Then crouch within the door.  Red is the fire's common tint;     But when the vivid ore    Has sated flame's conditions,     Its quivering substance plays  Without a color but the light     Of unanointed blaze.    Least village boasts its blacksmith,     Whose anvil's even din  Stands symbol for the finer forge     That soundless tugs within,    Refining these impatient ores     With hammer and with blaze,  Until the designated light     Repudiate the forge.            VIII.    TRIUMPHANT.    Who never lost, are unprepared  A coronet to find;  Who never thirsted, flagons  And cooling tamarind.    Who never climbed the weary league --  Can such a foot explore  The purple territories  On Pizarro's shore?    How many legions overcome?  The emperor will say.  How many colors taken  On Revolution Day?    How many bullets bearest?  The royal scar hast thou?  Angels, write \"Promoted\"  On this soldier's brow!            IX.    THE TEST.    I can wade grief,  Whole pools of it, --  I 'm used to that.  But the least push of joy  Breaks up my feet,  And I tip -- drunken.  Let no pebble smile,  'T was the new liquor, --  That was all!    Power is only pain,  Stranded, through discipline,  Till weights will hang.  Give balm to giants,  And they 'll wilt, like men.  Give Himmaleh, --  They 'll carry him!            X.    ESCAPE.    I never hear the word \"escape\"  Without a quicker blood,  A sudden expectation,  A flying attitude.    I never hear of prisons broad  By soldiers battered down,  But I tug childish at my bars, --  Only to fail again!              XI.    COMPENSATION.    For each ecstatic instant  We must an anguish pay  In keen and quivering ratio  To the ecstasy.    For each beloved hour  Sharp pittances of years,  Bitter contested farthings  And coffers heaped with tears.            XII.    THE MARTYRS.    Through the straight pass of suffering  The martyrs even trod,  Their feet upon temptation,  Their faces upon God.    A stately, shriven company;  Convulsion playing round,  Harmless as streaks of meteor  Upon a planet's bound.    Their faith the everlasting troth;  Their expectation fair;  The needle to the north degree  Wades so, through polar air.            XIII.    A PRAYER.    I meant to have but modest needs,  Such as content, and heaven;  Within my income these could lie,  And life and I keep even.    But since the last included both,  It would suffice my prayer  But just for one to stipulate,  And grace would grant the pair.    And so, upon this wise I prayed, --  Great Spirit, give to me  A heaven not so large as yours,  But large enough for me.    A smile suffused Jehovah's face;  The cherubim withdrew;  Grave saints stole out to look at me,  And showed their dimples, too.    I left the place with all my might, --  My prayer away I threw;  The quiet ages picked it up,  And Judgment twinkled, too,    That one so honest be extant  As take the tale for true  That \"Whatsoever you shall ask,  Itself be given you.\"    But I, grown shrewder, scan the skies  With a suspicious air, --  As children, swindled for the first,  All swindlers be, infer.            XIV.    The thought beneath so slight a film  Is more distinctly seen, --  As laces just reveal the surge,  Or mists the Apennine.            XV.    The soul unto itself  Is an imperial friend, --  Or the most agonizing spy  An enemy could send.    Secure against its own,  No treason it can fear;  Itself its sovereign, of itself  The soul should stand in awe.            XVI.    Surgeons must be very careful  When they take the knife!  Underneath their fine incisions  Stirs the culprit, -- Life!            XVII.    THE RAILWAY TRAIN.    I like to see it lap the miles,  And lick the valleys up,  And stop to feed itself at tanks;  And then, prodigious, step    Around a pile of mountains,  And, supercilious, peer  In shanties by the sides of roads;  And then a quarry pare    To fit its sides, and crawl between,  Complaining all the while  In horrid, hooting stanza;  Then chase itself down hill    And neigh like Boanerges;  Then, punctual as a star,  Stop -- docile and omnipotent --  At its own stable door.            XVIII.    THE SHOW.    The show is not the show,  But they that go.  Menagerie to me  My neighbor be.  Fair play --  Both went to see.            XIX.    Delight becomes pictorial  When viewed through pain, --  More fair, because impossible  That any gain.    The mountain at a given distance  In amber lies;  Approached, the amber flits a little, --  And that 's the skies!            XX.    A thought went up my mind to-day  That I have had before,  But did not finish, -- some way back,  I could not fix the year,    Nor where it went, nor why it came  The second time to me,  Nor definitely what it was,  Have I the art to say.    But somewhere in my soul, I know  I 've met the thing before;  It just reminded me -- 't was all --  And came my way no more.            XXI.    Is Heaven a physician?  They say that He can heal,  But medicine posthumous     Is unavailable.    Is Heaven an exchequer?     They speak of what we owe;  But that negotiation     I 'm not a party to.            XXII.    THE RETURN.    Though I get home how late, how late!  So I get home, 't will compensate.  Better will be the ecstasy  That they have done expecting me,  When, night descending, dumb and dark,  They hear my unexpected knock.  Transporting must the moment be,  Brewed from decades of agony!    To think just how the fire will burn,  Just how long-cheated eyes will turn  To wonder what myself will say,  And what itself will say to me,  Beguiles the centuries of way!            XXIII.    A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,  That sat it down to rest,  Nor noticed that the ebbing day  Flowed silver to the west,  Nor noticed night did soft descend  Nor constellation burn,  Intent upon the vision  Of latitudes unknown.    The angels, happening that way,  This dusty heart espied;  Tenderly took it up from toil  And carried it to God.  There, -- sandals for the barefoot;  There, -- gathered from the gales,  Do the blue havens by the hand  Lead the wandering sails.            XXIV.    TOO MUCH.    I should have been too glad, I see,  Too lifted for the scant degree     Of life's penurious round;  My little circuit would have shamed  This new circumference, have blamed     The homelier time behind.    I should have been too saved, I see,  Too rescued; fear too dim to me     That I could spell the prayer  I knew so perfect yesterday, --  That scalding one, \"Sabachthani,\"     Recited fluent here.    Earth would have been too much, I see,  And heaven not enough for me;     I should have had the joy  Without the fear to justify, --  The palm without the Calvary;     So, Saviour, crucify.    Defeat whets victory, they say;  The reefs in old Gethsemane     Endear the shore beyond.  'T is beggars banquets best define;  'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, --     Faith faints to understand.            XXV.    SHIPWRECK.    It tossed and tossed, --  A little brig I knew, --  O'ertook by blast,  It spun and spun,  And groped delirious, for morn.    It slipped and slipped,  As one that drunken stepped;  Its white foot tripped,  Then dropped from sight.    Ah, brig, good-night  To crew and you;  The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,  To break for you.            XXVI.    Victory comes late,  And is held low to freezing lips  Too rapt with frost  To take it.  How sweet it would have tasted,  Just a drop!  Was God so economical?  His table 's spread too high for us  Unless we dine on tip-toe.  Crumbs fit such little mouths,  Cherries suit robins;  The eagle's golden breakfast  Strangles them.  God keeps his oath to sparrows,  Who of little love  Know how to starve!            XXVII.    ENOUGH.    God gave a loaf to every bird,  But just a crumb to me;  I dare not eat it, though I starve, --  My poignant luxury  To own it, touch it, prove the feat  That made the pellet mine, --  Too happy in my sparrow chance  For ampler coveting.    It might be famine all around,  I could not miss an ear,  Such plenty smiles upon my board,  My garner shows so fair.  I wonder how the rich may feel, --  An Indiaman -- an Earl?  I deem that I with but a crumb  Am sovereign of them all.            XXVIII.    Experiment to me  Is every one I meet.  If it contain a kernel?  The figure of a nut    Presents upon a tree,  Equally plausibly;  But meat within is requisite,  To squirrels and to me.            XXIX.    MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.    My country need not change her gown,  Her triple suit as sweet  As when 't was cut at Lexington,  And first pronounced \"a fit.\"    Great Britain disapproves \"the stars;\"  Disparagement discreet, --  There 's something in their attitude  That taunts her bayonet.            XXX.    Faith is a fine invention  For gentlemen who see;  But microscopes are prudent  In an emergency!            XXXI.    Except the heaven had come so near,  So seemed to choose my door,  The distance would not haunt me so;  I had not hoped before.    But just to hear the grace depart  I never thought to see,  Afflicts me with a double loss;  'T is lost, and lost to me.            XXXII.    Portraits are to daily faces  As an evening west  To a fine, pedantic sunshine  In a satin vest.            XXXIII.    THE DUEL.    I took my power in my hand.  And went against the world;  'T was not so much as David had,  But I was twice as bold.    I aimed my pebble, but myself  Was all the one that fell.  Was it Goliath was too large,  Or only I too small?   "]]]
