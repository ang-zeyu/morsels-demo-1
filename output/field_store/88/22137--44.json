I venture to think that were England to adopt compulsory military  service in some shape or form, we should hear a great deal less of the  unemployed and \"don't-want-work\" demonstrations.    To attempt to give a picture of Argentine life is impossible in the  short time at my disposal. Imagine to yourself, if you can, a country of  1,212,600 square miles whose borders extend from well within the Tropics  to away down south to the everlasting snows, embracing all kinds of  lands, from the very richest of soils to ice-capped and rocky peaks, and  you must admit that to attempt to describe the various conditions of  life therein is wellnigh impossible. Life is much what the surrounding  conditions make it--on the extreme edge of cultivation it is distinctly  rough, on the inner camps refinement steps in, and in the cities you  will find just what society you wish. Amongst the cosmopolitan  population of Buenos Aires there are many men and women of the highest  culture and education.    There are many Argentines, who stand out prominently from the throng of  busy pleasure-seekers, who are devoting their lives to improving the  surroundings of those less fortunate fellow-creatures who have fallen  upon the thorny path, and whose portion is often the cup of bitterness.  Indeed, I have ever found the Argentine desirous of helping those who  seek advice and assistance; but he spurns the foreigner who degrades  himself and his country by acts of folly which would not be permitted in  his native land.    Englishmen often fall into the great error of keeping themselves to  themselves. Possibly this trait is engendered from birth and training by  our insular position, but it is a great pity to carry it too far, for  the Argentine people do appreciate the thoroughness of our countrymen,  and are ready to welcome the right sort. We have taught the Argentines  many of our national sports and games, and they have entered into them  with such thoroughness that the teachers have often had to admit that  the pupil has proved better than the master.    Travelling has become an integral part of the education of the Argentine  family to-day, and it is quite general to find young children speaking  fluently four or five languages.    I could wish that those who have Argentine friends would insist upon  their seeing, when in this country, some of the Englishman's home  surroundings, for hotel life, theatres, dinners, and music-halls are all  very well in their way, but to see the real inwardness of English life  you must follow the Englishman to his country home. My experience is  that the Argentine will always refuse an invitation to your home at  first, because of the trouble which he believes you will be put to, but  don't take \"no\" for an answer; simply make him come, and he will thank  you afterwards for his experience of English home life.    Just a word or two, for fear I have left an impression that Argentina is  the El Dorado which lies beyond the seas. There are such things as  locusts, floods, droughts, and frosts in that country.    The first of these--locusts--are indeed a plague which to-day it seems  almost impossible to annihilate, for I have little faith in man's  attempts effectually to stop or decrease this pestilence; on the other  hand, Nature always seems to be on the alert to prevent an overthrow of  the balance of things. Those who have spent their lives in the River  Plate district have seen this appalling plague crushed by means which  Nature, in her own good time, has thought fit to use.    With regard to floods and droughts, these can, at least, be modified by  men, and means are now being adopted to conserve the floods and render  their waters available in time of drought.    From frosts we seem powerless to defend ourselves, and it is only those  whose work is in close touch with the growing and handling of crops who  can fully appreciate the damage done by late frosts.    No country is free from drawbacks of some sort or another, and these  troubles which I have just mentioned will not prevent the forward march  of progress in Argentina.

In the years 1881 and 1882, Messrs. C. de Murrieta & Co. acquired a  block of land from the Government of the Province of Santa Fe, and in  December, 1882, sold one undivided half-share thereof to Messrs. Kohn,  Reinach & Co. Messrs. Murrieta & Co. and Messrs. Kohn, Reinach & Co.,  having decided to develop the said lands, formed the Santa Fe Land  Company, and the prospectus appeared in July, 1883.    The area sold to the new Company was said to comprise about 650 Spanish  leagues, or 4,336,150 English acres, and the price to be paid to the  vendors was L1,050 per league.    In order to provide a port of shipment on the Rio Parana the Company  bought a further lot of 323 acres in the Colony of Romang.    In addition to the original block of land, the Company has since bought  the following areas:--    The estancia of La Barrancosa, 10,801 hectareas, say      26,678    The estancia of Santa Catalina, 4,049 hectareas, say      10,002    A strip of land at Guaycuru on the eastern boundary  of the Company's forest lands, 1,636 hectareas, say        4,041    A piece of land at Venado Tuerto, 37 hectareas, say           91    A piece of land at Arrufo, 100 hectareas, say                247    A piece of land at Tostado, 50 hectareas, say                123                                                              41,182    Since the beginning of the Company the total area of land sold has  amounted to 709,549 acres (up to 30th June, 1910). It is calculated  that the land comprised in the Bazan claim, to which reference is made  later on, measures 582,914 acres. Upon this supposition the Company now  owns 3,044,100 acres.    The original price paid for the Company's lands worked out at about 3s.  an acre.    The original capital of the Company was L875,000, of which over L675,566  was paid to the vendors, leaving a balance of L199,434 to meet the  preliminary expenses and the initial cost of opening up the new  properties. After some years it was found necessary to write off a  portion of the capital, and accordingly, in 1897, the Company's lands  were re-valued at approximately 2s. 9d. an acre.    The present Directors of the Company are:--    Mr. CAMPBELL P. OGILVIE (_Chairman_).  Mr. IVOR BEVAN.  Mr. GORDON H. BROWN.  LORD HAWKE.  Mr. LOUIS H. KIEK.  Mr. T.E. PRESTON.  Capt. The Hon. F.C. STANLEY.    The London Office is at 779, Salisbury House, Finsbury Circus, London,  E.C., and the Secretary of the Company is Mr. David Simpson. The Head  Office in the Argentine is at 761, Avenida de Mayo, Buenos Aires, and  the following are the principal officers of the Company in Argentina:--    Mr. HUGH M. RATTRAY (_General Manager_).  Mr. W.B. WHIGHAM (_Manager of the Cattle  and Lands Department at Sun Cristobal_).  Mr. R.N. LAND (_Manager at Santa Catalina_).  Mr. T. SCOTT ROBSON (_Manager at La Barrancosa_).  Mr. G.L.C. GITTINS (_Acting Manager of the Woods Department_).        SHARE CAPITAL.    The original shares of the Company were L10 each. It was decided in 1897  to reduce them to L7 fully paid, which placed the capital at L612,500.  Shortly afterwards each L7 share was converted into seven shares of L1  each.    In 1906 the shareholders authorised the creation of L200,000 of fresh  capital, which was issued to them in two blocks of L154,000 in 1906 and  L46,000 in 1907.    Fresh capital was authorised in 1908, viz., L187,500, of which L161,608  was issued in 1909, and further lots have since been issued, bringing  the total amount of authorised capital to L1,000,000, and of issued  capital at 30th June, 1910, to L982,347.    An issue of L50,000 Six per Cent. Debentures was made in January, 1904;  and the whole amount was redeemed on the 1st July, 1909.      BAZAN LANDS.    Part of the area sold to the Company consisted of a block of  approximately 88 Spanish leagues, or 530,000 English acres, which became  the subject of negotiations and lawsuits between this Company, the  Provincial Government of Santa Fe, and other parties, lasting for more  than twenty-five years. The area in question lay to the West of the Rio  Salado, and, at the time when this Company was formed, was supposed to  be included in the Province of Santa Fe. Soon afterwards the Province of  Santiago del Estero put forward a claim to the lands on the ground that  the boundaries of that Province extended eastwards to the Rio Salado,  and it therefore disputed the right of the Province of Santa Fe to sell  the lands to Messrs. Murrieta & Co. in 1882.    By an Agreement with the Government of the Province of Santa Fe, the  Santa Fe Land Company took proceedings in the Supreme Courts of the  Province to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#7)"],[1,"turned their heart back again.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 9, col. 2.        The twofold invocation of Elijah, which betokens his intense      earnestness, anagrammatically expressed, is echoed in the words      of the bystanders, \"The Lord He is the God, the Lord He is the      God.\"    \"I dreamed,\" said Bar Kappara one day to Rabbi (the Holy), \"that I  beheld two pigeons, and they flew away from me.\" \"Thy dream is this,\"  replied Rabbi, \"thou hast had two wives, and art separated from them  both without a bill of divorcement.\"    Ibid., fol. 56, col. 2.    The Rabbis teach concerning the two kidneys in man, that one counsels  him to do good and the other to do evil; and it appears that the former  is situated on the right side and the latter on the left. Hence it is  written (Eccl. x. 2), \"A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a  fool's heart is at his left.\"    Ibid., fol. 61, col. 1.    For two sins the common people perish: they speak of the holy ark as a  box and the synagogue as a resort for the ignorant vulgar.    _Shabbath_, fol. 32, col. 1.    On the self-same day when Jeroboam introduced the two golden calves, the  one into Bethel and the other into Dan, a hut was erected in a part of  Italy which was then subject to the Greeks.    Ibid., fol. 56, col. 2.        In the context where the above tradition occurs, which, as is      obvious, relates to the founding of Rome, we meet with another      on the same subject as follows:--When Solomon married the      daughter of Pharaoh, the Angel Gabriel thrust a reed into the      sea, stirring up therewith the sand and mud from the bottom.      This, gradually collecting, first shaped itself into an island      and then expanded so as to unite itself with the continent. And      thus was the land created for the erection of the hut which      should one day swell into the proportion of a proud imperial      city.    If Israel kept only two Sabbaths, according to the strict requirement of  the law, they would be freed at once from their compelled dispersion;  for it is written (Isa. lvi. 4, 7), \"Thus saith the Lord unto the  eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, Even them will I bring to my holy  mountain.\"    _Shabbath_, fol. 118, col. 2.    Adam had two faces; for it is said (Ps. cxxxix. 5), \"Thou hast made me  behind and before.\"    _Eiruvin_, fol. 18, col. 1.        There is a notion among the Rabbis that Adam was possessed      originally of a bisexual organization, and this conclusion they      draw from Gen. i. 27, where it is said, \"God created man in his      own image; male-female created He them.\" These two natures, it      was thought, lay side by side; according to some, the male on      the right and the female on the left; according to others, back      to back; while there were those who maintained that Adam was      created with a tail, and that it was from this appendage Eve was      fashioned. Other Jewish traditions tell us that Eve was made      from \"the thirteenth rib of the right side\" (Targ. Jonath.), and      that \"she was not drawn out by the head, lest she should be      vain; nor by the eyes, lest she should be wanton; nor from the      mouth, lest she should be given to garrulity; nor by the ears,      lest she should be an eavesdropper; nor by the hands, lest she      should be intermeddling; nor by the feet, lest she be a gadder;      nor by the heart, for fear she should be jealous; but she was      taken out from the side. Yet, in spite of all these precautions,      she had all the faults so carefully provided against.\"    If in time of national calamity a man withdraw himself from his kindred  and refuse to share in their sorrow, his two guardian angels come and  lay their hands upon his head and say, \"This man has isolated himself  from his country in the day of its need, let him not live to see and  enjoy the day when God shall restore its prosperity.\" When the community  is in trouble, let no man say, \"I will go home and eat and drink, and  say, Peace be unto thee, oh my soul!\" (Luke xii. 19); for to him  Scripture hath solemnly said (Isa. xxii. 13, 14), \"Surely this iniquity  shall not be purged from you till you die.\"    _Taanith_, fol. 11, col. 1.    An infant that has died under a month old is (to be) carried to the  grave in the arms (not in a coffin), and buried by one woman and two  men, but not by one man and two women.    _Moed Katan_, fol. 24, col. 1.        Both Rashi and the Tosephoth allude to a case which justifies      the rule given here, where a woman actually carried a living      child in a coffin, in order to avoid the suspicion of an      assignation she had made with a man, who set out to join her.      But the Tosephoth, after noticing this version of Rashi, gives      another more to the point. The story in the Tosephoth is to this      effect:--A woman was once weeping and groaning over the grave of      her husband, and not very far away was a man who was guarding      the corpse of a person who had been crucified. In the moment of      mourning an affection sprung up between the two, and in the      engrossment of it the corpse which the man guarded was stolen.      He was in great trepidation for fear of the king's command. The      woman said, \"Don't be afraid; exhume my husband, and hang him up      instead.\" This was accordingly done. (See _Kiddushin_, fol. 80,      col. 2.)    There were two date trees in the Valley of Hinnom from between which  smoke ascended, and this is the gate of hell.    _Succah_, fol. 32, col. 2.        According to Jewish tradition, there are three gates to      Gehinnom, one in the desert, one in the sea, and one in      Jerusalem: In the desert, as it is written (Numb. xvi. 33),      \"They went down, and all that belonged to them, alive into      hell.\" In the sea, as it is written (Jonah ii. 2), \"Out of the      belly of hell have I called,\" etc. In Jerusalem, as it is      written (Isa. xxxi. 9), \"Thus saith the Lord, whose fire is in      Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.\"    When two women are seen sitting on opposite sides of a cross road facing  each other, it is to be presumed that they are up to witchcraft and  contemplate mischief. What in that case must you do? Go by another road,  if there is one, and if not, with a companion, should such turn up,  passing the crones arm-in-arm with him; but should there be no other  road and no other man, then walk straight on repeating the  counter-charm, as you pass them--      Agrath is to Asia gone,    And Blussia's killed in battle.    _P'sachim_, fol. 111, col. 2.        Agrath and Blussia are two Amazons well known to those familiar      with Rabbinic demonology.    \"If Mordecai, before whom thou hast began to fall, be of the seed of the  Jews, expect not to prevail against him, but thou shalt fall\" (Esth. vi.  13). Wherefore these two fallings? They told Haman, saying, \"This nation  is likened to the dust, and is also likened to the stars; when they are  down, they are down even to the dust, but when they begin to rise, they  rise to the stars.\"    _Meggillah_, fol. 16, col. 1.    If any two disciples of the wise, dwelling in the same city, have a  difference respecting the Halachah, let them remember what Scripture  denounces against them, \"And also I gave them statutes that are not  good, and judgments by which they shall not live\" (Ezek. xx. 25).    Ibid., fol. 32, col. 1.    If a man espouse one of two sisters, and does not know which he has  espoused, he must give both a bill of divorce. If two men espouse two  sisters, and neither of them know which he has espoused, then each man  must give two bills of divorce, one to each woman.    _Yevamoth_, fol. 23, col. 2.    There is a time coming (i.e., in the days of the Messiah), when a grain  of wheat will be as large as the two kidneys of the great ox.    _Kethuboth_, fol. 111, col. 1.        According to a recent discovery, which has been confirmed by      subsequent observation and experiment, wheat is a development by      cultivation of the tiny grain of the _AEgilops ovata_, a sort of      grass; but we are indebted to Rabbinic lore for the curious      information that before the Fall of man wheat grew upon a tree      whose trunk looked like gold, its branches like silver, and its      leaves like so many emeralds. The wheat ears themselves were as      red as rubies, and each bore five sparkling grains as white as      snow, as sweet as honey, and as fragrant as musk. At first the      grains were as big as an ostrich's egg, but in the time of Enoch      they diminished to the size of a goose's egg, and in Elijah's to      that of a hen, while at the commencement of the common era, they      shrank so small as not to be larger than grapes, according to a      law the inverse of the order of nature. Rabbi Yehudah      (_Sanhedrin_, fol. 70, col. 1) says that wheat was the forbidden      fruit. Hence probably the degeneracy.    Of two that quarrel, the one that first gives in shows the nobler  nature.    Ibid., fol. 71, col. 2.    He who sets aside a portion of his wealth for the relief of the poor  will be delivered from the judgment of hell. Of this the parable of the  two sheep that attempted to ford a river is an illustration; one was  shorn of its wool and the other not; the former, therefore, managed to  get over, but the latter, being heavy-laden, sank.    _Gittin_, fol. 7, col. 1.    Zoreah and Eshtaol (Josh. xv. 33) were two large mountains, but Samson  tore them up and grated the one against the other.    _Soteh_, fol. 9, col. 2.        The above tradition is founded on Judges xiii. 25, in which it      is said of Samson, \"And the spirit of God began to move him at      times in the camp of Dan, between Zoreah and Eshtaol,\" in which      the word \"move,\" signifies also to \"strike a stroke,\" \"step a      step,\" and \"once.\" Founding on which last two meanings, Rabbi      Yehudah says, \"Samson strode in one stride from Zoreah to      Eshtaol,\""]]]
