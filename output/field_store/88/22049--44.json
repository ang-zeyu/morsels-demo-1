I had repeated this a number of times, even quirting some  cattle along the outside, or burning a little powder in the face of  some obstinate leader, when across the herd and to the rear I saw a  succession of flashes like fireflies, which told me the boys were  coming to our assistance.    Running is not a natural gait with cattle, and if we could only hold  them together and prevent splitting up, in time they would tire, while  the rear cattle could be depended on to follow the leaders. All we  could hope to do was to force them to run straight, and in this  respect we were succeeding splendidly, though to a certain extent it  was a guess in the dark. When they had run possibly a mile, I noticed  a horseman overtake Priest. After they had ridden together a moment,  one of them came over to my point, and the next minute our foreman was  racing along by my side. In his impatience to check the run, he took  me with him, and circling the leaders we reached the left point, by  which time the remainder of the outfit had come up. Now massing our  numbers, we fell on the left point, and amid the flash of guns  deflected their course for a few moments. A dozen men, however, can  cover but a small space, and we soon realized that we had turned only  a few hundred head, for the momentum of the main body bore steadily  ahead. Abandoning what few cattle we had turned, which, owing to their  running ability, soon resumed their places in the lead, we attempted  to turn them to the left. Stretching out our line until there was a  man about every twenty feet, we threw our force against the right  point and lead in the hope of gradually deviating their course. For a  few minutes the attempt promised to be successful, but our cordon was  too weak and the cattle went through between the riders, and we soon  found a portion of our forces on either side of the herd, while a few  of the boys were riding out of the rush in the lead.    On finding our forces thus divided, the five or six of us who remained  on the right contented ourselves by pointing in the leaders, for the  cattle, so far as we could tell, were running compactly. Our foreman,  however, was determined to turn the run, and after a few minutes' time  rejoined us on the right, when under his leadership we circled the  front of the herd and collected on the left point, when, for a third  time, we repeated the same tactics in our efforts to turn the  stampede. But in this, which was our final effort, we were attempting  to turn them slowly and on a much larger circle, and with a promise of  success. Suddenly in the dark we encountered a mesquite thicket into  which the lead cattle tore with a crashing of brush and a rattle of  horns that sent a chill up and down my spine. But there was no time to  hesitate, for our horses were in the thicket, and with the herd  closing in on us there was no alternative but to go through it, every  man for himself. I gave Nigger a free rein, shutting my eyes and  clutching both cantle and pommel to hold my seat; the black responded  to the rowel and tore through the thicket, in places higher than my  head, and came out in an open space considerably in the lead of the  cattle.    This thicket must have been eight or ten rods wide, and checked the  run to a slight extent; but as they emerged from it, they came out in  scattering flies and resumed their running. Being alone, and not  knowing which way to turn, I rode to the right and front and soon  found myself in the lead of quite a string of cattle. Nigger and I  were piloting them where they listed, when Joe Stallings, hatless  himself and his horse heaving, overtook me, and the two of us gave  those lead cattle all the trouble we knew how. But we did not attempt  to turn them, for they had caught their wind in forcing the thicket,  and were running an easy stroke. Several times we worried the leaders  into a trot, but as other cattle in the rear came up, we were  compelled to loosen out and allow them to resume their running, or  they would have scattered on us like partridges. At this stage of the  run, we had no idea where the rest of the outfit were, but both of us  were satisfied the herd had scattered on leaving the mesquite thicket,  and were possibly then running in half a dozen bunches like the one we  were with.    Stallings's horse was badly winded, and on my suggestion, he dropped  out on one side to try to get some idea how many cattle we were  leading. He was gone some little time, and as Nigger cantered along  easily in the lead, I managed to eject the shells from my six-shooter  and refill the cylinder. On Joe's overtaking me again, he reported  that there was a slender column of cattle, half a mile in length,  following. As one man could easily lead this string of the herd until  daybreak, I left Stallings with them and rode out to the left nearly a  quarter of a mile, listening to hear if there were any cattle running  to the left of those we were leading. It took me but a few minutes to  satisfy myself that ours was the outside band on the left, and after I  rejoined Joe, we made an effort to check our holding.    There were about fifty or sixty big steers in the lead of our bunch,  and after worrying them into a trot, we opened in their front with our  six-shooters, shooting into the ground in their very faces, and were  rewarded by having them turn tail and head the other way. Taking  advantage of the moment, we jumped our horses on the retreating  leaders, and as fast as the rear cattle forged forward, easily turned  them. Leaving Joe to turn the rear as they came up, I rode to the  lead, unfastening my slicker as I went, and on reaching the turned  leaders, who were running on an angle from their former course,  flaunted my \"fish\" in their faces until they reentered the rear guard  of our string, and we soon had a mill going which kept them busy, and  rested our horses. Once we had them milling, our trouble, as far as  running was concerned, was over, for all two of us could hope to do  was to let them exhaust themselves in this endless circle.    It then lacked an hour of daybreak, and all we could do was to ride  around and wait for daylight. In the darkness preceding dawn, we had  no idea of the number of our bunch, except as we could judge from the  size and compactness of the milling cattle, which must have covered an  acre or more. The humidity of the atmosphere, which had prevailed  during the night, by dawn had changed until a heavy fog, cutting off  our view on every hand, left us as much at sea as we had been  previously. But with the break of day we rode through our holding a  number of times, splitting and scattering the milling cattle, and as  the light of day brightened, we saw them quiet down and go to grazing  as though they had just arisen from the bed ground. It was over an  hour before the fog lifted sufficiently to give us any idea as to our  whereabouts, and during the interim both Stallings and myself rode to  the nearest elevation, firing a number of shots in the hope of getting  an answer from the outfit, but we had no response.    When the sun was sufficiently high to scatter the mists which hung in  clouds, there was not an object in sight by which we could determine  our location. Whether we had run east, west, or south during the night  neither of us knew, though both Stallings and myself were satisfied  that we had never crossed the trail, and all we did know for a  certainty was that we had between six and seven hundred head of  cattle. Stallings had lost his hat, and I had one sleeve missing and  both outside pockets torn out of my coat, while the mesquite thorns  had left their marks on the faces of both of us, one particularly ugly  cut marking Joe's right temple. \"I've worn leggins for the last ten  years,\" said Stallings to me, as we took an inventory of our  disfigurements, \"and for about ten seconds in forcing that mesquite  thicket was the only time I ever drew interest on my investment.  They're a heap like a six-shooter--wear them all your life and never  have any use for them.\"    With a cigarette for breakfast, I left Joe to look after our bunch,  and after riding several miles to the right, cut the trail of quite a  band of cattle. In following up this trail I could easily see that  some one was in their lead, as they failed to hold their course in any  one direction for any distance, as free cattle would. After following  this trail about three miles, I sighted the band of cattle, and on  overtaking them, found two of our boys holding about half as many as  Stallings had. They reported that The Rebel and Bob Blades had been  with them until daybreak, but having the freshest horses had left them  with the dawn and ridden away to the right, where it was supposed the  main body of the herd had run. As Stallings's bunch was some three or  four miles to the rear and left of this band, Wyatt Roundtree  suggested that he go and pilot in Joe's cattle, as he felt positive  that the main body were somewhere to our right. On getting directions  from me as to where he would find our holding, he rode away, and I  again rode off to the right, leaving Rod Wheat with their catch.    The sun was now several hours high, and as my black's strength was  standing the test bravely, I cross-cut the country and was soon on  another trail of our stampeded cattle. But in following this trail, I  soon noticed two other horsemen preceding me. Knowing that my services  would be too late, I only followed far enough to satisfy myself of the  fact. The signs left by the running cattle were as easy to follow as a  public road, and in places where the ground was sandy, the sod was cut  up as if a regiment of cavalry had charged across it. On again bearing  off to the right, I rode for an elevation which ought to give me a  good view of the country. Slight as this elevation was, on reaching  it, I made out a large band of cattle under herd,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12809"],[0,"Quiet Talks about Jesus (#7)"],[1,", of a missionary pausing long enough in a village to tell  the story of Jesus to the crowd that gathered, and then pushing on. This  was the first visit of a missionary to this place and so the first news of  Jesus. The crowd listened eagerly with various results. There was one  listener, an old man, held in repute for his wisdom, who at once accepted  the missionary's story, and announced his acceptance of Jesus. His  neighbors expressed their surprise at his prompt acceptance of such a new  thing. The old man's quiet answer in effect was this: \"Oh, I have long  trusted this Jesus, but I never knew His name before.\" There was no change  of purpose with this man, but, in the story of Jesus, the burst of light  that brought unspeakable peace as he kept on in his upward tug.    Yet all this will not hold back from glad sacrifice, from free giving,  from eager going to foreign mission lands a single man or woman who has  been caught by Jesus' Spirit. _The Master said, \"Go ye_.\" That's enough.  For the largest wealth that may be given, for the keenest sacrifice that  may be endured, for the strongest life that may be devoted--that is quite  enough. And if more were needed--then to go, to give, to sacrifice for the  sake of helping our struggling brothers yonder know Jesus, and His  wondrous sacrifice and His _great peace_. To make them conscious of the  disgustingness of sin, to bring to them _a vision of Jesus' face_ to  allure, and enchain, to give a man's will an earnest boost, when he  _-would_ choose, but cannot seem to for the suction of sin, inherited and  ever growing upon his choosing powers. God sent _His_ best. Jesus  sacrificed His all in going. We'll gladly follow in such a train. Jesus is  God sending His best, sacrificing His dearest, giving His most, _going  Himself_ to get men started up the hill out of the bog.        <u>The Broken Tryst.</u>      Man's break back in Eden was very hard on God. That evening early, in the  twilight, God came walking in the garden to have the usual talk with His  friend. He came to keep tryst. It was the usual trysting place and  trysting hour, and God had the trysting spirit. We may think He came early  for this bit of fellowship. He was prompt. Nothing would be allowed to  disturb this appointment. But God was disappointed. It was His first  disappointment. The first one to be disappointed on this earth was God.  Adam had always met Him before. We may easily think met Him eagerly,  jubilantly, with glad, free, open face and clinging hands.    But the man was not there this time. He failed God. He broke tryst. He  stayed away. Indeed he had gone away. God didn't fail. He was there. The  man failed. They had a long distance talk. God called Adam. He was not  content to come to the trysting place. He must find the missing tryster.  Some folk would make God a sort of hard and dry keeper of His word: A sort  of trim syllogism, dry as punk. Some seem to think Him to be as they seem  to be. How our poor God has been slandered by His supposed defenders! God  was not satisfied to keep the appointment. _He wanted the man._ He  hungered for His friend, upon whom He had imprinted His own image. His  heart was hungry for fellowship. He wanted the comfort of a bit of talk.  So He starts at once eagerly, insistently to find the man.    That voice of God spoke out, tender, gentle, plaintive, pleading. You can  just hear the soft, very soft woodsman's cry, \"Hello-alo, hello, Adam,  A-a-dam--here I am--waiting for you--I've kept my tryst--where are  _you_?--hello-o--hello--_where_--are--you?\" The voice that spoke worlds  into being, that brought life and beauty to all creation, that brought  instant reverence and adoration from myriads of the upper world, that  voice now speaks to one, two: two who were one. All the heart of God, all  the power of God, in the soft voice talking to one man. God has always  been after the one man, and still is.    And the breezes hushed to hear that voice with its new pleading tone. The  birds stilled their song for this new music in minor mellowing tone.  Silence for a moment, the breezes hushed, the birds stilled, the creation  near by held its breath, God held _His heart still_, that He might catch  the first response to its cry. The twilight of that day had a pathetic  sight. It saw a broken tryst; a lonely God; words of fellowship unspoken.  A man and woman hiding. Skulking behind trees. Trees served a new purpose  that evening, not a good purpose. They never were meant to hide behind.  Sin perverts the use of all things.    All these weary years God has been standing wherever men are: standing,  waiting, calling man back to his tryst. Among the trees, in the crowded  city of man's making, He is ever calling, and eagerly, wondrously, helping  every one who answers. He is so near that a reaching hand always touches  Him. The voice of the heart never misses His ear. But His love and grief  shine out most on that bit of a hill, outside a city wall, on the east  coast of the middle-of-the-earth sea. That is earth's tallest hill. It can  be seen farthest away of any. Jesus up on that hill is God calling man  back to his broken tryst.        <u>God's Wooing.</u>      God seems to have fairly outdone Himself to get man to turn toward the old  trysting place. For when a man will turn around enough to get even a  glimpse of that God-Face, and a whisper of that God-Voice, he can  withstand no longer.    God has taxed all the ingenuity of His love to let man know about Himself.  He revealed Himself directly to the whole race at the start. He has in  every generation, and in every clime, on every hilltop and valley, in  every village and crowded city, been revealing Himself to the heart of  every man. There cannot be found one anywhere who has not heard the quiet  inner voice drawing up, and away from wrong.    In this world of wondrous beauty God is speaking. The glory-telling  heavens, the winsome coloring of trees and all growing things, the soft  round hills, the sublime mountains, the sea with its ever-changing mood  but never-changing beneficence upon the life of the whole earth, the great  blue and gray above, the soothing green below, the brighter colors in  their artistic proportion, the wondrous blendings--surely every bush and  other green thing, every bright twinkler in the blue, everything is aflame  with the presence that burns but in great love consumes not. His eyes are  indeed badly bothered that cannot see; his ears in queer fix that do not  hear. Yet sometimes the empty shoes seem few enough. But they are ever  increasing, and will yet more and more, by retail method, with wholesale  result.    But God comes closer yet in His wooing. The web of life's daily run, with  its strange mixing and blending, shadings and tints, is of His weaving.  He sits at life's loom ever watching and weaving. Were He but recognized  oftener and His hand allowed to guide the skein, how different the  weaving!        \"Children of yesterday,        Heirs of to-morrow,      What are you weaving--        Labor and sorrow?      Look to your looms again;        Faster and faster      Fly the great shuttles        Prepared by the Master.      _Life's in the loom,        Room for it_--_room_!        \"Children of yesterday,        Heirs of to-morrow,      Lighten the labor        And sweeten the sorrow:      Now--while the shuttles fly        Faster and faster,      Up and be at it--        At work _with_ the Master.      _He stands at your loom_,        _Room for Him_--_room_!        \"Children of yesterday,        Heirs of to-morrow,      Look at your fabric        Of labor and sorrow.      Seamy and dark        With despair and disaster,      Turn it--and lo,        The design of the Master.      _The Lord's at the loom_,        _Room for Him--room_.\"[4]    When men's eyes seemed unable to see clearly these revelations of  Himself, God picked out a small tribe, and through long, patient,  painstaking discipline, gave to it, for the whole world, a special  revelation of Himself. In it, in the Book which preserves its records, in  the Man who came through it, God came nearer yet.    In Jesus, God told out His greatness most, and His love most tenderly. Man  is the fairest flower of earth's creation. It was love's fine touch that  to him God should reveal Himself best and most in the fairest flower of  the eternal creation. Only man could fully appreciate Jesus, God's Man,  and man's Brother.    But Jesus was known only to one generation--His own generation--to one  narrow strip of country, one peculiarly exclusive tribe, the very small  majority of all to whom He had come. So there came to be a Book that all  after-generations might know Him too. We of later generations know _of_  Jesus through the Book, in some shape or other, before we can come to know  Himself direct. And so we prize the Book above all others. Not for the  Book's sake, at all, of course, but because through it we come to know  Jesus. With loving reverence we handle it, for it tells of Him, our  God-brother.    Some learned folk have been much taken up with the make-up of the Book,  its paper and type, and punctuation, and binding. And they have done good  service in clearing away a lot of dust and cobwebs that had been gathering  on it for a long time. But we plain folk, absorbed in getting things  done, do not need to wait on their conclusions. If in those pages we have  found Jesus, and God in Jesus, the Book has fulfilled its mission to us.    To all directly, in nature's voice, and in our common daily life; to a  nation chosen for the special purpose, and through that nation and its  books; through Jesus to those who knew Him, and, by a Book telling of Him,  to all following, God came, _comes_ in His wooing, and looked, _looks_  tenderly into man's face. Each of these paths leads straight to God, and  each comes to include the others.    But chiefly in Jesus God came. Jesus is God going out"]]]
