This is the way she did it.    2. Jessie had gone to the woods with Jamie and Joe to get green branches  to trim up the house for Christmas. She wore her little cap, her white  furs, and her red leggings.    [Illustration: Three girls carrying a small Christmas tree.]    3. She was a merry little girl, indeed; but she felt sad this morning  because her mother had said, \"The children will all have Christmas  presents, but I don't expect any for myself. We are too poor this year.\"    4. When Jessie told her brothers this, they all talked about it a great  deal. \"Such a good, kind mamma, and no Christmas present! It's too bad.\"    5. \"I don't like it,\" said little Jessie, with a tear in her eye.    6.  \"Oh, she has you,\" said Joe.    7. \"But I am not something new,\" said Jessie.    8. \"Well, you will be new, Jessie,\" said Joe, \"when you get back. She has  not seen you for an hour.\"    9. Jessie jumped and laughed. \"Then put me in the basket, and carry me to  mamma, and say, 'I am her Christmas present.' \"    10. So they set her in the basket, and put green branches all around her.  It was a jolly ride. They set her down on the doorstep, and went in and  said, \"There's a Christmas present out there for you, mamma.\"    11. Mamma went and looked, and there, in a basket of green branches, sat  her own little laughing girl.    12. \"Just the very thing I wanted most,\" said mamma.    13. \"Then, dear mamma,\" said Jessie, bounding out of her leafy nest, \"I  should think it would be Christmas for mammas all the time, for they see  their little girls every day.\"        LESSON XLV.    pur'ple    plumes    pail       hap'pened    coat    shal'low   wad'ed    Charles    nap          yes'ter day      [Illustration: Two girls playing in water; two boats are beached on the  sand behind them.]      MARY'S STORY.    1. Father, and Charles, and Lucy, and I went to the beach yesterday. We  took our dinner, and stayed all day.    2. Father and Charles went out a little way from the shore in a boat, and  fished, while Lucy and I gathered sea mosses.    3. We took off our shoes and stockings, and waded into the shallow water.  We had a pail to put our seaweeds in.    4. We found such beautiful ones. Some wore purple, some pink, and some  brown. When they were spread out in the water, the purple ones looked like  plumes, and the brown ones like little trees.    5. Such a funny thing happened to Lucy. She slipped on a stone, and down  she went into the water. How we both laughed! But the wind and sun soon  dried Lucy's dress.    6. Then father came and took us in the boat for a row. After that we had a  picnic dinner in the woods.    7. Then father spread his coat on the grass, and took a nap while we  children played on the beach.

Ralph Wick was seven years old. In most things he was a fine boy, but  he was too apt to cry.    2. When he could not have what. he wanted, he would cry for it and say, \"I  will have it.\"    3. If he was told that it would hurt him, and he could not have it, he  would begin to tease and cry.    4. One day, he went with his mother into the fields. The sun shone. The  grass was cut. The flowers were in bloom.    5. Ralph thought he was, for once, a good boy. A smile was on his face. He  wished to do as he was told.    6. He said, \"Mother, I will be good now. I will do as you bid me. Please  let me toss this hay.\"    7. \"That I will,\" said his mother. So they threw the hay, as Ralph wished,  and he was very happy.    8. \"Now you must be tired,\" said his mother. \"Sit down here, and I will  get a nice red rose for you.\"    9. \"I would like to have one,\" said Ralph. So his mother brought the red  rose to him.    10. \"Thank you, mother,\" he said. \"But you have a white one, also. Please  give me that.\"    [Illustration: Mother and boy sitting in field.]    11. \"No, my dear,\" said his mother. \"See how many thorns it has on its  stem. You must not touch it. If you should try to pluck a rose like this,  you would be sure to hurt your hand.\"    12. When Ralph found that he could not have the white rose, he began to  scream, and snatched it. But he was soon very sorry. The thorns tore his  hand. It was so sore he could not use it for some time.    13. Ralph did not soon forget this. When he wanted what he should not  have, his mother would point to his sore hand. He at last learned to do as  he was told.

On a summer day, a man sitting on the bank of a river, in the shade of  some bushes, watched a flock of ducks on the stream.    2. Soon a branch with leaves came drifting among them, and they all took  wing. After circling in the air for a little time, they settled down again  on their feeding ground.    [Illustration: Fox watching ducks from a distance.]    3. Soon another branch came drifting down among them, and again they took  flight from the river; but when they found the branch had drifted by and  done them no harm, they flew down to the water as before.    4. After four or five branches had drifted by in this way, the ducks gave  little heed to them. At length, they hardly tried to fly out of their way,  even when the branches nearly touched them.    5. The man who had been watching all this, now began to wonder who had set  these branches adrift. He looked up the stream, and spied a fox slyly  watching the ducks. \"What will he do next?\" thought the man.    6. When the fox saw that the ducks were no longer afraid of the branches,  he took a much larger branch than any he had yet used, and stretched  himself upon it so as to be almost hidden. Then he set it afloat as he had  the others.    7. Right among the flock drifted the sly old fox, and, making quick snaps  to right and left, he seized two fine young ducks, and floated off with  them.    8. The rest of the flock flew away in fright, and did not come back for a  long time.    9. The fox must have had a fine dinner to pay him for his cunning, patient  work.

The kings of the city where the temple stood, and its  overseers, were called \"Boreads,\" and every nineteenth year the god  appeared dancing in the sky at the spring equinox.[68] The  identifications of the temple with Stonehenge and of the Boreads with  the Bards are quite hypothetical. Apollonius says that the Celts  regarded the waters of Eridanus as due to the tears of Apollo--probably  a native myth attributing the creation of springs and rivers to the  tears of a god, equated by the Greeks with Apollo.[69] The Celtic  sun-god, as has been seen, was a god of healing springs.    Some sixty names or titles of Celtic war-gods are known, generally  equated with Mars.[70] These were probably local tribal divinities  regarded as leading their worshippers to battle. Some of the names show  that these gods were thought of as mighty warriors, e.g. Caturix,  \"battle-king,\" Belatu-Cadros--a common name in Britain--perhaps meaning  \"comely in slaughter,\"[71] and Albiorix, \"world-king.\"[72] Another name,  Rigisamus, from _rix_ and _samus_, \"like to,\" gives the idea of  \"king-like.\"[73]    Toutatis, Totatis, and Tutatis are found in inscriptions from Seckau,  York, and Old Carlisle, and may be identified with Lucan's Teutates, who  with Taranis and Esus mentioned by him, is regarded as one of three  pan-Celtic gods.[74] Had this been the case we should have expected to  find many more inscriptions to them. The scholiast on Lucan identifies  Teutates now with Mars, now with Mercury. His name is connected with  _teuta_, \"tribe,\" and he is thus a tribal war-god, regarded as the  embodiment of the tribe in its warlike capacity.    Neton, a war-god of the Accetani, has a name connected with Irish _nia_,  \"warrior,\" and may be equated with the Irish war-god Net. Another god,  Camulos, known from British and continental inscriptions, and figured on  British coins with warlike emblems, has perhaps some connection with  Cumal, father of Fionn, though it is uncertain whether Cumal was an  Irish divinity.[75]    Another god equated with Mars is the Gaulish Braciaca, god of malt.  According to classical writers, the Celts were drunken race, and besides  importing quantities of wine, they made their own native drinks, e.g.  [Greek: chourmi], the Irish _cuirm_, and _braccat_, both made from malt  (_braich_).[76] These words, with the Gaulish _brace_, \"spelt,\"[77] are  connected with the name of this god, who was a divine personification of  the substance from which the drink was made which produced, according to  primitive ideas, the divine frenzy of intoxication. It is not clear why  Mars should have been equated with this god.    Caesar says that the Celtic Juppiter governed heaven. A god who carries a  wheel, probably a sun-god, and another, a god of thunder, called  Taranis, seem to have been equated with Juppiter. The sun-god with the  wheel was not equated with Apollo, who seems to have represented Celtic  sun-gods only in so far as they were also gods of healing. In some cases  the god with the wheel carries also a thunderbolt, and on some altars,  dedicated to Juppiter, both a wheel and a thunderbolt are figured. Many  races have symbolised the sun as a circle or wheel, and an old Roman  god, Summanus, probably a sun-god, later assimilated to Juppiter, had as  his emblem a wheel. The Celts had the same symbolism, and used the wheel  symbol as an amulet,[78] while at the midsummer festivals blazing  wheels, symbolising the sun, were rolled down a slope. Possibly the god  carries a thunderbolt because the Celts, like other races, believed that  lightning was a spark from the sun.    Three divinities have claims to be the god whom Caesar calls Dispater--a  god with a hammer, a crouching god called Cernunnos, and a god called  Esus or Silvanus. Possibly the native Dispater was differently envisaged  in different districts, so that these would be local forms of one god.    1. The god Taranis mentioned by Lucan is probably the Taranoos and  Taranucnos of inscriptions, sometimes equated with Juppiter.[79] These  names are connected with Celtic words for \"thunder\"; hence Taranis is a  thunder-god. The scholiasts on Lucan identify him now with Juppiter, now  with Dispater. This latter identification is supported by many who  regard the god with the hammer as at once Taranis and Dispater, though  it cannot be proved that the god with the hammer is Taranis. On one  inscription the hammer-god is called Sucellos; hence we may regard  Taranis as a distinct deity, a thunder-god, equated with Juppiter, and  possibly represented by the Taran of the Welsh tale of _Kulhwych_.[80]    Primitive men, whose only weapon and tool was a stone axe or hammer,  must have regarded it as a symbol of force, then of supernatural force,  hence of divinity. It is represented on remains of the Stone Age, and  the axe was a divine symbol to the Mycenaeans, a hieroglyph of Neter to  the Egyptians, and a worshipful object to Polynesians and Chaldeans. The  cult of axe or hammer may have been widespread, and to the Celts, as to  many other peoples, it was a divine symbol. Thus it does not necessarily  denote a thunderbolt, but rather power and might, and possibly, as the  tool which shaped things, creative might. The Celts made _ex voto_  hammers of lead, or used axe-heads as amulets, or figured them on altars  and coins, and they also placed the hammer in the hand of a god.[81]    The god with the hammer is a gracious bearded figure, clad in Gaulish  dress, and he carries also a cup. His plastic type is derived from that  of the Alexandrian Serapis, ruler of the underworld, and that of  Hades-Pluto.[82] His emblems, especially that of the hammer, are also  those of the Pluto of the Etruscans, with whom the Celts had been in  contact.[83] He is thus a Celtic Dispater, an underworld god, possibly  at one time an Earth-god and certainly a god of fertility, and ancestor  of the Celtic folk. In some cases, like Serapis, he carries a _modius_  on his head, and this, like the cup, is an emblem of chthonian gods, and  a symbol of the fertility of the soil. The god being benevolent, his  hammer, like the tool with which man forms so many things, could only be  a symbol of creative force.[84] As an ancestor of the Celts, the god is  naturally represented in Celtic dress. In one bas-relief he is called  Sucellos, and has a consort, Nantosvelta.[85] Various meanings have been  assigned to \"Sucellos,\" but it probably denotes the god's power of  striking with the hammer. M. D'Arbois hence regards him as a god of  blight and death, like Balor.[86] But though this Celtic Dispater was a  god of the dead who lived on in the underworld, he was not necessarily a  destructive god. The underworld god was the god from whom or from whose  kingdom men came forth, and he was also a god of fertility. To this we  shall return.    2. A bearded god, probably squatting, with horns from each of which  hangs a torque, is represented on an altar found at Paris.[87] He is  called Cernunnos, perhaps \"the horned,\" from _cerna_, \"horn,\" and a  whole group of nameless gods, with similar or additional attributes,  have affinities with him.    (a) A bronze statuette from Autun represents a similar figure, probably  horned, who presents a torque to two ram's-headed serpents. Fixed above  his ears are two small heads.[88] On a monument from Vandoeuvres is a  squatting horned god, pressing a sack. Two genii stand beside him on a  serpent, while one of them holds a torque.[89]    (b) Another squatting horned figure with a torque occurs on an altar  from Reims. He presses a bag, from which grain escapes, and on it an ox  and stag are feeding. A rat is represented on the pediment above, and on  either side stand Apollo and Mercury.[90] On the altar of Saintes is a  squatting but headless god with torque and purse. Beside him is a  goddess with a cornucopia, and a smaller divinity with a cornucopia and  an apple. A similar squatting figure, supported by male and female  deities, is represented on the other side of the altar.[91] On the altar  of Beaune are three figures, one horned with a cornucopia, another  three-headed, holding a basket.[92] Three figures, one female and two  male, are found on the Dennevy altar. One god is three-faced, the other  has a cornucopia, which he offers to a serpent.[93]    (c) Another image represents a three-faced god, holding a serpent with a  ram's head.[94]    (d) Above a seated god and goddess on an altar from Malmaison is a block  carved to represent three faces. To be compared with these are seven  steles from Reims, each with a triple face but only one pair of eyes.  Above some of these is a ram's head. On an eighth stele the heads are  separated.[95]    Cernunnos may thus have been regarded as a three-headed, horned,  squatting god, with a torque and ram's-headed serpent. But a horned god  is sometimes a member of a triad, perhaps representing myths in which  Cernunnos was associated with other gods. The three-headed god may be  the same as the horned god, though on the Beaune altar they are  distinct. The various representations are linked together, but it is not  certain that all are varying types of one god. Horns, torque, horned  snake, or even the triple head may have been symbols pertaining to more  than one god, though generally associated with Cernunnos.    The squatting attitude of the god has been differently explained, and  its affinities regarded now as Buddhist, now as Greco-Egyptian.[96] But  if the god is a Dispater, and the ancestral god of the Celts, it is  natural, as M. Mowat points out, to represent him in the typical  attitude of the Gauls when sitting, since they did not use seats.[97]  While the horns were probably symbols of power and worn also by chiefs  on their helmets,[98] they may also show that the god was an  anthropomorphic form of an earlier animal god, like the wolf-skin of  other gods."]]]
