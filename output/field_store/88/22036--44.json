Around Santa Cruz, indeed, there appeared but  little vegetation for which to be apprehensive, nor did the prospect  brighten till we came within view of the town named Laguna, an inland  settlement, and once the capital of the island.    For this place a party of us set forward on the 8th, mounted, according  to the custom of the country, upon mules or asses. Our route lay over  hills and mountains of rock continually ascending, until within a short  distance of the town, at which we arrived in between two and three hours  from our leaving Santa Cruz. The road over which we passed was wide, but  for the greatest part of it we travelled over loose stones that bore all  the appearance of cinders; in some places resembling a regular pavement,  and in others our beasts were compelled to scramble as well as they could  over the hard solid rock. We found that Laguna, which was somewhat better  than three English miles distant from Santa Cruz, had formerly been a  populous city; the streets were spacious, and laid out at right angles  with each other.    Here were two monasteries and as many convents. The monastery of St  Augustine we visited; and the good fathers of it with great civility  conducted us to their chapel, though it was preparing for the celebration  of some religious ceremony. We found the altar-piece, on which was  commonly displayed all their finery and taste, neat, light, and elegant.  Few paintings were to be seen; the best were half-lengths of some of the  saints disposed round the pulpit. The form of this building was a  quadrangle, the centre of which was laid out in garden-ground, elegantly  divided into walks, bordered with roses, myrtle, and a variety of other  shrubs and flowers. Hence we proceeded to the retreat of religious  females, but had not chosen the proper time for paying our respects,  which ceremony we therefore deferred until our return in the evening from  an excursion into the adjacent country.    The town of Laguna (a name which signifies Lake or Swamp) is situated  upon a plain surrounded by high hills, and watered by the same means as  Santa Cruz, from a great distance up the country. We noticed, indeed, two  stone-basins, and fountains playing in different streets of the place.  The buildings here had a manifest superiority over those of Santa Cruz,  the streets were far more spacious, and the houses larger. In some of the  former we perceived a regular line of shops filled chiefly with articles  from England. The insalubrity of the air of this place, however, had  driven, and was continuing to drive, such numbers almost daily from its  influence, that it had more the appearance of a deserted than of an  inhabited town, weeds and grass literally growing in the streets. As this  town decreased in its population, Santa Cruz, with some others on the  island, received the benefit; and it must be acknowledged, that although  in quitting Laguna they removed from fertile fields and a romantic  pleasant country, to uncouth and almost barren rocks at Santa Cruz, they  changed a noxious for a very healthy situation.    After viewing the town we remounted our beasts, and proceeded by the side  of the aqueduct into a most delightful country, where we found the people  cheerfully employed in gathering their harvest, and singing their rural  roundelays. The soil produced oats, barley, wheat, and Indian corn; but,  though it bore always two, and sometimes three crops, it was nevertheless  unequal in the whole of its produce to the consumption of the island, the  deficiency being supplied from the Grand Canary.    The sides of the hills were clothed with woods, into one of which we  rode, and arriving at a place named Il Plano de los Vieios, or the Plain  of the Old People, we rested for some little time, and afterward,  crossing through a cultivated valley, ascended the hill on the opposite  side, where we visited the source of the stream that supplied the  aqueduct. Returning thence, we refreshed under the walls of a small  chapel, where a friar occasionally performed mass for the neighbouring  country people. About five o'clock we again entered Laguna, with the  intention of paying our compliments to the sisterhood of the convent  which we had visited in the morning; but whether our party was too  numerous, or from what other cause it proceeded we could not learn, we  were only favoured with the company of four or five of the elder ladies  of the house, who talked very loud and very fast. After purchasing some  few bunches of artificial fruit, we took our leave, and proceeded to  Santa Cruz, cautiously indeed, down the hills and rocks which we had  ascended in the morning, and arrived about sun-set.    An outward-bound Dutch East-Indiaman had anchored in the road since the  morning.    In the evening of this day John Powers, a convict, made his escape from  the _Alexander_ transport, in a small boat which by some accident was  suffered to lie unattended to alongside the ship, with a pair of oars in  it; he was however retaken at day-break the next morning, by the activity  of the master and a party of marines belonging to the transport, and  brought on board the _Sirius_, whence he was removed to his own ship,  with directions for his being heavily ironed.    It appeared that he had at first conceived hopes of being received on  board the Dutch East India ship that arrived in the morning; but, meeting  with a disappointment there, rowed to the southern part of the island,  and concealed himself among the rocks, having first set his boat and oars  adrift, which fortunately led to a discovery of the place he had chosen  for his retreat. The Marquis de Branceforte, on hearing of his escape,  expressed the greatest readiness to assist in his recovery; and Captain  Phillip offered a considerable reward for the same purpose.    Having completed the provisioning and watering of the fleet, and being  again ready to proceed on our voyage, in the afternoon of Saturday the  9th the signal was made from the _Sirius_ for all boats to repair on  board; shortly after which she unmoored, and that night lay at single  anchor.    At daybreak the following morning the whole fleet got under way.

This island wore the same mountainous  appearance as its opposite neighbour Teneriffe, from which it seemed to  be divided by a space of about eleven leagues. Being the capital of the  Canary Islands, the chief bishop had his residence there, and evinced in  his diocese the true spirit of a primitive Christianity, by devoting to  pious and charitable purposes the principal part of a revenue of ten  thousand pounds _per annum_. The chief officers of justice also reside in  this island, before whom all civil causes are removed from Teneriffe and  the other Canary Islands, to be finally decided.    While detained in this spot, we had a very fine view of the Peak of  Teneriffe, lifting its venerable and majestic head above the neighbouring  hills, many of which were also of considerable height, and perhaps rather  diminished the grandeur of the Peak itself, the altitude of which we  understood was 15,396 feet, only 148 yards short of three miles.    On the 14th, the wind began to blow steady from the north-east; and on  the 15th, about eleven in the forenoon, we crossed the tropic of Cancer.  Our weather now became hot and close, and we rolled along through a very  heavy sea, the convoy, however, keeping well together.    At six o'clock in the morning of the 18th, the _Supply_, then ahead of  the fleet, made the signal for seeing land. The weather being very hazy,  we had but an indistinct view of the Isle of Sal, one of the Cape de Verd  islands, bearing NW by W 1/4 W distant eight leagues; and at one the same  day, we came in sight of the Island of Bonavista, bearing S.W. distant  two leagues.    Captain Phillip designing to anchor for a few hours at the Island of St.  Iago, to procure water and other refreshments, if he could get in without  any risk or difficulty, in the evening shortened sail, and made the  convoy's signal to close, the run from thence to that island being too  great to admit of our reaching it before dark. The _Supply_ was directed  at the same time to keep ahead with a light during the night; and at  twelve o'clock the night signal was made for the fleet to bring-to.    At six the next morning we made sail again, and soon after passed the  Isle of May, distant about four leagues, bearing NW by W of us. Between  nine and ten o'clock we made the south end of the Island of St. Iago and  at the distance of about two leagues. The wind freshening soon after we  saw the island, at noon we were ranging along the south side of it, with  the signal flying for the convoy to prepare to anchor; but at the moment  of our opening Praya-bay, and preparing to haul round the southern  extremity of it, the fleet was suddenly taken aback, and immediately  after baffled by light airs. We could however perceive, as well by the  colours at the fort, as by those of a Portuguese snow riding in the bay,  that the wind blew directly in upon the shore, which would have rendered  our riding there extremely hazardous; and as it was probable that our  coming to an anchor might not have been effected without some accident  happening to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#7)"],[1,"to riddles. The  children still used to sit frequently by the house of their rich  guardian, sometimes near the wagons, sometimes near the oven behind the  house, where they used to warm themselves, especially in the autumn.  Once Amrei asked:    \"What's the best thing about an oven?\"    \"You know I can't guess anything,\" replied Damie, plaintively.    \"Then I'll tell you:      'In the oven this is best, 'tis said,    That it never itself doth eat the bread.'\"    And then, pointing to the wagons before the house, Amrei asked:    \"What's full of holes, and yet holds? \"--and without waiting for a  reply, she gave the answer: \"A chain!\"    \"Now you must let me ask you these riddles,\" said Damie.    And Amrei replied: \"Yes, you may ask them. But do you see those sheep  coming yonder? Now I know another riddle.\"    \"No!\" cried Damie, \"no! Two are enough for me--I can't remember three!\"    \"Yes, you must hear this one too, or else I'll take the others back!\"    And Damie kept repeating to himself, anxiously: \"A chain,\" \"Eat it  itself,\" while Amrei asked:    \"On which side have sheep the most wool?\"--\"Ba! ba! on the outside!\" she  sang merrily.    Damie now ran off to ask his playmates these riddles; he kept his fists  tightly clenched, as if he were holding the riddles fast and was  determined not to let them go. But when he got to his playmates, he  remembered only the one about the chain; and Farmer Rodel's eldest son,  whom he hadn't asked at all and who was much too old for that sort of  thing, guessed the answer at once, and Damie ran back to his sister  crying.    Little Amrei's cleverness at riddles soon began to be talked about in  the village, and even rich, serious farmers, who seldom wasted many  words on anybody, and least of all on a poor child, now and then  condescended to ask little Amrei one. That she knew a great many herself  was not strange, for she had probably learned them from Black Marianne;  but that she was able to answer so many new ones caused general  astonishment. Amrei would soon have been unable to go across the street  or into the fields without being stopped and questioned, if she had not  found out a remedy; she made it a rule that she would not answer a  riddle for anybody, unless she might propose one in return, and she  managed to think up such good ones that the people stood still as if  spell-bound. Never had a poor child been so much noticed in the village  as was this little Amrei. But, as she grew older, less attention was  paid to her, for people look with sympathetic eyes only at the blossom  and the fruit, and disregard the long period of transition during which  the one is ripening into the other.    Before Amrei's school-days were over, Fate gave her a riddle that was  difficult to solve.    The children had an uncle, a woodcutter, who lived some fifteen miles  from Haldenbrunn, at Fluorn. They had seen him only once, and that was  at their parents' funeral, when he had walked behind the magistrate, who  had led the children by the hand. After that time the children often  dreamt about their uncle at Fluorn. They were often told that this uncle  was like their father, which made them still more anxious to see him;  for although they still believed at times that their father and mother  would some day suddenly reappear--it could not be that they had gone  away forever--still, as the years rolled on, they gradually became  reconciled to giving up this hope, especially after they had over and  over again put berries on the graves, and had long been able to read the  two names on the same black cross. They also almost entirely forgot  about the uncle in Fluorn, for during many years they had heard nothing  of him.    But one day the children were called into their guardian's house, and  there sat a tall, heavy man with a brown face.    \"Come here, children,\" said this man, as the children entered. \"Don't  you know me?\" He had a dry, harsh voice.    The children looked at him with wondering eyes. Perhaps some remembrance  of their father's voice awoke within them. The man continued:    \"I am your father's brother. Come here, Lisbeth, and you too, Damie.\"    \"My name's not Lisbeth--my name's Amrei,\" said the girl; and she began  to cry. She did not offer her hand to her uncle. A feeling of  estrangement made her tremble, when her own uncle thus called her by a  wrong name; she very likely felt that there could be no real affection  for her in anybody who did not know her name.    \"If you are my uncle, why don't you know my name?\" asked Amrei.    \"You are a stupid child! Go and offer him your hand immediately!\"  commanded Farmer Rodel. And then he said to the stranger, half in a  whisper: \"She's a strange child. Black Marianne, who, you know, is a  peculiar sort of person, has put all sorts of odd notions into her  head.\"    Amrei looked around in astonishment, and gave her hand to her uncle,  trembling. Damie, who had done so already, now said:    \"Uncle, have you brought us anything?\"    \"I haven't much to bring. I bring myself, and you're to go with me. Do  you know, Amrei, that it's not at all right for you not to like your  uncle. You'd better come here and sit down beside me--nearer still. You  see, your brother Damie is much more sensible. He looks more like our  family, but you belong to us too.\"    A maid now came in with some man's clothing, which she laid on the  table.    \"These are your brother's clothes,\" said Farmer Rodel to the stranger;  and the latter went on to say to Amrei:    \"As you see, these are your father's clothes. We shall take them with  us, and you shall go too--first to Fluorn, and then across the brook.\"    Amrei, trembling, touched her father's coat and his blue-striped vest.  But the uncle lifted up the clothes, pointed to the worn-out elbows, and  said to Farmer Rodel:    \"These are worth very little--I won't have them valued at much. I don't  even know if I can wear them over in America, without being laughed at.\"    Amrei seized the coat passionately. That her father's coat, which she  had looked upon as a costly and invaluable treasure, should be  pronounced of little value, seemed to grieve her, and that these clothes  were to be worn in America, and ridiculed there, almost bewildered her.  And, anyway, what was the meaning of this talk about America? This  mystery was soon cleared up, when Farmer Rodel's wife came, and with  her, Black Marianne; for Dame Rodel said:    \"Harkye, husband--to my mind this thing should not be done so fast, this  sending the children off to America with that man.\"    \"But he is their only living relative, Josenhans' brother.\"    \"Yes, to be sure. But until now he has not done much to show that he is  a relative; and I fancy that this cannot be done without the approval  of the Council, and even the Council cannot do it alone. The children  have a legal right to live here, which cannot be taken away from them in  their sleep, so to speak--for the children are not yet in a position to  say what they want themselves. It's like carrying people off in their  sleep.\"    \"My Amrei is intelligent enough. She's thirteen now, but more clever  than many a person of thirty, and she knows what she wants,\" said Black  Marianne.    \"You two ought to have been town-councilors,\" said Farmer Rodel. \"But  it's my opinion, too, that the children ought not to be tied to a rope,  like calves, and dragged away. Well, let the man talk with them himself,  and then we shall see what further is to be done. He is after all their  natural protector, and has the right to stand in their father's place,  if he likes. Harkye; do you take a little walk with your brother's  children outside the village, and you women stay here, and let nobody  try to persuade or dissuade them.\"    The woodcutter took the two children by the hand, and went out of the  room and out of the house with them. In the street he asked the  children:    \"Whither shall we go?\"    \"If you want to be our father, go home with us,\" suggested Damie. \"Our  house is down yonder.\"    \"Is it open?\" asked the uncle.    \"No, but Coaly Mathew has the key. But he has never let us go in. I'll  run on and get the key.\"    Damie released himself quickly, and ran off. Amrei felt like a prisoner  as her uncle led her along by the hand. He spoke earnestly and  confidentially to her now, however, and explained, almost as if he were  excusing himself, that he had a large family of his own and, that he  could hardly get along with his wife and five children. But now a man,  who was the owner of large forests in America, had offered him a free  passage across the ocean, and in five years, when he had cleared away  the forest, he was to have a large piece of the best farm-land as his  own property. In gratitude to God, who had bestowed this upon him for  himself and his family, he had immediately made up his mind to do a good  deed by taking his brother's children with him. But he was not going to  compel them to go; indeed, he would take them only on the condition that  they should turn to him with their whole hearts and look upon him as  their second father.    Amrei looked at him with eyes of wonder. If she could only bring herself  to love this man! But she was almost afraid of him--she could not help  it. And to have him thus fall from the clouds, as it were, and compel  her to love him, rather turned her against him.    \"Where is your wife?\" asked Amrei. She very likely felt that a woman  would have broached the subject in a more gentle and gradual manner.    \"I will tell you honestly,\" answered her uncle. \"My wife does not  interfere in this matter, and says she will neither persuade nor  dissuade me. She is a little sharp, but only at first--if you are good  to her, and you are a sensible child, you can twist her around your  finger. And if, once in a while, anything should happen to you that you  don't like, remember that you are at your father's brother's, and tell  me about"]]]
