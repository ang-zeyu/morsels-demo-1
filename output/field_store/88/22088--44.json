You will understand why  I have so much to say after hearing it.\"        \"'Says a proverb of Persia provoking mirth;        When this world was created by order divine.      Ten measures of talk were put down on the earth,        And the woman took nine.'\"    Speaking to Mary of life on the farm one day, Ralph laughingly said:  \"I am taught something new every day. Yesterday your Uncle told me it  was 'time to plant corn when oak leaves were large as squirrels'  ears.'\" Ralph worked like a Trojan. In a short time both his hands and  face took on a butternut hue. He became strong and robust. Mary called  him her \"Cave Man,\" and it taxed the combined efforts of Aunt Sarah  and Mary to provide food to satisfy the ravenous appetite Mary's \"Cave  Man\" developed. And often, after a busy day, tired but happy, Mary  fell asleep at night to the whispering of the leaves of the Carolina  poplar outside her bedroom window.    But country life on a farm has its diversions. One of Mary's and  Ralph's greatest pleasures after a busy day at the farm was a drive  about the surrounding country early Summer evenings, frequently  accompanied by either Elizabeth or Pauline Schmidt, their nearest  neighbors.    One of the first places visited by them was a freak of nature called  \"Rocky Valley,\" situated at no great distance from the farm.    [Illustration: PROFESSOR SCHMIDT]          CHAPTER VII    PROFESSOR SCHMIDT.      A small country place named \"Five Oaks,\" a short distance from \"Clear  Spring\" farm, was owned by a very worthy and highly-educated, but  rather eccentric, German professor. He came originally from  Heidelberg, but had occupied the position of Professor of German for  many years in a noted university in a near by town. A kind,  warm-hearted, old-fashioned gentleman was the Professor; a perfect  Lord Chesterfield in manners. Very tall, thin almost to emaciation,  although possessed of excellent health; refined, scholarly looking: a  rather long, hooked nose, faded, pale-blue eyes; snowy, flowing \"Lord  Dundreary\" whiskers, usually parted in the centre and twisted to a  point on either side with the exceedingly long, bony fingers of his  well-kept, aristocratic-looking white hands. He had an abrupt, quick,  nervous manner when speaking. A fringe of thin, white hair showed at  the lower edge of the black silk skull cap which he invariably wore  about home, and in the absence of this covering for his bald head, he  would not have looked natural to his friends.    The Professor always wore a suit of well-brushed, \"shiny\" black  broadcloth, and for comfort old-fashioned soft kid \"gaiters,\" with  elastic in the sides. He was a man with whom one did not easily become  acquainted, having very decided opinions on most subjects. He  possessed exquisite taste, a passionate love of music, flowers and all  things beautiful; rather visionary, poetical and a dreamer; he was not  practical, like his wife; warm-hearted, impulsive, energetic Frau  Schmidt, who was noted for her executive abilities. I can imagine the  old Professor saying as Mohammed has been quoted as saying, \"Had I two  loaves, I would sell one and buy hyacinths to feed my soul.\"  Impulsive, generous to a fault, quick to take offense, withal  warm-hearted, kind and loyal to his friends, he was beloved by the  students, who declared that \"Old Snitzy\" always played fair when he  was obliged to reprimand them for their numerous pranks, which ended  sometimes, I am obliged to confess, with disastrous results. The  dignified old Professor would have raised his mild, blue, spectacled  eyes in astonishment had he been so unfortunate as to have overheard  the boys, to whom he was greatly attached, call their dignified  preceptor by such a nickname.    The Professor's little black-eyed German wife, many years younger than  her husband, had been, before her marriage, teacher of domestic  science in a female college in a large city. \"She was a most excellent  housekeeper,\" to quote the Professor, and \"a good wife and mother.\"    The family consisted of \"Fritz,\" a boy of sixteen, with big, innocent,  baby-blue eyes like his father, who idolized his only son, who was  alike a joy and a torment. Fritz attended the university in a near-by  town, and was usually head of the football team. He was always at the  front in any mischief whatever, was noted for getting into scrapes  innumerable through his love of fun, yet he possessed such a  good-natured, unselfish, happy-go-lucky disposition that one always  forgave him.    Black-eyed, red-cheeked Elizabeth was quick and impulsive, like her  mother. A very warm and lasting friendship sprung up between merry  Elizabeth and serious Mary Midleton during Mary's Summer on the farm,  although not at all alike in either looks or disposition, and  Elizabeth was Mary's junior by several years.    The third, last and least of the Professor's children was Pauline, or  \"Pollykins,\" as she was always called by her brother Fritz, the  seven-year-old pet and baby of the family. A second edition of Fritz,  the same innocent, questioning, violet-blue eyes, fair complexion, a  kissable little mouth and yellow, kinky hair, she won her way into  every one's heart and became greatly attached to Mary, who was usually  more patient with the little maid (who, I must confess, was sometimes  very willful) than was her sister Elizabeth. Mary, who had never been  blessed with a sister, dearly loved children, and thought small  \"Polly\" adorable, and never wearied telling her marvelous fairy tales.    [Illustration: FRAU SCHMIDT]          CHAPTER VIII.    USES OF AN OLD-FASHIONED WARDROBE.      Shortly after Mary's advent at the farm she one day said: \"Aunt Sarah,  the contents of this old trunk are absolutely worthless to me; perhaps  they may be used by you for carpet rags.\"    \"Mary Midleton!\" exclaimed Aunt Sarah, in horrified tones, \"you  extravagant girl. I see greater possibilities in that trunk of  partly-worn clothing than, I suppose, a less economically-inclined  woman than I ever would have dreamed of.\"    Mary handed her Aunt two blue seersucker dresses, one plain, the other  striped. \"They have both shrunken, and are entirely too small for me,\"  said Mary.    \"Well,\" said her Aunt, considering, \"they might be combined in one  dress, but you need aprons for kitchen work more useful than those  little frilly, embroidered affairs you are wearing. We should make  them into serviceable aprons to protect your dresses. Mary, neatness  is an attribute that every self-respecting housewife should  assiduously cultivate, and no one can be neat in a kitchen without a  suitable apron to protect one from grime, flour and dust.\"    \"What a pretty challis dress; its cream-colored ground sprinkled over  with pink rose buds!\"    Mary sighed. \"I always did love that dress, Aunt Sarah, 'Twas so  becoming, and he--he--admired it so!\"    \"And HE, can do so still,\" replied Aunt Sarah, with a merry twinkle in  her kind, clear, gray eyes, \"for that pale-green suesine skirt,  slightly faded, will make an excellent lining, with cotton for an  interlining, and pale green Germantown yarn with which to tie the  comfortable. At small cost you'll have a dainty, warm spread which  will be extremely pretty in the home you are planning with HIM. I have  several very pretty-old-style patchwork quilts in a box in the attic  which I shall give you when you start housekeeping. That pretty  dotted, ungored Swiss skirt will make dainty, ruffled sash curtains  for bedroom windows. Mary, sometimes small beginnings make great  endings; if you make the best of your small belongings, some day your  homely surroundings will be metamorphosed into what, in your present  circumstances, would seem like extravagant luxuries. An economical  young couple, beginning life with a homely, home-made rag carpet, have  achieved in middle age, by their own energy and industry, carpets of  tapestry and rich velvet, and costly furniture in keeping; but,  never--never, dear, are they so valued, I assure you, as those  inexpensive articles, conceived by our inventive brain and  manufactured by our own deft fingers during our happy Springtime of  life when, with our young lover husband, we built our home nest on the  foundation of pure, unselfish, self-sacrificing love.\"    Aunt Sarah sighed; memory led her far back to when she had planned her  home with her lover, John Landis, still her lover, though both have  grown gray together, and shared alike the joys and sorrows of the  passing years. Aunt Sarah had always been the perfect \"housemother\" or  \"Haus Frau,\" as the Germans phrase it, and on every line of her  matured face could be read an anxious care for the family welfare.  Truly could it be said of her, in the language of Henry Ward Beecher:  \"Whoever makes home seem to the young dearer and happier is a public  benefactor.\"    Aunt Sarah said earnestly to Mary, \"I wish it were possible for me to  impart to young, inexperienced girls, about to become housewives and  housemothers, a knowledge of those small economics, so necessary to  health and prosperity, taught me by many years of hard work, mental  travail, experience and some failures. In this extravagant Twentieth  Century economy is more imperative than formerly. We feel that we need  so much more these days than our grandmothers needed; and what we  need, or feel that we need, is so costly. The housemother has larger  problems today than yesterday.    \"Every husband should give his wife an allowance according to his  income, so that she will be able to systematize her buying and  occasionally obtain imperishable goods at less cost. Being encouraged  thus to use her dormant economical powers; she will become a powerful  factor in the problem of home-making along "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#7)"],[1,"order, for thou shalt die, and not live.\"    The weather is sultry hot, accompanied by frequent thunder-showers,  which have not the effect one would expect, that of cooling the heated  atmosphere. I experience a degree of languor and oppression that is very  distressing, and worse than actual pain.    Instead of leaving this place by the first conveyance for the upper  province, as we fully purposed doing, we find ourselves obliged to  remain two days longer, owing to the dilatoriness of the custom-house  officers in overlooking our packages. The fact is that everything and  everybody are out of sorts.    The heat has been too oppressive to allow of my walking much abroad. I  have seen but little of the town beyond the streets adjacent to the  hotel: with the exception of the Catholic Cathedral, I have seen few of  the public buildings. With the former I was much pleased: it is a fine  building, though still in an unfinished state, the towers not having  been carried to the height originally intended. The eastern window,  behind the altar, is seventy feet in height by thirty-three in width.  The effect of this magnificent window from the entrance, the altar with  its adornments and paintings, the several smaller altars and shrines,  all decorated with scriptural designs, the light tiers of galleries that  surround the central part of the church, the double range of columns  supporting the vaulted ceiling, and the arched windows, all combine to  form one beautiful whole. What most pleased me was the extreme lightness  of the architecture though I thought the imitation of marble, with which  the pillars were painted, coarse and glaring. We missed the time-  hallowing mellowness that age has bestowed on our ancient churches and  cathedrals. The grim corbels and winged angels that are carved on the  grey stone, whose very uncouthness tells of time gone by when our  ancestors worshipped within their walls, give an additional interest to  the temples of our forefathers. But, though the new church at Montreal  cannot compare with our York Minster, Westminster Abbey, and others of  our sacred buildings, it is well worthy the attention of travellers, who  will meet with nothing equal to it in the Canadas.    There are several colleges and nunneries, a hospital for the sick,  several Catholic and Protestant churches, meeting-houses, a guard-house,  with many other public edifices.    The river-side portion of the town is entirely mercantile. Its narrow,  dirty streets and dark houses, with heavy iron shutters, have a  disagreeable appearance, which cannot but make an unfavourable  impression on the mind of a British traveller. The other portion of the  town, however, is of a different character, and the houses are  interspersed with gardens and pleasant walks, which looked very  agreeable from the windows of the ball-room of the Nelson Hotel. This  room, which is painted from top to bottom, the walls and ceiling, with a  coarse imitation of groves and Canadian scenery, commands a superb view  of the city, the river, and all surrounding country, taking in the  distant mountains of Chamblay, the shores of St. Laurence, towards La  Prairie, and the rapids above and below the island of St. Anne's. The  royal mountain (Mont Real), with its wooded sides, its rich scenery, and  its city with its streets and public buildings, lie at your feet: with  such objects before you the eye may well be charmed with the scenery of  Montreal.    We receive the greatest attention from the master of the hotel, who is  an Italian. The servants of the house are very civil, and the company  that we meet at the ordinary very respectable, chiefly emigrants like  ourselves, with some lively French men and women. The table is well  supplied, and the charges for board and lodging one dollar per day  each*.    [* This hotel is not of the highest class, in which the charge is a  dollar and a half per day. Ed.]    I am amused with the variety of characters of which our table is  composed. Some of the emigrants appear to entertain the most sanguine  hopes of success, appearing to foresee no difficulties in carrying their  schemes into effect. As a contrast to these there is one of my  countrymen, just returned from the western district on his way back to  England, who entreats us by no means to go further up this horrid  country, as he emphatically styles the Upper Province, assuring us he  would not live in it for all the land it contained.    He had been induced, by reading Cattermole's pamphlet on the subject of  Emigration, to quit a good farm, and gathering together what property he  possessed, to embark for Canada. Encouraged by the advice of a friend in  this country, he purchased a lot of wild land in the western district;  \"but sir,\" said he, addressing my husband with much vehemence, \"I found  I had been vilely deceived. Such land, such a country--I would not live  in it for all I could see. Why, there is not a drop of wholesome water  to be got, or a potato that is fit to eat. I lived for two months in a  miserable shed they call a shanty, eaten up alive with mosquitoes. I  could get nothing to eat but salted pork, and, in short, the discomforts  are unbearable. And then all my farming knowledge was quite useless--  people know nothing about farming in this country. Why, it would have  broken my heart to work among the stumps, and never see such a thing as  a well-ploughed field. And then,\" he added, in a softer tone, \"I thought  of my poor wife and the little one. I might, for the sake of bettering  my condition, have roughed out a year or so myself, but, poor thing, I  could not have had the heart to have brought her out from the comforts  of England to such a place, not so good as one of our cow-houses or  stables, and so I shall just go home; and if I don't tell all my  neighbours what sort of a country this is they are all crazing to throw  up their farms and come to, never trust a word of mine again.\"    It was to no purpose that some persons present argued with him on the  folly of returning until he had tried what could be done: he only told  them they were fools if they staid an hour in a country like this; and  ended by execrating those persons who deceived the people at home by  their false statements, who sum up in a few pages all the advantages,  without filling a volume with the disadvantages, as they might well do.    \"Persons are apt to deceive themselves as well as to be deceived,\" said  my husband; \"and having once fixed their minds on any one subject, will  only read and believe those things that accord with their wishes.\"    This young man was evidently disappointed in not finding all things as  fair and pleasant as at home. He had never reflected on the subject, or  he could not have been so foolish as to suppose he would encounter no  difficulties in his first outset, in a settlement in the woods. We are  prepared to meet with many obstacles, and endure considerable  privations, although I dare say we may meet with many unforeseen ones,  forewarned as we have been by our Canadian friend's letters.    Our places are taken in the stage for Lachine, and if all is well, we  leave Montreal to-morrow morning. Our trunks, boxes, &c. are to be sent  on by the forwarders to Cobourg.--August 22.    Cobourg, August 29.--When I closed my last letter I told you, my dear  mother, that we should leave Montreal by sunrise the following day; but  in this we were doomed to be disappointed, and to experience the truth  of these words: \"Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for thou knowest not  what an hour may bring forth.\" Early that very morning, just an hour  before sunrise, I was seized with the symptoms of the fatal malady that  had made so many homes desolate. I was too ill to commence my journey,  and, with a heavy heart, heard the lumbering wheels rattle over the  stones from the door of the hotel.    I hourly grew worse, till the sister of the landlady, an excellent young  woman, who had previously shown me great attention, persuaded me to send  for a physician; and my husband, distracted at seeing me in such agony,  ran off to seek for the best medical aid. After some little delay a  physician was found. I was then in extreme torture; but was relieved by  bleeding, and by the violent fits of sickness that ensued. I will not  dwell minutely on my sufferings, suffice to say, they were intense; but  God, in his mercy, though he chastened and afflicted me, yet gave me not  over unto death. From the females of the house I received the greatest  kindness. Instead of fleeing affrighted from the chamber of sickness,  the two Irish girls almost quarrelled which should be my attendant;  while Jane Taylor, the good young woman I before mentioned, never left  me from the time I grew so alarmingly ill till a change for the better  had come over me, but, at the peril of her own life, supported me in her  arms, and held me on her bosom, when I was struggling with mortal agony,  alternately speaking peace to me, and striving to soothe the anguish of  my poor afflicted partner.    The remedies applied were bleeding, a portion of opium, blue pill, and  some sort of salts--not the common Epsom. The remedies proved effectual,  though I suffered much from sickness and headache for many hours. The  debility and low fever that took place of the cholera obliged me to keep  my bed some days. During the two first my doctor visited me four times a  day; he was very kind, and, on hearing that I was the wife of a British  officer emigrating to the Upper Province, he seemed more than ever  interested in my recovery, evincing a sympathy for us that was very  grateful to our feelings. After a weary confinement of several days, I  was at last pronounced in a sufficiently convalescent state to begin my  journey, though still so weak that I was scarcely able to support  myself.    The sun had not yet risen when the stage that was to take us to Lachine,  the first "]]]
