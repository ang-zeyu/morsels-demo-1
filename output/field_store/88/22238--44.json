The same is true of _Love_, and the instinctive desire to please those  whom we love. The teacher who succeeds in getting herself loved by the  pupils will obtain results which one of a more forbidding temperament  finds it impossible to secure.    Next, a word might be said about _Curiosity_. This is perhaps a rather  poor term by which to designate the _impulse toward better cognition_ in  its full extent; but you will readily understand what I mean. Novelties  in the way of sensible objects, especially if their sensational quality  is bright, vivid, startling, invariably arrest the attention of the  young and hold it until the desire to know more about the object is  assuaged. In its higher, more intellectual form, the impulse toward  completer knowledge takes the character of scientific or philosophic  curiosity. In both its sensational and its intellectual form the  instinct is more vivacious during childhood and youth than in after  life. Young children are possessed by curiosity about every new  impression that assails them. It would be quite impossible for a young  child to listen to a lecture for more than a few minutes, as you are now  listening to me. The outside sights and sounds would inevitably carry  his attention off. And, for most people in middle life, the sort of  intellectual effort required of the average schoolboy in mastering his  Greek or Latin lesson, his algebra or physics, would be out of the  question. The middle-aged citizen attends exclusively to the routine  details of his business; and new truths, especially when they require  involved trains of close reasoning, are no longer within the scope of  his capacity.    The sensational curiosity of childhood is appealed to more particularly  by certain determinate kinds of objects. Material things, things that  move, living things, human actions and accounts of human action, will  win the attention better than anything that is more abstract. Here again  comes in the advantage of the object-teaching and manual training  methods. The pupil's attention is spontaneously held by any problem that  involves the presentation of a new material object or of an activity on  any one's part. The teacher's earliest appeals, therefore, must be  through objects shown or acts performed or described. Theoretic  curiosity, curiosity about the rational relations between things, can  hardly be said to awake at all until adolescence is reached. The  sporadic metaphysical inquiries of children as to who made God, and why  they have five fingers, need hardly be counted here. But, when the  theoretic instinct is once alive in the pupil, an entirely new order of  pedagogic relations begins for him. Reasons, causes, abstract  conceptions, suddenly grow full of zest, a fact with which all teachers  are familiar. And, both in its sensible and in its rational  developments, disinterested curiosity may be successfully appealed to in  the child with much more certainty than in the adult, in whom this  intellectual instinct has grown so torpid as usually never to awake  unless it enters into association with some selfish personal interest.  Of this latter point I will say more anon.    _Imitation_. Man has always been recognized as the imitative animal  _par excellence_. And there is hardly a book on psychology, however old,  which has not devoted at least one paragraph to this fact. It is  strange, however, that the full scope and pregnancy of the imitative  impulse in man has had to wait till the last dozen years to become  adequately recognized. M. Tarde led the way in his admirably original  work, \"Les Lois de l'Imitation\"; and in our own country Professors Royce  and Baldwin have kept the ball rolling with all the energy that could be  desired. Each of us is in fact what he is almost exclusively by virtue  of his imitativeness. We become conscious of what we ourselves are by  imitating others--the consciousness of what the others are precedes--the  sense of self grows by the sense of pattern. The entire accumulated  wealth of mankind--languages, arts, institutions, and sciences--is  passed on from one generation to another by what Baldwin has called  social heredity, each generation simply imitating the last. Into the  particulars of this most fascinating chapter of psychology I have no  time to go. The moment one hears Tarde's proposition uttered, however,  one feels how supremely true it is. Invention, using the term most  broadly, and imitation, are the two legs, so to call them, on which the  human race historically has walked.    Imitation shades imperceptibly into _Emulation_. Emulation is the  impulse to imitate what you see another doing, in order not to appear  inferior; and it is hard to draw a sharp line between the manifestations  of the two impulses, so inextricably do they mix their effects.  Emulation is the very nerve of human society. Why are you, my hearers,  sitting here before me? If no one whom you ever heard of had attended a  'summer school' or teachers' institute, would it have occurred to any  one of you to break out independently and do a thing so unprescribed by  fashion? Probably not. Nor would your pupils come to you unless the  children of their parents' neighbors were all simultaneously being sent  to school. We wish not to be lonely or eccentric, and we wish not to be  cut off from our share in things which to our neighbors seem desirable  privileges.    In the schoolroom, imitation and emulation play absolutely vital parts.  Every teacher knows the advantage of having certain things performed by  whole bands of children at a time. The teacher who meets with most  success is the teacher whose own ways are the most imitable. A teacher  should never try to make the pupils do a thing which she cannot do  herself. \"Come and let me show you how\" is an incomparably better  stimulus than \"Go and do it as the book directs.\" Children admire a  teacher who has skill. What he does seems easy, and they wish to emulate  it. It is useless for a dull and devitalized teacher to exhort her  pupils to wake up and take an interest. She must first take one herself;  then her example is effective, as no exhortation can possibly be.    Every school has its tone, moral and intellectual. And this tone is a  mere tradition kept up by imitation, due in the first instance to the  example set by teachers and by previous pupils of an aggressive and  dominating type, copied by the others, and passed on from year to year,  so that the new pupils take the cue almost immediately. Such a tone  changes very slowly, if at all; and then always under the modifying  influence of new personalities aggressive enough in character to set new  patterns and not merely to copy the old. The classic example of this  sort of tone is the often quoted case of Rugby under Dr. Arnold's  administration. He impressed his own character as a model on the  imagination of the oldest boys, who in turn were expected and required  to impress theirs upon the younger set. The contagiousness of Arnold's  genius was such that a Rugby man was said to be recognizable all through  life by a peculiar turn of character which he acquired at school. It is  obvious that psychology as such can give in this field no precepts of  detail. As in so many other fields of teaching, success depends mainly  on the native genius of the teacher, the sympathy, tact, and perception  which enable him to seize the right moment and to set the right example.    Among the recent modern reforms of teaching methods, a certain  disparagement of emulation, as a laudable spring of action in the  schoolroom, has often made itself heard. More than a century ago,  Rousseau, in his 'Emile,' branded rivalry between one pupil and another  as too base a passion to play a part in an ideal education. \"Let Emile,\"  he said, \"never be led to compare himself to other children. No  rivalries, not even in running, as soon as he begins to have the power  of reason. It were a hundred times better that he should not learn at  all what he could only learn through jealousy or vanity. But I would  mark out every year the progress he may have made, and I would compare  it with the progress of the following years. I would say to him: 'You  are now grown so many inches taller; there is the ditch which you jumped  over, there is the burden which you raised. There is the distance to  which you could throw a pebble, there the distance you could run over  without losing breath. See how much more you can do now!' Thus I should  excite him without making him jealous of any one. He would wish to  surpass himself. I can see no inconvenience in this emulation with his  former self.\"    Unquestionably, emulation with one's former self is a noble form of the  passion of rivalry, and has a wide scope in the training of the young.  But to veto and taboo all possible rivalry of one youth with another,  because such rivalry may degenerate into greedy and selfish excess, does  seem to savor somewhat of sentimentality, or even of fanaticism. The  feeling of rivalry lies at the very basis of our being, all social  improvement being largely due to it. There is a noble and generous kind  of rivalry, as well as a spiteful and greedy kind; and the noble and  generous form is particularly common in childhood. All games owe the  zest which they bring with them to the fact that they are rooted in the  emulous passion, yet they are the chief means of training in fairness  and magnanimity. Can the teacher afford to throw such an ally away?  Ought we seriously to hope that marks, distinctions, prizes, and other  goals of effort, based on the pursuit of recognized superiority, should  be forever banished from our schools? As a psychologist, obliged to  notice the deep and pervasive character of the emulous passion, I must  confess my doubts.    The wise teacher will use this instinct as he uses others, reaping its  advantages, and appealing to it in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#7)"],[1," whom the word is  nothing but the aggregate of its constitutive letters, to the view of  the grammarians who teach that over and above the aggregate of the  letters there exists a super-sensuous entity called 'spho/t/a,' which is  the direct cause of the apprehension of the sense of a word (Adhik. IX;  Sutras 26-33).    Adhik. X (34-38) explains that /S/udras are altogether disqualified for  Brahmavidya.    Sutra 39 constitutes, according to /S/a@nkara, a new adhikara/n/a (XI),  proving that the pra/n/a in which everything trembles, according to  /K/a/th/a Up. II, 6, 2, is Brahman.--According to Ramanuja the Sutra  does not introduce a new topic but merely furnishes an additional reason  for the decision arrived at under Sutras 24, 25, viz. that the  a@ngus/th/amatra is Brahman. On this supposition, Sutras 24-39 form one  adhikara/n/a in which 26-38 constitute a mere digression led up to by  the mention made of the heart in 25.--The a@ngus/th/matra is referred to  twice in the Ka/th/a Upanishad, once in the passage discussed (II, 4,  12), and once in II, 6, 17 ('the Person not larger than a thumb'). To  determine what is meant by the a@ngus/th/matra, Ramanuja says, we are  enabled by the passage II, 6, 2, 3, which is intermediate between the  two passages concerning the a@ngus/th/matra, and which clearly refers to  the highest Brahman, of which alone everything can be said to stand in  awe.    The next Sutra (40) gives rise to a similar difference of opinion.  According to /S/a@nkara it constitutes by itself a new adhikara/n/a  (XII), proving that the 'light' (jyotis) mentioned in Ch. Up. VIII, 12,  3 is the highest Brahman.--According to Ramanuja the Sutra continues the  preceding adhikara/n/a, and strengthens the conclusion arrived at by a  further argument, referring to Ka/th/a Up. II, 5, 15--a passage  intermediate between the two passages about the a@ngush/th/amatra--which  speaks of a primary light that cannot mean anything but Brahman. The  Sutra has in that case to be translated as follows: '(The  a@ngush/th/amatra is Brahman) because (in a passage intervening between  the two) a light is seen to be mentioned (which can be Brahman only).'    The three last Sutras of the pada are, according to /S/a@nkara, to be  divided into two adhikara/n/as (XIII and XIV), Sutra 41 deciding that  the ether which reveals names and forms (Ch. Up. VIII, 14) is not the  elemental ether but Brahman; and 42, 43 teaching that the vij/n/anamaya,  'he who consists of knowledge,' of B/ri/. Up. IV, 3, 7 is not the  individual soul but Brahman.--According to Ramanuja the three Sutras  make up one single adhikara/n/a discussing whether the Chandogya  Upanishad passage about the ether refers to Brahman or to the individual  soul in the state of release; the latter of these two alternatives being  suggested by the circumstance that the released soul is the subject of  the passage immediately preceding ('Shaking off all evil as a horse  shakes off his hair,' &c.). Sutra 41 decides that 'the ether (is  Brahman) because the passage designates the nature of something else,'  &c. (i.e. of something other than the individual soul; other because to  the soul the revealing of names and forms cannot be ascribed, &c.)--But,  an objection is raised, does not more than one scriptural passage show  that the released soul and Brahman are identical, and is not therefore  the ether which reveals names and forms the soul as well as  Brahman?--(The two, Sutra 42 replies, are different) 'because in the  states of deep sleep and departing (the highest Self) is designated as  different' (from the soul)--which point is proved by the same scriptural  passages which /S/a@nkara adduces;--and 'because such terms as Lord and  the like' cannot be applied to the individual soul (43). Reference is  made to IV, 4, 14, where all jagadvyapara is said to belong to the Lord  only, not to the soul even when in the state of release.      PADA IV.      The last pada of the first adhyaya is specially directed against the  Sa@nkhyas.    The first adhikara/n/a (1-7) discusses the passage Ka/th/a Up. I, 3, 10;  11, where mention is made of the Great and the Undeveloped--both of them  terms used with a special technical sense in the Sa@nkhya-/s/astra,  avyakta being a synonym for pradhana.--/S/a@nkara shows by an exhaustive  review of the topics of the Ka/th/a Upanishad that the term avyakta has  not the special meaning which the Sa@nkhyas attribute to it, but denotes  the body, more strictly the subtle body (sukshma /s/arira), but at the  same time the gross body also, in so far as it is viewed as an effect of  the subtle one.    Adhik. II (8-10) demonstrates, according to /S/a@nkara, that the  tricoloured aja spoken of in /S/ve. Up. IV, 5 is not the pradhana of the  Sankhyas, but either that power of the Lord from which the world  springs, or else the primary causal matter first produced by that  power.--What Ramanuja in contradistinction from /S/a@nkara understands  by the primary causal matter, follows from the short sketch given above  of the two systems.    Adhik. III (11-13) shows that the pa/nk/a pa/nk/ajana/h/ mentioned in  B/ri/. Up. IV, 4, 17 are not the twenty-five principles of the  Sa@nkhyas.--Adhik. IV (14, 15) proves that Scripture does not contradict  itself on the all-important point of Brahman, i.e. a being whose essence  is intelligence, being the cause of the world.    Adhik. V (16-18) is, according to /S/a@nkara, meant to prove that 'he  who is the maker of those persons, of whom this is the work,' mentioned  in Kau. Up. IV, 19, is not either the vital air or the individual soul,  but Brahman.--The subject of the adhikara/n/a is essentially the same in  Ramanuja's view; greater stress is, however, laid on the adhikara/n/a  being polemical against the Sa@nkhyas, who wish to turn the passage into  an argument for the pradhana doctrine.    The same partial difference of view is observable with regard to the  next adhikara/n/a (VI; Sutras 19-22) which decides that the 'Self to be  seen, to be heard,' &c. (B/ri/. Up. II, 4, 5) is the highest Self, not  the individual soul. This latter passage also is, according to Ramanuja,  made the subject of discussion in order to rebut the Sa@nkhya who is  anxious to prove that what is there inculcated as the object of  knowledge is not a universal Self but merely the Sa@nkhya purusha.    Adhik. VII (23-27) teaches that Brahman is not only the efficient or  operative cause (nimitta) of the world, but its material cause as well.  The world springs from Brahman by way of modification (pari/n/ama; Sutra  26).--Ramanuja views this adhikara/n/a as specially directed against the  Se/s/vara-sa@nkhyas who indeed admit the existence of a highest Lord,  but postulate in addition an independent pradhana on which the Lord acts  as an operative cause merely.    Adhik. VIII (28) remarks that the refutation of the Sa@nkhya views is  applicable to other theories also, such as the doctrine of the world  having originated from atoms.    After this rapid survey of the contents of the first adhyaya and the  succinct indication of the most important points in which the views of  /S/a@nkara and Ramanuja diverge, we turn to a short consideration of two  questions which here naturally present themselves, viz., firstly, which  is the principle on which the Vedic passages referred to in the Sutras  have been selected and arranged; and, secondly, if, where /S/a@nkara and  Ramanuja disagree as to the subdivision of the Sutras into  Adhikara/n/as, and the determination of the Vedic passages discussed in  the Sutras, there are to be met with any indications enabling us to  determine which of the two commentators is right. (The more general  question as to how far the Sutras favour either /S/a@nkara's or  Ramanuja's general views cannot be considered at present.)    The Hindu commentators here and there attempt to point out the reason  why the discussion of a certain Vedic passage is immediately followed by  the consideration of a certain other one. Their explanations--which have  occasionally been referred to in the notes to the translation--rest on  the assumption that the Sutrakara in arranging the texts to be commented  upon was guided by technicalities of the Mima/m/sa-system, especially by  a regard for the various so-called means of proof which the Mima/m/saka  employs for the purpose of determining the proper meaning and position  of scriptural passages. But that this was the guiding principle, is  rendered altogether improbable by a simple tabular statement of the  Vedic passages referred to in the first adhyaya, such as given by  Deussen on page 130; for from the latter it appears that the order in  which the Sutras exhibit the scriptural passages follows the order in  which those passages themselves occur in the Upanishads, and it would  certainly be a most strange coincidence if that order enabled us at the  same time to exemplify the various prama/n/as of the Mima/m/sa in their  due systematic succession.    As Deussen's statement shows, most of the passages discussed are taken  from the Chandogya Upanishad, so many indeed that the whole first  adhyaya may be said to consist of a discussion of all those Chandogya  passages of which it is doubtful whether they are concerned with Brahman  or not, passages from the other Upanishads being brought in wherever an  opportunity offers. Considering the prominent position assigned to the  Upanishad mentioned, I think it likely that the Sutrakara meant to begin  the series of doubtful texts with the first doubtful passage from the  Chandogya, and that hence the sixth adhikara/n/a which treats of the  anandamaya mentioned in the Taittiriya Upanishad has, in agreement with  Ramanuja's views, to be separated from the subsequent adhikara/n/as, and  to be combined with the preceding ones whose task it is to lay down the  fundamental propositions regarding Brahman's nature.--The remaining  adhikara/n/as"]]]
