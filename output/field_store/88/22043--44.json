Montcalm had lost no time in  accepting the challenge of the English, in the hope that his superior  numbers would make up for their inferiority in discipline and equipment  compared with the smaller English force. His expectations were never  realized. In a few minutes the French fell in hundreds before the steady  deadly fire of the English lines, and Montcalm was forced to retreat  precipitately with the beaten remnant of his army. Wolfe received  several wounds, and died on the battlefield, but not before he was  conscious of his victory. \"God be praised,\" were his dying words, \"I now  die in peace.\" His brave adversary was mortally wounded while seeking  the protection of Quebec, and was buried in a cavity which a shell had  made in the floor of the chapel of the Ursuline Convent. A few days  later Quebec capitulated. Wolfe's body was taken to England, where it  was received with all the honours due to his great achievement. General  Murray was left in command at Quebec, and was defeated in the following  spring by Levis in the battle of St. Foye, which raised the hopes of the  French until the appearance of English ships in the river relieved the  beleaguered garrison and decided for ever the fate of Quebec. A few  weeks later Montreal capitulated to Amherst, whose extreme caution  throughout the campaign was in remarkable contrast with the dash and  energy of the hero of Quebec. The war in Canada was now at an end, and  in 1763 the treaty of Paris closed the interesting chapter of French  dominion on the banks of the St. Lawrence and in the valleys of the Ohio  and the Mississippi.      SECTION 5.--Political, economic and social conditions of Canada during  French ride.    France and England entered on the struggle for dominion in America about  the same time, but long before the conquest of Canada the communities  founded by the latter had exhibited a vigour and vitality which were  never shown in the development of the relatively poor and struggling  colonies of Canada and Louisiana. The total population of New France in  1759--that is, of all the French possessions in North America--did not  exceed 70,000 souls, of whom 60,000 were inhabitants of the country of  the St. Lawrence, chiefly of the Montreal and Quebec districts. France  had a few struggling villages and posts in the very \"garden of the  North-west,\" as the Illinois country has been aptly called; but the  total population of New France from the great lakes to the Gulf of  Mexico did not exceed 10,000 souls, the greater number of whom dwelt on  the lower banks of the Mississippi. At this time the British colonies in  America, pent up between the Atlantic Ocean and the Appalachian  mountains, had a population twenty times larger than that of Canada and  Louisiana combined, and there was not any comparison whatever between  these French and British colonies with respect to trade, wealth or any  of the essentials of prosperity.    Under the system of government established by Louis XIV, under the  advice of Colbert, the governor and intendant of Canada were, to all  intents and purposes in point of authority, the same officials who  presided over the affairs of a province of France. In Canada, as in  France, governors-general had only such powers as were expressly given  them by the king, who, jealous of all authority in others, kept them  rigidly in check. In those days the king was supreme; \"I am the state,\"  said Louis Quatorze in the arrogance of his power; and it is thus easy  to understand that there could be no such free government or  representative institutions in Canada as were enjoyed from the very  commencement of their history by the old English colonies.    The governor had command of the militia and troops, and was nominally  superior in authority to the intendant, but in the course of time the  latter became virtually the most influential officer in the colony and  even presided at the council-board. This official, who had the right to  report directly to the king on colonial affairs, had large civil,  commercial and maritime jurisdiction, and could issue ordinances which  had full legal effect in the country. Associated with the governor and  intendant was a council comprising in the first instance five, and  eventually twelve, persons, chosen from the leading people of the  colony. The change of name, from the \"Supreme Council\" to the \"Superior  Council,\" is of itself some evidence of the determination of the king to  restrain the pretensions of all official bodies throughout the kingdom  and its dependencies. This body exercised legislative and judicial  powers. The bishop was one of its most important members, and the  history of the colony is full of the quarrels that arose between him and  the governor on points of official etiquette or with respect to more  important matters affecting the government of the country.    Protestantism was unknown in Canada under French rule, and the  enterprise of the Huguenots was consequently lost to a country always  suffering from a want of population. Even the merchants of La Rochelle,  who traded with the country, found themselves invariably subject to  restrictions which placed them at an enormous disadvantage in their  competition with their Roman Catholic rivals. The Roman Catholic Church  was all powerful at the council-board as well as in the parish. In the  past as in the present century, a large Roman Catholic church rose, the  most prominent building in every town and village, illustrating its  dominating influence in the homes of every community of the province.  The parishes were established at an early date for ecclesiastical  purposes, and their extent was defined wherever necessary by the  council at Quebec. They were practically territorial divisions for the  administration of local affairs, and were conterminous, whenever  practicable, with the seigniory. The cure, the seignior, the militia  captain (often identical with the seignior), were the important  functionaries in every parish. Even at the present time, when a  canonical parish has been once formed by the proper ecclesiastical  authority, it may be erected into a municipal or civil division after  certain legal formalities by the government of the province. Tithes were  first imposed by Bishop Laval, who practically established the basis of  ecclesiastical authority in the province. It was only in church matters  that the people had the right to meet and express their opinions, and  even then the intendant alone could give the power of assembling for  such purposes.    The civil law of French Canada relating to \"property,\" inheritance,  marriage, and the personal or civil rights of the community generally,  had its origin, like all similar systems, in the Roman law, on which  were engrafted, in the course of centuries, those customs and usages  which were adapted to the social conditions of France. The customary law  of Paris became the fundamental law of French Canada, and despite the  changes that it has necessarily undergone in the course of many years,  its principles can still be traced throughout the present system as it  has been modified under the influences of the British regime. The  superior council of Canada gave judgment in civil and criminal cases  according to the _coutume de Paris_, and below it there were inferior  courts for the judicial districts of Quebec, Three Rivers and Montreal.  The bishop had also special jurisdiction over ecclesiastical matters.  The intendant had authority to deal with cases involving royal, or  seigniorial, rights, and to call before him any case whatever for final  review and judgment. In all cases appeals were allowable to the king  himself, but the difficulty of communication with Europe in those days  practically confined such references to a few special causes. The  seigniors had also certain judicial or magisterial powers, but they  never acted except in very trivial cases. Torture was sometimes applied  to condemned felons as in France and other parts of the old world. On  the whole justice appears to have been honestly and fairly administered.    Parkman, in a terse sentence, sums up the conditions which fettered all  Canadian trade and industry, \"A system of authority, monopoly and  exclusion in which the government, and not the individual, acted always  the foremost part.\" Whether it was a question of ship-building, of a  brewery or a tannery, of iron works or a new fishery, appeals must be  made in the first instance to the king for aid; and the people were  never taught to depend exclusively on their individual or associated  enterprise. At the time of the conquest, and in fact for many years  previously, the principal products of the country were beaver skins,  timber, agricultural products, fish, fish oil, ginseng (for some years  only), beer, cider, rug carpets, homespun cloths--made chiefly by the  inmates of the religious houses--soap, potash, leather, stoves, tools  and other iron manufactures--made in the St. Maurice forges--never a  profitable industry, whether carried on by companies or the government  itself. All these industries were fostered by the state, but, despite  all the encouragement they received, the total value of the exports,  principally furs, seal and other oils, lumber, peas, grain and ginseng  never exceeded 3,500,000 francs, or about one-tenth of the export trade  of the English colonies to Great Britain. Two-thirds of this amount  represented beaver skins, the profits on which were very fluctuating, on  account of the unwise regulations by which, the trade was constantly  crippled. This business was heavily taxed to meet the necessities of  colonial government, which were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12667"],[0,"Travels of Richard and John Lander into the interior of Africa, for the (#7)"],[1,"to discover  a source, from which manual labour could be obtained, adapted to the  climate, and this resource was soon found in the black population of  Africa. It is not to be doubted, that many of our African settlements  were formed for the purpose of procuring a supply of slaves, for the  West India possessions, at the same time, the attention of others was  excited by a far more innocent and brilliant prospect. It was in the  beginning of the seventeenth century, that an unbounded spirit of  enterprise appears to have been excited amongst the British  merchants, by vague reports of an Africa _El Dorado_. The most  flattering reports had reached Europe, of the magnitude of the gold  trade carried on at Timbuctoo, and along the course of the Niger;  despatches were even received from Morocco, representing its  treasures, as surpassing those of Mexico and Peru, and in 1618, a  company was formed in London, for the express purpose of penetrating  to the country of gold, and to Timbuctoo. Exaggeration stepped in to  inflame the minds of the speculators, with the enormous wealth which  awaited them in the interior of Africa. The roofs of the houses were  represented to be covered with plates of gold, that the bottoms of  the rivers glistened with the precious metal, and the mountains had  only to be excavated, to yield a profusion of the metallic treasure.  From the northern part of Africa, impediments of almost an  insuperable nature presented themselves, to the attainment of these  great advantages; immense deserts, as yet unexplored by human foot,  and the knowledge of the existence of tribes of barbarous people on  the borders of them, were in themselves sufficient to daunt the  spirit of adventure in those quarters, and ultimately drew the  attention to the discovery of another channel, by which the golden  treasures of Timbuctoo could be reached, without encountering the  appalling dangers of the deserts, or the murderous intentions of the  natives.    The existence of the great river Niger, had been established by the  concurrent testimony of all navigators, but of its course or origin,  not the slightest information had been received. The circumstance of  its waters flowing from the eastward, gave rise to the conjecture,  that they flowed through the interior of the continent, and emptied  themselves either by the Senegal or the Gambia, into the Atlantic. It  was, therefore, considered probable, that by ascending the Senegal or  the Gambia, which were supposed to be merely tributary streams of the  Niger, of which they formed the estuary, that Timbuctoo and the  country of gold might be reached; and so strongly was this opinion  impressed upon the minds of the merchants, and other adventurers,  that a journey to Timbuctoo became the leading project of the day,  and measures were accordingly taken to carry it into execution.    The first person sent out by the company established for exploring  the Gambia, was Richard Thompson, a Barbary merchant, a man of some  talent and enterprise, who sailed from the Thames in the Catherine,  of 120 tons, with a cargo valued at nearly two thousand pounds  sterling. The expedition of Thompson was unfortunate in the extreme,  but the accounts received of his adventures and death, have been  differently recited. It is certain, that Thompson ascended the Gambia  as far as Tenda, a point much beyond what any European had before  reached, and according to one account, he was here attacked by the  Portuguese, who succeeded in making a general massacre of the  English. Another account states, that he was killed in an affray with  his own people, and thence has been styled the first martyr, or more  properly the first victim in the cause of African discovery.    The company, however, nothing daunted by the ill success of Thompson,  despatched another expedition on a larger scale, consisting of the  Sion of 200 tons, and the St. John of 50, giving the command to  Richard Jobson, to whom we are indebted for the first satisfactory  account of the great river districts of western Africa.    Jobson arrived in the Gambia, in November, 1620, and left his ship at  Cassau, a town situate on the banks of that river. Here, however, his  progress was impeded by the machinations of the Portuguese, and so  great was the dread of the few persons belonging to that nation, who  remained at Cassan after the massacre of Thompson, that scarcely one  could be found, who would take upon himself the office of a pilot to  conduct his vessel higher up the river. In this extremity he had no  other resource than to take to his boats, but, on ascending the  river, he found his merchandise in comparatively little request, and  repented that he had not laden his boats with salt. He soon  afterwards met with Brewer, who had accompanied Thompson to Tenda,  and remained with the English factory established up the river. He  also filled Jobson with \"golden hopes.\" Wherever the English stopped,  the negro kings, with their wives and daughters, came down to the  river side to buy, or rather to beg for trinkets, and still more for  brandy. They also showed themselves by no means ignorant of the art  of stealing, but their thefts were, in some degree, obliged to be  winked at, for fear of offending the royal personages, and drawing  down upon themselves the secret vengeance of the uncivilized hordes.  On Christmas day Tirambra, a negro prince, a great friend of the  English, sent them a load of elephant's flesh, which was accepted  with tokens of the greatest respect and gratitude, although the whole  gift was secretly thrown away.    After a navigation in boats of nearly thirty days, Jobson reached the  rapids of Barraconda, the highest point to where the tide flows, and  where he found himself involved in great difficulties. The ascent was  to be made against a current running with the greatest rapidity; the  great number of hidden rocks made it dangerous to pursue their course  during the night, the same time, that in attempting to avoid the  rocks, they struck upon sand banks and shallows, which often obliged  the crew to strip and go into the water, for the purpose of clearing  the boats from the sands. In the performance, however, of this task,  the greatest danger was run from the vast number of crocodiles, that  infested the river, and which, in several instances, seemed to be in  waiting for any prey with which the boats could supply them. The  river was also filled with \"a world of sea-horses, whose paths, as  they came on shore to feed, were beaten with tracts as large as a  London highway.\" The land on either side of the river was covered  with immense forests of unknown trees, which appeared to team with  living things, feathered and quadruped, making a roar sometimes,  which was sufficient to instil terror into the stoutest heart.  Amongst the latter, the baboons appeared to hold the sovereignty of  the woods, and whenever the navigation of the river obliged the  travellers to keep close in shore, where the banks were covered with  trees; the baboons posted themselves on the branches, and kept up a  regular attack upon the navigators, throwing at them the largest  branches, which they could break from the trees, and apparently  holding a palaver with each other, as to the best mode of prosecuting  the attack against the lawless intruders into their territory. They  appeared actually to be aware when a branch hit one of the  navigators, for they immediately up a shout of triumph, screaming  hideously, and \"grinning ghastly a horrible smile,\" as if expressive  of their victory. The voices of the crocodiles calling, as it were,  to each other, resembling the sound \"of a deep well,\" might be heard  at the distance of a league, whilst the elephants were seen in huge  hordes, raising their trunks in the air, and snorting defiance to all  who dared approach them. The latter are objects of great fear to the  natives, scarcely one of whom dare approach them, but they appeared  to have an instinctive sense of the superiority of the English, for  they no sooner made a movement against them, than they hurried away  with the speed of the forest deer, and were soon lost in the depths  of their native forests. Three balls were lodged in one of the  animals, but he made off with them; he was, however, soon after found  dead by the negroes. The most formidable animals, however, were the  lions, ounces, and leopards, which were seen at some distance, but  the sailors could not obtain a shot at them. At one of their halting  places, the baboons appeared like an army consisting of several  thousands, some of the tallest placed in front, marshalled under the  guidance of a leader, the smaller ones being in the middle, and the  rear brought up by the larger ones. The sailors showed some  disposition to enter into an acquaintance with the leader of the  army, but the desire was by no means mutual, for nature has very  kindly infused into the hearts of these creatures a strong distrust  in the friendly advances of their brother bipeds, knowing them to be,  in many of their actions, false, hollow, and deceitful, a proof of  which, one of the leaders of the army received in a very striking and  forcible manner, in the shape of a bullet, which passed directly  through his body. The baboons were, however, determined that their  treacherous friends should not obtain possession of the body of their  murdered leader, for before the sailors could arrive at the spot  where the deceased general lay, his indignant and patriotic  companions had carried his body away. On following these creatures to  their haunts in the recessess of the forest, places were found, where  the branches had been so intertwined, and the ground beaten so  smoothly, as to make it rather difficult to believe that the labour  had not been accomplished by human hands.    On the 26th of January, Jobson arrived at Tenda, and he immediately  despatched a"]]]
