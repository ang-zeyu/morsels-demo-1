Switzerland's  history has for centuries shown the conflict of two political policies,  one a policy of cantonal and communal independence, which has sprung  from the division of that mountainous country into segregated districts,  and the other one of political centralization, dictated by the necessity  for cooeperation to meet the dangers of Switzerland's central location  mid a circle of larger and stronger neighbors. Local geographic  conditions within the Swiss territory fixed the national ideal as a  league of \"sovereign cantons,\" to use the term of their constitution,  enjoying a maximum of individual rights and privileges, and tolerating a  minimum of interference from the central authority. Here was physical  dismemberment coupled with mutual political repulsion. But a location at  the meeting place of French, German, Austrian and Italian frontiers laid  upon them the distasteful necessity of union within to withstand  aggressions crowding upon them from without. Hence the growth of the  Swiss constitution since 1798 has meant a fight of the Confederation  against the canton in behalf of general rights, expanding the functions  of the central government, contracting those of canton and commune.[16]    [Sidenote: Local and remote geographic factors.]    Every country forms an independent whole, and as such finds its national  history influenced by its local climate, soil, relief, its location  whether inland or maritime, its river highways, and its boundaries of  mountain, sea, or desert. But it is also a link in a great chain of  lands, and therefore may feel a shock or vibration imparted at the  remotest end. The gradual desiccation of western Asia which took a fresh  start about 2,000 years ago caused that great exodus and displacement of  peoples known as the _Voelkerwanderung_, and thus contributed to the  downfall of Rome; it was one factor in the Saxon conquest of Britain and  the final peopling of central Europe. The impact of the Turkish hordes  hurling themselves against the defenses of Constantinople in 1453 was  felt only forty years afterward by the far-off shores of savage America.  Earlier still it reached England as the revival of learning, and it gave  Portugal a shock which started its navigators towards the Cape of Good  Hope in their search for a sea route to India. The history of South  Africa is intimately connected with the Isthmus of Suez. It owes its  Portuguese, Dutch, and English populations to that barrier on the  Mediterranean pathway to the Orient; its importance as a way station on  the outside route to India fluctuates with every crisis in the history  of Suez.    [Sidenote: Direct and indirect effects of environment.]    The geographic factors in history appear now as conspicuous direct  effects of environment, such as the forest warfare of the American  Indian or the irrigation works of the Pueblo tribes, now as a group of  indirect effects, operating through the economic, social and political  activities of a people. These remoter secondary results are often of  supreme importance; they are the ones which give the final stamp to the  national temperament and character, and yet in them the causal  connection between environment and development is far from obvious. They  have, therefore, presented pitfalls to the precipitate theorizer. He has  either interpreted them as the direct effect of some geographic cause  from which they were wholly divorced and thus arrived at conclusions  which further investigation failed to sustain; or seeing no direct and  obvious connection, he has denied the possibility of a generalization.    Montesquieu ascribes the immutability of religion, manners, custom and  laws in India and other Oriental countries to their warm climate.[17]  Buckle attributes a highly wrought imagination and gross superstition to  all people, like those of India, living in the presence of great  mountains and vast plains, knowing Nature only in its overpowering  aspects, which excite the fancy and paralyze reason. He finds, on the  other hand, an early predominance of reason in the inhabitants of a  country like ancient Greece, where natural features are on a small  scale, more comprehensible, nearer the measure of man himself.[18] The  scientific geographer, grown suspicious of the omnipotence of climate  and cautious of predicating immediate psychological effects which are  easy to assert but difficult to prove, approaches the problem more  indirectly and reaches a different solution. He finds that geographic  conditions have condemned India to isolation. On the land side, a great  sweep of high mountains has restricted intercourse with the interior; on  the sea side, the deltaic swamps of the Indus and Ganges Rivers and an  unbroken shoreline, backed by mountains on the west of the peninsula and  by coastal marshes and lagoons on the east, have combined to reduce its  accessibility from the ocean. The effect of such isolation is ignorance,  superstition, and the early crystallization of thought and custom.  Ignorance involves the lack of material for comparison, hence a  restriction of the higher reasoning processes, and an unscientific  attitude of mind which gives imagination free play. In contrast, the  accessibility of Greece and its focal location in the ancient world made  it an intellectual clearing-house for the eastern Mediterranean. The  general information gathered there afforded material for wide  comparison. It fed the brilliant reason of the Athenian philosopher and  the trained imagination which produced the masterpieces of Greek art and  literature.    [Sidenote: Indirect mental effects.]    Heinrich von Treitschke, in his recent \"Politik,\" imitates the direct  inference of Buckle when he ascribes the absence of artistic and poetic  development in Switzerland and the Alpine lands to the overwhelming  aspect of nature there, its majestic sublimity which paralyzes the  mind.[19] He reinforces his position by the fact that, by contrast, the  lower mountains and hill country of Swabia, Franconia and Thuringia,  where nature is gentler, stimulating, appealing, and not overpowering,  have produced many poets and artists. The facts are incontestable. They  reappear in France in the geographical distribution of the awards made  by the Paris _Salon_ of 1896. Judged by these awards, the rough  highlands of Savoy, Alpine Provence, the massive eastern Pyrenees, and  the Auvergne Plateau, together with the barren peninsula of Brittany,  are singularly lacking in artistic instinct, while art nourishes in all  the river lowlands of France. Moreover, French men of letters, by the  distribution of their birthplaces, are essentially products of fluvial  valleys and plains, rarely of upland and mountain.[20]    This contrast has been ascribed to a fundamental ethnic distinction  between the Teutonic population of the lowlands and the Alpine or Celtic  stock which survives in the isolation of highland and peninsula, thus  making talent an attribute of race. But the Po Valley of northern Italy,  whose population contains a strong infusion of this supposedly  stultifying Alpine blood, and the neighboring lowlands and hill country  of Tuscany show an enormous preponderance of intellectual and artistic  power over the highlands of the peninsula.[21] Hence the same contrast  appears among different races under like geographic conditions.  Moreover, in France other social phenomena, such as suicide, divorce,  decreasing birth-rate, and radicalism in politics, show this same  startling parallelism of geographic distribution,[22] and these cannot  be attributed to the stimulating or depressing effect of natural scenery  upon the human mind.    Mountain regions discourage the budding of genius because they are areas  of isolation, confinement, remote from the great currents of men and  ideas that move along the river valleys. They are regions of much labor  and little leisure, of poverty to-day and anxiety for the morrow, of  toil-cramped hands and toil-dulled brains. In the fertile alluvial  plains are wealth, leisure, contact with many minds, large urban centers  where commodities and ideas are exchanged. The two contrasted  environments produce directly certain economic and social results,  which, in turn, become the causes of secondary intellectual and artistic  effects. The low mountains of central Germany which von Treitschke cites  as homes of poets and artists, owing to abundant and varied mineral  wealth, are the seats of active industries and dense populations,[23]  while their low reliefs present no serious obstacle to the numerous  highways across them. They, therefore, afford all conditions for  culture.    [Sidenote: Indirect effects in differentiation of colonial peoples.]    Let us take a different example. The rapid modification in physical and  mental constitution of the English transplanted to North America, South  Africa, Australia and New Zealand has been the result of several  geographic causes working through the economic and social media; but it  has been ascribed by Darwin and others to the effect of climate. The  prevailing energy and initiative of colonists have been explained by the  stimulating atmosphere of their new homes. Even Natal has not escaped  this soft impeachment. But the enterprise of colonials has cropped out,  under almost every condition of heat and cold, aridity and humidity, of  a habitat at sea-level and on high plateau. This blanket theory of  climate cannot, therefore, cover the case. Careful analysis supersedes  it by a whole group of geographic factors working directly and  indirectly. The first of these was the dividing ocean which, prior to  the introduction of cheap ocean transportation and bustling steerage  agents, made a basis of artificial selection. Then it was the man of  abundant energy who, cramped by the narrow environment of a Norwegian  farm or Irish bog, came over to America to take up a quarter-s"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15299"],[0,"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon (#7)"],[1,"that the garrison of the castle should  surrender without parley, and it was done. Drake was not finished with  them yet; he wished to know from the governor what terms he was  prepared to offer in order that the city should be saved from pillage.  A negro boy was sent with this dispatch, and raging with the disgrace  of surrendering to the British Admiral, an officer ran a lance through  the boy's body. The poor boy was just able to get back, and died  immediately, close to where Drake was. The Spaniards had allowed their  vicious pride to incite them to commit murder and to insult the  British Admiral, who promptly avenged both deeds by having two friars  taken to the place where the boy had been stabbed, and there hanged.  \"El Draque\" sent a further note to the governor informing him that  unless the officer who murdered his messenger was executed at once by  the Spanish authorities he would hang two friars for every day that it  was put off. Needless to say, no more friars were hung, as the officer  paid the penalty of his crime without further delay. The lacerated  dignity of the Spaniards was still further tried by the demand for the  ransom of the city, and their procrastination cost them dear.    Drake's theology was at variance with that of the Founder of our  faith. His method was rigid self-assertion, and the power of the  strong. The affront he conceived to have been laid upon him and upon  the country he represented could only be wiped out by martial law.  Theoretic babbling about equality had no place in his ethics of the  universe. He proceeded to raid and burn both private dwellings,  palaces, and magazines; and the Government House, which was reputed to  be the finest building in the world, was operated upon for a month,  until it was reduced to dust. These are some of the penalties that  would have gladdened the heart of the gallant Beresford and his Albert  Hall comrades of our time had they been carried out against the  Germans, who have excelled the Spaniards of Philip's reign in cultured  murder and other brutalities in a war that has cost William II his  throne and brought the period of civilization perilously near its end.  It may be that the instability of petty statesmanship is to disappear,  and that Providence may have in unseen reserve a group of men with  mental and physical powers capable of subduing human virulence and  re-creating out of the chaos the Germans have made a new and enduring  civilization; and when they shall appear their advent will be  applauded by the stricken world.    Incidentally, it may be added that the German nation, which has  endangered the existence of civilization, would never have been  despised or thought ill of on account of its defeat by the Allies. It  is their unjustifiable method of beginning the war, and the dirty  brutal tricks by which they sought to win it, which have created  enduring mistrust and animosity against them. The law of human  fairness is no more exacting to small communities or individuals than  it is to nations.    Drake continued his relentless reprisals against San Domingo. The  burning of British sailors as heretics possessed his mind. The  distracted governor would have given his soul to get rid of him, but  Drake demanded money, and this the governor pleaded was not available,  but he was ultimately forced to provide 25,000 ducats, equalling  L50,000. This was accepted after the town had been shattered to pieces  and the shipping destroyed. The cathedral was the only important  building left intact, the probable reason being that the remains of  the great navigator, Columbus, were entombed there. Already the  mortality amongst Drake's crew had been alarmingly heavy, and he was  too wise a man to gamble with their lives until the bad season came  on, so he settled up and hurried away into the fresh sea breezes,  determined to give many more Spanish possessions a thorough shaking  up. The news that the freebooters were near at hand, and that they  were committing shocking deeds of theft and destruction on the way,  had filtered to the Carribean Sea, and struck the somnolent  population with terror. Carthagena, a magnificent city and the capital  of the Spanish Main, was Drake's next objective. He had large hopes of  doing well there. The health of most of his crew had improved and was  now robust, and their fighting spirits had been kindled to a high  pitch by their gallant chief, whose eye of genius was centred on a big  haul of material things. On arrival off the port, Carlile, whose  resource and courage were always in demand, was put in charge of a  strong force. He led the attack, mounted the parapets, drove the  Spanish garrison away in confusion, killed the commander, and  subsequently destroyed a large number of ships which were lazily lying  in the port. Many English prisoners were released, which was a godsend  in filling the places of those who had died.    The combative pretensions of the governor had received a severe shock.  He was beaten, and Drake, like a true sportsman, asked him and his  suite to dine with him, and with an air of Spanish dignity he  accepted. The occasion was memorable for the royal way the  distinguished guests were treated. The governor was studiously  cordial, and obviously wished to win the favour of his remorseless  visitors, so asked Drake and his officers to do him the honour of  accepting his hospitality in return, which they did. What form the  interchange of civilities took is not quite clear, but the governor's  apparent amiableness did not in any way move Drake to exercise  generosity. His object was ransom, and if this was agreed to  good-naturedly, all the better for the Spaniards, but he was neither  to be bought nor sold by wily tactics, nor won over by golden-tongued  rhetoric. The price of the rugged Devonshire sailor's alternative of  wild wrath and ruin was the modest sum of 100,000 ducats in hard cash.  Mutual convivialities and flowing courtesies were at an end; these  were one thing and reparation for the incarceration and burning of  unoffending British sailors as heretics was another.    \"Deeds of blood and torture can never be atoned for in money or  destruction of property. I am Drake, 'El Draque' if you like, and if  you don't comply with my terms, you shall be destroyed.\"    It was his habit openly to express himself in this way to Philip's  subjects, whether hostile or not, and we can imagine that similar  views were uttered in the Carthagena negotiations. The Spaniards  regarded his terms as monstrous impiety; they were aghast, pleaded  poverty, and protested and swore by the Holy Office that the total  amount they could find in the whole city was only 30,000 ducats.  Drake, with commendable prudence, seeing that he wished to get away  from the fever zone without delay, appears to have accepted this  amount, though authorities are at variance on this point. Some say  that he held out for his first claim and got it. I have not been able  to verify which is the correct amount, but in all probability he got  the 100,000 ducats. In any case, he piously charged them with  deception in their plea of poverty, but came to terms, declaring, no  doubt, that his own magnanimity astonished him.    But for the sudden outbreak of sickness amongst his crew, the  Carthagenians would not have fared nearly so well. The city might have  been, not only pillaged, but laid in ruins. As it was, he had emptied  a monastery and blown the harbour forts to pieces.    Drake's intention was to visit Panama, but the fever had laid heavy  hands on his men. Only a third of those who commenced the voyage with  him were well enough to do work at all, notwithstanding the  replenishment by released prisoners, so he was forced to abandon  further enterprises and shape his course homewards as quickly as  skilful navigation and the vagaries of wind and weather would allow.  Great deeds, even on this trip, stood to the credit of himself and  crew. The accomplishments were far below what was expected at the  outset in point of money value, but the priceless feature of the  voyage was the enhanced respect for Drake's name which had taken  possession of the Spanish race in every part of the world and  subsequently made the defeat of the Armada an easier task.    This eager soul, who was really the pioneer of a new civilization, had  still to face hard fate after the reluctant abandonment of his  intention to visit Panama. The sufferings of the adventurers from bad  weather and shortness of water was severely felt on the passage to  Florida. But the rough leader never lost heart or spared himself in  any way. He was obliged to heave-to at Cape Antonio (Cuba), and here  with indomitable courage went to work, putting heart into his men by  digging with pick and shovel in a way that would have put a navvy to  the blush, and when their efforts were rewarded he took his ships  through the Bahama Channel, and as he passed a fort which the  Spaniards had constructed and used as a base for a force which had  murdered many French Protestant colonists in the vicinity, Drake  landed, found out the murderous purpose of the fort, and blew it to  pieces. But that was not all. He also had the satisfaction of saving  the remainder of an unsuccessful English settlement founded by Sir  Walter Raleigh, and of taking possession of everything that he could  lay hands on from the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine. This was  the last episode of plunder connected with an expedition that was ripe  with thrilling incidents, and added to the fame of the most  enterprising figure of the Elizabethan reign.    In point of profit to those who had financed the voyage it was not a  success; but its political and ultimate commercial advantages were  enormous. These early seamen of the seventeenth century, many of them  amateurs, laid the foundation of the greatest navy and mercantile  marine of the world. It is to these"]]]
