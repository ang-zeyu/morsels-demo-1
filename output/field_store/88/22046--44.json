So he  departed with Kings Ban and Bors and twenty thousand men, and came to  Camelgard, and rescued Leodegrance, and slew ten thousand of Ryence's men  and put him to flight. Then Leodegrance made a great festival to the three  kings, and treated them with every manner of mirth and pleasure which  could be devised. And there had King Arthur the first sight of Guinevere,  daughter of Leodegrance, whom in the end he married, as shall be told  hereafter.    Then did Kings Ban and Bors take leave, and went to their own country,  where King Claudas worked great mischief. And King Arthur would have gone  with them, but they refused him, saying, \"Nay, ye shall not at this time,  for ye have yet much to do in these lands of your own; and we with the  riches we have won here by your gifts shall hire many good knights, and,  by the grace of God, withstand the malice of King Claudas; and if we have  need we will send to ye for succour; and likewise ye, if ye have need,  send for us, and we will not tarry, by the faith of our bodies.\"    When the two kings had left, King Arthur rode to Caerleon, and thither  came to him his half-sister Belisent, wife to King Lot, sent as a  messenger, but in truth to espy his power; and with her came a noble  retinue, and also her four sons--Gawain, Gaheris, Agravaine, and Gareth.  But when she saw King Arthur and his nobleness, and all the splendour of  his knights and service, she forbore to spy upon him as a foe, and told  him of her husband's plots against him and his throne. And the king, not  knowing that she was his half-sister, made great court to her; and being  full of admiration for her beauty, loved her out of measure, and kept her  a long season at Caerleon. Wherefore her husband, King Lot, was more than  ever King Arthur's enemy, and hated him till death with a passing great  hatred.    At that time King Arthur had a marvellous dream, which gave him great  disquietness of heart. He dreamed that the whole land was full of many  fiery griffins and serpents, which burnt and slew the people everywhere;  and then that he himself fought with them, and that they did him mighty  injuries, and wounded him nigh to death, but that at last he overcame and  slew them all. When he woke, he sat in great heaviness of spirit and  pensiveness, thinking what this dream might signify, but by-and-by, when  he could by no means satisfy himself what it might mean, to rid himself of  all his thoughts of it, he made ready with a great company to ride out  hunting.    As soon as he was in the forest, the king saw a great hart before him, and  spurred his horse, and rode long eagerly after it, and chased until his  horse lost breath and fell down dead from under him. Then, seeing the hart  escaped and his horse dead, he sat down by a fountain, and fell into deep  thought again. And as he sat there alone, he thought he heard the noise of  hounds, as it were some thirty couple in number, and looking up he saw  coming towards him the strangest beast that ever he had seen or heard tell  of, which ran towards the fountain and drank of the water. Its head was  like a serpent's, with a leopard's body and a lion's tail, and it was  footed like a stag; and the noise was in its belly, as it were the baying  or questing of thirty couple of hounds. While it drank there was no noise  within it; but presently, having finished, it departed with a greater  sound than ever.    The king was amazed at all this; but being greatly wearied, he fell  asleep, and was before long waked up by a knight on foot, who said,  \"Knight, full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou sawest a strange  beast pass this way?\"    \"Such a one I saw,\" said King Arthur to the knight, \"but that is now two  miles distant at the least. What would you with that beast?\"    \"Sir,\" said the knight, \"I have followed it for a long time, and have  killed my horse, and would to heaven I had another to pursue my quest  withal.\"    At that moment came a yeoman with another horse for the king, which, when  the knight saw, he earnestly prayed to be given him. \"For I have followed  this quest,\" said he, \"twelve months, and either I shall achieve him or  bleed of the best blood of my body.\"    It was King Pellinore who at that time followed the questing beast, but  neither he nor King Arthur knew each other.    \"Sir Knight,\" said King Arthur, \"leave that quest and suffer me to have  it, and I will follow it other twelve months.\"    \"Ah, fool,\" said the knight, \"thy desire is utterly in vain, for it shall  never be achieved but by me, or by my next of kin.\"    Therewith he started to the king's horse, and mounted to the saddle,  crying out, \"Grammercy, this horse is mine!\"    \"Well,\" said the king, \"thou mayest take my horse by force, and I will not  say nay; but till we prove whether thou or I be best on horseback, I shall  not rest content.\"    \"Seek me here,\" said the knight, \"whenever thou wilt, and here by this  fountain thou shalt find me;\" and so he passed forth on his way.    Then sat King Arthur in a deep fit of study, and bade his yeomen fetch him  yet another horse as quickly as they could. And when they left him all  alone came Merlin, disguised as a child of fourteen years of age, and  saluted the king, and asked him why he was so pensive and heavy.    \"I may well be pensive and heavy,\" he replied, \"for here even now I have  seen the strangest sight I ever saw.\"    \"That know I well,\" said Merlin, \"as well as thyself, and also all thy  thoughts; but thou art foolish to take thought, for it will not amend  thee. Also I know what thou art, and know thy father and thy mother.\"    \"That is false,\" said King Arthur; \"how shouldst thou know? thy years are  not enough.\"    \"Yea,\" said Merlin, \"but I know better than thou how thou wast born, and  better than any man living.\"    \"I will not believe thee,\" said King Arthur, and was wroth with the child.    So Merlin departed, and came again in the likeness of an old man of  fourscore years of age; and the king was glad at his coming, for he seemed  wise and venerable. Then said the old man, \"Why art thou so sad?\"    \"For divers reasons,\" said King Arthur; \"for I have seen strange things  to-day, and but this moment there was here a child who told me things  beyond his years to know.\"    \"Yea,\" said the old man, \"but he told thee truth, and more he would have  told thee hadst thou suffered him. But I will tell thee wherefore thou art  sad, for thou hast done a thing of late for which God is displeased with  thee, and what it is thou knowest in thy heart, though no man else may  know.\"    \"What art thou,\" said King Arthur, starting up all pale, \"that tellest me  these tidings?\"    \"I am Merlin,\" said he, \"and I was he in the child's likeness, also.\"    \"Ah,\" said King Arthur, \"thou art a marvellous and right fearful man, and  I would ask and tell thee many things this day.\"    As they talked came one with the king's horses, and so, King Arthur  mounting one, and Merlin another, they rode together to Caerleon; and  Merlin prophesied to Arthur of his death, and also foretold his own end.    And now King Arthur, having utterly dispersed and overwhelmed those kings  who had so long delayed his coronation, turned all his mind to overthrow  the Saxon heathens who yet in many places spoiled the land. Calling  together, therefore, his knights and men-at-arms, he rode with all his  hosts to York, where Colgrin, the Saxon, lay with a great army; and there  he fought a mighty battle, long and bloody, and drove him into the city,  and besieged him. Then Baldulph, Colgrin's brother, came secretly with six  thousand men to assail King Arthur and to raise the siege. But King Arthur  was aware of him, and sent six hundred horsemen and three thousand foot to  meet and fall on him instead. This therefore they did, encountering them  at midnight, and utterly defeated them, till they fled away for life. But  Baldulph, full of grief, resolved to share his brother's peril; wherefore  he shaved his head and beard, and disguised himself as a jester, and so  passed through King Arthur's camp, singing and playing on a harp, till by  degrees he drew near to the city walls, where presently he made himself  known, and was drawn up by ropes into the town.    Anon, while Arthur closely watched the city, came news that full six  hundred ships had landed countless swarms of Saxons, under Cheldric, on  the eastern coast. At that he raised the siege, and marched straight to  London, and there increased his army, and took counsel with his barons how  to drive the Saxons from the land for evermore.    Then with his nephew, Hoel, King of the Armorican Britons, who came with a  great force to help him, King Arthur, with a mighty multitude of barons,  knights, and fighting men, went swiftly up to Lincoln, which the Saxons  lay besieging. And there he fought a passing fierce battle, and made  grievous slaughter, killing above six thousand men, till the main body of  them turned and fled. But he pursued them hotly into the wood of Celidon,  where, sheltering themselves among the trees from his arrows, they made a  stand, and for a long season bravely defended themselves. Anon, he ordered  all the trees in that part of the forest to be cut down, leaving no  shelter or ambush; and with their trunks and branches made a mighty  barricade, which shut them in and hindered their escape. After three days,  brought nigh to death by famine, they offered to give up their wealth of  gold and silver spoils, and to depart forthwith in their empty ships;  moreover, to pay tribute to King Arthur when they reached their home, and  to leave him hostages till all was paid.    This offer, therefore, he accepted, and suffered them to depart. But when  they had been a few hours at sea, they repented of their shameful flight,  and turned their ships back again,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12758"],[0,"Library of the World's Best Mystery and Detective Stories (#7)"],[1,", came one morning to throw herself into the arms of the  elder, and said: \"Big Sister, I do not want thee to be unhappy. I do  not want thee to cry all thy life. I will never leave thee, never,  never! I--I, too, shall never marry. I shall stay with thee always,  always, always!\"    Suzanne, touched by the devotion of the child, kissed her, but did not  believe.    Yet the little one, also, kept her word, and despite the entreaties of  her parents, despite the supplications of the elder, she never married.  She was pretty, very pretty; she refused many a young man who seemed to  love her truly; and she never left her sister more.           *       *       *       *       *    They lived together all the days of their life, without ever being  separated a single time. They went side by side, inseparably united.  But Marguerite seemed always sad, oppressed, more melancholy than the  elder, as though perhaps her sublime sacrifice had broken her spirit.  She aged more quickly, had white hair from the age of thirty, and often  suffering, seemed afflicted by some secret, gnawing trouble.    Now she was to be the first to die.    Since yesterday she was no longer able to speak. She had only said, at  the first glimmers of day-dawn:    \"Go fetch Monsieur le Cure, the moment has come.\"    And she had remained since then upon her back, shaken with spasms, her  lips agitated as though dreadful words were mounting from her heart  without power of issue, her look mad with fear, terrible to see.    Her sister, torn by sorrow, wept wildly, her forehead resting on the  edge of the bed, and kept repeating:    \"Margot, my poor Margot, my little one!\"    She had always called her, \"Little One,\" just as the younger had always  called her \"Big Sister.\"    Steps were heard on the stairs. The door opened. A choir boy appeared,  followed by an old priest in a surplice. As soon as she perceived him,  the dying woman, with one shudder, sat up, opened her lips, stammered  two or three words, and began to scratch the sheets with her nails as  if she had wished to make a hole.    The Abbe Simon approached, took her hand, kissed her brow, and with a  soft voice:    \"God pardon thee, my child; have courage, the moment is now come,  speak.\"    Then Marguerite, shivering from head to foot, shaking her whole couch  with nervous movements, stammered:    \"Sit down, Big Sister ... listen.\"    The priest bent down toward Suzanne, who was still flung upon the bed's  foot. He raised her, placed her in an armchair, and taking a hand of  each of the sisters in one of his own, he pronounced:    \"Lord, my God! Endue them with strength, cast Thy mercy upon them.\"    And Marguerite began to speak. The words issued from her throat one by  one, raucous, with sharp pauses, as though very feeble.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Pardon, pardon, Big Sister; oh, forgive! If thou knewest how I have  had fear of this moment all my life....\"    Suzanne stammered through her tears:    \"Forgive thee what, Little One? Thou hast given all to me, sacrificed  everything; thou art an angel....\"    But Marguerite interrupted her:    \"Hush, hush! Let me speak ... do not stop me. It is dreadful ... let  me tell all ... to the very end, without flinching. Listen. Thou  rememberest ... thou rememberest ... Henry....\"    Suzanne trembled and looked at her sister. The younger continued:    \"Thou must hear all, to understand. I was twelve years old, only twelve  years old; thou rememberest well, is it not so? And I was spoiled, I  did everything that I liked! Thou rememberest, surely, how they spoiled  me? Listen. The first time that he came he had varnished boots. He got  down from his horse at the great steps, and he begged pardon for his  costume, but he came to bring some news to papa. Thou rememberest, is  it not so? Don't speak--listen. When I saw him I was completely carried  away, I found him so very beautiful; and I remained standing in a  corner of the _salon_ all the time that he was talking. Children are  strange ... and terrible. Oh yes ... I have dreamed of all that.    \"He came back again ... several times ... I looked at him with all my  eyes, with all my soul ... I was large of my age ... and very much more  knowing than anyone thought. He came back often ... I thought only of  him. I said, very low:    \"'Henry ... Henry de Lampierre!'    \"Then they said that he was going to marry thee. It was a sorrow; oh,  Big Sister, a sorrow ... a sorrow! I cried for three nights without  sleeping. He came back every day, in the afternoon, after his lunch ...  thou rememberest, is it not so? Say nothing ... listen. Thou madest him  cakes which he liked ... with meal, with butter and milk. Oh, I know  well how. I could make them yet if it were needed. He ate them at one  mouthful, and ... and then he drank a glass of wine, and then he said,  'It is delicious.' Thou rememberest how he would say that?    \"I was jealous, jealous! The moment of thy marriage approached. There  were only two weeks more. I became crazy. I said to myself: 'He shall  not marry Suzanne, no, I will not have it! It is I whom he will marry  when I am grown up. I shall never find anyone whom I love so much.' But  one night, ten days before the contract, thou tookest a walk with him  in front of the chateau by moonlight ... and there ... under the fir,  under the great fir ... he kissed thee ... kissed ... holding thee in  his two arms ... so long. Thou rememberest, is it not so? It was  probably the first time ... yes ... Thou wast so pale when thou earnest  back to the _salon_.    \"I had seen you two; I was there, in the shrubbery. I was angry! If I  could I should have killed you both!    \"I said to myself: 'He shall not marry Suzanne, never! He shall marry  no one. I should be too unhappy.' And all of a sudden I began to hate  him dreadfully.    \"Then, dost thou know what I did? Listen. I had seen the gardener  making little balls to kill strange dogs. He pounded up a bottle with a  stone and put the powdered glass in a little ball of meat.    \"I took a little medicine bottle that mamma had; I broke it small with  a hammer, and I hid the glass in my pocket. It was a shining powder ...  The next day, as soon as you had made the little cakes ... I split  them with a knife and I put in the glass ... He ate three of them ...  I too, I ate one ... I threw the other six into the pond. The two swans  died three days after ... Dost thou remember? Oh, say nothing ...  listen, listen. I, I alone did not die ... but I have always been  sick. Listen ... He died--thou knowest well ... listen ... that, that  is nothing. It is afterwards, later ... always ... the worst ... listen.    \"My life, all my life ... what torture! I said to myself: 'I will never  leave my sister. And at the hour of death I will tell her all ...'  There! And ever since, I have always thought of that moment when I  should tell thee all. Now it is come. It is terrible. Oh ... Big  Sister!    \"I have always thought, morning and evening, by night and by day, 'Some  time I must tell her that ...' I waited ... What agony! ... It is done.  Say nothing. Now I am afraid ... am afraid ... oh, I am afraid. If I am  going to see him again, soon, when I am dead. See him again ... think  of it! The first! Before thou! I shall not dare. I must ... I am going  to die ... I want you to forgive me. I want it ... I cannot go off to  meet him without that. Oh, tell her to forgive me, Monsieur le Cure,  tell her ... I implore you to do it. I cannot die without that....\"           *       *       *       *       *    She was silent, and remained panting, always scratching the sheet with  her withered nails.    Suzanne had hidden her face in her hands, and did not move. She was  thinking of him whom she might have loved so long! What a good life  they should have lived together! She saw him once again in that  vanished bygone time, in that old past which was put out forever. The  beloved dead--how they tear your hearts! Oh, that kiss, his only kiss!  She had hidden it in her soul. And after it nothing, nothing more her  whole life long!           *       *       *       *       *    All of a sudden the priest stood straight, and, with a strong vibrant  voice, he cried:    \"Mademoiselle Suzanne, your sister is dying!\"    Then Suzanne, opening her hands, showed her face soaked with tears, and  throwing herself upon her sister, she kissed her with all her might,  stammering:    \"I forgive thee, I forgive thee, Little One.\"        _The Horla, or Modern Ghosts_      _May 8th._ What a lovely day! I have spent all the morning lying in the  grass in front of my house, under the enormous plantain tree which  covers it, and shades and shelters the whole of it. I like this part of  the country and I am fond of living here because I am attached to it by  deep roots, profound and delicate roots which attach a man to the soil  on which his ancestors were born and died, which attach him to what  people think and what they eat, to the usages as well as to the food,  local expressions, the peculiar language of the peasants, to the smell  of the soil, of the villages and of the atmosphere itself.    I love my house in which I grew up. From my windows I can see the Seine  which flows by the side of my garden, on the other side of the road,  almost through my grounds, the great and wide Seine, which goes to  Rouen and Havre, and which is covered with boats passing to and fro.    On the left, down yonder, lies Rouen, that large town with its blue  roofs, under its pointed Gothic towers. They are innumerable, delicate  or broad, dominated by the spire of the cathedral, and full of bells  which sound through the blue air on fine mornings, sending their sweet  and distant iron clang to me; their metallic sound which the breeze  wafts in my direction, now stronger and now weaker, according as the  wind is stronger or lighter.    What a delicious morning it was!    About"]]]
