[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14992"],[0,"The Life of Froude (#7)"],[1,"lodge of Lord  Kenmare, where I have persuaded an old lady to take me into the  family. I am going to live with them, and I am going to have her  ladyship's own boudoir to scribble in. It is a wild place enough  with porridge and potatoes to eat, varied with what fish I may  provide for myself and arbutus berries if it comes to starving. The  noble lord has been away for some years. They will put a deal table  into the said boudoir for me, and if living under a noble roof has  charms for me I have that at least to console myself with. I can't  tell about your coming. There may be a rising in September, and you  may be tempted to turn rebel, you know; and I don't know whether you  like porridge, or whether a straw bed is to your--not 'taste,'  touch is better, I suppose. It is perfectly beautiful here, or it  would be if it wasn't for the swarm of people about one that are for  ever insisting on one's saying so. Between hotel-keeper and carmen  and boatmen and guides that describe to my honour the scenery, and  young girls that insist on my honour taking a taste of the goats'  milk, and a thousand other creatures that insist on boring me and  being paid for it, I am really thankful every night when I get to my  room and find all the pieces of me safe in their places. However, I  shall do very well when I get to my lodge, and in the meantime I am  contented to do ill. I have hopes of these young paddies after all.  I think they will have a fight for it, or else their landlords will  bully the Government into strong measures as they call them--and then  will finally disgust whatever there is left of doubtful loyalty in  the country into open unloyalty, and they will win without fighting.  There is the most genuine hatred of the Irish landlords everywhere  that I can remember to have heard expressed of persons or things. My  landlady that is to be next week told me she believed it was God's  doing. If God wished the people should be stirred up to fight, then  it was all right they should do it; and if He didn't will, why  surely then there would be no fighting at all. I am not sure it  could have been expressed better. I have heard horrid stories in  detail of the famine. They are getting historical now, and the  people can look back at them and tell them quietly. It is very lucky  for us that we are let to get off for the most part with  generalities, and the knowledge of details is left to those who  suffer them. I think if it was not so we should all go mad or shoot  ourselves.    \"The echoes of English politics which come over here are very  sickening: even The Spectator exasperates me with its d--d cold-  water cure for all enthusiasm. When I see these beautiful mountain  glens, I quite long to build myself a little den in the middle of  them, and say good-bye to the world, with all its lies and its  selfishness, till other times. I have still one great consolation  here, and that is the rage and fury of the sqireens at the poor  rates; six and sixpence in the pound with an estate mortgaged right  up to high-water mark and the year's income anticipated is not the  very most delightful prospect possible.    \"The crows are very fat and very plenty. They sit on the roadside  and look at you with a kind of right of property. There are no  beggars--at least, professional ones. They were all starved-dead,  gone where at least I suppose the means of subsistence will be found  for them. There is no begging or starving, I believe, in the two  divisions of Kingdom Come. I see in The Spectator the undergraduates  were energetically loyal at Commemoration--nice boys--and the dons  have been snubbed about Guizot. Is there a chance for M---? Poor  fellow, he is craving to be married, and ceteris paribus I suppose  humanity allows it to be a claim, though John Mill doesn't. My  wedding party have not arrived. It is impossible not to feel a  kindly interest in them. At the bottom of all the agitation a  wedding sets going in us all there is lying, I think a kind of  misgiving, a secret pity for the fate of the poor rose which is  picked now and must forthwith wither; and our boisterous  jollification is but an awkward barely successful effort at  concealing it. Well, good-bye. I hardly know when I look over  these pages whether to wish you to get them or not.    \"Yours notwithstanding,  \"J.A.F.\"    Ireland had been devastated, far more than decimated, by the famine,  and was simmering with insurrection, like the Continent of Europe.  The Corn Laws had gone, and the Whigs were back in office, but they  could do nothing with Ireland. To Froude it appeared as if the  disturbed state of the country were an emblem of distracted Churches  and outworn creeds. Religion seemed to him hopelessly damaged, and  he asked himself whether morality would not follow religion. If the  Christian sanction were lost, would the difference between right and  wrong survive? His own state of mind was thoroughly wretched. The  creed in which he had been brought up was giving way under him, and  he could find no principle of action at all. Brooding ceaselessly  over these problems, he at the same time lowered his physical  strength by abstinence, living upon bread, milk, and vegetables,  giving up meat and wine. In this unpromising frame of mind, and in  the course of solitary rambles, he composed The Nemesis of Faith.*  The book is, both in substance and in style, quite unworthy of  Froude. But in the life of a man who afterwards wrote what the world  would not willingly let die it is an epoch of critical importance.  To describe it in a word is impossible. To describe it in a few  words is not easy. Froude himself called it in after life a \"cry of  pain,\" meaning that it was intended to relieve the intolerable  pressure of his thoughts. It is not a novel, it is not a treatise,  it is not poetry, it is not romance. It is the delineation of a  mood; and though it was called, with some reason, sceptical, its  moral, if it has a moral, is that scepticism leads to misconduct.  That unpleasant and unverified hypothesis, soon rejected by Froude  himself, has been revived by M. Bourget in Le Disciple, and L'Etape.  The Nemesis of Faith is as unwholesome as either of these books, and  has not their literary charm. It had few friends, because it  disgusted free-thinking Liberals as much as it scandalised orthodox  Conservatives. If it were read at all nowadays, as it is not, it  would be read for the early sketches of Newman and Carlyle,  afterwards amplified in memorable pages which are not likely to  perish.    --  * Chapman, 1849.  --    In a letter to Charles Kingsley, written from Dartington on New  Year's Day, 1849, Froude speaks with transparent candour of his  book, and of his own mind:    \"I wish to give up my Fellowship. I hate the Articles. I have said I  hate chapel to the Rector himself; and then I must live somehow, and  England is not hospitable, and the parties here to whom I am in  submission believe too devoutly in the God of this world to forgive  an absolute apostasy. Under pain of lost favour for ever if I leave  my provision at Oxford, I must find another, and immediately. There  are many matters I wish to talk over with you. I have a book  advertised. You may have seen it. It is too utterly subjective to  please you. I can't help it. If the creatures breed, they must come  to the birth. There is something in the thing, I know; for I cut a  hole in my heart, and wrote with the blood. I wouldn't write such  another at the cost of the same pain for anything short of direct  promotion into heaven.\"    Of Kingsley himself Froude wrote* to another clerical friend, friend  of a lifetime, Cowley Powles: \"Kingsley is such a fine fellow--I  almost wish, though, he wouldn't write and talk Chartism, and be  always in such a stringent excitement about it all. He dreams of  nothing but barricades and provisional Governments and grand  Smithfield bonfires, where the landlords are all roasting in the fat  of their own prize oxen. He is so musical and beautiful in poetry,  and so rough and harsh in prose, and he doesn't know the least that  it is because in the first the art is carrying him out of himself,  and making him forget just for a little that the age is so entirely  out of joint.\" A very fine and discriminating piece of criticism.    --  * April 10th, 1849.  --    The immediate effect of The Nemesis, the only effect it ever had,  was disastrous. Whatever else it might be, it was undoubtedly  heretical, and in the Oxford of 1849 heresy was the unpardonable  sin. The Senior Tutor of Exeter, the Reverend William Sewell, burnt  the book during a lecture in the College Hall. Sewell, afterwards  founder and first Warden of Radley, was a didactic Churchman, always  talking or writing, seldom thinking, who contributed popular  articles to The Quarterly Review. The editor, Lockhart, knew their  value well enough. They tell one nothing, he said, they mean  nothing, they are nothing, but they go down like bottled velvet.  Sewell's eccentricities could not hurt Froude. But more serious  consequences followed. The Governing Body of Exeter, the Rector* and  Fellows, called upon him to resign his Fellowship. This they had no  moral right to do, and Froude should have rejected the demand. For  though his name and college were on the title-page of the book, the  book itself was a work of fiction, and he could not justly be held  responsible for the opinions of the characters. Expulsion was,  however, held out to him as the alternative of resignation.    --  * Dr. Richards.  --    \"If the Rector will permit me,\" he wrote from Oxford to Clough,  \"tomorrow I cease to be a Fellow of the College. But there is a  doubt if he will permit it, and will not rather try to send me out  in true heretic style. My book is therefore, as you may suppose,  out. I know little of what is said, but it sells fast, and is being  read, and is producing sorrow this time, I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14993"],[0,"Rig Veda Americanus (#7)"],[1,"Tezcatzoncatl._        1.

In the temple of Tezcatzoncatl he aids those who cry to him, he  gives them to drink; the god gives to drink to those who cry to him.      4. In the temple by the water-reeds the god aids those who call upon  him, he gives them to drink; the god aids those who cry unto him.      _Notes._    Tezcatzoncatl was one of the chief gods of the native inebriating  liquor, the pulque. Its effects were recognized as most disastrous, as  is seen from his other names, _Tequechmecaniani_, \"he who hangs people,\"  and _Teatlahuiani_, \"he who drowns people.\" Sahagun remarks, \"They  always regarded the pulque as a bad and dangerous article.\" The word  _Totochtin_, plural of _tochtli_, rabbit, was applied to drunkards, and  also to some of the deities of special forms of drunkenness.    The first verse is merely a series of lamentations. The second speaks of  the sad effects of the pulque in ancient times. (On Colhuacan see Notes  to Hymn XIII.)

The derivation from  _atlatl_, arrow, would seem more appropriate to the words of this hymn.  _Chalmecatl_, used as a synonym in v. 1, appears to be from _chalania_,  to beat, to strike, as a drum.

Now I seek our food, proceeding to eat it and to drink of the  water, going to where the sand begins.      4. Now I go to my beautiful house, there to eat my food, and to drink  of the water, going to where the sand begins.      _Notes._    The god Yacatecutli, whose name means \"lord of travelers,\" or \"the lord  who guides,\" was the divinity of the merchants. Sahagun (_Historia_,  Lib. I, cap. 19) and Duran (_Historia_, cap. 90) furnish us many  particulars of his worship.    The hymn is extremely obscure, containing a number of archaic words, and  my rendering is very doubtful. The writer of the Gloss is, I think, also  at fault in his paraphrase. The general purpose of the hymn seems to be  that of a death-song, chanted probably by the victims about to be  sacrificed. They were given the sacred food to eat, as described by  Duran, and then prepared themselves to undergo death, hoping to go to  \"the beautiful house,\" which the Gloss explains as Tlalocan, the  Terrestrial Paradise.
