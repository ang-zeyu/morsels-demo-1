[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12590"],[0,"The Shadow of the Rope (#7)"],[1," guilty.\"    Not guilty! Not guilty! And to see it in print! Her eyes filled at the  sight, and she dried them to gloat again. There were columns and columns  about the case, embellished with not unskilful sketches of counsel  addressing the jury, and of the judge in the act of summing up. But  Rachel had listened to every word from all three; and the professional  report was less full and less accurate than the one which she carried in  her brain and would carry to her grave. Not that the speeches mattered  now. It was no speech that had saved her; it was her own story, from her  own lips, that the lawyers would have closed! Rachel forgave them now;  she was almost grateful to them for having left it to her to save  herself in spite of them all: so should her perfect innocence be  impressed upon the whole country as on those twelve fair minds. And once  more she pored upon the hurriedly added and ill-printed line which gave  their verdict to the world, while the train stopped and started, only to  stop and start again.    \"And what do you think of it, madam?\"    The voice came from the opposite corner of the compartment, and Rachel  knew it for that of the gentleman who had jumped in at the last moment  at Blackfriars Bridge. It was Charing Cross that they were leaving now,  and the door had not opened at that station or the last. Rachel sat  breathless behind her evening paper. Not to answer might be to fasten  suspicion upon her widow's weeds; and, for all her right to look mankind  in the face, she shrank instinctively from immediate recognition. Then  in a clap came the temptation to discuss her own case with the owner of  a voice at once confident and courtly, and subtly reminiscent of her  native colony, where it is no affront for stranger to speak to stranger  without introduction or excuse.    Rachel's hesitation lasted perhaps a couple of seconds, and then her  paper lay across her lap.    \"Of what?\" she asked, with some presence of mind, for she had never an  instant's doubt that the question referred to the topic of the hour.    \"We were reading the same paper,\" replied the questioner, with perfect  courtesy; \"it only struck me that we might both be reading the same  thing, and feeling equally amazed at the verdict.\"    \"You mean in the Minchin case,\" said Rachel steadily, and without the  least interrogation in her tone. \"Yes, I was reading it, as I suppose  everybody is. But I disagree with you about the verdict.\"    The young widow's manner was as downright as her words. There was a  sudden raising of the bushy eyebrows in the opposite corner, a brief  opening of the black eyes underneath.    \"Pardon me,\" said the gentleman, breaking into a smile; \"I was not aware  that I had expressed an opinion on that point.\"    \"I understood you were amazed,\" said Rachel, dryly.    \"And are not you?\" cried the other point-blank. \"Do you mean to tell me  that you were prepared for an acquittal?\"    \"I was prepared for anything,\" replied Rachel, returning a peculiarly  penetrating stare with one at least as steady, and yet holding her  breath for very fear lest this stranger had found her out, until his  next words allayed the suspicion.    \"Madam, have you followed the case?\"    \"Indeed I have,\" sighed honest Rachel.    \"And as a woman you believe this woman innocent?\"    \"I do.\"    It was hard enough to say no more than that; but Rachel was very fresh  from her great lesson in self-control.    \"It is easy to see that you do not,\" she merely permitted herself to  add.    \"On the contrary,\" said he, with great precision; \"on the contrary, my  dear madam, I believe this poor lady to be as innocent as yourself.\"    Again their eyes were locked; again Rachel drew the only inference from  so pointed a pronouncement, and yet again was the impression shaken by  her companion's next words.    \"But I really have no right to an opinion,\" said he; \"since, unlike you,  I cannot claim to have read the case. Nor is that the interesting thing  now.\" The stations had come and gone, until now they were at Victoria.  The speaker looked out of the window, until they were off again, and off  by themselves as before. \"The interesting thing, to me, is not what this  poor lady has or has not done, but what on earth she is going to do  now!\"    He looked at her again, and now Rachel was sure. But there was a  kindness in his look that did away both with resentment and regret.    \"They say she has literally no friends in England,\" he went on, with  unconcealed concern. \"That is incredible; and yet, if there be any truth  in it, what a terrible position! I fear that everybody will not share  your conviction, and, I may add, my own. If one can judge thus early by  what one has heard and seen for oneself, this verdict is a personal  disappointment to the always bloodthirsty man in the street. Then, God  help the poor lady if he spots her! I only hope she will not give him a  chance.\"    And now Rachel not only knew that he knew, but that he wished to apprise  her of his knowledge without confessing it in so many words. So he would  spare her that embarrassment, and would help her if he could, this utter  stranger! Yet she saw it in his face, she heard it in his voice; and  becoming gradually alive to his will to help her, as she instinctively  was to his power, she had herself the will to consult one whose good  intention and better tact were alike obvious. Mystery there was in her  meeting with this man; something told her that it was no accident on his  side; she began to wonder whether she had not seen him before; and while  she wondered he came and sat opposite to her, and went on speaking in a  lower voice, his dark eyes fixed on hers.    \"If Mrs. Minchin wants a friend--and to-night I think she must--if ever  she did or will! Well, if she does, I for one would be her friend--if  she would trust me!\"    The last words were the lowest of all; and in the tone of them there was  a timbre which thrilled Rachel as the dark eyes fascinated her. She  began to feel a strange repugnance--and yet more strange attraction. But  to the latter her independence gave instant battle--a battle the easier  to fight since the next station was Rachel's destination.    \"Do you think she would trust me?\" he almost whispered leaning towards  her. \"As a woman--don't you think she might?\"    As Rachel hesitated the carriages began to groan beneath the brake; and  her hesitation was at an end. So also was her limited capacity for  pretence. She sat more upright in her corner, her shoulders fell in  angles, and beneath the veil, which she had raised to read her paper,  her eyes carried the war of interrogation into the enemy's country.    \"I seem to have seen you before,\" said Rachel, cool of tongue but hot at  heart.    \"I think it very possible that you have.\"    \"Were you at the trial?\"    \"From first to last!\"    The pause that followed was really broken by the lights of Sloane Square  station.    \"You know me,\" said Rachel, hurriedly; \"I have seen that for some time.  May I ask if you are Mr. Steel?\"    \"I am.\"    \"The Mr. Steel who sent me his card after the trial?\"    Steel bowed.    \"As a perfect stranger?\"    \"As a perfect stranger who had watched you for a whole long week in  court.\"    Rachel ignored the relative clause.    \"And because I would not see you, Mr. Steel, you have followed me, and  forced yourself upon me!\"    The train stopped, and Rachel rose.    \"You will gather my motives when you recall our conversation,\" observed  Steel; and he opened the door for her. But Rachel turned to him before  alighting.    \"Mr. Steel,\" said she, \"I am quite sure that you mean kindly and well,  and that I above all women should feel supremely grateful; but I cannot  help thinking that you are unjust to the man in the street!\"    \"Better give him a trial,\" said Steel, coldly enough in his turn.    \"I should prefer to,\" rejoined Rachel, getting out; and there was no  little sting in the intonation of the verb; but Mr. Steel was left  smiling and nodding very confidently to himself.          CHAPTER V    THE MAN IN THE STREET      Rachel's perturbation was only the greater from her success in  concealing, or at least suppressing it, during the actual process of  this singular interview. You may hold your breath without moving a  muscle, but the muscles will make up for it when their turn comes, and  it was so with Rachel and her nerves; they rose upon her even on the  platform, and she climbed the many stairs in a tremor from head to foot.  And at the top, in the open night, and at all the many corners of a  square that is nothing of the kind, from hoarse throat and on fluttering  placard, it was \"Trial and Verdict,\" or \"Sensational Verdict at the Old  Bailey,\" here as at the other end of the town.    But now all Rachel's thoughts were of this mysterious Mr. Steel; of his  inexplicable behavior towards her, and of her own attitude towards him.  Yet, when all was said, or when all that had been said could be  remembered, would his behavior be found so very inexplicable? Rachel was  not devoid of a proper vanity, albeit that night she had probably less  than most women with a tithe of her personal attractions; and yet upon  reflection she could conceive but one explanation of such conduct in an  elderly man.    \"There is no fool like an old fool,\" quoted Rachel to herself; and it  was remarkable that until this moment she had never thought of Mr. Steel  as either elderly or old. His eyes were young; his voice was young; she  could hear him and see him still, so the strong impression was not all  on one side. No more, it would seem, was the fascination. Rachel,  indeed, owned to no such feeling, even in her inmost heart. But she did  begin to blame herself, alike for her reception of advances which might  well have been dictated by mere eccentric benevolence, and for her  readiness now to put another construction upon them. And all this time  she was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12595"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

It is important to admit no more cold air into the house than  is just required for the fires, and for ventilation; hence there is  great error in the common practice of leaving all the chimneys that are  not in use, quite open; for each admits as much air as a hole in the  wall would do, or a pane deficient in a window. Perhaps the best mode of  admitting air to feed the fires is through tubes, leading directly from  the outer air to the fire-place, and provided with what are called  throttle-valves, for the regulation of the quantity; or the fresh air  admitted by tubes may be made first to spread in the room, having been  warmed during its passage inwards, by coming near the fire.--In a  perfectly close apartment, ventilation must be expressly provided for by  an opening near the ceiling, to allow the impure air rising from the  respiration of the company to pass away at once; but with an open fire,  the purpose is effected by the frequent change of the whole air of the  room which that construction occasions.    With a view to have the most perfect security against cold blasts and  fluctuation of temperature in rooms intended for invalids, and still to  retain the so much valued appearance of the open fire, a glazed frame or  window may be placed at the entrance of the chimney, so as completely to  prevent the passage of air from the room to the fire. The close room  will then be warmed by the fire through the glass, as a green-house is  warmed by the rays of the sun. It is true, that the heat of combustion  does not pass through glass so readily as the heat of the sun; but the  difference is not important. The glass of such a window must, of course,  be divided into small panes, and supported by a metallic frame work; and  there must be a flap or door in the frame work, for the purpose of  admitting the fuel and stirring the fire. Air must be supplied to the  fire as described above, by a tube leading directly from the external  atmosphere. The ventilation of the room may be effected by an opening  into the chimney near the ceiling; and the temperature may be regulated  with great precision by a valve placed in this opening, and made to obey  the dilatation and contraction of a piece of wire affixed to it, the  exact length of which at any time will depend on the temperature of the  room. The author first imagined such an arrangement of rooms for the  winter residence of a person who was threatened with consumption;  and the happy issue of the case, and of others treated on similar  principles, has led him to doubt, whether many of the patients with  incipient consumption, who are usually sent to warmer climates, and who  die there after hardships on the journey, and mental distress from the  banishment sufficient to shake even strong health, might not be saved,  by judicious treatment in properly warmed and ventilated apartments,  under their own roofs, and in the midst of affectionate kindred.    _Arnott's Elements of Physics._           *       *       *       *       *      LORD ORFORD'S DESCRIPTION OF THE DEATH OF GENERAL WOLFE.    The rapidity with which our arms had prevailed in every quarter of the  globe, made us presume that Canada could not fail of being added to our  acquisitions; and, however arduously won, it would have sunk in value if  the transient cloud that overcast the dawn of this glory had not made it  burst forth with redoubled lustre. The incidents of dramatic fiction  could not be conducted with more address to lead an audience from  despondency to sudden exultation, than accident prepared to excite  the passions of a whole people. They despaired--they triumphed--and  they wept--for Wolfe had fallen in the hour of victory! Joy, grief,  curiosity, astonishment were painted in every countenance; the more they  inquired, the higher their admiration rose. Not an incident but was  heroic and affecting! Wolfe between persuasion of the impracticability,  unwillingness to leave any attempt untried that could be proposed, and  weariness and anxiety of mind and body, had determined to make one last  effort above the town. He embarked his forces at one in the morning, and  passed the French sentinels in silence that were posted along the shore.  The current carried them beyond the destined spot. They found themselves  at the foot of a precipice, esteemed so impracticable, that only a  slight guard of one hundred and fifty men defended it. Had there been a  path, the night was too dark to discover it. The troops, whom nothing  could discourage, for these difficulties could not, pulled themselves  and one another up by stumps and boughs of trees. The guard hearing a  rustling, fired down the precipice at random, as our men did up into  the air; but, terrified by the strangeness of the attempt, the French  picquet fled--all but the captain, who, though wounded, would not accept  quarter, but fired at one of our officers at the head of five hundred  men. This, as he staked but a single life, was thought such an unfair  war, that, instead of honouring his desperate valour, our men, to  punish him, cut off his croix de St. Louis before they sent him to  the hospital. Two of our officers, however, signed a certificate  of his courage, lest the French should punish him as corrupted--our  enterprises, unless facilitated by corruption, being deemed impossible  to have taken place. Day-break discovered our forces in possession of  the eminence. Montcalm could not credit it when reported to him--but it  was too late to doubt, when nothing but a battle could save the town.  Even then he held our attempt so desperate, that being shown the  position of the English, he said, \"Oui, je les vois ou ils ne doivent  pas etre.\" Forced to quit his intrenchments, he said, \"S'il faut done  combattre, je vais les ecraser.\" He prepared for engagement, after  lining the bushes with detachments of Indians. Our men according to  orders, reserved their fire with a patience and tranquillity equal to  the resolution they had exerted in clambering the precipice--but when  they gave it, it took place with such terrible slaughter of the enemy,  that half an hour decided the day. The French fled precipitately, and  Montcalm, endeavouring to rally them, was killed on the spot. General  Monckton was wounded early, and obliged to retire. The fall of Wolfe was  noble indeed. He received a wound in the head, but covered it from his  soldiers with his handkerchief. A second ball struck him in the belly,  that too he dissembled. A third hitting him in the breast, he sunk under  the anguish, and was carried behind the ranks. Yet, as fast as life  ebbed out, his whole anxiety centred on the fortune of the day. He  begged to be borne nearer to the action; but his sight being dimmed by  the approach of death, he entreated to be told what they who supported  him saw; he was answered that the enemy gave ground. He eagerly  repeated the question, heard the enemy was totally routed, cried, \"I am  satisfied!\"--and expired--_Thackeray's Life of the Earl of Chatham_.           *       *       *       *       *      SYRIAN LOOKING GLASSES.    The Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria; and it is  curious to observe their manner of burnishing them. This operation is  performed before tempering, and they have for this purpose a small piece  of wood, in which is fixed an iron, which they run up and down the  blade, and thus clear off all inequalities, as a plane does to wood:  they then temper and polish it. This polish is so highly finished, that  when any one wants to arrange his turban, he uses his sword for a  looking-glass. As to its temper it is perfect, and I have nowhere seen  swords that cut so excellently. There are made at Damascus and in the  adjoining country mirrors of steel, that magnify objects like  burning-glasses. I have seen some that, when exposed to the sun, have  reflected the heat so strongly as to set fire to a plant fifteen or  sixteen feet distant!--_Broquiere's Travels to Jerusalem in 1432._           *       *       *       *       *      AUSTRALIAN PATRIOTISM.    A young Australian, on being once asked his opinion of a splendid shop  on Ludgate-hill, replied, in a disappointed tone, \"It is not equal to  _Big Cooper's_,\" (a store-shop in Sidney,) while Mrs. Rickards'  _Fashionable Repository_ is believed to be unrivalled, even in  Bond-street. Some of them also contrive to find out that the English  cows give _less_ milk and butter than the Australian, and the  choicest Newmarket racers possess _less_ beauty and swiftness than  _Junius_, _Modus_, _Currency Lass_, and others of Australian turf  pedigree; nay, even a young girl, when asked how she would like to go to  England, replied with great _naivete_, \"I should be afraid to go,  from the _number of thieves_ there,\" doubtless conceiving England  to be a downright hive of such, that threw off its annual swarms to  people the wilds of this colony. Nay, the very miserable looking trees  that cast their annual coats of bark, and present to the eye of a raw  European the appearance of being actually dead, I have heard praised as  objects of incomparable beauty! and I myself, so powerful is habit,  begin to look upon them pleasurably.
