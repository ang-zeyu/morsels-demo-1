Why should I talk like this, for I cannot be a boy again? But you boys  have your boyhood. It is a present reality. Let President Harper teach  you. Be the boy he pictures.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 103: 1-5        \"Bless the Lord, O my soul ... who satisfieth thy mouth with good      things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.\"    MEMORY HYMN [678]        _\"By cool Siloam's shady rill.\"_          ONE BY ONE      Here is this great church building. It is a beautiful structure, is it  not? It is so substantial, it has stood here so many years, we take it  so for granted that it seems as though it had always been here. But  there was a day when the ground upon which this building stands was  vacant ground. Then men came with picks and shovels, wagons and plows,  and set to work. They laid the foundations, stone upon stone. Then the  walls rose, stone upon stone. Then the spire, stone upon stone, until  the very peak was reached, for our church is stone from the foundation  to the top of the spire. How were these thousands of stones put in  place? One by one.    Think also of the roof of our church. It is a tile roof. How in the  world did they get all those tiles up on the roof and fitted in place?  Did some man who was very strong stand back and throw a handful of tile  at the roof? No, it was done one by one.    To-day it is snowing outside. Some one has figured that in a square  mile one foot of snow would weigh 65,000 tons. If you should take sleds  and horses, and put a ton of snow on each sled, and arrange the horses  and sleds in a procession, the sleds carrying the snow from that square  mile of territory would reach from Philadelphia to New York, and beyond  New York, straight up the Hudson, almost to Albany. That is only one  square mile, and there are thousands of square miles every winter  covered with snow. How does this snow come? In tiny flakes, one by one.    It is the same with life. God gives us many days, but he sends them one  at a time. He also sends us many duties, but they do not come en masse.  He is good and sends them one by one.    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew 6: 34_        \"Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall      take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is      the evil thereof.\"    MEMORY HYMN [419]        _\"One more day's work for Jesus.\"_          COME      There is not a girl or boy here this morning who does not feel within  the desire to do good. The drawing power of good--in other words, the  drawing power of God. He it is who says to you, \"Come.\"    I want to illustrate this by a few things which I have here. The first  is this magnet. And here are some small nails. These tiny nails  represent girls and boys of about eleven or twelve years of age. I apply  the magnet to these nails and I lift up--can you see me--twenty-five or  thirty nails. You see it is a great deal easier to respond to the  drawing power of good, to answer the great \"Come,\" in girlhood and  boyhood.    Now here are some nails that are a little larger. I can lift up only  five or six of these larger nails. They represent young people of  eighteen or nineteen. As one gets older he does not hear as readily, at  least he does not answer, Christ's blessed \"Come.\"    Next we have some nails still larger. The magnet will lift up only one  or two of these. They stand for men and women in mature life. Oh, if one  has not responded to Christ's call in childhood or youth, it becomes  increasingly difficult as the years pass. How seldom, how very seldom,  does an aged one answer the divine call and give his heart to the Lord!    Here is a very large nail, and it is rusty. Indeed it is literally  coated with rust. This represents the life that is deep in sin. For long  years this life has been persisting in his evil ways. As the magnet must  be very strong to penetrate the rust and grip the nail, so Christ's call  must be strong and loving to reach the sinful soul. Christ can save  \"from the uttermost,\" but how much better it is to say in early youth,  \"I hear thy voice, my Lord. Gladly I come.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 11: 28        \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will      give you rest.\"    MEMORY HYMN [462]        _\"In heavenly rest abiding.\"_          LOVE AND LOYALTY      Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was a man who had a wife and two  sons. There was a famine in the land where he lived, so he said to his  wife and sons, \"We will journey down to another country where the crops  have not failed. There shall we find plenty to eat, and there will we  make our home.\"    So the family moved to the strange land where they prospered and were  happy. In time the boys grew to young manhood and married young women of  the new land where they dwelt. Then sorrow entered their homes, as  sorrow comes sooner or later to every home. The father and the two sons  died, and the mother and her two daughters-in-law were left alone. The  mother, whose name was Naomi, said, \"I am going back to the land where I  lived in former days, back to the people of my girlhood.\" The young  women said, \"We shall go with you also.\" \"No,\" replied Naomi, \"you must  not do that. Go back to your homes, there you shall be cared for, and  may the Lord deal gently with you.\"    The names of these two daughters-in-law were Ruth and Orpah. It was  Ruth who then spoke up and said in words that are not surpassed in all  the English language:        \"Intreat me not to leave thee, Or to return from following after      thee; For whither thou goest I will go; And where thou lodgest I      will lodge; Thy people shall be my people, And thy God my God;      Where thou diest will I die, And there will I be buried; The Lord      do so to me, and even more, If ought but death part thee and me.\"    Great words are these, words of love and loyalty.    MEMORY VERSE, _Exodus_ 20: 12        \"Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon      the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\"    MEMORY HYMN [668]        _\"O perfect love, all human thought transcending.\"_          KUMMOGOKDONATTOOTTAMMOCTITEAONGANNUNNONASH      What do you think of this word? It contains forty-two letters.    What does it mean? What language is it? It means \"catechism.\" It is the  Indian language.    Now for the story. Many years ago, soon after the landing of the first  Pilgrim Fathers in New England, there was a man by the name of John  Eliot, who came to this new and unsettled country of America. He was a  devoted Christian, an earnest, patient, persistent missionary. He lived  for sixty years in Massachusetts, and most of those years were spent  among the redskins who inhabited that section. He loved them, worked  with them, learned their language, reduced it to writing, then  translated for them the Scriptures. He was called, and he is still known  by the name, \"Apostle to the Indians.\" The word at the head of the page  shows what labors he entered into. All this was made possible through  putting into practice his own motto, \"Prayer and pains, through faith  in Christ, will do anything.\"    What good John Eliot did for the Indians some one must have done for the  human race. Who invented the first alphabet? Who conceived the idea of  letters? Who planned out the putting of certain letters together to form  a word, then placing certain words in a string to form a sentence, that  sentence conveying an idea? Who did all this? We do not know. The  blessed work has gone on, until the knowledge of letters is so taken for  granted that we have a saying, \"as plain as ABC.\"    The Bible has almost kept pace with language. There are few languages  to-day into which the Word has not been translated. We shall not rest  until every child of every tongue is able to read God's message of love  and salvation in the language in which he was born.    MEMORY VERSE, _Luke_ 4: 16    \"And Jesus came to Nazareth ... and, as his custom was, he went into the  synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.\"    MEMORY HYMN [200]        _\"O word of God incarnate.\"_          WHAT THE TREES SAID TO ME      Across the street from my home is a large and beautiful park. It has  inviting, winding paths, great quantities of flowers and many varieties  of trees. Early one summer day, before most people were up, I strolled  through the park. I thought I was all alone, but suddenly I heard a  voice, \"Stand erect. Do not walk with stooping shoulders. Head up,  shoulders back!\" Now I confess I was walking, and thinking as I walked,  with shoulders bent and head forward. At once I straightened up and  looked about to see who was speaking. It was the voice of a pine tree,  growing hard by the path, tall and straight as a plumb line. \"Thank  you,\" I said to the pine.    No sooner had I left the pine, and was again deep in thought, when I  heard another voice. \"Be courteous, you can never accomplish anything by  scolding, insulting or driving people. Be fair and just. Be like Christ,  a Christian gentleman.\" Now who in the world is speaking to me? I looked  everywhere and there was not the sign of a person in all the park.  \"Here I am,\" the voice said. I looked and there, right before me, was a  graceful elm tree, smiling and courteously bowing low to me. \"I shall  try and heed your word,\" I said.    Going on my way I was no longer absorbed in thought, for I knew that  other trees would have something to say. Sure enough, \"Be steadfast,\" I  heard. What tree could that be? I should have known at once. The maple,  of course.    Now the white birch beckons. How its face shines in the light of the  early morning! But dark or light I can distinguish it from all its  fellows. Always white of face and clean of life. So I hear it say, \"Be  clean.\"    Turning my steps homeward I said to the kindly trees, \"Good-by, and  thank you.

Daughter of Leda, watcher of my fold,  In sooth thy welcome, grave and amply told,  Fitteth mine absent years. Though it had been  Seemlier, methinks, some other, not my Queen,  Had spoke these honours. For the rest, I say,  Seek not to make me soft in woman's way;  Cry not thy praise to me wide-mouthed, nor fling  Thy body down, as to some barbarous king.  Nor yet with broidered hangings strew my path,  To awake the unseen ire. 'Tis God that hath  Such worship; and for mortal man to press  Rude feet upon this broidered loveliness ...  I vow there is danger in it. Let my road  Be honoured, surely; but as man, not god.  Rugs for the feet and yonder broidered pall ...  The names ring diverse!... Aye, and not to fall  Suddenly blind is of all gifts the best  God giveth, for I reckon no man blest  Ere to the utmost goal his race be run.    So be it; and if, as this day I have done,  I shall do always, then I fear no ill.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Tell me but this, nowise against thy will ...    AGAMEMNON.    My will, be sure, shall falter not nor fade.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Was this a vow in some great peril made?    AGAMEMNON.    Enough! I have spoke my purpose, fixed and plain.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Were Priam the conqueror ... Think, would he refrain?    AGAMEMNON.    Oh, stores of broideries would be trampled then!    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Lord, care not for the cavillings of men!    AGAMEMNON.    The murmur of a people hath strange weight.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Who feareth envy, feareth to be great.    AGAMEMNON.    'Tis graceless when a woman strives to lead.    CLYTEMNESTRA.    When a great conqueror yields, 'tis grace indeed,    AGAMEMNON.    So in this war thou must my conqueror be?    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Yield! With good will to yield is victory!    AGAMEMNON.    Well, if I needs must ... Be it as thou hast said!    Quick! Loose me these bound slaves on which I tread,  And while I walk yon wonders of the sea  God grant no eye of wrath be cast on me  From far!      [_The Attendants untie his shoes_.              For even now it likes me not  To waste mine house, thus marring underfoot  The pride thereof, and wondrous broideries  Bought in far seas with silver. But of these  Enough.--And mark, I charge thee, this princess  Of Ilion; tend her with all gentleness.  God's eye doth see, and loveth from afar,  The merciful conqueror. For no slave of war  Is slave by his own will. She is the prize  And chosen flower of Ilion's treasuries,  Set by the soldiers' gift to follow me.    Now therefore, seeing I am constrained by thee  And do thy will, I walk in conqueror's guise  Beneath my Gate, trampling sea-crimson dyes.

And we, by right indued,  Possess our fill thereof. Thy house, O King,  Knoweth no stint, nor lack of anything.    What trampling of rich raiment, had the cry  So sounded in the domes of prophesy,  Would I have vowed these years, as price to pay  For this dear life in peril far away!  Where the root is, the leafage cometh soon  To clothe an house, and spread its leafy boon  Against the burning star; and, thou being come,  Thou, on the midmost hearthstone of thy home,  Oh, warmth in winter leapeth to thy sign.  And when God's summer melteth into wine  The green grape, on that house shall coolness fall  Where the true man, the master, walks his hall.      Zeus, Zeus! True Master, let my prayers be true!  And, oh, forget not that thou art willed to do!      [_She follows_ AGAMEMNON _into the Palace. The retinues of both King and  Queen go in after them._ CASSANDRA _remains_.    CHORUS.      What is this that evermore,                         [_Strophe 1._    A cold terror at the door  Of this bosom presage-haunted,    Pale as death hovereth?  While a song unhired, unwanted,  By some inward prophet chanted,    Speaks the secret at its core;    And to cast it from my blood    Like a dream not understood    No sweet-spoken Courage now    Sitteth at my heart's dear prow.      Yet I know that manifold    Days, like sand, have waxen old    Since the day those shoreward-thrown    Cables flapped and line on line  Standing forth for Ilion    The long galleys took the brine                                                          [_Antistrophe 1._    And in harbour--mine own eye    Hath beheld--again they lie;  Yet that lyreless music hidden    Whispers still words of ill,  'Tis the Soul of me unbidden,  Like some Fury sorrow-ridden,    Weeping over things that die.    Neither waketh in my sense    Ever Hope's dear confidence;    For this flesh that groans within,    And these bones that know of Sin,    This tossed heart upon the spate    Of a whirpool that is Fate,    Surely these lie not. Yet deep      Beneath hope my prayer doth run,    All will die like dreams, and creep      To the unthought of and undone.
