No doubt our very variable spring is the cause  of this. I intended to have brought the variations [see No. 259] yesterday;  they may well boldly face the light of day, and no doubt Y.R.H. will  receive an application for your consent on this point. I very much regret  being only able to express a _pia desideria_ for Y.R.H's. health. I  earnestly hope the skill of your Aesculapius may at length gain the victory  and procure permanent health for Y.R.H.    [K.]      266.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Moedling, July 15, 1819.    I have been very ill since my last visit to Y.R.H. in town; I hope however  to be much better by next week, in which case I will instantly join Y.R.H.  at Baden. Meanwhile I went several times to town to consult my physician.  My continued distress about my nephew, whose moral character has been  almost totally ruined, has been the main cause of my illness. At the  beginning of this week I was obliged to resume my guardianship, the other  guardian having resigned, and much has taken place for which he has asked  my forgiveness. The solicitor has also given up his office, because, having  interested himself in the good cause, he has been loudly accused of  partiality. Thus these endless perplexities go on, and no help, no  consolation! The whole fabric that I had reared now blown away as if by the  wind! A pupil of Pestalozzi, at present an inmate of the Institute where I  have placed my nephew, seems to think that it will be a difficult matter  for him and for my poor Carl to attain any desirable goal. But he is also  of opinion that the most advisable step is the removal of my nephew to a  foreign country! I hope that the health of Y.R.H., always so interesting to  me, leaves nothing to be desired, and I look forward with pleasure to soon  being with Y.R.H., that I may be enabled to prove my anxiety to serve you.    [K.]      267.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1819.    May I beg the favor of Y.R.H. to inform H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig of the  following circumstances. Y.R.H. no doubt remembers my mentioning the  necessary removal of my nephew from here, on account of his mother. My  intention was to present a petition to H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig on the  subject; no difficulties however have hitherto arisen on the subject, as  all the authorities concerned are in my favor. Among the chief of these are  the College of Privy Councillors, the Court of Guardians, and the guardian  himself, who all entirely agree with me in thinking that nothing can be  more conducive to the welfare of my nephew than being kept at the greatest  possible distance from his mother; moreover, all is admirably arranged for  the education of my nephew in Landshut, as the estimable and renowned  Professor Sailer is to superintend everything connected with the studies of  the youth, and I have also some relations there, so no doubt the most  desirable results may be thus attained for my nephew. Having, as I already  said, as yet encountered no obstacles, I had no wish whatever to trouble  H.R.H. the Archduke Ludwig, but I now understand that the mother of my  nephew intends to demand an audience from H.R.H. in order to _oppose_ my  scheme. She will not scruple to utter all sorts of _calumnies against me_,  but I trust these can be easily refuted by my well known and acknowledged  moral character, and I can fearlessly appeal to Y.R.H. for a testimony on  this point for the satisfaction of H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig. As for the  conduct of the mother of my nephew, it is easily to be inferred from the  fact of her having been declared by the Court wholly incapable of  undertaking the guardianship of her son. All that she _plotted_ in order to  ruin her poor child can only be credited from her own depravity, and thence  arises the _unanimous agreement_ about this affair, and the boy being  entirely withdrawn from her influence. Such is the natural and unnatural  state of the case. I therefore beg Y.R.H. to intercede with H.R.H. Archduke  Ludwig, and to warn him against listening to the slanders of the mother,  who would plunge her child into an abyss whence he could never be rescued.  That sense of justice which guides every party in our just Austrian land,  does not entirely exclude her either; at the same time, this _very same  sense of justice_ must render all her remonstrances unavailing. A religious  view of the Fourth Commandment is what chiefly decides the Court to send  away the son as far as possible. The difficulty those must have who conduct  the boy's education in not offending against this commandment, and the  necessity that the son should never be tempted to fail in this duty or to  repudiate it, ought certainly to be taken into consideration. Every effort  has been made by forbearance and generosity to amend this unnatural mother,  but all has been in vain. If necessary I will supply H.R.H. Archduke Ludwig  with a statement on the subject, and, favored by the advocacy of my  gracious master Y.R.H. the Archduke Rudolph, I shall certainly obtain  justice.    [K.]      268.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1819.    I regret to say that, owing to a judicial meeting about the affairs of my  nephew (being unable to alter the hour fixed), I must give up the pleasure  of waiting on Y.R.H. this evening, but shall not fail to do so to-morrow at  half-past four o'clock. As for the affair itself, I know that I shall be  treated with indulgence. May Heaven at length bring it to a close! for my  mind suffers keenly from such a painful turmoil.    [K.]      269.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Moedling, July 29, 1819.    I heard with deep regret of Y.R.H.'s recent indisposition, and having  received no further reliable information on the subject, I am extremely  uneasy. I went to Vienna to search in Y.R.H.'s library for what was most  suitable to me. The chief object must be to _hit off our idea at once_, and  _in accordance with a high class of art_, unless the object in view should  require different and more _practical_ treatment. On this point the ancient  composers offer the best examples, as most of these possess real artistic  value (though among them the _German Handel_ and Sebastian Bach can alone  lay claim to _genius_); but _freedom_ and _progress_ are our true aim in  the world of art, just as in the great creation at large; and if we moderns  are not so far advanced as our _forefathers_ in _solidity_, still the  refinement of our ideas has contributed in many ways to their enlargement.  My illustrious musical pupil, himself a competitor for the laurels of fame,  must not incur the reproach of _onesidedness, et iterum venturus judicare  vivos et mortuos_. I send you three poems, from which Y.R.H. might select  one to set to music. The Austrians have now learned that the _spirit of  Apollo_ wakes afresh in the Imperial House; I receive from all sides  requests for something of yours. The editor of the \"Mode Zeitung\" is to  write to Y.R.H. on the subject. I only hope that I shall not be accused of  being _bribed_--to be _at court and yet no courtier_! After that, what is  not credible??!!!    _I met with some opposition from His Excellency the Obersthofmeister[1] in  selecting the music._ It is not worth while to trouble Y.R.H. on the  subject in writing; but this I will say, that such conduct might have the  effect of repelling many talented, good, and noble-minded men, who had not  enjoyed the good fortune to learn from personal intercourse with Y.R.H. all  the admirable qualities of your mind and heart. I wish Y.R.H. a speedy,  speedy recovery, and, _for my own peace of mind_, that I may hear some good  tidings of Y.R.H.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: Probably the Obersthofmeister, Count Laurencin, by no means  approved of the manner in which Beethoven searched for music, which  accounts for this outbreak on the part of the irritable _maestro_.]      270.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1819.    I have unhappily only myself to blame! I went out yesterday for the first  time, feeling pretty well, but I forgot, or rather paid no attention to the  fact, that, being an invalid only just recovering, I ought to have gone  home early; I have consequently brought on another attack. I think,  however, that by staying at home to-day, all will be right by to-morrow,  when I hope to be able to wait on my esteemed and illustrious pupil without  fail. I beg Y.R.H. not to forget about Handel's works, as they certainly  offer to your mature musical genius the highest nourishment, and their  study will always be productive of admiration of this great man.    [K.]      271.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Moedling, Aug. 31, 1819.    I yesterday received the intelligence _of a fresh recognition and homage[1]  offered to the admirable qualities of your head and heart_. I beg that  Y.R.H. will graciously accept my congratulations. They spring from the  heart, and do not require to be suggested! I hope things will soon go  better with me also. So much annoyance has had a most prejudicial effect on  my health, and I am thus far from well; so for some time past I have been  obliged to undergo a course of medicine which has only permitted me to  devote myself for a few hours in the day to the most cherished boon of  Heaven, my art and the Muses. I hope, however, to be able to finish the  Mass[2] so that it can be performed on the 19th--if that day is still  fixed. I should really be in despair[3] were I prevented by bad health from  being ready by that time. I trust, however, that my sincere wishes for the  accomplishment of this task may be fulfilled. As to that _chef-d'oeuvre_,  the variations of Y.R.H., I think they should be published under the  following title:--    Theme or Subject  composed by L. van Beethoven,  forty times varied,  and dedicated to his Instructor,  by the Illustrious Author.

Since  the Queen had her pet musical composer, Mme. du Barry wished to have  hers. An Italian by birth, she could gather about her a powerful  Italian faction, who were bent upon opposition to the Austrian Gluck.  She had listened to his praises long enough, and the tremendous  success of \"Alceste\" had been the last straw and brought things to a  climax. Du Barry would have some one to represent Italian music, and  applied to the Italian ambassador to desire Piccini to come to Paris.    On the arrival of Piccini, Madame du Barry began activities, aided by  Louis XV himself. She gathered a powerful Italian party about her,  and their first act was to induce the Grand Opera management to make  Piccini an offer for a new opera, although they had already made the  same offer to Gluck. This breach of good faith led to a furious war,  in which all Paris joined; it was fierce and bitter while it lasted.  Even politics were forgotten for the time being. Part of the press  took up one side and part the other. Many pamphlets, poems and satires  appeared, in which both composers were unmercifully attacked. Gluck  was at the time in Germany, and Piccini had come to Paris principally  to secure the tempting fee offered him. The leaders of the feud kept  things well stirred up, so that a stranger could not enter a cafe,  hotel or theater without first answering the question whether he stood  for Gluck or Piccini. Many foolish lies were told of Gluck in his  absence. It was declared by the Piccinists that he went away on  purpose, to escape the war; that he could no longer write melodies  because he was a dried up old man and had nothing new to give France.  These lies and false stories were put to flight one evening when the  Abbe Arnaud, one of Gluck's most ardent adherents, declared in an  aristocratic company, that the Chevalier was returning to France with  an \"Orlando\" and an \"Armide\" in his portfolio.    \"Piccini is also working on an 'Orlando,'\" spoke up a follower of that  redoubtable Italian.    \"That will be all the better,\" returned the abbe, \"for we shall then  have an 'Orlando' and also an 'Orlandino.'\"    When Gluck arrived in Paris, he brought with him the finished opera of  \"Armide,\" which was produced at the Paris Grand Opera on September  23, 1777. At first it was merely a _succes d'estime_, but soon became  immensely popular. On the first night many of the critics were against  the opera, which was called too noisy. The composer, however, felt he  had done some of his best work in \"Armide\"; that the music was written  in such style that it would not grow old, at least not for a long  time. He had taken the greatest pains in composing it, and declared  that if it were not properly rehearsed at the Opera he would not let  them have it at all, but would retain the work himself for his own  pleasure. He wrote to a friend: \"I have put forth what little strength  is left in me, into 'Armide'; I confess I should like to finish my  career with it.\"    It is said the Gluck composed \"Armide\" in order to praise the beauty  of Marie Antoinette, and she for her part showed the deepest interest  in the success of the piece, and really \"became quite a slave to  it.\" Gluck often told her he \"rearranged his music according to the  impression it made upon the Queen.\"    \"Great as was the success of 'Armide,'\" wrote the Princess de  Lamballe, \"no one prized this beautiful work more highly than the  composer of it. He was passionately enamored of it; he told the Queen  the air of France had rejuvenated his creative powers, and the sight  of her majesty had given such a wonderful impetus to the flow  of ideas, that his composition had become like herself, angelic,  sublime.\"    The growing success of \"Armide\" only added fuel to the flame of  controversy which had been stirred up. To cap the climax, Piccini  had finished his opera, which was duly brought out and met with a  brilliant reception. Indeed its success was greater than that won by  \"Armide,\" much to the delight of the Piccinists. Of course the natural  outcome was that the other party should do something to surpass the  work of their rivals. Marie Antoinette was besought to prevail on  Gluck to write another opera.    A new director was now in charge of the Opera House. He conceived the  bright idea of setting the two composers at work on the same subject,  which was to be \"Iphigenie en Tauride.\" This plan made great commotion  in the ranks of the rival factions, as each wished to have their  composer's work performed first. The director promised that Piccini's  opera should be first placed in rehearsal. Gluck soon finished his  and handed it in, but the Italian, trusting to the director's word of  honor, was not troubled when he heard the news, though he determined  to complete his as soon as possible. A few days later, when he went to  the Opera House with his completed score, he was horrified to find the  work of his rival already in rehearsal. There was a lively scene, but  the manager said he had received orders to produce the work of Gluck  at once, and he must obey. On the 18th of May, 1779, the Gluck opera  was first performed. It produced the greatest excitement and had a  marvelous success. Even Piccini succumbed to the spell, for the music  made such an impression on him that he did not wish his own work to be  brought out.    The director, however, insisted, and soon after the second Iphigenie  appeared. The first night the opera did not greatly please; the next  night proved a comic tragedy, as the prima donna was intoxicated.  After a couple of days' imprisonment she returned and sang well. But  the war between the two factions continued till the death of Gluck,  and the retirement of Piccini.    The following year, in September, Gluck finished a new opera, \"Echo et  Narcisse,\" and with this work decided to close his career, feeling he  was too old to write longer for the lyric stage. He was then nearly  seventy years old, and retired to Vienna, to rest and enjoy the fruits  of all his years of incessant toil. He was now rich, as he had earned  nearly thirty thousand pounds. Kings and princes came to do him honor,  and to tell him what pleasure his music had always given them.    Gluck passed away on November 15, 1787, honored and beloved by all.  The simple beauty and purity of his music are as moving and expressive  to-day as when it was written, and the \"Michael of Music\" speaks to us  still in his operas, whenever they are adequately performed.          V    JOSEF HAYDN      In Josef Haydn we have one of the classic composers, a sweet, gentle  spirit, who suffered many privations in early life, and through his  own industrious efforts rose to positions of respect and honor, the  result of unremitting toil and devotion to a noble ideal. Like many  of the other great musicians, through hardship and sorrow he won his  place among the elect.    Fifteen leagues south of Vienna, amid marshy flats along the river  Leitha, lies the small village of Rehrau. At the end of the straggling  street which constitutes the village, stood a low thatched cottage  and next to it a wheelwright's shop, with a small patch of greensward  before it. The master wheelwright, Mathias Haydn, was sexton, too, of  the little church on the hill. He was a worthy man and very religious.  A deep love for music was part of the man's nature, and it was shared  to a large extent by his wife Maria. Every Sunday evening he would  bring out his harp, on which he had taught himself to play, and he  and his wife would sing songs and hymns, accompanied by the harp. The  children, too, would add their voices to the concert. The little  boy Josef, sat near his father and watched his playing with rapt  attention. Sometimes he would take two sticks and make believe play  the violin, just as he had seen the village schoolmaster do. And  when he sang hymns with the others, his voice was sweet and true. The  father watched the child with interest, and a new hope rose within  him. His own life had been a bitter disappointment, for he had been  unable to satisfy his longing for a knowledge of the art he loved.  Perhaps Josef might one day become a musician--indeed he might even  rise to be Capellmeister.    Little Josef was born March 31, 1732. The mother had a secret desire  that the boy should join the priesthood, but the father, as we have  seen, hoped he would make a musical career, and determined, though  poor in this world's goods, to aid him in every possible way.    About this time a distant relative, one Johann Mathias Frankh by name,  arrived at the Haydn cottage on a visit. He was a schoolmaster at  Hainburg, a little town four leagues away. During the regular evening  concert he took particular notice of Josef and his toy violin. The  child's sweet voice indicated that he had the makings of a good  musician. At last he said: \"If you will let me take Sepperl, I will  see he is properly taught; I can see he promises well.\"    The parents were quite willing and as for little Sepperl, he was  simply overjoyed, for he longed to learn more about the beautiful  music which filled his soul. He went with his new cousin, as he called  Frankh, without any hesitation, and with the expectation that his  childish day dreams were to be realized.    A new world indeed opened to the six year old boy, but it was not all  beautiful. Frankh was a careful and strict teacher; Josef not only was  taught to sing well, but learned much about various instruments.  He had school lessons also. But his life in other ways was hard  and cheerless. The wife of his cousin treated him with the utmost  indifference, never looking after his clothing or his well being in  any way. After a time his destitute and neglected appearance was  a source of misery to the refined, sensitive boy, but he tried to  realize that"]]]
