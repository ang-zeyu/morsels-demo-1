They told him that anyone travelling up the Richelieu  River (as it was called sixty years later) would eventually reach a  land in the south where in the winter there was no ice or snow, and  where fruit and nut trees grew in abundance. Cartier thought that they  were talking to him of Florida, but their geographical information can  scarcely have stretched so far; they probably referred to the milder  regions of New Jersey and Virginia, which would be reached by  following southwards the valley of the Hudson and keeping to the  lowlands of the eastern United States.    [Footnote 8: \"There groweth also a certain kind of herb whereof in  summer they make a great provision for all the year, making great  account of it, and only men use it; and first they cause it to be  dried in the sun, then wear it about their necks wrapped in a little  beast's skin made like a bag, together with a hollow piece of stone or  wood like a pipe. Then when they please they make powder of it and put  it in one of the ends of the said cornet or pipe, and laying a coal of  fire upon it at the other end, suck so long that they fill their  bodies full of smoke, till that it cometh out of their mouth and  nostrils, even as out of the tunnel of a chimney. They say that this  doth keep them warm and in health: they never go without some of it  about them. We ourselves have tried the same smoke, and having put it  in our mouths, it seemed almost as hot as pepper.\" The foregoing is  one of the earliest descriptions of tobacco smoking in any European  language, the original words being in Cartier's Norman French.]    As the winter set in with its customary Canadian severity the real  trouble of the French began. They did not suffer from the cold, but  they were dying of scurvy. This disease, from which the natives also  suffered to some extent, was due to their eating nothing but salt or  smoked provisions--forms of meat or fish. They lived, of course, shut  up in the fort, and Cartier's fixed idea was to keep the Hurons from  the knowledge of his misfortune, fearing lest, if they realized how  the garrison was reduced, they might treacherously attack and massacre  the rest; for in spite of the extravagant joy with which their arrival  had been greeted, the Amerindians--notably the two interpreters who  had been to France and returned--showed at intervals signs of disquiet  and a longing to be rid of these mysterious white men, whose coming  might involve the country in unknown misfortunes. In January and  February, also, Donnacona and these two interpreters and many of the  Huron men had been absent hunting in the forests, so that there was no  one among the Amerindians to whom the French could turn for  information regarding this strange disease. At last 25 out of the 112  who had left France were dead, and of the remainder only 10 men,  including Cartier, were not grievously ill. Those who were living  found it sometimes beyond their strength to bury the dead in the  frozen ground, and simply placed their bodies in deep snow. Once or  twice, when Cartier left the fort to go out to the ships, he met  Domagaya, one of the two interpreters, and found that he also was  suffering from this mysterious disease, though not nearly so badly as  the French people. On the body of one young man who died of scurvy  Cartier and his officers, shuddering, made investigations, opening the  corpse and examining the organs to try and find the cause of death.  This was on the afternoon of a day on which they had held a solemn  service before a statue erected to the Virgin Mary on the shore  opposite to the ships. All who were fit to walk went in procession  from the fort to the statue, singing penitential psalms and the Litany  and celebrating Mass.    Some days after this religious service Cartier met the interpreter,  Domagaya, and to his surprise found him perfectly well and strong. He  asked him for an explanation, and was told that the medicine which  cured this disease was made from the leaves and bark of a tree called  ameda.[9] Cartier then ventured to say that one of his servants was  sick of this unknown disease, and Domagaya sent for two women, who  taught the French people how to make an extract from the balsam fir  for drinking, and how to apply the same liquid to the inflamed skin.  The effect on the crews was miraculous. In six days all the sick were  well and strong.    [Footnote 9: This tree was the balsam fir, _Abies balsamea_.]    Then came the sudden spring. Between April 15th and May 1st the ice on  the river was all melted, and on the 6th May, 1536, Cartier started  from the vicinity of Quebec to return to France. But before leaving he  had managed to kidnap Donnacona, the chief of the Huron settlement,  and six or seven other Amerindians, amongst them Tainyoanyi, one of  the two interpreters who had already been to France. He seized these  men, it appears, partly because he wanted hostages and had good reason  to fear that the Indians meditated a treacherous attack on his ships  before they could get away. He also wished for native witnesses at  Court, when he reached France, to testify to the truth of his  discoveries, and even more to convince the King of France that there  was great profit to be obtained from giving effect to Cartier's  explorations. The chief, Donnacona, was full of wonderful stories of  the Saguenay region, and of the great lakes to the northwards of  Quebec. Probably he was only alluding to the wealth of copper now  known to exist in northern Canada, but to Cartier and the other  Frenchmen it seemed as though he spoke of gold and silver, rubies, and  other precious stones.    Donnacona's people howled and wept when their chief was seized; but  Cartier obliged the chief to reassure them, and to say that the French  had promised to bring him back after he had paid a visit to their  great king, who would return him to his country with great presents.  As a matter of fact, not one of these Indians rapt away by Cartier  ever saw Canada again. But this was not the fault of Cartier, but of  the distractions of the times which turned away the thoughts of King  Francis I from American adventures. The Indians were well and kindly  treated in France, but all of them died there before Cartier left St.  Malo to return to Canada in 1541.    One advantage he derived from sailing away with these hostages was (no  doubt) that they could give him geographical information of importance  which materially shortened the return journey. For the first time he  made use of the broad strait between Anticosti Island and Gaspe  Peninsula, and, better still, entered the Atlantic, not by the  dangerous northern route through the straits of Belle Isle, but by  means of Cabot Strait, between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island. Of  these discoveries he availed himself on his third and last voyage in  1541.    When in that year he once more anchored his ships near Quebec he found  the attitude of the Hurons changed. They enquired about their friends  and relations who had been carried off five years before, and although  they pretended to be reconciled to their fate when they heard (not  altogether truly) that one or two were dead, and the others had become  great lords in France and had married French women, they really felt a  disappointment so bitter and a hostility so great that Cartier guessed  their expressions of welcome to be false. However, he sent back to  France two of the ships under his command and beached the other three,  landed his stores, built two forts at Cap Rouge, above and below, and  then started off with a few of his men and two boats to revisit the  country of Hochelaga. Here he intended to examine the three rapids or  \"saults\"--interruptions to the navigation of the St. Lawrence--which  he had observed on his previous journey, and which were later named  the La Chine Rapids (in the belief that they were obstacles on the  river route to China). But these falls proved insuperable obstacles to  his boats, and he gave up any further idea of westward exploration,  returned to his forts and ships near Quebec, and there laid the  foundations of a fortified town, which he called Charlesbourg Royal.  Here he spent a very difficult winter, the Hurons in the neighbourhood  becoming increasingly hostile, and at last, when the spring came, as  he had received no relief from France, he took to his three ships,  abandoned Charlesbourg Royal (having probably to do some fighting  before he could get safely away) and thence sailed for France. Off the  Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland he met the other ships of the  expedition which was to have occupied Canada for France. These were  under the command of the Sieur de Roberval, a French nobleman, who had  really been made head of the whole enterprise, with Cartier as a  subordinate officer, but who, the year before, had allowed Cartier to  go off to Canada and prepare the way, promising to follow immediately.  The interview between Cartier and Roberval, near where the capital of  Newfoundland (St. John's) now stands, was a stormy one. Roberval  ordered Cartier to return at once to Charlesbourg and await his  arrival. However, in the middle of the night which followed this  interview, Cartier took advantage of a favourable wind and set sail  for France, arriving soon afterwards at St. Malo.    But Roberval arrived at Charlesbourg (going the roundabout way through  the straits of Belle Isle, for Cartier had told him nothing of the  convenient passage through Cabot Strait), and there spent the winter  of 1542-3, sending his ships back to France. This winter was one of  horrors. Roberval was a headstrong, passionate man, perfectly reckless  of human life. He maintained discipline by ferocious sentences,  putting many of his men in irons, whipping others cruelly, women as  well as men, and shooting those who seemed the most rebellious. Even  the Indians were moved to pity, and wept"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13007"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"  the Thunderer's hammer.    15. Then spoke Heimdal, whitest of the Aesir; he could see into the  future like the Vanir: \"Let us bind on Thor the bridal veil; let him  have the great necklace Brising.    16. \"Let the keys jingle, and let women's weeds fall about his knees;  let us put broad stones on his breast, and a hood dexterously on  his head.\"    17. Then spoke Thor, the mighty Asa: \"Vile would the Aesir call me,  if I let the bridal veil be bound on me.\"    18. Then spoke Loki, Laufey's son: \"Speak not such words, Thor! soon  will the Giants dwell in Asgard, unless thou bring home thy hammer.\"    19. Then they bound on Thor the bridal veil, and the great necklace  Brising; they let the keys jingle and women's weeds fall about  his knees, and they put broad stones on his breast, and the hood  dexterously on his head.    20. Then spoke Loki, Laufey's son: \"I also will go with thee as thy  maiden; we two will drive together to Joetunheim.\"    21. Then the goats were driven out, urged forward in their harness;  well must they run. Rocks were riven, the earth burned in name:  Odin's son was driving into Joetunheim.    22. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: \"Stand up, giants, and  strew the benches! They are bringing me now Freyja my bride, Njoerd's  daughter from Noatun.    23. \"Gold-horned kine run in the court, oxen all-black, the giant's  delight. I have many treasures, I have many jewels, Freyja only  is lacking.\"    24. The guests assembled early in the evening, and ale was carried  to the Giants. One ox did Sif's husband eat, and eight salmon, and  all the dishes prepared for the women; three casks of mead he drank.    25. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: \"Who ever saw a bride eat  so eagerly? I never saw a bride make such a hearty meal, nor a maid  drink so deep of mead.\"    26. The prudent handmaid sat near, and she found answer to the Giant's  words: \"Eight nights has Freyja eaten nothing, so eager was she to  be in Joetunheim.\"    27. He looked under the veil, he longed to kiss the bride, but  he started back the length of the hall: \"Why are Freyja's eyes so  terrible? Fire seems to burn from her eyes.\"    28. The prudent handmaid sat near, and she found answer to the Giant's  speech: \"Eight nights has Freyja had no sleep, so eager was she to  be in Joetunheim.\"    29. In came the Giants' wretched sister, she dared to ask for a bridal  gift: \"Take from thine arms the red rings, if thou wouldst gain my  love, my love and all my favour.\"    30. Then spoke Thrym, lord of the Giants: \"Bring the hammer to hallow  the bride. Lay Mjoellni on the maiden's knee, hallow us two in wedlock.\"    31. The Thunderer's heart laughed in his breast, when the bold of  soul felt the hammer. Thrym killed he first, the lord of the Giants,  and all the race of the Giants he struck.    32. He slew the Giants' aged sister, who had asked him for a bridal  gift. She got a blow instead of shillings, and a stroke of the hammer  for abundance of rings. So Odin's son got back his hammer.        Bibliography      I. Study in the Original.    (1) _Poetic Edda_.--The classic edition, and on the whole the best,  is Professor Bugge's (Christiania, 1867); the smaller editions of  Hildebrand (_Die Lieder der Aelteren Edda_, Paderborn, 1876), and  Finnur Jonsson (_Eddalieder_, Halle, 1888-90) are also good; the  latter is in two parts, _Goettersage_ and _Heldensage_. The poems may  also be found in the first volume of Vigfusson and Powell's _Corpus  Poeticum Boreale_ (Oxford, 1883), accompanied by translations; but in  many cases they are cut up and rearranged, and they suffer metrically  from the system adopted of printing two short lines as one long one,  with no dividing point. There is an excellent palaeographic edition  of the _Codex Regius of the Elder Edda_, by Wimmer and Finnur Jonsson  (Copenhagen, 1891), with photographic reproductions interleaved with  a literal transcription.    (2) _Snorra Edda_.--The most recent edition of the whole is Dr. Finnur  Jonsson's (Copenhagen, 1875). There is a useful edition of the  mythological portions _(i.e., Gylfaginning, Bragaraedur_, and the  narrative parts of _Skaldskaparmal_) by Ernst Wilken (_Die Prosaeische  Edda_, Paderborn, 1878).    (3) _Dictionaries and Grammars_.--For the study of the Poetic Edda,  Gering's _Glossar zu den Liedern der Edda_ (Paderborn, 1896) will  be found most useful; it is complete and trustworthy, and in small  compass. A similar service has been performed for _Snorra Edda_ in  Wilken's _Glossar_ (Paderborn, 1883), which forms a second volume to  his edition, mentioned above. Both are, of course, in German. The only  English dictionary is the lexicon of Cleasby and Vigfusson (Oxford).    Of Grammars, the best are German; those of Noreen (_Altnordische  Grammatik_, Halle, 1892), of which there is an abbreviated edition,  and Kahle (_Altislaendisches Elementarbuch_, Heidelberg, 1896) being  better suited for advanced students; the English grammars included  in Vigfusson and Powell's _Icelandic Reader_ (Oxford) and Sweet's  _Icelandic Primer_ (Oxford) are more elementary, and therefore hardly  adequate for the study of the verse literature.      II. Translations.    There are English translations of the Elder Edda by Anderson (Chicago,  1879) and Thorpe (1866), as well as the translations in the _Corpus  Poeticum_, which are, of course, liable to the same objection as  the text. The most accurate German translation is Gering's (Leipzig,  1893); in Simrock's (_Aeltere und Juengere Edda_, Stuttgart, 1882), the  translations of the verse Edda are based on an uncritical text. Snorra  Edda was translated into English by Dasent (Stockholm, 1842); also  by Anderson (Chicago, 1880).      III. Modern Authorities.    To the works on Northern mythology mentioned below in the note on  the Baldr theories, must be added Dr. Rydberg's _Teutonic Mythology_  (English version by R.B. Anderson, London, 1889), which devotes  special attention to Saxo.        Notes    _Home of the Edda_. (Page 2.)    The chief apologists for the British theory are Professor Bugge  (_Studien ueber die Entstehung der nordischen Goetter- und Heldensagen_,  Muenchen, 1889), and the editors of the _Corpus Poeticum Boreale_ (see  the Introduction to that  work, and also the Prolegomena prefixed to  their edition of the _Sturlunga Saga_, Oxford). The case for Norway  and Greenland is argued by Dr. Finnur Jonsson (_Den oldnorsk og  oldislandske Literaturs-Historie,_ Copenhagen). The cases for both  British and Norwegian origin are based chiefly on rather fanciful  arguments from supposed local colour. The theory of the _Corpus  Poeticum_ editors that many of the poems were composed in the Scottish  isles is discredited by the absence of Gaelic words or traces of Gaelic  legend. Professor Bugge's North of England theory is slightly stronger,  being supported by several Old English expressions in the poems,  but these are not enough to prove that they were composed in England,  since most Icelanders travelled east at some time of their lives.    (Page 3.)    A later study will deal with the Heroic legends.    _Ynglinga Saga_. (Page 3.)    _Ynglinga Saga_ is prefixed to the Lives of the Kings in the collection  known as _Heimskringla_ (edited by Unger, Christiania, 1868, and by  Finnur Jonsson, Christiania, 1893); there is an English translation  in Laing's _Lives of the Kings of Norway_ (London, 1889).    _Voeluspa_. (Page 4.)    A poem of similar form occurs among the heroic poems. _Gripisspa_,  a prophetic outline of Sigurd's life, introduces the Volsung poems,  as _Voeluspa_ does the Asgard cycle.    _Riddle-poems_. (Page 6.)    So many of the mythological poems are in this form that they suggest  the question, did the asking of riddles form any part of Scandinavian  ritual?    _The Aesir_. (Page 11.)    _Ynglinga Saga_ says that Odin and the Aesir came to Norway from Asia;  a statement due, of course, to a false etymology, though theories as  to the origin of Norse mythology have been based on it.    _Tyr_. (Page 12.)    Tyr is etymologically identical with Zeus, and with the Sanskrit Dyaus  (Sky-God).    _Baldr_. (Pages 16 to 22.)    The Baldr theories are stated in the following authorities:    (1) Ritual origin: Frazer, _The Golden Bough_, vol. 3.    (2) Heroic origin: Golther, _Handbuch der Germanischen Mythologie_  (Leipzig, 1895); Niedner, _Eddische Fragen_ (_Zeitschrift  fuer deutsches Altertum_, new series, 29), _Zur Lieder-Edda_  (_Zeitschr. f. d. Alt_. vol. 36).    (3) Solar myth: Sir G.W. Cox, _Mythology of the Aryan Nations_  (London, 1870); Max Mueller, _Chips from a German Workshop_, vol. 4.    (4) Borrowed: Bugge, _Studien ueber die Entstchung der nordischen  Goetter- und Heldensagen_ (transl. Brenner, Muenchen, 1889).    _Vegtamskvida_. (Page 17.)    The word _hrodhrbadhm_ (which I have given as \"branch of fame\")  would perhaps be more accurately translated \"tree of fame,\" which  Gering explains as a kenning for Baldr. But there are no kennings of  the same sort in the poem, and the line would have no meaning. If it  refers to the mistletoe, as most commentators agree, it merely shows  that the poet was ignorant of the nature of the plant, which would  be in favour of its antiquity, rather than the reverse.      _Saxo Grammaticus_. (Page 18.)    English translation by Professor Elton (London, D. Nutt, 1894). As  Saxo's references to the old Gods are made in much the same sympathetic  tone as that adopted by Old Testament writers towards heathen deities,  his testimony on mythological questions is of the less value.      _The Mistletoe_. (Page 20.)    It seems incredible that any writers should turn to the travesty of  the Baldr story given in the almost worthless saga of Hromund Gripsson  in support of a theory. In it \"Bildr\" is killed by Hromund, who has  the sword Mistilteinn. It must be patent to any one that this is a  perverted version of a story which the narrator no longer"]]]
