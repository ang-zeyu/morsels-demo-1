And each cast the other down and pressed him close to the ground. And  each got up again and squeezed the other in his arms. And each threw the  other violently off his place by boxing him on the breast. And each  caught the other by the legs and whirling him round threw him down on  the ground. And they slapped each other with their palms that struck as  hard as the thunderbolt. And they also struck each other with their  outstretched fingers, and stretching them out like spears thrust the  nails into each other's body. And they gave each other violent kicks.  And they struck knee and head against head, producing the crash of one  stone against another. And in this manner that furious combat between  those warriors raged on without weapons, sustained mainly by the power  of their arms and their physical and mental energy, to the infinite  delight of the concourse of spectators. And all people, O king, took  deep interest in that encounter of those powerful wrestlers who fought  like Indra and the Asura Vritra. And they cheered both of them with loud  acclamations of applause. And the broad-chested and long-armed experts  in wrestling then pulled and pressed and whirled and hurled down each  other and struck each other with their knees, expressing all the while  their scorn for each other in loud voices. And they began to fight with  their bare arms in this way, which were like spiked maces of iron. And  at last the powerful and mighty-armed Bhima, the slayer of his foes,  shouting aloud seized the vociferous athlete by the arms even as the  lion seizes the elephant, and taking him up from the ground and holding  him aloft, began to whirl him round, to the great astonishment of the  assembled athletes and the people of Matsya. And having whirled him  round and round a hundred times till he was insensible, the strong-armed  Vrikodara dashed him to death on the ground. And when the brave and  renowned Jimuta was thus killed, Virata and his friends were filled with  great delight. And in the exuberance of his joy, the noble-minded king  rewarded Vallava then and there with the liberality of Kuvera. And  killing numerous athletes and many other men possessed of great bodily  strength, he pleased the king very much. And when no one could be found  there to encounter him in the lists, the king made him fight with tigers  and lions and elephants. And the king also made him battle with furious  and powerful lions in the harem for the pleasure of the ladies. And  Arjuna, too, pleased the king and all the ladies of the inner apartments  by singing and dancing. And Nakula pleased Virata, that best of kings,  by showing him fleet and well-trained steeds that followed him wherever  he went. And the king, gratified with him, rewarded him with ample  presents. And beholding around Sahadeva a herd of well-trained bullocks,  Virata that bull among men, bestowed upon him also wealth of diverse  kinds. And, O king, Draupadi distressed to see all those warriors suffer  pain, sighed incessantly. And it was in this way that those eminent  persons lived there in disguise, rendering services unto king Virata.\"        [12] _Krita_--attack; _Pratikrita_--warding it off;      _Sankata_--clenched. _Some_ texts read _Sankatakais_. The      meaning then would be 'cased in gauntlets.'      SECTION XIV    (_Kichaka-badha Parva_)    Vaisampayana said, \"Living in such disguise, those mighty warriors, the  sons of Pritha, passed ten months in Matsya's city. And, O monarch,  although herself deserving to be waited upon by others, the daughter of  Yajnasena, O Janamejaya, passed her days in extreme misery, waiting upon  Sudeshna. And residing thus in Sudeshna's apartments, the princess of  Panchala pleased that lady as also the other females of the inner  apartments. And it came to pass that as the year was about to expire,  the redoubtable Kichaka, the Commander of Virata's forces, chanced to  behold the daughter of Drupada. And beholding that lady endued with the  splendour of a daughter of the celestials, treading the earth like a  goddess, Kichaka, afflicted with the shafts of Kama, desired to possess  her. And burning with desire's flame, Virata's general came to Sudeshna  (his sister) and smilingly addressed her in these words, 'This beauteous  lady had never before been seen by me in king Virata's abode. This  damsel maddens me with her beauty, even as a new wine maddens one with  its fragrance. Tell me, who is this graceful and captivating lady  possessed of the beauty of a goddess, and whose she is, and whence she  hath come. Surely, grinding my heart she hath reduced me to subjection.  It seems to me that (save her) there is no other medicine for my  illness. O, this fair hand-maid of thine seemeth to me to be possessed  of the beauty of a goddess. Surely, one like her is ill suited to serve  thee. Let her rule over me and whatever is mine. O, let her grace my  spacious and beautiful palace, decked with various ornaments of gold,  full of viands and drinks in profusion, with excellent plates, and  containing every kind of plenty, besides elephants and horses and cars  in myriads.' And having consulted with Sudeshna thus, Kichaka went to  princess Draupadi, and like a jackal in the forest accosting a lioness,  spoke unto Krishna these words in a winning voice, 'Who and whose art  thou, O beautiful one? And O thou of beautiful face, whence hast thou  come to the city of Virata? Tell me all this, O fair lady. Thy beauty  and gracefulness are of the very first order and the comeliness of thy  features is unparalleled. With its loveliness thy face shineth ever like  the resplendent moon. O thou of fair eye-brows, thy eyes are beautiful  and large like lotus-petals. Thy speech also, O thou of beautiful limbs,  resembles the notes of the _cuckoo_. O thou of fair hips, never before  in this world have I beheld a woman possessed of beauty like thine, O  thou of faultless features. Art thou Lakshmi herself having her abode in  the midst of lotuses or, art thou, O slender-waisted one, she who is  called _Bhuti_[13]. Or, which amongst these--_Hri, Sri, Kirti_ and  _Kanti_,--art thou, O thou of beautiful face? Or possessed of beauty  like Rati's, art thou, she who sporteth in the embraces of the God of  love? O thou that possessest the fairest of eye-brows, thou shinest  beautifully even like the lovely light of the moon. Who is there in the  whole world that will not succumb to the influence of desire beholding  thy face? Endued with unrivalled beauty and celestial grace of the most  attractive kind, that face of thine is even like the full moon, its  celestial effulgence resembling his radiant face, its smile resembling  his soft-light, and its eye-lashes looking like the spokes on his disc.  Both thy bosoms, so beautiful and well-developed and endued with  unrivalled gracefulness and deep and well-rounded and without any space  between them, are certainly worthy of being decked with garlands of  gold. Resembling in shape the beautiful buds of the lotus, these thy  breasts, O thou of fair eye-brows, are even as the whips of Kama that  are urging me forward, O thou of sweet smiles. O damsel of slender  waist, beholding that waist of thine marked with four wrinkles and  measuring but a span, and slightly stooping forward because of the  weight of thy breasts, and also looking on those graceful hips of thine  broad as the banks of a river, the incurable fever of desire, O  beauteous lady, afflicteth me sore. The flaming fire of desire, fierce  as a forest conflagration, and fanned by the hope my heart cherisheth of  a union with thee is consuming me intensely. O thou of exceeding beauty  quench thou that flaming fire kindled by Manmatha. Union with thee is a  rain-charged cloud, and the surrender of thy person is the shower that  the cloud may drop. O thou of face resembling the moon, the fierce and  maddening shafts of Manmatha whetted and sharpened by the desire of a  union with thee, piercing this heart of mine in their impetuous course,  have penetrated into its core. O black-eyed lady, those impetuous and  cruel shafts are maddening me beyond endurance. It behoveth thee to  relieve me from this plight by surrendering thyself to me and favouring  me with thy embraces. Decked in beautiful garlands and robes and adorned  with every ornament, sport thou, O sweet damsel, with me to thy fill. O  thou of the gait of an elephant in rut, deserving as thou art of  happiness though deprived of it now, it behoveth thee not to dwell here  in misery. Let unrivalled weal be thine. Drinking various kinds of  charming and delicious and ambrosial wines, and sporting at thy pleasure  in the enjoyment of diverse objects of delight, do thou, O blessed lady,  attain auspicious prosperity. This beauty of thine and this prime of thy  youth, O sweet lady, are now without their use. For, O beauteous and  chaste damsel, endued with such loveliness, thou dost not shine, like a  graceful garland lying unused and unworn. I will forsake all my old  wives. Let them, O thou of sweet smiles, become thy slaves. And I also,  O fair damsel, will stay by thee as thy slave, ever obedient to thee, O  thou of the most handsome face.' Hearing these words of his, Draupadi  replied, 'In desiring me, a female servant of low extraction, employed  in the despicable office of dressing hair, O _Suta's_ son, thou desirest  one that deserves not that honour. Then, again, I am the wife of others.  Therefore, good betide thee, this conduct of thine is not proper. Do  thou remember the precept of morality, viz., that persons should take  delight only in their wedded wives. Thou shouldst not, therefore, by any  means bend thy heart to adultery. Surely abstaining from improper acts  is ever the study of those that are good.

Raphael's spirit comes  forth from his grave in this noontide hour, and everything which its  reflection touches brightens into godlike splendor!\" The Princess  looked upon him tenderly, and he lightly laid his hand upon hers, and  said, as one vanquished, \"Sophocles!\"    On the next moonlit evening, Gaspard bespoke torches, in order that  the Coliseum, with its giant-circle, might the first time stand in  fire before them. The knight would fain have gone around alone with  his son, dimly through the dim work, like two spirits of the olden  time, but the Princess forced herself upon him, from a too lively wish  to share with the noble youth his great moments, and perhaps, in fact,  her heart and his own. Women do not sufficiently comprehend that an  idea, when it fills and elevates man's mind, shuts it, then, against  love, and crowds out persons; whereas with woman all ideas easily  become human beings.    They passed over the Forum, by the _Via Sacra_, to the Coliseum, whose  lofty, cloven forehead looked down pale under the moonlight. They  stood before the gray rock-walls, which reared themselves on four  colonnades one above another, and the torchlight shot up into the  arches of the arcades, gilding the green shrubbery high overhead, and  deep in the earth had the noble monster already buried his feet. They  stepped in and ascended the mountain, full of fragments of rock, from  one seat of the spectators to another. Gaspard did not venture to the  sixth or highest, where the men used to stand, but Albano and the  Princess did. Then the youth gazed down over the cliffs, upon the  round, green crater of the burnt-out volcano, which once swallowed  nine thousand beasts at once, and which quenched itself with human  blood. The lurid glare of the torches penetrated into the clefts and  caverns, and among the foliage of the ivy and laurel, and among the  great shadows of the moon, which, like departed spirits, hovered in  caverns. Toward the south, where the streams of centuries and  barbarians had stormed in, stood single columns and bare arcades.  Temples and three palaces had the giant fed and lined with his limbs,  and still, with all his wounds, he looked out livingly into the world.    \"What a people!\" said Albano. \"Here curled the giant snake five times  about Christianity. Like a smile of scorn lies the moonlight down  below there upon the green arena, where once stood the Colossus of the  Sun-god. The star of the north[9] glimmers low through the windows,  and the Serpent and the Bear crouch. What a world has gone by!\" The  Princess answered that \"twelve thousand prisoners built this theatre,  and that a great many more had bled therein.\" \"O! we too have  building prisoners,\" said he, \"but for fortifications; and blood, too,  still flows, but with sweat! No, we have no present; the past, without  it, must bring forth a future.\"    The Princess went to break a laurel-twig and pluck a blooming  wall-flower. Albano sank away into musing: the autumnal wind of the  past swept over the stubble. On this holy eminence he saw the  constellations, Rome's green hills, the glimmering city, the Pyramid  of Cestius; but all became Past, and on the twelve hills dwelt, as  upon graves, the lofty old spirits, and looked sternly into the age,  as if they were still its kings and judges.    \"This to remember the place and time!\" said the approaching Princess,  handing him the laurel and the flower. \"Thou mighty One! a Coliseum is  thy flower-pot; to thee is nothing too great, and nothing too small!\"  said he, and threw the Princess into considerable confusion, till she  observed that he meant not her, but nature. His whole being seemed  newly and painfully moved, and, as it were, removed to a distance: he  looked down after his father, and went to find him; he looked at him  sharply, and spoke of nothing more this evening.          THE OPENING OF THE WILL    From the _Flegeljahre_ (1804)    By JEAN PAUL    TRANSLATED BY FRANCES H. KING    Since Haslau had been a princely residence no one could remember any  event--the birth of the heir apparent excepted--that had been awaited  with such curiosity as the opening of the Van der Kabel will. Van der  Kabel might have been called the Haslau Croesus--and his life  described as a pleasure-making mint, or a washing of gold sand under a  golden rain, or in whatever other terms wit could devise. Now, seven  distant living relatives of seven distant deceased relatives of Kabel  were cherishing some hope of a legacy, because the Croesus had sworn  to remember them. These hopes, however, were very faint. No one was  especially inclined to trust him, as he not only conducted himself on  all occasions in a gruffly moral and unselfish manner--in regard to  morality, to be sure, the seven relatives were still beginners--but  likewise treated everything so derisively and possessed a heart so  full of tricks and surprises that there was no dependence to be placed  upon him. The eternal smile hovering around his temples and thick  lips, and the mocking falsetto voice, impaired the good impression  that might otherwise have been made by his nobly cut face and a pair  of large hands, from which New Year's presents, benefit performances,  and gratuities were continually falling. Wherefore the birds of  passage proclaimed the man, this human mountain-ash in which they  nested and of whose berries they ate, to be in reality a dangerous  trap; and they seemed hardly able to see the visible berries for the  invisible snares.    Between two attacks of apoplexy he made his will and deposited it with  the magistrate. Though half dead when, he gave over the certificate  to the seven presumptive heirs he said in his old tone of voice that  he did not wish this token of his decease to cause dejection to mature  men whom he would much rather think of as laughing than as weeping  heirs. And only one of them, the coldly ironical Police-Inspector  Harprecht, answered the smilingly ironical Croesus: \"It was not in  their power to determine the extent of their collective sympathy in  such a loss.\"    At last the seven heirs appeared with their certificate at the city  hall. These were the Consistorial Councilor Glanz, the Police  Inspector, the Court-Agent Neupeter, the Attorney of the Royal  Treasury Knol, the Bookseller Passvogel, the Preacher-at-Early-Service  Flachs, and Herr Flitte from Alsace. They duly and properly requested  of the magistrates the charter consigned to the latter by the late  Kabel, and asked for the opening of the will. The chief executor of  the will was the officiating Burgomaster in person, the  under-executors were the Municipal-Councilors. Presently the charter  and the will were fetched from the Council-chamber into the  Burgomaster's office, they were passed around to all the Councilors  and the heirs, in order that they might see the privy seal of the city  upon them, and the registry of the consignment written by the town  clerk upon the charter was read aloud to the seven heirs. Thereby it  was made known to them that the charter had really been consigned to  the magistrates by the late departed one and confided to them _scrinio  rei publicae_, likewise that he had been in his right mind on the day  of the consignment. The seven seals which he himself had placed upon  it were found to be intact. Then--after the Town-Clerk had again drawn  up a short record of all this--the will was opened in God's name and  read aloud by the officiating Burgomaster. It ran as follows:    \"I, Van der Kabel, do draw up my will on this seventh day of May 179-,  here in my house in Haslau, in Dog Street, without a great ado of  words, although I have been both a German notary and a Dutch _domine_.  Notwithstanding, I believe that I am still sufficiently familiar with  the notary's art to be able to act as a regular testator and  bequeather of property.    \"Testators are supposed to commence by setting forth the motives which  have caused them to make their will. These with me, as with most, are  my approaching death, and the disposal of an inheritance which is  desired by many. To talk about the funeral and such matters is too  weak and silly. That which remains of me, however, may the eternal sun  above us make use of for one of his verdant springs, not for a gloomy  winter!    \"The charitable bequests, about which notaries must always inquire, I  shall attend to by setting aside for three thousand of the city's  paupers an equal number of florins so that in the years to come, on  the anniversary of my death, if the annual review of the troops does  not happen to take place on the common that day, they can pitch their  camp there and have a merry feast off the money, and afterward clothe  themselves with the tent linen. To all the schoolmasters of our  Principality also I bequeath to every man one august d'or, and I leave  my pew in the Court church to the Jews of the city. My will being  divided into clauses, this may be taken as the first.    \"SECOND CLAUSE    It is the general custom for legacies and disinheritances to be  counted among the most essential parts of the will. In accordance with  this custom Consistorial Councillor Glanz, Attorney of the Royal  Treasury Knol, Court-Agent Peter Neupeter, Police-Inspector Harprecht,  the Preacher-at-Early-Service Flachs, the Court-bookseller Passvogel  and Herr Flitte, for the time being receive nothing; not so much  because no _Trebellianica_ is due them as the most distant relatives,  or because most of them have themselves enough to bequeath, as because  I know out of their own mouths that they love my insignificant person  better than my great wealth, which person I therefore leave them,  little as can be got out of it.\"    Seven preternaturally long faces at this point started up like the  Seven-sleepers. The Consistorial Councillor, a man still young but  celebrated throughout all Germany for "]]]
