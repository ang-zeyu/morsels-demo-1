What a complication for my divorce if he should surprise us in your  house!\"    Now it was he who eulogized the husband, insisting that such  watchfulness was incompatible with his character. The engineer had  accepted the facts, considering them irreparable and was now thinking  only of reconstructing his life.    \"No, it is better for us to separate,\" she continued. \"Tomorrow we shall  see each other again. You will hunt a more favorable place. Think it  over, and you will find a solution for it all.\"    But he wished an immediate solution. They had abandoned their seats,  going slowly toward the rue des Mathurins. Julio was speaking with a  trembling and persuasive eloquence. To-morrow? No, now. They had only to  call a taxicab. It would be only a matter of a few minutes, and then the  isolation, the mystery, the return to a sweet past--to that intimacy  in the studio where they had passed their happiest hours. They would  believe that no time had elapsed since their first meetings.    \"No,\" she faltered with a weakening accent, seeking a last resistance.  \"Besides, your secretary might be there, that Spaniard who lives with  you. How ashamed I would be to meet him again!\"    Julio laughed. . . . Argensola! How could that comrade who knew all  about their past be an obstacle? If they should happen to meet him in  the house, he would be sure to leave immediately. More than once, he had  had to go out so as not to be in the way. His discretion was such that  he had foreseen events. Probably he had already left, conjecturing that  a near visit would be the most logical thing. His chum would simply go  wandering through the streets in search of news.    Marguerite was silent, as though yielding on seeing her pretexts  exhausted. Desnoyers was silent, too, construing her stillness as  assent. They had left the garden and she was looking around uneasily,  terrified to find herself in the open street beside her lover, and  seeking a hiding-place. Suddenly she saw before her the little red door  of an automobile, opened by the hand of her adorer.    \"Get in,\" ordered Julio.    And she climbed in hastily, anxious to hide herself as soon as possible.  The vehicle started at great speed. Marguerite immediately pulled down  the shade of the window on her side, but, before she had finished and  could turn her head, she felt a hungry mouth kissing the nape of her  neck.    \"No, not here,\" she said in a pleading tone. \"Let us be sensible!\"    And while he, rebellious at these exhortations, persisted in his  advances, the voice of Marguerite again sounded above the noise of the  rattling machinery of the automobile as it bounded over the pavement.    \"Do you really believe that there will be no war? Do you believe that we  will be able to marry? . . . Tell me again. I want you to encourage me  . . . I need to hear it from your lips.\"        CHAPTER II    MADARIAGA, THE CENTAUR      In 1870 Marcelo Desnoyers was nineteen years old. He was born in the  suburbs of Paris, an only child; his father, interested in little  building speculations, maintained his family in modest comfort. The  mason wished to make an architect of his son, and Marcelo was in the  midst of his preparatory studies when his father suddenly died, leaving  his affairs greatly involved. In a few months, he and his mother  descended the slopes of ruin, and were obliged to give up their snug,  middle-class quarters and live like laborers.    When the fourteen-year-old boy had to choose a trade, he learned wood  carving. This craft was an art related to the tastes awakened in Marcelo  by his abandoned studies. His mother retired to the country, living with  some relatives while the lad advanced rapidly in the shops, aiding his  master in all the important orders which he received from the provinces.  The first news of the war with Prussia surprised him in Marseilles,  working on the decorations of a theatre.    Marcelo was opposed to the Empire like all the youths of his generation.  He was also much influenced by the older workmen who had taken part in  the Republic of '48, and who still retained vivid recollections of the  Coup d'Etat of the second of December.    One day he saw in the streets of Marseilles a popular manifestation in  favor of peace which was practically a protest against the government.  The old republicans in their implacable struggle with the Emperor, the  companies of the International which had just been organized, and a  great number of Italians and Spaniards who had fled their countries on  account of recent insurrections, composed the procession. A long-haired,  consumptive student was carrying the flag. \"It is peace that we want--a  peace which may unite all mankind,\" chanted the paraders. But on this  earth, the noblest propositions are seldom heard, since Destiny amuses  herself in perverting them and turning them aside.    Scarcely had the friends of peace entered the rue Cannebiere with their  hymn and standard, when war came to meet them, obliging them to resort  to fist and club. The day before, some battalions of Zouaves from  Algiers had disembarked in order to reinforce the army on the  frontier, and these veterans, accustomed to colonial existence and  undiscriminating as to the cause of disturbances, seized the opportunity  to intervene in this manifestation, some with bayonets and others with  ungirded belts. \"Hurrah for War!\" and a rain of lashes and blows  fell upon the unarmed singers. Marcelo saw the innocent student, the  standard-bearer of peace, knocked down wrapped in his flag, by the  merry kicks of the Zouaves. Then he knew no more, since he had received  various blows with a leather strap, and a knife thrust in his shoulder;  he had to run the same as the others.    That day developed for the first time, his fiery, stubborn character,  irritable before contradiction, even to the point of adopting the most  extreme resolution. \"Down with War!\" Since it was not possible for him  to protest in any other way, he would leave the country. The Emperor  might arrange his affairs as best he could. The struggle was going to  be long and disastrous, according to the enemies of the Empire. If he  stayed, he would in a few months be drawn for the soldiery. Desnoyers  renounced the honor of serving the Emperor. He hesitated a little when  he thought of his mother. But his country relatives would not turn her  out, and he planned to work very hard and send her money. Who knew what  riches might be waiting for him, on the other side of the sea! . . .  Good-bye, France!    Thanks to his savings, a harbor official found it to his interest to  offer him the choice of three boats. One was sailing to Egypt, another  to Australia, another to Montevideo and Buenos Aires, which made the  strongest appeal to him? . . . Desnoyers, remembering his readings,  wished to consult the wind and follow the course that it indicated, as  he had seen various heroes of novels do. But that day the wind blew from  the sea toward France. He also wished to toss up a coin in order to test  his fate. Finally he decided upon the vessel sailing first. Not until,  with his scanty baggage, he was actually on the deck of the next boat  to anchor, did he take any interest in its course--\"For the Rio de la  Plata.\" . . . And he accepted these words with a fatalistic shrug. \"Very  well, let it be South America!\" The country was not distasteful to him,  since he knew it by certain travel publications whose illustrations  represented herds of cattle at liberty, half-naked, plumed Indians, and  hairy cowboys whirling over their heads serpentine lassos tipped with  balls.    The millionaire Desnoyers never forgot that trip to America--forty-three  days navigating in a little worn-out steamer that rattled like a heap  of old iron, groaned in all its joints at the slightest roughness of the  sea, and had to stop four times for repairs, at the mercy of the winds  and waves.    In Montevideo, he learned of the reverses suffered by his country and  that the French Empire no longer existed. He felt a little ashamed  when he heard that the nation was now self-governing, defending itself  gallantly behind the walls of Paris. And he had fled! . . . Months  afterwards, the events of the Commune consoled him for his flight. If  he had remained, wrath at the national downfall, his relations with his  co-laborers, the air in which he lived--everything would surely have  dragged him along to revolt. In that case, he would have been shot or  consigned to a colonial prison like so many of his former comrades.    So his determination crystallized, and he stopped thinking about the  affairs of his mother-country. The necessities of existence in a foreign  land whose language he was beginning to pick up made him think only  of himself. The turbulent and adventurous life of these new nations  compelled him to most absurd expedients and varied occupations. Yet he  felt himself strong with an audacity and self-reliance which he never  had in the old world. \"I am equal to everything,\" he said, \"if they  only give me time to prove it!\" Although he had fled from his country  in order not to take up arms, he even led a soldier's life for a  brief period in his adopted land, receiving a wound in one of the many  hostilities between the whites and reds in the unsettled districts.    In Buenos Aires, he again worked as a woodcarver. The city was beginning  to expand, breaking its shell as a large village. Desnoyers spent many  years ornamenting salons and facades. It was a laborious existence,  sedentary and remunerative. But one day he became tired of this slow  saving which could only bring him a mediocre fortune after a long time.  He had gone to the new world to become rich like so many others. And  at twenty-seven, he started forth again, a full-fledged adventurer,  avoiding the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14866"],[0,"Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#7)"],[1,"panoramic point of view. The sea and sky are everywhere the same  primeval elements. But no other country has so much primeval land to  match them. Labrador is a miracle of youth and age combined. It is  still growing out of the depths with the irresistible vigour of youth.  But its titanic tablelands consist of those azoic rocks which form the  very roots of all the other mountains in the world, and which are so  old, so immeasurably older than any others now standing on the surface  of the globe, that their Laurentians alone have the real right to bear  the title of \"The Everlasting Hills\". Being azoic these Laurentians  are older than the first age when our remotest ancestors appeared in  the earliest of animal forms, millions and millions of years ago.  They are, in fact, the only part of the visible Earth which was  present when Life itself was born. So here are the three great  elemental characters, all together--the primal sea and sky and  land--to act the azoic prologue. And here, too, for all mankind to  glory in, is the whole pageant of animal life: from the weakest  invertebrate forms, which link us with the illimitable past, to the  mightiest developments of birds and mammals at the present day, the  leviathan whales around us, the soaring eagles overhead, and man  himself--the culmination of them all--and especially migrating man,  whose incoming myriads are linking us already with the most pregnant  phases of the future. Where else are there so many intimate appeals  both to the child and the philosopher? Where else, in all this world,  are there any parts of the Creation more fit to exalt our visions and  make us \"Look, through Nature, up to Nature's God\"?    But, Sir, I must stop here; and not without renewed apologies for  having detained you so long over a question on which, as I have  already warned you, I do not profess to be a scientific expert. I fear  I have been no architect, not even a builder. But perhaps I have done  a hodman's work, by bringing a little mortar, with which some of the  nobler materials may presently be put together.          Bibliography      This short list is a mere indication of what can be found in any good  library.    General information is given in _Labrador; its Discovery, Exploration  and Development--By W.G. Gosling: Toronto, Musson._ The Atlantic  Labrador is dealt with by competent experts in _Labrador: the Country  and the People--By W.T. Grenfell and Others: New York, The Macmillan  Company, 1910._ This has several valuable chapters on the fauna. The  Peninsula generally, the interior especially, and the fauna  incidentally, are dealt with in the reports of _A.P. Low_ and _D.I.V.  Eaton_ to the _Geological Survey of Canada, 1893-4-5._ An excellent  general paper on the country is _The Labrador Peninsula, By Robert  Bell_, in _The Scottish Geographical Magazine_ for July, 1895. The N.  of the S.W. part is more particularly described in his _Recent  Explorations to the South of Hudson Bay_ in _The Geographical Journal_  for July, 1897. The Quebec Labrador is the subject of a recent  Provincial report, _La Cote Nord du Saint Laurent et le Labrador  Canadien--Par Eugene Rouillard: Quebec, 1908--Ministere de la  Colonisation, des Mines et des Pecheries._ An excellent account of  animal life on the W. half of the Quebec Labrador is to be found in  _Life and Sport on the North Shore--By Napoleon A. Comeau: Quebec,  1909._ The zoology of the Mammals, though not particularly in their  Labrador habitat, is to be found in _Life-Histories of Northern  Mammals--By Ernest Thompson-Seton: London, Constable, 2 Vols., 1910._  The birds, similarly, in the _Catalogue of Canadian Birds--By John  Macoun and James M. Macoun: Ottawa, Government Printing Bureau, 1909._  Some books about adjacent areas may be profitably consulted, like  _Newfoundland and its Untrodden Ways--By John Guille Millais,_ and  American official publications, like the _Birds of New York--By Elon  Howard Eaton: Albany, University of the State of New York, 1910._ No.  34 of the _New York Zoological Society Bulletin_--for June, 1909--is a  \"Wild-life Preservation Number.\" The best general history and  present-day summary of the world's fur trade is to be found in a  recent German work, a genuine _Urquellengeschichte._ French and  English translations will presumably appear in due course. The  statistical tables are wonderfully complete. The illustrations are the  least satisfactory feature. This book is--_Aus dem Reiche der Pelze.
