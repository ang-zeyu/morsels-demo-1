Auer really has a wonderful  intellect, and some secrets well worth knowing. That he is so great an  artist himself on the instrument is the more remarkable, since  physically he was not exceptionally favored. Often, when he saw me, he'd  say with a sigh: 'Ah, if I only had your hand!'    \"Auer was a great virtuoso player. He held a unique place in the  Imperial Ballet. You know in many of the celebrated ballets,  Tschaikovsky's for instance, there occur beautiful and difficult solos  for the violin. They call for an artist of the first rank, and Auer was  accustomed to play them in Petrograd. In Russia it was considered a  decided honor to be called upon to play one of those ballet solos; but  in London it was looked on as something quite incidental. I remember  when Diaghilev presented Tschaikovsky's _Lac des Cygnes_ in London, the  Grand-Duke Andrew Vladimirev (who had heard me play), an amiable young  boy, and a patron of the arts, requested me--and at that time the  request of a Romanov was still equivalent to a command--to play the  violin solos which accompany the love scenes. It was not exactly easy,  since I had to play and watch dancers and conductor at the same time.  Yet it was a novelty for London, however; everybody was pleased and the  Grand-Duke presented me with a handsome diamond pin as an  acknowledgment.                                  VIOLIN MASTERY    \"You ask me what I understand by 'Violin Mastery'? Well, it seems to me  that the artist who can present anything he plays as a distinct  picture, in every detail, framing the composer's idea in the perfect  beauty of his plastic rendering, with absolute truth of color and  proportion--he is the artist who deserves to be called a master!    \"Of course, the instrument the artist uses is an important factor in  making it possible for him to do his best. My violin? It is an authentic  Strad--dated 1722. I bought it of Willy Burmester in London. You see he  did not care much for it. The German style of playing is not calculated  to bring out the tone beauty, the quality of the old Italian fiddles. I  think Burmester had forced the tone, and it took me some time to make it  mellow and truly responsive again, but now....\" Mr. Elman beamed. It was  evident he was satisfied with his instrument. \"As to strings,\" he  continued, \"I never use wire strings--they have no color, no quality!                               WHAT TO STUDY AND HOW    \"For the advanced student there is a wealth of study material. No one  ever wrote more beautiful violin music than Haendel, so rich in  invention, in harmonic fullness. In Beethoven there are more ideas than  tone--but such ideas! Schubert--all genuine, spontaneous! Bach is so  gigantic that the violin often seems inadequate to express him. That is  one reason why I do not play more Bach in public.    \"The study of a sonata or concerto should entirely absorb the attention  of the student to such a degree that, as he is able to play it, it has  become a part of him. He should be able to play it as though it were an  improvisation--of course without doing violence to the composer's idea.  If he masters the composition in the way it should be mastered it  becomes a portion of himself. Before I even take up my violin I study a  piece thoroughly in score. I read and reread it until I am at home with  the composer's thought, and its musical balance and proportion. Then,  when I begin to play it, its salient points are already memorized, and  the practicing gives me a kind of photographic reflex of detail. After I  have not played a number for a long time it fades from my memory--like  an old negative--but I need only go over it once or twice to have a  clear mnemonic picture of it once more.    \"Yes, I believe in transcriptions for the violin--with certain  provisos,\" said Mr. Elman, in reply to another question. \"First of all  the music to be transcribed must lend itself naturally to the  instrument. Almost any really good melodic line, especially a  _cantilena_, will sound with a fitting harmonic development. Violinists  of former days like Spohr, Rode and Paganini were more intent on  composing music _out of the violin_! The modern idea lays stress first  of all on the _idea_ in music. In transcribing I try to forget I am a  violinist, in order to form a perfect picture of the musical idea--its  violinistic development must be a natural, subconscious working-out. If  you will look at some of my recent transcripts--the Albaniz _Tango_, the  negro melody _Deep River_ and Amani's fine _Orientale_--you will see  what I mean. They are conceived as pictures--I have not tried to analyze  too much--and while so conceiving them their free harmonic background  shapes itself for me without strain or effort.                             A REMINISCENCE OF COLONNE    \"Conductors with whom I have played? There are many: Hans Richter, who  was a master of the baton; Nikisch, one of the greatest in conducting  the orchestral accompaniment to a violin solo number; Colonne of Paris,  and many others. I had an amusing experience with Colonne once. He  brought his orchestra to Russia while I was with Auer, and was giving a  concert at Pavlovsk, a summer resort near Petrograd. Colonne had a  perfect horror of 'infant prodigies,' and Auer had arranged for me to  play with his orchestra without telling him my age--I was eleven at the  time. When Colonne saw me, violin in hand, ready to step on the stage,  he drew himself up and said with emphasis: 'I play with a prodigy!  Never!' Nothing could move him, and I had to play to a piano  accompaniment. After he had heard me play, though, he came over to me  and said: 'The best apology I can make for what I said is to ask you to  do me the honor of playing with the _Orchestre Colonne_ in Paris.' He  was as good as his word. Four months later I went to Paris and played  the Mendelssohn concerto for him with great success.\"                                             V                                   SAMUEL GARDNER                            TECHNIC AND MUSICIANSHIP      Samuel Gardner, though born in Jelisavetgrad, Cherson province, in  Southern Russia, in 1891, is to all intents and purposes an American,  since his family, fleeing the tyranny of an Imperialistic regime of  \"pogroms\" and \"Black Hundreds,\" brought him to this country when a mere  child; and here in the United States he has become, to quote Richard  Aldrich, \"the serious and accomplished artist,\" whose work on the  concert stage has given such pleasure to lovers of violin music at its  best. The young violinist, who in the course of the same week had just  won two prizes in composition--the Pulitzer Prize (Columbia) for a  string quartet, and the Loeb Prize for a symphonic poem--was amiably  willing to talk of his study experience for the benefit of other  students.             CHARLES MARTIN LOEFFLER AND FELIX WINTERNITZ AS TEACHERS    \"I took up the study of the violin at the age of seven, and when I was  nine I went to Charles Martin Loeffler and really began to work  seriously. Loeffler was a very strict teacher and very exacting, but he  achieved results, for he had a most original way of making his points  clear to the student. He started off with the Sevcik studies, laying  great stress on the proper finger articulation. And he taught me  absolute smoothness in change of position when crossing the strings. For  instance, in the second book of Sevcik's 'Technical Exercises,' in the  third exercise, the bow crosses from G to A, and from D to E, leaving a  string between in each crossing. Well, I simply could not manage to get  to the second string to be played without the string in between  sounding! Loeffler showed me what every good fiddler _must_ learn to do:  to leap from the end of the down-bow to the up-bow and _vice versa_ and  then hesitate the fraction of a moment, thus securing a smooth,  clean-cut tone, without any vibration of the intermediate string.  Loeffler never gave a pupil any rest until he came up to his  requirements. I know when I played the seventh and eighth Kreutzer  studies for him--they are trill studies--he said: 'You trill like an  electric bell, but not fast enough!' And he kept at me to speed up my  tempo without loss of clearness or tone-volume, until I could do justice  to a rapid trill. It is a great quality in a teacher to be literally  able to _enforce_ the pupil's progress in certain directions; for though  the latter may not appreciate it at the time, later on he is sure to do  so. I remember once when he was trying to explain the perfect  _crescendo_ to me, fire-engine bells began to ring in the distance, the  sound gradually drawing nearer the house in Charles Street where I was  taking my lesson. 'There you have it!' Loeffler cried: 'There's your  ideal _crescendo_! Play it like that and I will be satisfied!' I  remained with Loeffler a year and a half, and when he went to Paris  began to study with Felix Winternitz.    \"Felix Winternitz was a teacher who allowed his pupils to develop  individuality. 'I care nothing for theories,' he used to say, 'so long  as I can see something original in your work!' He attached little  importance to the theory of technic, but a great deal to technical  development along individual lines. And he always encouraged me to  express myself freely, within my limitations, stressing the musical side  of my work. With him I played through the concertos which, after a time,  I used for technical material, since every phase of technic and bowing  is covered in these great works. I was only fifteen when I left  Winternitz and still played by instinct rather than intellectually. I  still used my bow arm somewhat stiffly, and did not think much about  phrasing. I instinctively phrased whatever the music itself made clear  to me, and what I did not understand I merely played.

Peter Paul Rubens was of a distinguished family at _Antwerp_; but  his father being (says Pilkington) under the necessity of quitting his  country, to avoid the calamities attendant on a civil war, retired for  security to Cologne; and during his residence in that city Rubens was  born, in 1577. The day of his nativity was the Feast of St. Peter and  St. Paul; and thence he received at the baptismal font the names of  these apostles.    Having been absent from his native country eight years, he was summoned  home by the repeated illness of his mother; but, though he hastened with  all speed, he did not reach Antwerp in time to afford his beloved parent  the consolations of his presence and affections. The loss of her  affected him deeply; and he intended, when he had arranged his private  affairs, to go and reside in Italy; but the Archduke Albert and the  Infanta Isabella exerted their interest to retain him in Flanders, and  in their service. He consequently established himself at Antwerp, where  he married his first wife, Elizabeth Brants, and built a magnificent  house, with a saloon in form of a rotunda, which he enriched with  antique statues, busts, vases, and pictures, by the most celebrated  masters; and here, surrounded by works of art, he carried, (says his  biographer,) into execution those numberless productions of his prolific  and rich invention, which once adorned his native country, but now are  become the spoil of war, and the tokens of conquest and ambition,  shining with equal lustre among super-eminent productions of painting in  the gallery of the Louvre.    The whole of the paintings, except two, which adorn the gallery of the  Luxembourg, were executed at Antwerp, by Rubens, for Mary de Medici.    He died in the year 1640, at the age of 63; and was buried, with  extraordinary pomp, in the church of St. James, at Antwerp, under the  altar of his private chapel, which he had previously decorated with a  very fine picture.

(_Abridged from Tom Cringle's Log, in Blackwood's Magazine._)      During the night we stood off and on under easy sail, and next morning,  when the day broke, with a strong breeze and a fresh shower, we were  about two miles of the Moro Castle, at the entrance of Santiago de Cuba.    The fresh green shores of this glorious island lay before us, fringed  with white surf, as the everlasting ocean in its approach to it  gradually changed its dark blue colour, as the water shoaled, into a  bright, joyous green under the blazing sun, as if in sympathy with the  genius of the fair land, before it tumbled at his feet its gently  swelling billows, in shaking thunders on the reefs and rocky face of the  coast, against which they were driven up in clouds, the incense of their  sacrifice. The undulating hills in the vicinity were all either cleared,  and covered with the greenest verdure that imagination can picture, over  which strayed large herds of cattle, or with forests of gigantic trees,  from amongst which, every now and then, peeped out some palm-thatched  mountain settlement, with its small thread of blue smoke floating up  into the calm, clear morning air, while the blue hills in the distance  rose higher and higher, and more and more blue, and dreamy, and  indistinct, until their rugged summits could not be distinguished from  the clouds through the glimmering hot haze of the tropics.    A very melancholy accident happened to a poor boy on board, of about  fifteen years of age, who had already become a great favourite of mine  from his modest, quiet deportment, as well as of all the  gunroom-officers, although he had not been above a fortnight in the  ship. He had let himself down over the bows by the cable to bathe. There  were several of his comrades standing on the forecastle looking at him,  and he asked one of them to go out on the spritsail-yard, and look  round to see if there were any sharks in the neighbourhood; but all  around was deep, clear, green water. He kept hold of the cable, however,  and seemed determined not to put himself in harm's way, until a little,  wicked urchin, who used to wait on the warrant-officers' mess, a small  meddling snipe of a creature, who got flogged in well behaved weeks  _only_ once, began to taunt my little mild favourite.    \"Why, you chicken-heart, I'll wager a thimbleful of grog, that such a  tailor as you are in the water can't for the life of you swim but to the  buoy there.\"    \"Never you mind, Pepperbottom,\" said the boy, giving the imp the name he  had richly earned by repeated flagellations. \"Never you mind. I am not  ashamed to show my naked hide, you know. But it is against orders in  these seas to go overboard, unless with a sail underfoot; so I sha'n't  run the risk of being tatooed by the boatswain's mate, like some one I  could tell of.\"    \"Coward,\" muttered the little wasp, \"you are afraid, sir;\" and the other  boys abetting the mischief-maker, the lad was goaded to leave his hold  of the cable, and strike out for the buoy. He reached it, and then  turned, and pulled towards the ship again, when he caught my eye.    \"Who is that overboard? How dare you, sir, disobey the standing order of  the ship? Come in, boy; come in.\"    My hailing the little fellow shoved him off his balance, and he lost his  presence of mind for a moment or two, during which he, if any thing,  widened his distance from the ship.    At this instant the lad on the spritsail-yard sung out quick and  suddenly, \"A shark, a shark!\"    And the monster, like a silver pillar, suddenly shot up perpendicularly  from out the dark green depths of the sleeping pool, with the waters  sparkling and hissing around him, as if he had been a sea-demon rushing  on his prey.    \"Pull for the cable, Louis,\" shouted fifty voices at once--\"pull for the  cable.\"    The boy did so--we all ran forward. He reached the cable--grasped it  with both hands, and hung on, but before he could swing himself out of  the water, the fierce fish had turned. His whitish-green belly "]]]
