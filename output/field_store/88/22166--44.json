These facts are on official record in Germany, where the proclamation  summing up Wagner as \"a politically dangerous person\" may be consulted  to this day. The pamphlets are now accessible to English readers in the  translation of Mr. Ashton Ellis. This being so, any person who, having  perhaps heard that I am a Socialist, attempts to persuade you that my  interpretation of The Rhine Gold is only \"my socialism\" read into the  works of a dilettantist who borrowed an idle tale from an old saga to  make an opera book with, may safely be dismissed from your consideration  as an ignoramus.    If you are now satisfied that The Rhine Gold is an allegory, do not  forget that an allegory is never quite consistent except when it  is written by someone without dramatic faculty, in which case it is  unreadable. There is only one way of dramatizing an idea; and that is by  putting on the stage a human being possessed by that idea, yet none the  less a human being with all the human impulses which make him akin and  therefore interesting to us. Bunyan, in his Pilgrim's Progress, does  not, like his unread imitators, attempt to personify Christianity and  Valour: he dramatizes for you the life of the Christian and the Valiant  Man. Just so, though I have shown that Wotan is Godhead and Kingship,  and Loki Logic and Imagination without living Will (Brain without Heart,  to put it vulgarly); yet in the drama Wotan is a religiously moral man,  and Loki a witty, ingenious, imaginative and cynical one. As to Fricka,  who stands for State Law, she does not assume her allegorical character  in The Rhine Gold at all, but is simply Wotan's wife and Freia's sister:  nay, she contradicts her allegorical self by conniving at all Wotan's  rogueries. That, of course, is just what State Law would do; but we must  not save the credit of the allegory by a quip. Not until she reappears  in the next play (The Valkyries) does her function in the allegorical  scheme become plain.    One preconception will bewilder the spectator hopelessly unless he  has been warned against it or is naturally free from it. In the  old-fashioned orders of creation, the supernatural personages are  invariably conceived as greater than man, for good or evil. In the  modern humanitarian order as adopted by Wagner, Man is the highest.  In The Rhine Gold, it is pretended that there are as yet no men on the  earth. There are dwarfs, giants, and gods. The danger is that you will  jump to the conclusion that the gods, at least, are a higher order than  the human order. On the contrary, the world is waiting for Man to redeem  it from the lame and cramped government of the gods. Once grasp that;  and the allegory becomes simple enough. Really, of course, the dwarfs,  giants, and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to  wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient,  toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the  intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States  and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of  these: namely, the order of Heroes.    Now it is quite clear--though you have perhaps never thought of it--that  if the next generation of Englishmen consisted wholly of Julius Caesars,  all our political, ecclesiastical, and moral institutions would  vanish, and the less perishable of their appurtenances be classed with  Stonehenge and the cromlechs and round towers as inexplicable relics of  a bygone social order. Julius Caesars would no more trouble themselves  about such contrivances as our codes and churches than a fellow of the  Royal Society will touch his hat to the squire and listen to the village  curate's sermons. This is precisely what must happen some day if life  continues thrusting towards higher and higher organization as it has  hitherto done. As most of our English professional men are to Australian  bushmen, so, we must suppose, will the average man of some future day  be to Julius Caesar. Let any man of middle age, pondering this prospect  consider what has happened within a single generation to the articles  of faith his father regarded as eternal nay, to the very scepticisms and  blasphemies of his youth (Bishop Colenso's criticism of the Pentateuch,  for example!); and he will begin to realize how much of our barbarous  Theology and Law the man of the future will do without. Bakoonin, the  Dresden revolutionary leader with whom Wagner went out in 1849, put  forward later on a program, often quoted with foolish horror, for  the abolition of all institutions, religious, political, juridical,  financial, legal, academic, and so on, so as to leave the will of man  free to find its own way. All the loftiest spirits of that time were  burning to raise Man up, to give him self-respect, to shake him out  of his habit of grovelling before the ideals created by his own  imagination, of attributing the good that sprang from the ceaseless  energy of the life within himself to some superior power in the clouds,  and of making a fetish of self-sacrifice to justify his own cowardice.    Farther on in The Ring we shall see the Hero arrive and make an end  of dwarfs, giants, and gods. Meanwhile, let us not forget that godhood  means to Wagner infirmity and compromise, and manhood strength and  integrity. Above all, we must understand--for it is the key to much that  we are to see--that the god, since his desire is toward a higher and  fuller life, must long in his inmost soul for the advent of that greater  power whose first work, though this he does not see as yet, must be his  own undoing.    In the midst of all these far-reaching ideas, it is amusing to find  Wagner still full of his ingrained theatrical professionalism, and  introducing effects which now seem old-fashioned and stagey with as much  energy and earnestness as if they were his loftiest inspirations. When  Wotan wrests the ring from Alberic, the dwarf delivers a lurid and  bloodcurdling stage curse, calling down on its every future possessor  care, fear, and death. The musical phrase accompanying this outburst was  a veritable harmonic and melodic bogey to mid-century ears, though time  has now robbed it of its terrors. It sounds again when Fafnir slays  Fasolt, and on every subsequent occasion when the ring brings death to  its holder. This episode must justify itself purely as a piece of stage  sensationalism. On deeper ground it is superfluous and confusing, as the  ruin to which the pursuit of riches leads needs no curse to explain it;  nor is there any sense in investing Alberic with providential powers in  the matter.          THE VALKYRIES    Before the curtain rises on the Valkyries, let us see what has happened  since it fell on The Rhine Gold. The persons of the drama will tell us  presently; but as we probably do not understand German, that may not  help us.    Wotan is still ruling the world in glory from his giant-built castle  with his wife Fricka. But he has no security for the continuance of his  reign, since Alberic may at any moment contrive to recover the ring,  the full power of which he can wield because he has forsworn love. Such  forswearing is not possible to Wotan: love, though not his highest need,  is a higher than gold: otherwise he would be no god. Besides, as we have  seen, his power has been established in the world by and as a system  of laws enforced by penalties. These he must consent to be bound by  himself; for a god who broke his own laws would betray the fact that  legality and conformity are not the highest rule of conduct--a discovery  fatal to his supremacy as Pontiff and Lawgiver. Hence he may not wrest  the ring unlawfully from Fafnir, even if he could bring himself to  forswear love.    In this insecurity he has hit on the idea of forming a heroic bodyguard.  He has trained his love children as war-maidens (Valkyries) whose duty  it is to sweep through battle-fields and bear away to Valhalla the souls  of the bravest who fall there. Thus reinforced by a host of warriors,  he has thoroughly indoctrinated them, Loki helping him as  dialectician-in-chief, with the conventional system of law and duty,  supernatural religion and self-sacrificing idealism, which they believe  to be the essence of his godhood, but which is really only the machinery  of the love of necessary power which is his mortal weakness. This  process secures their fanatical devotion to his system of government,  but he knows perfectly well that such systems, in spite of their moral  pretensions, serve selfish and ambitious tyrants better than benevolent  despots, and that, if once Alberic gets the ring back, he will easily  out-Valhalla Valhalla, if not buy it over as a going concern. The only  chance of permanent security, then, is the appearance in the world of a  hero who, without any illicit prompting from Wotan, will destroy Alberic  and wrest the ring from Fafnir. There will then, he believes, be no  further cause for anxiety, since he does not yet conceive Heroism as  a force hostile to Godhead. In his longing for a rescuer, it does not  occur to him that when the Hero comes, his first exploit must be to  sweep the gods and their ordinances from the path of the heroic will.    Indeed, he feels that in his own Godhead is the germ of such Heroism,  and that from himself the Hero must spring. He takes to wandering,  mostly in search of love, from Fricka and Valhalla. He seeks the First  Mother; and through her womb, eternally fertile, the inner true thought  that made him first a god is reborn as his daughter, uncorrupted by his  ambition, unfettered by his machinery of power and his alliances with  Fricka and Loki. This daughter, the Valkyrie Brynhild, is his true will,  his real self, (as he thinks): to her he may say what he must not say to  anyone, since in speaking to her he but speaks to himself. \"Was Keinem  in Worten unausgesprochen,\" he says to her, \"bl"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#7)"],[1,"about the excited couple, every one on  deck hurrying to the spot, eager to learn the cause of the tumult of joy  and grief into which the two seemed to have been so suddenly thrown.    Mr. Dinsmore rose, and giving his arm to Elsie, led her towards the  throng, saying in answer to her last remark, \"Better act through me, then,  daughter, or you will probably be asked two or three prices.\"    \"O papa, yes; please attend to it for me--only--only I must have him, for  dear old mammy's sake, at whatever cost.\"    The crowd opened to the lady and gentleman as they drew near.    \"My poor old mammy, what is it? whom have you found?\" asked Elsie.    But Chloe was speechless with a joy so deep that it wore the aspect of an  almost heart-breaking sorrow. She could only cling with choking sobs to  her husband's arm. \"What's all this fuss, Uncle Joe?\" queried the captain.  \"Let go the old darkie; what's she to you?\"    \"My wife, sah, dat I ain't seed for twenty years, sah,\" replied the old  man, trying to steady his trembling tones, obeying the order, but making  no effort to shake off Chloe's clinging hold.    \"Leave him for a little now, mammy dear; you shall never be parted again,\"  whispered Elsie in her nurse's ear. \"Come with me, and let papa talk to  the captain.\"    Chloe obeyed, silently following her young mistress to the other side of  the deck, but ever and anon turning her head to look back with wet eyes at  the old wrinkled black face and white beard that to her were so dear, so  charming. His eyes were following her with a look of longing, yearning  affection, and involuntarily he stretched out his arms towards her.    \"Off to your work, sir,\" ordered the captain, \"and let's have no more of  this nonsense.\"    Old Joe moved away with a patient sigh.    \"The woman is your property, I presume, sir?\" the captain remarked in a  respectful tone, addressing Mr. Dinsmore.    \"Yes, my daughter's, which amounts to the same thing,\" that gentleman  replied in a tone of indifference; then changing the subject, made some  inquiries about the speed and safety of the boat, the length of her trips,  etc.    The captain answered pleasantly, showing pride in his vessel. Then they  spoke of other things: the country, the crops, the weather.    \"Sit down, mammy,\" said Elsie pityingly, as they reached the settee where  she and her father had been sitting; \"you are trembling so you can  scarcely stand.\"    \"O darlin', dat's true 'nuff, I'se mos' ready to drop,\" she said  tremulously, coming down heavily upon a trunk that stood close at hand.  \"Oh, de good Lord hab bring me face to face wid my ole Uncle Joe; oh, I  neber 'spected to see him no more in dis wicked world. But dey'll take 'im  off again an' dis ole heart'll break,\" she added, with a bursting sob.    \"No, no, mammy, you shall have him, if money can accomplish it.\"    \"You buy 'im, darlin'? Oh, your ole mammy can neber t'ank you 'nuff!\" and  a low, happy laugh mingled with the choking sobs. \"But dey'll ask heaps ob  money.\"    \"You shall have him, let the price be what it will,\" was Elsie's  assurance. \"See papa is bargaining with the captain now, for they look at  Uncle Joe as they talk.\"    Chloe regarded them with eager interest; yes, they were looking at Uncle  Joe, and evidently speaking of him.    \"By the way,\" Mr. Dinsmore remarked carelessly, \"does Uncle Joe belong to  you? or is he merely a hired hand?\"    \"He's my property, sir.\"    \"Would you like to sell?\"    \"I am not anxious; he's a good hand, faithful and honest: quite a  religious character in fact,\" he concluded with a sneer; \"overshoots the  mark in prayin and psalm-singing. But do you want to buy?\"    \"Well yes; my daughter is fond of her old mammy, and for her sake would be  willing to give a reasonable sum. What do you ask?\"    \"Make me an offer.\"    \"Five hundred dollars.\"    \"Five hundred? ridiculous! he's worth twice that.\"    \"I think not, he is old--not far from seventy and will soon be past work  and only a burden and expense. My offer is a good one.\"    \"Make it seven hundred and I'll take it.\"    Mr. Dinsmore considered a moment. \"That is too high,\" he said at length,  \"but for the sake of making two poor creatures happy, I will give it.\"    \"Cash down?\"    \"Yes, a check on a New Orleans bank.\"    \"Please walk down into the cabin then, sir, and we'll conclude the  business at once.\"    In a few moments Mr. Dinsmore returned to his daughter's side, and placing  the receipted bill of sale in her hands, asked, \"Have I given too much?\"    \"Oh, no, papa, no indeed! I should have given a thousand without a  moment's hesitation, if asked it--five, ten thousand, if need be, rather  than have them parted again,\" she exclaimed, the bright tears shining in  her eyes. \"Mammy, my poor old mammy, Uncle Joe belongs to me now, and you  can have him always with you as long as the Lord spares your lives.\"    \"Now bress de Lord!\" cried the old woman devoutly, raising her streaming  eyes and clasped hands to heaven; \"de good Lord dat hears de prayers ob  His chilen's cryin' to Him when dere hearts is oberwhelmed!\"    \"Go break the news to Uncle Joe, mammy,\" said Elsie; \"see, yonder he  stands looking so eager and wistful.\"    Chloe hurried to his side, spoke a few rapid words; there was another  long, clinging, tearful embrace, and they hastened to their master and  mistress to pour out their thanks and blessings upon them, mingled with  praises and fervent thanksgivings to the Giver of all good.    The joy and gratitude of the poor old couple were very sweet, very  delightful to Elsie, and scarcely less so to her father.    \"Mammy dear, I never saw you wear so happy a face,\" Elsie said, as Chloe  returned to her after an hour or two spent in close conversation with her  newly recovered spouse.    \"Ah, honey, your ole mammy tinks she neber so glad in all her life!\" cried  the poor old creature, clasping her hands together in an ecstasy of joy  and gratitude while the big tears shone in her eyes. \"I'se got ole Uncle  Joe back agin, an' he not de same, he bettah man, Christian man. He say,  'Aunt Chloe we uns trabble de same road now, honey: young Joe proud,  angry, swearing drinkin' boy, your Ole Joe he lub de Lord an' try to sarve  Him wid all he might. And de Lord good Massa. De debbil berry bad one.'\"    \"Dear mammy, I am very glad for you; I think nothing else could have made  you so happy.\"    Chloe, weeping again for joy, went on to tell her young mistress that  Uncle Joe had discovered a grandchild in New Orleans, Dinah by name,  waiting-maid in a wealthy family.    \"But how is that, mammy? Papa and I thought all your children died young.\"    \"No, darlin', when Massa Grayson buy me in New Orleans, an' de odder  gentleman buy Uncle Joe, we hab little girl four years ole, an' de ole  missus keep her,\" sobbed Chloe, living over again the agony of the  parting, \"an' Dinah her chile.\"    \"Mammy, if money will buy her, you shall have her, too,\" said Elsie  earnestly.    The remainder of the short voyage was a happy time to the whole of our  little party, Chloe, with her restored husband by her side, now looking  forward to the visit to Viamede with almost unmingled pleasure.    As they passed up the bay, entered Teche Bayou and pressed on, threading  their way through lake and lakelet, past plain and forest, plantation and  swamp, Elsie exclaimed again and again at the beauty of the scenery. Cool  shady dells carpeted with the rich growth of flowers, miles upon miles of  lawns as smoothly shaven, as velvety green and as nobly shaded by  magnificent oaks and magnolias, as any king's demesne; lordly villas  peering through groves of orange trees, tall white, sugar-houses and the  long rows of cabins of the laborers; united to form a panorama of  surpassing loveliness.    \"Is Viamede as lovely as that, papa?\" Elsie would ask, as they steamed  past one fine residence after another.    \"Quite,\" he would reply with a smile, at length adding, \"There is not a  more beautiful or valuable estate in the country; as you may judge for  yourself, for this is it.\"    \"This, papa? Oh it is lovely, lovely! and everything in such perfect  order,\" she cried delightedly as they swept on past a large sugar-house  and an immense orange orchard, whose golden fruit and glossy leaves shone  brightly in the slanting rays of the nearly setting sun, to a lawn as  large, as thickly carpeted with smoothly shaven grass and many-hued  flowers, and as finely shaded with giant oaks, graceful magnolias, and  groves of orange trees, as any they had passed. The house--a grand old  mansion with spacious rooms, wide cool halls and corridors--was now in  full view, now half concealed by the trees and shrubbery.    The boat rounded to at a little pier opposite the dwelling, and in another  moment our friends had landed, and leaving the servants to attend to the  baggage were walking on towards the house.          CHAPTER SIXTH.        \"Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?       Draw near them then in being merciful,       Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.\"                                   --SHAKESPEARE.      \"Papa, it seems an earthly paradise,\" said Elsie, \"and like a dream that I  have seen all before.\"    \"A dream that was a reality. And it is all your own, my darling,\" he  answered with a proud, fond look into the bright animated face, keenly  enjoying her pleasure.    \"But what, what is going on there?\" she asked, gazing intently in the  direction of the negro quarter, where a large crowd of them, probably all  belonging to the plantation, were assembled.    At that instant something rose in the air and descended again, and a wild  shriek, a woman's wail of agony, rent the air.    Elsie flew over the ground as though she had been a winged creature, her  father having to exert himself to keep pace with her. But the whip had  descended again and again, another and another of those wild shrieks  testifying to the sharpness of its "]]]
