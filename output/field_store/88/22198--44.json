Others may do so  occasionally, but it may only be by accident. They sometimes stumble  upon the principle, but not understanding how they did so, they cannot  reproduce the desired effects at will. The singer who understands her  business must know just how she produces tones and vocal effects. She  can then do them at all times, under adverse circumstances, even when  nervous, or not in the mood, or indisposed.      SELF-STUDY    \"How did I learn to know these things? By constant study, by constant  listening--for I have very keen ears--by learning the sensations  produced in throat and larynx when I made tones that were correctly  placed, were pleasing and at the same time made the effects I was  seeking.    \"Milan is my home city--beautiful Milano under the blue Italian skies,  the bluest in the world. As a young girl, the daughter of well-to-do  parents, I studied piano at the Royal Conservatory there, and also  musical theory and counterpoint. I shall ever be grateful I started in  this way, with a thorough musical foundation, for it has always been of  great advantage to me in further study. When my father met with  reverses, I made good use of my pianistic training by giving piano  lessons and making a very fair income for a young girl.    \"But I longed to sing! Is it not the birthright of every Italian to have  a voice? I began to realize I had a voice which might be cultivated. I  had always sung a little--every one does; song is the natural,  spontaneous expression of our people. But I wished to do more--to  express myself in song. So I began to teach myself by singing scales and  vocalizes between my piano lessons. Meanwhile I studied all the books on  singing I could lay hands on, and then tried to put the principles I  learned in this way in practice. In trying to do this I had to find out  everything for myself. And that is why I know them! I know exactly what  I am about when I sing, I know what muscles are being used, and in what  condition they ought to be; what parts of the anatomy are called into  action and why. Nature has given me two great gifts, a voice and good  health; for both these gifts I am deeply grateful. The first I have  developed through arduous toil; the second I endeavor to preserve  through careful living, regular hours and plenty of exercise in the  fresh air. I have developed the voice and trained it in the way that  seemed to me best for it. There are as many kinds of voices as there are  persons; it seems to me each voice should be treated in the way best  suited to its possessor. How can any other person tell you how that  should be done?\" And the singer gave me a bright look, and made a pretty  deprecating gesture. \"You yourself must have the intelligence to  understand your own case and learn how to treat it.      NEVER STRAIN THE VOICE    \"A singer who would keep her voice in the best condition, should  constantly and reasonably exercise it. I always do a half hour or so of  exercises, vocalizes and scales every morning; these are never  neglected. But I never do anything to strain the voice in any way. We  are told many fallacies by vocal teachers. One is that the diaphragm  must be held firmly in order to give support to the tone. It seems to me  this is a serious mistake. I keep the diaphragm relaxed. Thus tone  production, in my case, is made at all times with ease; there is never  any strain. You ask if it is not very fatiguing to sing against a large  orchestra, as we have to, and with a temperamental conductor, like  Marinuzzi, for instance, I do not find it so; there is a pure, clear  tone, which by its quality, placement and ease of production, will carry  farther than mere power ever can. It can be heard above a great  orchestra, and it _gets over_.      USE OF THE VOWELS    \"Young singers ask me what vowels to use in vocal practice. In my own  study I use them all. Of course some are more valuable than others. The  O is good, the E needs great care; the Ah is the most difficult of all.  I am aware this is contrary to the general idea. But I maintain that the  Ah is most difficult; for if you overdo it and the lips are too wide  apart, the result is a white tone. And on the other hand, if the lips  are nearer--or too near together, or are not managed rightly, stiffness  or a throaty quality is apt to result; then the tone cannot 'float.' I  have found the best way is to use the mixed vowels, one melting into the  other. The tone can be started with each vowel in turn, and then mingled  with the rest of the vowels. Do you know, the feathered songster I love  best--the nightingale--uses the mixed vowels too. Ah, how much I have  learned from him and from other birds also! Some of them have harsh  tones--real quacks--because they open their bills too far, or in a  special way. But the nightingale has such a lovely dark tone, a 'covered  tone,' which goes to the heart. It has the most exquisite quality in the  world. I have learned much from the birds, about what not to do and what  to do.      MEMORIZING    \"In taking up a new role I begin with the story, the libretto, so I may  first learn what it is about, its meaning and psychology. I take it to  bed with me, or have it by me if lying down, because I understand  musical composition and can get a clear idea of the composer's meaning  without going to the instrument. After a short time I begin to work it  out at the piano, in detail, words and music together. For a great role  like the _Somnambula_ or _Traviata_, I must spend three or four years,  perhaps more, in preparation, before bringing it to public performance.  It takes a long time to master thoroughly an operatic role, to work it  out from all sides, the singing, the acting, the characterization. To  the lay mind, if you can sing, you can easily act a part and also  memorize it. They little know the labor which must be bestowed on that  same role before it can be presented in such a shape as to be adequate,  in a way that will get it across. It does not go in a few weeks or even  months; it is the work of years. And even then it is never really  finished, for it can always be improved with more study, with more care  and thought.      THE NECESSITY FOR LANGUAGES    \"We hear much about need for study of languages by the singer, and  indeed too much stress cannot be placed on this branch of the work. I  realize that in America it is perhaps more difficult to impress people  with this necessity, as they have not the same need to use other  languages in every day life. The singer can always be considered  fortunate who has been brought up from earliest years to more than one  language. My mother was Spanish, my father Italian, so this gave me  both languages at home. Then in school I learned French, German and  English, not only a little smattering of each, but how to write and  speak them.\"    \"You certainly have mastered English remarkably well,\" I could not help  remarking, for she was speaking with great fluency, and with hardly any  accent. This seemed to please her, for she gave me one of those flashing  smiles.      COLORATURA AND DRAMATIC    \"Would you be pleased,\" I asked, \"if later on your voice should develop  into a dramatic soprano?\"    Mme. Galli-Curci thought an instant.    \"No,\" she said, \"I think I would rather keep the voice I have. I  heartily admire the dramatic voice and the roles it can sing. Raisa's  voice is for me the most beautiful I know. But after all I think, for  myself, I prefer the lyric and coloratura parts, they are so beautiful.  The old Italian composers knew well how to write for the voice. Their  music has beauty, it has melody, and melodic beauty will always make its  appeal. And the older Italian music is built up not only of melody and  fioriture, but is also dramatic. For these qualities can combine, and  do so in the last act of _Traviata_, which is so full of deep feeling  and pathos.      BREATH CONTROL    \"Perhaps, in Vocal Mastery, the greatest factor of all is the breathing.  To control the breath is what each student is striving to learn, what  every singer endeavors to perfect, what every artist should master. It  is an almost endless study and an individual one, because each organism  and mentality is different. Here, as in everything else, perfect ease  and naturalness are to be maintained, if the divine song which is the  singer's concept of beauty, is to be 'floated on the breath,' and its  merest whisper heard to the farthest corner of the gallery.      THE MATTER IN A NUTSHELL    \"To sum up then, the three requirements of vocal mastery are: a,  Management of the Larynx; b, Relaxation of the Diaphragm; c, Control of  the Breath. To these might be added a fourth; Mixed Vowels.    \"But when all these are mastered, what then? Ah, so much more it can  never be put into words. It is self-expression through the medium of  tone, for tone must always be a vital part of the singer's  individuality, colored by feeling and emotion. Tone is the outlet, the  expression of all one has felt, suffered and enjoyed. To perfect one's  own instrument, one's medium of expression, must always be the singer's  joy and satisfaction.\"    \"And you will surely rest when the arduous season is over?\"    \"Yes, I will rest when the summer comes, and will return to Italy this  year. But even though I seem to rest, I never neglect my vocal practice;  that duty and pleasure is always performed.\"    And with a charming smile and clasp of the hand, she said adieu.

This last condition  will necessitate adjusting the height occasionally when changing from  large to small tools.          CHAPTER X    TOOL PROCESSES IN FACE-PLATE AND CHUCK TURNING      B-I--1-a. Straight Cuts    1. ROUGHING OFF CORNERS. (3/4\" GOUGE.) FIG. 14. The tool rest is set  crosswise to the bed of the lathe and parallel to the face of the stock.    Place the gouge on the rest with the handle well down. Roll the gouge to  the left until the grind which forms the cutting edge is perpendicular  to the stock. The point of contact should be slightly below the center  or nose of the tool.    The handle of the gouge is then swung well to the back of the lathe or  to the operator's right. The gouge is then pushed forward into the stock  and to the left, making a shearing cut. The cut should not be too heavy.  The starting point for this cut should be a line which will indicate the  largest diameter or circle that can be made from the block.--This cut  should be repeated until the corners are removed from the block.    To complete the cutting of thick stock it will be found necessary to  change the tool rest to an angle of 45 deg. with the bed of the lathe.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    When hardwood is being turned it is sometimes advisable to saw the block  almost round with a compass saw or bandsaw, if one is to be had. Should  this be done the preceding steps are omitted.    The tool rest is then placed parallel with the lathe bed and a roughing  cut is taken with the gouge the entire thickness of the block.    The lathe should be run on second or third speed until the corners are  removed, and then changed to first speed.    2. CALIPERING FOR DIAMETER. The true diameter is then calipered the same  as in spindle work.    3. SMOOTHING CUT. A smoothing cut is taken with a skew chisel the same  as in spindle work.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]    4. ROUGHING CUT ON THE FACE. (3/4\" GOUGE.) FIG. 15. The rest is now  placed parallel to the bed of the lathe and slightly above the center of  the spindle. Place the gouge on the rest on its edge with the grind  toward the stock and parallel to the face to be surfaced. The nose of  the gouge is the cutting point.    The handle is then raised and the cutting point is forced toward the  center. A very thin shaving should be taken. If the gouge is allowed to  roll back so the grind above the cutting point comes in contact with the  wood it is sure to catch and gash the wood.    5. SMOOTHING THE FACE. (SMALL SKEW CHISEL.) FIG. 16. For all work up to  3\" in diameter, the surface may be smoothed by using a small skew chisel  in the same manner as in squaring the ends of Stock in cylinder work.  (Step 6--Exercise A-I--1-a, Straight Cuts.)    For larger work, place the chisel flat on the rest with the toe next to  the stock and the back edge of the chisel parallel to the face to be  surfaced.    The point of the chisel is then forced toward the center of the stock,  using the straight back of the tool as a guide against the finished  surface. Only a very thin cut should be taken at a time.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    Note:--While this operation may be termed a scraping cut, it will be  found to be much easier on the tool than if the cutting edge were held  flat against the work as in other scraping cuts.    The surface of the work should be tested for squareness by holding the  edge of the chisel or a straight edge across the face.      LAYING OFF MEASUREMENTS    In laying off measurements on the face of the stock a pencil compass or  dividers should be used. Set the compass or dividers to one-half the  diameter of the circle wanted. While one point is held at the exact  center of the stock, which is easily located while the stock is  revolving, the other is brought in contact with the revolving stock  until a circle of the correct diameter is marked.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    Should the center of the stock be cut away, rendering this method  impossible, the following method may be used: Set the compass or  dividers to the exact diameter wanted. Place one point in contact with  the stock a little to one side of the required line on the part that is  to be cut-away. Bring the other point to the stock and see if it touches  the line first made. If not, move the first point until the two points  track in the same line.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    The rest should be set at the exact center for measuring.    All measurements on the edge of the stock can be made with pencil and  rule as in cylinder turning.      B-I--2-a. Shoulder Cuts    1. EXTERNAL SHOULDERS. FIG. 18. The surplus stock at each successive  shoulder is roughed out with a 3/4\" gouge, keeping well outside the  finished measurements. The gouge for this work is held in the same  position as described in B-I--1-a, Step 1, for Roughing Off Corners.    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    2. For the finishing cut a small skew chisel is used, and the process  is the same as that used in squaring ends of stock. Both the vertical  and horizontal shoulders can be handled easily by this method. Fig, 19.    3. INTERNAL SHOULDERS. For internal shoulder cutting the same methods  may be used for roughing out and cutting the horizontal shoulders, but  for the vertical or base shoulder it will be necessary to use the  scraping process. (See \"Use of Scraping Tools.\")      B-I--3-a. Taper Cuts    Taper cutting will not be found hard as the gouge and skew chisel are  used in the same manner as described in B-I--1-a, Steps 4 and 5. After  the stock has been roughed away with the gouge to the approximate angle  desired, a smoothing cut is taken with the skew. Care should be taken  that the skew chisel is held at the exact angle of the taper desired.      B-I--4-a. V Cuts    V cutting will also be found easy as the tool process is exactly the  same as that used in spindle turning. Exercise A-I--4-a. Fig. 20.      B-I--5-a. Concave Cuts    Place the 3/4\" gouge on the rest with the handle parallel to the bed of  the lathe. Roll the gouge on its edge and swing the handle so that the  grind is perpendicular to the stock with the nose of the tool as the  cutting point.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    Force the gouge forward into the wood. As soon as the cut is started,  the handle is lowered and swung to the left; (if cutting the left side  of the concave) at the same time the tool is rolled back toward its  original position. This movement brings the cutting point farther down  on the lip and the grind, resting on the side of the cut, will force the  gouge sidewise and will form one-quarter of the circle. Fig. 21.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    This cut is continued from alternate side until the concave is nearly to  size. The cut should be tested with a templet before the finishing cut  is taken.      B-I--6-a. Convex Cuts    Rough out the stock between the beads with a parting tool.    Hold the edge of the gouge on the rest with the handle, parallel to the  bed of the lathe, to make the nose the cutting point.    Swing the handle to the left so that the grind will form a tangent to  the bead at its highest point.    The gouge is then forced into the stock and to the right; at the same  time the handle is swung to the right; keeping the grind tangent to the  bead at the point of contact. Fig. 22. This cut is continued until the  base of the bead is reached.      B-I--7-a. Combination Cuts    As in spindle turning, a combination exercise should be given at this  point to provide an opportunity for studying out the best methods of  working the various cuts just described into a finished product.      USE OF SCRAPING TOOLS    When scraping is to be employed, it should be done with only those tools  that are made for that purpose, i.e., Square Nose, Round Nose, Spear  Point, Right and Left Skew. The handling of these tools will be found  easy. The only point to remember is that they should be held flat on the  tool rest and parallel to the bed of the lathe when in use.    In general practice the ordinary skew chisel should not be used as a  scraping tool, for the cutting edge is not sharpened to withstand the  heavy strain required by such work. Should it be necessary, however, to  use a skew chisel as a scraper, the tool should be held so that the top  grind is parallel to the bed of the lathe while in use.      INTERNAL BORING    In roughing out the center for Napkin Rings, Jewel Boxes, etc., the  quickest method is to work it out with a small gouge.    Place the gouge on the rest parallel to the bed of the lathe, having the  point even with the center of the stock.    Force the gouge into the wood until a hole is bored to the depth  required. If the hole is deeper than 1\", remove the tool often and clear  out the shavings in order not to burn the point.    In order to enlarge the hole to the proper size the point of the gouge  is pressed against the left side of the hole a little above the center  and a shearing cut is taken. To obviate the danger of the tool catching,  all cuts should start from the back of the hole and proceed toward the  front.    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]      B-III--8-a. Sphere    After the sphere is turned as nearly perfect as is possible when working  between centers (Steps 1 to 4) it is cut free from the waste stock and  is centered in a chuck.    The chuck is made of any soft wood and should be cut in the end grain,  which will insure equal pressure on all sides. Equal pressure cannot be  obtained if the Chuck is cut in cross grain wood, owing to the tendency  of side grain to give more than the end grain. The sphere should be  forced into the chuck with slightly over half protruding. Very thin cuts  should be taken and the sphere should be revolved one-quarter turn after  each until true. As the sphere becomes smaller during the"]]]
