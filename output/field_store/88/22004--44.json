And, if I deserve thy favour, and  if thou hast kindness for the Kurus, do thou exhort my wicked son  Duryodhana!'    \"Vyasa said, 'O king, after having seen the Pandava brothers, here  cometh the holy Rishi Maitreya, with the desire of seeing us. That  mighty Rishi, O king, will admonish thy son for the welfare of this  race. And, O Kauravya, what he adviseth must be followed undoubtingly,  for if what he recommendeth is not done, the sage will curse thy son in  anger.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Saying this, Vyasa departed, and Maitreya made  his appearance. And the king with his son respectfully received that  way-worn chief of Munis, with offerings of the Arghya and other rites.  And king Dhritarashtra, the son of Amvika, in words of respect thus  addressed the sage, 'O holy one, hath journey from the _Kuru-jangala_  been a pleasant one? Are those heroes, the five Pandavas living happily?  Do those bulls of the Kuru race intend to stay out their time? Will the  brotherly affection of the Kauravas ever be impaired?'    \"Maitreya said, 'Setting out on a pilgrimage to the different shrines, I  arrived at _Kuru-jangala_, and there I unexpectedly saw Yudhishthira the  just in the woods of Kamyaka. And, O exalted one, many Munis had come  there to behold the high-souled Yudhishthira, dwelling in an ascetic  asylum, clad in deer-skin and wearing matted locks. It was there, O king  of kings, that I heard of the grave error committed by thy sons and the  calamity and terrible danger arisen from dice that had overtaken them.  Therefore, it is that I have come to thee, for the good of the Kauravas,  since, O exalted one, my affection is great for thee and I am delighted  with thee! O king, it is not fit that thy sons should on any account  quarrel with one another, thyself and Bhishma living. Thou art, O king,  the stake at which bulls are tied (in treading corn), and thou art  competent to punish and reward! Why dost thou overlook then this great  evil that is about to overtake all? And, O descendant of the Kurus, for  those wrongs that have been perpetrated in thy court, which are even  like the acts of wretched outcasts, thou art not well-thought amongst  the ascetics!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Then turning to the wrathful prince Duryodhana,  the illustrious Rishi Maitreya addressed him in these soft words, 'O  mighty-armed Duryodhana, O best of all eloquent men, O illustrious one,  give heed unto the words I utter for thy good! O king, seek not to  quarrel with the Pandavas! And, O bull among men, compass thou thy own  good as also of the Pandavas, of the Kurus and of the world! All those  tigers among men are heroes of high prowess in war, gifted with the  strength of ten thousand elephants, with bodies hard as the thunderbolt,  holding fast by their promises, and proud of their manliness! They have  slain the enemies of the celestials--those Rakshasas capable of assuming  any form at will, such as were headed by Hidimva and Kirmira! When those  high-souled ones went from hence that Rakshasa of fierce soul obstructed  their nocturnal path even like an immoveable hill. And even as a tiger  slayeth a little deer, Bhima, that foremost of all endued with strength,  and ever delighted in fight, slew that monster. Consider also, O king,  how while out on his campaign of conquest, Bhima slew in battle that  mighty warrior, Jarasandha, possessing the strength of ten thousand  elephants. Related to Vasudeva and having the sons of king Drupada as  their brothers-in-law, who that is subject to decrepitude and death  would undertake to cope with them in battle? O bull of the Bharata race,  let there be peace between thee and Pandavas! Follow thou my counsels  and surrender not thyself to anger!'    \"O king, thus admonished by Maitreya, Duryodhana began to slap his thigh  resembling the trunk of the elephant, and smilingly began to scratch the  ground with his foot. And the wicked wretch spake not a word, but hung  down his head. And, O monarch, beholding Duryodhana thus offer him a  slight by scratching the earth silently, Maitreya became angry. And, as  if commissioned by fate, Maitreya, the best of Munis, overwhelmed by  wrath, set his mind upon cursing Duryodhana! And then, with eyes red in  anger, Maitreya, touching water, cursed the evil-minded son of  Dhritarashtra, saying, 'Since, slighting me thou declinest to act  according to my words, thou shalt speedily reap the fruit of this thy  insolence! In the great war which shall spring out of the wrongs  perpetrated by thee, the mighty Bhima shall smash that thigh of thine  with a stroke of his mace!'    \"When the Muni had spoken so, king Dhritarashtra began to pacify the  sage, in order that what he had said might not happen. But Maitreya  said, 'O king, if thy son concludeth peace with the Pandavas, this curse  of mine, O child, will not take effect, otherwise it must be as I have  said!'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Desirous of ascertaining the might of Bhima, that  foremost of kings, the father of Duryodhana, then asked Maitreya,  saying, 'How was Kirmira slain by Bhima?'    \"Maitreya said, 'I shall not speak again unto thee, O king, for my words  are not regarded by thy son. After I have gone away, Vidura will relate  everything unto thee!' And saying this, Maitreya went away to the place  whence he had come. And Duryodhana also went out perturbed at the  tidings of Kirmira's death (at the hand of Bhima).\"      SECTION XI    (Kirmirabadha Parva)    \"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Kshatta, I am desirous to hear of the  destruction of Kirmira! Do thou tell me how the encounter took place  between the Rakshasa and Bhimasena!'    \"Vidura said, 'Listen to the story of that feat of Bhimasena of  superhuman achievements! I have often heard of it in course of my  conversation with the Pandavas (while I was with them). O foremost of  kings, defeated at dice the Pandavas departed from hence and travelling  for three days and nights they at length reached those woods that go by  the name of Kamyaka. O king, just after the dreadful hour of midnight  when all nature is asleep, when man-eating Rakshasas of terrible deeds  begin to wander, the ascetics and the cowherds and other rangers of the  forest used to shun the woods of Kamyaka and fly to a distance from fear  of cannibals. And, O Bharata, as the Pandavas were at this hour entering  those woods a fearful Rakshasa of flaming eyes appeared before them with  a lighted brand, obstructing their path. And with outstretched arms and  terrible face, he stood obstructing the way on which those perpetuators  of the Kuru race were proceeding. With eight teeth standing out, with  eyes of coppery hue, and with the hair of his head blazing and standing  erect, the fiend looked like a mass of clouds reflecting the rays of the  sun or mingled with lightning flashes and graced with flocks of cranes  underneath on their wings. And uttering frightful yells and roaring like  a mass of clouds charged with rain, the fiend began to spread the  illusion proper to his species. Hearing that terrible roar, birds along  with other creatures that live on land or in water, began to drop down  in all directions, uttering cries of fear. And in consequence of the  deer and the leopards and the buffaloes and the bears flying about in  all directions, it seemed as if the forest itself was in motion. And  swayed by the wind raised by the sighs of the Rakshasa, creepers growing  at a great distance seemed to embrace the trees with their arms of  coppery leaves. And at that moment, a violent wind began to blow, and  the sky became darkened with the dust that covered it. And as grief is  the greatest enemy of the object of the five senses, even so appeared  before the Pandavas that unknown foe of theirs. And beholding the  Pandavas from a distance clad in black deer-skins, the Rakshasa  obstructed their passage through the forest even like the _Mainaka_  mountain. And at the sight of him never seen before the lotus-eyed  Krishna, agitated with fear, closed her eyes. And she whose braids had  been dishevelled by the hand of Dussasana, stationed in the midst of the  five Pandavas, looked like a stream chafing amid five hills. And seeing  her overwhelmed with fear the five Pandavas supported her as the five  senses influenced by desire adhere to the pleasures relating to their  objects. And Dhaumya of great (ascetic) energy, in the presence of the  sons of Pandu, destroyed the fearful illusion that had been spread by  the Rakshasa, by applying various _mantras_, calculated to destroy the  Rakshasa. And beholding his illusion dispelled, the mighty Rakshasa of  crooked ways, capable of assuming any form at will, expanded his eyes in  wrath and seemed like death himself. Then king Yudhishthira, endued with  great wisdom, addressed him saying, 'Who art thou, and whose (son)? Tell  us what we should do for thee.' The Rakshasa thus addressed, answered  Yudhishthira the just, saying, 'I am the brother of Vaka, the celebrated  Kirmira. I live at ease in these deserted woods of Kamyaka, daily  procuring my food by vanquishing men in fight. Who are ye that have come  near me in the shape of my food? Defeating ye all in fight, I will eat  ye with pleasure.'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"O Bharata, hearing these words of the wretch,  Yudhishthira announced his own name and lineage, saying, 'I am king  Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pandu, of whom thou mayst have heard.  Deprived of my kingdom, I have with my brothers Bhimasena and Arjuna and  the others, in course of my wanderings, come into this terrible forest  which is thy dominion, desirous of passing my period of exile here!'    \"Vidura continued, 'Kirmira said unto Yudhishthira, \"By good luck it is  that fate hath accomplished today my long-accomplished desire! With  weapons upraised have I been continually ranging the entire earth with  the object of slaying Bhima."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#7)"],[1,"to save them. Krishna quietly rises up, sucks the fire  into his mouth and ends the blaze.    The hot weather now comes. Trees are heavy with blossom, peacocks strut in  the glades and a general lethargy seizes the cowherds. One day Krishna and  his friends are out with the cattle when Pralamba, a demon in human form,  comes to join them. Krishna warns Balarama of the demon's presence and  tells him to await an opportunity to kill him. He then divides the  cowherds into two groups and starts them on the game of guessing fruits  and flowers. Krishna's side loses and as a penalty they have to run a  certain distance carrying Balarama's side on their shoulders. Pralamba  carries Balarama. He runs so fast that he quickly outstrips the others. As  he reaches the forest, he changes size, becoming 'large as a black hill.'  He is about to kill Balarama when Balarama himself rains blows upon him  and kills him instead.[23] While this is happening, the cows get lost,  another forest fire ensues and Krishna has once again to intervene. He  extinguishes the fire, regains the cattle and escorts the cowherds to  their homes.[24] When the others hear what has happened, they are filled  with wonder 'but obtain no clue to the actions of Krishna.'    During all this time, Krishna as 'son' of the wealthiest and most  influential cowherd, Nanda, has been readily accepted by the cowherd  children as their natural leader. His lack of fear, his bravery in coping  with demons, his resourcefulness in extricating the cowherds from awkward  situations, his complete self-confidence and finally his princely bearing  have revealed him as someone altogether above the ordinary. From time to  time he has disclosed his true nature as Vishnu but almost immediately has  exercised his 'illusory' power and prevented the cowherds from remembering  it. He has consequently lived among them as God but their love and  admiration are still for him as a boy. It is at this point that the  _Purana_ now moves to what is perhaps its most significant phase--a  description of Krishna's effects on the cowgirls.    [Footnote 11: Note 7.]    [Footnote 12: Magadha--a region corresponding to present-day South Bihar.]    [Footnote 13: Plate 3.]    [Footnote 14: Note 8.]    [Footnote 15: Note 9.]    [Footnote 16: Plate 4.]    [Footnote 17: Plate 5.]    [Footnote 18: Plate 6. In the _Harivansa_, the cause of the migration is  given as a dangerous influx of wolves.]    [Footnote 19: Note 10.]    [Footnote 20: Plate 7.]    [Footnote 21: Note 7.]    [Footnote 22: Plate 8.]    [Footnote 23: Plate 9.]    [Footnote 24: Plate 10.]        (ii) The Loves of the Cowgirls      We have seen how during his infancy Krishna's pranks have already made  him the darling of the women. As he grows up, he acquires a more adult  charm. In years he is still a boy but we are suddenly confronted with  what is to prove the very heart of the story--his romances with the  cowgirls. Although all of them are married, the cowgirls find his presence  irresistible and despite the warnings of morality and the existence of  their husbands, each falls utterly in love with him. As Krishna wanders in  the forest, the cowgirls can talk of nothing but his charms. They do their  work but their thoughts are on him. They stay at home but all the time  each is filled with desperate longing. One day Krishna plays on his flute  in the forest. Playing the flute is the cowherds' special art and Krishna  has, therefore, learnt it in his childhood. But, as in everything else,  his skill is quite exceptional and Krishna's playing has thus a beauty all  its own. From where they are working the cowgirls hear it and at once are  plunged in agitation. They gather on the road and say to each other,  'Krishna is dancing and singing in the forest and will not be home till  evening. Only then shall we see him and be happy.'    One cowgirl says, 'That happy flute to be played on by Krishna! Little  wonder that having drunk the nectar of his lips the flute should trill  like the clouds. Alas! Krishna's flute is dearer to him than we are for  he keeps it with him night and day. The flute is our rival. Never is  Krishna parted from it.' A second cowgirl speaks. 'It is because the flute  continually thought of Krishna that it gained this bliss.' And a third  says, 'Oh! why has Krishna not made us into flutes that we might stay with  him day and night?' The situation in fact has changed overnight for far  from merely appealing to the cowgirls' maternal instincts, Krishna is now  the darling object of their most intense passion.    Faced with this situation, the cowgirls discuss how best to gain Krishna  as their lover. They recall that bathing in the early winter is believed  to wipe out sin and fulfil the heart's desires. They accordingly go to the  river Jumna, bathe in its waters and after making clay images of Parvati,  Siva's consort, pray to her to make Krishna theirs. They go on doing this  for many days.    One day they choose a part of the river where there is a steep bank.  Taking off their clothes they leave them on the grass verge, enter the  water and swim around calling out their love for Krishna. Unknown to them,  Krishna is in the vicinity and is grazing the cows. He steals quietly up,  sees them in the river, makes their clothes into a bundle and then climbs  up with it into a tree. When the cowgirls come out of the water, they  cannot find their clothes until at last one of them spies Krishna sitting  in the tree. The cowgirls hurriedly squat down in the water entreating  Krishna to return their clothes. Krishna, however, tells them to come up  out of the water and ask him one by one. The cowgirls say, 'But this will  make us naked. You are making an end of our friendship.' Krishna says,  'Then you shall not have your clothes back.' The cowgirls answer, 'Why do  you treat us so? It is only for you that we have bathed all these days.'  Krishna answers, 'If that is really so, then do not be bashful or deceive  me. Come and take your clothes.' Finding no alternative, the cowgirls  argue amongst themselves that since Krishna already knows the secrets of  their minds and bodies, there is no point in being ashamed before him,  and they come up out of the water shielding their nakedness with their  hands.[25] Krishna tells them to raise their hands and then he will return  their clothes. The cowgirls do so begging him not to make fun of them and  to give them at least something in return. Krishna now hands the clothes  back giving as excuse for his conduct the following somewhat specious  reason. 'I was only giving you a lesson,' he says. 'The god Varuna lives  in water, so if anyone goes naked into it he loses his character. This was  a secret, but now you know it.' Then he relents. 'I have told you this  because of your love. Go home now but come back in the early autumn and we  will dance together.' Hearing this the cowgirls put on their clothes and  wild with love return to their village.    At this point the cowgirls' love for Krishna is clearly physical. Although  precocious in his handling of the situation, Krishna is still the rich  herdsman's handsome son and it is as this rather than as God that they  regard him. Yet the position is never wholly free from doubt for in loving  Krishna as a youth, it is as if they are from time to time aware of  adoring him as God. No precise identifications are made and yet so strong  are their passions that seemingly only God himself could evoke them. And  although no definite explanation is offered, it is perhaps this same idea  which underlies the following incident.    One day Krishna is in the forest when his cowherd companions complain  of feeling hungry. Krishna observes smoke rising from the direction of  Mathura and infers that the Brahmans are cooking food preparatory to  making sacrifice. He asks the cowherds to tell them that Krishna is hungry  and would like some of this food. The Brahmans of Mathura angrily spurn  the request, saying 'Who but a low cowherd would ask for food in the midst  of a sacrifice?' 'Go and ask their wives,' Krishna says, 'for being kind  and virtuous they will surely give you some.' Krishna's power with women  is then demonstrated once more. His fame as a stealer of hearts has  preceded him and the cowherds have only to mention his name for the wives  of the Brahmans to run to serve him. They bring out gold dishes, load them  with food, brush their husbands aside and hurry to the forest. One husband  stops his wife, but rather than be left behind the woman leaves her body  and reaches Krishna before the others. When the women arrive they marvel  at Krishna's beauty. 'He is Nanda's son,' they say. 'We heard his name and  everything else was driven from our minds. Let us gaze on this darling  object of our lives. O Krishna, it is due to you that we have seen you and  thus got rid of all our sins. Those stupid Brahmans, our husbands, mistook  you for a mere man. But you are God. As God they offer to you prayers,  penance, sacrifice and love. How then can they deny you food?' Krishna  replies that they should not worship him for he is only the child of the  cowherd, Nanda. He was hungry and they took pity on him, and he only  regrets that being far from home he cannot return their hospitality. They  must now go home as their presence is needed for the sacrifices and their  husbands must still be waiting. So cool an answer dismays the women and  they say, 'Great king, we loved your lotus-like face. We came to you  despite our families. They tried to stop us but we ignored them. If they  do not take us back, where shall we go? And one of us, prevented by her  husband, gave her life rather than not see you.' At this Krishna smiles,  reveals the woman and says, 'Whoever loves God never dies. She was here  before you.' Krishna then eats the food and assuring them that their  husbands will say nothing, sends them back to Mathura. When they arrive, "]]]
