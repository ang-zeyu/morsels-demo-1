[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14006"],[0,"An English Grammar (#7)"],[1,"the subject: \"A bent twig makes a crooked _tree_.\"    (3) _In apposition_ with some other nominative word, adding to the  meaning of that word: \"The reaper _Death_ with his sickle keen.\"    (4) _In direct address_: \"_Lord Angus_, thou hast lied!\"    (5) _With a participle in an absolute or independent phrase_ (there is  some discussion whether this is a true nominative): \"The _work_ done,  they returned to their homes.\"    (6) _With an infinitive in exclamations_: \"_David_ to die!\"      Exercise.    Pick out the nouns in the nominative case, and tell which use of the  nominative each one has.    1. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead; excessive grief, the  enemy of the living.    2.  Excuses are clothes which, when asked unawares,       Good Breeding to naked Necessity spares.    3. Human experience is the great test of truth.    4. Cheerfulness and content are great beautifiers.    5. Three properties belong to wisdom,--nature, learning, and  experience; three things characterize man,--person, fate, and merit.    6.  But of all plagues, good Heaven, thy wrath can send,       Save, save, oh save me from the candid friend!    7. Conscience, her first law broken, wounded lies.    8. They charged, sword in hand and visor down.    9.  O sleep! O gentle sleep!       Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee?      II. Uses of the Objective.    59. The objective case is used as follows:--    (1) _As the direct object of a verb_, naming the person or thing  directly receiving the action of the verb: \"Woodman, spare that  _tree_!\"    (2) _As the indirect object of a verb_, naming the person or thing  indirectly affected by the action of the verb: \"Give the _devil_ his  due.\"    (3) _Adverbially_, defining the action of a verb by denoting _time_,  _measure_, _distance_, etc. (in the older stages of the language, this  took the regular accusative inflection): \"Full _fathom_ five thy  father lies;\" \"Cowards die many _times_ before their deaths.\"    (4) _As the second object_, completing the verb, and thus becoming  part of the predicate in acting upon an object: \"Time makes the worst  enemies _friends_;\" \"Thou makest the storm a _calm_.\" In these  sentences the real predicates are _makes friends_, taking the object  _enemies_, and being equivalent to one verb, _reconciles_; and _makest  a calm_, taking the object _storm_, and meaning calmest. This is also  called the _predicate objective_ or the _factitive object_.    (5) _As the object of a preposition_, the word toward which the  preposition points, and which it joins to another word: \"He must have  a long spoon that would eat with the _devil_.\"    The preposition sometimes takes the _possessive_ case of a noun, as  will be seen in Sec. 68.    (6) _In apposition with another objective_: \"The opinions of this  junto were completely controlled by Nicholas Vedder, a _patriarch_ of  the village, and _landlord_ of the inn.\"      Exercise.    Point out the nouns in the objective case in these sentences, and tell  which use each has:--    1. Tender men sometimes have strong wills.    2. Necessity is the certain connection between cause and effect.    3. Set a high price on your leisure moments; they are sands of  precious gold.    4. But the flood came howling one day.    5. I found the urchin Cupid sleeping.    6. Five times every year he was to be exposed in the pillory.    7. The noblest mind the best contentment has.    8. Multitudes came every summer to visit that famous natural  curiosity, the Great Stone Face.    9.  And whirling plate, and forfeits paid,       His winter task a pastime made.    10. He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,       And gave the leper to eat and drink.      III. Uses of the Possessive.      60. The possessive case always modifies another word, expressed or  understood. There are three forms of possessive showing how a word is  related in sense to the modified word:--    (1) _Appositional possessive_, as in these expressions,--         The blind old man of _Scio's_ rocky isle.--BYRON.         Beside a pumice isle in _Baiae's_ bay.--SHELLEY.    In these sentences the phrases are equivalent to _of the rocky isle  [of] Scio_, and _in the bay [of] Baiae_, the possessive being really  equivalent here to an appositional objective. It is a poetic  expression, the equivalent phrase being used in prose.    (2) _Objective possessive_, as shown in the sentences,--         Ann Turner had taught her the secret before this last good lady       had been hanged for _Sir Thomas Overbury's_ murder.--HAWTHORNE.         He passes to-day in building an air castle for to-morrow, or in       writing _yesterday's_ elegy.--THACKERAY    In these the possessives are equivalent to an objective after a verbal  expression: as, _for murdering Sir Thomas Overbury_; _an elegy to  commemorate yesterday_. For this reason the use of the possessive here  is called objective.    (3) _Subjective possessive_, the most common of all; as,--         The unwearied sun, from day to day,       Does his Creator's power display.       --ADDISON.    If this were expanded into _the power which his Creator possesses_,  the word _Creator_ would be the subject of the verb: hence it is  called a subjective possessive.      61. This last-named possessive expresses a variety of relations.  _Possession_ in some sense is the most common. The kind of relation  may usually be found by expanding the possessive into an equivalent  phrase: for example, \"_Winter's_ rude tempests are gathering now\"  (i.e., tempests that winter is likely to have); \"His beard was of  _several days'_ growth\" (i.e., growth which several days had  developed); \"The _forest's_ leaping panther shall yield his spotted  hide\" (i.e., the panther which the forest hides); \"Whoso sheddeth  _man's_ blood\" (blood that man possesses).      [Sidenote: _How the possessive is formed._]    62. As said before (Sec. 56), there are only two case forms. One is  the simple form of a word, expressing the relations of nominative and  objective; the other is formed by adding _'s_ to the simple form,  making the possessive singular. To form the possessive plural, only  the apostrophe is added if the plural nominative ends in _-s_; the  _'s_ is added if the plural nominative does not end in _-s_.      Case Inflection.      [Sidenote: _Declension or inflection of nouns._]    63. The full declension of nouns is as follows:--                              SINGULAR.     PLURAL.    1. _Nom. and Obj._   lady          ladies     _Poss._           lady's        ladies'    2. _Nom. and Obj._   child         children     _Poss._           child's       children's    [Sidenote: _A suggestion._]    NOTE.--The difficulty that some students have in writing the  possessive plural would be lessened if they would remember there are  two steps to be taken:--    (1) Form the nominative plural according to Secs 39-53    (2) Follow the rule given in Sec. 62.      Special Remarks on the Possessive Case.      [Sidenote: _Origin of the possessive with its apostrophe._]    64. In Old English a large number of words had in the genitive case  singular the ending _-es_; in Middle English still more words took  this ending: for example, in Chaucer, \"From every _schires_ ende,\"  \"Full worthi was he in his _lordes_ werre [war],\" \"at his _beddes_  syde,\" \"_mannes_ herte [heart],\" etc.    [Sidenote: _A false theory._]    By the end of the seventeenth century the present way of indicating  the possessive had become general. The use of the apostrophe, however,  was not then regarded as standing for the omitted vowel of the  genitive (as _lord's_ for _lordes_): by a false theory the ending was  thought to be a contraction of _his_, as schoolboys sometimes write,  \"George Jones _his_ book.\"    [Sidenote: _Use of the apostrophe._]    Though this opinion was untrue, the apostrophe has proved a great  convenience, since otherwise words with a plural in _-s_ would have  three forms alike. To the eye all the forms are now distinct, but to  the ear all may be alike, and the connection must tell us what form is  intended.    The use of the apostrophe in the plural also began in the seventeenth  century, from thinking that _s_ was not a possessive sign, and from a  desire to have distinct forms.      [Sidenote: _Sometimes_ s _is left out in the possessive singular._]    65. Occasionally the _s_ is dropped in the possessive singular if  the word ends in a hissing sound and another hissing sound follows,  but the apostrophe remains to mark the possessive; as, _for goodness'  sake, Cervantes' satirical work_.    In other cases the _s_ is seldom omitted. Notice these three examples  from Thackeray's writings: \"Harry ran upstairs to his _mistress's_  apartment;\" \"A postscript is added, as by the _countess's_ command;\"  \"I saw what the _governess's_ views were of the matter.\"      [Sidenote: _Possessive with compound expressions._]    66. In compound expressions, containing words in apposition, a word  with a phrase, etc., the possessive sign is usually last, though  instances are found with both appositional words marked.    Compare the following examples of literary usage:--         Do not the Miss Prys, my neighbors, know the amount of my income,       the items of my _son's_, _Captain Scrapegrace's_, tailor's       bill--THACKERAY.         The world's pomp and power sits there on this hand: on that,       stands up for God's truth one man, the _poor miner Hans Luther's_       son.--CARLYLE.         They invited me in the _emperor their master's_ name.--SWIFT.         I had naturally possessed myself of _Richardson the painter's_       thick octavo volumes of notes on the \"Paradise Lost.\"--DE       QUINCEY.         They will go to Sunday schools to teach classes of little       children the age of Methuselah or the dimensions of _Og the king       of Bashan's_ bedstead.--HOLMES.    More common still is the practice of turning the possessive into an  equivalent phrase; as, _in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#7)"],[1,"he circled Kilimanjaro and hunted in the foothills to the  north of that mightiest of mountains as he had discovered that in  the neighborhood of the armies there was no hunting at all. Some  pleasure he derived through conjuring mental pictures from time to  time of the German he had left in the branches of the lone tree at  the bottom of the high-walled gulch in which was penned the starving  lion. He could imagine the man's mental anguish as he became weakened  from hunger and maddened by thirst, knowing that sooner or later he  must slip exhausted to the ground where waited the gaunt man-eater.  Tarzan wondered if Schneider would have the courage to descend to  the little rivulet for water should Numa leave the gulch and enter  the cave, and then he pictured the mad race for the tree again  when the lion charged out to seize his prey as he was certain to  do, since the clumsy German could not descend to the rivulet without  making at least some slight noise that would attract Numa's attention.    But even this pleasure palled, and more and more the ape-man found  himself thinking of the English soldiers fighting against heavy  odds and especially of the fact that it was Germans who were beating  them. The thought made him lower his head and growl and it worried  him not a little--a bit, perhaps, because he was finding it difficult  to forget that he was an Englishman when he wanted only to be an  ape. And at last the time came when he could not longer endure the  thought of Germans killing Englishmen while he hunted in safety a  bare march away.    His decision made, he set out in the direction of the German camp,  no well-defined plan formulated; but with the general idea that  once near the field of operations he might find an opportunity to  harass the German command as he so well knew how to do. His way  took him along the gorge close to the gulch in which he had left  Schneider, and, yielding to a natural curiosity, he scaled the cliffs  and made his way to the edge of the gulch. The tree was empty, nor  was there sign of Numa, the lion. Picking up a rock he hurled it  into the gulch, where it rolled to the very entrance to the cave.  Instantly the lion appeared in the aperture; but such a different-looking  lion from the great sleek brute that Tarzan had trapped there two  weeks before. Now he was gaunt and emaciated, and when he walked  he staggered.    \"Where is the German?\" shouted Tarzan. \"Was he good eating, or only  a bag of bones when he slipped and fell from the tree?\"    Numa growled. \"You look hungry, Numa,\" continued the ape-man. \"You  must have been very hungry to eat all the grass from your lair and  even the bark from the tree as far up as you can reach. Would you  like another German?\" and smiling he turned away.    A few minutes later he came suddenly upon Bara, the deer, asleep  beneath a tree, and as Tarzan was hungry he made a quick kill,  and squatting beside his prey proceeded to eat his fill. As he  was gnawing the last morsel from a bone his quick ears caught the  padding of stealthy feet behind him, and turning he confronted  Dango, the hyena, sneaking upon him.  With a growl the ape-man  picked up a fallen branch and hurled it at the skulking brute. \"Go  away, eater of carrion!\" he cried; but Dango was hungry and being  large and powerful he only snarled and circled slowly about as  though watching for an opportunity to charge. Tarzan of the Apes  knew Dango even better than Dango knew himself. He knew that the  brute, made savage by hunger, was mustering its courage for an  attack, that it was probably accustomed to man and therefore more  or less fearless of him and so he un-slung his heavy spear and  laid it ready at his side while he continued his meal, all the time  keeping a watchful eye upon the hyena.    He felt no fear, for long familiarity with the dangers of his wild  world had so accustomed him to them that he took whatever came as  a part of each day's existence as you accept the homely though no  less real dangers of the farm, the range, or the crowded metropolis.  Being jungle bred he was ready to protect his kill from all comers  within ordinary limitations of caution. Under favorable conditions  Tarzan would face even Numa himself and, if forced to seek safety  by flight, he could do so without any feeling of shame. There was  no braver creature roamed those savage wilds and at the same time  there was none more wise--the two factors that had permitted him  to survive.    Dango might have charged sooner but for the savage growls of the  ape-man--growls which, coming from human lips, raised a question  and a fear in the hyena's heart. He had attacked women and children  in the native fields and he had frightened their men about their  fires at night; but he never had seen a man-thing who made this  sound that reminded him more of Numa angry than of a man afraid.    When Tarzan had completed his repast he was about to rise and hurl  a clean-picked bone at the beast before he went his way, leaving  the remains of his kill to Dango; but a sudden thought stayed him  and instead he picked up the carcass of the deer, threw it over  his shoulder, and set off in the direction of the gulch. For a  few yards Dango followed, growling, and then realizing that he was  being robbed of even a taste of the luscious flesh he cast discretion  to the winds and charged. Instantly, as though Nature had given him  eyes in the back of his head, Tarzan sensed the impending danger  and, dropping Bara to the ground, turned with raised spear. Far  back went the brown, right hand and then forward, lightning-like,  backed by the power of giant muscles and the weight of his brawn  and bone. The spear, released at the right instant, drove straight  for Dango, caught him in the neck where it joined the shoulders  and passed through the body.    When he had withdrawn the shaft from the hyena Tarzan shouldered  both carcasses and continued on toward the gulch.  Below lay Numa  beneath the shade of the lone tree and at the ape-man's call he  staggered slowly to his feet, yet weak as he was, he still growled  savagely, even essaying a roar at the sight of his enemy. Tarzan  let the two bodies slide over the rim of the cliff. \"Eat, Numa!\"  he cried. \"It may be that I shall need you again.\" He saw the lion,  quickened to new life at the sight of food, spring upon the body  of the deer and then he left him rending and tearing the flesh as  he bolted great pieces into his empty maw.    The following day Tarzan came within sight of the German lines.  From a wooded spur of the hills he looked down upon the enemy's  left flank and beyond to the British lines. His position gave him  a bird's-eye view of the field of battle, and his keen eyesight  picked out many details that would not have been apparent to a man  whose every sense was not trained to the highest point of perfection  as were the ape-man's. He noted machine-gun emplacements cunningly  hidden from the view of the British and listening posts placed well  out in No Man's Land.    As his interested gaze moved hither and thither from one point of  interest to another he heard from a point upon the hillside below  him, above the roar of cannon and the crack of rifle fire, a single  rifle spit. Immediately his attention was centered upon the spot  where he knew a sniper must be hid.  Patiently he awaited the next  shot that would tell him more surely the exact location of the  rifleman, and when it came he moved down the steep hillside with  the stealth and quietness of a panther. Apparently he took no  cognizance of where he stepped, yet never a loose stone was disturbed  nor a twig broken--it was as though his feet saw.    Presently, as he passed through a clump of bushes, he came to the  edge of a low cliff and saw upon a ledge some fifteen feet below  him a German soldier prone behind an embankment of loose rock and  leafy boughs that hid him from the view of the British lines. The  man must have been an excellent shot, for he was well back of the  German lines, firing over the heads of his fellows. His high-powered  rifle was equipped with telescope sights and he also carried  binoculars which he was in the act of using as Tarzan discovered  him, either to note the effect of his last shot or to discover  a new target. Tarzan let his eye move quickly toward that part of  the British line the German seemed to be scanning, his keen sight  revealing many excellent targets for a rifle placed so high above  the trenches.    The Hun, evidently satisfied with his observations, laid aside  his binoculars and again took up his rifle, placed its butt in the  hollow of his shoulder and took careful aim. At the same instant a  brown body sprang outward from the cliff above him.  There was no  sound and it is doubtful that the German ever knew what manner of  creature it was that alighted heavily upon his back, for at the  instant of impact the sinewy fingers of the ape-man circled the  hairy throat of the Boche. There was a moment of futile struggling  followed by the sudden realization of dissolution--the sniper was  dead.    Lying behind the rampart of rocks and boughs, Tarzan looked down  upon the scene below. Near at hand were the trenches of the Germans.  He could see officers and men moving about in them and almost in  front of him a well-hidden machine gun was traversing No Man's Land  in an oblique direction, striking the British at such an angle as  to make it difficult for them to locate it.    Tarzan watched, toying idly with the rifle of the dead German.  Presently he fell to examining the mechanism of the piece. He  glanced again toward the German trenches and changed the adjustment  of the sights, then he placed the rifle to his shoulder and took  aim. Tarzan was an excellent shot. With his civilized friends he  had hunted big game with the weapons of civilization and though he  never had killed except for food or in self-defense he had "]]]
