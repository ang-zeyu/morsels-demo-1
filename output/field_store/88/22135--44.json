You are a perfect genius, Ed. I wonder if this sort  of thing--er--thieving--is dormant in most of us? I say, old fellow, I  wish I hadn't looked at that book of Hamar's. Do you know, directly I  took it up, an extraordinary sensation of cunning came over me; and I  declare, when I put it down, I felt it would take very little to make  me a criminal!\"    \"We're both criminals now--in the eyes of the law--anyway!\" Curtis  said. \"And now we've got so far there's no alternative but to go on!  It's easier for a hundred camels to pass through the eye of a needle  than for a clerk to get work, that's a fact. The markets are  hopelessly overstocked--no one wants us! No one helps us! No one even  thinks about us. The labouring man gets pity and cents galore--we get  nothing!--nothing but rotten pay whilst we work, and when we're out of  work, dosshouses or kerbstones. D--n clerks, I say. D--n everything!  There's no justice in creation--there's no justice in anything--and  the only people who prate of it are those who have never known what it  is to want. Say, when shall we take the next lot?\"    \"When we're obliged, not before!\" Kelson said. \"Or rather, you do as  you like--and I'll do the same.\"    \"Well, I'm not going to commit suicide anyhow,\" Curtis sneered. \"We  haven't the money to buy poison--and I've no mind to drown myself or  cut my throat--they're too painful! If we don't go on doing what we've  done to-night, what are we going to do?\"    \"Trust to luck,\" Kelson sighed.    \"All right--you trust to luck--but I won't trust any more in  Providence, and that's a fact,\" Curtis retorted. \"We've been done  enough. Now I'm for doing other people. Good-night.\"    He tumbled into the makeshift bed as he spoke; and in a few minutes,  worn out after the unwonted exertions of the evening, both men were  fast asleep.    They were at breakfast next morning--real _dejeuner a la  carte_--sausages, bread, water--and they were doing ample justice to  it, when some one rapped at the door. For a few seconds there was  silence. Their hearts stood still. Had they been followed, after all?  Was it the police? Some one spoke--and they breathed again. It was  Hamar.    \"This looks like starving, I must say!\" Hamar exclaimed, as he sniffed  his way into the room and sat on the bed. \"Why, from what you fellows  told me last night I thought you were cleared out. And here you are,  stuffing like roosters! You look a bit surprised to see me, but you'll  look more surprised, I reckon, when I tell you what brings me here.  You remember that book?\"    Kelson and Curtis nodded.    \"Well,\" Hamar went on. \"I read it after you left last night, and I've  come to the conclusion that there's something in it that may be of use  to us.\"    \"Us!\" Curtis ejaculated.    \"Yes! Us!\" Hamar mimicked. \"It contains full particulars of how we can  get in touch with certain Occult Powers--that can give us money or  anything else we want!\"    \"Rot, of course!\" Curtis said.    \"You say that now. But, listen to me,\" Hamar replied. \"Since I've read  that book, I believe there's a lot more in Occultism than people  imagine. You may recollect the name of the author of the book--Thomas  Maitland? Well! to begin with, he impresses me as being truthful; and  he not only believed in Magic but he practised it. If he hadn't gone  into details I shouldn't think anything of it, but he's so darned  thorough, and tells you exactly what you've got to do to get in touch  with the Occult Powers and to practise sorcery. He learned it all from  that old MS. he found, written by an Atlantean; and the Atlanteans, he  says, were adepts in every form of Occultism. I tell you, this chap  himself scoffed at it at first; and it was more out of curiosity, he  says, than because he was convinced, that he began to experiment. He  afterwards came to the conclusion that the Atlanteans were no fools.  What they had written about the Occult was absolutely correct--there  was another world, and it was possible to get in touch with it. Now,  if Thomas Maitland was able to practise sorcery, why can't we? There  was a gap of close on twenty thousand years between his time and that  of Atlantis, and there's not much more than two hundred years between  his day and ours. But, of course, if you're going to pooh-pooh the  whole thing I won't trouble to tell you any more!\"    \"Well, Leon,\" Kelson ejaculated, \"magic and sorcery do seem a trifle  out of date, don't they? Could any one look out of the window at what  is going on in the streets below, and at the same time believe in  fairies and hobgoblins? Still the book made a bit of an impression on  me, so that I'm inclined to agree with you. Anyway, go ahead! Ed is  agreeable, aren't you, Ed?\"    Curtis gave a sulky nod. \"I'm not averse to anything that may put us  in the way of a livelihood,\" he said.    Hamar, somewhat appeased, briefly informed them of the tests and other  preliminaries necessary for the acquirement of the Black Art, and  without more ado proposed that they--the three of them--should form a  Syndicate and call it the Sorcery Company Limited. \"To begin with,\" he  said, \"we might sell tricks and spells, and later on tackle something  more subtle. Why, we could soon knock all the jugglers and doctors on  the head--and make a huge fortune.\"    \"That is to say if it isn't all humbug!\" Curtis observed.    \"Well--do you or don't you think it worth trying?\" Hamar cut in. \"You  call me a Jew--but Jews, you know, have a tolerably cool head, and a  keen faculty for business. They don't touch anything unless it is  pretty certain to bring them in money. Will you try?\"    \"Y-e-s!\" Curtis said slowly; \"I'll try.\"    \"And you, Matt?\" Hamar queried. \"We must have three.\"    \"I don't mind trying,\" Kelson replied. \"I expect it will be only a  try.\"    \"That settles it, then!\" Hamar cried. \"Now, we'll get to business. To  begin with we're all wholly occupied with things of this world--money  chiefly!\"    \"Sometimes music!\" Curtis said sententiously.    \"And sometimes girls,\" Kelson joined in. \"Music's a pose on Ed's part.  I don't believe he really cares a bit for it. He's far too material.\"    \"Just what I want him to be!\" Hamar laughed. \"Girls are material  enough too--especially when you take them out to supper. Anyhow, money  is our first consideration, isn't it?\"    To this there was general assent.    \"The preliminary requirement is fixed then,\" Hamar said. \"Now for the  week of wild oats! Lying, stealing, cheating--anything to counteract  the code of Moses! Let's take them in turn. Lying won't trouble us  much. Every one lies. Lying is the stock-in-trade of doctors, lawyers,  sky pilots, storekeepers--\"    \"And dentists!\" Curtis chimed in.    \"And shop girls!\" Kelson added.    \"All women--rich as well as poor!\" Hamar went on. \"Lying is woman's  birthright. She lies about her age, her looks, her clothes--everything.  With a lie she sends callers away, and when she is in the mood,  entertains them with lies. Women are born liars, but they are not the  only liars. In these days of keen competition every one lies--every  editor, publisher, undertaker, piano-tuner, dustman--they couldn't live  if they didn't. Moreover lying is natural to us all. Every child lies  as soon as it can speak; and education merely teaches him to lie the  more effectually. Lying comes just as natural as sweating--\"    \"Or kissing,\" Kelson interrupted.    \"Or any of the other so-called vices,\" Hamar continued. \"So we can  manage that all right. As to cheating--having nothing to cheat  with--according to instructions we've got to keep in with each other,  so present company is excepted--we must pass over that. Now--how about  thieving!\"    \"Never done any yet, so can't say,\" Curtis exclaimed.    \"Nor I either,\" Kelson put in rather hurriedly.    \"Well, I didn't suppose you had!\" Hamar laughed; \"though, after all,  more than half the world does thieve--all employers steal labour from  their employes, all tradesmen steal a profit--the wholesale man from  the middleman--the middleman from the retailer. Every Government  thieves. Look at England--righteous England! At one time or another  she has stolen land in every part of the world. But theft is an ugly  word. When statesmen steal it's called diplomacy, when the rich steal  it's called kleptomania or business, and it's only when the poor steal  that stealing is termed theft. We who have every excuse--we who are  starving--will be content with--that is to say--we will only  take--just enough to keep us alive--a few lumps of sugar, a handful of  raisins, or a loaf of bread. How about that?\"    \"I might manage that,\" Curtis said. \"I might--but I don't want to get  caught.\"    \"And you, Matt?\"    \"I don't mind stealing food so much,\" Kelson said. \"In the face of so  much wealth--and waste too--it seems a bigger sin to starve than to  steal a loaf of bread.\"    \"The lying and stealing are fixed then,\" Hamar laughed. \"What you have  to do, too, is to make the most of every opportunity you can find of  doing people--present company excepted--bad turns.\"    \"I don't see how--in our present condition--we can do any one much  harm,\" Curtis remarked. \"We haven't even the means to buy a tin sword,  let alone a bomb or pistol. If we wish them ill, perhaps, that will do  instead.\"    \"Possibly--but don't be such an ass as to wish any one any good!\"  Hamar said. \"Do your best to carry out the injunctions I have given  you, and we will meet here, this day week, to discuss the tests.\"          CHAPTER IV    THE TESTS      Seven days later, Hamar again knocked at Curtis's and Kelson's door  and walked in. A faint sigh of relief escaped him.    \"I see we are all right so far,\" he said. \"I wondered whether I should  find you both flown, or lying stretched in the icy hands of death.  Have you experimented?\"    \"We have,\" Curtis said. \"We've"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14328"],[0,"The Consolation of Philosophy (#7)"],[1," pray that they still may hold. For while they still remain, however  things may go, I shall ride out the storm. Yet thou seest how much is  shorn of the splendour of my fortunes.'    'We are gaining a little ground,' said she, 'if there is something in  thy lot wherewith thou art not yet altogether discontented. But I cannot  stomach thy daintiness when thou complainest with such violence of grief  and anxiety because thy happiness falls short of completeness. Why, who  enjoys such settled felicity as not to have some quarrel with the  circumstances of his lot? A troublous matter are the conditions of human  bliss; either they are never realized in full, or never stay  permanently. One has abundant riches, but is shamed by his ignoble  birth. Another is conspicuous for his nobility, but through the  embarrassments of poverty would prefer to be obscure. A third, richly  endowed with both, laments the loneliness of an unwedded life. Another,  though happily married, is doomed to childlessness, and nurses his  wealth for a stranger to inherit. Yet another, blest with children,  mournfully bewails the misdeeds of son or daughter. Wherefore, it is not  easy for anyone to be at perfect peace with the circumstances of his  lot. There lurks in each several portion something which they who  experience it not know nothing of, but which makes the sufferer wince.  Besides, the more favoured a man is by Fortune, the more fastidiously  sensitive is he; and, unless all things answer to his whim, he is  overwhelmed by the most trifling misfortunes, because utterly unschooled  in adversity. So petty are the trifles which rob the most fortunate of  perfect happiness! How many are there, dost thou imagine, who would  think themselves nigh heaven, if but a small portion from the wreck of  thy fortune should fall to them? This very place which thou callest  exile is to them that dwell therein their native land. So true is it  that nothing is wretched, but thinking makes it so, and conversely every  lot is happy if borne with equanimity. Who is so blest by Fortune as not  to wish to change his state, if once he gives rein to a rebellious  spirit? With how many bitternesses is the sweetness of human felicity  blent! And even if that sweetness seem to him to bring delight in the  enjoying, yet he cannot keep it from departing when it will. How  manifestly wretched, then, is the bliss of earthly fortune, which lasts  not for ever with those whose temper is equable, and can give no perfect  satisfaction to the anxious-minded!    'Why, then, ye children of mortality, seek ye from without that  happiness whose seat is only within us? Error and ignorance bewilder  you. I will show thee, in brief, the hinge on which perfect happiness  turns. Is there anything more precious to thee than thyself? Nothing,  thou wilt say. If, then, thou art master of thyself, thou wilt possess  that which thou wilt never be willing to lose, and which Fortune cannot  take from thee. And that thou mayst see that happiness cannot possibly  consist in these things which are the sport of chance, reflect that, if  happiness is the highest good of a creature living in accordance with  reason, and if a thing which can in any wise be reft away is not the  highest good, since that which cannot be taken away is better than it,  it is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness by reason of  its instability. And, besides, a man borne along by this transitory  felicity must either know or not know its unstability. If he knows not,  how poor is a happiness which depends on the blindness of ignorance! If  he knows it, he needs must fear to lose a happiness whose loss he  believes to be possible. Wherefore, a never-ceasing fear suffers him not  to be happy. Or does he count the possibility of this loss a trifling  matter? Insignificant, then, must be the good whose loss can be borne so  equably. And, further, I know thee to be one settled in the belief that  the souls of men certainly die not with them, and convinced thereof by  numerous proofs; it is clear also that the felicity which Fortune  bestows is brought to an end with the death of the body: therefore, it  cannot be doubted but that, if happiness is conferred in this way, the  whole human race sinks into misery when death brings the close of all.  But if we know that many have sought the joy of happiness not through  death only, but also through pain and suffering, how can life make men  happy by its presence when it makes them not wretched by its loss?'        SONG IV.    THE GOLDEN MEAN.          Who founded firm and sure      Would ever live secure,      In spite of storm and blast      Immovable and fast;      Whoso would fain deride      The ocean's threatening tide;--      His dwelling should not seek      On sands or mountain-peak.      Upon the mountain's height      The storm-winds wreak their spite:      The shifting sands disdain      Their burden to sustain.      Do thou these perils flee,      Fair though the prospect be,      And fix thy resting-place      On some low rock's sure base.      Then, though the tempests roar,      Seas thunder on the shore,      Thou in thy stronghold blest      And undisturbed shalt rest;      Live all thy days serene,      And mock the heavens' spleen.        V.      'But since my reasonings begin to work a soothing effect within thy  mind, methinks I may resort to remedies somewhat stronger. Come,  suppose, now, the gifts of Fortune were not fleeting and transitory,  what is there in them capable of ever becoming truly thine, or which  does not lose value when looked at steadily and fairly weighed in the  balance? Are riches, I pray thee, precious either through thy nature or  in their own? What are they but mere gold and heaps of money? Yet these  fine things show their quality better in the spending than in the  hoarding; for I suppose 'tis plain that greed Alva's makes men hateful,  while liberality brings fame. But that which is transferred to another  cannot remain in one's own possession; and if that be so, then money is  only precious when it is given away, and, by being transferred to  others, ceases to be one's own. Again, if all the money in the world  were heaped up in one man's possession, all others would be made poor.  Sound fills the ears of many at the same time without being broken into  parts, but your riches cannot pass to many without being lessened in the  process. And when this happens, they must needs impoverish those whom  they leave. How poor and cramped a thing, then, is riches, which more  than one cannot possess as an unbroken whole, which falls not to any one  man's lot without the impoverishment of everyone else! Or is it the  glitter of gems that allures the eye? Yet, how rarely excellent soever  may be their splendour, remember the flashing light is in the jewels,  not in the man. Indeed, I greatly marvel at men's admiration of them;  for what can rightly seem beautiful to a being endowed with life and  reason, if it lack the movement and structure of life? And although such  things do in the end take on them more beauty from their Maker's care  and their own brilliancy, still they in no wise merit your admiration  since their excellence is set at a lower grade than your own.    'Does the beauty of the fields delight you? Surely, yes; it is a  beautiful part of a right beautiful whole. Fitly indeed do we at times  enjoy the serene calm of the sea, admire the sky, the stars, the moon,  the sun. Yet is any of these thy concern? Dost thou venture to boast  thyself of the beauty of any one of them? Art _thou_ decked with  spring's flowers? is it _thy_ fertility that swelleth in the fruits of  autumn? Why art thou moved with empty transports? why embracest thou an  alien excellence as thine own? Never will fortune make thine that which  the nature of things has excluded from thy ownership. Doubtless the  fruits of the earth are given for the sustenance of living creatures.  But if thou art content to supply thy wants so far as suffices nature,  there is no need to resort to fortune's bounty. Nature is content with  few things, and with a very little of these. If thou art minded to force  superfluities upon her when she is satisfied, that which thou addest  will prove either unpleasant or harmful. But, now, thou thinkest it  fine to shine in raiment of divers colours; yet--if, indeed, there is  any pleasure in the sight of such things--it is the texture or the  artist's skill which I shall admire.    'Or perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes thee happy? Why,  if they behave viciously, they are a ruinous burden to thy house, and  exceeding dangerous to their own master; while if they are honest, how  canst thou count other men's virtue in the sum of thy possessions? From  all which 'tis plainly proved that not one of these things which thou  reckonest in the number of thy possessions is really thine. And if there  is in them no beauty to be desired, why shouldst thou either grieve for  their loss or find joy in their continued possession? While if they are  beautiful in their own nature, what is that to thee? They would have  been not less pleasing in themselves, though never included among thy  possessions. For they derive not their preciousness from being counted  in thy riches, but rather thou hast chosen to count them in thy riches  because they seemed to thee precious.    'Then, what seek ye by all this noisy outcry about fortune? To chase  away poverty, I ween, by means of abundance. And yet ye find the result  just contrary. Why, this varied array of precious furniture needs more  accessories for its protection; it is a true saying that they want most  who possess most, and, conversely, they want very little who measure  their abundance by nature's requirements, not by the superfluity of vain  display. Have ye no good of your own implanted within you, that ye seek  your good in things external and separate? Is the"]]]
