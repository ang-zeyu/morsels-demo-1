It is quite time for us to recognise that unemployment and  absence of duties is as great a disadvantage to the rich as it is to  the poor; the sort of employment must necessarily differ, but the  spirit in which it is to be done is the same.    One point that one would wish to emphasise with regard to all  adolescents is that although occupation for the whole day is most  desirable, hard work should occupy but a certain proportion of the  waking hours. For any adolescent, or indeed for any of us to attempt  to work hard for twelve or fourteen hours out of the twenty-four is to  store up trouble. It is not possible to lay down any hard and fast  rule as to the length of hours of work, because the other factors in  the problem vary so greatly. One person may be exhausted by four  hours of intellectual effort, whereas another is less fatigued by  eight; and further, the daily occupations vary greatly in the demand  that they make on attention and on such qualities as reason, judgment,  and power of initiation. Those who teach or learn such subjects as  mathematics, or those who are engaged in such occupations as  portrait-painting and the higher forms of musical effort, must  necessarily take more out of themselves than those who are employed in  feeding a machine, in nursing a baby, or in gardening operations.          CHAPTER V.    THE FINAL AIM OF EDUCATION.      The great problem before those who have the responsibility for the  training of the young is that of preparing them to take their place in  the world as fathers, mothers, and citizens, and among the fundamental  duties connected with this responsibility must come the placing before  the eyes of the young people high ideals, attractive examples, and the  securing to them the means of adequate preparation. As a nation it  seems to be with us at present as it was with the people of Israel in  the days of Eli: \"the word of the Lord was precious (or scarce) in  those days; there was no open vision.\" We seem to have come to a time  of civilisation in which there is much surface refinement and a  widespread veneer of superficial knowledge, but in which there is  little enthusiasm and in which the great aim and object of teaching  and of training is but too little realised. In the endeavour to know a  little of all things we seem to have lost the capacity for true and  exhaustive knowledge of anything. It would appear as if the remedy for  this most unsatisfactory state of things has to commence long before  the years of adolescence, even while the child is yet in its cradle.  The old-fashioned ideas of duty, obedience, and discipline must be  once more household words and living entities before the race can  enter on a period of regeneration. We want a poet with the logic of  Browning, the sweetness of Tennyson, and the force of Rudyard Kipling,  to sing a song that would penetrate through indifference, sloth, and  love of pleasure, and make of us the nation that we might be, and of  which the England of bygone years had the promise.    Speaking specially with regard to girls, let us first remember that  the highest earthly ideal for a woman is that she should be a good  wife and a good mother. It is not necessary to say this in direct  words to every small girl, but she ought to be so educated, so guided,  as to instinctively realise that wifehood and motherhood is the flower  and perfection of her being. This is the hope and ideal that should  sanctify her lessons and sweeten the right and proper discipline of  life. All learning, all handicraft, and all artistic training should  take their place as a preparation to this end. Each generation that  comes on to the stage of life is the product of that which preceded  it. It is the flower of the present national life and the seed of that  which is to come. We ought to recognise that all educational aims and  methods are really subordinate to this great end; if this were  properly realised by adolescents it would be of the greatest service  and help in their training. The deep primal instinct of fatherhood and  motherhood would help them more than anything else to seek earnestly  and successfully for the highest attainable degree of perfection of  their own bodies, their own minds, and their own souls. It is,  however, impossible to aim at an ideal that is unseen and even  unknown, and although the primal instinct exists in us all, its  fruition is greatly hindered by the way in which it is steadily  ignored, and by the fact that any proclamation of its existence is  considered indiscreet and even indelicate. How are children to develop  a holy reverence for their own bodies unless they know of their  wonderful destiny? If they do not recognise that at least in one  respect God has confided to them in some measure His own creative  function, how can they jealously guard against all that would injure  their bodies and spoil their hopes for the exercise of this function?  There is, even at the present time, a division of opinion as to when  and in what manner children are to be made aware of their august  destiny. We are indeed only now beginning to realise that ignorance is  not necessarily innocence, and that knowledge of these matters may be  sanctified and blessed. It is, however, certain that the conspiracy of  silence which lasted so many years has brought forth nothing but evil.  If a girl remains ignorant of physiological facts, the shock of the  eternal realities of life that come to her on marriage is always  pernicious and sometimes disastrous. If, on the other hand, such  knowledge is obtained from servants and depraved playfellows, her  purity of mind must be smirched and injured.    Even among those who hold that children ought to be instructed, there  is a division of opinion as to when this instruction is to begin. Some  say at puberty, others a few years later, perhaps on the eve of  marriage, and yet others think that the knowledge will come with less  shock, with less personal application, and therefore in a more natural  and useful manner from the very beginning of conscious life. These  last would argue--why put the facts of reproduction on a different  footing from those of digestion and respiration? As facts in the  physical life they hold a precisely similar position. Upon the due  performance of bodily functions depends the welfare of the whole  organism, and although reproduction, unlike the functions of  respiration and digestion, is not essential to the life of the  individual, it is essential to the life of the nation.    The facts of physiology are best taught to little children by a  perfectly simple recognition of the phenomena of life around them--the  cat with her kittens, the bird with its fledgelings, and still more  the mother with her infant, are all common facts and beautiful types  of motherhood. Instead of inventing silly and untrue stories as to the  origin of the kitten and the fledgeling, it is better and wiser to  answer the child's question by a direct statement of fact, that God  has given the power to His creatures to perpetuate themselves, that  the gift of Life is one of His good gifts bestowed in mercy on all His  creatures. The mother's share in this gift and duty can be observed  by, and simply explained to, the child from its earliest years; it  comes then with no shock, no sense of shame, but as a type of joy and  gladness, an image of that holiest of all relations, the Eternal  Mother and the Heavenly Child.    Somewhat later in life, probably immediately before puberty in boys  and shortly after puberty in girls, the father's share in this mystery  may naturally come up for explanation. The physiological facts  connected with this are not so constantly in evidence before children,  and therefore do not press for explanation in the same way as do those  of motherhood, but the time comes soon in the schoolboy's life when  the special care of his own body has to be urged on him, and this  knowledge ought to come protected by the sanction that unless he is  faithful to his trust he cannot look to the reward of a happy home  life with wife and children. In the case of the girl the question as  to fatherhood is more likely to arise out of the reading of the Bible  or other literature, or by her realisation that at any rate in the  case of human parenthood there is evidently the intermediation of a  father. The details of this knowledge need not necessarily be pressed  on the adolescent girl, but it is a positive cruelty to allow the  young woman to marry without knowing the facts on which her happiness  depends.    Another way in which the mystery of parenthood can be simply and  comfortably taught is through the study of vegetable physiology. The  fertilisation of the ovules by pollen which falls directly from the  anthers on to the stigma can be used as a representation of similar  facts in animal physiology. It is very desirable, however, that this  study of the vegetable should succeed and not precede that of the  domestic animals in the teaching of boys and girls.    Viewed from this standpoint there is surely no difficulty to the  parent in imparting to the child this necessary knowledge. We have to  remember that children have to know the mysteries of life. They cannot  live in the world without seeing the great drama constantly displayed  to them in family life and in the lives of domesticated animals. They  cannot read the literature of Greece and Rome, nay, they cannot study  the Book of Books, without these facts being constantly brought to  mind. A child's thirst for the interpretation of this knowledge is  imperative and unsatiable--not from prurience nor from evil-mindedness,  but in obedience to a law of our nature, the child demands this  knowledge--and will get it. It is for fathers and mothers to say  whether these sublime and beautiful mysteries shall be lovingly  and reverently unveiled by themselves or whether the child's mind  shall "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#7)"],[1,"bed? This, Nazarene, I do indeed call slavery;  whereas, to the faithful, hath the Prophet assigned upon earth the  patriarchal privileges of Abraham our father, and of Solomon, the wisest  of mankind, having given us here a succession of beauty at our pleasure,  and beyond the grave the black-eyed houris of Paradise.\"    \"Now, by His name that I most reverence in heaven,\" said the Christian,  \"and by hers whom I most worship on earth, thou art but a blinded and  a bewildered infidel!--That diamond signet which thou wearest on thy  finger, thou holdest it, doubtless, as of inestimable value?\"    \"Balsora and Bagdad cannot show the like,\" replied the Saracen; \"but  what avails it to our purpose?\"    \"Much,\" replied the Frank, \"as thou shalt thyself confess. Take my  war-axe and dash the stone into twenty shivers: would each fragment be  as valuable as the original gem, or would they, all collected, bear the  tenth part of its estimation?\"    \"That is a child's question,\" answered the Saracen; \"the fragments of  such a stone would not equal the entire jewel in the degree of hundreds  to one.\"    \"Saracen,\" replied the Christian warrior, \"the love which a true knight  binds on one only, fair and faithful, is the gem entire; the affection  thou flingest among thy enslaved wives and half-wedded slaves is  worthless, comparatively, as the sparkling shivers of the broken  diamond.\"    \"Now, by the Holy Caaba,\" said the Emir, \"thou art a madman who hugs  his chain of iron as if it were of gold! Look more closely. This ring  of mine would lose half its beauty were not the signet encircled and  enchased with these lesser brilliants, which grace it and set it off.  The central diamond is man, firm and entire, his value depending on  himself alone; and this circle of lesser jewels are women, borrowing  his lustre, which he deals out to them as best suits his pleasure or  his convenience. Take the central stone from the signet, and the  diamond itself remains as valuable as ever, while the lesser gems are  comparatively of little value. And this is the true reading of thy  parable; for what sayeth the poet Mansour: 'It is the favour of man  which giveth beauty and comeliness to woman, as the stream glitters no  longer when the sun ceaseth to shine.'\"    \"Saracen,\" replied the Crusader, \"thou speakest like one who never saw  a woman worthy the affection of a soldier. Believe me, couldst thou  look upon those of Europe, to whom, after Heaven, we of the order of  knighthood vow fealty and devotion, thou wouldst loathe for ever the  poor sensual slaves who form thy haram. The beauty of our fair ones  gives point to our spears and edge to our swords; their words are our  law; and as soon will a lamp shed lustre when unkindled, as a knight  distinguish himself by feats of arms, having no mistress of his  affection.\"    \"I have heard of this frenzy among the warriors of the West,\" said the  Emir, \"and have ever accounted it one of the accompanying symptoms of  that insanity which brings you hither to obtain possession of an empty  sepulchre. But yet, methinks, so highly have the Franks whom I have met  with extolled the beauty of their women, I could be well contented to  behold with mine own eyes those charms which can transform such brave  warriors into the tools of their pleasure.\"    \"Brave Saracen,\" said the Knight, \"if I were not on a pilgrimage to the  Holy Sepulchre, it should be my pride to conduct you, on assurance of  safety, to the camp of Richard of England, than whom none knows better  how to do honour to a noble foe; and though I be poor and unattended  yet have I interest to secure for thee, or any such as thou seemest, not  safety only, but respect and esteem. There shouldst thou see several  of the fairest beauties of France and Britain form a small circle, the  brilliancy of which exceeds ten-thousandfold the lustre of mines of  diamonds such as thine.\"    \"Now, by the corner-stone of the Caaba!\" said the Saracen, \"I will  accept thy invitation as freely as it is given, if thou wilt postpone  thy present intent; and, credit me, brave Nazarene, it were better for  thyself to turn back thy horse's head towards the camp of thy people,  for to travel towards Jerusalem without a passport is but a wilful  casting-away of thy life.\"    \"I have a pass,\" answered the Knight, producing a parchment, \"Under  Saladin's hand and signet.\"    The Saracen bent his head to the dust as he recognized the seal and  handwriting of the renowned Soldan of Egypt and Syria; and having kissed  the paper with profound respect, he pressed it to his forehead, then  returned it to the Christian, saying, \"Rash Frank, thou hast sinned  against thine own blood and mine, for not showing this to me when we  met.\"    \"You came with levelled spear,\" said the Knight. \"Had a troop of  Saracens so assailed me, it might have stood with my honour to have  shown the Soldan's pass, but never to one man.\"    \"And yet one man,\" said the Saracen haughtily, \"was enough to interrupt  your journey.\"    \"True, brave Moslem,\" replied the Christian; \"but there are few such as  thou art. Such falcons fly not in flocks; or, if they do, they pounce  not in numbers upon one.\"    \"Thou dost us but justice,\" said the Saracen, evidently gratified by  the compliment, as he had been touched by the implied scorn of the  European's previous boast; \"from us thou shouldst have had no wrong. But  well was it for me that I failed to slay thee, with the safeguard of  the king of kings upon thy person. Certain it were, that the cord or the  sabre had justly avenged such guilt.\"    \"I am glad to hear that its influence shall be availing to me,\" said the  Knight; \"for I have heard that the road is infested with robber-tribes,  who regard nothing in comparison of an opportunity of plunder.\"    \"The truth has been told to thee, brave Christian,\" said the Saracen;  \"but I swear to thee, by the turban of the Prophet, that shouldst thou  miscarry in any haunt of such villains, I will myself undertake thy  revenge with five thousand horse. I will slay every male of them, and  send their women into such distant captivity that the name of their  tribe shall never again be heard within five hundred miles of Damascus.  I will sow with salt the foundations of their village, and there shall  never live thing dwell there, even from that time forward.\"    \"I had rather the trouble which you design for yourself were in revenge  of some other more important person than of me, noble Emir,\" replied the  Knight; \"but my vow is recorded in heaven, for good or for evil, and I  must be indebted to you for pointing me out the way to my resting-place  for this evening.\"    \"That,\" said the Saracen, \"must be under the black covering of my  father's tent.\"    \"This night,\" answered the Christian, \"I must pass in prayer and  penitence with a holy man, Theodorick of Engaddi, who dwells amongst  these wilds, and spends his life in the service of God.\"    \"I will at least see you safe thither,\" said the Saracen.    \"That would be pleasant convoy for me,\" said the Christian; \"yet might  endanger the future security of the good father; for the cruel hand of  your people has been red with the blood of the servants of the Lord, and  therefore do we come hither in plate and mail, with sword and lance, to  open the road to the Holy Sepulchre, and protect the chosen saints and  anchorites who yet dwell in this land of promise and of miracle.\"    \"Nazarene,\" said the Moslem, \"in this the Greeks and Syrians have much  belied us, seeing we do but after the word of Abubeker Alwakel, the  successor of the Prophet, and, after him, the first commander of true  believers. 'Go forth,' he said, 'Yezed Ben Sophian,' when he sent that  renowned general to take Syria from the infidels; 'quit yourselves like  men in battle, but slay neither the aged, the infirm, the women, nor the  children. Waste not the land, neither destroy corn and fruit-trees; they  are the gifts of Allah. Keep faith when you have made any covenant,  even if it be to your own harm. If ye find holy men labouring with their  hands, and serving God in the desert, hurt them not, neither destroy  their dwellings. But when you find them with shaven crowns, they are of  the synagogue of Satan! Smite with the sabre, slay, cease not till  they become believers or tributaries.' As the Caliph, companion of the  Prophet, hath told us, so have we done, and those whom our justice has  smitten are but the priests of Satan. But unto the good men who, without  stirring up nation against nation, worship sincerely in the faith of  Issa Ben Mariam, we are a shadow and a shield; and such being he whom  you seek, even though the light of the Prophet hath not reached him,  from me he will only have love, favour, and regard.\"    \"The anchorite whom I would now visit,\" said the warlike pilgrim, \"is, I  have heard, no priest; but were he of that anointed and sacred order, I  would prove with my good lance, against paynim and infidel--\"    \"Let us not defy each other, brother,\" interrupted the Saracen; \"we  shall find, either of us, enough of Franks or of Moslemah on whom to  exercise both sword and lance. This Theodorick is protected both by Turk  and Arab; and, though one of strange conditions at intervals, yet, on  the whole, he bears himself so well as the follower of his own prophet,  that he merits the protection of him who was sent--\"    \"Now, by Our Lady, Saracen,\" exclaimed the Christian, \"if thou darest  name in the same breath the camel-driver of Mecca with--\"    An electrical shock of passion thrilled through the form of the Emir;  but it was only momentary, and the calmness of his reply had both  dignity and reason in it, when he said, \"Slander not him whom thou  knowest not--the rather that we venerate the founder of thy religion,  while we condemn the doctrine which your priests have spun from it. I  will myself guide thee to the cavern of the hermit, which, methinks,"]]]
