The moment he was sure of the place, he rushed forward without  caution. Meeko was in the midst of a prolonged snicker at the scolding  jays, when he heard a scratch on the bark below, turned, looked down,  and fled with a cry of terror. Kagax was already halfway up the tree,  the red fire blazing in his eyes.    The squirrel rushed to the end of a branch, jumped to a smaller  spruce, ran that up to the top; then, because his fright had made him  forget the tree paths that ordinarily he knew very well, he sprang out  and down to the ground, a clear fifty feet, breaking his fall by  catching and holding for an instant a swaying fir tip on the way. Then  he rushed pell-mell over logs and rocks, and through the underbrush to  a maple, and from that across a dozen trees to another giant spruce,  where he ran up and down desperately over half the branches, crossing  and crisscrossing his trail, and dropped panting at last into a little  crevice under a broken limb. There he crouched into the smallest  possible space and watched, with an awful fear in his eyes, the rough  trunk below.    Far behind him came Kagax, grim, relentless, silent as death. He paid  no attention to scratching claws nor swaying branches, never looking  for the jerking red tip of Meeko's tail, nor listening for the loud  thump of his feet when he struck the ground. A pair of brave little  flycatchers saw the chase and rushed at the common enemy, striking him  with their beaks, and raising an outcry that brought a score of  frightened, clamoring birds to the scene. But Kagax never heeded. His  whole being seemed to be concentrated in the point of his nose. He  followed like a bloodhound to the top of the second spruce, sniffed  here and there till he caught the scent of Meeko's passage through the  air, ran to the end of a branch in the same direction and leaped to  the ground, landing not ten feet from the spot where the squirrel had  struck a moment before. There he picked up the trail, followed over  logs and rocks to the maple, up to the third branch, and across fifty  yards of intervening branches to the giant spruce where his victim sat  half paralyzed, watching from his crevice.    Here Kagax was more deliberate. Left and right, up and down he went  with deadly patience, from the lowest branch to the top, a hundred  feet above, following every cross and winding of the trail. A dozen  times he stopped, went back, picked up the fresher trail, and went on  again. A dozen times he passed within a few feet of his victim,  smelling him strongly, but scorning to use his eyes till his nose had  done its perfect work. So he came to the last turn, followed the last  branch, his nose to the bark, straight to the crevice under the broken  branch, where Meeko crouched shivering, knowing it was all over.    There was a cry, that no one heeded in the woods; there was a flash  of sharp teeth, and the squirrel fell, striking the ground with a  heavy thump. Kagax ran down the trunk, sniffed an instant at the body  without touching it, and darted away to the form among the ferns. He  had passed it at daylight when he was too heavy for killing.    Halfway to the lake, he stopped; a thrilling song from a dead spruce  top bubbled out over the darkening woods. When a hermit thrush sings  like that, his nest is somewhere just below. Kagax began twisting in  and out like a snake among the bushes, till a stir in a tangle of  raspberry vines, which no ears but his or an owl's would ever notice,  made him shrink close to the ground and look up. The red fire blazed  in his eyes again; for there was Mother Thrush just settling onto her  nest, not five feet from his head.    To climb the raspberry vines without shaking them, and so alarming the  bird, was out of the question; but there was a fire-blasted tree just  behind. Kagax climbed it stealthily on the side away from the bird,  crept to a branch over the nest, and leaped down. Mother Thrush was  preening herself sleepily, feeling the grateful warmth of her eggs and  listening to the wonderful song overhead, when the blow came. Before  she knew what it was, the sharp teeth had met in her brain. The  pretty nest would never again wait for a brooding mother in the  twilight.    All the while the wonderful song went on; for the hermit thrush,  pouring his soul out, far above on the dead spruce top, heard not a  sound of the tragedy below.    Kagax flung the warm body aside savagely, bit through the ends of the  three eggs, wishing they were young thrushes, and leaped to the  ground. There he just tasted the brain of his victim to whet his  appetite, listened a moment, crouching among the dead leaves, to the  melody overhead, wishing it were darker, so that the hermit would come  down and he could end his wicked work. Then he glided away to the  young hares.    There were five of them in the form, hidden among the coarse brakes of  a little opening. Kagax went straight to the spot. A weasel never  forgets. He killed them all, one after another, slowly, deliberately,  by a single bite through the spine, tasting only the blood of the last  one. Then he wriggled down among the warm bodies and waited, his nose  to the path by which Mother Hare had gone away. He knew well she would  soon be coming back.    Presently he heard her, _put-a-put_, _put-a-put_, hopping along the  path, with a waving line of ferns to show just where she was. Kagax  wriggled lower among his helpless victims; his eyes blazed red again,  so red that Mother Hare saw them and stopped short. Then Kagax sat up  straight among the dead babies and screeched in her face.    The poor creature never moved a step; she only crouched low before her  own door and began to shiver violently. Kagax ran up to her; raised  himself on his hind legs so as to place his fore paws on her neck;  chose his favorite spot behind the ears, and bit. The hare  straightened out, the quivering ceased. A tiny drop of blood followed  the sharp teeth on either side. Kagax licked it greedily and hurried  away, afraid to spoil his hunt by drinking.    But he had scarcely entered the woods, running heedlessly, when the  moss by a great stone stirred with a swift motion. There was a squeak  of fright as Kagax jumped forward like lightning--but too late.  Tookhees, the timid little wood mouse, who was digging under the moss  for twin-flower roots to feed his little ones, had heard the enemy  coming, and dove headlong into his hole, just in time to escape the  snap of Kagax's teeth.    That angered the fiery little weasel like poking a stick at him. To be  caught napping, or to be heard running through the woods, is more than  he can possibly stand. His eyes fairly snapped as he began digging  furiously. Below, he could hear a chorus of faint squeaks, the clamor  of young wood mice for their supper. But a few inches down, and the  hole doubled under a round stone, then vanished between two roots  close together. Try as he would, Kagax could only wear his claws out,  without making any progress. He tried to force his shoulders through;  for a weasel thinks he can go anywhere. But the hole was too small.  Kagax cried out in rage and took up the trail. A dozen times he ran it  from the hole to the torn moss, where Tookhees had been digging roots,  and back again; then, sure that all the wood mice were inside, he  tried to tear his way between the obstinate roots. As well try to claw  down the tree itself.    All the while Tookhees, who always has just such a turn in his tunnel,  and who knows perfectly when he is safe, crouched just below the  roots, looking up with steady little eyes, like two black beads, at  his savage pursuer, and listening in a kind of dumb terror to his  snarls of rage.    Kagax gave it up at last and took to running in circles. Wider and  wider he went, running swift and silent, his nose to the ground,  seeking other mice on whom to wreak his vengeance. Suddenly he struck  a fresh trail and ran it straight to the clearing where a foolish  field mouse had built a nest in a tangle of dry brakes. Kagax caught  and killed the mother as she rushed out in alarm. Then he tore the  nest open and killed all the little ones. He tasted the blood of one  and went on again.    The failure to catch the wood mouse still rankled in his head and kept  his eyes bright red. Suddenly he turned from his course along the lake  shore; he began to climb the ridge. Up and up he went, crossing a  dozen trails that ordinarily he would have followed, till he came to  where a dead tree had fallen and lodged against a big spruce, near the  summit. There he crouched in the underbrush and waited.    Up near the top of the dead tree, a pair of pine martens had made  their den in the hollow trunk, and reared a family of young martens  that drew Kagax's evil thoughts like a magnet. The marten belongs to  the weasel's own family; therefore, as a choice bit of revenge, Kagax  would rather kill him than anything else. A score of times he had  crouched in this same place and waited for his chance. But the marten  is larger and stronger every way than the weasel, and, though shyer,  almost as savage in a fight. And Kagax was afraid.    But to-night Kagax was in a more vicious mood than ever before; and a  weasel's temper is always the most vicious thing in the woods. He  stole forward at last and put his nose to the foot of the leaning  tree. Two fresh trails went out; none came back. Kagax followed them  far enough to be sure that both martens were away hunting; then he  turned and ran like a flash up the incline and into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#7)"],[1,"Macdonalds, under Angus Og  of Islay.  He wintered in the isle of Rathlin (some think he even went to  Norway), and in spring, after surprising the English garrison in his own  castle of Turnberry, he roamed, now lonely, now with a mobile little  force, in Galloway, always evading and sometimes defeating his English  pursuers.  At Loch Trool and at London Hill (Drumclog) he dealt them  heavy blows, while on June 7, 1307, his great enemy Edward died at  Borough-on-Sands, leaving the crown and the war to the weakling Edward  II.    Fortune had turned.  We cannot follow Bruce through his campaign in the  north, where he ruined the country of the Comyns (1308), and through the  victories in Galloway of his hard-fighting brother Edward.  With enemies  on every side, Bruce took them in detail; early in March 1309 he routed  the Macdowals at the west end of the Pass of Brander.  Edward II. was  involved in disputes with his own barons, and Bruce was recognised by his  country's Church in 1310 and aided by his great lieutenants, Sir James  Douglas and Thomas Randolph, Earl of Murray.  By August 1311 Bruce was  carrying the war into England, sacking Durham and Chester, failing at  Carlisle, but in January 1313, capturing Perth.  In summer, Edward Bruce,  in the spirit of chivalry, gave to Stirling Castle (Randolph had taken  Edinburgh Castle) a set day, Midsummer Day 1314, to be relieved or to  surrender; and Bruce kept tryst with Edward II. and his English and Irish  levies, and all his adventurous chivalry from France, Hainault, Bretagne,  Gascony, and Aquitaine.  All the world knows the story of the first  battle, the Scottish Quatre Bras; the success of Randolph on the right;  the slaying of Bohun when Bruce broke his battle-axe.  Next day Bruce's  position was strong; beneath the towers of Stirling the Bannockburn  protected his front; morasses only to be crossed by narrow paths impeded  the English advance.  Edward Bruce commanded the right wing; Randolph the  centre; Douglas and the Steward the left; Bruce the reserve, the  Islesmen.  His strength lay in his spearmen's \"dark impenetrable wood\";  his archers were ill-trained; of horse he had but a handful under Keith,  the Marischal.  But the heavy English cavalry could not break the squares  of spears; Keith cut up the archers of England; the main body could not  deploy, and the slow, relentless advance of the whole Scottish line  covered the plain with the dying and the flying.  A panic arose, caused  by the sight of an approaching cloud of camp-followers on the Gillie's  hill; Edward fled, and hundreds of noble prisoners, with all the waggons  and supplies of England, fell into the hands of the Scots.  In eight  strenuous years the generalship of Bruce and his war-leaders, the  resolution of the people, hardened by the cruelties of Edward, the  sermons of the clergy, and the utter incompetence of Edward II., had  redeemed a desperate chance.  From a fief of England, Scotland had become  an indomitable nation.        LATER DAYS OF BRUCE.      Bruce continued to prosper, despite an ill-advised attempt to win  Ireland, in which Edward Bruce fell (1318.)  This left the succession, if  Bruce had no male issue, to the children of his daughter, Marjory, and  her husband, the Steward.  In 1318 Scotland recovered Berwick, in 1319  routed the English at Mytton-on-Swale.  In a Parliament at Aberbrothock  (April 6, 1320) the Scots announced to the Pope, who had been  interfering, that, while a hundred of them survive, they will never yield  to England.  In October 1322 Bruce utterly routed the English at Byland  Abbey, in the heart of Yorkshire, and chased Edward II. into York.  In  March 1324 a son was born to Bruce named David; on May 4, 1328, by the  Treaty of Northampton, the independence of Scotland was recognised.  In  July the infant David married Joanna, daughter of Edward II.    On June 7, 1329, Bruce died and was buried at Dunfermline; his heart, by  his order, was carried by Douglas towards the Holy Land, and when Douglas  fell in a battle with the Moors in Spain, the heart was brought back by  Sir Simon Lockhart of the Lee.  The later career of Bruce, after he had  been excommunicated, is that of the foremost knight and most sagacious  man of action who ever wore the crown of Scotland.  The staunchness with  which the clergy and estates disregarded papal fulminations (indeed under  William the Lion they had treated an interdict as waste-paper) indicated  a kind of protestant tendency to independence of the Holy See.    Bruce's inclusion of representatives of the Burghs in the first regular  Scottish Parliament (at Cambuskenneth in 1326) was a great step forward  in the constitutional existence of the country.  The king, in Scotland,  was expected to \"live of his own,\" but in 1326 the expenses of the war  with England compelled Bruce to seek permission for taxation.          CHAPTER IX.  DECADENCE AND DISASTERS--REIGN OF DAVID II.      The heroic generation of Scotland was passing off the stage.  The King  was a child.  The forfeiture by Bruce of the lands of hostile or  treacherous lords, and his bestowal of the estates on his partisans, had  made the disinherited nobles the enemies of Scotland, and had fed too  full the House of Douglas.  As the star of Scotland was thus clouded--she  had no strong man for a King during the next ninety years--the sun of  England rose red and glorious under a warrior like Edward III.  The  Scottish nobles in many cases ceased to be true to their proud boast that  they would never submit to England.  A very brief summary of the wretched  reign of David II. must here suffice.    First, the son of John Balliol, Edward, went to the English Court, and  thither thronged the disinherited and forfeited lords, arranging a raid  to recover their lands.  Edward III., of course, connived at their  preparations.    After Randolph's death (July 20, 1332), when Mar--a sister's son of  Bruce--was Regent, the disinherited lords, under Balliol, invaded  Scotland, and Mar, with young Randolph, Menteith, and a bastard of Bruce,  \"Robert of Carrick,\" leading a very great host, fell under the shafts of  the English archers of Umfraville, Wake, the English Earl of Atholl,  Talbot, Ferrers, and Zouche, at Dupplin, on the Earn (August 12, 1332).  Rolled up by arrows loosed on the flanks of their charging columns, they  fell, and their dead bodies lay in heaps as tall as a lance.    On September 24, Edward Balliol was crowned King at Scone.  Later, Andrew  Murray, perhaps a son of the Murray who had been Wallace's companion-in-  arms, was taken, and Balliol acknowledged Edward III. as his liege-lord  at Roxburgh.  In December the second son of Randolph, with Archibald, the  new Regent, brother of the great Black Douglas, drove Balliol, flying in  his shirt, from Annan across the Border.  He returned, and was opposed by  this Archibald Douglas, called Tineman, the Unlucky, and on July 19,  1333, Tineman suffered, at Halidon Hill, near Berwick, a defeat as  terrible as Flodden; Berwick, too, was lost, practically for ever,  Tineman fell, and Sir William Douglas, the Knight of Liddesdale, was a  prisoner.  These Scots defeats were always due to rash frontal attacks on  strong positions, the assailants passing between lines of English bowmen  who loosed into their flanks.  The boy king, David, was carried to France  (1334) for safety, while Balliol delivered to Edward Berwick and the  chief southern counties, including that of Edinburgh, with their castles.    There followed internal wars between Balliol's partisans, while the  patriots were led by young Randolph, by the young Steward, by Sir Andrew  Murray, and the wavering and cruel Douglas, called the Knight of  Liddesdale, now returned from captivity.  In the desperate state of  things, with Balliol and Edward ravaging Scotland at will, none showed  more resolution than Bruce's sister, who held Kildrummie Castle; and  Randolph's daughter, \"Black Agnes,\" who commanded that of Dunbar.  By  vast gifts Balliol won over John, Lord of the Isles.  The Celts turned to  the English party; Edward III. harried the province of Moray, but, in  1337, he began to undo his successes by formally claiming the crown of  France: France and Scotland together could always throw off the English  yoke.    Thus diverted from Scotland, Edward lost strength there while he warred  with Scotland's ally: in 1341 the Douglas, Knight of Liddesdale,  recovered Edinburgh Castle by a romantic surprise.  But David returned  home in 1341, a boy of eighteen, full of the foibles of chivalry, rash,  sensual, extravagant, who at once gave deadly offence to the Knight of  Liddesdale by preferring to him, as sheriff of Teviotdale, the brave Sir  Alexander Ramsay, who had driven the English from the siege of Dunbar  Castle.  Douglas threw Ramsay into Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale and  starved him to death.    In 1343 the Knight began to intrigue traitorously with Edward III.; after  a truce, David led his whole force into England, where his rash chivalry  caused his utter defeat at Neville's Cross, near Durham (October 17,  1346).  He was taken, as was the Bishop of St Andrews; his ransom became  the central question between England and Scotland.  In 1353 Douglas,  Knight of Liddesdale, was slain at Williamshope on Yarrow by his godson,  William, Lord Douglas: the fact is commemorated in a fragment of perhaps  our oldest narrative Border ballad.  French men-at-arms now helped the  Scots to recover Berwick, merely to lose it again in 1356; in 1357 David  was set free: his ransom, 100,000 merks, was to be paid by instalment.  The country was heavily taxed, but the full sum was never paid.  Meanwhile  the Steward had been Regent; between him, the heir of the Crown failing  issue to David, and the King, jealousies arose.  David was suspected of  betraying the kingdom to England; in October 1363 he and the Earl of  Douglas visited London and"]]]
