He declares that however much his detractors at Rome may reproach him with  inaction, they could not read the numerous difficult works on which he has  been engaged within the same space of time that he has taken to write  them[143].    In the beginning of June Cicero spent a few days at his villa near  Antium[144], where he wrote a treatise addressed to Caesar, which he  afterwards suppressed[145]. From the same place he wrote to Atticus of his  intention to proceed to Tusculum or Rome by way of Lanuvium about the  middle of June[146]. He had in the time immediately following Tullia's  death entertained an aversion for Tusculum, where she died. This he felt  now compelled to conquer, otherwise he must either abandon Tusculum  altogether, or, if he returned at all, a delay of even ten years would make  the effort no less painful[147]. Before setting out for Antium Cicero wrote  to Atticus that he had finished while at Astura _duo magna_ [Greek:  syntagmata], words which have given rise to much controversy[148]. Many  scholars, including Madvig, have understood that the first edition of the  _Academica_, along with the _De Finibus_, is intended. Against this view  the reasons adduced by Krische are convincing[149]. It is clear from the  letters to Atticus that the _De Finibus_ was being worked out book by book  long after the first edition of the _Academica_ had been placed in the  hands of Atticus. The _De Finibus_ was indeed begun at Astura[150], but it  was still in an unfinished state when Cicero began to revise the  _Academica_[151]. The final arrangement of the characters in the _De  Finibus_ is announced later still[152]; and even at a later date Cicero  complains that Balbus had managed to obtain surreptitiously a copy of the  fifth book before it was properly corrected, the irrepressible Caerellia  having copied the whole five books while in that state[153]. A passage in  the _De Divinatione_[154] affords almost direct evidence that the  _Academica_ was published before the _De Finibus_. On all these grounds I  hold that these two works cannot be those which Cicero describes as having  been finished simultaneously at Astura.    Another view of the [Greek: syntagmata] in question is that they are simply  the two books, entitled _Catulus_ and _Lucullus_, of the _Priora  Academica_. In my opinion the word [Greek: syntagma], the use of which to  denote a portion of a work Madvig suspects[155], thus obtains its natural  meaning. Cicero uses the word [Greek: syntaxis] of the whole work[156],  while [Greek: syntagma][157], and [Greek: syngramma][158], designate  definite portions or divisions of a work. I should be quite content, then,  to refer the words of Cicero to the _Catulus_ and _Lucullus_. Krische,  however, without giving reasons, decides that this view is unsatisfactory,  and prefers to hold that the _Hortensius_ (or _de Philosophia_) and the  _Priora Academica_ are the compositions in question. If this conjecture is  correct, we have in the disputed passage the only reference to the  _Hortensius_ which is to be found in the letters of Cicero. We are quite  certain that the book was written at Astura, and published before the  _Academica_. This would be clear from the mention in the _Academica  Posteriora_ alone[159], but the words of Cicero in the _De Finibus_[160]  place it beyond all doubt, showing as they do that the _Hortensius_ had  been published a sufficiently long time before the _De Finibus_, to have  become known to a tolerably large circle of readers. Further, in the  _Tusculan Disputations_ and the _De Divinatione_[161] the _Hortensius_ and  the _Academica_ are mentioned together in such a way as to show that the  former was finished and given to the world before the latter. Nothing  therefore stands in the way of Krische's conjecture, except the doubt I  have expressed as to the use of the word [Greek: syntagma], which equally  affects the old view maintained by Madvig.    Whatever be the truth on this point, it cannot be disputed that the  _Hortensius_ and the _Academica_ must have been more closely connected, in  style and tone, than any two works of Cicero, excepting perhaps the  _Academica_ and the _De Finibus_. The interlocutors in the _Hortensius_  were exactly the same as in the _Academica Priora_, for the introduction of  Balbus into some editions of the fragments of the _Hortensius_ is an  error[162]. The discussion in the _Academica Priora_ is carried on at  Hortensius' villa near Bauli; in the _Hortensius_ at the villa of Lucullus  near Cumae. It is rather surprising that under these circumstances there  should be but one direct reference to the _Hortensius_ in the  _Lucullus_[163].    While at his Tusculan villa, soon after the middle of June, B.C. 45, Cicero  sent Atticus the _Torquatus_, as he calls the first book of the _De  Finibus_[164]. He had already sent the first edition of the _Academica_ to  Rome[165]. We have a mention that new prooemia had been added to the  _Catulus_ and _Lucullus_, in which the public characters from whom the  books took their names were extolled. In all probability the extant  prooemium of the _Lucullus_ is the one which was then affixed. Atticus, who  visited Cicero at Tusculum, had doubtless pointed out the incongruity  between the known attainments of Catulus and Lucullus, and the parts they  were made to take in difficult philosophical discussions. It is not  uncharacteristic of Cicero that his first plan for healing the incongruity  should be a deliberate attempt to impose upon his readers a set of  statements concerning the ability and culture of these two noble Romans  which he knew, and in his own letters to Atticus admitted, to be false. I  may note, as of some interest in connection with the _Academica_, the fact  that among the unpleasant visits received by Cicero at Tusculum was one  from Varro[166].    On the 23rd July, Cicero left Home for Arpinum, in order, as he says, to  arrange some business matters, and to avoid the embarrassing attentions of  Brutus[167]. Before leaving Astura, however, it had been his intention to  go on to Arpinum[168]. He seems to have been still unsatisfied with his  choice of interlocutors for the _Academica_, for the first thing he did on  his arrival was to transfer the parts of Catulus and Lucullus to Cato and  Brutus[169]. This plan was speedily cast aside on the receipt of a letter  from Atticus, strongly urging that the whole work should be dedicated to  Varro, or if not the _Academica_, the _De Finibus_[170]. Cicero had never  been very intimate with Varro: their acquaintance seems to have been  chiefly maintained through Atticus, who was at all times anxious to draw  them more closely together. Nine years before he had pressed Cicero to find  room in his works for some mention of Varro[171]. The nature of the works  on which our author was then engaged had made it difficult to comply with  the request[172]. Varro had promised on his side, full two years before the  _Academica_ was written, to dedicate to Cicero his great work _De Lingua  Latino_. In answer to the later entreaty of Atticus, Cicero declared  himself very much dissatisfied with Varro's failure to fulfil his promise.  From this it is evident that Cicero knew nothing of the scope or magnitude  of that work. His complaint that Varro had been writing for two years  without making any progress[173], shows that there could have been little  of anything like friendship between the two. Apart from these causes for  grumbling, Cicero thought the suggestion of Atticus a \"godsend[174].\" Since  the _De Finibus_ was already \"betrothed\" to Brutus, he promised to transfer  to Varro the _Academica_, allowing that Catulus and Lucullus, though of  noble birth, had no claim to learning[175]. So little of it did they  possess that they could never even have dreamed of the doctrines they had  been made in the first edition of the _Academica_ to maintain[176]. For  them another place was to be found, and the remark was made that the  _Academica_ would just suit Varro, who was a follower of Antiochus, and the  fittest person to expound the opinions of that philosopher[177]. It  happened that continual rain fell during the first few days of Cicero's  stay at Arpinum, so he employed his whole time in editing once more his  _Academica_, which he now divided into four books instead of two, making  the interlocutors himself, Varro and Atticus[178]. The position occupied by  Atticus in the dialogue was quite an inferior one, but he was so pleased  with it that Cicero determined to confer upon him often in the future such  minor parts[179]. A suggestion of Atticus that Cotta should also be  introduced was found impracticable[180].    Although the work of re-editing was vigorously pushed on, Cicero had  constant doubts about the expediency of dedicating the work to Varro. He  frequently throws the whole responsibility for the decision upon Atticus,  but for whose importunities he would probably again have changed his plans.  Nearly every letter written to Atticus during the progress of the work  contains entreaties that he would consider the matter over and over again  before he finally decided[181]. As no reasons had been given for these  solicitations, Atticus naturally grew impatient, and Cicero was obliged to  assure him that there were reasons, which he could not disclose in a  letter[182]. The true reasons, however, did appear in some later letters.  In one Cicero said: \"I am in favour of Varro, and the more so because he  wishes it, but you know he is      [Greek: deinos aner, tacha ken kai anaition aitiooito.]    So there often flits before me a vision of his face, as he grumbles, it may  be, that my part in the treatise is more liberally sustained than his; a  charge which you will perceive to be untrue[183].\" Cicero, then, feared  Varro's temper, and perhaps his knowledge and real critical fastidiousness.  Before these explanations Atticus had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14976"],[0,"Mob Rule in New Orleans (#7)"],[1,"was copper colored, about 5 feet 11 inches in height,    about 35 years of age, and was dressed in blue overalls and a brown    slouch hat. At 10:30 o'clock the vicinity of the French Market was very    quiet. Squads of special officers were patrolling the neighborhood, and    there did not seem to be any prospects of disorder.    During the entire time the mob held the city in its hands and went about  holding up street cars and searching them, taking from them colored men to  assault, shoot and kill, chasing colored men upon the public square,  through alleys and into houses of anybody who would take them in, breaking  into the homes of defenseless colored men and women and beating aged and  decrepit men and women to death, the police and the legally constituted  authorities showed plainly where their sympathies were, for in no case  reported through the daily papers does there appear the arrest, trial and  conviction of one of the mob for any of the brutalities which occurred.  The ringleaders of the mob were at no time disguised. Men were chased,  beaten and killed by white brutes, who boasted of their crimes, and the  murderers still walk the streets of New Orleans, well known and absolutely  exempt from prosecution. Not only were they exempt from prosecution by the  police while the town was in the hands of the mob, but even now that law  and order is supposed to resume control, these men, well known, are not  now, nor ever will be, called to account for the unspeakable brutalities  of that terrible week. On the other hand, the colored men who were beaten  by the police and dragged into the station for purposes of intimidation,  were quickly called up before the courts and fined or sent to jail upon  the statement of the police. Instances of Louisiana justice as it is  dispensed in New Orleans are here quoted from the _Times-Democrat_ of July  26:      +Justice Dealt Out to Folk Who Talked Too Much+      All the Negroes and whites who were arrested in the vicinity of    Tuesday's tragedy had a hard time before Recorder Hughes yesterday. Lee    Jackson was the first prisoner, and the evidence established that he    made his way to the vicinity of the crime and told his Negro friends    that he thought a good many more policemen ought to be killed. Jackson    said he was drunk when he made the remark. He was fined $25 or thirty    days.      John Kennedy was found wandering about the street Tuesday night with an    open razor in his hand, and he was given $25 or thirty days.      Edward McCarthy, a white man, who arrived only four days since from New    York, went to the scene of the excitement at the corner of Third and    Rampart Streets, and told the Negroes that they were as good as any    white man. This remark was made by McCarthy, as another white man said    the Negroes should be lynched. McCarthy told the recorder that he    considered a Negro as good as a white in body and soul. He was fined $25    or thirty days.      James Martin, Simon Montegut, Eddie McCall, Alex Washington and Henry    Turner were up for failing to move on. Martin proved that he was at the    scene to assist the police and was discharged. Montegut, being a    cripple, was also released, but the others were fined $25 or thirty days    each.      Eddie Williams for refusing to move on was given $25 or thirty days.      Matilda Gamble was arrested by the police for saying that two officers    were killed and it was a pity more were not shot. She was given $25 or    thirty days.      +INSOLENT BLACKS+    \"Recorder Hughes received Negroes in the first recorder's office yesterday  morning in a way that they will remember for a long time, and all of them  were before the magistrate for having caused trouble through incendiary  remarks concerning the death of Captain Day and Patrolman Lamb.\"    \"Lee Jackson was before the recorder and was fined $25 or thirty days. He  was lippy around where the trouble happened Tuesday morning, and some  white men punched him good and hard and the police took him. Then the  recorder gave him a dose, and now he is in the parish prison.\"    \"John Kennedy was another black who got into trouble. He said that the  shooting of the police by Charles was a good thing, and for this he was  pounded. Patrolman Lorenzo got him and saved him from being lynched, for  the black had an open razor. He was fined $25 or thirty days.\"    \"Edward McCarthy, a white man, mixed up with the crowd, and an expression  of sympathy nearly cost him his head, for some whites about started for  him, administering licks and blows with fists and umbrellas. The recorder  fined him $25 or thirty days. He is from New York.\"    \"Then James Martin, a white man, and Simon Montegut, Eddie Call, Henry  Turner and Alex Washington were before the magistrate for having failed to  move on when the police ordered them from the square where the bluecoats  were Tuesday, waiting in the hope of catching Charles. All save Martin and  Montegut were fined.\"    \"Eddie Williams, a little Negro who was extremely fresh with the police,  was fined $10 or ten days.\"      +SHOCKING BRUTALITY+    The whole city was at the mercy of the mob and the display of brutality  was a disgrace to civilization. One instance is described in the  _Picayune_ as follows:      A smaller party detached itself from the mob at Washington and Rampart    Streets, and started down the latter thoroughfare. One of the foremost    spied a Negro, and immediately there was a rush for the unfortunate    black man. With the sticks they had torn from fences on the line of    march the young outlaws attacked the black and clubbed him unmercifully,    acting more like demons than human beings. After being severely beaten    over the head, the Negro started to run with the whole gang at his    heels. Several revolvers were brought into play and pumped their lead at    the refugee. The Negro made rapid progress and took refuge behind the    blinds of a little cottage in Rampart Street, but he had been seen, and    the mob hauled him from his hiding place and again commenced beating    him. There were more this time, some twenty or thirty, all armed with    sticks and heavy clubs, and under their incessant blows the Negro could    not last long. He begged for mercy, and his cries were most pitiful, but    a mob has no heart, and his cries were only answered with more blows.      \"For God's sake, boss, I ain't done nothin'. Don't kill me. I swear I    ain't done nothin'.\"      The white brutes turned    +  A DEAF EAR TO THE PITYING CRIES+      of the black wretch and the drubbing continued. The cries subsided into    moans, and soon the black swooned away into unconsciousness. Still not    content with their heartless work, they pulled the Negro out and kicked    him into the gutter. For the time those who had beaten the black seemed    satisfied and left him groaning in the gutter, but others came up, and,    regretting that they had not had a hand in the affair, they determined    to evidence their bravery to their fellows and beat the man while he was    in the gutter, hurling rocks and stones at his black form. One    thoughtless white brute, worse even than the black slayer of the police    officers, thought to make himself a hero in the eyes of his fellows and    fired his revolver repeatedly into the helpless wretch. It was dark and    the fellow probably aimed carelessly. After firing three or four shots    he also left without knowing what extent of injury he inflicted on the    black wretch who was left lying in the gutter.        +MURDER ON THE LEVEE+      One part of the crowd made a raid on the tenderloin district, hoping to  find there some belated Negro for a sacrifice. They were urged on by the  white prostitutes, who applauded their murderous mission. Says an account:      The red light district was all excitement. Women--that is, the white    women--were out on their stoops and peeping over their galleries and    through their windows and doors, shouting to the crowd to go on with    their work, and kill Negroes for them.      \"Our best wishes, boys,\" they encouraged; and the mob answered with    shouts, and whenever a Negro house was sighted a bombardment was started    on the doors and windows.    No colored men were found on the streets until the mob reached Custom  House Place and Villiers Streets. Here a victim was found and brutally put  to death. The _Picayune_ description is as follows:      Some stragglers had run a Negro into a car at the corner of Bienville    and Villere Streets. He was seeking refuge in the conveyance, and he    believed that the car would not be stopped and could speed along. But    the mob determined to stop the car, and ordered the motorman to halt. He    put on his brake. Some white men were in the car.      \"Get out, fellows,\" shouted several of the mob.      \"All whites fall out,\" was the second cry, and the poor Negro understood    that it was meant that he should stay in the car.      He wanted to save his life. The poor fellow crawled under the seats. But    some one in the crowd saw him and yelled that he was hiding. Two or    three men climbed through the windows with their pistols; others jumped    over the motorman's board, and dozens tumbled into the rear of the car.    Big, strong hands got the Negro by the shirt. He was dragged out of the    conveyance, and was pushed to the street. Some fellow ran up and struck    him with a club. The blow was heavy, but it did not fell him, and the    Negro ran toward Canal Street, stealing along the wall of the Tulane    Medical Building. Fifty men ran after him, caught the poor fellow and    hurried him back into the crowd. Fists were aimed at him, then clubs    went upon his shoulders, and finally the black plunged into the gutter.      A gun was fired, and the Negro, who had just gotten to his feet, dropped    again. He tried to get up, but a volley was sent after him, and in a    little"]]]
