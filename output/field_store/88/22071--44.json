I have the whole history of  Tessier's life and how he made his fortune. There is a family for the  use of whom we must give at least a million, for the fortune of Tessier  was not his alone. He had a companion who shared his troubles and his  work. According to the will they were to inherit one from the other; the  companion died, and Tessier inherited everything. I do not see the  necessity of your trip to New York; that might make noise and perhaps  delay my negotiations.\" Then follows the list of properties embraced in  the inheritance:    PROPERTY AND PERSONAL ESTATE OF THE HEIRS    1   The land of Central Park ceded to the      city of New York, of the value of             $5,000,000.00    2   He had at the National Bank--United      States Bank--deposited in gold--twenty      to thirty million dollars.

The letters continue: The General is surrounded by enemies, of which the  worst are French, and he is forced continually to change his residence  in order to escape their machinations. But all this takes money. How can  he go to Tuxpan or to the city of Coney Island? \"You cannot know nor  imagine the expense which I have had to discover that which I have  discovered. I cannot live here like a miser, for the part I represent  demands much of me. Every moment I change my residence, and that costs  money.\" He adds a little touch of detail. \"I must always be dressed  properly, and laundry is very dear here--a shirt costs twenty-five cents  to wash, and there are other necessary expenses.... You have forgotten  to tell me if you have received the album of views of New York in which  I have indicated the properties of the deceased, I squeeze your hand.\"    \"Yes, and our purses too,\" adds Madame Valoie. \"Would M'sieu' care to  see the album of the Tessier properties? Yes? M'sieu' Lapierre, kindly  show the gentleman.\"    Lapierre unbuttons his homespun coat and produces a cheap paper-covered  blank book in which are pasted small photographs and woodcuts of various  well-known New York buildings. It is hard not to smile.    \"M'sieu' will see,\" continues Madame Valoie, \"that the dream had  something substantial about it. When we saw these pictures in Bordeaux  we were on the point of giving up in despair, but the pictures convinced  us that it was all true. Moreover, just at that time the General  intimated that unless he had more money he might yield to the efforts of  the Lespinasse family to buy him off.\"    Madame Valoie points vindictively to a certain paragraph in one of the  letters: \"Of course they are convinced that I am not for sale, not for  anything.... To my regret, my very great regret, I shall be forced to  capitulate if you do not come to my aid and that quickly, for I repeat  to you that my funds are all gone.\"    \"And here is his bill,\" continues Madame Valoie, producing a folded  document composed of countless sheets of very thin paper, bound  together at the edges by strips of heavier material. This, when  unfolded, stretches entirely across the room and is seen to be composed  of hundreds of typewritten items, of which the following may serve as  illustrations:                  EXPENSES IN NEW YORK    July 12, Train to New Orleans   ..........   $25.50  \"    16, Train to Florida       ...........  $ 2.50  \"     \"  Dinner on train        ...........  $ 2.00  \"    17, Hotel in Florida       ...........  $ 2.00  \"    18, Trip to Coney Island   ...........  $  .50  \"    19, Return to Florida      ...........  $  .50  \"    21, Return from Florida to New Orleans  $ 2.50  \"     \"    Laundry              ...........  $ 1.15  Dec.  3, Return to New York     ...........  $ 6.50  \"    24, Train to Vera Cruz     ...........  $57.50  Jan.  4, Trip to Tuxpan         ...........  $ 2.50  \"     5, Return to Vera Cruz    ...........  $ 2.50  \"     6, Sudden night trip to Halifax,           Nova Scotia, via Buffalo and           Niagara Falls          ...........  $50.50  \"    18, Laundry for three months .........  $ 5.00            Etc., etc.                  EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES    To Agent Pushyt John, a meerschaum and amber      cigar-holder and pipe       ...........  $ 7.00  Tobacco jar of shell and silver ...........  $ 4.00  To Indian Peter South-Go, a watch, a suit,      and a pair of shoes         ...........  $16.50  To my general agent of confidential reports      for his daughter, a gold ring and a      feather fan                 ...........  $ 7.00  A necktie for himself and scarf pin in      gold and with stone for the necktie ...  $ 8.60  To the letter-carrier to bring me my      correspondence and not give it to any      one else when I should change address .  $ 4.00  Invitation to the Consul and his two      agents in Washington hotel  ...........  $12.00  Several invitations to cafes and saloons      to the Police Agents        ...........  $ 2.00  Invitations to old employees of Jean      Tessier, to tear from them the      declarations                ...........  $ 1.50  Barber expenses                 ...........  $11.50  Tobacco and matches, July to December,      three packages each week, ten cents      each                        ...........  $ 7.80  Changing hotels to lead astray the agents      of the impostors            ...........  $ 9.50            Etc., etc.      \"To obtain a collossal fortune as yours will be, it is necessary to  spend money unstintingly and to have lots of patience. Court proceedings  will be useless, as trickery and lies are necessary to get the best of  the scoundrels. It is necessary also to be a scoundrel.\"    \"That he might well say,\" interpolates Lapierre. \"He succeed, _c'est  sure_.\"    I rapidly glanced over the remaining letters. The General seems always  to be upon the verge of compelling a compromise. \"I have already  prepared my net and the meshes are tightly drawn so that the fish will  not be able to escape.... For an office like this one needs money--money  to go quickly from one place to another, prosecute the usurpers, not  allow them an instant's rest. If they go to some city run after them at  once, tire them with my presence and constantly harass them, and by this  means compel them to hasten a compromise--\"    The General is meeting with superhuman obstacles. In addition to his  enemies he suffers all sorts of terrible bodily afflictions. Whenever  the remittances from the Lapierres do not arrive the difficulties and  diseases increase.    At last, however, after an interval of two years, things took a turn for  the better. A \"confidential representative\" of the conspirators--one  \"Mr. Benedict-Smith\"--arrived to make a bona fide offer of one hundred  and fifty million dollars in settlement of the case. The General writes  at great length as to exactly in what proportion the money should be  divided among the heirs. The thing is so near a culmination that he is  greatly exercised over his shabby appearance.        I am without a son and too badly dressed to go before the banker in      the very likely case of his arrival here.

This pudding can be eaten warm or cold, but is much better  cold. This will serve four persons generously.      CHOCOLATE ALMONDS    Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water on them, and let them stand  two or three minutes. Roast them in oven. Dip them in the following  recipe for chocolate coating, and drop on paraffine paper.        1/2 pound cake of Walter Baker's Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,      2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water.    Put chocolate in small saucepan over boiling water and when melted stir  in butter and water. Mix well. If found to be too thick, add more water;  if too thin, more chocolate.      HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE        1 cup of boiling water,      Pinch of salt,      1 square of chocolate,      1/2 a cup of sugar.    Cook all together slowly until it is the consistency of maple syrup, or  thicker if desired. Just before serving, add one teaspoonful of vanilla.  This will keep indefinitely, and can be reheated.      COCOA SPONGE CAKE        4 eggs,      1/4 a cup of sugar,      Pinch of salt,      4 tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      1/2 a cup of sifted pastry flour,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Separate yolks from whites of eggs; beat yolks in a small bowl with the  Dover egg-beater until very thick; add sugar, salt and vanilla, and beat  again until very thick. Sift cocoa and the flour together and stir very  lightly into the mixture; fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs,  and bake in a loaf in a moderate oven until done.    Do not butter the pan, but when cake is baked, invert the pan; and when  cool, remove the cake.      CHOCOLATE FROSTING        1 square of Baker's Chocolate,      Pinch of salt,      5 tablespoonfuls of boiling water,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      About three cups of sifted confectioners' sugar.    Melt chocolate in bowl over tea-kettle, add water, salt and vanilla, and  when smooth add the sugar, and heat until very glossy. Make the frosting  stiff enough to spread without using a wet knife. It will keep  indefinitely.      CHOCOLATE CAKE, OR DEVIL'S FOOD        5 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      1-1/4 cups of sugar,      3-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate, (melted),      3 eggs,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      3/4 a cup of milk,      3-1/2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,      1-1/2 cups of sifted pastry flour.    Cream the butter, add sugar and chocolate, then the unbeaten eggs and  vanilla, and beat together until very smooth. Sift the baking powder  with one-half a cup of the flour, and use first; then alternate the milk  and the remaining flour, and make the mixture stiff enough to drop from  the spoon. Beat until very smooth and bake in loaf in moderate oven. For  tests see Cocoa Cake recipe on page 25.      CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM        1 quart of milk,      Pinch of salt,      3 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      3 level tablespoonfuls of flour,      1 can of sweetened condensed milk,      3 eggs,      6 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      3 teaspoonfuls of vanilla.    Put milk, salt and chocolate in double-boiler, and when milk is hot and  chocolate has melted, stir in the flour, previously mixed in a little  cold milk. Cook ten minutes, then pour this over the condensed milk,  eggs and sugar mixed together; cook again for four minutes, stirring.  Strain, and when cool add vanilla, and freeze.      CHOCOLATE WHIP        1 cup of milk,      1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      Pinch of salt,      2 level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,      2 eggs (yolks),      6 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla,      5 eggs (whites).    Put milk, chocolate and salt in double-boiler; mix cornstarch in a small  quantity of cold milk, and stir into the hot milk when the chocolate has  been melted; stir until smooth, then cook twelve minutes. Mix together  the yolks of the eggs and sugar, then pour the hot mixture over it; cook  again one or two minutes, stirring. When very cold, just before serving,  add the vanilla and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Pile  lightly in a glass dish and serve with lady fingers. A meringue can be  made of the whites of the eggs and sugar, then folded in the chocolate  mixture, but it does not stand as long.      COCOA MARBLE CAKE        6 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      1 cup of granulated sugar,      3 eggs,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      3/4 a cup of milk.    Three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, about one and three-quarter  cups of sifted flour, or flour enough to make mixture stiff enough to  drop from the spoon. Mix in the order given. Reserve one-third of this  mixture and add to it four level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa and to  the other one cup of shredded cocoanut. Bake thirty-five or forty  minutes according to size and shape of pan.      CHOCOLATE MARBLE CAKE    This is the same as the Cocoa Marble Cake. Add to one-third of the  mixture one and one-half squares of Baker's Chocolate in place of the  cocoa, and one cup of chopped walnuts to the other part in place of the  shredded cocoanut.      CHOCOLATE JELLY        1 pint of boiling water,      1/3 a package of gelatine,      2 pinches of salt,      2 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Put the water, salt and chocolate in a saucepan. Cook, stirring until  the chocolate melts, then let it boil for three or five minutes. Soften  the gelatine in a little cold water and pour the boiling mixture over  it. Stir until dissolved, then add sugar and vanilla. Pour into a mould  and set aside to harden, serve with cream and powdered sugar or  sweetened whipped cream.      COTTAGE PUDDING        4 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      2 eggs,      1 cup of sugar,      3/4 a cup of milk.    Two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one and three-quarter cups of  sifted flour or enough to make mixture stiff enough to drop from the  spoon. Bake in buttered gem pans in moderately hot oven twenty-three or  twenty-five minutes. If the cake springs back after pressing a finger on  the top, it shows that it is baked enough. To make a cocoa cottage  pudding add to the above rule six level tablespoonfuls of cocoa. Serve  with a vanilla sauce.      VANILLA SAUCE        2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      1 cup of boiling water,      2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,      4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      Pinch of salt,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Melt butter in saucepan, add flour and salt and mix until smooth; add  slowly the boiling water, stirring and beating well. Add sugar and milk.      COCOANUT SOUFFLE        1 cup of milk,      1 pinch of salt,      3 level tablespoonfuls of flour, softened in a little cold milk.      2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      Yolks of 4 eggs,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      1 cup of shredded cocoanut,      Whites of 4 eggs.    Heat milk, add salt and flour and cook ten minutes after it has  thickened. Mix together, butter, sugar and yolks of eggs. Pour hot  mixture over, stirring well and set aside to cool. Add vanilla and  cocoanut. Lastly fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in  buttered pan, in moderate oven until firm. Serve hot with Chocolate  Sauce.      CHOCOLATE SAUCE        2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      1 level tablespoonful of flour,      Pinch of salt,      1 cup of boiling water,      1 square of Baker's Chocolate,      4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Melt butter in saucepan, add dry flour and salt and mix until smooth,  then add slowly the hot water, beating well. Add the square of chocolate  and sugar and stir until melted. Add vanilla, just before serving.      COCOA BISCUIT        2 cups or 1 pint of sifted flour,      3 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,      1/2 a teaspoonful of salt,      2 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      4 level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      2 level tablespoonfuls of butter or lard,      2/3 a cup of milk or enough to make a firm but not a stiff dough.    Sift all the dry ingredients together, rub in the butter with the tips  of the fingers. Stir in the required amount of milk. Turn out on  slightly floured board, roll or pat out the desired thickness, place  close together in pan and bake in very hot oven ten or fifteen minutes.      COCOA FUDGE    [Illustration: COCOA FUDGE.]        1/2 a cup of milk,      3 level tablespoonfuls of butter,      2-1/2 cups of powdered sugar,      6 tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      Pinch of salt,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Mix all ingredients together but vanilla; cook, stirring constantly,  until it begins to boil, then cook slowly, stirring occasionally, eight  or ten minutes, or until it makes a firm ball when dropped in cold  water. When cooked enough, add the vanilla and beat until it seems like  very cold molasses in winter. Pour into a buttered pan; when firm, cut  in squares. Great care must be taken not to beat too much, because it  cannot be poured into the pan, and will not have a gloss on top.          Miss M.E. Robinson's Recipes      PLAIN CHOCOLATE        1 ounce or square of Baker's Premium Chocolate,      3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,      1/8 a teaspoonful of salt,      1 pint of boiling water,      1 pint of milk.    Place the chocolate, sugar and salt in the agate chocolate-pot or  saucepan, add the boiling water and boil three minutes, stirring once or  twice, as the chocolate is not grated. Add the milk and allow it time to  heat, being careful not to boil the milk, and keep it closely covered,  as this prevents the scum from forming. When ready to serve turn in  chocolate-pitcher and beat with Dover egg-beater until light and foamy.      COCOA DOUGHNUTS    One egg, one-half a cup of sugar, one-half a cup "]]]
