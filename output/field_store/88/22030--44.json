At the  end, when he had determined by sending out birds that the waters  had subsided, he went forth from the ark and reared an altar and  offered sacrifice to Jehovah of every clean beast and bird.    The other and more detailed account is apparently the sequel of the  late priestly narratives found in Genesis 1 and 5.  The style is  that of a legal writer--formal, exact and repetitious.  In this  account only two of each kind of beast and bird are taken into the  ark.  The flood lasts for over a year and is universal, covering  even the tops of the highest mountains.  No animals are sacrificed,  for according to the priestly writer this custom was first  instituted by Moses.  When the flood subsides, however, a covenant  is concluded and is sealed by the rainbow in accordance with which  man's commission to rule over all other living things is renewed  and divine permission is given to each to eat of the flesh of  animals, provided only that men carefully abstain from eating the  blood.  This later account is dated by this group of modern  Biblical scholars about 400 B.C.      II.    THE CORRESPONDING BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORIES.    Closely parallel to these two variant Biblical accounts of the  flood are the two Babylonian versions, which have fortunately been  almost wholly recovered.  The older Babylonian account is found in  the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh epic, which comes from the  library of Asshurbanipal.  This great conqueror lived  contemporaneously with Manasseh during whose reign Assyrian  influence was paramount in the kingdom of Judah.  In his quest for  healing and immortality Gilgamesh reached the abode of the  Babylonian hero of the flood.  In response to Gilgamesh's question  as to how he, a mortal, attained immortality the Babylonian Noah  recounts the story of the flood.  It was brought about by the  Babylonian gods in order to destroy the city of Shurippak, situated  on the banks of the Euphrates.  The god Ea gave the warning to his  worshipper, the hero of the flood, and commanded him:      Construct a house, build a ship,    Leave goods, look after life,    Forsake possessions, and save life,    Cause all kinds of living things to go up into the ship.    The ship which thou shalt build,--    Exact shall be its dimensions:    Its breadth shall equal its length;    On the great deep launch it.    I understood and said to Ea, my lord:    \"Behold, my lord, what thou hast commanded,    I have reverently received and will carry out.\"    A detailed account then follows of the building of the ark.  Its  dimensions were one hundred and twenty cubits in each direction.  It was built in six stories, each of which was divided into nine  parts.  Plentiful provisions were next carried on board and a great  feast was held to commemorate the completion of the ark.  After  carrying on board his treasures of silver and gold he adds:      All the living creatures of all kinds I loaded on it.    I brought on board my family and household;    Cattle of the field, beasts of the field, the craftsmen,    All of them I brought on board.    In the evening at the command of the god Shamash the rains began to  descend.  Then the Babylonian Noah entered the ship and closed the  door and entrusted the great house with its contents to the  captain.  The description of the tempest that follows is  exceedingly vivid and picturesque.      When the first light of dawn shone forth,    There rose from the horizon a dark cloud, within which Adad thundered,    Nabu and Marduk marched at the front,    The heralds passed over mountains and land;    Nergal tore out the ship's mast,    Ninib advanced, following up the attack,    The spirits of earth raised torches,    With their sheen they lighted up the world.    Adad's tempest reached to heaven,    And all light was changed to darkness.    So great was the havoc wrought by the storm that    The gods bowed down, sat there weeping,    Close pressed together were their lips.    For six days and nights the storm raged, but on the seventh day it  subsided and the flood began to abate.  Of the race of mortals,  however, every voice was hushed.  At last the ship approached the  mountain Nisir which lay on the northern horizon, as viewed from  the Tigris-Euphrates valley.  Here the ship grounded.  Then,      When the seventh day arrived,    I sent forth a dove and let it loose,    The dove went forth, but came back;    Because it found no resting-place, it returned:    Then I sent forth a swallow, but it came back;    Because it found no resting-place, it returned.    Then I sent forth a raven and let it loose,    The raven went forth and saw that the waters had decreased;    It fed, it waded, it croaked, but did not return.    Then I sent forth everything in all directions, and offered a sacrifice,    I made an offering of incense on the highest peak of the mountain,    Seven and seven bowls I placed there,    And over them I poured out calamus, cedar wood and fragrant herbs.    The gods inhaled the odor,    The gods inhaled the sweet odor,    The gods gathered like flies above the sacrifice.    At the intercession of Ea, the Babylonian Noah and his wife were  granted immortality and permitted \"to dwell in the distance at the  confluence of the streams.\"    A later version of the same Babylonian flood story is quoted by  Eusebius from the writings of the Chaldean priest Berossus who  lived about the fourth century B.C.  According to this version the  god Kronos appeared in a dream to Xisuthros, the hero, who, like  Noah in the priestly account, was the last of the ten ancient  Babylonian kings.  At the command of the god he built a great ship  fifteen stadia long and two in width.  Into this he took not only  his family and provisions, but quadrupeds and birds of all kinds.  When the flood began to recede, he sent out a bird, which quickly  returned.  After a few days he sent forth another bird, which  returned with mud on its feet.  When the third bird failed to  return, he took off the cover of the ship and found that it had  stranded on a mountain of Armenia.  The mountain in the Biblical  account is identified with Mount Ararat.  Disembarking, the  Babylonian Noah kissed the earth and, after building an altar,  offered a sacrifice to the gods.    Thus the variations between the older and later Babylonian accounts  of the flood correspond in general to those that have been already  noted in the Biblical versions.  Which Biblical account does the  earliest Babylonian narrative resemble most closely?  In what  details do they agree?  Are these coincidences merely accidental or  do they point possibly to a common tradition?  How far do the later  Biblical and Babylonian accounts agree?  What is the significance  of these points of agreement?      III.    HISTORY OF THE BIBLICAL FLOOD STORIES.    On the basis of the preceding comparisons some writers attempt to  trace tentatively the history of the flood tradition current among  the peoples of southwestern Asia.  A fragment of the Babylonian  flood story, coming from at least as early as 2000 B.C., has  recently been discovered.  The probability is that the tradition  goes back to the earliest beginnings of Babylonian history.  The  setting of the Biblical accounts of the flood is also the  Tigris-Euphrates valley rather than Palestine.  The description of  the construction of the ark in Genesis 6:14-16 is not only closely  parallel to that found in the Babylonian account, but the  method--the smearing of the ark within and without with bitumen--is  peculiar to the Tigris-Euphrates valley.  Many scholars believe,  therefore, that Babylonia was the original home of the Biblical  flood story.    Its exact origin, however, is not so certain.  Many of its details  were doubtless suggested by the annual floods and fogs which  inundate that famous valley and recall the primeval chaos so  vividly pictured in the corresponding Babylonian story of the  creation.  It may have been based on the remembrances of a great  local inundation, possibly due to the subsidence of great areas of  land.  In the earliest Hebrew records there is no trace of this  tradition, although it may have been known to the Aramean ancestors  of the Hebrews.  The literary evidence, however, suggests that it  was first brought to Palestine by the Assyrians.  During the  reactionary reign of Manasseh, Assyrian customs and Baylonian  ideas, which these conquerors had inherited, inundated Judah.  Even  in the temple at Jerusalem the Babylonians' gods, the host of  heaven, were worshipped by certain of the Hebrews.  The few  literary inscriptions which come from this period, those found in  the mound at Gezer, are written in the Assyrian script and contain  the names of Assyrian officials.    Later when the Jewish exiles were carried to Babylonia, they  naturally came into contact again with the Babylonian account of  the flood, but in its later form, as the comparisons already  instituted clearly indicate.  It is thus possible, these scholars  believe, to trace, in outline at least, the literary history of the  Semitic flood story in its various transformations through a period  of nearly two thousand years.      IV.    AIM OF THE BIBLICAL WRITERS IN RECOUNTING THE FLOOD STORY.    The practical question which at once suggests itself is, What place  or right has this ancient Semitic tradition, if such it is, among  the Biblical narratives?  At best the historical data which it  preserves are exceedingly small and of doubtful value.  Is it  possible that the prophetic and priestly historians found these  stories on the lips of the people and sought in this heroic way to  divest them of their polytheistic form and, in certain respects,  immoral implications?  A minute comparison of the Babylonian and  Biblical accounts indicates that this may perhaps be precisely what  has been done; but the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#7)"],[1,"the hill like a five per cent. grade. He  goes a mile to get ten feet higher.\"    \"This fact,\" said Byrne, and he rubbed his chin thoughtfully, \"is not  without interest, though I fail to perceive the relation between me and  such a creature, unless, perhaps, there are biologic similarities of  which I have at present no cognition.\"    \"I didn't think you'd follow me,\" replied Buck with an equal gravity.  \"But you can lay to this, Doc; this gent we're waitin' for ain't  committed any more crimes than a wolf has.\"    \"Ah, I see,\" murmured the doctor, \"a man so near the brute that his  enormities pass beyond--\"    \"Get this straight,\" said Buck, interrupting with a sternly pointed  finger: \"There ain't a kinder or a gentler man in the mountain-desert  than him. He's got a voice softer than Kate Cumberland's, which is some  soft voice, and as for his heart--Doc, I've seen him get off his horse  to put a wounded rabbit out of its pain!\"    A ring of awe came in the throat of Daniels as he repeated the  incredible fact.    He went on: \"If I was in trouble, I'd rather have him beside me than ten  other men; if I was sick I'd rather have him than the ten best doctors  in the world; if I wanted a pal that would die for them that done him  good and go to hell to get them that done him bad, I'd choose him first,  and there ain't none that come second.\"    The panegyric was not a burst of imagination. Buck Daniels was speaking  seriously, hunting for words, and if he used superlatives it was because  he needed them.    \"Extraordinary!\" murmured the doctor, and he repeated the word in a  louder tone. It was a rare word for him; in all his scholastic career  and in all of his scientific investigations he had found occasion to use  so strong a term not more than half a dozen times at the most. He went  on, cautiously, and his weak eyes blinked at Daniels: \"And there is a  relation between this man and a horse and dog?\"    Buck Daniels shuddered and his colour changed.    \"Listen!\" he said, \"I've talked enough. You ain't going to get another  word out of me except this: Doc, have a good sleep, get on your hoss  to-morrow mornin', and beat it. Don't even wait for breakfast. Because,  if you _do_ wait, you may get a hand in this little hell of ours. You  may be waiting, too!\" A sudden thought brought him to his feet. He stood  over the doctor. \"How many times,\" he thundered, \"have you seen Kate  Cumberland?\"    \"To-day, for the first time.\"    \"Well,\" said Daniels, growling with relief, \"you've seen her enough. I  _know_.\" And he turned towards the door. \"Unlock,\" he commanded. \"I'm  tired out--and sick--of talking about _him_.\"    But the doctor did not move.    \"Nevertheless,\" he stated, \"you will remain. There is something further  which you know and which you will communicate to me.\"    Buck Daniels turned at the door; his face was not pleasant.    \"While observing you as you talked with the girl,\" Byrne said, \"it  occurred to me that you were holding information from her. The exact  nature of that information I cannot state, but it is reasonable to  deduce that you could, at the present moment, name the place where the  man for whom Mr. Cumberland and his daughter wait is now located.\"    Buck Daniels made no reply, but he returned to his chair and slumped  heavily into it, staring at the little doctor. And Byrne realised with a  thrill of pleasure that he was not afraid of death.    \"I may further deduct,\" said the doctor, \"that you will go in person to  the place where you know this man may be found and induce him to come to  this ranch.\"    The silent anger of Daniels died away. He smiled, and at length he  laughed without mirth.    \"Doc,\" he said, \"if you knew where there was a gun, would that make you  want to put it up agin your head and pull the trigger?\"    But the doctor proceeded inexorably with his deductions: \"Because you  are aware, Mr. Daniels, that the presence of this man may save the life  of Mr. Cumberland, a thought, to be sure, which might not be accepted by  the medical fraternity, but which may without undue exaggeration  devolve from the psychological situation in this house.\"    \"Doc,\" said Daniels huskily, \"you talk straight, and you act straight,  and I think you are straight, so I'll take off the bridle and talk free.  I know where Whistling Dan is--just about. But if I was to go to him and  bring him here I'd bust the heart of Kate Cumberland. D'you understand?\"  His voice lowered with an intense emotion. \"I've thought it out sideways  and backwards. It's Kate or old Joe. Which is the most important?\"    The doctor straightened in the chair, polished his glasses, and peered  once more at the cowpuncher.    \"You are quite sure, also, that the return of this man, this strange  wanderer, might help Mr. Cumberland back to health?\"    \"I am, all right. He's sure wrapped up in Whistlin' Dan.\"    \"What is the nature of their relations; what makes him so oddly  dependent upon the other?\"    \"I dunno, doc. It's got us all fooled. When Dan is here it seems like  old Cumberland jest nacherally lives on the things Dan does and hears  and sees. We've seen Cumberland prick up his ears the minute Dan comes  into the room, and show life. Sometimes Dan sits with him and tells him  what he's been doin'--maybe it ain't any more than how the sky looks  that day, or about the feel of the wind--but Joe sits with his eyes  dreamin', like a little kid hearin' fairy stories. Kate says it's been  that way since her dad first brought Dan in off'n the range. He's been  sort of necessary to old Joe--almost like air to breathe. I tell you,  it's jest a picture to see them two together.\"    \"Very odd, very odd,\" brooded the doctor, frowning, \"but this seems to  be an odd place and an odd set of people. You've no real idea why Dan  left the ranch?\"    \"Ask the wild geese,\" said Buck bitterly. He added: \"Maybe you'd better  ask Dan's black hoss or his dog, Bart. They'd know better'n anything  else.\"    \"But what has the man been doing since he left? Have you any idea?\"    \"Get a little chatter, now and then, of a gent that's rid into a town on  a black hoss, prettier'n anything that was ever seen before.    \"It's all pretty much the same, what news we get. Mostly I guess he jest  wanders around doin' no harm to nobody. But once in a while somebody  sicks a dog on Bart, and Bart jest nacherally chaws that dog in two.  Then the owner of the dog may start a fight, and Dan drops him and rides  on.\"    \"With a trail of dead men behind him?\" cried the doctor, hunching his  shoulders as if to shake off a chill.    \"Dead? Nope. You don't have to shoot to kill when you can handle a gun  the way Dan does. Nope, he jest wings 'em. Plants a chunk of lead in a  shoulder, or an arm, or a leg. That's all. They ain't no love of blood  in Dan--except-----\"    \"Well?\"    \"Doc,\" said Buck with a shudder, \"I ain't goin' to talk about the  exceptions. Mostly the news we gets of Dan is about troubles he's had.  But sometimes we hear of gents he's helped out when they was sick, and  things like that. They ain't nobody like Dan when a gent is down sick,  I'll tell a man!\"    The doctor sighed.    He said: \"And do I understand you to say that the girl and this  man--Whistling Dan, as you call him--are intimately and sentimentally  related?\"    \"She loves him,\" said Daniels slowly. \"She loves the ground he walks on  and the places where he's been.\"    \"But, sir, it would seem probable from your own reasoning that the  return of the man, in this case, will not be unwelcome to her.\"    \"Reason?\" broke out Daniels bitterly. \"What the hell has reason got to  do with Whistling Dan? Man, man! if Barry was to come back d'you suppose  he'd remember that he'd once told Kate he loved her? Doc, I know him as  near as any man can know him. I tell you, he thinks no more of her  than--than the wild geese think of her. If old Joe dies because Dan is  away--well, Cumberland is an old man anyway. But how could I stand to  see Barry pass Kate by with an empty eye, the way he'd do if he come  back? I'd want to kill him, and I'd get bumped off tryin' it, like as  not. And what would it do to Kate? It'd kill her, Doc, as sure as you're  born.\"    \"Your assumption being,\" murmured the doctor, \"that if she never sees  the man again she will eventually forget him.\"    \"D'you forget a knife that's sticking into you? No, she won't forget  him. But maybe after a while she'll be able to stand thinkin' about him.  She'll get used to the hurt. She'll be able to talk and laugh the way  she used to. Oh, doc, if you could of seen her as I've seen her in the  old days----\"    \"When the man was with her?\" cut in the doctor.    Buck Daniels caught his breath.    \"Damn your eternal soul, doc!\" he said softly.    And for a time neither of them spoke. Whatever went on in the mind of  Daniels, it was something that contorted his face. As for Byrne, he was  trying to match fact and possibility and he was finding a large gap  between the two; for he tried to visualise the man whose presence had  been food to old Joe Cumberland, and whose absence had taken the oil  from the lamp so that the flame now flickered dimly, nearly out. But he  could build no such picture. He could merely draw together a vague  abstraction of a man to whom the storm and the wild geese who ride the  storm had meaning and relationship. The logic which he loved was  breaking to pieces in the hands of Randall Byrne.    Silence, after all, is only a name, never a fact. There are noises in  the most absolute quiet. If there is not even the sound of the cricket  or the wind, if there are not even ghost whispers in the house, there is  the sigh of one's own breathing, and in those moments of deadly waiting  the beat of the heart may be as loud and as awful as the rattle of the  death-march. Now, between the doctor and the cowpuncher, such a silence  began. Buck Daniels wanted nothing more in the world than to be out of"]]]
