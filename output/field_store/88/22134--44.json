They are a  daring transcript of Louis XIV.'s \"L'etat, c'est moi.\" That was a bold  claim, even for an age attuned to the whims of autocrats: but this of  the young Corsican is even more daring, for he thereby equated himself  with a movement which claimed to be wide as humanity and infinite as  truth. And yet when he spoke these words, they were not scouted as  presumptuous folly: to most Frenchmen they seemed sober truth and  practical good sense. How came it, one asks in wonder, that after the  short space of fifteen years a world-wide movement depended on a  single life, that the infinitudes of 1789 lived on only in the form,  and by the pleasure, of the First Consul? Here surely is a political  incarnation unparalleled in the whole course of human history. The  riddle cannot be solved by history alone. It belongs in part to the  domain of psychology, when that science shall undertake the study, not  merely of man as a unit, but of the aspirations, moods, and whims of  communities and nations. Meanwhile it will be our far humbler task to  strive to point out the relation of Buonaparte to the Revolution, and  to show how the mighty force of his will dragged it to earth.    The first questions that confront us are obviously these. Were the  lofty aims and aspirations of the Revolution attainable? And, if so,  did the men of 1789 follow them by practical methods? To the former of  these questions the present chapter will, in part at least, serve as  an answer. On the latter part of the problem the events described in  later chapters will throw some light: in them we shall see that the  great popular upheaval let loose mighty forces that bore Buonaparte on  to fortune.    Here we may notice that the Revolution was not a simple and therefore  solid movement. It was complex and contained the seeds of discord  which lurk in many-sided and militant creeds. The theories of its  intellectual champions were as diverse as the motives which spurred on  their followers to the attack on the outworn abuses of the age.    Discontent and faith were the ultimate motive powers of the  Revolution. Faith prepared the Revolution and discontent accomplished  it. Idealists who, in varied planes of thought, preached the doctrine  of human perfectibility, succeeded in slowly permeating the dull  toiling masses of France with hope. Omitting here any notice of  philosophic speculation as such, we may briefly notice the teachings  of three writers whose influence on revolutionary politics was to be  definite and practical. These were Montesquieu, Voltaire, and  Rousseau. The first was by no means a revolutionist, for he decided in  favour of a mixed form of government, like that of England, which  guaranteed the State against the dangers of autocracy, oligarchy, and  mob-rule. Only by a ricochet did he assail the French monarchy. But he  re-awakened critical inquiry; and any inquiry was certain to sap the  base of the _ancien regime_ in France. Montesquieu's teaching inspired  the group of moderate reformers who in 1789 desired to re-fashion the  institutions of France on the model of those of England. But popular  sentiment speedily swept past these Anglophils towards the more  attractive aims set forth by Voltaire.    This keen thinker subjected the privileged classes, especially the  titled clergy, to a searching fire of philosophic bombs and barbed  witticisms. Never was there a more dazzling succession of literary  triumphs over a tottering system. The satirized classes winced and  laughed, and the intellect of France was conquered, for the  Revolution. Thenceforth it was impossible that peasants who were  nominally free should toil to satisfy the exacting needs of the  State, and to support the brilliant bevy of nobles who flitted gaily  round the monarch at Versailles. The young King Louis XVI., it is  true, carried through several reforms, but he had not enough strength  of will to abolish the absurd immunities from taxation which freed the  nobles and titled clergy from the burdens of the State. Thus, down to  1789, the middle classes and peasants bore nearly all the weight of  taxation, while the peasants were also encumbered by feudal dues and  tolls. These were the crying grievances which united in a solid  phalanx both thinkers and practical men, and thereby gave an immense  impetus to the levelling doctrines of Rousseau.    Two only of his political teachings concern us here, namely, social  equality and the unquestioned supremacy of the State; for to these  dogmas, when they seemed doomed to political bankruptcy, Napoleon  Buonaparte was to act as residuary legatee. According to Rousseau,  society and government originated in a social contract, whereby all  members of the community have equal rights. It matters not that the  spirit of the contract may have evaporated amidst the miasma of  luxury. That is a violation of civil society; and members are  justified in reverting at once to the primitive ideal. If the  existence of the body politic be endangered, force may be used:  \"Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be constrained to do  so by the whole body; which means nothing else than that he shall be  forced to be free.\" Equally plausible and dangerous was his teaching  as to the indivisibility of the general will. Deriving every public  power from his social contract, he finds it easy to prove that the  sovereign power, vested in all the citizens, must be incorruptible,  inalienable, unrepresentable, indivisible, and indestructible.  Englishmen may now find it difficult to understand the enthusiasm  called forth by this quintessence of negations; but to Frenchman  recently escaped from the age of privilege and warring against the  coalition of kings, the cry of the Republic one and indivisible was a  trumpet call to death or victory. Any shifts, even that of a  dictatorship, were to be borne, provided that social equality could be  saved. As republican Rome had saved her early liberties by intrusting  unlimited powers to a temporary dictator, so, claimed Rousseau, a  young commonwealth must by a similar device consult Nature's first law  of self-preservation. The dictator saves liberty by temporarily  abrogating it: by momentary gagging of the legislative power he  renders it truly vocal.    The events of the French Revolution form a tragic commentary on these  theories. In the first stage of that great movement we see the  followers of Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau marching in an  undivided host against the ramparts of privilege. The walls of the  Bastille fall down even at the blast of their trumpets. Odious feudal  privileges disappear in a single sitting of the National Assembly; and  the _Parlements_, or supreme law courts of the provinces, are swept  away. The old provinces themselves are abolished, and at the beginning  of 1790 France gains social and political unity by her new system of  Departments, which grants full freedom of action in local affairs,  though in all national concerns it binds France closely to the new  popular government at Paris. But discords soon begin to divide the  reformers: hatred of clerical privilege and the desire to fill the  empty coffers of the State dictate the first acts of spoliation.  Tithes are abolished: the lands of the Church are confiscated to the  service of the State; monastic orders are suppressed; and the  Government undertakes to pay the stipends of bishops and priests.  Furthermore, their subjection to the State is definitely secured by  the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (July, 1790) which invalidates  their allegiance to the Pope. Most of the clergy refuse: these are  termed non-jurors or orthodox priests, while their more complaisant  colleagues are known as constitutional priests. Hence arises a serious  schism in the Church, which distracts the religious life of the land,  and separates the friends of liberty from the champions of the  rigorous equality preached by Rousseau.    The new constitution of 1791 was also a source of discord. In its  jealousy of the royal authority, the National Assembly seized very  many of the executive functions of government. The results were  disastrous. Laws remained without force, taxes went uncollected, the  army was distracted by mutinies, and the monarchy sank slowly into the  gulf of bankruptcy and anarchy. Thus, in the course of three years,  the revolutionists goaded the clergy to desperation, they were about  to overthrow the monarchy, every month was proving their local  self-government to be unworkable, and they themselves split into  factions that plunged France into war and drenched her soil by  organized massacres.           *       *       *       *       *    We know very little about the impression made on the young Buonaparte  by the first events of the Revolution. His note-book seems even to  show that he regarded them as an inconvenient interference with his  plans for Corsica. But gradually the Revolution excites his interest.  In September, 1789, we find him on furlough in Corsica sharing the  hopes of the islanders that their representatives in the French  National Assembly will obtain the boon of independence. He exhorts  his compatriots to favour the democratic cause, which promises a  speedy deliverance from official abuses. He urges them to don the new  tricolour cockade, symbol of Parisian triumph over the old monarchy;  to form a club; above all, to organize a National Guard. The young  officer knew that military power was passing from the royal army, now  honeycombed with discontent, to the National Guard. Here surely was  Corsica's means of salvation. But the French governor of Corsica  intervenes. The club is closed, and the National Guard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#7)"],[1,"a lady bows to him, a  gentleman merely makes the gesture of rising by getting up half way from  his chair and at the same time bowing. Then he sits down again.    When a lady goes to a gentleman's office on business he should stand up to  receive her, offer her a chair, and not sit down until after she is  seated. When she rises to leave, he must get up instantly and stand until  she has left the office.    It is not necessary to add that every American citizen stands with his hat  off at the passing of the \"colors\" and when the national anthem is played.  If he didn't, some other more loyal citizen would take it off for him.  Also every man should stand with his hat off in the presence of a funeral  that passes close or blocks his way.      =A GENTLEMAN LIFTS HIS HAT=    Lifting the hat is a conventional gesture of politeness shown to strangers  only, not to be confused with bowing, which is a gesture used to  acquaintances and friends. In lifting his hat, a gentleman merely lifts it  slightly off his forehead and replaces it; he does not smile nor bow, nor  even look at the object of his courtesy. No gentleman ever subjects a lady  to his scrutiny or his apparent observation.    If a lady drops her glove, a gentleman should pick it up, hurry ahead of  her--on no account nudge her--offer the glove to her and say: \"I think you  dropped this!\" The lady replies: \"Thank you.\" The gentleman should then  lift his hat and turn away.    If he passes a lady in a narrow space, so that he blocks her way or in any  manner obtrudes upon her, he lifts his hat as he passes.    If he gets on a street car and the car gives a lurch just as he is about  to be seated and throws him against another passenger, he lifts his hat  and says \"Excuse me!\" or \"I beg your pardon!\" He must _not_ say \"Pardon  _me_!\" He must not take a seat if there are ladies standing. But if he is  sitting and ladies enter, should they be young, he may with perfect  propriety keep his seat. If a very old woman, or a young one carrying a  baby, enters the car, a gentleman rises at once, lifts his hat slightly,  and says: \"Please take my seat.\" He lifts his hat again when she thanks  him.    If the car is very crowded when he wishes to leave it and a lady is  directly in his way, he asks: \"May I get through, please?\" As she makes  room for him to pass, he lifts his hat and says: \"Thank you!\"    If he is in the company of a lady in a street car, he lifts his hat to  another gentleman who offers her a seat, picks up something she has  dropped, or shows her any civility.    He lifts his hat if he asks anyone a question, and always, if, when  walking on the street with either a lady or a gentleman, his companion  bows to another person. In other words, a gentleman lifts his hat whenever  he says \"Excuse me,\" \"Thank you,\" or speaks to a stranger, or is spoken to  by a lady, or by an older gentleman. And no gentleman ever keeps a pipe,  cigar or cigarette in his mouth when he lifts his hat, takes it off, or  bows.      =THE BOW OF CEREMONY=    The standing bow, made by a gentleman when he rises at a dinner to say a  few words, in response to applause, or across a drawing-room at a formal  dinner when he bows to a lady or an elderly gentleman, is usually the  outcome of the bow taught little boys at dancing school. The instinct of  clicking heels together and making a quick bend over from the hips and  neck, as though the human body had two hinges, a big one at the hip and a  slight one at the neck, and was quite rigid in between, remains in a  modified form through life. The man who as a child came habitually into  his mother's drawing-room when there was \"company,\" generally makes a  charming bow when grown, which is wholly lacking in self-consciousness.  There is no apparent \"heel-clicking\" but a camera would show that the  motion is there.    In every form of bow, as distinct from merely lifting his hat, a  gentleman looks at the person he is bowing to. In a very formal standing  bow, his heels come together, his knees are rigid and his expression is  rather serious.      =THE INFORMAL BOW=    The informal bow is merely a modification of the above; it is easy and  unstudied, but it should suggest the ease of controlled muscles, not the  floppiness of a rag doll.    In bowing on the street, a gentleman should never take his hat off with a  flourish, nor should he sweep it down to his knee; nor is it graceful to  bow by pulling the hat over the face as though examining the lining. The  correct bow, when wearing a high hat or derby, is to lift it by holding  the brim directly in front, take it off merely high enough to escape the  head easily, bring it a few inches forward, the back somewhat up, the  front down, and put it on again. To a very old lady or gentleman, to show  adequate respect, a sweeping bow is sometimes made by a somewhat  exaggerated circular motion downward to perhaps the level of the waist, so  that the hat's position is upside down.    If a man is wearing a soft hat he takes it by the crown instead of the  brim, lifts it slightly off his head and puts it on again.    The bow to a friend is made with a smile, to a very intimate friend often  with a broad grin that fits exactly with the word \"Hello\"; whereas the  formal bow is mentally accompanied by the formal salutation: \"How do you  do!\"      =THE BOW OF A WOMAN OF CHARM=    The reputation of Southern women for having the gift of fascination is  perhaps due not to prettiness of feature more than to the brilliancy or  sweetness of their ready smile. That Southern women are charming and  \"feminine\" and lovable is proverbial. How many have noticed that Southern  women always bow with the grace of a flower bending in the breeze and a  smile like sudden sunshine? The unlovely woman bows as though her head  were on a hinge and her smile sucked through a lemon.    Nothing is so easy for any woman to acquire as a charming bow. It is such  a short and fleeting duty. Not a bit of trouble really; just to incline  your head and spontaneously smile as though you thought \"Why, _there_ is  Mrs. Smith! How glad I am to see her!\"    Even to a stranger who does her a favor, a woman of charm always smiles as  she says \"Thank you!\" As a possession for either woman or man, a ready  smile is more valuable in life than a ready wit; the latter may sometimes  bring enemies, but the former always brings friends.      =WHEN TO BOW=    Under formal circumstances a lady is supposed to bow to a gentleman first;  but people who know each other well bow spontaneously without observing  this etiquette.    In meeting the same person many times within an hour or so, one does not  continue to bow after the second, or at most third meeting. After that one  either looks away or merely smiles. Unless one has a good memory for  people, it is always better to bow to some one whose face is familiar than  to run the greater risk of ignoring an acquaintance.      =THE \"CUT DIRECT\"=    For one person to look directly at another and not acknowledge the other's  bow is such a breach of civility that only an unforgivable misdemeanor can  warrant the rebuke. Nor without the gravest cause may a lady \"cut\" a  gentleman. But there are no circumstances under which a gentleman may  \"cut\" any woman who, even by courtesy, can be called a lady.    On the other hand, one must not confuse absent-mindedness, or a forgetful  memory with an intentional \"cut.\" Anyone who is preoccupied is apt to pass  others without being aware of them, and without the least want of  friendly regard. Others who have bad memories forget even those by whom  they were much attracted. This does not excuse the bad memory, but it  explains the seeming rudeness.    A \"cut\" is very different. It is a direct stare of blank refusal, and is  not only insulting to its victim but embarrassing to every witness.  Happily it is practically unknown in polite society.          CHAPTER V    ON THE STREET AND IN PUBLIC      =WALKING ON THE STREET=    A gentleman, whether walking with two ladies or one, takes the curb side  of the pavement. He should never sandwich himself between them.    A young man walking with a young woman should be careful that his manner  in no way draws attention to her or to himself. Too devoted a manner is  always conspicuous, and so is loud talking. Under no circumstances should  he take her arm, or grasp her by or above the elbow, and shove her here  and there, unless, of course, to save her from being run over! He should  not walk along hitting things with his stick. The small boy's delight in  drawing a stick along a picket fence should be curbed in the nursery! And  it is scarcely necessary to add that no gentleman walks along the street  chewing gum or, if he is walking with a lady, puffing a cigar or  cigarette.    All people in the streets, or anywhere in public, should be careful not to  talk too loud. They should especially avoid pronouncing people's names, or  making personal remarks that may attract passing attention or give a clue  to themselves.    One should never call out a name in public, unless it is absolutely  unavoidable. A young girl who was separated from her friends in a baseball  crowd had the presence of mind to put her hat on her parasol and lift it  above the people surrounding her so that her friends might find her.    Do not attract attention to yourself in public. This is one of the  fundamental rules of good breeding. Shun conspicuous manners, conspicuous  clothes, a loud voice, staring at people, knocking into them, talking  across anyone--in a word do not attract attention to yourself. Do not  expose your private affairs, feelings or innermost thoughts in public. You  are knocking down the walls of your house when you do.      =GENTLEMEN AND BUNDLES=    Nearly all books on etiquette insist that a \"gentleman must offer to carry  a lady's bundles.\" Bundles do not suggest a lady in the first place, and  as for gentlemen and"]]]
