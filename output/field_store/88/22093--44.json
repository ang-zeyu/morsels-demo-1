Homosexuality, mingled with various  other sexual abnormalities and excesses, seems to have flourished in Rome  during the empire, and is well exemplified in the persons of many of the  emperors.[43] Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero,  Galba, Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Commodus, and  Heliogabalus--many of them men of great ability and, from a Roman  standpoint, great moral worth--are all charged, on more or less solid  evidence, with homosexual practices. In Julius Caesar--\"the husband of all  women and the wife of all men\" as he was satirically termed--excess of  sexual activity seems to have accompanied, as is sometimes seen, an excess  of intellectual activity. He was first accused of homosexual practices  after a long stay in Bithynia with King Nikomedes, and the charge was  very often renewed. Caesar was proud of his physical beauty, and, like  some modern inverts, he was accustomed carefully to shave and epilate his  body to preserve the smoothness of the skin. Hadrian's love for his  beautiful slave Antinoues is well known; the love seems to have been deep  and mutual, and Antinoues has become immortalized, partly by the romance of  his obscure death and partly by the new and strangely beautiful type which  he has given to sculpture.[44] Heliogabalus, \"the most homosexual of all  the company,\" as he has been termed, seems to have been a true sexual  invert, of feminine type; he dressed as a woman and was devoted to the men  he loved.[45]    Homosexual practices everywhere flourish and abound in prisons. There is  abundant evidence on this point. I will only bring forward the evidence of  Dr. Wey, formerly physician to the Elmira Reformatory, New York.  \"Sexuality\" (he wrote in a private letter) \"is one of the most troublesome  elements with which we have to contend. I have no data as to the number of  prisoners here who are sexually perverse. In my pessimistic moments I  should feel like saying that all were; but probably 80 per cent, would be  a fair estimate.\" And, referring to the sexual influence which some men  have over others, he remarks that \"there are many men with features  suggestive of femininity that attract others to them in a way that reminds  me of a bitch in heat followed by a pack of dogs.\"[46] In Sing Sing prison  of New York, 20 per cent, of the prisoners are said to be actively  homosexual and a large number of the rest passively homosexual. These  prison relationships are not always of a brutal character, McMurtrie  states, the attraction sometimes being more spiritual than physical.[47]    Prison life develops and fosters the homosexual tendency of criminals; but  there can be little doubt that that tendency, or else a tendency to sexual  indifference or bisexuality, is a radical character of a very large number  of criminals. We may also find it to a considerable extent among tramps,  an allied class of undoubted degenerates, who, save for brief seasons, are  less familiar with prison life. I am able to bring forward interesting  evidence on this point by an acute observer who lived much among tramps in  various countries, and largely devoted himself to the study of them.[48]    The fact that homosexuality is especially common among men of exceptional  intellect was long since noted by Dante:--        \"In somma sappi, che tutti fur cherci      E litterati grandi, et di gran fama      D'un medismo peccato al mondo lerci.\"[49]    It has often been noted since and remains a remarkable fact.        There cannot be the slightest doubt that intellectual and      artistic abilities of the highest order have frequently been      associated with a congenitally inverted sexual temperament. There      has been a tendency among inverts themselves to discover their      own temperament in many distinguished persons on evidence of the      most slender character. But it remains a demonstrable fact that      numerous highly distinguished persons, of the past and the      present, in various countries, have been inverts. I may here      refer to my own observations on this point in the preface.      Mantegazza (_Gli Amori degli Uomini_) remarks that in his own      restricted circle he is acquainted with \"a French publicist, a      German poet, an Italian statesman, and a Spanish jurist, all men      of exquisite taste and highly cultivated mind,\" who are sexually      inverted. Krafft-Ebing, in the preface to his _Psychopathia      Sexualis_, referring to the \"numberless\" communications he has      received from these \"step-children of nature,\" remarks that \"the      majority of the writers are men of high intellectual and social      position, and often possess very keen emotions.\" Raffalovich      (_Uranisme_, p. 197) names among distinguished inverts, Alexander      the Great, Epaminondas, Virgil, the great Conde, Prince Eugene,      etc. (The question of Virgil's inversion is discussed in the      _Revista di Filologia_, 1890, fas. 7-9, but I have not been able      to see this review.) Moll, in his _Beruehmte Homosexuelle_ (1910,      in the series of _Grenzfragen des Nerven- und Seelenlebens_)      discusses the homosexuality of a number of eminent persons, for      the most part with his usual caution and sagacity; speaking of      the alleged homosexuality of Wagner he remarks, with entire      truth, that \"the method of arguing the existence of homosexuality      from the presence of feminine traits must be decisively      rejected.\" Hirschfeld has more recently included in his great      work _Die Homosexualitaet_ (1913, pp. 650-674) two lists, ancient      and modern, of alleged inverts among the distinguished persons of      history, briefly stating the nature of the evidence in each case.      They amount to nearly 300. Not all of them, however, can be      properly described as distinguished. Thus we end in the list 43      English names; of these at least half a dozen were noblemen who      were concerned in homosexual prosecutions, but were of no      intellectual distinction. Others, again, are of undoubted      eminence, but there is no good reason to regard them as      homosexual; this is the case, for instance, as regards Swift, who      may have been mentally abnormal, but appears to have been      heterosexual rather than homosexual; Fletcher, of whom we know      nothing definite in this respect, is also included, as well as      Tennyson, whose youthful sentimental friendship for Arthur Hallam      is exactly comparable to that of Montaigne for Etienne de la      Boetie, yet Montaigne is not included in the list. It may be      added, however, that while some of the English names in the list      are thus extremely doubtful, it would have been possible to add      some others who were without doubt inverts.    It has not, I think, been noted--largely because the evidence was  insufficiently clear--that among moral leaders, and persons with strong  ethical instincts, there is a tendency toward the more elevated forms of  homosexual feeling. This may be traced, not only in some of the great  moral teachers of old, but also in men and women of our own day. It is  fairly evident why this should be so. Just as the repressed love of a  woman or a man has, in normally constituted persons, frequently furnished  the motive power for an enlarged philanthropic activity, so the person  who sees his own sex also bathed in sexual glamour, brings to his work of  human service an ardor wholly unknown to the normally constituted  individual; morality to him has become one with love.[50] I am not  prepared here to insist on this point, but no one, I think, who studies  sympathetically the histories and experiences of great moral leaders can  fail in many cases to note the presence of this feeling, more or less  finely sublimated from any gross physical manifestation.    If it is probable that in moral movements persons of homosexual  temperament have sometimes become prominent, it is undoubtedly true,  beyond possibility of doubt, that they have been prominent in religion.  Many years ago (in 1885) the ethnologist, Elie Reclus, in his charming  book, _Les Primitifs_,[51] setting forth the phenomena of homosexuality  among the Eskimo Innuit tribe, clearly insisted that from time immemorial  there has been a connection between the invert and the priest, and showed  how well this connection is illustrated by the Eskimo _schupans_. Much  more recently, in his elaborate study of the priest, Horneffer discusses  the feminine traits of priests and shows that, among the most various  peoples, persons of sexually abnormal and especially homosexual  temperament have assumed the functions of priesthood. To the popular eye  the unnatural is the supernatural, and the abnormal has appeared to be  specially close to the secret Power of the World. Abnormal persons are  themselves of the same opinion and regard themselves as divine. As  Horneffer points out, they often really possess special aptitude.[52]  Karsch in his _Gleichgeschlechtliche Leben der Naturvoelker_ (1911) has  brought out the high religious as well as social significance of castes of  cross-dressed and often homosexual persons among primitive peoples. At the  same time Edward Carpenter in his remarkable book, _Intermediate Types  among Primitive Folk_ (1914), has shown with much insight how it comes  about that there is an organic connection between the homosexual  temperament and unusual psychic or divinatory powers. Homosexual men were  non-warlike and homosexual women non-domestic, so that their energies  sought different outlets from those of ordinary"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#7)"],[1," directly, that of contrectation  indirectly; but evidently he does not regard them as intimately related to  each other; he insists on the fact that they may exist apart from each  other, that they do not appear synchronously in youth: the contrectation  impulse he regards as secondary; it is, he states, an indirect result of  the sexual glands, \"only to be understood by the developmental history of  these glands and the object which they subserve\"; that is to say, that it  is connected with the rise of the sexual method of reproduction and the  desirability of the mingling of the two sexes in procreation, while the  impulse of detumescence arose before the sexual method of reproduction had  appeared; thus the contrectation impulse was propagated by natural  selection together with the sexual method of reproduction. The impulse of  contrectation is secondary, and Moll even regards it as a secondary sexual  character.    While, therefore, this analysis seems to include all the phenomena and to  be worthy of very careful study as a serious and elaborate attempt to  present an adequate psychological definition of the sexual impulse, it  scarcely seems to me that we can accept it in precisely the form in which  Moll presents it. I believe, however, that by analyzing the process a  little more minutely we shall find that these two constituents of the  sexual impulse are really much more intimately associated than at the  first glance appears, and that we need by no means go back to the time  when the sexual method of reproduction arose to explain the significance  of the phenomena which Moll includes under the term contrectation.    To discover the true significance of the phenomena in men it is necessary  to observe carefully the phenomena of love-making not only among men, but  among animals, in which the impulse of contrectation plays a very large  part, and involves an enormous expenditure of energy. Darwin was the first  to present a comprehensive view of, at all events a certain group of, the  phenomena of contrectation in animals; on his interpretation of those  phenomena he founded his famous theory of sexual selection. We are not  primarily concerned with that theory; but the facts on which Darwin based  his theory lie at the very roots of our subject, and we are bound to  consider their psychological significance. In the first place, since these  phenomena are specially associated with Darwin's name, it may not be out  of place to ask what Darwin himself considered to be their psychological  significance. It is a somewhat important question, even for those who are  mainly concerned with the validity of the theory which Darwin established  on those facts, but so far as I know it has not hitherto been asked. I  find that a careful perusal of the _Descent of Man_ reveals the presence  in Darwin's mind of two quite distinct theories, neither of them fully  developed, as to the psychological meaning of the facts he was collecting.  The two following groups of extracts will serve to show this very  conclusively: \"The lower animals have a sense of beauty,\" he declares,  \"powers of discrimination and taste on the part of the female\" (p.  211[21]); \"the females habitually or occasionally prefer the more  beautiful males,\" \"there is little improbability in the females of insects  appreciating beauty in form or color\" (p. 329); he speaks of birds as the  most \"esthetic\" of all animals excepting man, and adds that they have  \"nearly the same taste for the beautiful as we have\" (p. 359); he remarks  that a change of any kind in the structure or color of the male bird  \"appears to have been admired by the female\" (p. 385). He speaks of the  female Argus pheasant as possessing \"this almost human degree of taste.\"  Birds, again, \"seem to have some taste for the beautiful both in color and  sound,\" and \"we ought not to feel too sure that the female does not attend  to each detail of beauty\" (p. 421). Novelty, he says, is \"admired by birds  for its own sake\" (p. 495). \"Birds have fine powers of discrimination and  in some few instances it can be shown that they have a taste for the  beautiful\" (p. 496). The \"esthetic capacity\" of female animals has been  advanced by exercise just as our own taste has improved (p. 616). On the  other hand, we find running throughout the book quite another idea. Of  cicadas he tells us that it is probable that, \"like female birds, they are  excited or allured by the male with the most attractive voice\" (p. 282);  and, coming to _Locustidae_, he states that \"all observers agree that the  sounds serve either to call or excite the mute females\" (p. 283). Of birds  he says, \"I am led to believe that the females prefer or are most excited  by the more brilliant males\" (p. 316). Among birds also the males  \"endeavor to charm or excite their mates by love-notes,\" etc., and \"the  females are excited by certain males, and thus unconsciously prefer them\"  (p. 367), while ornaments of all kinds \"apparently serve to excite,  attract, or fascinate the female\" (p. 394). In a supplemental note, also,  written in 1876, five years after the first publication of the _Descent of  Man_, and therefore a late statement of his views, Darwin remarks that \"no  supporter of the principle of sexual selection believes that the females  select particular points of beauty in the males; they are merely excited  or attracted in a greater degree by one male than by another, and this  seems often to depend, especially with birds, on brilliant coloring\" (p.  623). Thus, on the one hand, Darwin interprets the phenomena as involving  a real esthetic element, a taste for the beautiful; on the other hand, he  states, without apparently any clear perception that the two views are  quite distinct, that the colors and sounds and other characteristics of  the male are not an appeal to any esthetic sense of the female, but an  appeal to her sexual emotions, a stimulus to sexual excitement, an  allurement to sexual contact. According to the first theory, the female  admires beauty, consciously or unconsciously, and selects the most  beautiful partner[22]; according to the second theory, there is no  esthetic question involved, but the female is unconsciously influenced by  the most powerful or complex organic stimulus to which she is subjected.  There can be no question that it is the second, and not the first, of  these two views which we are justified in accepting. Darwin, it must be  remembered, was not a psychologist, and he lived before the methods of  comparative psychology had begun to be developed; had he written twenty  years later we may be sure he would never have used so incautiously some  of the vague and hazardous expressions I have quoted. He certainly injured  his theory of sexual selection by stating it in too anthropomorphic  language, by insisting on \"choice,\" \"preference,\" \"esthetic sense,\" etc.  There is no need whatever to burden any statement of the actual facts by  such terms borrowed from human psychology. The female responds to the  stimulation of the male at the right moment just as the tree responds to  the stimulation of the warmest days in spring. We should but obscure this  fact by stating that the tree \"chooses\" the most beautiful days on which  to put forth its young sprouts. In explaining the correlation between  responsive females and accomplished males the supposition of esthetic  choice is equally unnecessary. It is, however, interesting to observe  that, though Darwin failed to see that the love-combats, pursuits, dances,  and parades of the males served as a method of stimulating the impulse of  contrectation--or, as it would be better to term it, tumescence--in the  male himself,[23] he to some extent realized the part thus played in  exciting the equally necessary activity of tumescence in the female.        The justification for using the term \"tumescence,\" which I here      propose, is to be found in the fact that vascular congestion,      more especially of the parts related to generation, is an      essential preliminary to acute sexual desire. This is clearly      brought out in Heape's careful study of the \"sexual season\" in      mammals. Heape distinguishes between the \"pro-estrum,\" or      preliminary period of congestion, in female animals and the      immediately following \"estrus,\" or period of desire. The latter      period is the result of the former, and, among the lower animals      at all events, intercourse only takes place during the estrus,      not during the pro-estrum. Tumescence must thus be obtained      before desire can become acute, and courtship runs _pari passu_      with physiological processes. \"Normal estrus,\" Heape states,      \"occurs in conjunction with certain changes in the uterine      tissue, and this is accompanied by congestion and stimulation or      irritation of the copulatory organs.... Congestion is invariably      present and is an essential condition.... The first sign of      pro-estrum noticed in the lower mammals is a swollen and      congested vulva and a general restlessness, excitement, or      uneasiness. There are other signs familiar to breeders of various      mammals, such as the congested conjunctiva of the rabbit's eye      and the drooping ears of the pig. Many monkeys exhibit congestion      of the face and nipples, as well as of the buttocks, thighs, and      neighboring parts; sometimes they are congested to a very marked      extent, and in some species a swelling, occasionally prodigious,      of the soft tissues round the anal and generative openings, which      is also at the time brilliantly congested, indicates the progress      of the pro-estrum.... The growth of the stroma-tissue [in the      uterus of monkeys during the pro-estrum] is rapidly followed by      an increase in the number and size of the vessels of the stroma;      the whole becomes richly supplied with blood, and the surface is      flushed and highly"]]]
