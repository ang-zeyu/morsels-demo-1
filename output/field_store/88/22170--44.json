As soon as the king caught sight of him, he said to the huntsmen,  \"Follow that stag about, but don't hurt him.\" So they hunted him all  day, but at the approach of sunset the king said to the hunter who had  followed the fawn the day before, \"Come and show me the little cottage.\"    So they went together, and when the king saw it he sent his companion  home, and went on alone so quickly that he arrived there before the  fawn; and, going up to the little door, knocked and said softly, \"Dear  little sister, let me in.\"    As the door opened, the king stepped in, and in great astonishment saw a  maiden more beautiful than he had ever seen in his life standing before  him. But how frightened she felt to see instead of her dear little fawn  a noble gentleman walk in with a gold crown on his head.    However, he appeared very friendly, and after a little talk he held out  his hand to her, and said, \"Wilt thou go with me to my castle and be my  dear wife?\"    \"Ah yes,\" replied the maiden, \"I would willingly; but I cannot leave my  dear fawn: he must go with me wherever I am.\"    \"He shall remain with you as long as you live,\" replied the king, \"and I  will never ask you to forsake him.\"    While they were talking, the fawn came bounding in, looking quite well  and happy. Then his sister fastened the string of rushes to his collar,  took it in her hand, and led him away from the cottage in the wood to  where the king's beautiful horse waited for him.    The king placed the maiden before him on his horse and rode away to his  castle, the fawn following by their side. Soon after, their marriage was  celebrated with great splendour, and the fawn was taken the greatest  care of, and played where he pleased, or roamed about the castle grounds  in happiness and safety.    In the meantime the wicked stepmother, who had caused these two young  people such misery, supposed that the sister had been devoured by wild  beasts, and that the fawn had been hunted to death. Therefore when she  heard of their happiness, such envy and malice arose in her heart that  she could find no rest till she had tried to destroy it.    She and her ugly daughter came to the castle when the queen had a little  baby, and one of them pretended to be a nurse, and at last got the  mother and child into their power.    They shut the queen up in the bath, and tried to suffocate her, and the  old woman put her own ugly daughter in the queen's bed that the king  might not know she was away.    She would not, however, let him speak to her, but pretended that she  must be kept quite quiet.    The queen escaped from the bath-room, where the wicked old woman had  locked her up, but she did not go far, as she wanted to watch over her  child and the little fawn.    For two nights the baby's nurse saw a figure of the queen come into the  room and take up her baby and nurse it. Then she told the king, and he  determined to watch himself. The old stepmother, who acted as nurse to  her ugly daughter, whom she tried to make the king believe was his wife,  had said that the queen was too weak to see him, and never left her  room. \"There cannot be two queens,\" said the king to himself, \"so  to-night I will watch in the nursery.\" As soon as the figure came in and  took up her baby, he saw it was his real wife, and caught her in his  arms, saying, \"You are my own beloved wife, as beautiful as ever.\"    The wicked witch had thrown her into a trance, hoping she would die, and  that the king would then marry her daughter; but on the king speaking to  her, the spell was broken. The queen told the king how cruelly she had  been treated by her stepmother, and on hearing this he became very  angry, and had the witch and her daughter brought to justice. They were  both sentenced to die--the daughter to be devoured by wild beasts, and  the mother to be burnt alive.    No sooner, however, was she reduced to ashes than the charm which held  the queen's brother in the form of a stag was broken; he recovered his  own natural shape, and appeared before them a tall, handsome young man.    After this, the brother and sister lived happily and peacefully for the  rest of their lives.          CHAPTER IV    HANSEL AND GRETHEL      Near the borders of a large forest dwelt in olden times a poor  wood-cutter, who had two children--a boy named Hansel, and his sister,  Grethel. They had very little to live upon, and once when there was a  dreadful season of scarcity in the land, the poor wood-cutter could not  earn sufficient to supply their daily food.    One evening, after the children were gone to bed, the parents sat  talking together over their sorrow, and the poor husband sighed, and  said to his wife, who was not the mother of his children, but their  stepmother, \"What will become of us, for I cannot earn enough to support  myself and you, much less the children? what shall we do with them, for  they must not starve?\"    \"I know what to do, husband,\" she replied; \"early to-morrow morning we  will take the children for a walk across the forest and leave them in  the thickest part; they will never find the way home again, you may  depend, and then we shall only have to work for ourselves.\"    \"No, wife,\" said the man, \"that I will never do. How could I have the  heart to leave my children all alone in the wood, where the wild beasts  would come quickly and devour them?\"    \"Oh, you fool,\" replied the stepmother, \"if you refuse to do this, you  know we must all four perish with hunger; you may as well go and cut the  wood for our coffins.\" And after this she let him have no peace till he  became quite worn out, and could not sleep for hours, but lay thinking  in sorrow about his children.    The two children, who also were too hungry to sleep, heard all that  their stepmother had said to their father. Poor little Grethel wept  bitter tears as she listened, and said to her brother, \"What is going to  happen to us, Hansel?\"    \"Hush, Grethel,\" he whispered, \"don't be so unhappy; I know what to do.\"    Then they lay quite still till their parents were asleep.    As soon as it was quiet, Hansel got up, put on his little coat,  unfastened the door, and slipped out The moon shone brightly, and the  white pebble stones which lay before the cottage door glistened like new  silver money. Hansel stooped and picked up as many of the pebbles as he  could stuff in his little coat pockets. He then went back to Grethel and  said, \"Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace; heaven will  take care of us.\" Then he laid himself down again in bed, and slept till  the day broke.    As soon as the sun was risen, the stepmother came and woke the two  children, and said, \"Get up, you lazy bones, and come into the wood with  me to gather wood for the fire.\" Then she gave each of them a piece of  bread, and said, \"You must keep that to eat for your dinner, and don't  quarrel over it, for you will get nothing more.\"    Grethel took the bread under her charge, for Hansel's pockets were full  of pebbles. Then the stepmother led them a long way into the forest.  They had gone but a very short distance when Hansel looked back at the  house, and this he did again and again.    At last his stepmother said, \"Why do you keep staying behind and looking  back so?\"    \"Oh, mother,\" said the boy, \"I can see my little white cat sitting on  the roof of the house, and I am sure she is crying for me.\"    \"Nonsense,\" she replied; \"that is not your cat; it is the morning sun  shining on the chimney-pot.\"    Hansel had seen no cat, but he stayed behind every time to drop a white  pebble from his pocket on the ground as they walked.    As soon as they reached a thick part of the wood, their stepmother said:    \"Come, children, gather some wood, and I will make a fire, for it is  very cold here.\"    Then Hansel and Grethel raised quite a high heap of brushwood and  faggots, which soon blazed up into a bright fire, and the woman said to  them:    \"Sit down here, children, and rest, while I go and find your father, who  is cutting wood in the forest; when we have finished our work, we will  come again and fetch you.\"    Hansel and Grethel seated themselves by the fire, and when noon arrived  they each ate the piece of bread which their stepmother had given them  for their dinner; and as long as they heard the strokes of the axe they  felt safe, for they believed that their father was working near them.  But it was not an axe they heard--only a branch which still hung on a  withered tree, and was moved up and down by the wind. At last, when they  had been sitting there a long time, the children's eyes became heavy  with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When they awoke it was dark  night, and poor Grethel began to cry, and said, \"Oh, how shall we get  out of the wood?\"    But Hansel comforted her. \"Don't fear,\" he said; \"let us wait a little  while till the moon rises, and then we shall easily find our way home.\"    Very soon the full moon rose, and then Hansel took his little sister by  the hand, and the white pebble stones, which glittered like newly-coined  money in the moonlight, and which Hansel had dropped as he walked,  pointed out the way. They walked all the night through, and did not  reach their father's house till break of day.    They knocked at the door, and when their stepmother opened it, she  exclaimed: \"You"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"ng; he is wonderfully made besides. His fins  radiate brilliant light, the very sun is obscured by it,[123] and  also his eyes shed such splendor that frequently the sea is  illuminated suddenly by it.[121] No wonder that this marvellous  beast is the plaything of God, in whom He takes His pastime.[124]    There is but one thing that makes leviathan repulsive, his foul  smell: which is so strong that if it penetrated thither, it would  render Paradise itself an impossible abode.[125]    The real purpose of leviathan is to be served up as a dainty to  the pious in the world to come. The female was put into brine as  soon as she was killed, to be preserved against the time when her  flesh will be needed.[126] The male is destined to offer a  delectable sight to all beholders before he is consumed. When his  last hour arrives, God will summon the angels to enter into  combat with the monster. But no sooner will leviathan cast his  glance at them than they will flee in fear and dismay from the  field of battle. They will return to the charge with swords, but  in vain, for his scales can turn back steel like straw. They will  be equally unsuccessful when they attempt to kill him by throwing  darts and slinging stones; such missiles will rebound without  leaving the least impression on his body. Disheartened, the  angels will give up the combat, and God will command leviathan  and behemot to enter into a duel with each other. The issue will  be that both will drop dead, behemot slaughtered by a blow of  leviathan's fins, and leviathan killed by a lash of behemot's  tail. From the skin of leviathan God will construct tents to  shelter companies of the pious while they enjoy the dishes made  of his flesh. The amount assigned to each of the pious will be in  proportion to his deserts, and none will envy or begrudge the  other his better share. What is left of leviathan's skin will be  stretched out over Jerusalem as a canopy, and the light streaming  from it will illumine the whole world, and what is left of his  flesh after the pious have appeased their appetite, will be  distributed among the rest of men, to carry on traffic  therewith.[127]    On the same day with the fishes, the birds were created, for  these two kinds of animals are closely related to each other.  Fish are fashioned out of water, and birds out of marshy ground  saturated with water.[128]    As leviathan is the king of fishes, so the ziz is appointed to  rule over the birds.[129] His name comes from the variety of  tastes his flesh has; it tastes like this, zeh, and like that,  zeh.[130] The ziz is as monstrous of size as leviathan himself.  His ankles rest on the earth, and his head reaches to the very  sky.[121]    It once happened that travellers on a vessel noticed a bird. As  he stood in the water, it merely covered his feet, and his head  knocked against the sky. The onlookers thought the water could  not have any depth at that point, and they prepared to take a  bath there. A heavenly voice warned them: \"Alight not here! Once  a carpenter's axe slipped from his hand at this spot, and it took  it seven years to touch bottom.\" The bird the travellers saw was  none other than the ziz.[132] His wings are so huge that unfurled  they darken the sun.[133] They protect the earth against the  storms of the south; without their aid the earth would not be  able to resist the winds blowing thence.[134] Once an egg of the  ziz fell to the ground and broke. The fluid from it flooded sixty  cities, and the shock crushed three hundred cedars. Fortunately  such accidents do not occur frequently. As a rule the bird lets  her eggs slide gently into her nest. This one mishap was due to  the fact that the egg was rotten, and the bird cast it away  carelessly. The ziz has another name, Renanin,[135] because he is  the celestial singer.[136] On account of his relation to the  heavenly regions he is also called Sekwi, the seer, and, besides,  he is called \"son of the nest,\"[137] because his fledgling birds  break away from the shell without being hatched by the mother  bird; they spring directly from the nest, as it were.[138] Like  leviathan, so ziz is a delicacy to be served to the pious at the  end of time, to compensate them for the privations which  abstaining from the unclean fowls imposed upon them.[139]      THE SIXTH DAY    As the fish were formed out of water, and the birds out of boggy  earth well mixed with water, so the mammals were formed out of  solid earth,[140] and as leviathan is the most notable  representative of the fish kind, and ziz of the bird kind, so  behemot is the most notable representative of the mammal kind.  Behemot matches leviathan in strength, and he had to be  prevented, like leviathan, from multiplying and increasing, else  the world could not have continued to exist; after God had  created him male and female, He at once deprived him of the  desire to propagate his kind.[141] He is so monstrous that he  requires the produce of a thousand mountains for his daily food.  All the water that flows through the bed of the Jordan in a year  suffices him exactly for one gulp. It therefore was necessary to  give him one stream entirely for his own use, a stream flowing  forth from Paradise, called Yubal.[142] Behemot, too, is destined  to be served to the pious as an appetizing dainty, but before  they enjoy his flesh, they will be permitted to view the mortal  combat between leviathan and behemot, as a reward for having  denied themselves the pleasures of the circus and its  gladiatorial contests.[143]    Leviathan, ziz, and behemot are not the only monsters; there are  many others, and marvellous ones, like the reem, a giant animal,  of which only one couple, male and female, is in existence. Had  there been more, the world could hardly have maintained itself  against them. The act of copulation occurs but once in seventy  years between them, for God has so ordered it that the male and  female reem are at opposite ends of the earth, the one in the  east, the other in the west. The act of copulation results in the  death of the male. He is bitten by the female and dies of the  bite. The female becomes pregnant and remains in this state for  no less than twelve years. At the end of this long period she  gives birth to twins, a male and a female. The year preceding her  delivery she is not able to move. She would die of hunger, were  it not that her own spittle flowing copiously from her mouth  waters and fructifies the earth near her, and causes it to bring  forth enough for her maintenance. For a whole year the animal can  but roll from side to side, until finally her belly bursts, and  the twins issue forth. Their appearance is thus the signal for  the death of the mother reem. She makes room for the new  generation, which in turn is destined to suffer the same fate as  the generation that went before. Immediately after birth, the one  goes eastward and the other westward, to meet only after the  lapse of seventy years, propagate themselves, and perish.[144] A  traveller who once saw a reem one day old described its height to  be four parasangs, and the length of its head one parasang and a  half.[145] Its horns measure one hundred ells, and their height  is a great deal more.[146]    One of the most remarkable creatures is the \"man of the  mountain,\" Adne Sadeh, or, briefly, Adam.[147] His form is  exactly that of a human being, but he is fastened to the ground  by means of a navel-string, upon which his life depends. The cord  once snapped, he dies. This animal keeps himself alive with what  is produced by the soil around about him as far as his tether  permits him to crawl. No creature may venture to approach within  the radius of his cord, for he seizes and demolishes whatever  comes in his reach. To kill him, one may not go near to him, the  navel-string must be severed from a distance by means of a dart,  and then he dies amid groans and moans.[143] Once upon a time a  traveller happened in the region where this animal is found. He  overheard his host consult his wife as to what to do to honor  their guest, and resolve to serve \"our man,\" as he said. Thinking  he had fallen among cannibals, the stranger ran as fast as his  feet could carry him from his entertainer, who sought vainly to  restrain him. Afterward, he found out that there had been no  intention of regaling him with human flesh, but only with the  flesh of the strange animal called \"man.\"[146] As the \"man of the  mountain\" is fixed to the ground by his navel-string, so the  barnacle-goose is grown to a tree by its bill. It is hard to say  whether it is an animal and must be slaughtered to be fit for  food, or whether it is a plant and no ritual ceremony is  necessary before eating it.[150]    Among the birds the phoenix is the most wonderful. When Eve gave  all the animals some of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the  phoenix was the only bird that refused to eat thereof, and he was  rewarded with eternal life. When he has lived a thousand years,  his body shrinks, and the feathers drop from it, until he is as  small as an egg. This is the nucleus of the new bird.[151]    The phoenix is also called \"the guardian of the terrestrial  sphere.\" He runs with the sun on his circuit, and he spreads out  his wings and catches up the fiery rays of the sun.[152] If he  were not there to intercept them, neither man nor any other  animate being would keep alive. On his right wing the following  words are inscribed in huge letters,[153] about four thousand  stadia high: \"Neither the earth produces me, nor the heavens, but  only the wings of fire.\" His food consists of the manna of heaven  and the dew of the earth. His excrement is a worm, whose  excrement in turn is the cinnamon used by kings and princes.[152]  Enoch, who saw the phoenix birds when he was translated,  describes them as flying creatures, wonderful and strange in  appearance, with the feet and tails of lions,"]]]
