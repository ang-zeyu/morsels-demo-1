[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12296"],[0,"Camps and Trails in China (#7)"],[1,"  female serow for us which are especially interesting as they represent a  different subspecies (_Capricornis sumatrensis argyrochcaetes_) from those  we killed in Yün-nan.    Chi-yuen-kang did yield us results, however, for we discovered a wonderful  bat cave less than a mile from our temple. Its entrance was a low round  hole half covered with vegetation, and opening into a high circular  gallery; from this three long corridors branched off like fingers from the  palm of a giant's hand. The cave was literally alive with bats. There must  have been ten thousand and on the first day we killed a hundred,  representing seven species and at least four genera. This was especially  remarkable as it is unusual to find more than two or three species living  together.    The cave was a regular bat apartment house for each corridor was divided by  rock partitions into several small rooms in every one of which bats of  different species were rearing their families. The young in most instances  were only a few days old but were thickly clustered on the walls and  ceilings, and each and every one was squeaking at the top of its tiny  lungs. The place must have been occupied for scores, if not hundreds, of  years for the floor was knee-deep with dung.    When we returned the day after our first visit we found that many of the  young bats had been removed by their parents and in some instances entire  rooms had been vacated. After the first day the odor of the cave was so  nauseating that to enable us to go inside it was necessary to wear gauze  pads of iodoform over our noses.    The bats at this place were killed with bamboo switches but later we always  used a long gill net which had been especially made in New York. We could  hang the net over the entrance to a cave and, when all was ready, send a  native into the galleries to stir up the animals. As they flew out they  became entangled in the net and could be caught or killed before they were  able to get away. It was sometimes possible to catch every specimen in a  cavern, and moreover, to secure them in perfect condition without broken  skulls or wings.    If a bat escaped from the net it would never again strike it, for the  animals are wonderfully accurate in flight and most expert dodgers. Even  while in a cave, where hundreds of bats were in the air, they seldom flew  against us, although we might often be brushed by their wings; and it was a  most difficult thing to hit them with a bamboo switch. Their ability in  dodging is without doubt a necessary development of their feeding habits  for, with the exception of a few species, bats live exclusively upon  insects and catch them in the air.    It is a rather terrifying experience for a girl to sit in a bat cave  especially if the light has gone out and she is in utter darkness. Of  course she has a cap tightly pulled over her ears, for what girl, even if  she be a naturalist's wife, would venture into a den of evil bats with one  wisp of hair exposed!    All about is the swish of ghostly wings which brush her face or neck and  the air is full of chattering noises like the grinding of hundreds of tiny  teeth. Sometimes a soft little body plumps into her lap and if she dares to  take her hands from her face long enough to disengage the clinging animal  she is liable to receive a vicious bite from teeth as sharp as needles.  But, withal, it is good fun, and think how quickly formalin jars or  collecting trays can be filled with beautiful specimens!          CHAPTER V      THE YEN-PING REBELLION    On Sunday, June 18, we went to the bat cave to obtain a new supply of  specimens. Upon our return, just as we were about to sit down to luncheon,  four excited Chinese appeared with the following letter from Mr. Caldwell:        DEAR ROY:        There was quite a lively time in the city at an early hour this      morning. The rebels have taken Yen-ping and it looks as though there      was trouble ahead. Northern soldiers have been sent for and the chances      are that either tonight or tomorrow morning there will be quite a      battle. Bankhardt, Dr. Trimble and myself have just made a round of the      city, visiting the telegraph office, post office and other places, and      while we do not believe that the foreigners will be molested,      nevertheless it is impossible to tell just what to expect. It is      certain, however, that the Consul will order all of us to Foochow if      news of the situation reaches there. Owing to the uncertainty, I think      you had better come in to Yen-ping so as to be ready for any      eventuality.        After talking the situation over with Dr. Trimble and Mr. Bankhardt, we      all agreed that the wisest thing is for you to come in immediately. I      am sending four burden-bearers for it will be out of the question to      find any tomorrow, if trouble occurs tonight. The city gates are closed      so you will have to climb up the ladder over the wall behind our      compound. Best wishes.        HARRY.        P.S.--Later: It is again reported that Northern soldiers are to arrive      tonight. If they do and trouble occurs your only chance is to get to      Yen-ping today.        H.C.    The camp immediately was thrown into confusion for Da-Ming, the cook, and  the burden-bearers were jabbering excitedly at the top of their voices.  The servants began to pack the loads at once and meanwhile we ate a roast  chicken faster than good table manners would permit--in fact, we took it in  our fingers. We were both delighted at the prospect of some excitement and  talked almost as fast as the Chinese.    In just one hour from the time Harry's letter had been received, we were  on the way to Yen-ping. It was the hottest part of the day, and we were  dripping with perspiration when we left the cool darkness of the ravine and  struck across the open valley, which lay shimmering in a furnace-like heat.  At the first rest house on the top of the long hill we waited nearly an  hour for our bearers who were struggling under the heavy loads.    Three miles farther on a poor woman tottered past us on her peglike feet  leaning on the arm of a man. A short distance more and we came to the  second rest house. We had been there but a few moments when three panting  women, steadying themselves with long staves and barely able to walk on  feet not more than four inches long, came up the hill. With them were  several men bearing household goods in large bundles and huge red boxes.    The exhausted women sank upon the benches and fanned themselves while the  perspiration ran down their flushed faces. They looked so utterly miserable  that we told the cook to give them a piece of cake which Mrs. Caldwell had  sent us the day before. Their gratitude was pitiful, but, of course, they  gave the larger share to the men.    It was not long before other women and children appeared on the hill path,  all struggling upward under heavy loads, or tottering along on tightly  bound feet. Probably these women had not walked so far in their entire  lives, but the fear of the Northern soldiers and what would happen in the  city if they took possession had driven them from their homes.    Farther on we had a clear view across the valley where a long line of  people was filing up to a temple which nestled into the hillside. Half a  mile beyond were two other temples both crowded with refugees and their  goods. Hundreds of families were seeking shelter in every little house  beside the road and were overflowing into the cowsheds and pigpens.    At six o'clock we stood on the summit of the hill overlooking the city and  half an hour later were clambering up the ladder over the high wall of the  compound, just behind Dr. Trimble's house. We were wet through and while  cooling off heard the story of the morning's fighting. It seemed that a  certain element in the city was in coöperation with the representatives of  the revolutionary organization. These men wished to obtain possession of  Yen-ping and, after the rebellion was well started, to gather forces, march  to Foochow, and force the Governor to declare the independence of the  province.    The plot had been hatching for several days, but the death of Yuan Shi-kai  had somewhat delayed its fruition. Saturday, however, it was known  throughout the city that trouble would soon begin. Sunday morning at half  past three, a band of one hundred men from Yuchi had marched to Yen-ping  where they were received by a delegation of rebels dressed in white who  opened to them the east gate of the city. Immediately they began to fire  up the streets to intimidate the people and in a short time were in a hot  engagement with the seventeen Northern soldiers, some of whom threw away  their guns and swam across the river. The remaining city troops were from  the province of Hunan and their sympathies were really with the South in  the great rebellion. These immediately joined the rebels, where they were  received with open arms. It was reported that the _tao-tai_ (district  mandarin) had asked for troops from Foochow and that these might be  expected at any moment; thus when they arrived a real battle could be  expected and it was very likely that the city would be partly destroyed.    We had a picnic supper on the Caldwell's porch and discussed the situation.  It was the opinion of all that the foreigners were in no immediate danger,  but nevertheless it was considered wise to be prepared, and we decided upon  posts for each man if it should become necessary to protect the compound.    Hundreds of people were besieging the missionaries with requests to be  allowed to bring their goods and families inside the walls, but these  necessarily had to be refused. Had the missionaries allowed the Chinese to  bring their valuables inside it would have cost them the right of Consular  protection and, moreover, their compound would have been the first to be  attacked if looting began.

FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Alfred Farrell, Field Worker  Monticello, Florida  January 12, 1937    MATILDA BROOKS      A GOVERNOR'S SLAVES    Matilda Brooks, 79, who lives in Monticello, Fla., was once a slave of a  South Carolina governor.    Mrs. Brooks was born in 1857 or 1858 in Edgefield, S.C. Her parents were  Hawkins and Harriet Knox, and at the time of the birth of their daughter  were slaves on a large plantation belonging to Governor Frank Pickens.  On this plantation were raised cotton, corn, potatoes, tobacco, peas,  wheat and truck products. As soon as Matilda was large enough to go into  the fields she helped her parents with the farming.    The former slave describes Governor Pickens as being 'very good' to his  slaves. He supervised them personally, although official duties often  made this difficult. He saw to it that their quarters were comfortable  and that they always had sufficient food. When they became ill he would  himself doctor on them with pills, castor oil, turpentine other  remedies. Their diet consisted largely of potatoes, corn bread, syrup,  greens, peas, and occasionally ham, fowl and other meats or poultry.  Their chief beverage was coffee made from parched corn.    Since there were no stoves during slavery, they cooked their foods in  large iron pots suspended from racks built into the fireplaces. Fried  foods were prepared in iron 'spiders', large frying pans with legs.  These pans were placed over hot coals, and the seasoning was done with  salt which they secured from evaporated sea-water. After the food was  fried and while the coals were still glowing the fat of oxen and sheep  was melted to make candles. Any grease left over was put into a large  box, to be used later for soap-making.    Lye for the soap was obtained by putting oak ashes in a barrel and  pouring water over them. After standing for several days--until the  ashes had decayed--holes were drilled into the bottom of the barrell  and the liquid drained off. This liquid was the lye, and it was then  trickled into the pot into which the fat had been placed. The two were  then boiled, and after cooling cut into squares of soap.    Water for cooking and other purposes was obtained from a well, which  also served as a refrigerator at times. Matilda does not recall seeing  ice until many years later.    In the evenings Matilda's mother would weave cloth on her spinning-jenny  and an improvised loom. This cloth was sometimes dyed in various colors:  blue from the indigo plant; yellow from the crocus and brown from the  bark of the red oak. Other colors were obtained from berries and other  plants.    In seasons other than picking-time for the cotton the children were  usually allowed to play in the evenings, when cotton crops were large,  however, they spent their evenings picking out seeds from the cotton  bolls, in order that their parents might work uninterruptedly in the  fields during the day. The cotton, after being picked and separated,  would be weighed in balances and packed tightly in 'crocus' bags.    Chicken and goose feathers were jealously saved during these days. They  were used for the mattresses that rested on the beds of wooden slats  that were built in corners against the walls. Hoop skirts were worn at  the time, but for how long afterward Matilda does not remember. She only  recalls that they were disappearing 'about the time I saw a windmill for  the first time'.    The coming of the Yankee soldiers created much excitement among the  slaves on the Pickens plantation. The slaves were in ignorance of  activities going on, and of their approach, but when the first one was  sighted the news spread 'just like dry grass burning up a hill'. Despite  the kindness of Governor Pickens the slaves were happy to claim their  new-found freedom. Some of them even ran away to join the Northern  armies before they were officially freed. Some attempted to show their  loyalty to their old owners by joining the southern armies, but in this  section they were not permitted to do so.    After she was released from slavery Matilda came with her parents to the  Monticello section, where the Knoxes became paid house servants. The  parents took an active part in politics in the section, and Matilda was  sent to school. White teachers operated the schools at first, and were  later replaced by Negro teachers. Churches were opened with Negro  ministers in the pulpits, and other necessities of community life  eventually came to the vicinity.    Matilda still lives in one of the earlier homes of her parents in the  area, now described as 'Rooster-Town' by its residents. The section is  in the eastern part of Monticello.

FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT  American Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)    Alfred Farrell, Field Worker  John A. Simms, Editor  Titusville, Florida  September 25, 1936    TITUS I. BYNES      Titus B. [TR: Titus I. above] Bynes, affectionately known as \"Daddy  Bynes\", is reminiscent of Harriet Beecher Stowe's immortal \"Uncle Tom\"  and Joel Chandler Harris' inimitable 'Uncle Remus' with his white beard  and hair surrounding a smiling black face. He was born in November 1846  in what is now Clarendon County, South Carolina. Both his father, Cuffy,  and mother, Diana, belonged to Gabriel Flowden who owned 75 or 80 slaves  and was noted for his kindness to them.    Bynes' father was a common laborer, and his mother acted in the capacity  of chambermaid and spinner. They had 12 children, seven boys--Abraham,  Tutus[TR:?], Reese, Lawrence, Thomas, Billie, and Hamlet--and five  girls--Charity, Chrissy, Fannie, Charlotte, and Violet.    When Titus was five or six years of age he was given to Flowden's wife  who groomed him for the job of houseboy. Although he never received any  education, Bynes was quick to learn. He could tell the time of day and  could distinguish one newspaper from another. He recalled an incident  which happened when he was about eight years of age which led him to  conceal his precociousness. One day while writing on the ground, he  heard his mistress' little daughter tell her mother that he was writing  about water. Mistress Flowden called him and told him that if he were  caught writing again his right arm would be cut off. From then on his  precociousness vanished. In regards to religion, Bynes can recall the  Sunday services very vividly; and he tells how the Negroes who were  seated in the gallery first heard a sermon by the white minister and  then after these services they would gather on the main floor and hear a  sermon by a Negro preacher.    Bynes served in the Civil War with his boss, and he can remember the  regiment camp between Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina.  His mistress would not permit Bynes to accompany his master to Virginia  to join the Hampton Legion on the grounds that it was too cold for him.  And thus ended his war days! When he was 20 years of age, his father  turned him loose. Young Bynes rented 14 acres of land from Arthur Harven  and began farming.    In 1868 he left South Carolina and came to Florida. He settled in  Enterprise (now Benson Springs), Velusia County where he worked for J.C.  Hayes, a farmer, for one year, after which he homesteaded. He next  became a carpenter and, as he says himself, \"a jack of all trades and  master of none.\" He married shortly after coming to Florida and is the  father of three sons--\"as my wife told me,\" he adds with a twinkle in  his eyes. His wife is now dead. He was prevailed upon while very ill to  enter the Titusville Poor Farm where he has been for almost two years.
