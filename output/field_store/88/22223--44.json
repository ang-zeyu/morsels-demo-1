[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#7)"],[1,"a, and thus it is also writ in Quiros' Memorial, as printed by  Dalrymple, vol. ii. p. 146.]    Proceeding next to the other side of the harbour, we there landed, near a  few houses, at the invitation of some people who came down to the shore;  but we had not been there five minutes before they wanted us to be gone. We  complied, and proceeded up the harbour in order to sound it, and look for  fresh water, of which, as yet, we had seen none, but the very little that  the natives brought, which we knew not where they got. Nor was our search  now attended with success; but this is no proof that there is not any. The  day was too far spent to examine the place well enough to determine this  point. Night having brought us on board, I was informed that no soul had  been off to the ship; so soon was the curiosity of these people satisfied.  As we were coming on board, we heard the sound of a drum, and, I think, of  some other instruments, and saw people dancing; but us soon as they heard  the noise of the oars, or saw us, all was silent.    Being unwilling to lose the benefit of the moon-light nights, which now  happened, at seven a.m. on the 23d, we weighed; and, with a light air of  wind, and the assistance of our boats, proceeded out of the harbour, the  south end of which, at noon, bore W.S.W., distant about two miles.    When the natives saw us under sail, they came off in canoes, making  exchanges with more confidence than before, and giving such extraordinary  proofs of their honesty as surprised us. As the ship, at first, had fresh  way through the water, several of them dropped astern after they had  received our goods, and before they had time to deliver theirs in return.  Instead of taking advantage of this, as our friends at the Society Isles  would have done, they used their utmost efforts to get up with us, and to  deliver what they had already been paid for. One man, in particular,  followed us a considerable time, and did not reach us till it was calm, and  the thing was forgotten. As soon as he came alongside he held up the thing  which several were ready to buy; but he refused to part with it, till he  saw the person to whom he had before sold it, and to him he gave it. The  person, not knowing him again, offered him something in return, which he  refused, and shewed him what he had given him before. Pieces of cloth, and  marble paper, were in most esteem with them; but edge-tools, nails, and  beads, they seemed to disregard. The greatest number of canoes we had  alongside at once did not exceed eight, and not more than four or five  people in each, who would frequently retire to the shore all on a sudden,  before they had disposed of half their things, and then others would come  off.    At the time we came out of the harbour, it was about low water, and great  numbers of people were then on the shoals or reefs which lie along the  shore, looking, as we supposed., for shell and other fish. Thus our being  on their coast, and in one of their ports, did not hinder them from  following the necessary employments. By this time they might be satisfied  we meant them no harm; so that, had we made a longer stay, we might soon  have been upon good terms with this ape-like nation. For, in general, they  are the most ugly, ill-proportioned people I ever saw, and in every respect  different from any we had met with in this sea. They are a very  dark-coloured and rather diminutive race; with long heads, flat faces, and  monkey countenances. Their hair mostly black or brown, is short and curly;  but not quite so soft and woolly as that of a negroe. Their beards are very  strong, crisp, and bushy, and generally black and short. But what most adds  to their deformity, is a belt or cord which they wear round the waist, and  tie so tight over the belly, that the shape of their bodies is not unlike  that of an overgrown pismire. The men go quite naked, except a piece of  cloth or leaf used as a wrapper*.    [* The particular manner of applying the wrapper may be seen in Wafer's  voyage, who mentions this singular custom as existing, though with some  little variation, amongst the Indians of the Isthmus of Darien.  See Wafer's Voyage, p. 140.]    We saw but few women, and they were not less ugly than the men; their  heads, faces, and shoulders, are painted red; they wear a kind of  petticoat; and some of them had something over their shoulders like a bag,  in which they carry their children. None of them came off to the ship, and  they generally kept at a distance when we were on shore. Their ornaments  are ear-rings, made of tortoise-shell and bracelets. A curious one of the  latter, four or five inches broad, wrought with thread or cord, and studded  with shells, is worn by them just above the elbow. Round the right wrist  they wear hogs' tusks, bent circular, and rings made of shells; and round  their left, a round piece of wood, which we judged was to ward off the  bow-string. The bridge of the nose is pierced, in which they wear a piece of  white stone, about an inch and a half long. As signs of friendship they  present a green branch, and sprinkle water with the hand over the head.    Their weapons are clubs, spears, and bows and arrows. The two former are  made of hard or iron-wood. Their bows are about four feet long, made of a  stick split down the middle, and are not circular. The arrows, which are a  sort of reeds, are sometimes armed with a long and sharp point, made of the  hard wood, and sometimes with a very hard point made of bone; and these  points are all covered with a substance which we took for poison. Indeed  the people themselves confirmed our suspicions, by making signs to us not  to touch the point, and giving us to understand that if we were prickled by  them we should die. They are very careful of them themselves, and keep  them, always wrapped up in a quiver. Some of these arrows are formed with  two or three points, each with small prickles on the edges, to prevent the  arrow being drawn out of the wound.    The people of Mallicollo seemed to be a quite different nation from any we  had yet met with, and speak a different language. Of about eighty words,  which Mr Forster collected, hardly one bears any affinity to the language  spoken at any other island or place I had ever been at. The letter R is  used in many of their words; and frequently two or three being joined  together, such words we found difficult to pronounce. I observed that they  could pronounce most of our words with great ease. They express their  admiration by hissing like a goose.    To judge of the country by the little water we saw of it, it must be  fertile; but I believe their fruits are not so good as those of the Society  or Friendly Isles. Their cocoa-nut trees, I am certain, are not; and their  bread-fruit and plantains did not seem much better. But their yams appeared  to be very good. We saw no other animals than those I have already  mentioned. They have not so much as a name for a dog, and consequently have  none, for which reason we left them a dog and a bitch; and there is no  doubt they will be taken care of, as they were very fond of them.    After we had got to sea, we tried what effect one of the poisoned arrows  would have on a dog. Indeed we had tried it in the harbour the very first  night, but we thought the operation was too slight, as it had no effect.  The surgeon now made a deep incision in the dog's thigh, into which he laid  a large portion of the poison, just as it was scraped from the arrows, and  then bound up the wound with a bandage. For several days after we thought  the dog was not so well as it had been before, but whether this was really  so, or only suggested by imagination, I know not. He was afterwards as if  nothing had been done to him, and lived to be brought home to England.  However, I have no doubt of this stuff being of a poisonous quality, as it  could answer no other purpose. The people seemed not unacquainted with the  nature of poison, for when they brought us water on shore, they first  tasted it, and then gave us to understand we might with safety drink it.    This harbour, which is situated on the N.E. side of Mallicollo, not far  from the S.E. end, in latitude 16 deg. 25' 20\" S., longitude 167 deg. 57' 23\" E., I  named Port Sandwich. It lies in S.W. by S. about one league, and is one-third  of a league broad. A reef of rocks extends out a little way from each  point, but the channel is of a good breadth, and hath in it from forty to  twenty-four fathoms water. In the port, the depth of water is from twenty  to four fathoms; and it is so sheltered that no winds can disturb a ship at  anchor there. Another great advantage is, you can lie so near the shore, as  to cover your people, who may be at work upon it.    CHAPTER IV.    _An Account of the Discovery of several Islands, and an Interview and  Skirmish with the Inhabitants upon one of them. The Arrival of the Ship at  Tanna, and the Reception we met with there._    1774 July    Soon after we got to sea, we had a breeze at E.S.E. with which we stood  over for Ambrym till three o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind veering  to the E.N.E. we tacked and stretched to the S.E. and weathered the S.E.  end of Mallicolo, off which we discovered three or four small islands, that  before appeared to be connected. At sun-set the point bore S. 77 deg. W.,  distant three leagues, from which the coast seemed to trend away west. At  this time, the isle of Ambrym extended from N. 3 deg. E. to N. 65 deg. E. The isle  of Paoon from N. 76 deg. E. to S. 88 deg. E.; and the isle of Apee from S. 83 deg. E.  to S. 43 deg. E. We stood for this last isle, which we reached by midnight, and  then brought-to till day-break on the 24th, when we made sail to the S.E.,  with a view of plying up to the eastward on the south side of Apee. At  sun-rise we discovered several more islands, extending from the S.E. point of  Apee to the south as far "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15888"],[0,"The Unwritten Literature of the Hopi (#7)"],[1,"19: Hewett, E.L., Op. cit., p. 117.]    \"The religious life of the Pueblo Indian is expressed mainly through the  community dances, and in these ceremonies are the very foundations of  the ancient wisdom....\"    Dance is perhaps hardly the right word for these ceremonies, yet it is  what the Hopi himself calls them, and he is right. But we who have used  the word to designate the social dances of modern society or the  aesthetic and interpretive dances for entertainment and aesthetic  enjoyment will have to tune our sense to a different key to be in  harmony with the Hopi dance.    Our primitive's communion with nature and with his own spirit have  brought him to a reverent attitude concerning the wisdom of birds,  beasts, trees, clouds, sunlight, and starlight, and most of all he  clings trustingly to the wisdom of his fathers.    \"All this,\" according to Hewett, \"is voiced in his prayers and  dramatized in his dances--rhythm of movement and of color summoned to  express in utmost brilliancy the vibrant faith of a people in the deific  order of the world and in the way the ancients devised for keeping man  in harmony with his universe. All his arts, therefore, are rooted in  ancestral beliefs and in archaic esthetic forms.\"    Surely no people on earth, not even the Chinese, show a more consistent  reverence for the wisdom of the past as preserved in their myths and  legends, than do the Hopi.          IX. HOPI MYTHS AND TRADITIONS AND SOME CEREMONIES BASED UPON THEM           *       *       *       *       *    =The Emergence Myth and the Wu-wu-che-ma Ceremony=    Each of the Hopi clans preserves a separate origin or emergence myth,  agreeing in all essential parts, but carrying in its details special  reference to its own clan. All of them claim, however, a common origin  in the interior of the earth, and although the place of emergence to the  surface is set in widely separated localities, they agree in maintaining  this to be the fourth plane on which mankind has existed.    The following is an abbreviation of the version gathered by A.M.  Stephen, who lived many years among the Hopi and collected these sacred  tales from the priests and old men of all the different villages some  fifty years ago, as reported by Mindeleff.[20]    [Footnote 20: Mindeleff, Cosmos, Traditional History of Tusayan (After  A.M. Stephen): Bureau American Ethnology, vol. 8, pp. 16-41, 1887.]    In the beginning all men lived together in the lowest depths, in a  region of darkness and moisture; their bodies were mis-shapen and  horrible and they suffered great misery.    By appealing to Myuingwa (a vague conception of the god of the interior)  and Baholinkonga (plumed serpent of enormous size, genius of water)  their old men obtained a seed from which sprang a magic growth of cane.    The cane grew to miraculous height and penetrated through a crevice in  the roof overhead and mankind climbed to a higher plane. Here was dim  light and some vegetation. Another magic cane brought them to a higher  plane, with more light and vegetation, and here was the creation of the  animal kingdom. Singing was always the chief magic for creating  anything. In like manner, they rose to the fourth stage or earth; some  say by a pine tree, others say through the hollow cylinder of a great  reed or rush.    This emergence was accompanied by singing, some say by the Magic Twins,  the two little war gods, others say by the mocking bird. At any rate, it  is important to observe that when the song ran out, no more people could  get through and many had to remain behind.    However, the outlet through which man came has never been closed, and  Myuingwa sends through it the germs of all living things. It is still  symbolized, Stephen says, by the peculiar construction of the hatchway  of the kiva, in designs on the kiva sand altars, and by the unconnected  circle on pottery, basketry, and textiles. Doubtless the most direct  representation of this opening to the underworld is the sipapu or  ceremonial small round opening in the floor of the kiva, which all Hopi,  without exception, agree symbolizes the opening or spirit passage to the  underworld. \"Out of the sipapu we all came,\" they say, \"and back to the  underworld, through the sipapu, we shall go when we die.\"    Once every year the Hopi hold an eight-day ceremony commemorating this  emergence from the underworld. It is called the Wu-wu-che-ma, occurs in  November and thus begins the series of Winter festivals. Four societies  take part, and the Da-dow-Kiam or Mocking Bird Society opens the  ceremony by singing into the kiva of the One-Horned Society this  emergence song, the very song sung by the mocking bird at the original  emergence, according to Voth.[21] This ceremony is a prayer to the  powers of the underworld for prosperity and for germination of new life,  human, animal, and vegetable. Fewkes called this the New Fire Ceremony,  and in the course of the eight-day ceremonial the kindling of new fire  with the primitive firestick does take place. But it is not hard to feel  a close relation between the idea of fire and that of germination which  stands out as the chief idea in the whole ritual, particularly in the  subtle dramatization of the underworld life and emergence as carried on  in the kivas, preceding the public \"dance\" on the last day.    [Footnote 21: Voth, H.R., Op. cit, p. 11.]    Thus we have at least three distinct points in this one myth that  account for three definite things we find the Hopi doing today: (1)  Note that it was \"our old men\" who got from the gods the magic seed of  the tall cane which brought relief to the people. To this day it is the  old men who are looked up to and depended upon to direct the people in  all important matters. \"It was always that way.\" (2) While the magic  song lasted the people came through the sipapu, but when the song ended  no more could come through, and there was weeping and wailing. Singing  is today the absolutely indispensable element in all magic rites. There  may be variation in the details of some performances, but \"unless you  have the right song, it won't work.\" The Hopi solemnly affirm they have  preserved their original emergence song, and you hear it today on the  first morning of the Wu-wu-che-ma. (3) The sipapu seen today in the  floor of the kiva or ceremonial chamber symbolizes the passage from  which all mankind emerged from the underworld, so all the Hopi agree.    The belief of the present-day Hopi that the dead return through the  sipapu to the underworld is based firmly upon an extension of this myth,  as told to Voth,[22] for it furnishes a clear account of how the Hopi  first became aware of this immortality.    [Footnote 22: Voth, H.R., Op. cit, p. 11.]    It seems that soon after they emerged from the underworld the son of  their chief died, and the distressed father, believing that an evil one  had come out of the sipapu with them and caused this death, tossed up a  ball of meal and declared that the unlucky person upon whose head it  descended should be thus discovered to be the guilty party and thrown  back down into the underworld. The person thus discovered begged the  father not to do this but to take a look down through the sipapu into  the old realm and see there his son, quite alive and well. This he did,  and so it was.    Do the Hopi believe this now? Yes, so they tell you. And Mr. Emery  Koptu, sculptor, who lived among them only a few years ago and enjoyed a  rare measure of their affection and good will, recently told the writer  of a case in point:    On July 4, 1928, occurred the death of Supela, last of the Sun priests.  Mr. Koptu, who had done some studies of this fine Hopi head, was in  Supela's home town, Walpi, at the time of the old priest's passing.    The people were suffering from a prolonged drouth, and since old Supela  was soon to go through the sipapu to the underworld, where live the  spirits who control rain and germination, he promised that he would  without delay explain the situation to the gods and intercede for his  people and that they might expect results immediately after his arrival  there. Since his life had been duly religious and acceptable to the  gods, it was the belief of both Supela and his friends that he would  make the journey in four days, which is record time for the trip, when  one has no obstacles in the way of atonements or punishments to work off  en-route. Supela promised this, and the people looked for its  fulfillment. Four days after Supela's death the long drouth was broken  by a terrific rain storm accompanied by heavy thunder and lightning. Did  the Hopi show astonishment? On the contrary they were aglow with  satisfaction and exchanged felicitations on the dramatic assurance of  Supela's having \"gotten through\" in four days. The most wonderful eulogy  possible!    It is indicated, in the story of Supela, that the Hopi believe that only  the \"pure in heart,\" so to speak, go straight to the abode of the  spirits, whereas some may have to take much longer because of atonements  or punishments for misdeeds. Their basis for this lies in a tradition  regarding the visit of a Hopi youth to the underworld and his return to  the earth with an account of having passed on the way many suffering  individuals engaged in painful pursuits and unable to go on until the  gods decreed they had suffered enough. He had also seen a great smoke  arising from a pit where the hopelessly wicked were totally burned up.  He was told to go back to his people and explain all these things and  tell them to make many pahos (prayer-sticks) and live straight and the  good spirits could be depended upon to help them with rain and  germination. Voth records[23] two variants of this legend.
