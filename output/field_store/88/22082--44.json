This agreed with the position of  Ptolemy Claudius of Alexandria, who showed the curvature of the  earth from north to south by observing that the Polar Star was  higher in the north and lower in the south. That it was curved  from east to west followed from the observation that two clocks  placed one west and one east would record a different time for the  same eclipse of the moon.    Alfred wrote poems on the worthiness of wisdom and knowledge in  preference to material pleasures, pride, and fame, in dealing with  life's sorrow and strife. His observations on human nature and his  proverbs include:    1.  As one sows, so will he mow.  2.  Every man's doom [judgment] returns to his door.  3.  He who will not learn while young, will repent of it when old.  4.  Weal [prosperity] without wisdom is worthless.  5.  Though a man had 70 acres sown with red gold, and the gold grew      like grass, yet he is not a whit the worthier unless he gain      friends for himself.  6.  Gold is but a stone unless a wise man has it.  7.  It's hard to row against the sea flood; so it is against      misfortune.  8.  He who toils in his youth to win wealth, so that he may enjoy      ease in his old age, has well bestowed his toil.  9.  Many a man loses his soul through silver.  10. Wealth may pass away, but wisdom will remain, and no man may      perish who has it for his comrade.  11. Don't choose a wife for her beauty nor for wealth, but study      her disposition.  12. Many an apple is bright without and bitter within.  13. Don't believe the man of many words.  14. With a few words a wise man can compass much.  15. Make friends at market, and at church, with poor and with      rich.  16. Though one man wielded all the world, and all the joy that      dwells therein, he could not therewith keep his life.  17. Don't chide with a fool.  18. A fool's bolt is soon shot.  19. If you have a child, teach it men's manners while it is      little. If you let him have his own will, he will cause you much      sorrow when he comes of age.  20. He who spares the rod and lets a young child rule, shall rue      it when the child grows old.  21. Either drinking or not drinking is, with wisdom, good.  22. Be not so mad as to tell your friend all your thoughts.  23. Relatives often quarrel together.  24. The barkless dog bites ill.  25. Be wise of word and wary of speech, then all shall love you.  26. We may outride, but not outwit, the old man.  27. If you and your friend fall out, then your enemy will know      what your friend knew before.  28. Don't choose a deceitful man as a friend, for he will do you      harm.  29. The false one will betray you when you least expect it.  30. Don't choose a scornful false friend, for he will steal your      goods and deny the theft.  31. Take to yourself a steadfast man who is wise in word and deed;      he will prove a true friend in need.    To restore education and religion, Alfred disseminated the Anglo-  Saxon Chronicles; the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History of  the English Nation; the \"Consolidation of Philosophy\" by Roman  philosopher Boethius, which related the use of adversity to  develop the soul, and described the goodness of God and how the  highest happiness comes from spiritual values and the soul, which  are eternal, rather than from material or earthly pursuits, which  are temporal; and Pope Gregory's Pastoral Care, which he had  translated into English and was the fundamental book on the duty  of a bishop, which included a duty to teach laymen; and Orosius'  History of the World, which he had translated into English.  Alfred's advice to pastors was to live as they had been taught  from books and to teach this manner of life to others. To be  avoided was pride, the mind's deception of seeking glory in the  name of doing good works, and the corruption of high office. Bede  was England's first scholar, first theologian, and first  historian. He wrote poetry, theological books, homilies, and  textbooks on grammar, rhetoric [public speaking and debating],  arithmetic, and astronomy. He adhered to the doctrine that death  entered the world by the sin of Adam, the first man. He began the  practice of dating years from the birth of Christ and believed  that the earth was round. Over the earth was a fiery spherical  firmament. Above this were the waters of the heavens. Above this  were the upper heavens, which contained the angels and was  tempered with ice. He declared that comets portend downfalls of  kingdoms, pestilence, war, winds, or heat. This reflected the  church's view that a comet was a ball of fire flung from the right  hand of an angry God as a warning to mankind, usually for  disbelief. Storms were begun by the devil.    A famous poem, the oral legend of Beowulf, a hero who led his men  into adventures and performed great feats and fought monsters and  dragons, was put into writing with a Christian theme. In it,  loyalty to one's lord is a paramount virtue. Also available in  writing was the story of King Arthur's twelve victorious battles  against the pagan Saxons, authored by Nennius.    There were professional story tellers attached to great men.  Others wandered from court to court, receiving gifts for their  story telling. Men usually told oral legends of their own feats  and those of their ancestors after supper.    Alfred had monasteries rebuilt with learned and moral men heading  them. He built a nunnery which was headed by his daughter as  prioress. He built a strong wall with four gates around London,  which he had taken into his control. He appointed his son-in-law,  who was one of his eorldormen, to be alderman [older man] to  govern London and to be the shire's earl. A later king built a  palace in London, although Winchester was still the royal capital  town. When the king traveled, he and his retinue were fed by the  local people at their expense.    After Alfred's death, his daughter Aethelflared ruled the country  for seven years. She had more fortified burhs built and led  soldiers to victories.    Under the royalty were the nobles. An earl headed each shire as  representative of the King. The term \"earl\" came to denote an  office instead of a nobleman. He led the array of his shire to do  battle if the shire was attacked. He executed all royal commands.  An earl received grants of land and could claim hospitality and  maintenance for himself, his officers, and his servants. He  presided over the shire court. He received one-third of the fines  from the profits of justice and collected as well a third of the  revenues derived from tolls and duties levied in the boroughs of  his shire. The office tended to be hereditary. Royal  representatives called \"reeves\" started to assist them. The reeve  took security from every person for the maintenance of the public  peace. He also tracked cattle thieves, brought suspects to court,  gave judgments according to the doom books, and delivered  offenders to punishment.    Under the earls were the thegns. By service to the King, it was  possible for a coerl to rise to become a thegn and to be given  land by the King. Other thegns performed functions of magistrates.  A thegn was later identified as a person with five hides of land,  a kitchen, a church, a bell house, a judicial place at the  burhgemote [a right of magistracy], and an appointment in the  King's hall. He was bound to service in war by virtue of his  landholding instead of by his relationship to the king. Nobility  was now a territorial attribute, rather than one of birth. The  wergeld of a thegn was 1200s. when that of a ceorl or ordinary  freeman was 200s. The wergeld of an earl or bishop was four times  that of a thegn: 5800s. The wergeld of a king or archbishop was  six times that of a thegn: 7200s. The higher a man's wergeld, the  higher was his legal status in the scale of punishment, giving  credible evidence, and participation in legal proceedings. The  sokemen were freemen who had inherited their own land, chose their  own lord, and attended and were subject to their lord's court.  That is, their lord has soke [soc] jurisdiction over them. A ceorl  typically had a single hide of land. A smallholder rented land of  about 30 acres from a landlord, which he paid by doing work on the  lord's demesne [household or messuage] land, paying money rent, or  paying a food rent such as in eggs or chickens. Smallholders made  up about two fifths of the population. A cottager had one to five  acres of land and depended on others for his living. Among these  were shepherds, ploughmen, swineherds, and blacksmiths. They also  participated in the agricultural work, especially at harvest time.    It was possible for a thegn to become an earl, probably by the  possession of forty hides. He might even acquire enough land to  qualify him for the witan. Women could be present at the  witanagemot and shiregemote [meeting of the people of the shire].  They could sue and be sued in the courts. They could independently  inherit, possess, and dispose of property. A wife's inheritance  was her own and under no control of her husband.    Marriage required the consent of the lady and her friends. The man  also had to arrange for the foster lean, that is, remuneration for  rearing and support of expected children. He also declared the  amount of money or land he would give the lady for her consent,  that is, the morgengift, and what he would bequeath her in case of  his death. It was given to her on the morning after the wedding  night. The family of the bride was paid a \"mund\" for transferring  the rightful protection they possessed over her to the family of  the husband. If the husband died and his kindred did not accept  the terms sanctioned by law, her kindred could repurchase the  rightful protection. If she remarried within a year of his death,  she had to forfeit the morgengift and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#7)"],[1,"shoulders, thus raising the  collarbone and allowing the air to pass freely into the small upper  lobe of the right lung, which place is sometimes the breeding place of  tuberculosis.    At the beginning of practice, you may have more or less trouble in  acquiring the Complete Breath, but a little practice will make  perfect, and when you have once acquired it you will never willingly  return to the old methods.          CHAPTER IX.      PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF THE COMPLETE BREATH.    Scarcely too much can be said of the advantages attending the practice  of the Complete Breath. And yet the student who has carefully read the  foregoing pages should scarcely need to have pointed out to him such  advantages.    The practice of the Complete Breath will make any man or woman immune  to Consumption and other pulmonary troubles, and will do away with all  liability to contract \"colds,\" as well as bronchial and similar  weaknesses. Consumption is due principally to lowered vitality  attributable to an insufficient amount of air being inhaled. The  impairment of vitality renders the system open to attacks from disease  germs. Imperfect breathing allows a considerable part of the lungs to  remain inactive, and such portions offer an inviting field for  bacilli, which invading the weakened tissue soon produce havoc. Good  healthy lung tissue will resist the germs, and the only way to have  good healthy lung tissue is to use the lungs properly.    Consumptives are nearly all narrow-chested. What does this mean?  Simply that these people were addicted to improper habits of  breathing, and consequently their chests failed to develop and expand.  The man who practices the Complete Breath will have a full broad  chest, end the narrow-chested man may develop his chest to normal  proportions if he will but adopt this mode of breathing. Such people  must develop their chest cavities if they value their lives. Colds may  often be prevented by practicing a little vigorous Complete Breathing  whenever you feel that you are being unduly exposed. When chilled,  breathe vigorously a few minutes, and you will feel a glow all over  your body. Most colds can be cured by Complete Breathing and partial  fasting for a day.    The quality of the blood depends largely upon its proper oxygenation  in the lungs, and if it is under-oxygenated it becomes poor in quality  and laden with all sorts of impurities, and the system suffers from  lack of nourishment, and often becomes actually poisoned by the waste  products remaining uneliminated in the blood. As the entire body,  every organ and every part, is dependent upon the blood for  nourishment, impure blood must have a serious effect upon the entire  system. The remedy is plain--practice the Yogi Complete Breath.    The stomach and other organs of nutrition suffer much from improper  breathing. Not only are they ill nourished by reason of the lack of  oxygen, but as the food must absorb oxygen from the blood and become  oxygenated before it can be digested and assimilated, it is readily  seen how digestion and assimilation is impaired by incorrect  breathing. And when assimilation is not normal, the system receives  less and less nourishment, the appetite fails, bodily vigor decreases,  and energy diminishes, and the man withers and declines. All from the  lack of proper breathing.    Even the nervous system suffers from improper breathing, inasmuch as  the brain, the spinal cord, the nerve centers, and the nerves  themselves, when improperly nourished by means of the blood, become  poor and inefficient instruments for generating, storing and  transmitting the nerve currents. And improperly nourished they will  become if sufficient oxygen is not absorbed through the lungs. There  is another aspect of the case whereby the nerve currents themselves,  or rather the force from which the nerve currents spring, becomes  lessened from want of proper breathing, but this belongs to another  phase of the subject which is treated of in other chapters of this  book, and our purpose here is to direct your attention to the fact  that the mechanism of the nervous system is rendered inefficient as an  instrument for conveying nerve force, as the indirect result of a lack  of proper breathing.    The effect of the reproductive organs upon the general health is too  well known to be discussed at length here, but we may be permitted to  say that with the reproductive organs in a weakened condition the  entire system feels the reflex action and suffers sympathetically. The  Complete Breath produces a rhythm which is Nature's own plan for  keeping this important part of the system in normal condition, and,  from the first, it will be noticed that the reproductive functions are  strengthened and vitalized, thus, by sympathetic reflex action, giving  tone to the whole system. By this, we do not mean that the lower sex  impulses will be aroused; far from it. The Yogis are advocates of  continence and chastity, and have learned to control the animal  passions. But sexual control does not mean sexual weakness, and the  Yogi teachings are that the man or woman whose reproductive organism  is normal and healthy, will have a stronger will with which to control  himself or herself. The Yogi believes that much of the perversion of  this wonderful part of the system comes from a lack of normal health,  and results from a morbid rather than a normal condition of these  organs. A little careful consideration of this question will prove  that the Yogi teachings are right. This is not the place to discuss  the subject fully, but the Yogis know that sex-energy may be conserved  and used for the development of the body and mind of the individual,  instead of being dissipated in unnatural excesses as is the wont of so  many uninformed people. By special request we will give in this book  one of the favorite Yogi exercises for this purpose. But whether or  not the student wishes to adopt the Yogi theories of continence and  clean-living, he or she will find that the Complete Breath will do  more to restore health to this part of the system than anything else  ever tried. Remember, now, we mean normal health, not undue  development. The sensualist will find that normal means a lessening of  desire rather than an increase; the weakened man or woman will find a  toning up and a relief from the weakness which has heretofore  depressed him or her. We do not wish to be misunderstood or misquoted  on this subject. The Yogis' ideal is a body strong in all its parts,  under the control of a masterful and developed Will, animated by high  ideals.    In the practice of the Complete Breath, during inhalation, the  diaphragm contracts and exerts a gentle pressure upon the liver,  stomach and other organs, which in connection with the rhythm of the  lungs acts as a gentle massage of these organs and stimulates their  actions, and encourages normal functioning. Each inhalation aids in  this internal exercise, and assists in causing a normal circulation to  the organs of nutrition and elimination. In High or Mid Breathing the  organs lose the benefit accruing from this internal massage.    The Western world is paying much attention to Physical Culture just  now, which is a good thing. But in their enthusiasm they must not  forget that the exercise of the external muscles is not everything.  The internal organs also need exercise, and Nature's plan for this  exercise is proper breathing. The diaphragm is Nature's principal  instrument for this internal exercise. Its motion vibrates the  important organs of nutrition and elimination, and massages and kneads  them at each inhalation and exhalation, forcing blood into them, and  then squeezing it out, and imparting a general tone to the organs. Any  organ or part of the body which is not exercised gradually atrophies  and refuses to function properly, and lack of the internal exercise  afforded by the diaphragmatic action leads to diseased organs. The  Complete Breath gives the proper motion to the diaphragm, as well as  exercising the middle and upper chest. It is indeed \"complete\" in its  action.    From the standpoint of Western physiology alone, without reference to  the Oriental philosophies and science, this Yogi system of Complete  Breathing is of vital importance to every man, woman and child who  wishes to acquire health and keep it. Its very simplicity keeps  thousands from seriously considering it, while they spend fortunes in  seeking health through complicated and expensive \"systems.\" Health  knocks at their door and they answer not. Verily the stone which the  builders reject is the real cornerstone of the Temple of Health.          CHAPTER X.      A FEW BITS OF YOGI LORE.    We give below three forms of breath, quite popular among the Yogis.  The first is the well-known Yogi Cleansing Breath, to which is  attributed much of the great lung endurance found among the Yogis.  They usually finish up a breathing exercise with this Cleansing  Breath, and we have followed this plan in this book. We also give the  Yogi Nerve Vitalizing Exercise, which has been handed down among them  for ages, and which has never been improved on by Western teachers of  Physical Culture, although some of them have \"borrowed\" it from  teachers of Yoga. We also give the Yogi Vocal Breath, which accounts  largely for the melodious, vibrant voices of the better class of the  Oriental Yogis. We feel that if this book contained nothing more than  these three exercises, it would be invaluable to the Western student.  Take these exercises as a gift from your Eastern brothers and put them  into practice.    THE YOGI CLEANSING BREATH.    The Yogis have a favorite form of breathing which they practice when  they feel the necessity of ventilating and cleansing the lungs. They  conclude many of their other breathing exercises with this breath, and  we have followed this practice in this book. This Cleansing Breath"]]]
