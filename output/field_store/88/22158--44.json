[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#7)"],[1," As the destruction of many of our castles is due to the action of  Cromwell and the Parliament, who caused them to be \"slighted\" partly  out of revenge upon the loyal owners who had defended them, so several  of our town-walls were thrown down by order of Charles II at the  Restoration on account of the active assistance which the townspeople  had given to the rebels. The heads of rebels were often placed on  gateways. London Bridge, Lincoln, Newcastle, York, Berwick,  Canterbury, Temple Bar, and other gates have often been adorned with  these gruesome relics of barbarous punishments.    How were these strong walls ever taken in the days before gunpowder  was extensively used or cannon discharged their devastating shells?  Imagine you are present at a siege. You would see the attacking force  advancing a huge wooden tower, covered with hides and placed on  wheels, towards the walls. Inside this tower were ladders, and when  the \"sow\" had been pushed towards the wall the soldiers rushed up  these ladders and were able to fight on a level with the garrison.  Perhaps they were repulsed, and then a shed-like structure would be  advanced towards the wall, so as to enable the men to get close enough  to dig a hole beneath the walls in order to bring them down. The  besieged would not be inactive, but would cast heavy stones on the  roof of the shed. Molten lead and burning flax were favourite means of  defence to alarm and frighten away the enemy, who retaliated by  casting heavy stones by means of a catapult into the town.      [4] _The Builder_, April 16, 1904.    [Illustration: Bootham Bar, York]    Amongst the fragments of walls still standing, those at Newcastle are  very massive, sooty, and impressive. Southampton has some grand walls  left and a gateway, which show how strongly the town was fortified.  The old Cinque Port, Sandwich, formerly a great and important town,  lately decayed, but somewhat renovated by golf, has two gates left,  and Rochester and Canterbury have some fragments of their walls  standing. The repair of the walls of towns was sometimes undertaken by  guilds. Generous benefactors, like Sir Richard Whittington, frequently  contributed to the cost, and sometimes a tax called murage was levied  for the purpose which was collected by officers named muragers.    The city of York has lost many of its treasures, and the City Fathers  seem to find it difficult to keep their hands off such relics of  antiquity as are left to them. There are few cities in England more  deeply marked with the impress of the storied past than York--the long  and moving story of its gates and walls, of the historical  associations of the city through century after century of English  history. About eighty years ago the Corporation destroyed the  picturesque old barbicans of the Bootham, Micklegate, and Monk Bars,  and only one, Walmgate, was suffered to retain this interesting  feature. It is a wonder they spared those curious stone half-length  figures of men, sculptured in a menacing attitude in the act of  hurling large stones downwards, which vaunt themselves on the summit  of Monk Bar--probably intended to deceive invaders--or that  interesting stone platform only twenty-two inches wide, which was the  only foothold available for the martial burghers who guarded the city  wall at Tower Place. A year or two ago the City Fathers decided, in  order to provide work for the unemployed, to interfere with the city  moats by laying them out as flower-beds and by planting shrubs and  making playgrounds of the banks. The protest of the Yorks  Archaeological Society, we believe, stayed their hands.    The same story can be told of far too many towns and cities. A few  years ago several old houses were demolished in the High Street of the  city of Rochester to make room for electric tramways. Among these was  the old White Hart Inn, built in 1396, the sign being a badge of  Richard II, where Samuel Pepys stayed. He found that \"the beds were  corded, and we had no sheets to our beds, only linen to our mouths\" (a  narrow strip of linen to prevent the contact of the blanket with the  face). With regard to the disappearance of old inns, we must wait  until we arrive at another chapter.    We will now visit some old towns where we hope to discover some  buildings that are ancient and where all is not distressingly new,  hideous, and commonplace. First we will travel to the old-world town  of Lynn--\"Lynn Regis, vulgarly called King's Lynn,\" as the royal  charter of Henry VIII terms it. On the land side the town was defended  by a fosse, and there are still considerable remains of the old wall,  including the fine Gothic South Gates. In the days of its ancient  glory it was known as Bishop's Lynn, the town being in the hands of  the Bishop of Norwich. Bishop Herbert de Losinga built the church of  St. Margaret at the beginning of the twelfth century, and gave it with  many privileges to the monks of Norwich, who held a priory at Lynn;  and Bishop Turbus did a wonderfully good stroke of business, reclaimed  a large tract of land about 1150 A.D., and amassed wealth for his see  from his markets, fairs, and mills. Another bishop, Bishop Grey,  induced or compelled King John to grant a free charter to the town,  but astutely managed to keep all the power in his own hands. Lynn was  always a very religious place, and most of the orders--Benedictines,  Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelite and Augustinian Friars, and the  Sack Friars--were represented at Lynn, and there were numerous  hospitals, a lazar-house, a college of secular canons, and other  religious institutions, until they were all swept away by the greed of  a rapacious king. There is not much left to-day of all these religious  foundations. The latest authority on the history of Lynn, Mr. H.J.  Hillen, well says: \"Time's unpitying plough-share has spared few  vestiges of their architectural* grandeur.\" A cemetery cross in the  museum, the name \"Paradise\" that keeps up the remembrance of the cool,  verdant cloister-garth, a brick arch upon the east bank of the Nar,  and a similar gateway in \"Austin\" Street are all the relics that  remain of the old monastic life, save the slender hexagonal \"Old  Tower,\" the graceful lantern of the convent of the grey-robed  Franciscans. The above writer also points out the beautifully carved  door in Queen Street, sole relic of the College of Secular Canons,  from which the chisel of the ruthless iconoclast has chipped off the  obnoxious _Orate pro anima_.      *Transcriber's Note: Original \"achitectural\"    The quiet, narrow, almost deserted streets of Lynn, its port and quays  have another story to tell. They proclaim its former greatness as one  of the chief ports in England and the centre of vast mercantile  activity. A thirteenth-century historian, Friar William Newburg,  described Lynn as \"a noble city noted for its trade.\" It was the key  of Norfolk. Through it flowed all the traffic to and from northern  East Anglia, and from its harbour crowds of ships carried English  produce, mainly wool, to the Netherlands, Norway, and the Rhine  Provinces. Who would have thought that this decayed harbour ranked  fourth among the ports of the kingdom? But its glories have departed.  Decay set in. Its prosperity began to decline.    Railways have been the ruin of King's Lynn. The merchant princes who  once abounded in the town exist here no longer. The last of the long  race died quite recently. Some ancient ledgers still exist in the  town, which exhibit for one firm alone a turnover of something like a  million and a half sterling per annum. Although possessed of a  similarly splendid waterway, unlike Ipswich, the trade of the town  seems to have quite decayed. Few signs of commerce are visible, except  where the advent of branch stations of enterprising \"Cash\" firms has  resulted in the squaring up of odd projections and consequent  overthrow of certain ancient buildings. There is one act of vandalism  which the town has never ceased to regret and which should serve as a  warning for the future. This is the demolition of the house of Walter  Coney, merchant, an unequalled specimen of fifteenth-century domestic  architecture, which formerly stood at the corner of the Saturday  Market Place and High Street. So strongly was this edifice constructed  that it was with the utmost difficulty that it was taken to pieces, in  order to make room for the ugly range of white brick buildings which  now stands upon its site. But Lynn had an era of much prosperity  during the rise of the Townshends, when the agricultural improvements  brought about by the second Viscount introduced much wealth to  Norfolk. Such buildings as the Duke's Head Hotel belong to the second  Viscount's time, and are indicative of the influx of visitors which  the town enjoyed. In the present day this hotel, though still a  good-sized establishment, occupies only half the building which it  formerly did. An interesting oak staircase of fine proportions, though  now much warped, may be seen here.    [Illustration: Half-timbered House with early Fifteenth-century  Doorway, King's Lynn, Norfolk]    In olden days the Hanseatic League had an office here. The Jews were  plentiful and supplied capital--you can find their traces in the name  of the \"Jews' Lane Ward\"--and then came the industrious Flemings, who  brought with them the art of weaving cloth and peculiar modes of  building houses, so that Lynn looks almost like a little Dutch town.  The old guild life of Lynn was strong and vigorous, from its Merchant  Guild to the humbler craft guilds, of which we are told that there  have been no less than seventy-five. Part of the old Guildhall,  erected in 1421, with its chequered flint and stone gable still stands  facing the market of St. Margaret with its Renaissance porch, and a  bit of the guild hall of St. George the Martyr remains in King Street.  The custom-house, which was originally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#7)"],[1," the Child=    For several reasons, there has been a change in the relationship that  used to exist between teacher and child. Earlier the teacher lived in,  and was part of, the community and so knew something of local conditions  and the tensions of his pupils' lives. This gave him a more intimate  knowledge and sympathetic understanding of a child's difficulties.    Today in the cities, and particularly in the quickly growing urban  areas, there are different conditions. Schools are new and big, without  a tradition of long community service; teachers have difficulty in  finding accommodation in the district from which their pupils come; to  meet the shortage of permanent staff many partially trained persons have  to be used as relieving teachers; even qualified teachers have to move  frequently to meet promotion requirements.    As a result the knowledge that once came to a teacher from sharing the  same environment as the child has now to be acquired in some other way  and, probably, from within the school. This knowledge is of great  importance in diagnosing maladjustments that might lead to delinquency.    In primary schools the situation is met by the establishment of a  system of visiting teachers who can investigate the circumstances of a  problem child. Perhaps of greater importance, the presence of visiting  teachers reminds class teachers that children have difficulties out of  school. The Committee feels that:      (_a_) As many of the problems have a medical origin, there should    be as much official liaison as possible between the public health    nurses and the visiting teachers. This would automatically make    the services of a medical officer available.      (_b_) Particularly in rapidly growing industrial areas, the number    of visiting teachers should be increased.    In pos  t-primary schools there is at present no official system of  linking the home and school in the investigation of problems.  Traditionally the headmaster has done this, but with the increase in the  size and complexity of schools he has now too little time for this work.    Post-primary principals, in their evidence, appeared worried by the  problems of conduct arising from the inability of pupils to leave school  until they have reached fifteen years of age. It has already been shown  that the pattern of juvenile delinquency which is the subject of this  investigation is found particularly in this age group.    It therefore seems desirable that some help should be given to  post-primary schools. The Committee makes no specific recommendation[2]  how this should be done, although it is emphatically of the opinion that  there is a need for this help, and that the personality of those doing  the work is of more importance than the question as to which  organization should control them.    This is only the immediate step. Everything possible should be done to  restore the community bond between teacher, parent, and child--by the  stabilizing of the teaching service, by the provision of houses for  teachers in newly developed areas, and by continuing the effort to  increase the number of women in the service.      =(2) Co-education=    At the hearing of the immorality charges in the Court at Lower Hutt the  prosecuting officer attributed the delinquency, in part, to the  association of boys and girls in co-educational schools. This directed  the attention of the Committee to the effect on morality of the  propinquity of the sexes in schools.    There seemed to be no disagreement on the question of educating boys and  girls of primary-school age together. The desirability of co-education  at the post-primary school level, however, was frequently disputed. Many  opinions were heard, for and against.    The Committee was not concerned with the relative values of the  different types of school, except in so far as they had an effect on  juvenile delinquency.    Statements were made that co-educational schools did, in fact, increase  the chances of immorality, but although the Committee investigated these  charges it could not find that acts of immorality among pupils did in  fact arise from their association at school.    There was evidence that one girl had incited seven boys to sexual  misbehaviour on the way home from a co-educational school. Thorough  investigation proved to the Committee that the group came from the same  neighbourhood and had become known to one another from their home and  street association. Acts of indecency had occurred long before they went  to the post-primary school.    Senior pupils of an intermediate school were concerned in depravity,  both heterosexual and homosexual. The trouble probably spread through  the acquaintanceships made at school, but in all cases the history of  the instigators, in intelligence and environment, showed either that  they were already concerned in immoral acts outside the school or that  they had home circumstances conducive to delinquency.    In many of the cases that were brought to the notice of the Committee  the name of the school was associated with the offender, even although  the offences did not occur within the school or arise from it. This  linking of the school with the offender is unfortunate, as it is  unsettling to the other pupils of the school and disturbing to the  parents of the district.      =(3) School Leaving Age=    The school leaving age is now 15, but there are obviously some pupils,  in the upper forms of primary schools and the lower in post-primary,  who, either through lack of ability or lack of interest, are not only  [not][3] deriving \"appreciable benefit\" from their further education,  but are indeed unsettling and sometimes dangerous to other children.    The School Age Regulations (1943/202) permit of exemption from  attendance at school in cases where the Senior Inspector of Schools in  any district certifies that a child of 14 who has completed the work of  Form II is not likely to derive any appreciable benefit from the  facilities available at a convenient school or the Correspondence  School.    The Committee recommends:      (_a_) That the Department should consider whether some better    method of educating these children can be evolved. It feels that    the mere granting of an exemption certificate may transfer the    problem from the school, where there is at least formal oversight,    to the community, where this is not the case.      (_b_) Where the underlying reason for exemption is the misconduct    of the child, the Senior Inspector should have power to grant the    exemption subject to the child being supervised by the Child    Welfare Division of the Department.      =(4) Relations With the Child Welfare Division=    From the evidence received it is clear that principals of schools would  welcome a closer liaison, by regulation, with the Child Welfare  Division. A high degree of co-operation already exists in some places,  but it depends on the personalities of the people concerned and is not  general.    With a full realization of the desirability of secrecy in the affairs of  a delinquent child, but also with the knowledge that the principal of a  school should know as much as possible of his pupils, and in most cases  has known them longer, and in conditions of less tension than the Child  Welfare Officer, it is suggested that:      (_a_) Where a child in a school, or transferred to it, has come to    the notice of the Child Welfare Division for acts of delinquency,    the principal of the new school should be informed.      (_b_) Where a pupil is to be charged before the Children's Court    the principal should be asked to make a recommendation regarding    the future of the child either independently of, or jointly with,    that of the Child Welfare Officer. At the present time the    principal is merely asked to report to the Child Welfare Officer,    although, from his longer experience of the child, he may be in a    better position than that officer to suggest what should be done.      =(5) Sex Instruction in School=    The views of the Committee on the whole subject of sex instruction are  given elsewhere in the report. Here it is emphasized that, apart from  the biological aspect as a part of nature study in the primary schools  and general science in the post-primary schools, the school in general  is not the place for class instruction in sex matters.    Incidental features of sex hygiene will arise naturally from physical  education and can be adequately treated there.    It is felt that the teaching of the fuller aspects of the sex relation  between men and women requires an emotional link between the teacher and  the taught, and it should not be looked on as a duty of the school to  forge this link. But where ignorance persists, through the failure of  the natural agencies, the school should try, if a suitable person is  available on the staff, or by the employment of a specialist, to remedy  the omission.      =(6) \"New Education\"=    Several witnesses have claimed that the philosophy underlying the New  Zealand education system is a predisposing cause of sexual delinquency,  but in the absence of direct evidence, which is obviously difficult to  obtain, such claims can only be an expression of personal opinion.  Similarly, the terms \"play way\" and \"free expression\" have been quoted  to show that traditional external disciplines have given way to a  concentration on the development of the personality of the child--a  development which could lead to licence. But as there are not sufficient  comparative figures available for New Zealand, and as reports from  overseas suggest that the pattern of immorality is a world-wide one, the  Committee is unable to reach a conclusion on this matter.    It does, however, feel justified in suggesting that nothing but benefit  could come from representatives of the Department of Education attending  meetings of Parent-Teacher and Home-and-School Associations to"]]]
