[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1361"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Giant Cannon; Or, The Longest Shots on Record (#7)"],[1,"soon.\"    I might explain, briefly, for the benefit of you boys who have never  seen a big, modern cannon, that it consists of a central core of cast  steel. This is rifled, just as a small rifle is bored, with twisted  grooves throughout its length. The grooves, or rifling, impart a  twisting motion to the projectiles, and keep them in a straighter line.    After the central core is made and rifled, thick jackets of steel are  \"shrunk\" on over the rear part of the gun. Sometimes several jackets  are put on, one over the other, to make the gun stronger.    If you have ever seen a blacksmith put a tire on a wheel you will  understand what I mean. The tire is heated, and this expands it, or  makes it larger. It is put on hot, and when it cools it shrinks,  getting smaller, and gripping the rim of the wheel in a strong embrace.  That is what the jackets of steel do to the big guns.    A big rifled cannon is loaded from the rear, or breech, just as is a  breech-loading shotgun or rifle. That is, the cannon is opened at the  back and the projectile is put in by means of a derrick, for often the  projectiles weigh a thousand pounds or more. Next comes the  powder--hundreds of pounds of it--and then it is necessary to close the  breech.    The breech block does this. That block is a ponderous piece of steel,  quite complicated, and it swings on a hinge fastened to one side of the  rear of the gun. Once it is swung back into place, it is made fast by  means of screw threads, wedges or in whatever way the inventor of the  gun deems best.    The breech block must be very strong, and held firmly in place, or the  terrific force of the powder would blow it out, wreck the gun and kill  those behind it. You see, the breech block really stands a great part  of the strain. The powder is between it and the projectile, and there  is a sort of warfare to see which will give way--the projectile or the  block. In most cases the projectile gracefully bows, so to speak, and  skips out of the muzzle of the gun, though sometimes the big breech  block will be shattered.    With eager eyes Tom and Ned watched the preparations for firing the big  gun. The charge of powder was hoisted out of the bomb-proof chamber  below the barbette, and then the great projectile was brought up in  slings. At the sight of that Tom realized that the gun was no ordinary  one, for the great piece of steel was nearly three feet long, and must  have weighed nearly a thousand pounds. Truly, much powder would be  needed to send that on its way.    \"I'm afraid, General, that you are using too much of that strong  powder,\" Tom heard one officer say to the inventor of the gun. \"It may  burst the breech.\"    \"Nonsense, Colonel Washburn. I tell you it is impossible to burst my  gun--impossible, sir! I have allowed for every emergency, and  calculated every strain. I have a margin of safety equal to fifty per  cent.\"    \"Very well, I hope it proves a success.\"    \"Of course it will. It is impossible to burst my gun! Now, are we ready  for the test.\"    The gun was rather crude in form, not having received its final polish,  and it was mounted on a temporary carriage. But even with that Tom  could see that it was a wonderful weapon, though he thought he would  have put on another jacket toward the muzzle, to further strengthen  that portion.    \"I'm going to make a gun bigger than that,\" said Tom to Ned. He spoke  rather louder than he intended, and, as it was at a moment when there  was a period of silence, the words carried to General Waller, who was  at that moment near Tom.    \"What's that?\" inquired the rather fiery-tempered officer, as he looked  sharply at our hero.    \"I said I was going to make a larger gun than that,\" repeated Tom,  modestly.    \"Sir! Do you know what you are saying? How did you come in here,  anyhow? I thought no civilians were to be admitted today!  Explain how  you got here!\"    Tom felt an angry flush mounting to his cheeks.    \"I came in here on a pass countersigned by you,\" he replied.    \"A pass countersigned by me? Let me see it.\"    Tom passed it over.    \"Humph, it doesn't seem to be forged,\" went on the pompous officer.  \"Who are you, anyhow?\"    \"Tom Swift.\"    \"Hum!\"    \"General Waller, permit me to introduce Tom Swift to you,\" spoke  Captain Badger, stepping forward, and trying not to smile.  \"He is one  of our foremost inventors. It is his type of monoplane that the  government has adopted for the coming maneuvers at Panama, you may  recall, and he was very helpful to Uncle Sam in stopping that swindling  on the border last year--Tom and his big searchlight. Mr. Swift,  General Waller,\" and Captain Badger bowed as he completed the  introduction.    \"What's that. Tom Swift here? Let me meet him!\" exclaimed an elderly  officer coming through the crowd. The others parted to make way for  him, as he seemed to be a person of some importance, to judge by his  uniform, and the medals he wore.    \"Tom Swift here!\" he went on. \"I want to shake hands with you, Tom! I  haven't seen you since I negotiated with you for the purchase of those  submarines you invented, and which have done such splendid service for  the government. Tom, I'm glad to see you here today.\"    The face of General Waller was a study in blank amazement.          CHAPTER VII    THE IMPOSSIBLE OCCURS      There were murmurs throughout the throng about the big gun, as the  officer approached Tom Swift and shook hands with him.    \"What have you in mind now, Tom, that you come to Sandy Hook?\" the  much-medaled officer asked.    \"Nothing much, Admiral,\" answered our hero.    \"Oh, yes, you have!\" returned Admiral Woodburn, head of the naval  forces of Uncle Sam. \"You've got some idea in your head, or you  wouldn't come to see this test of my friend's gun. Well, if you can  invent anything as good for coast defense, or even interior defense, as  your submarines, it will be in keeping with what you have done in the  past. I congratulate you, General Waller, on having Tom Swift here to  give you the benefit of some of his ideas.\"    \"I--I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Swift before,\" said the  gun inventor, stiffly. \"I did not recognize his name when I  countersigned his pass.\"    It was plain that the greeting of Tom by Admiral Woodburn had had a  marked effect in changing sentiment toward our hero.  Captain Badger  smiled as he noticed with what different eyes the gun inventor now  regarded the lad.    \"Well, if Tom Swift gives you any points about your gun, you want to  adopt them,\" went on the Admiral. \"I thought I knew something about  submarines, but Tom taught me some things, too; didn't you, Tom?\"    \"Oh, it was just a simple matter, Admiral,\" said Tom, modestly.  \"Just  that little point about the intake valves and the ballast tanks.\"    \"But they changed the whole matter. Yes, General, you take Tom's  advice--if he gives you any.\"    \"I don't know that I will need any--as yet,\" replied General Waller. \"I  am confident my gun will be a success as it is at present constructed.  Later, however, if I should decide to make any changes, I will gladly  avail myself of Mr. Swift's counsel,\" and he bowed stiffly to Tom. \"We  will now proceed with the test,\" he went on. \"Kindly send a wireless to  the patrol ships that we are about to fire, and ask them to note  carefully where the projectile falls.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" spoke the officer in immediate charge of the matter,  as he saluted. Soon from the aerials snapped the vicious sparks that  told of the wireless telegraph being worked.    I might explain that near the spot where the projectile was expected to  fall into the sea--about fifteen miles from Sandy Hook--several war  vessels were stationed to warn shipping to give the place a wide berth.  This was easy, since the big gun had been aimed at a spot outside of  the steamship lanes. Aiming the rifle in a certain direction, and  giving it a definite angle of inclination, made it practically certain  just where the shot would fall. This is called \"getting the range,\" and  while, of course, the exact limit of fire of the new gun was not known,  it had been computed as nearly as possible.    \"Is everything ready now?\" asked General Waller, while Tom was  conversing with his friends, Captain Badger and Admiral Woodburn, Ned  taking part in the conversation from time to time.    \"All ready, sir,\" was the assurance. The inventor was plainly nervous  as the crucial moment of the test approached. He went here and there  upon the barbette, testing the various levers and gear wheels of the  gun.    The projectile and powder had been put in, the breech-block screwed  into place, the primer had been inserted, and all that remained was to  press the button that would make the electrical connection, and explode  the charge. This act of firing the gun had been intrusted to one of the  soldiers, for General Waller and his brother officers were to retire to  a bomb-proof, whence they would watch the effect of the fire, and note  the course of the projectile.    \"It seems to me,\" remarked Ned, \"that the soldier who is going to fire  the gun is in the most danger.\"    \"He would be--if it exploded,\" spoke Tom, for his officer friends had  joined their colleagues, most of whom were now walking toward the  shelter. \"But I think there is little danger.    \"You see, the electric wires are long enough to enable him to stand  some distance from the gun. And, if he likes, he can crouch behind that  concrete wall of the next barbette. Still, there is some chance of an  accident, for, no matter how carefully you calculate the strain of a  bursting charge of powder, and how strongly you construct the  breech-block to stand the strain, there is always the possibility of a  flaw in the metal. So, Ned, I think we'll just go to the bomb-proof  ourselves, when we see General Waller making for the same place.\"    \"I suppose,\" remarked Ned, \"that in actual warfare anyone who fired one  of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"Nias in the Indian Ocean      are \"modest by nature,\" paying no attention to their own nudity      or that of others, and much scandalized by any attempt to go      beyond the limits ordained by custom. When they pass near places      where women are bathing they raise their voices in order to warn      them of their presence, and even although any bold youth      addressed the women, and the latter replied, no attempt would be      made to approach them; any such attempt would be severely      punished by the head man of the village. (Modigliani, _Un Viaggio      a Nias_, p. 460.)        Man says that the Andamanese in modesty and self-respect compare      favorably with many classes among civilized peoples. \"Women are      so modest that they will not renew their leaf-aprons in the      presence of one another, but retire to a secluded spot for this      purpose; even when parting with one of their _bod_ appendages      [tails of leaves suspended from back of girdle] to a female      friend, the delicacy they manifest for the feelings of the      bystanders in their mode of removing it amounts to prudishness;      yet they wear no clothing in the ordinary sense.\" (_Journal of      the Anthropological Institute_, 1883, pp. 94 and 331.)        Of the Garo women of Bengal Dalton says: \"Their sole garment is a      piece of cloth less than a foot in width that just meets around      the loins, and in order that it may not restrain the limbs it is      only fastened where it meets under the hip at the upper corners.      The girls are thus greatly restricted in the positions they may      modestly assume, but decorum is, in their opinion, sufficiently      preserved if they only keep their legs well together when they      sit or kneel.\" (E.T. Dalton, _Ethnology of Bengal_, 1872, p. 66.)        Of the Naga women of Assam it is said: \"Of clothing there was not      much to see; but in spite of this I doubt whether we could excel      them in true decency and modesty. Ibn Muhammed Wali had already      remarked in his history of the conquest of Assam (1662-63), that      the Naga women only cover their breasts. They declare that it is      absurd to cover those parts of the body which everyone has been      able to see from their births, but that it is different with the      breasts, which appeared later, and are, therefore, to be covered.      Dalton (_Journal of the Asiatic Society_, Bengal, 41, 1, 84) adds      that in the presence of strangers Naga women simply cross their      arms over their breasts, without caring much what other charms      they may reveal to the observer. As regards some clans of the      naked Nagas, to whom the Banpara belong, this may still hold      good.\" (K. Klemm, \"Peal's Ausflug nach Banpara,\" _Zeitschrift fuer      Ethnologie_, 1898, Heft 5, p. 334.)        \"In Ceylon, a woman always bathes in public streams, but she      never removes all her clothes. She washes under the cloth, bit by      bit, and then slips on the dry, new cloth, and pulls out the wet      one from underneath (much in the same sliding way as servant      girls and young women in England). This is the common custom in      India and the Malay States. The breasts are always bare in their      own houses, but in the public roads are covered whenever a      European passes. The vulva is never exposed. They say that a      devil, imagined as a white and hairy being, might have      intercourse with them.\" (Private communication.)        In Borneo, \"the _sirat_, called _chawal_ by the Malays, is a      strip of cloth a yard wide, worn round the loins and in between      the thighs, so as to cover the pudenda and perinaeum; it is      generally six yards or so in length, but the younger men of the      present generation use as much as twelve or fourteen yards      (sometimes even more), which they twist and coil with great      precision round and round their body, until the waist and stomach      are fully enveloped in its folds.\" (H. Ling Roth, \"Low's Natives      of Borneo,\" _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1892, p.      36.)        \"In their own houses in the depths of the forest the Dwarfs are      said to neglect coverings for decency in the men as in the women,      but certainly when they emerge from the forest into the villages      of the agricultural Negroes, they are always observed to be      wearing some small piece of bark-cloth or skin, or a bunch of      leaves over the pudenda. Elsewhere in all the regions of Africa      visited by the writer, or described by other observers, a neglect      of decency in the male has only been recorded among the Efik      people of Old Calabar. The nudity of women is another question.      In parts of West Africa, between the Niger and the Gaboon      (especially on the Cameroon River, at Old Calabar, and in the      Niger Delta), it is, or was, customary for young women to go      about completely nude before they were married. In Swaziland,      until quite recently, unmarried women and very often matrons went      stark naked. Even amongst the prudish Baganda, who made it a      punishable offense for a man to expose any part of his leg above      the knee, the wives of the King would attend at his Court      perfectly naked. Among the Kavirondo, all unmarried girls are      completely nude, and although women who have become mothers are      supposed to wear a tiny covering before and behind, they very      often completely neglect to do so when in their own villages.      Yet, as a general rule, among the Nile Negroes, and still more      markedly among the Hamites and people of Masai stock, the women      are particular about concealing the pudenda, whereas the men are      ostentatiously naked. The Baganda hold nudity in the male to be      such an abhorrent thing that for centuries they have referred      with scorn and disgust to the Nile Negroes as the 'naked people.'      Male nudity extends northwest to within some 200 miles of      Khartum, or, in fact, wherever the Nile Negroes of the      Dinka-Acholi stock inhabit the country.\" (Sir H.H. Johnston,      _Uganda Protectorate_, vol. ii, pp. 669-672.)        Among the Nilotic Ja-luo, Johnston states that \"unmarried men go      naked. Married men who have children wear a small piece of goat      skin, which, though quite inadequate for purposes of decency, is,      nevertheless, a very important thing in etiquette, for a married      man with a child must on no account call on his mother-in-law      without wearing this piece of goat's skin. To call on her in a      state of absolute nudity would be regarded as a serious insult,      only to be atoned for by the payment of goats. Even if under the      new dispensation he wears European trousers, he must have a piece      of goat's skin underneath. Married women wear a tail of strings      behind.\" It is very bad manners for a woman to serve food to her      husband without putting on this tail. (Sir H.H. Johnston, _Uganda      Protectorate_, vol. ii, p. 781.)        Mrs. French-Sheldon remarks that the Masai and other East African      tribes, with regard to menstruation, \"observe the greatest      delicacy, and are more than modest.\" (_Journal of the      Anthropological Institute_, 1894, p. 383.)        At the same time the Masai, among whom the penis is of enormous      size, consider it disreputable to conceal that member, and in the      highest degree reputable to display it, even ostentatiously. (Sir      H.H. Johnston, _Kilima-njaro Expedition_, p. 413.)        Among the African Dinka, who are scrupulously clean and delicate      (smearing themselves with burnt cows' dung, and washing      themselves daily with cows' urine), and are exquisite cooks,      reaching in many respects a higher stage of civilization, in      Schweinfurth's opinion, than is elsewhere attained in Africa,      only the women wear aprons. The neighboring tribes of the red      soil--Bongo, Mittoo, Niam-Niam, etc.--are called \"women\" by the      Dinka, because among these tribes the men wear an apron, while      the women obstinately refuse to wear any clothes whatsoever of      skin or stuff, going into the woods every day, however, to get a      supple bough for a girdle, with, perhaps, a bundle of fine grass.      (Schweinfurth, _Heart of Africa_, vol. i, pp. 152, etc.)        Lombroso and Carrara, examining some Dinka negroes brought from      the White Nile, remark: \"As to their psychology, what struck us      first was the exaggeration of their modesty; not in a single case      would the men allow us to examine their genital organs or the      women their breasts; we examined the tattoo-marks on the chest of      one of the women, and she remained sad and irritable for two days      afterward.\" They add that in sexual and all other respects these      people are highly moral. (Lombroso and Carrara, _Archivio di      Psichiatria_, 1896, vol. xvii, fasc. 4.)        \"The negro is very rarely knowingly indecent or addicted to      lubricity,\" says Sir H.H. Johnston. \"In this land of nudity,      which I have known for seven years, I do not remember once having      seen an indecent gesture on the part of either man or woman, and      only very rarely (and that not among unspoiled savages) in the      case of that most shameless member of the community--the little      boy.\" He adds that the native dances are only an apparent      exception, being serious in character, though indecent to our      eyes, almost constituting a religious ceremony. The only really      indecent dance indigenous to Central Africa \"is one which      originally represented the act of coition, but it is so altered      to a stereotyped formula that its exact purport is not obvious      until explained somewhat shyly by the natives.... It may safely      be asserted that the negro race in Central Africa is much more      truly modest, is much more free from real vice, than are"]]]
