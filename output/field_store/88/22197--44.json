However, in a small time afterwards he  recovered, and I was again sold. I was now carried to the left of the  sun's rising, through many different countries, and a number of large  woods. The people I was sold to used to carry me very often, when I  was tired, either on their shoulders or on their backs. I saw many  convenient well-built sheds along the roads, at proper distances, to  accommodate the merchants and travellers, who lay in those buildings  along with their wives, who often accompany them; and they always go  well armed.    From the time I left my own nation I always found somebody that  understood me till I came to the sea coast. The languages of different  nations did not totally differ, nor were they so copious as those of  the Europeans, particularly the English. They were therefore easily  learned; and, while I was journeying thus through Africa, I acquired  two or three different tongues. In this manner I had been travelling  for a considerable time, when one evening, to my great surprise, whom  should I see brought to the house where I was but my dear sister! As  soon as she saw me she gave a loud shriek, and ran into my arms--I was  quite overpowered: neither of us could speak; but, for a considerable  time, clung to each other in mutual embraces, unable to do any thing  but weep. Our meeting affected all who saw us; and indeed I must  acknowledge, in honour of those sable destroyers of human rights, that  I never met with any ill treatment, or saw any offered to their  slaves, except tying them, when necessary, to keep them from running  away. When these people knew we were brother and sister they indulged  us together; and the man, to whom I supposed we belonged, lay with us,  he in the middle, while she and I held one another by the hands across  his breast all night; and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes  in the joy of being together: but even this small comfort was soon to  have an end; for scarcely had the fatal morning appeared, when she was  again torn from me for ever! I was now more miserable, if possible,  than before. The small relief which her presence gave me from pain was  gone, and the wretchedness of my situation was redoubled by my anxiety  after her fate, and my apprehensions lest her sufferings should be  greater than mine, when I could not be with her to alleviate them.  Yes, thou dear partner of all my childish sports! thou sharer of my  joys and sorrows! happy should I have ever esteemed myself to  encounter every misery for you, and to procure your freedom by the  sacrifice of my own. Though you were early forced from my arms, your  image has been always rivetted in my heart, from which neither _time  nor fortune_ have been able to remove it; so that, while the thoughts  of your sufferings have damped my prosperity, they have mingled with  adversity and increased its bitterness. To that Heaven which protects  the weak from the strong, I commit the care of your innocence and  virtues, if they have not already received their full reward, and if  your youth and delicacy have not long since fallen victims to the  violence of the African trader, the pestilential stench of a Guinea  ship, the seasoning in the European colonies, or the lash and lust of  a brutal and unrelenting overseer.    I did not long remain after my sister. I was again sold, and carried  through a number of places, till, after travelling a considerable  time, I came to a town called Tinmah, in the most beautiful country I  have yet seen in Africa. It was extremely rich, and there were many  rivulets which flowed through it, and supplied a large pond in the  centre of the town, where the people washed. Here I first saw and  tasted cocoa-nuts, which I thought superior to any nuts I had ever  tasted before; and the trees, which were loaded, were also  interspersed amongst the houses, which had commodious shades  adjoining, and were in the same manner as ours, the insides being  neatly plastered and whitewashed. Here I also saw and tasted for the  first time sugar-cane. Their money consisted of little white shells,  the size of the finger nail. I was sold here for one hundred and  seventy-two of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there. I  had been about two or three days at his house, when a wealthy widow, a  neighbour of his, came there one evening, and brought with her an only  son, a young gentleman about my own age and size. Here they saw me;  and, having taken a fancy to me, I was bought of the merchant, and  went home with them. Her house and premises were situated close to one  of those rivulets I have mentioned, and were the finest I ever saw in  Africa: they were very extensive, and she had a number of slaves to  attend her. The next day I was washed and perfumed, and when meal-time  came I was led into the presence of my mistress, and ate and drank  before her with her son. This filled me with astonishment; and I could  scarce help expressing my surprise that the young gentleman should  suffer me, who was bound, to eat with him who was free; and not only  so, but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till I had  taken first, because I was the eldest, which was agreeable to our  custom. Indeed every thing here, and all their treatment of me, made  me forget that I was a slave. The language of these people resembled  ours so nearly, that we understood each other perfectly. They had also  the very same customs as we. There were likewise slaves daily to  attend us, while my young master and I with other boys sported with  our darts and bows and arrows, as I had been used to do at home. In  this resemblance to my former happy state I passed about two months;  and I now began to think I was to be adopted into the family, and was  beginning to be reconciled to my situation, and to forget by degrees  my misfortunes, when all at once the delusion vanished; for, without  the least previous knowledge, one morning early, while my dear master  and companion was still asleep, I was wakened out of my reverie to  fresh sorrow, and hurried away even amongst the uncircumcised.    Thus, at the very moment I dreamed of the greatest happiness, I found  myself most miserable; and it seemed as if fortune wished to give me  this taste of joy, only to render the reverse more poignant. The  change I now experienced was as painful as it was sudden and  unexpected. It was a change indeed from a state of bliss to a scene  which is inexpressible by me, as it discovered to me an element I had  never before beheld, and till then had no idea of, and wherein such  instances of hardship and cruelty continually occurred as I can never  reflect on but with horror.    All the nations and people I had hitherto passed through resembled our  own in their manners, customs, and language: but I came at length to a  country, the inhabitants of which differed from us in all those  particulars. I was very much struck with this difference, especially  when I came among a people who did not circumcise, and ate without  washing their hands. They cooked also in iron pots, and had European  cutlasses and cross bows, which were unknown to us, and fought with  their fists amongst themselves. Their women were not so modest as  ours, for they ate, and drank, and slept, with their men. But, above  all, I was amazed to see no sacrifices or offerings among them. In  some of those places the people ornamented themselves with scars, and  likewise filed their teeth very sharp. They wanted sometimes to  ornament me in the same manner, but I would not suffer them; hoping  that I might some time be among a people who did not thus disfigure  themselves, as I thought they did. At last I came to the banks of a  large river, which was covered with canoes, in which the people  appeared to live with their household utensils and provisions of all  kinds. I was beyond measure astonished at this, as I had never before  seen any water larger than a pond or a rivulet: and my surprise was  mingled with no small fear when I was put into one of these canoes,  and we began to paddle and move along the river. We continued going on  thus till night; and when we came to land, and made fires on the  banks, each family by themselves, some dragged their canoes on shore,  others stayed and cooked in theirs, and laid in them all night. Those  on the land had mats, of which they made tents, some in the shape of  little houses: in these we slept; and after the morning meal we  embarked again and proceeded as before. I was often very much  astonished to see some of the women, as well as the men, jump into the  water, dive to the bottom, come up again, and swim about. Thus I  continued to travel, sometimes by land, sometimes by water, through  different countries and various nations, till, at the end of six or  seven months after I had been kidnapped, I arrived at the sea coast.  It would be tedious and uninteresting to relate all the incidents  which befell me during this journey, and which I have not yet  forgotten; of the various hands I passed through, and the manners and  customs of all the different people among whom I lived: I shall  therefore only observe, that in all the places where I was the soil  was exceedingly rich; the pomkins, eadas, plantains, yams, &c. &c.  were in great abundance, and of incredible size. There were also vast  quantities of different gums, though not used for any purpose; and  every where a great deal of tobacco. The cotton even grew quite wild;  and there was plenty of redwood. I saw no mechanics whatever in all  the way, except such as I have mentioned. The chief employment in all  these countries was agriculture, and both the males and females, as  with us, were brought up to it, and trained in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15435"],[0,"Object Lessons on the Human Body (#7)"],[1,"8.

When my food is chewed, it is rolled by my tongue into the oesophagus,  or food-pipe, which is back of my windpipe, and leads from my mouth down  along the side of my spine, to the left and upper end of my stomach.    2. My stomach is an oblong, soft, and fleshy bag, extending from my left to  my right side, below my lungs and heart.    3. It is composed of three coats or membranes, and resembles tripe.    4. The _outer coat_ is smooth, thick, and tough. It supports and  strengthens the stomach.    5. The _middle coat_ is fibrous. Its fibres have the power of contracting,  sometimes pressing upon the food, and sometimes pushing it along toward the  opening which leads out of the stomach.    6. The _inner coat_ is soft, thick, spongy, and wrinkled. It prepares a  slimy substance and a fluid. The slimy substance prevents the stomach from  being irritated by the food. The fluid dissolves the food.    7. Food passes through several changes after it enters the mouth.    8. It is changed into pulp in the _mouth_, by the action of the teeth and  the saliva. This is called _mastication_. It is changed in the _stomach_,  by the action of the stomach and the gastric juice, into another kind of  pulp called _chyme_. The chyme is changed by the bile and another kind of  juice, called _pancreatic_ _juice_; these separate the nourishing from the  waste substance. The nourishing, milk-like substance is called _chyle_. The  waste substance passes from the body. The chyle is poured into a vein  behind the collar bone, and passes through the heart to the lungs, where it  is changed into blood.    9. If I would have a healthy stomach,      I must be careful what kind of food I eat,      I must be careful how much I eat,      I must be careful how I eat,      I must be careful when I eat.    10. I must eat wholesome food, good bread, ripe fruits, rather than rich  pies or jellies.    11. I must eat enough food, but not too much.    12. I must eat slowly,      I must masticate my food thoroughly,      I must masticate and swallow ray food without drinking    13. I must take my food regularly but not too often,      I must rest before and after eating, if possible,      I must not eat just before bedtime.    14. I must breathe pure air,      I must sit, stand, and walk erect,      I must not drink alcoholic liquors,      I must not snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco.           *       *       *       *       *    QUESTIONS FOR THE FORMULA.    1.
