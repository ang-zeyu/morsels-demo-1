[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#7)"],[1,"for bird snaring,\" I said. \"What strange bird are you  seeking--Karamaneh?\"    With a passionate gesture Karamaneh snatched off the veil, and with  it the ugly black hat. The cloud of wonderful, intractable hair came  rumpling about her face, and her glorious eyes blazed out upon me. How  beautiful they were, with the dark beauty of an Egyptian night; how  often had they looked into mine in dreams!    To labor against a ceaseless yearning for a woman whom one knows, upon  evidence that none but a fool might reject, to be worthless--evil; is  there any torture to which the soul of man is subject, more pitiless?  Yet this was my lot, for what past sins assigned to me I was unable to  conjecture; and this was the woman, this lovely slave of a monster, this  creature of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    \"I suppose you will declare that you do not know me!\" I said harshly.    Her lips trembled, but she made no reply.    \"It is very convenient to forget, sometimes,\" I ran on bitterly, then  checked myself; for I knew that my words were prompted by a feckless  desire to hear her defense, by a fool's hope that it might be an  acceptable one.    I looked again at the net contrivance in my hand; it had a strong spring  fitted to it and a line attached. Quite obviously it was intended for  snaring.    \"What were you about to do?\" I demanded sharply--but in my heart,  poor fool that I was, I found admiration for the exquisite arch of  Karamaneh's lips, and reproach because they were so tremulous.    She spoke then.    \"Dr. Petrie--\"    \"Well?\"    \"You seem to be--angry with me, not so much because of what I do, as  because I do not remember you. Yet--\"    \"Kindly do not revert to the matter,\" I interrupted. \"You have chosen,  very conveniently, to forget that once we were friends. Please yourself.  But answer my question.\"    She clasped her hands with a sort of wild abandon.    \"Why do you treat me so!\" she cried; she had the most fascinating accent  imaginable. \"Throw me into prison, kill me if you like, for what I have  done!\" She stamped her foot. \"For what I have done! But do not torture  me, try to drive me mad with your reproaches--that I forget you! I tell  you--again I tell you--that until you came one night, last week, to  rescue some one from--\" There was the old trick of hesitating before the  name of Fu-Manchu--\"from him, I had never, never seen you!\"    The dark eyes looked into mine, afire with a positive hunger for  belief--or so I was sorely tempted to suppose. But the facts were  against her.    \"Such a declaration is worthless,\" I said, as coldly as I could. \"You  are a traitress; you betray those who are mad enough to trust you--\"    \"I am no traitress!\" she blazed at me; her eyes were magnificent.    \"This is mere nonsense. You think that it will pay you better to serve  Fu-Manchu than to remain true to your friends. Your 'slavery'--for I  take it you are posing as a slave again--is evidently not very harsh.  You serve Fu-Manchu, lure men to their destruction, and in return he  loads you with jewels, lavishes gifts--\"    \"Ah! so!\"    She sprang forward, raising flaming eyes to mine; her lips were slightly  parted. With that wild abandon which betrayed the desert blood in her  veins, she wrenched open the neck of her bodice and slipped a soft  shoulder free of the garment. She twisted around, so that the white skin  was but inches removed from me.    \"These are some of the gifts that he lavishes upon me!\"    I clenched my teeth. Insane thoughts flooded my mind. For that creamy  skin was red with the marks of the lash!    She turned, quickly rearranging her dress, and watching me the while. I  could not trust myself to speak for a moment, then:    \"If I am a stranger to you, as you claim, why do you give me your  confidence?\" I asked.    \"I have known you long enough to trust you!\" she said simply, and turned  her head aside.    \"Then why do you serve this inhuman monster?\"    She snapped her fingers oddly, and looked up at me from under her  lashes. \"Why do you question me if you think that everything I say is a  lie?\"    It was a lesson in logic--from a woman! I changed the subject.    \"Tell me what you came here to do,\" I demanded.    She pointed to the net in my hands.    \"To catch birds; you have said so yourself.\"    \"What bird?\"    She shrugged her shoulders.    And now a memory was born within my brain; it was that of the cry of  the nighthawk which had harbingered the death of Forsyth! The net was  a large and strong one; could it be that some horrible fowl of the  air--some creature unknown to Western naturalists--had been released  upon the common last night? I thought of the marks upon Forsyth's face  and throat; I thought of the profound knowledge of obscure and dreadful  things possessed by the Chinaman.    The wrapping, in which the net had been, lay at my feet. I stooped and  took out from it a wicker basket. Karamaneh stood watching me and biting  her lip, but she made no move to check me. I opened the basket. It  contained a large phial, the contents of which possessed a pungent and  peculiar smell.    I was utterly mystified.    \"You will have to accompany me to my house,\" I said sternly.    Karamaneh upturned her great eyes to mine. They were wide with fear. She  was on the point of speaking when I extended my hand to grasp her. At  that, the look of fear was gone and one of rebellion held its place. Ere  I had time to realize her purpose, she flung back from me with that wild  grace which I had met with in no other woman, turned and ran!    Fatuously, net and basket in hand, I stood looking after her. The idea  of pursuit came to me certainly; but I doubted if I could have outrun  her. For Karamaneh ran, not like a girl used to town or even country  life, but with the lightness and swiftness of a gazelle; ran like the  daughter of the desert that she was.    Some two hundred yards she went, stopped, and looked back. It would seem  that the sheer joy of physical effort had aroused the devil in her, the  devil that must lie latent in every woman with eyes like the eyes of  Karamaneh.    In the ever brightening sunlight I could see the lithe figure swaying;  no rags imaginable could mask its beauty. I could see the red lips  and gleaming teeth. Then--and it was music good to hear, despite its  taunt--she laughed defiantly, turned, and ran again!    I resigned myself to defeat; I blush to add, gladly! Some evidences of  a world awakening were perceptible about me now. Feathered choirs hailed  the new day joyously. Carrying the mysterious contrivance which I had  captured from the enemy, I set out in the direction of my house, my mind  very busy with conjectures respecting the link between this bird snare  and the cry like that of a nighthawk which we had heard at the moment of  Forsyth's death.    The path that I had chosen led me around the border of the Mound Pond--a  small pool having an islet in the center. Lying at the margin of the  pond I was amazed to see the plate and jug which Nayland Smith had  borrowed recently!    Dropping my burden, I walked down to the edge of the water. I was filled  with a sudden apprehension. Then, as I bent to pick up the now empty  jug, came a hail:    \"All right, Petrie! Shall join you in a moment!\"    I started up, looked to right and left; but, although the voice had been  that of Nayland Smith, no sign could I discern of his presence!    \"Smith!\" I cried--\"Smith!\"    \"Coming!\"    Seriously doubting my senses, I looked in the direction from which the  voice had seemed to proceed--and there was Nayland Smith.    He stood on the islet in the center of the pond, and, as I perceived  him, he walked down into the shallow water and waded across to me!    \"Good heavens!\" I began--    One of his rare laughs interrupted me.    \"You must think me mad this morning, Petrie!\" he said. \"But I have made  several discoveries. Do you know what that islet in the pond really is?\"    \"Merely an islet, I suppose--\"    \"Nothing of the kind; it is a burial mound, Petrie! It marks the site of  one of the Plague Pits where victims were buried during the Great  Plague of London. You will observe that, although you have seen it every  morning for some years, it remains for a British Commissioner resident  in Burma to acquaint you with its history! Hullo!\"--the laughter was  gone from his eyes, and they were steely hard again--\"what the blazes  have we here!\"    He picked up the net. \"What! a bird trap!\"    \"Exactly!\" I said.    Smith turned his searching gaze upon me. \"Where did you find it,  Petrie?\"    \"I did not exactly find it,\" I replied; and I related to him the  circumstances of my meeting with Karamaneh.    He directed that cold stare upon me throughout the narrative, and when,  with some embarrassment, I had told him of the girl's escape--    \"Petrie,\" he said succinctly, \"you are an imbecile!\"    I flushed with anger, for not even from Nayland Smith, whom I esteemed  above all other men, could I accept such words uttered as he had uttered  them. We glared at one another.    \"Karamaneh,\" he continued coldly, \"is a beautiful toy, I grant you; but  so is a cobra. Neither is suitable for playful purposes.\"    \"Smith!\" I cried hotly--\"drop that! Adopt another tone or I cannot  listen to you!\"    \"You must listen,\" he said, squaring his lean jaw truculently. \"You are  playing, not only with a pretty girl who is the favorite of a Chinese  Nero, but with my life! And I object, Petrie, on purely personal  grounds!\"    I felt my anger oozing from me; for this was strictly just. I had  nothing to say, and Smith continued:    \"You know that she is utterly false, yet a glance or two from those dark  eyes of hers can make a fool of you! A woman made a fool of me, once;  but I learned my lesson; you have failed to learn yours. If you are  determined to go to pieces on the rock that broke up Adam, do so!

There was wailing on the early breeze, and darkness in the sky,    When, with sable plume, and cloak, and pall, a funeral train swept by;    Methought--St. Mary, shield us well!--that other forms moved there,    Than those of mortal brotherhood, the noble, young, and fair!      Was it a dream?--how oft, in sleep, we ask, \"Can this be true?\"    Whilst warm imagination paints her marvels to our view;--    Earth's glory seems a tarnish'd crown to that which we behold,    When dreams enchant our sight with things whose meanest garb is gold!      Was it a dream?--methought the \"dauntless Harold\" passed me by--    The proud \"Fitz-James,\" with martial step, and dark, intrepid eye;    That \"Marmion's\" haughty crest was there, a mourner for his sake;    And she, the bold, the beautiful, sweet \"Lady of the Lake.\"      The \"Minstrel,\" whose _last lay_ was o'er, whose broken harp lay low,    And with him glorious \"Waverley,\" with glance and step of wo;    And \"Stuart's\" voice rose there, as when, 'midst fate's disastrous war,    He led the wild, ambitious, proud, and brave \"Ich Ian Vohr.\"      Next, marvelling at his sable suit, the \"Dominie\" stalk'd past,    With \"Bertram,\" \"Julia\" by his side, whose tears were flowing fast;    \"Guy Mannering,\" too, moved there, o'erpowered by that afflicting sight;    And \"Merrilies,\" as when she wept on Ellangowan's height.      Solemn and grave, \"Monkbarns\" approached, amidst that burial line;    And \"Ochiltree\" leant o'er his staff, and mourn'd for \"Auld lang syne!\"    Slow march'd the gallant \"McIntyre,\" whilst \"Lovel\" mused alone;    For _once_, \"Miss Wardour's\" image left that bosom's faithful throne!      With coronach, and arms reversed, forth came \"MacGregor's\" clan--    Red \"Dougal's\" cry peal'd shrill and wild--\"Rob Roy's\" bold brow            look'd wan;    The fair \"Diana\" kissed her cross, and bless'd its sainted ray;    And \"Wae is me!\" the \"Bailie\" sighed, \"that I should see this day!\"      Next rode in melancholy guise, with sombre vest and scarf,    Sir Edward, Laird of Ellieslaw, the far-renowned \"Black Dwarf;\"    Upon his left, in bonnet blue, and white locks flowing free--    The pious sculptor of the grave--stood \"Old Mortality!\"      \"Balfour of Burley,\" of \"Claverhouse,\" the \"Lord of Evandale,\"    And stately \"Lady Margaret,\" whose woe might naught avail!    Fierce \"Bothwell\" on his charger black, as from the conflict won;    And pale \"Habakuk Mucklewrath,\" who cried, \"God's will be done!\"      And like a rose, a young white rose, that blooms mid wildest scenes,    Passed she,--the modest, eloquent, and virtuous \"Jeanie Deans;\"    And \"Dumbedikes,\" that silent laird, with love too _deep_ to _smile_,    And \"Effie,\" with her noble friend, the good \"Duke of Argyle.\"      With lofty brow, and bearing high, dark \"Ravenswood\" advanced,    Who on the false \"Lord Keeper's\" mien with eye indignant glanced;    Whilst graceful as a lonely fawn, 'neath covert close and sure,    Approached the beauty of all hearts--the \"Bride of Lammermoor!\"      Then \"Annot Lyle,\" the fairy queen of light and song, stepped near,    The \"Knight of Ardenvohr,\" and _he_, the gifted Hieland Seer:    \"Dalgetty,\" \"Duncan,\" \"Lord Monteith,\" and \"Ranald,\" met my view--    The hapless \"Children of the Mist,\" and bold \"Mhich-Connel-Dhu!\"      On swept \"Bois Guilbert\"--\"Front de Boeuf\"--\"De Bracy's\" plume of woe;    And \"Coeur de Lion's\" crest shone near the valiant \"Ivanhoe;\"    While soft as glides a summer cloud \"Rowena\" closer drew,    With beautiful \"Rebecca\"--peerless daughter of the Jew!      Still onward like the gathering night advanced that funeral train--    Like billows when the tempest sweeps across the shadowy main;    Where'er the eager gaze might reach, in noble ranks were seen,    Dark plume, and glittering mail and crest, and woman's beauteous mien!      A sound thrilled through that lengthening host! methought the vault            was closed,    Where in his glory and renown fair Scotia's bard reposed!--    A sound thrilled through that length'ning host! and forth my vision fled!    But, ah! that mournful dream proved true,--the immortal Scott was dead!    _Literary Gazette._           *       *       *       *       *      LORD BYRON'S \"LOVE.\"    _From Lady Blessington's Conversations._      Of love he had strange notions: he said that most people had _le  besoin d'aimer_, and that with this _besoin_ the first person who fell  in one's way contented one. He maintained that those who possessed the  most imagination, poets for example, were most likely to be constant  in their attachments, as with the _beau ideal_ in their heads, with  which they identified the object of their attachment, they had nothing  to desire, and viewed their mistresses through the brilliant medium of  fancy, instead of the common one of the eyes. \"A poet, therefore (said  Byron), endows the person he loves with all the charms with which his  mind is stored, and has no need of actual beauty to fill up the  picture. Hence he should select a woman, who is rather good-looking  than beautiful, leaving the latter for those who, having no  imagination, require actual beauty to satisfy their tastes. And after  all (said he), where is the actual beauty that can come up to the  bright 'imaginings' of the poet? where can one see women that equal  the visions, half mortal, half angelic, that people his fancy? Love,  who is painted blind (an allegory that proves the uselessness of  beauty), can supply all deficiencies with his aid; we can invest her  whom we admire with all the attributes of loveliness, and though time  may steal the roses from her cheek, and the lustre from her eye, still  the original _beau ideal_ remains, filling the mind and intoxicating  the soul with the overpowering presence of loveliness. I flatter  myself that my Leila, Zuleika, Gulnare, Medora, and Haidee will always  vouch for my taste in beauty: these are the bright creations of my  fancy, with rounded forms, and delicacy of limbs, nearly so  incompatible as to be rarely if ever united; for where, with some rare  exceptions, do we see roundness of contour accompanied by lightness,  and those fairy hands and feet that are at once the type of beauty and  refinement. I like to shut myself up, close my eyes, and fancy one of  the creatures of my imagination, with taper and rose-tipped fingers,  playing with my hair, touching my cheek, or resting its little  snowy-dimpled hand on mine. I like to fancy the fairy foot, round and  pulpy, but small to diminutiveness, peeping from beneath the drapery  that half conceals it, or moving in the mazes of the dance. I detest  thin women; and unfortunately all, or nearly all plump women, have  clumsy hands and feet, so that I am obliged to have recourse to  imagination for my beauties, and there I always find them. I can so  well understand the lover leaving his mistress that he might write to  her, I should leave mine, not to write to, but to think of her, to  dress her up in the habiliments of my ideal beauty, investing her with  all the charms of the latter, and then adoring the idol I had formed.  You must have observed that I give my heroines extreme refinement,  joined to great simplicity and want of education. Now, refinement and  want of education are incompatible, at least I have ever found them  so: so here again, you see, I am forced to have recourse to  imagination, and certainly it furnishes me with creatures as unlike  the sophisticated beings of civilized existence, as they are to the  still less tempting, coarse realities of vulgar life. In short, I am  of opinion that poets do not require great beauty in the objects of  their affection; all that is necessary for them is a strong and  devoted attachment from the object, and where this exists, joined to  health and good temper, little more is required, at least in early  youth, though with advancing years, men become more _exigeants_.\"  Talking of the difference between love in early youth and in maturity,  Byron said, \"that, like the measles, love was most dangerous when it  came late in life.\"    _New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      UMBRELLAS.    _By one of the year 1750._      Umbrellas, in my youth, were not ordinary things; few but the  macaronis of the day, as the dandies were then called, would venture  to display them. For a long while it was not usual for men to carry  them without incurring the brand of effeminacy, and they were vulgarly  considered as the characteristics of a person whom the mob hugely  disliked, namely, a mincing Frenchman! At first, a single umbrella  seems to have been kept at a coffee-house for some extraordinary  occasion--lent as a coach or chair in a heavy shower--but not commonly  carried by the walkers. The Female Tatler advertises, \"the young  gentleman belonging to the custom-house who, in fear of rain, borrowed  _the umbrella from Wilks' Coffee-House_, shall the next time be  welcome to the maid's _pattens_.\" An umbrella carried by a man was  obviously then considered as extreme effeminacy. As late as in 1778,  one John Macdonald, a footman, who has written his own life, informs  us that when he used \"a fine silk umbrella, which he had brought from  Spain, he could not with any comfort to himself use it; the people  calling out 'Frenchman! why don't you get a coach?'\" The fact was that  the hackney-coachmen and the chairmen, joining with the true _esprit  de corps_, were clamorous against this portentous rival. This footman,  in 1778, gives us further information. \"At this time there were no  umbrellas wore in London, except in noblemen's and gentlemen's houses,  where there was a large one hung in the hall to hold over a"]]]
