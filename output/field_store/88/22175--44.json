What are the  characters of the words, what of the facts themselves? and what, again,  is that prodigious greatness which can give rise to impressions of so  many things? What, lastly, is that power which investigates secret  things, and is called invention and contrivance? Does that man seem to  be compounded of this earthly, mortal, and perishing nature who first  invented names for everything; which, if you will believe Pythagoras,  is the highest pitch of wisdom? or he who collected the dispersed  inhabitants of the world, and united them in the bonds of social life?  or he who confined the sounds of the voice, which used to seem  infinite, to the marks of a few letters? or he who first observed the  courses of the planets, their progressive motions, their laws? These  were all great men. But they were greater still who invented food, and  raiment, and houses; who introduced civilization among us, and armed us  against the wild beasts; by whom we were made sociable and polished,  and so proceeded from the necessaries of life to its embellishments.  For we have provided great entertainments for the ears by inventing and  modulating the variety and nature of sounds; we have learned to survey  the stars, not only those that are fixed, but also those which are  improperly called wandering; and the man who has acquainted himself  with all their revolutions and motions is fairly considered to have a  soul resembling the soul of that Being who has created those stars in  the heavens: for when Archimedes described in a sphere the motions of  the moon, sun, and five planets, he did the very same thing as Plato's  God, in his Timaeus, who made the world, causing one revolution to  adjust motions differing as much as possible in their slowness and  velocity. Now, allowing that what we see in the world could not be  effected without a God, Archimedes could not have imitated the same  motions in his sphere without a divine soul.    XXVI. To me, indeed, it appears that even those studies which are more  common and in greater esteem are not without some divine energy: so  that I do not consider that a poet can produce a serious and sublime  poem without some divine impulse working on his mind; nor do I think  that eloquence, abounding with sonorous words and fruitful sentences,  can flow thus without something beyond mere human power. But as to  philosophy, that is the parent of all the arts: what can we call that  but, as Plato says, a gift, or, as I express it, an invention, of the  Gods? This it was which first taught us the worship of the Gods; and  then led us on to justice, which arises from the human race being  formed into society; and after that it imbued us with modesty and  elevation of soul. This it was which dispersed darkness from our souls,  as it is dispelled from our eyes, enabling us to see all things that  are above or below, the beginning, end, and middle of everything. I am  convinced entirely that that which could effect so many and such great  things must be a divine power. For what is memory of words and  circumstances? What, too, is invention? Surely they are things than  which nothing greater can be conceived in a God! For I do not imagine  the Gods to be delighted with nectar and ambrosia, or with Juventas  presenting them with a cup; nor do I put any faith in Homer, who says  that Ganymede was carried away by the Gods on account of his beauty, in  order to give Jupiter his wine. Too weak reasons for doing Laomedon  such injury! These were mere inventions of Homer, who gave his Gods the  imperfections of men. I would rather that he had given men the  perfections of the Gods! those perfections, I mean, of uninterrupted  health, wisdom, invention, memory. Therefore the soul (which is, as I  say, divine) is, as Euripides more boldly expresses it, a God. And  thus, if the divinity be air or fire, the soul of man is the same; for  as that celestial nature has nothing earthly or humid about it, in like  manner the soul of man is also free from both these qualities: but if  it is of that fifth kind of nature, first introduced by Aristotle, then  both Gods and souls are of the same.    XXVII. As this is my opinion, I have explained it in these very words,  in my book on Consolation.[19] The origin of the soul of man is not to  be found upon earth, for there is nothing in the soul of a mixed or  concrete nature, or that has any appearance of being formed or made out  of the earth; nothing even humid, or airy, or fiery. For what is there  in natures of that kind which has the power of memory, understanding,  or thought? which can recollect the past, foresee the future, and  comprehend the present? for these capabilities are confined to divine  beings; nor can we discover any source from which men could derive  them, but from God. There is therefore a peculiar nature and power in  the soul, distinct from those natures which are more known and familiar  to us. Whatever, then, that is which thinks, and which has  understanding, and volition, and a principle of life, is heavenly and  divine, and on that account must necessarily be eternal; nor can God  himself, who is known to us, be conceived to be anything else except a  soul free and unembarrassed, distinct from all mortal concretion,  acquainted with everything, and giving motion to everything, and itself  endued with perpetual motion.    XXVIII. Of this kind and nature is the intellect of man. Where, then,  is this intellect seated, and of what character is it? where is your  own, and what is its character? Are you able to tell? If I have not  faculties for knowing all that I could desire to know, will you not  even allow me to make use of those which I have? The soul has not  sufficient capacity to comprehend itself; yet, the soul, like the eye,  though it has no distinct view of itself, sees other things: it does  not see (which is of least consequence) its own shape; perhaps not,  though it possibly may; but we will pass that by: but it certainly sees  that it has vigor, sagacity, memory, motion, and velocity; these are  all great, divine, eternal properties. What its appearance is, or where  it dwells, it is not necessary even to inquire. As when we behold,  first of all, the beauty and brilliant appearance of the heavens;  secondly, the vast velocity of its revolutions, beyond power of our  imagination to conceive; then the vicissitudes of nights and days, the  fourfold division of the seasons, so well adapted to the ripening of  the fruits of the earth, and the temperature of our bodies: and after  that we look up to the sun, the moderator and governor of all these  things; and view the moon, by the increase and decrease of its light,  marking, as it were, and appointing our holy days; and see the five  planets, borne on in the same circle, divided into twelve parts,  preserving the same course with the greatest regularity, but with  utterly dissimilar motions among themselves; and the nightly appearance  of the heaven, adorned on all sides with stars; then, the globe of the  earth, raised above the sea, and placed in the centre of the universe,  inhabited and cultivated in its two opposite extremities, one of which,  the place of our habitation, is situated towards the north pole, under  the seven stars:        Where the cold northern blasts, with horrid sound,      Harden to ice the snowy cover'd ground;    the other, towards the south pole, is unknown to us, but is called by  the Greeks [Greek: antichthona]: the other parts are uncultivated,  because they are either frozen with cold, or burned up with heat; but  where we dwell, it never fails, in its season,        To yield a placid sky, to bid the trees      Assume the lively verdure of their leaves:      The vine to bud, and, joyful, in its shoots,      Foretell the approaching vintage of its fruits:      The ripen'd corn to sing, while all around      Full riv'lets glide; and flowers deck the ground:    then the multitude of cattle, fit part for food, part for tilling the  ground, others for carrying us, or for clothing us; and man himself,  made, as it were, on purpose to contemplate the heavens and the Gods,  and to pay adoration to them: lastly, the whole earth, and wide  extending seas, given to man's use. When we view these and numberless  other things, can we doubt that they have some being who presides over  them, or has made them (if, indeed, they have been made, as is the  opinion of Plato, or if, as Aristotle thinks, they are eternal), or who  at all events is the regulator of so immense a fabric and so great a  blessing to men? Thus, though you see not the soul of man, as you see  not the Deity, yet, as by the contemplation of his works you are led to  acknowledge a God, so you must own the divine power of the soul, from  its remembering things, from its invention, from the quickness of its  motion, and from all the beauty of virtue. Where, then, is it seated,  you will say?    XXIX. In my opinion, it is seated in the head, and I can bring you  reasons for my adopting that opinion. At present, let the soul reside  where it will, you certainly have one in you. Should you ask what its  nature is? It has one peculiarly its own; but admitting it to consist  of fire, or air, it does not affect the present question. Only observe  this, that as you are convinced there is a God, though you are ignorant  where he resides, and what shape he is of; in like manner you ought to  feel assured that you have a soul, though you cannot satisfy yourself  of the place of its residence, nor its form. In our knowledge of the  soul, unless we are grossly ignorant of natural philosophy, we cannot  but be satisfied that it has nothing but what is simple, unmixed,  uncompounded, and single; and if this is admitted, then it cannot be  separated, nor divided, nor dispersed, nor parted, and therefore it  cannot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#7)"],[1,"of manipulation. It is, of course, different  with the valve trumpet. The natural trumpets are not limited to one or  two keys, but those in F, E, E flat, D, B flat, and even A have been  employed; but, usually, the valve trumpets are in F, and the higher B  flat, with a growing inclination, but an unfortunate one, to be  restricted to the latter, it being easier for cornet players. The tone  of the high B flat trumpet cannot, however, compare with the F one,  and with it the lowest notes are lost. Of course, when there are two  or three trumpets, the high B flat one finds a place. However, the  valve system applied to the trumpet is not regarded with satisfaction,  as it makes the tone dull. For grand heroic effect, valve trumpets  cannot replace the natural trumpets with slides, which are now only to  be heard in this country.    The simple or field trumpet appears to exist now in one representative  only, the E flat cavalry trumpet. Bach wrote for trumpets up to the  twentieth harmonic--but for this the trumpet had to be divided into a  principal, which ended at the tenth harmonic--and the clarino in two  divisions, the first of which went from the eighth harmonic up to as  high as the player could reach, and the second clarino, from the sixth  to the twelfth. The use of the clarinet by composers about the middle  of the last century seems to have abolished these very high trumpets.  So completely had they gone, by the time of Mozart, that he had to  change Handel's trumpet parts, to accommodate them to performers of  his own time, and transfer the high notes to the oboes and clarinets.    Having alluded to the cornet a piston, it may be introduced here,  particularly as from being between a trumpet and a bugle, and of four  foot tone, it is often made to do duty for the more noble trumpet. But  the distinctive feature of this, as of nearly all brass instruments  since the invention of valves, tends to a compromise instrument, which  owes its origin to the bugle. The cornet a piston is now not very  different from the valve bugle in B flat on the one hand and from the  small valve trumpet in the same key on the other. It is a hybrid  between this high pitch trumpet and the bugle, but compared with the  latter it has a much smaller bell. By the use of valves and pistons,  with which it was the first to be endowed, the cornet can easily  execute passages of consecutive notes that in the natural trumpet can  only be got an octave higher. It is a facile instrument, and double  tonguing, which is also possible with the horn and trumpet, is one of  its popular means for display. It has a harmonic compass from middle C  to C above the treble clef, and can go higher, but with difficulty. A  few lower notes, however, are easily taken with the valves.    We now come to the trombones, grand, sonorous tubes, which, existing  in three or four sizes since the sixteenth century, are among the most  potent additions on occasion to the full orchestra. Their treble can  be regarded as the English slide trumpet, but it is not exactly so.  There appears to have been as late as Bach a soprano trombone, and it  is figured by Virdung, A.D. 1511, as no larger than the field trumpet.  The trumpet is not on so large a caliber, and in the seventeenth  century had its own family of two clarinos and three tubas. The old  English name of the trombone is sackbut. The old wooden cornet, or  German zinke, an obsolete, cupped mouthpiece instrument, the real bass  of which, according to family, is the now obsolete serpent, was used  in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as the treble instrument in  combination with alto, tenor, and bass trombones. The leading features  of the trumpet are also found, as already inferred, in the trombone;  there is the cupped mouthpiece, the cylindrical tubing, and, finally,  a gradual increase in diameter to the bell. The slide used for the  trumpet appears for four centuries, and probably longer, in the well  known construction of the trombone. In this instrument it consists of  two cylindrical tubes parallel with each other, upon which two other  tubes communicating by a pipe at their lower ends curved in a half  circle glide without loss of air. The mouthpiece is fitted to an upper  end, and a bell to a lower end of the slide. When the slide is closed,  the instrument is at its highest pitch, and as the column of air is  lengthened by drawing the slide out, the pitch is lowered. By this  contrivance a complete chromatic scale can be obtained, and as the  determination of the notes it produces is by ear, we have in it the  only wind instrument that can compare in accuracy with stringed  instruments. The player holds a cross bar between the two lengths of  the instrument, which enables him to lengthen or shorten the slide at  pleasure, and in the bass trombone, as the stretch would be too great  for the length of a man's arm, a jointed handle is attached to the  cross bar. The player has seven positions, each a semitone apart for  elongation, and each note has its own system of harmonics, but in  practice he only occasionally goes beyond the fifth. The present  trombones are the alto in E flat descending to A in the seventh  position; the tenor in B flat descending to E; the bass in F  descending to B, and a higher bass in G descending to C sharp. Wagner,  who has made several important innovations in writing for bass brass  instruments, requires an octave bass trombone in B flat; an octave  lower than the tenor one, in the \"Nibelungen.\" The fundamental tones  of the trombone are called \"pedal\" notes. They are difficult to get  and less valuable than harmonics because, in all wind instruments,  notes produced by overblowing are richer than the fundamental notes in  tone quality. Valve trombones do not, however, find favor, the defects  of intonation being more prominent than in shorter instruments. But  playing with wide bore tubas and their kindred is not advantageous to  this noble instrument.    The serpent has been already mentioned as the bass of the obsolete  zinken or wooden cornets, straight or curved, with cupped mouthpiece.  It gained its serpentine form from the facility given thereby to the  player to cover the six holes with his fingers. In course of time keys  were added to it, and when changed into a bassoon shape its name  changed to the Russian bass horn or basson Russe. A Parisian  instrument maker, Halary, in 1817, made this a complete instrument,  after the manner of the keyed bugle of Halliday, and producing it in  brass called it the ophicleide, from two Greek words meaning serpent  and keys--keyed serpent--although it was more like a keyed bass bugle.  The wooden serpent has gone out of use in military bands within  recollection, the ophicleide from orchestras only recently. It has  been superseded by the development of the valved tubas. The euphonium  and bombardon, the basses of the important family of saxhorns, now  completely cover the ground of bass wind instrument music. The keyed  bugle, invented by Joseph Halliday, bandmaster of the Cavan militia,  in 1810, may be regarded as the prototype of all these instruments,  excepting that the keys have been entirely replaced by the valve  system, an almost contemporary invention by Stoelzel and Blumel, in  Prussia, in 1815. The valve instruments began to prevail as early as  1850. The sound tube of all bugles, saxhorns, and tubas is conical,  with a much wider curve than the horn. The quality of tone produced is  a general kind of tone, not possessing the individuality of any of the  older instruments. All these valve instruments may be comprehended  under the French name of saxhorn. There is a division between them of  the higher instruments or bugles, which do not sound the fundamental  note, and of the lower, or tubas, which sound it readily. Properly  military band instruments, the second or bass division, has been taken  over to the orchestra; and Wagner has made great use of it in his  great scores. The soprano cornets, bugles, or flugelhorns and saxhorns  are in E flat; the corresponding alto instruments in B flat, which is  also the pitch of the ordinary cornet. The tenor, baryton, and bass  instruments follow in similar relation; the bass horns are, as I have  said, called tubas; and that with four valves, the euphonium. The  bombardon, or E flat tuba, has much richer lower notes.    For military purposes, this and the contrabass--the helicon--are  circular. Finally, the contrabass tubas in B flat, and in C, for  Wagner, have immense depth and potentiality of tone; all these  instruments are capable of pianissimo.    There are many varieties now of these brass instruments, nearer  particulars of which may be found in Gevaert, and other eminent  musicians' works on instrumentation. One fact I will not pass by,  which is that, from the use of brass instruments (which rise in pitch  so rapidly under increase of temperature, as Mr. Blaikley has shown,  almost to the coefficient of the sharpening under heat in organ pipes)  has come about that rise in pitch which, from 1816 to 1846--until  repressed by the authority of the late Sir Michael Costa, and, more  recently, by the action of the Royal Military College at Kneller  Hall--is an extraordinary feature in musical history. All previous  variations in pitch--and they have comprised as much as a fourth in  the extremes--having been due either to transposition, owing to the  requirements of the human voice, or to national or provincial  measurements. The manufacture of brass instruments is a distinct  craft, although some of the processes are similar to those used by  silversmiths, coppersmiths, and braziers.    I have only time to add a few words about the percussion instruments  which the military band permits to connect with the wind. Drums are,  with the exception of kettle drums, indeterminate instruments, hardly,  in themselves, to be regarded as musical, and yet "]]]
