[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13482"],[0,"What the Schools Teach and Might Teach (#7)"],[1,"true character of the work is really indicated by the last  sentence of the eighth-grade history assignment: \"The text of our book  should be thoroughly mastered.\"    In discussing the situation, the first thing to which we must call  attention is the great value of history for an understanding of the  multitude of complicated social problems met with by all people in a  democracy. In a country where all people are the rulers, all need a  good understanding of the social, political, economic, industrial, and  other problems with which we are continually confronted. It is true  the thing needed is an understanding of present conditions, but there  is no better key to a right understanding of our present conditions  than history furnishes. One comes to understand a present situation by  observing how it has come to be. History is one of the most important  methods of social analysis.    The history should be so taught that it will have a demonstrably  practical purpose. In drawing up courses of study in the subject for  the grammar grades and the high school, the first task should be an  analysis of present-day social conditions, the proper understanding of  which requires historical background. Once having discovered the list  of social topics, it is possible to find historical readings which  will show how present conditions have grown up out of earlier ones.  Looked at from a practical point of view, the history should be  developed on the basis of topics, a great abundance of reading being  provided for each of the topics. We have in mind such topics as the  following:      Sociological Aspects of War    Territorial Expansion    Race Problems    Tariff and Free Trade    Transportation    Money Systems    Our Insular Possessions    Growth of Population    Trusts    Banks and Banking    Immigration    Capital and Labor    Education    Inventions    Suffrage    Centralization of Government    Strikes and Lockouts    Panics and Business Depressions    Commerce    Taxation    Manufacturing    Labor Unions    Foreign Commerce    Agriculture    Postal Service    Army    Government Control of Corporations    Municipal Government    Navy    Factory Labor    Wages    Courts of Law    Charities    Crime    Fire Protection    Roads and Road Transportation    Newspapers and Magazines    National Defense    Conservation of Natural Resources    Liquor Problems    Parks and Playgrounds    Housing Conditions    Mining    Health, Sanitation, etc.    Pensions    Unemployment    Child Labor    Women in Industry    Cost of Living    Pure Food Control    Savings Banks    Water Supply of Cities    Prisons    Recreations and Amusements    Co-operative Buying and Selling    Insurance    Hospitals    After drawing up such lists of topics for study, they should be  assigned to grammar grades and high school according to the degree  of maturity necessary for their comprehension. Naturally as much as  possible should be covered in the grammar grades. Such as cannot be  covered there should be covered as early as practicable in the high  school, since so large a number of students drop out, and all need  the work. Of course, this would involve a radical revision of the high  school courses in history. It is not here recommended that any such  changes be attempted abruptly. There are too many other conditions  that require readjustment at the same time. It must all be a gradual  growth.    Naturally, students must have some familiarity with the general  time relations of history and the general chronological movements  of affairs before they can understand the more or less specialized  treatment of individual topics. Preliminary studies are therefore both  necessary and desirable in the intermediate and grammar grades for the  purpose of giving the general background. During these grades a great  wealth of historical materials should be stored up. Pupils should  acquire much familiarity with the history of the ancient oriental  nations, Judea, Greece, Rome, the states of modern Europe and America.  The purpose should be to give a general, and in the beginning a  relatively superficial, overview of the world's history for the  sake of perspective. The reading should be biographical, anecdotal,  thrilling dramas of human achievement, rich with human interest.  It should be at every stage of the work on the level with the  understanding and degree of maturity of the pupils, so that much  reading can be covered rapidly. Given the proper conditions--chiefly  an abundance of the proper books supplied in sets large enough for  classes--pupils can cover a large amount of ground, obtain a wealth  of historical experience, and acquire a great quantity of useful  information, the main outlines of which are remembered without much  difficulty. They can in this manner lay a broad historical foundation  for the study of the social topics that should begin by the seventh  grade and continue throughout the high school.    The textbooks of the present type can be employed as a part of this  preliminary training. Read in their entirety and read rapidly, they  give one that perspective which comes from a comprehensive view of the  entire field. But they are too brief, abstract, and barren to afford  valuable concrete historical experience. They are excellent reference  books for gaining and keeping historical perspective.    Reading of the character that we have here called preliminary should  not cease as the other historical studies are taken up. The general  studies should certainly continue for some portion of the time through  the grammar grades and high school, but it probably should be mainly  supervised reading of interesting materials rather than recitation and  examination work.    We would recommend that the high schools give careful attention to the  recommendation of the National Education Association Committee on the  Reorganization of the Secondary Course of Study in History.          CIVICS      Civic training scarcely finds a place upon the elementary school  program. The manual suggests that one-quarter of the history time--10  to 20 minutes per week--in the fifth and sixth grades should be given  to a discussion of such civic topics as the department of public  service, street cleaning, garbage disposal, health and sanitation, the  city water supply, the mayor and the council, the treasurer, and the  auditor. The topics are important, but the time allowed is inadequate  and the pupils of these grades are so immature that no final treatment  of such complicated matters is possible. For seventh and eighth  grades, the manual makes no reference to civics. This is the more  surprising because Cleveland is a city in which there has been no  end of civic discussion and progressive human-welfare effort. The  extraordinary value of civic education in the elementary school, as a  means of furthering civic welfare, should have received more decided  recognition.    The elementary teachers and principals of Cleveland might profitably  make such a civic survey as that made in Cincinnati as the method of  discovering the topics that should enter into a grammar grade course.  The heavy emphasis upon this subject should be reserved for the later  grades of the elementary school.    In the high schools, a little is being accomplished. In the academic  high schools, those who take the classical course receive no civics  whatever. It is not even elective for them. Those who take the  scientific or English courses may take civics as a half-year elective.  In the technical high schools it is required of all for a half-year.  The course is offered only in the senior year, except in the High  School of Commerce, where it is offered in the third. As a result of  these various circumstances, the majority of students who enter and  complete the course in the high schools of Cleveland receive no civic  training whatever--not even the inadequate half-year of work that is  available for a few.    Whether the deficiencies here pointed out are serious or not depends  in large measure upon the character of the other social subjects, such  as history and geography. If these are developed in full and concrete  ways, they illumine large numbers of our difficult social problems.  It is probable that the larger part of the informational portions of  civic training should be imparted through these other social subjects.  Whether very much of this is actually done at present is doubtful;  for the history teaching, as has already been noted, is much  underdeveloped, and while somewhat further advanced, geography work is  still far from adequate at the time this report is written.          GEOGRAPHY      Geography in Cleveland is given the customary amount of time, though  it is distributed over the grades in a somewhat unusual way. It is  exceptionally heavy in the intermediate grades and correspondingly  light in the grammar grades. As geography, like all other subjects,  is more and more humanized and socialized in its reference, much more  time will be called for in the last two grammar grades.

Now shalt thou tell King Sigmund, that I deem it the crown of my life    To dwell in the house of his fathers amidst all peace and strife.\"           *       *       *       *       *      Now the king's heart sore misgave him, but herewith must he be content,    And great gifts to the earl of Lyngi and a word withal he sent,    That the woman's troth was plighted to another people's king.    But King Sigmund's earl on the morrow hath joyful yea-saying,    And ere two moons be perished he shall fetch his bride away.    \"And bid him,\" King Eylimi sayeth, \"to come with no small array,    But with sword and shield and war-shaft, lest aught of ill betide.\"      So forth goes the earl of Sigmund across the sea-flood wide,    And comes to the land of the Volsungs, and meeteth Sigmund the king,    And tells how he sped on his errand, and the joyful yea-saying.    So King Sigmund maketh him ready, and they ride adown to the sea    All glorious of gear and raiment, and a goodly company.    Yet hath Sigmund thought of his father, and the deed he wrought before,    And hath scorn to gather his people and all his hosts of war    To wend to the feast and the wedding: yet are their long-ships ten,    And the shielded folk aboard them are the mightiest men of men.    So Sigmund goeth a shipboard, and they hoist their sails to the wind,    And the beaks of the golden dragons leave the Volsungs' land behind.    Then come they to Eylimi's kingdom, and good welcome have they there,    And when Sigmund looked on Hiordis, he deemed her wise and fair.    But her heart was exceeding fain when she saw the glorious king,    And it told her of times that should be full many a noble thing.      So there is Sigmund wedded at a great and goodly feast,    And day by day on Hiordis the joy of her heart increased;    And her father joyed in Sigmund and his might and majesty,    And dead in the heart of the Isle-king his ancient fear did lie.      Yet, forsooth, had men looked seaward, they had seen the gathering cloud,    And the little wind arising, that should one day pipe so loud.    For well may ye wot indeed that King Lyngi the Mighty is wroth,    When he getteth the gifts and the answer, and that tale of the woman's         troth:    And he saith he will have the gifts and the woman herself withal,    Either for loving or hating, and that both those heads shall fall.    So now when Sigmund and Hiordis are wedded a month or more,    And the Volsung bids men dight them to cross the sea-flood o'er,    Lo, how there cometh the tidings of measureless mighty hosts    Who are gotten ashore from their long-ships on the skirts of King Eylimi's         coasts.      Sore boded the heart of the Isle-king of what the end should be.    But Sigmund long beheld him, and he said: \"Thou deem'st of me    That my coming hath brought thee evil; but put aside such things;    For long have I lived, and I know it, that the lives of mighty kings    Are not cast away, nor drifted like the down before the wind;    And surely I know, who say it, that never would Hiordis' mind    Have been turned to wed King Lyngi or aught but the Volsung seed.    Come, go we forth to the battle, that shall be the latest deed    Of thee and me meseemeth: yea, whether thou live or die,    No more shall the brand of Odin at peace in his scabbard lie.\"      And therewith he brake the peace-strings and drew the blade of bale,    And Death on the point abided, Fear sat on the edges pale.      So men ride adown to the sea-strand, and the kings their hosts array    When the high noon flooded heaven; and the men of the Volsungs lay,    With King Eylimi's shielded champions mid Lyngi's hosts of war,    As the brown pips lie in the apple when ye cut it through the core.      But now when the kings were departed, from the King's house Hiordis went,    And before men joined the battle she came to a woody bent,    Where she lay with one of her maidens the death and the deeds to behold.      In the noon sun shone King Sigmund as an image all of gold,    And he stood before the foremost and the banner of his fame,    And many a thing he remembered, and he called on each earl by his name    To do well for the house of the Volsungs, and the ages yet unborn.    Then he tossed up the sword of the Branstock, and blew on his father's horn,    Dread of so many a battle, doom-song of so many a man.    Then all the earth seemed moving as the hosts of Lyngi ran    On the Volsung men and the Isle-folk like wolves upon the prey;    But sore was their labour and toil ere the end of their harvesting day.      On went the Volsung banners, and on went Sigmund before,    And his sword was the flail of the tiller on the wheat of the         wheat-thrashing floor,    And his shield was rent from his arm, and his helm was sheared from his         head:    But who may draw nigh him to smite for the heap and the rampart of dead?    White went his hair on the wind like the ragged drift of the cloud,    And his dust-driven, blood-beaten harness was the death-storm's angry         shroud,    When the summer sun is departing in the first of the night of wrack;    And his sword was the cleaving lightning, that smites and is hurried aback    Ere the hand may rise against it; and his voice was the following thunder.      Then cold grew the battle before him, dead-chilled with the fear and the         wonder:    For again in his ancient eyes the light of victory gleamed;    From his mouth grown tuneful and sweet the song of his kindred streamed;    And no more was he worn and weary, and no more his life seemed spent:    And with all the hope of his childhood was his wrath of battle blent;    And he thought: A little further, and the river of strife is passed,    And I shall sit triumphant the king of the world at last.      But lo, through the hedge of the war-shafts a mighty man there came,    One-eyed and seeming ancient, but his visage shone like flame:    Gleaming-grey was his kirtle, and his hood was cloudy blue;    And he bore a mighty twi-bill, as he waded the fight-sheaves through,    And stood face to face with Sigmund, and upheaved the bill to smite.    Once more round the head of the Volsung fierce glittered the Branstock's         light,    The sword that came from Odin; and Sigmund's cry once more    Rang out to the very heavens above the din of war.    Then clashed the meeting edges with Sigmund's latest stroke,    And in shivering shards fell earthward that fear of worldly folk.    But changed were the eyes of Sigmund, and the war-wrath left his face;    For that grey-clad mighty helper was gone, and in his place    Drave on the unbroken spear-wood 'gainst the Volsung's empty hands:    And there they smote down Sigmund, the wonder of all lands,    On the foemen, on the death-heap his deeds had piled that day.      Ill hour for Sigmund's fellows! they fall like the seeded hay    Before the brown scythes' sweeping, and there the Isle-king fell    In the fore-front of his battle, wherein he wrought right well,    And soon they were nought but foemen who stand upon their feet    On the isle-strand by the ocean where the grass and the sea-sand meet.      And now hath the conquering War-king another deed to do,    And he saith: \"Who now gainsayeth King Lyngi come to woo,    The lord and the overcomer and the bane of the Volsung kin?\"    So he fares to the Isle-king's dwelling a wife of the kings to win;    And the host is gathered together, and they leave the field of the dead;    And round as a targe of the Goth-folk the moon ariseth red.      And so when the last is departed, and she deems they will come not aback,    Fares Hiordis forth from the thicket to the field of the fateful wrack,    And half-dead was her heart for sorrow as she waded the swathes of the         sword.    Not far did she search the death-field ere she found her king and lord    On the heap that his glaive had fashioned: not yet was his spirit past,    Though his hurts were many and grievous, and his life-blood ebbing fast;    And glad were his eyes and open as her wan face over him hung,    And he spake:                 \"Thou art sick with sorrow, and I would thou wert not so young;    Yet as my days passed shall thine pass; and a short while now it seems    Since my hand first gripped the sword-hilt, and my glory was but in dreams.\"      She said: \"Thou livest, thou livest! the leeches shall heal thee still.\"      \"Nay,\" said he, \"my heart hath hearkened to Odin's bidding and will;    For today have mine eyes beheld him: nay, he needed not to speak:    Forsooth I knew of his message and the thing he came to seek.    And now do I live but to tell thee of the days that are yet to come:    And perchance to solace thy sorrow; and then will I get me home    To my kin that are gone before me. Lo, yonder where I stood    The shards of a glaive of battle that was once the best of the good:    Take them and keep them surely. I have lived no empty days;    The Norns were my nursing mothers; I have won the people's praise.    When the Gods for one deed asked me I ever gave them twain;    Spendthrift of glory I was,"]]]
