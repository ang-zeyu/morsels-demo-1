[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#7)"],[1,"1891 and 1897 and  the workmen were recruited from Senegal and the British Colonies of  Africa. Frequent stops are necessary for the engines to drink and gain  their second winds, for their work here is very arduous. After two or  three hours, however, a plateau is reached and the line runs for miles  through dense forests of palms, acacias and _parasol_ trees (native  Motumbi). The name exactly describes these trees, for the branches are  arranged like the ribs, and the leaves spread out and form the covering  of the sunshade.    Between the belts of forests the country is covered with coarse grass,  six or seven feet high, dotted here and there with palms. No vestige of  animal life is visible and only a few natives who are engaged on the  railway. These inhabit villages near at hand, formed of huts built of  reeds or bamboo and thatched with grass. The men wear a loin cloth only,  but the women are wrapped in a plain piece of richly coloured cloth  which reaches from the neck to the ankle leaving the arms and feet bare.  This is evidently a simple length of stuff some three or four feet wide  and, to the masculine eye at least, its method of support remains a  mystery, for no trace of button, hook or pin is apparent. Their faces  are of the negroid type with broad noses and thick lips and the figures  of the women approach the shape of an S reversed thus [backwards S] and  are similar to those which our American cousins have so largely  developed. The men are as a rule thin and tall with very long legs and  all appear to have only small arches to their feet. On the lower Congo  however, there are many foreigners and several other types are visible.  As far as one can judge by the railway cuttings, the soil on the plateau  is coarse sand and gravel containing iron and quite unsuitable for  agricultural purposes under such a hot sun. The air however, as we  approach Tumba, about 2000 feet above sea level, is dry and fresh and at  4 p.m. we halt there for the night.    We are met by Commandant Delhaz, the Commissaire of the Cataracts  District, who kindly places a bungalow at our disposal for the night and  shows us round the settlement. There is only a small native village  here, but large barracks consisting of lines of clean, clay huts  constructed by the soldiers. Tumba is indeed an important military  centre and here again the appearance of the troops is very fine as they  march to the strains of the band which renders snatches from _Faust_,  _Carmen_ and other well known airs with a few native variations. A farm  has been established in the neighbourhood to feed the garrison and an  automobile road is in course of construction.    Next morning, we dress by candle light and make a hasty breakfast, in  the midst of which, at 6 a.m., reveille sounds and the troops assemble  in the square in front of the Residency. Half an hour afterwards, the  train starts, and having perched ourselves on the summits of the seats,  we soon reach Sonna Gongo the half-way house for travellers of the  future. Here is a depot for locomotives and carriages and wooden hotels  are being constructed to accommodate travellers who, after August, will  stop here for the night instead of at Tumba.    Leaving Sonna Gongo, the line rapidly searches for a lower level and the  view is magnificent, as a great endless expanse of land is unfolded.  Here and there are banks of smoke caused by the veldt fires and often  close to the railway the high dry grass has been lighted by a chance  spark from an engine, and is burning furiously. We now zigzag down hill  instead of up and far beneath, can be seen the thin line of rails  glistening in the sun like fillets of silk. Having reached this level,  we plunge through inviting looking forests at one time full of  elephants, buffaloes and other game, but practically deserted now save  by monkeys and parrots.    Soon after the train stops at a station where the natives have assembled  to sell fruit and kwanga, a kind of bread made from the flour of the  manioc root and the chief article of native diet. It consists chiefly of  starch and is not unpleasant when fresh and toasted. The natives  however, prefer all food in a high stage of decomposition and it is some  time before the very smell of it ceases to make one feel ill. To see  them eating kwanga fish or the flesh of elephants, monkeys, antelopes or  other animals generally both rotten and raw is most disgusting and  brings home the fact sharply that man here is of a very low type.    The oranges the natives sell are very acid, more resembling grape-fruit  than the orange of Florida, but the bananas are as good as any in the  world and the pine apples--three of which can be bought for half a  franc--are equal to the finest hot-house variety.    [Illustration: THE STEAMER _FLANDRE_.]    The line now descends again until it reaches a flat hot, sandy and  uninteresting plain across which it runs absolutely straight for seven  miles until it reaches Kinshasa on the South bank of Stanley Pool. A few  miles further on, is the rail head, Leopoldville. Like everything else  in the Congo, this town has been arranged and built for practical use.  The railway runs along the beach so as to facilitate the loading and  unloading of the steamers of the upper river, and in a very short time  all our baggage is taken from the train and carried straight on board  the _Flandre_ where we find cabins booked for us. This is an excellent  arrangement and saves much trouble, for although the steamer does not  sail for two days, passengers are allowed to live on board while in  port. Indeed it is very necessary, for there are no hotels in the town,  and no accommodation for visitors except a few rooms in the commercial  houses.    Some traits of the native's character were now to be demonstrated to us.  His main idea always is, to do as little work as possible and he will  often take the greatest trouble in his effort to accomplish this object.  Each native endeavoured to put his load as near the gangway as possible  which was soon blocked and then he had to come back, hoist the package  on his head again and carry it to its proper place. Although this  performance took place every day, unless an officer was constantly on  the watch, the foolish fellows in their attempts to shirk duty brought  upon themselves extra work. The cabins were unfurnished, for everyone  carries his own bed on the Congo, and most also their own tent. It was  therefore necessary to unpack a bed. Here was a difficulty. All the bags  and boxes were carefully numbered by the Army and Navy Stores and the  invoice no doubt sent to my London address but I left before it arrived,  and there was no possibility of discovering which number meant bed.  Seizing a likely looking bale, the boys unlace it, and find a part of a  tent, and a second attempt brings to light another part of a tent. It is  now growing dark and a light is necessary, but in which of these seventy  odd cases is the lamp? Not knowing the native mind, I explain that it is  necessary to hurry and find the bed before dark. This evidently conveys  no meaning at all to the boys, for in the first place it was not their  bed and so it mattered nothing to them, and in the second, they had  never hurried before in their lives, and could not do so now, even if  they wished. Lacing the first bales up slowly and deliberately, they  open another and find a canvas bath and washhandstand. These are at any  rate useful, and encouraged by success we try again and come across  hand-irons and starch. At length we find a thing like a large concertina  which is really a folding bed with pillows and blankets, complete. By  great good luck a mosquito curtain is then found and the steward kindly  lends a candle.    Hot, sticky, tired and cross we prepare for our first meal on a Congo  steamer. It consisted of a soup of mystery, chicken, which had been  washed in the river close to a group of natives bathing and a goat,  killed an hour before dinner, whose flesh was thrown quivering into the  pot. However, there was some bread and tinned peaches and it was no use  being fastidious in Central Africa. This was washed down with the  regulation half litre of red wine, a kind of claret which is quite  drinkable and some native coffee which had a delicate and fine aroma,  but was badly made.    The captain--as indeed are nearly all the officers of the river  steamers--was a Scandinavian and spoke English very well. He explained  that the ship was not very clean or inviting-looking, which was the  truth, but as the lower deck was lumbered up with the horses of  Commandant Sillye and was swarming with natives, it was only to be  expected.    Then to bed, but not to sleep, for the boys to save themselves trouble,  had not fixed the mosquito net properly. In my innocence I merely  ordered them to do it and had not stood by and watched. It is indeed  necessary always to see that the native does as he is told, for the  moment one's back is turned, he is eating if there is anything rotten  enough at hand to tempt him and if not, he quietly goes to sleep. Even  these State servants who speak the native language and also a kind of  French, really live the lives of animals, for they eat, drink, and sleep  if left alone and only work when they are shown how, and watched all the  time.    The result was that I spent a most horrible night, for the mosquitoes  were terribly hostile and evidently recognised a new European with some  healthy blood. In the morning, my head, which I had had shaved in the  Congo fashion, was covered with large bumps and face, neck, hands and  wrists were all blotches. It was therefore with little appetite that I  sat down to a breakfast of bread, dutch cheese, curious tinned butter  and weak coffee without milk. Little however, did I think then that in  six short months a Congo steamer would seem like a first class hotel, so  entirely is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#7)"],[1,"cakes, fruit, etc. The gates of Purgatory are opened,  and the hungry ghosts troop forth to enjoy themselves for a month on  the good things provided for them by the pious. The ninth day of the  ninth moon is the Chung Yang Festival, when every one who possibly  can ascends to a high place--a hill or temple-tower. This inaugurates  the kite-flying season, and is supposed to promote longevity. During  that season, which lasts several months, the Chinese people the sky  with dragons, centipedes, frogs, butterflies, and hundreds of other  cleverly devised creatures, which, by means of simple mechanisms worked  by the wind, roll their eyes, make appropriate sounds, and move their  paws, wings, tails, etc., in a most realistic manner. The festival  originated in a warning received by a scholar named Huan Ching from  his master Fei Ch'ang-fang, a native of Ju-nan in Honan, who lived  during the Han dynasty, that a terrible calamity was about to happen,  and enjoining him to escape with his family to a high place. On his  return he found all his domestic animals dead, and was told that  they had died instead of himself and his relatives. On New Year's Eve  (_Tuan Nien_ or _Chu Hsi_) the Kitchen-god ascends to Heaven to make  his annual report, the wise feasting him with honey and other sticky  food before his departure, so that his lips may be sealed and he be  unable to 'let on' too much to the powers that be in the regions above!      Sports and Games    The first sports of the Chinese were festival gatherings for purposes  of archery, to which succeeded exercises partaking of a military  character. Hunting was a favourite amusement. They played games of  calculation, chess (or the 'game of war'), shuttlecock with the feet,  pitch-pot (throwing arrows from a distance into a narrow-necked jar),  and 'horn-goring' (fighting on the shoulders of others with horned  masks on their heads). Stilts, football, dice-throwing, boat-racing,  dog-racing, cock-fighting, kite-flying, as well as singing and dancing  marionettes, afforded recreation and amusement.    Many of these games became obsolete in course of time, and new ones  were invented. At the end of the Monarchical Period, during the Manchu  dynasty, we find those most in use to be foot-shuttlecock, lifting of  beams headed with heavy stones--dumb-bells four feet long and weighing  thirty or forty pounds--kite-flying, quail-fighting, cricket-fighting,  sending birds after seeds thrown into the air, sauntering through  fields, playing chess or 'morra,' or gambling with cards, dice, or  over the cricket- and quail-fights or seed-catching birds. There were  numerous and varied children's games tending to develop strength,  skill, quickness of action, parental instinct, accuracy, and  sagacity. Theatricals were performed by strolling troupes on stages  erected opposite temples, though permanent theatres also existed,  female parts until recently being taken by male actors. Peep-shows,  conjurers, ventriloquists, acrobats, fortune-tellers, and story-tellers  kept crowds amused or interested. Generally, 'young China' of the  present day, identified with the party of progress, seems to have  adopted most of the outdoor but very few of the indoor games of  Western nations.      Domestic Life    In domestic or private life, observances at birth, betrothal, and  marriage were elaborate, and retained superstitious elements. Early  rising was general. Shaving of the head and beard, as well as cleaning  of the ears and massage, was done by barbers. There were public  baths in all cities and towns. Shops were closed at nightfall, and,  the streets being until recent times ill-lit or unlit, passengers or  their attendants carried lanterns. Most houses, except the poorest,  had private watchmen. Generally two meals a day were taken. Dinners to  friends were served at inns or restaurants, accompanied or followed  by musical or theatrical performances. The place of honour is stated  in Western books on China to be on the left, but the fact is that the  place of honour is the one which shows the utmost solicitude for the  safety of the guest. It is therefore not necessarily one fixed place,  but would usually be the one facing the door, so that the guest might  be in a position to see an enemy enter, and take measures accordingly.    Lap-dogs and cage-birds were kept as pets; 'wonks,' the _huang kou_,  or 'yellow dog,' were guards of houses and street scavengers. Aquaria  with goldfish were often to be seen in the houses of the upper and  middle classes, the gardens and courtyards of which usually contained  rockeries and artistic shrubs and flowers.    Whiskers were never worn, and moustaches and beards only after forty,  before which age the hair grew, if at all, very scantily. Full,  thick beards, as in the West, were practically never seen, even on  the aged. Snuff-bottles, tobacco-pipes, and fans were carried by both  sexes. Nails were worn long by members of the literary and leisured  classes. Non-Manchu women and girls had cramped feet, and both Manchu  and Chinese women used cosmetics freely.      Industrial Institutions    While the men attended to farm-work, women took care of the  mulberry-orchards and silkworms, and did spinning, weaving, and  embroidery. This, the primitive division of labour, held throughout,  though added to on both sides, so that eventually the men did most  of the agriculture, arts, production, distribution, fighting, etc.,  and the women, besides the duties above named and some field-labour,  mended old clothes, drilled and sharpened needles, pasted tin-foil,  made shoes, and gathered and sorted the leaves of the tea-plant. In  course of time trades became highly specialized--their number being  legion--and localized, bankers, for instance, congregating in Shansi,  carpenters in Chi Chou, and porcelain-manufacturers in Jao Chou,  in Kiangsi.    As to land, it became at an early age the property of the sovereign,  who farmed it out to his relatives or favourites. It was arranged on  the _ching_, or 'well' system--eight private squares round a ninth  public square cultivated by the eight farmer families in common for the  benefit of the State. From the beginning to the end of the Monarchical  Period tenure continued to be of the Crown, land being unallodial, and  mostly held in clans or families, and not entailed, the conditions  of tenure being payment of an annual tax, a fee for alienation,  and money compensation for personal services to the Government,  generally incorporated into the direct tax as scutage. Slavery,  unknown in the earliest times, existed as a recognized institution  during the whole of the Monarchical Period.    Production was chiefly confined to human and animal labour, machinery  being only now in use on a large scale. Internal distribution  was carried on from numerous centres and at fairs, shops, markets,  etc. With few exceptions, the great trade-routes by land and sea have  remained the same during the last two thousand years. Foreign trade was  with Western Asia, Greece, Rome, Carthage, Arabia, etc., and from the  seventeenth century A.D. more generally with European countries. The  usual primitive means of conveyance, such as human beings, animals,  carts, boats, etc., were partly displaced by steam-vessels from  1861 onward.    Exchange was effected by barter, cowries of different values being the  prototype of coins, which were cast in greater or less quantity under  each reign. But until within recent years there was only one coin,  the copper cash, in use, bullion and paper notes being the other  media of exchange. Silver Mexican dollars and subsidiary coins came  into use with the advent of foreign commerce. Weights and measures  (which generally decreased from north to south), officially arranged  partly on the decimal system, were discarded by the people in ordinary  commercial transactions for the more convenient duodecimal subdivision.      Arts    Hunting, fishing, cooking, weaving, dyeing, carpentry, metallurgy,  glass-, brick-, and paper-making, printing, and book-binding were  in a more or less primitive stage, the mechanical arts showing much  servile imitation and simplicity in design; but pottery, carving,  and lacquer-work were in an exceptionally high state of development,  the articles produced being surpassed in quality and beauty by no  others in the world.      Agriculture and Rearing of Livestock    From the earliest times the greater portion of the available land was  under cultivation. Except when the country has been devastated by war,  the Chinese have devoted close attention to the cultivation of the  soil continuously for forty centuries. Even the hills are terraced for  extra growing-room. But poverty and governmental inaction caused much  to lie idle. There were two annual crops in the north, and five in two  years in the south. Perhaps two-thirds of the population cultivated the  soil. The methods, however, remained primitive; but the great fertility  of the soil and the great industry of the farmer, with generous but  careful use of fertilizers, enabled the vast territory to support an  enormous population. Rice, wheat, barley, buckwheat, maize, kaoliang,  several millets, and oats were the chief grains cultivated. Beans,  peas, oil-bearing seeds (sesame, rape, etc.), fibre-plants (hemp,  ramie, jute, cotton, etc.), starch-roots (taros, yams, sweet potatoes,  etc.), tobacco, indigo, tea, sugar, fruits, were among the more  important crops produced. Fruit-growing, however, lacked scientific  method. The rotation of crops was not a usual practice, but grafting,  pruning, dwarfing, enlarging, selecting, and varying species were well  understood. Vegetable-culture had reached a high state of perfection,  the smallest patches of land being made to bring forth abundantly. This  is the more creditable inasmuch as most small farmers could not afford  to purchase expensive foreign machinery, which,"]]]
