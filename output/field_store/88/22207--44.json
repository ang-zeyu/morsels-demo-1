As for a book to start with, I often  use the one by Damm, though any foundational work may be employed, so  long as correct principles are taught. It is said by Leschetizky that he  has no method. That may be understood to mean a book, for he certainly  has what others would call a method. There are principles and various  sets of exercises to be learned; but it is quite true that none of the  Vorbereiters use a book.    \"In teaching the piano, as you know, every pupil is different; each has  his or her own peculiar hand, and a different degree of intelligence. So  each pupil must be treated differently. This is really an advantage to  the teacher; for it would be very monotonous if all pupils were alike.    \"The piano is such a revealer of character; I need only to hear a person  play to know what sort of character he has. If one is inclined to much  careful detail in everything, it comes out in the playing. If one is  indolent and indifferent, it is seen the moment one touches the keys; or  if one is built on broad, generous lines, and sees the dramatic point in  life and things, all this is revealed at the piano.    \"To refer again to the subject of finger action. I do not believe in the  so-called finger stroke; on the contrary I advocate fingers close to the  keys, clinging to them whenever you can. This is also Arthur Schnabel's  idea. You should hear Schnabel; all Berlin is wild over him, and  whenever he gives a concert the house is sold out. He has quantities of  pupils also, and is quite a remarkable teacher. One point I insist upon  which he doesn't: I will not allow the joint of the finger next the tip  to break or give in. I can not stand that, but Schnabel doesn't seem to  care about it; his mind is filled with only the big, broad things of  music.    \"In regard to memorizing piano compositions. I do it phrase by phrase,  and at the instrument, unless I am traveling or unable to get to a  piano, in which case I think it out from the notes. If the piece is very  difficult I take a short passage of two or three measures and play each  hand separately and then together; but generally I play the passage  complete--say half a dozen times with the notes, and then repeat it the  same number of times from memory. Perhaps the next day I have forgotten  it, so the work has to be done over again; the second time, however, it  generally sticks.    \"My great longing and ambition is to write music, to become a composer.  With this end in view, I give whatever time I am able to the study of  composition. I hope some day to create something that will be worthy the  high aim I have before me.\"          VIII      BERTHA FIERING TAPPER    MASTERING PIANISTIC PROBLEMS      If environment and atmosphere are inspirational aids to piano teaching  and playing, the students of Mrs. Thomas Tapper have the incentives of  both in their lesson hours. Her apartments on the Drive have the glory  of sunlight all the long afternoons. Outside the Hudson shimmers in blue  and gold; indoors all is harmonious and home-like. In the large  music-room, facing the river, two grand pianos stand side by side; there  are many portraits and mementoes of the great in music; fresh flowers,  books--everything to uplift thought; while in the midst of it all is  Mrs. Tapper herself, the serious, high-minded, inspiring teacher; the  \"mother confessor\" to a large number of young artists and teachers.    \"Music study means so much more than merely exercising the fingers,\" she  said; \"the student should have a good all-round education. When young  people come to me for instruction, I ask what they are doing in school.  If they say they have left school in order to devote their whole time to  the piano, I say, 'Go back to your school, and come to me later, when  you have finished your school course.' It is true that in rare cases it  may be advisable for the student to leave school, but he should then  pursue general or special studies at home. I often wish the music  student's education in this country could be arranged as it is in at  least one of the great music schools in Russia. There the mornings are  given to music, while general studies are taken up later in the day. It  is really a serious problem, here in America, this fitting in music with  other studies. Both public and private schools try to cover so much  ground that there is very little time left for music or anything else.  The music pupil also needs to know musical literature, history and  biography, to be familiar with the lives and writings of the great  composers. Take the letters and literary articles of Robert Schumann,  for instance. How interesting and inspiring they are!    \"In regard to methods in piano study my principles are based wholly upon  my observations of Leschetizky's work with me personally, or with  others. What I know he has taught me; what I have achieved I owe to  him. My first eight weeks in Vienna were spent in learning, first, to  control position and condition of hands and arms according to the law of  balance; secondly, to direct each motion with the utmost accuracy and  speed. To accomplish this I began with the most elementary exercises in  five-finger position, using one finger at a time. Then came the  principles of the scale, arpeggios, chords and octaves. All these things  were continued until every principle was mastered. I practised at first  an hour a day, then increased the amount as my hands grew stronger and  the number of exercises increased.    \"Next came the study of tone production in various forms, a good quality  invariably being the result of a free condition of the arm combined with  strength of fingers and hands.    \"The Leschetizky principles seem to me the most perfect and correct in  every particular. Yes, there are several books of the method, by  different authors, but I teach the principles without a book. The  principles themselves are the essential things. I aim to build up the  hand, to make it strong and dependable in every part, to fill out the  weak places and equalize it. That this may be thoroughly and  successfully accomplished, I require that nothing but technical  exercises be used for the first nine, ten, or twelve weeks. We begin  with the simplest exercises, one finger at a time, then two, three and  so on through the hand. I believe in thus devoting all the practise time  to technic, for a certain period, so that the mind is free to master the  principles, undisturbed by piece playing. When the principles have been  assimilated, the attention can then be directed to the study of music  itself. If any weak places appear in the hand from time to time, they  can be easily corrected.    \"If a pupil comes to me who has played a great deal but with no idea of  the principles of piano playing, who does not know how to handle herself  or the keyboard, it is absolutely necessary to stop everything and get  ready to play. If you attempt even a simple sonata with no legato touch,  no idea of chord or scale playing, you can not make the piece sound like  anything. It is like a painter trying to paint without brushes, or an  artist attempting to make a pen and ink drawing with a blunt lead  pencil; to do good work you must have the tools to work with.    \"For application of all principles, the studies of Czerny, Op. 299, 740,  and others, offer unequaled opportunity. They are simple, direct, and  give the student a chance for undivided attention to every position  taken and to every motion made.    \"What happens afterward is altogether according to the individual  characteristics of the student. How to recognize these and deal with  them to the best advantage is the interesting task of my great master  (and those who try to follow in his steps)--the man of keenest  intelligence, of profound learning and experience. To learn this lesson  from him has been my greatest aim, and to see him at work, as it has  been my privilege to do for several summers, has been of the greatest  influence and inspiration in my own work.    \"My chief endeavor is to create a desire for good musicianship. To this  end I insist upon the study of theory, harmony, ear-training and  analysis. In the piano lessons I do not have sufficient time to teach  these things. I have assistant teachers who help me with these subjects  and also with the technical training. Once a month during the season, my  assistant teachers bring their pupils to play for me, and we have a  class in piano teaching. There are sometimes eighteen or twenty students  who come to a class. I can in this way supervise all the work done, and  keep in touch with my teachers, their work, and with all the students.    \"On the first Saturday of the month I have my own pupils here for a  class; they play for me and for each other. Everything is played from  memory, not a printed note is used. Students tell me it is very  difficult to play here, where all listen so intently. Especially is it  difficult the first time a student plays in class, to keep the mind  wholly on what he is doing, with sufficient concentration. Later on, at  the end of the season, it comes easier.    \"This idea of separating the technical work at the outset from the study  of music itself, secures, in my opinion, the most perfect foundation,  and later on the best results. It is sometimes wonderful how, with  proper training, the hand will improve and develop in a comparatively  short time. I often marvel at it myself.\"    The writer had the privilege of being one of the guests at the last  audition of the season. Eight or nine young artists played a long and  difficult program. Among the numbers were a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#7)"],[1,"centre of Scorpio, and  the Winter solstice in the centre of Aquarius--corresponding roughly,  Mr. Maunder points out, to the positions of the four \"Royal Stars,\"  Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares and Fomalhaut.      The sacrifice of the Bull became the image of redemption. In a certain  well-known Mithra-sculpture or group, the Sungod is represented as  plunging his dagger into a bull, while a scorpion, a serpent, and other  animals are sucking the latter's blood. From one point of view this may  be taken as symbolic of the Sun fertilizing the gross Earth by plunging  his rays into it and so drawing forth its blood for the sustenance of  all creatures; while from another more astronomical aspect it symbolizes  the conquest of the Sun over winter in the moment of \"passing over\" the  sign of the Bull, and the depletion of the generative power of the Bull  by the Scorpion--which of course is the autumnal sign of the Zodiac  and herald of winter. One such Mithraic group was found at Ostia, where  there was a large subterranean Temple \"to the invincible god Mithras.\"    In the worship of Attis there were (as I have already indicated) many  points of resemblance to the Christian cult. On the 22nd March (the  Vernal Equinox) a pinetree was cut in the woods and brought into the  Temple of Cybele. It was treated almost as a divinity, was decked  with violets, and the effigy of a young man tied to the stem (cf. the  Crucifixion). The 24th was called the \"Day of Blood\"; the High Priest  first drew blood from his own arms; and then the others gashed and  slashed themselves, and spattered the altar and the sacred tree with  blood; while novices made themselves eunuchs \"for the kingdom of  heaven's sake.\" The effigy was afterwards laid in a tomb. But when  night fell, says Dr. Frazer, (1) sorrow was turned to joy. A light was  brought, and the tomb was found to be empty. The next day, the 25th, was  the festival of the Resurrection; and ended in carnival and license  (the Hilaria). Further, says Dr. Frazer, these mysteries \"seem to have  included a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood.\"     (1) See Adonis, Attis and Osiris, Part IV of The Golden Bough, by  J. G. Frazer, p. 229.      \"In the baptism the devotee, crowned with gold and wreathed with  fillets, descended into a pit, the mouth of which was covered with a  wooden grating. A bull, adorned with garlands of flowers, its forehead  glittering with gold leaf, was then driven on to the grating and there  stabbed to death with a consecrated spear. Its hot reeking blood  poured in torrents through the apertures, and was received with devout  eagerness by the worshiper on every part of his person and garments,  till he emerged from the pit, drenched, dripping, and scarlet from head  to foot, to receive the homage, nay the adoration, of his fellows--as  one who had been born again to eternal life and had washed away his sins  in the blood of the bull.\" (1) And Frazer continuing says: \"That the  bath of blood derived from slaughter of the bull (tauro-bolium)  was believed to regenerate the devotee for eternity is proved by an  inscription found at Rome, which records that a certain Sextilius  Agesilaus Aedesius, who dedicated an altar to Attis and the mother of  the gods (Cybele) was taurobolio criobolio que in aeternum renatus.\"  (2) \"In the procedure of the Taurobolia and Criobolia,\" says Mr. J. M.  Robertson, (3) \"which grew very popular in the Roman world, we have the  literal and original meaning of the phrase 'washed in the blood of the  lamb' (4); the doctrine being that resurrection and eternal life  were secured by drenching or sprinkling with the actual blood of a  sacrificial bull or ram.\" (5) For the POPULARITY of the rite we may  quote Franz Cumont, who says:--\"Cette douche sacree (taurobolium) pareit  avoir ete administree en Cappadoce dans un grand nombre de sanctuaires,  et en particulier dans ceux de Ma la grande divinite indigene, et dans  ceux: de Anahita.\"     (1) See vol. i, pp. 334 ff.     (2) Adonis, Attis and Osiris, p. 229. References to Prudentius,  and to Firmicus Maternus, De errore 28. 8.     (3) That is, \"By the slaughter of the bull and the slaughter of  the ram born again into eternity.\"     (4) Pagan Christs, p. 315.     (5) Mysteres de Mithra, Bruxelles, 1902, p. 153.      Whether Mr. Robertson is right in ascribing to the priests (as he  appears to do) so materialistic a view of the potency of the actual  blood is, I should say, doubtful. I do not myself see that there is  any reason for supposing that the priests of Mithra or Attis regarded  baptism by blood very differently from the way in which the Christian  Church has generally regarded baptism by water--namely, as a SYMBOL of  some inner regeneration. There may certainly have been a little more  of the MAGICAL view and a little less of the symbolic, in the older  religions; but the difference was probably on the whole more one of  degree than of essential disparity. But however that may be, we cannot  but be struck by the extraordinary analogy between the tombstone  inscriptions of that period \"born again into eternity by the blood of  the Bull or the Ram,\" and the corresponding texts in our graveyards  to-day. F. Cumont in his elaborate work, Textes et Monuments relatifs  aux Mysteres de Mithra (2 vols., Brussels, 1899) gives a great number of  texts and epitaphs of the same character as that above-quoted, and they  are well worth studying by those interested in the subject. Cumont, it  may be noted (vol. i, p. 305), thinks that the story of Mithra and the  slaying of the Bull must have originated among some pastoral people to  whom the bull was the source of all life. The Bull in heaven--the symbol  of the triumphant Sungod--and the earthly bull, sacrificed for the good  of humanity were one and the same; the god, in fact, SACRIFICED HIMSELF  OR HIS REPRESENTATIVE. And Mithra was the hero who first won this  conception of divinity for mankind--though of course it is in essence  quite similar to the conception put forward by the Christian Church.    As illustrating the belief that the Baptism by Blood was accompanied by  a real regeneration of the devotee, Frazer quotes an ancient writer  (1) who says that for some time after the ceremony the fiction of a new  birth was kept up by dieting the devotee on MILK, like a new-born  babe. And it is interesting in that connection to find that even in the  present day a diet of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT MILK for six or eight  weeks is by many doctors recommended as the only means of getting rid  of deep-seated illnesses and enabling a patient's organism to make a  completely new start in life.     (1) Sallustius philosophus. See Adonis, Attis and Osiris, note,  p. 229.      \"At Rome,\" he further says (p. 230), \"the new birth and the remission  of sins by the shedding of bull's blood appear to have been carried  out above all at the sanctuary of the Phrygian Goddess (Cybele) on  the Vatican Hill, at or near the spot where the great basilica of St.  Peter's now stands; for many inscriptions relating to the rites were  found when the church was being enlarged in 1608 or 1609. From  the Vatican as a centre,\" he continues, \"this barbarous system of  superstition seems to have spread to other parts of the Roman empire.  Inscriptions found in Gaul and Germany prove that provincial sanctuaries  modelled their ritual on that of the Vatican.\"    It would appear then that at Rome in the quiet early days of the  Christian Church, the rites and ceremonials of Mithra and Cybele,  probably much intermingled and blended, were exceedingly popular. Both  religions had been recognized by the Roman State, and the Christians,  persecuted and despised as they were, found it hard to make any headway  against them--the more so perhaps because the Christian doctrines  appeared in many respects to be merely faint replicas and copies of the  older creeds. Robertson maintains (1) that a he-lamb was sacrificed in  the Mithraic mysteries, and he quotes Porphyry as saying (2) that  \"a place near the equinoctial circle was assigned to Mithra as an  appropriate seat; and on this account he bears the sword of the Ram  (Aries) which is a sign of Mars (Ares).\" Similarly among the early  Christians, it is said, a ram or lamb was sacrificed in the Paschal  mystery.     (1) Pagan Christs, p. 336.     (2) De Antro, xxiv.      Many people think that the association of the Lamb-god with the Cross  arose from the fact that the constellation Aries at that time WAS on the  heavenly cross (the crossways of the Ecliptic and Equator-see diagram,  ch. iii), and in the very place through which the Sungod had to pass  just before his final triumph. And it is curious to find that Justin  Martyr in his Dialogue with Trypho (1) (a Jew) alludes to an old Jewish  practice of roasting a Lamb on spits arranged in the form of a Cross.  \"The lamb,\" he says, meaning apparently the Paschal lamb, \"is roasted  and dressed up in the form of a cross. For one spit is transfixed right  through the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to  which are attached the legs (forelegs) of the lamb.\"     (1) Ch. xl.      To-day in Morocco at the festival of Eid-el-Kebir, corresponding to the  Christian Easter, the Mohammedans sacrifice a young ram and hurry it  still bleeding to the precincts of the Mosque, while at the same time  every household slays a lamb, as in the Biblical institution, for its  family feast.    But it will perhaps be said, \"You are going too fast and proving too  much. In the anxiety to show that the Lamb-god and the sacrifice of the  Lamb were honored by the devotees of Mithra and Cybele in the Rome of  the Christian era, you are forgetting that the sacrifice of the Bull and  the baptism in bull's blood were the salient features of the Persian and  Phrygian ceremonials, some centuries earlier. How can you reconcile  the existence side by side of divinities belonging to such"]]]
