Remove from fire, add ham and mix well. Add egg yolks, first beating  these well; also the parsley (one tablespoon), onion and paprika. Fold  in, last of all, the egg whites whipped to a stiff, dry froth. Turn  quickly into a well-greased baking dish and bake in moderate oven for  thirty-five minutes, or until firm to the touch; meantime, make the  parsley sauce, so that both can be served instantly when the souffle  is done; then it will not fall and grow tough.    For the parsley sauce, melt the butter in saucepan and stir in the  flour, stirring until perfectly smooth, then add the milk slowly,  stirring constantly; cook until thick, stir in the parsley and salt,  and serve at once in a gravy boat.      BATTLE PUDDING    BATTER      1 cup flour    1/2 cup milk    2 teaspoons baking powder    1 egg    4 tablespoons water    1/2 teaspoon salt    FILLING      2 cups coarsely chopped cold cooked meat    1 tablespoon drippings    1 medium-sized potato    1 cup stock or hot water    salt and pepper    1 small onion    Any cold meat may be used for this. Cut it into inch pieces. Slice the  onion and potato and fry in drippings until onion is slightly browned.  Add the meat and stock, or hot water, or dissolve in hot water any  left-over meat gravy. Cook all together until potato is soft, but not  crumbled; season with the pepper and salt. Thicken with a tablespoon  of flour and turn into a pudding dish.    Make a batter by sifting together flour, baking-powder and salt; stir  in the egg and milk, mixed with the water. Beat hard until free from  lumps, then pour over meat and vegetables in the pudding and bake  until brown.      CHINESE MUTTON      1 pint chopped cooked mutton    1 head shredded lettuce    1 can cooked peas    1/8 teaspoon pepper    1 tablespoon fat    1-1/2 cups broth    1 teaspoon of salt    Cook 15 minutes. Serve as a border around rice.      SHEPHERD'S PIE      2 cups chopped cooked mutton    1 teaspoon salt    1/8 teaspoon pepper    1/4 teaspoon curry powder    2 cups hominy    1 cup peas or carrots    1/2 pint of brown sauce or water    Put meat and vegetables in baking dish. Cover with rice, hominy, or  samp, which has been cooked. Bake until brown.      SCALLOPED HAM AND HOMINY      2 cups hominy (cooked)    1 cup chopped cooked ham    1/3 cup fat    1/3 cup flour    1 teaspoon of salt    1/8 teaspoon mustard    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    1 egg    1 cup milk    1/2 cup water    Melt the fat.

BEEF LOAF      1 tablespoon lemon juice    1 tablespoon sour pickle    2 teaspoons salt    1/8 teaspoon cayenne    1 teaspoon celery salt    To 1 tablespoon of gelatine, softened in 1/2 cup of cold water add 1  cup of hot tomato juice and pulp. Add seasoned meat. Chill and slice.  May be served with salad dressing.      BAKED HASH      1 cup chopped cooked meat    2 cups raw potato, cut fine    1 tablespoon onion juice    2 tablespoons chopped parsley    1/8 teaspoon pepper    1/4 cup drippings    1/2 cup gravy or water    Melt fat in frying pan. Put in all the other ingredients. Cook over a  slow fire for 1/2 hour. Fold and serve as omelet.      MEAT SHORTCAKE      1-1/2 cups flour    1/2 teaspoon salt    3 tablespoons shortening    2 teaspoons baking powder    2 cups chopped, cooked meat    1 teaspoon onion juice    1/2 cup gravy or soup stock    Salt and pepper    3/4 cup milk and water    Mix flour, salt and baking powder. Rub in shortening, and mix to dough  with milk and water. Roll out to quarter of an inch thickness, bake  in layer cake tins. Put together with the chopped meat mixed with the  onion and seasoning, and heated hot with the gravy or stock. If stock  is used, thicken with a tablespoon of flour mixed with one of butter,  or butter substitute. Serve as soon as put together. Cold cooked fish  heated in cream sauce may be used for a filling instead of the meat.      SCRAPPLE    Place a pig's head in 4 quarts of cold water and bring slowly to the  boil. Skim carefully and season the liquid highly with salt, cayenne  and a teaspoon of rubbed sage. Let the liquid simmer gently until the  meat falls from the bones. Strain off the liquid, remove the bones,  and chop the meat fine.    Measure the liquid and allow 1 cup of sifted cornmeal to 3 cups of  liquid. Blend the cornmeal in the liquid and simmer until it is the  consistency of thick porridge. Stir in the chopped meat and pour in  greased baking pans to cool. One-third buckwheat may be used instead  of cornmeal, and any kind of chopped meat can be blended with the pork  if desired. Any type of savory herb can also be used, according to  taste.    When scrapple is to be eaten, cut into one-half inch slices, dredge  with flour, and brown in hot fat.      FISH AS A MEAT SUBSTITUTE    As the main course at a meal, fish may be served accompanied by  vegetables or it may be prepared as a \"one-meal dish\" requiring only  bread and butter and a simple dessert to complete a nutritious and  well balanced diet. A lack of proper knowledge of selection of fish  for the different methods of cooking, and the improper cooking of  fish once it is acquired, are responsible to a large extent for the  prejudice so frequently to be found against the use of fish.    The kinds of fish obtainable in different markets vary somewhat, but  the greatest difficulty for many housekeepers seems to be, to know  what fish may best be selected for baking, broiling, etc., and the  tests for fish when cooked. An invariable rule for cooking fish is  to apply high heat at first, until the flesh is well seared so as to  retain the juices; then a lower temperature until the flesh is cooked  throughout. Fish is thoroughly cooked when the flesh flakes. For  broiling or pan broiling, roll fish in flour or cornmeal, preferably  the latter, which has been well seasoned with salt and cayenne. This  causes the outside to be crisp and also gives added flavor. Leftover  bits of baked or other fish may be combined with white sauce or tomato  sauce, or variations of these sauces, and served as creamed fish, or  placed in a greased baking dish, crumbs placed on top and browned and  served as scalloped fish. Fish canapes, fish cocktail, fish soup or  chowder; baked, steamed, broiled or pan broiled fish, entrees without  number, and fish salad give opportunity to use it in endless variety.    Combined with starchy foods such as rice, hominy, macaroni, spaghetti  or potato, and accompanied by a green vegetable or fruit, the dish  becomes a meal. Leftover bits may also be utilized for salad, either  alone with cooked or mayonaise salad dressing, or combined with  vegetables such as peas, carrots, cucumbers, etc. The addition of a  small amount of chopped pickle to fish salad improves its flavor, or  a plain or tomato gelatine foundation may be used as a basis for the  salad. The appended lists of fish suitable for the various methods  of cooking, and the variety in the recipes for the uses of fish,  have been arranged to encourage a wider use of this excellent meat  substitute, so largely eaten by European epicures, but too seldom  included in American menus. During the period of the war, the larger  use of fish is a patriotic measure in that it will save the beef,  mutton and pork needed for our armies.

In fact, it may be absolutely necessary to destroy the  enemy's trade.' 'The private introduction of provisions into Paris was  prohibited during the siege, and in the same way a nation would be  justified in preventing the import of food and raw produce.'    \"The Government of Great Britain have frankly declared, in concert with  the Government of France, their intention to meet the German attempt to  stop all supplies of every kind from leaving or entering British or  French ports by themselves stopping supplies going to or from Germany.  For this end, the British fleet has instituted a blockade effectively  controlling by cruiser 'cordon' all passage to and from Germany by sea.  The difference between the two policies is, however, that, while our  object is the same as that of Germany, we propose to attain it without  sacrificing neutral ships or non-combatant lives, or inflicting upon  neutrals the damage that must be entailed when a vessel and its cargo  are sunk without notice, examination, or trial.    \"I must emphasize again that this measure is a natural and necessary  consequence of the unprecedented methods repugnant to all law and  morality which have been described above which Germany began to adopt at  the very outset of the war and the effects of which have been constantly  accumulating.\"    American Ambassador, London.      IV.    AMERICAN INQUIRY ON REPRISAL METHOD.    _The American Government on March 5 transmitted identic messages of  inquiry to the Ambassadors at London and Paris inquiring from both  England and France how the declarations in the Anglo-French note  proclaiming an embargo on all commerce between Germany and neutral  countries were to be carried into effect. The message to London was as  follows:_    WASHINGTON, March 5, 1915.    In regard to the recent communications received from the British and  French Governments concerning restraints upon commerce with Germany,  please communicate with the British Foreign Office in the sense  following:    The difficulty of determining action upon the British and French  declarations of intended retaliation upon commerce with Germany lies in  the nature of the proposed measures in their relation to commerce by  neutrals.    While it appears that the intention is to interfere with and take into  custody all ships, both outgoing and incoming, trading with Germany,  which is in effect a blockade of German ports, the rule of blockade that  a ship attempting to enter or leave a German port, regardless of the  character of its cargo, may be condemned is not asserted.    The language of the declaration is \"the British and French Governments  will, therefore, hold themselves free to detain and take into port ships  carrying goods of presumed enemy destination, ownership, or origin. It  is not intended to confiscate such vessels or cargoes unless they would  otherwise be liable to condemnation.\"    The first sentence claims a right pertaining only to a state of  blockade. The last sentence proposes a treatment of ships and cargoes as  if no blockade existed. The two together present a proposed course of  action previously unknown to international law.    As a consequence neutrals have no standard by which to measure their  rights or to avoid danger to their ships and cargoes. The paradoxical  situation thus created should be changed and the declaring powers ought  to assert whether they rely upon the rules governing a blockade or the  rules applicable when no blockade exists.    The declaration presents other perplexities. The last sentence quoted  indicates that the rules of contraband are to be applied to cargoes  detained. The rules covering non-contraband articles carried in neutral  bottoms is that the cargoes shall be released and the ships allowed to  proceed.    This rule cannot, under the first sentence quoted, be applied as to  destination. What, then, is to be done with a cargo of non-contraband  goods detained under the declaration? The same question may be asked as  to conditional contraband cargoes.    The foregoing comments apply to cargoes destined for Germany. Cargoes  coming out of German forts present another problem under the terms of  the declaration. Under the rules governing enemy exports only goods  owned by enemy subjects in enemy bottoms are subject to seizure and  condemnation. Yet by the declaration it is purposed to seize and take  into port all goods of enemy \"ownership and origin.\" The word \"origin\"  is particularly significant. The origin of goods destined to neutral  territory on neutral ships is not, and never has been, a ground for  forfeiture, except in case a blockade is declared and maintained. What,  then, would the seizure amount to in the present case except to delay  the delivery of the goods? The declaration does not indicate what  disposition would be made of such cargoes if owned by a neutral or if  owned by an enemy subject. Would a different rule be applied according  to ownership? If so, upon what principles of international law would it  rest? And upon what rule, if no blockade is declared and maintained,  could the cargo of a neutral ship sailing out of a German port be  condemned? If it is not condemned, what other legal course is there but  to release it?    While this Government is fully alive to the possibility that the methods  of modern naval warfare, particularly in the use of submarines for both  defensive and offensive operations, may make the former means of  maintaining a blockade a physical impossibility, it feels that it can be  urged with great force that there should be also some limit to \"the  radius of activity,\" and especially so if this action by the  belligerents can be construed to be a blockade. It would certainly  create a serious state of affairs if, for example, an American vessel  laden with a cargo of German origin should escape the British patrol in  European waters only to be held up by a cruiser off New York and taken  into Halifax.    Similar cablegrams sent to Paris.    BRYAN.      V.    BRITISH REPLY TO THE AMERICAN INQUIRY.    _The reply from the British Government transmitted by the American  Ambassador at London to the Secretary of State concerning the method of  enforcing the reprisal order follows:_    LONDON, March 15, 1915.    Following is the full text of a note dated today and an Order in Council  I have just received from Grey:    \"1. His Majesty's Government have had under careful consideration the  inquiries which, under instructions from your Government, your  Excellency addressed to me on the 8th inst., regarding the scope and  mode of application of the measures foreshadowed in the British and  French declarations of the 1st of March, for restricting the trade of  Germany. Your Excellency explained and illustrated by reference to  certain contingencies the difficulty of the United States Government in  adopting a definite attitude toward these measures by reason of  uncertainty regarding their bearing upon the commerce of neutral  countries.    \"2. I can at once assure your Excellency that subject to the paramount  necessity of restricting German trade his Majesty's Government have made  it their first aim to minimize inconvenience to neutral commerce. From  the accompanying copy of the Order in Council, which is to be published  today, you will observe that a wide discretion is afforded to the prize  court in dealing with the trade of neutrals in such manner as may, in  the circumstances, be deemed just, and that full provision is made to  facilitate claims by persons interested in any goods placed in the  custody of the Marshal of the prize court under the order. I apprehend  that the perplexities to which your Excellency refers will for the most  part be dissipated by the perusal of this document, and that it is only  necessary for me to add certain explanatory observations.    \"3. The effect of the Order in Council is to confer certain powers upon  the executive officers of his Majesty's Government. The extent to which  those powers will be actually exercised and the degree of severity with  which the measures of blockade authorized will be put into operation are  matters which will depend on the administrative orders issued by the  Government and the decisions of the authorities specially charged with  the duty of dealing with individual ships and cargoes, according to the  merits of each case. The United States Government may rest assured that  the instructions to be issued by his Majesty's Government to the fleet  and customs officials and Executive Committees concerned will impress  upon them the duty of acting with the utmost dispatch consistent with  the object in view, and of showing in every case such consideration for  neutrals as may be compatible with that object, which is, succinctly  stated, to establish a blockade to prevent vessels from carrying goods  for or coming from Germany.\"    [Illustration: HERR VON JAGOW    German Secretary for Foreign Affairs    _(Photo from Rogers)_]    [Illustration: MAXIMILIAN HARDEN    Editor of _Die Zukunft_, Germany's Most Brilliant Journalist, Who Has  Been Severe in His Strictures Upon the United States    _(Photo from Brown Bros.)_]    \"4.
