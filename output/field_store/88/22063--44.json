I didn't praise him, did I? You don't need to run him down!    LEONARD.    You still seem to take a lot of interest in him.    CLARA.    We used to play together as children, and afterward--you know very well!    LEONARD.    Oh yes, I know! And that's just why!    CLARA.    Then I think it was only natural, seeing him again for the first time  in a long while that way, for me to look at him and be astonished to see  how big and--[_She checks herself_.]    LEONARD.    Why did you blush then, when he looked back at you?    CLARA.    I thought he was looking at the little mole on my left cheek to see if  it, too, had grown bigger! You know I always imagine people are looking  at that when they stare at me so, and it always makes me blush. I have a  feeling as if it _were_ growing larger, as long as they look at it!    LEONARD.    However that may be, it got on my nerves, and I thought to myself: This  very evening I will put her to the test! If she wants to become my wife,  she knows that she risks nothing. If she says no, then--    CLARA.    Oh, you said a bad, bad word, when I pushed you back and jumped up from  the bench. The moon, which up to that time had shone in through the  foliage with such kindly consideration for me, at that moment sank  shrewdly behind the wet clouds. I wanted to hurry away, but felt  something holding me. At first I thought it was you, but it was the  rose-bush, whose thorns held my dress like teeth. You outraged my heart,  so that I no longer trusted it myself. You stood before me like one  demanding the payment of a debt! I--Oh, God!    [Illustration: ALFRED RETHEL DEATH AS CUP-BEARER]    LEONARD.    I cannot yet regret it. I knew it was the only way I could have kept you  to myself. The old girlhood love was opening its eyes again, and I could  not close them quickly enough!    CLARA.    When I got home, I found my mother ill, mortally ill. She had been  stricken suddenly, as if by an invisible hand. My father had wanted to  send for me, but she would not consent to his doing so, not wishing to  interrupt my happiness. And how I felt when I heard that! I held myself  aloof, I did not dare to touch her, I trembled! She took it for childish  anxiety and motioned me over to her; when I slowly drew near her, she  held me down and kissed my desecrated mouth. I lost control of myself; I  wanted to confess to her, to cry out what I thought and felt: It is my  fault that you are lying there! I tried to do so, but tears and sobs  choked my voice. She reached for my father's hand, and said with a  blissful glance at me: What a heart!    LEONARD.    She is well again. I have come to congratulate her, and--what do you  think?    CLARA.    What?    LEONARD.    To ask your father for your hand.    CLARA.    Oh!    LEONARD.    Don't you want me to?    CLARA.    Want you to? It will mean my death, if I do not become your wife pretty  soon! But you do not know my father! He does not understand why we are  in such a hurry--he cannot understand why, and we cannot tell him why!  And he has declared a hundred times that he will never give his daughter  to any man unless he has not only, as he says, love in his heart for  her, but also bread in his cupboard for her. He will say: Wait another  year or two, my son.--And what will be your answer?    LEONARD. You foolish girl, that difficulty is disposed of! I have the  position now--I am cashier!    CLARA.    You cashier? And the other applicant, the pastor's nephew?    LEONARD.    Was drunk when he came to the examination, bowed to the stove instead of  to the burgomaster, and when he sat down knocked three cups off the  table. You know how hot-headed the old fellow is. \"Sir!\" he exclaimed  angrily, but he restrained himself and bit his lip. Nevertheless his  eyes glared through his spectacles like the eyes of a serpent about to  spring, and his whole body became rigid. Then we started computing and,  ha! ha!--my rival computed with a multiplication table of his own  invention that gave entirely new results. \"He's way off in his  reckoning!\" said the burgomaster, and, glancing in my direction, held  out his hand to me with the appointment. It smelled terribly of tobacco,  but I took it and raised it humbly to my lips.--Here it is now, signed  and sealed!    CLARA.    That comes--    LEONARD.    Unexpectedly, doesn't it? Well, it was not altogether an accident  either. Why didn't I come to see you for two weeks?    CLARA.    How do I know? I think it was because we got angry at each other the  Sunday before!    LEONARD.    Oh, I was cunning enough to bring about that little disagreement on  purpose--so that I could stay away without its astonishing you too much!    CLARA.    I don't understand you!    LEONARD.    I suppose not. I took advantage of the time to pay court to the  burgomaster's little hump-backed niece, whom the old fellow thinks so  much of, and who is his right hand, just as the bailiff is his left.  Understand me correctly! I didn't say anything nice to her about  herself, except perhaps a compliment regarding her hair, which everybody  knows is red--so I just told her some nice things she liked to hear  about you.    CLARA.    About me?    LEONARD.    Why should I keep still about it? I did it with the best of  intentions--as if I had never intended to deal seriously with you, as  if--enough! That lasted until I got this in my hands, and the credulous  little man-crazy fool will find out what I meant when she hears the  banns of our marriage published in the church.    CLARA.    Leonard!    LEONARD.    Child! child! You be as innocent as a dove, and I will be as wise as a  serpent. Then, since a man and his wife are one, we shall entirely  satisfy the demand of the Gospel.    [_Laughs_.]    Neither was it altogether an accident that young Hermann was drunk at  the most important moment of his life. You have surely never heard that  the fellow is given to drinking?    CLARA.    Not a word.    LEONARD.    The fact made the execution of my scheme all the easier. It was done  with three glasses. I had a couple of friends of mine waylay him. \"May  one drink to your health?\"--\"Not now!\"--\"Oh, that is all arranged, you  know. Your uncle\"--\"And now, drink, my brother, drink!\"--This morning  when I was on my way to you, he stood leaning on the bridge and gazing  dejectedly down at the river. I greeted him sarcastically, and asked him  if he had dropped anything into the water. \"Yes,\" he answered, without  looking up, \"and perhaps it would be well for me to jump in after it.\"    CLARA.    You bad man! Get out of my sight!    LEONARD.    You mean it?    [_Moves, as if to go_.]    CLARA.    Oh, my God, I am chained to this man!    LEONARD.    Don't be a baby! And now one more word in confidence: Does your father  still keep the thousand thalers in the apothecary shop?    CLARA.    I know nothing about it.    LEONARD.    Nothing about so important a matter?    CLARA.    Here comes my father.    LEONARD.    Understand me! The apothecary is said to be on the verge of  bankruptcy--that's why I asked!    CLARA.    I must go into the kitchen! [_Exit_.]    LEONARD (_alone_).    Well, I guess there is nothing to be got here! I can't understand it at  all; for Master Antony is one of those fellows whose ghost, if you  should accidentally put one too many letters on his gravestone, would  haunt you until you took it off. For he would regard it as dishonest to  appropriate more of the alphabet than he was properly entitled to.        SCENE V    _Enter_ LEONARD; _Master_ ANTONY.    ANTONY.    Good morning, Mr. Cashier! [_He takes off his cap and puts on a woolen  cap_.] Is it permissible for an old man to keep his head covered?    LEONARD.    You know then--    ANTONY.    Since yesterday evening. When I was going over in the dusk to take the  deceased miller's measure for his final sleeping room, I heard a couple  of your good friends slandering you. I thought right away: I guess  Leonard has not broken his neck.--At the house I heard more about it  from the sexton, who had come to console the widow, and, incidentally,  to get drunk.    LEONARD.    And you had to let Clara find out about it from me?    ANTONY.    If you didn't care enough about it to give the girl that pleasure  yourself, why should I do it? I don't light any candles in my house  except those that belong to me. Then I know that nobody is going to come  and blow them out, just as we are beginning to enjoy them.    LEONARD.    Surely you don't think that I--    ANTONY.    Think? About you? About anybody? I smooth over boards with my plane, but  I never smooth over men with my thoughts. I stopped that sort of  foolishness long ago. When I see a tree growing, I think to myself: It  will soon be blossoming; and when it sprouts: It will soon bear fruit.  In that I never see myself disappointed, and for that reason I don't  give up the old habit. But about men I never think anything, good or  bad, and then I don't have to turn alternately red and white when they  disappoint my fears one minute and my hopes the next. I merely observe  them and use the evidence of my eyes, which likewise do not think, but  only see. I thought I had made a complete observation of you, but now  that I find you here I must confess that it was only half an  observation.    LEONARD.    Master Antony, you have it all upside down. Trees are dependent upon  wind and weather, whereas men have laws and rules in themselves to  govern them.    ANTONY.    Do you think so? Yes, we old people owe hearty thanks to death for  allowing us to run around so long among you young folks, thereby giving  us an opportunity to educate ourselves. Formerly the stupid world used  to think that the father was there to educate his son. But now the son  is supposed to give his father the final touch of perfection, so that  the poor, simple man will not need to feel ashamed of himself before the  worms "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13033"],[0,"Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia, Volume 2 (#7)"],[1,"27.    This day being Sunday I halted; especially as the cattle had made an  unusually long journey the day before. I wished to take sights for the  purpose of ascertaining the rate of my chronometer, and to lay down my  surveys. I found that Mr. Oxley's points on this river were much too far  to the westward; a circumstance to be expected as his survey could not,  at that early age of the colony, be connected with Parramatta by actual  measurement; as mine was. Our latitudes however agreed very exactly.    ASCEND MOUNT AMYOT.    March 28.    Continued our journey and, at only a mile and a half from our camp, I was  surprised to find myself at the foot of Mount Amyot, better known to  stockmen by its native name of Camerberdang. I gave the party a bearing  or distant object to advance upon; and I lost no time in ascending the  hill, followed by Woods with my theodolite. From its crest, low as it  was, I still recognised the Canobolas and ascertained from my drawings  formerly made there that even on this hill (Mount Amyot) I had taken an  angle from their summit last season. It was valuable now, enabling me to  determine the true place of the hill from which I was to extend my angles  further westward. I easily recognised Marga and Nangar, and a very useful  and remarkable point of my former survey to the northward of those hills,  also several still more conspicuous ones in the country beyond the  Lachlan.    FIELD'S PLAINS.    To the westward I beheld the view etched in Mr. Oxley's book as Field's  Plains; and what was of much more importance to me then, Mounts  Cunningham, Melville, Allan, etc. etc. on all which, as far as I could, I  took angles, and then descending, rejoined the party about six miles on.  I met at the foot of this hill a colonist, a native of the country.* He  said he had been seventy miles down the river in search of a run for his  cattle; but had found none; and he assured me that, without the aid of  the blacks who were with him on horseback, he could not have obtained  water.    (*Footnote. Mr. James Collits of Mount York.)    Mount Amyot had the appearance of granite from the plains, but I found  that it consisted of the ferruginous sandstone. It is the southern  extremity of a long ridge elevated not more than 200 feet above the  plains at its base. We encamped at a bend of the river, on the border of  a small plain named Merumba in latitude 33 degrees 19 minutes 16 seconds  South. Variation 8 degrees 54 minutes 15 seconds East.    We were here disturbed by herds of cattle running towards our spare  bullocks and mixing with them and the horses. In no district have I seen  cattle so numerous as all along the Lachlan; and notwithstanding the very  dry season, they were nearly all in good condition. We found this day,  near the river bed, a new herbaceous indigo with white flowers and pods  like those of the prickly liquorice (Glycyrrhiza echinata).*    (*Footnote. I. acantho carpa, Lindley manuscripts; caule herbaceo erecto  ramisque angulatis scabriusculis, foliis pinnatis 5-jugis  viscido-pubescentibus; foliolis lineari-lanceolatis mucronulatis margine  scabris, racemis folio aequalibus, leguminibus subrotundo-ovalibus  compressis mucronatis echinatis monospermis.)    March 29.    Our next point was Mount Cunningham (Beery birree of the natives) and we  travelled towards it along the margin of Field's Plains as the angles of  the river allowed.    CRACKS IN THE SURFACE.    This was our straightest course, but we had to keep along the riverbank  for another reason. The plains were full of deep cracks and holes so that  the cart wheels more than once sunk into them, and thus detained us for  nearly an hour. A sagacious black advised us to keep near the riverbank,  and we found the ground better. We encamped at half-past two o'clock,  after a journey of ten miles; and I immediately set out, accompanied by a  native and a man carrying my theodolite, both on horseback, for the  highest or northern point of Mount Cunningham (a). The distance was full  five miles; yet we could not proceed direct on horseback, the scorched  plains being full of deep, wide cracks; and we were therefore compelled  to take a circuitous route nearer the river.    ASCEND MOUNT CUNNINGHAM.    There our guide called up three savage-looking natives with spears, whom  he described to be the natives of the hill, and they accompanied us to  the top. With some difficulty we led our horses near the crest, our new  friends always keeping the vantage ground of us, apparently from  apprehension. At length I planted my theodolite on the highest part of  the summit which commanded a fine view of the western horizon; and from  the mouths of my sable guides I obtained the native names, in all their  purity, of the various hills in sight. The most distant, named Bolloon,  were said to be near the great lake Cudjallagong--no doubt Regent's Lake  of Oxley--and a peak they called Tolga I took to be Hurd's Peak of the  same traveller.    NYORORONG.    Still I saw nothing on the horizon in the direction of his Mount Granard,  and in no other any hill of magnitude, except in the quarter whence I  came, where I still discerned my old friends Marga and Nangar, with  Nyororong and Berabidjal, high hills more to the southward.    Mount Cunningham consists of ferruginous sandstone. The sun had reached  the horizon before I left the summit, which I did not until I had  obtained an angle on every visible point. We arrived at the camp soon  after seven o'clock. Latitude by an observation of Cor Leonis 33 degrees  15 minutes 27 seconds South.    MR. OXLEY'S TREE.    March 30.    I ascertained accidentally this morning that we were abreast of the spot  where Mr. Oxley left the Lachlan and proceeded southward. This I learnt  from a marked tree which a native pointed out to me distant about 250  yards south from our camp, on the opposite side of a branch of the river.  On this tree were still legible the names of Mr. Oxley and Mr. Evans; and  although the inscription had been there nineteen years the tree seemed  still in full vigour; nor could its girth have altered much, judging from  the letters which were still as sharp as when first cut, only the bark  having overgrown part of them had been recently cleared away a little as  if to render the letters more legible. I endeavoured to preserve still  longer an inscription which had withstood the fires of the bush and the  tomahawks of the natives for such a length of time by making a drawing of  it as it then appeared.    By Mr. Oxley's journal we learn that where the river formed two branches  he, on the 17th of May, 1817, hauled up his boats, and on the following  day commenced his intended journey towards the south-east. But our  latitudes also assisted us in verifying the spot. Mr. Oxley made the  latitude of his camp (doubtless near the tree) 33 degrees 15 minutes 34  seconds South which gives a difference of seven seconds for the 250 yards  between the tree and my camp. The variation of the needle Mr. Oxley found  to be here, in 1817, 7 degrees 0 minutes 8 seconds East and I had made it  at the last camp (Merimbah) 8 degrees 54 minutes 15 seconds East, or  nearly two degrees more, in a lapse of 19 years. The longitude of this  point as now ascertained by trigonometrical measurement from Parramatta  was 147 degrees 33 minutes 50 seconds East, or 17 minutes 50 seconds  (equal on this parallel to 17 1/4 miles) nearer to Sydney than it is laid  down by Mr. Oxley.    We proceeded from this camp towards the southern extremity of Mount  Cunningham, under which a small branch of the Lachlan passes so close  that the party was occupied an hour and a half in removing rocks to open  a passage for the carts. We then got into an open country in which we  soon saw the same dry branch of the Lachlan before us; but we turned more  to the north-west until we reached a slightly undulated surface. No  branch of the river extends to the northward of Mount Cunningham as shown  on Mr. Oxley's map; but a small tributary watercourse, then dry, skirts  the eastern side of the hill, and enters that branch of the Lachlan which  we were upon.    Yesterday and this day had been so excessively hot (82 degrees in the  shade) that I confidently anticipated rain, especially when the sky  became cloudy to the westward, while the wind blew steadily from the  opposite quarter. A dense body of vapour in the shape of stratus, or fall  cloud of the meteorologist, was at the same time stretching eastward  along the distant horizon on both sides of us. After crossing some sound,  open plains of stiff clay, guided by the natives, we gained an extensive  pond of muddy water and encamped on a hill of red sand on its northern  bank, and under shelter of a grove of callitris trees.    RAIN.    The wind now began to blow and the sky, to my great delight, being at  length overcast, promised rain enough to fill the streams and waterholes:  at twilight it began to come down. In the woods we passed through this  day we found a curious willow-like acacia with the leaves slightly  covered with bloom, and sprinkled on the underside with numerous reddish  minute drops of resin.* The Pittosporum angustifolium we also recognised  here, loaded with its singular orange-coloured bivalved fruit.    (*Footnote. This is allied in some respects to A. verniciflua and  exudans, but is a very distinct and well-marked species. A. salicina,  Lindley manuscripts; glaucescens, ramulis angulatis, phyllodiis  divaricatis lineari et oblongo-lanceolatis utrinque angustatis  obtusissimis uninerviis venulis pinnatis: ipso apice glandulosis subtus  resinoso-punctatis, capitulis 3-5 racemosis phyllodiis triplo  brevioribus.)    March 31.    It rained during the night and this morning the sky seemed as if it would  continue; the mercury in the barometer also falling, we halted. On a dry  sandhill, with wood and water at hand, we were well prepared to await the"]]]
