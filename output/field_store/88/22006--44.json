[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"will suffice here to make known the general march of events  and the most characteristic incidents.    Four distinct periods may be recognized in this history; and each marks a  different phase in the course of events, and, so to speak, an act of the  drama.  During the first period, which lasted forty-two years, from 391  to 349 B.C., the Gauls carried on a war of aggression and conquest  against Rome.  Not that such had been their original design; on the  contrary, they replied, when the Romans offered intervention between them  and Clusium, \"We ask only for lands, of which we are in need; and Clusium  has more than she can cultivate.  Of the Romans we know very little; but  we believe them to be a brave people, since the Etruscans put themselves  under their protection.  Remain spectators of our quarrel; we will settle  it before your eyes, that you may report at home how far above other men  the Gauls are in valor.\"    But when they saw their pretensions repudiated and themselves treated  with outrageous disdain, the Gauls left the siege of Clusium on the spot,  and set out for Rome, not stopping for plunder, and proclaiming  everywhere on their march, \"We are bound for Rome; we make war on none  but Romans;\" and when they encountered the Roman army, on the 16th of  duly, 390 B.C., at the confluence of the Allia and the Tiber, half a  day's march from Rome, they abruptly struck up their war-chant, and threw  themselves upon their enemies.  It is well known how they gained the day;  how they entered Rome, and found none but a few gray-beards, who, being  unable or unwilling to leave their abode, had remained seated in the  vestibule on their chairs of ivory, with truncheons of ivory in their  hands, and decorated with the insignia of the public offices they had  filled.  All the people of Rome had fled, and were wandering over the  country, or seeking a refuge amongst neighboring peoples.  Only the  senate and a thousand warriors had shut themselves up in the Capitol, a  citadel which commanded the city.  The Gauls kept them besieged there for  seven months.  The circumstances of this celebrated siege are well known,  though they have been a little embellished by the Roman historians.  Not  that they have spoken too highly of the Romans themselves, who, in the  day of their country's disaster, showed admirable courage, perseverance,  and hopefulness.  Pontius Cominius, who traversed the Gallic camp, swam  the Tiber, and scaled by night the heights of the Capitol, to go and  carry news to the senate; M. Manlius, who was the first, and for some  moments the only one, to hold in check, from the citadel's walls, the  Gauls on the point of effecting an entrance; and M. Furius Camillus, who  had been banished from Rome the preceding year, and had taken refuge in  the town of Ardea, and who instantly took the field for his country,  rallied the Roman fugitives, and incessantly harassed the Gauls--are true  heroes, who have earned their weed of glory.  Let no man seek to lower  them in public esteem.  Noble actions are so beautiful, and the actors  often receive so little recompense, that we are at least bound to hold  sacred the honor attached to their name.    [Illustration: The Gauls in Rome----39]    The Roman historians have done no more than justice in extolling the  saviors of Rome.  But their memory would have suffered no loss had the  whole truth been made known; and the claims of national vanity are not of  the same weight as the duty one owes to truth.  Now, it is certain that  Camillus did not gain such decisive advantages over the Gauls as the  Roman accounts would lead one to believe, and that the deliverance of  Rome was much less complete.  On the 13th of February, 389 B.C., the  Gauls, it is true, allowed their retreat to be purchased by the Romans;  and they experienced, as they retired, certain checks, whereby they lost  a part of their booty.  But twenty-three years afterwards they are found  in Latium scouring in every direction the outlying country of Rome,  without the Romans daring to go out and fight them.  It was only at the  end of five years, in the year 361 B.C., that, the very city being  menaced anew, the legions marched out to meet the enemy.  \"Surprised at  this audacity,\" says Polybius, \"the Gauls fell back, but merely a few  leagues from Rome, to the environs of Tibur; and thence, for the space of  twelve years, they attacked the Roman territory, renewing the campaign  every year, often reaching the very gates of the city, and being repulsed  indeed, but never farther than Tibur and its slopes.\"  Rome, however, made  great efforts, every war with the Gauls was previously proclaimed a  tumult, which involved a levy in mass of the citizens, without any  exemption, even for old men and priests.  A treasure, specially dedicated  to Gallic wars, was laid by in the Capitol, and religious denunciations  of the most awful kind hung over the head of whoever should dare to touch  it, no matter what the exigency might be.  To this epoch belonged those  marvels of daring recorded in Roman tradition, those acts of heroism  tinged with fable, which are met with amongst so many peoples, either in  their earliest age, or in their days of great peril.  In the year 361  B.C., Titus Manlius, son of him who had saved the Capitol from the night  attack of the Gauls, and twelve years later M. Valerius, a young military  tribune, were, it will be remembered, the two Roman heroes who vanquished  in single combat the two Gallic giants who insolently defied Rome.  The  gratitude towards them was general and of long duration, for two  centuries afterwards (in the year 167 B.C.) the head of the Gaul with his  tongue out still appeared at Rome, above the shop of a money-changer, on  a circular sign-board, called \"the Kymrian shield\" (scutum Cimbricum).  After seventeen years' stay in Latium, the Gauls at last withdrew, and  returned to their adopted country in those lovely valleys of the Po which  already bore the name of Cisalpine Gaul.  They began to get disgusted  with a wandering life.  Their population multiplied; their towns spread;  their fields were better cultivated; their manners became less barbarous.  For fifty years there was scarcely any trace of hostility or even contact  between them and the Romans.  But at the beginning of the third century  before our era, the coalition of the Samnites and Etruscans against Rome  was near its climax; they eagerly pressed the Gauls to join, and the  latter assented easily.  Then commenced the second period of struggles  between the two peoples.  Rome had taken breath, and had grown much more  rapidly than her rivals.  Instead of shutting herself up, as heretofore,  within her walls, she forthwith raised three armies, took the offensive  against the coalitionists, and carried the war into their territory.  The  Etruscans rushed to the defence of their hearths.  The two consuls,  Fabius and Decius, immediately attacked the Samnites and Gauls at the  foot of the Apennines, close to Sentinum (now Sentina).  The battle was  just beginning, when a hind, pursued by a wolf from the mountains, passed  in flight between the two armies, and threw herself upon the side of the  Gauls, who slew her; the wolf turned towards the Romans, who let him go.  \"Comrades,\" cried a soldier, \"flight and death are on the side where you  see stretched on the ground the hind of Diana; the wolf belongs to Mars;  he is unwounded, and reminds us of our father and founder; we shall  conquer even as he.\"  Nevertheless the battle went badly for the Romans;  several legions were in flight, and Decius strove vainly to rally them.  The memory of his father came across his mind.  There was a belief  amongst the Romans that if in the midst of an unsuccessful engagement the  general devoted himself to the infernal gods, \"panic and flight\" passed  forthwith to the enemies' ranks.  \"Why daily?\" said Decius to the grand  pontiff, whom he had ordered to follow him and keep at his side in the  flight; \"'tis given to our race to die to avert public disasters.\"  He  halted, placed a javelin beneath his feet, and covering his head with a  fold of his robe, and supporting his chin on his right hand, repeated  after the pontiff this sacred form of words:--    \"Janus, Jupiter, our father Mars, Quirinus, Bellona, Lares, .  .  .  ye  gods in whose power are we, we and our enemies, gods Manes, ye I adore;  ye I pray, ye I adjure to give strength and victory to the Roman people,  the children of Quirinus, and to send confusion, panic, and death amongst  the enemies of the Roman people, the children of Quirinus.  And, in these  words for the republic of the children of Quirinus, for the army, for the  legions, and for the allies of the Roman people, I devote to the gods  Manes and to the grave the legions and the allies of the enemy and  myself.\"    Then remounting, Decius charged into the middle of the Gauls, where he  soon fell pierced with wounds; but the Romans recovered courage and  gained the day; for heroism and piety have power over the hearts of men,  so that at the moment of admiration they become capable of imitation.    During this second period Rome was more than once in danger.  In the year  283 B.C.  the Gauls destroyed one of her armies near Aretium (Arezzo),  and advanced to the Roman frontier, saying, \"We are bound for Rome; the  Gauls know how to take it.\"  Seventy-two years afterwards the Cisalpine  Gauls swore they would not put off their baldricks till they had mounted  the Capitol, and they arrived within three days' march of Rome.  At every  appearance of this formidable enemy the alarm at Rome was great.  The  senate raised all its forces and summoned its allies.  The people  demanded a consultation of the Sibylline books, sacred volumes sold, it  was said, to Tarquinius Priscus by the sibyl Amalthea, and containing the  secret of the destinies of the Republic.  They were actually"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11952"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 2 (#7)"],[1,"were dissolved in tears,\"  says he, \"in such sort they could not utter a single word; and, seeing  them so moved, those present wept in their turn for pity's sake.  'Weep  not,' said King Richard to them; 'I know what ye be come to ask; your  lord, the King of France, desireth to go home again, and ye be come in  his name to ask on his behalf my counsel and leave to get him gone.'  'It is true, sir; you know all,' answered the messengers; 'our king  sayeth, that if he depart not speedily from this land, he will surely  die.'  'It will be for him and for the kingdom of France,' replied King  Richard, 'eternal shame, if he go home without fulfilling the work for  the which he came, and he shall not go hence by my advice; but if he must  die or return home, let him do what he will, and what may appear to him  expedient for him, for him and his.'\"  The source from which this story  comes, and the tone of it, are enough to take from it all authority; for  it is the custom of monastic chroniclers to attribute to political or  military characters emotions and demonstrations alien to their position  and their times.  Philip Augustus, moreover, was one of the most decided,  most insensible to any other influence but that of his own mind, and most  disregardful of his enemies' bitter speeches, of all the kings in French  history.  He returned to France after the capture of St. Jean d' Acre,  because he considered the ultimate success of the crusade impossible, and  his return necessary for the interests of France and for his own.  He was  right in thus thinking and acting; and King Richard, when insultingly  reproaching him for it, did not foresee that, a year later, he would  himself be doing the same thing, and would give up the crusade without  having obtained anything more for Christendom, except fresh reverses.    [Illustration: RICHARD COEUR DE LION HAVING THE SARACENS BEHEADED.----7]    On the 31st of July, 1191, Philip, leaving with the army of the crusaders  ten thousand foot and five hundred knights, under the command of Duke  Hugh of Burgundy, who had orders to obey King Richard, set sail for  France; and, a few days after Christmas in the same year, landed in his  kingdom, and forth-with resumed, at Fontainebleau according to some, and  at Paris according to others, the regular direction of his government.  We shall see before long with what intelligent energy and with what  success he developed and consolidated the territorial greatness of France  and the influence of the kingship, to her security in Europe and her  prosperity at home.    From the 1st of August, 1191, to the 9th of October, 1192, King Richard  remained alone in the East as chief of the crusade and defender of  Christendom.  He pertains, during that period, to the history of England,  and no longer to that of France.  We will, however, recall a few facts to  show how fruitless, for the cause of Christendom in the East, was the  prolongation of his stay and what strange deeds--at one time of savage  barbarism, and at another of mad pride or fantastic knight-errantry--were  united in him with noble instincts and the most heroic courage.  On the  20th of August, 1191, five weeks after the surrender of St. Jean d'Acre,  he found that Saladin was not fulfilling with sufficient promptitude the  conditions of capitulation, and, to bring him up to time, he ordered the  decapitation, before the walls of the place, of, according to some,  twenty-five hundred, and, according to others, five thousand, Mussulman  prisoners remaining in his hands.    [Illustration: Richard Coeur de Lion having the Saracens beheaded.----37]    The only effect of this massacre was, that during Richard's first  campaign after Philip's departure for France, Saladin put to the sword  all the Christians taken in battle or caught straggling, and ordered  their bodies to be left without burial, as those of the garrison of St.  Jean d'Acre had been.  Some months afterwards Richard conceived the idea  of putting an end to the struggle between Christendom and Islamry, which  he was not succeeding in terminating by war, by a marriage.  He had a  sister, Joan of England, widow of William II., king of Sicily; and  Saladin had a brother, Malek-Adhel, a valiant warrior, respected by the  Christians.  Richard had proposals made to Saladin to unite them in  marriage and set them to reign together over the Christians and  Mussulmans in the kingdom of Jerusalem.  The only result of the  negotiation was to give Saladin time for repairing the fortifications of  Jerusalem, and to bring down upon King Richard and his sister, on the  part of the Christian bishops, the fiercest threats of the fulminations  of the Church.  With the exception of this ridiculous incident, Richard's  life, during the whole course of this year, was nothing but a series of  great or small battles, desperately contested, against Saladin.  When  Richard had obtained a success, he pursued it in a haughty, passionate  spirit; when he suffered a check, he offered Saladin peace, but always on  condition of surrendering Jerusalem to the Christians, and Saladin always  answered, \"Jerusalem never was yours, and we may not without sin give it  up to you; for it is the place where the mysteries of our religion were  accomplished, and the last one of my soldiers will perish before the  Mussulmans renounce conquests made in the name of Mahomet.\"  Twice  Richard and his army drew near Jerusalem, \"without his daring to look  upon it, he said, since he was not in a condition to take it.\"  At last,  in the summer of 1192, the two armies and the two chiefs began to be  weary of a war without result.  A great one, however, for Saladin and the  Mussulmans was the departure of Richard and the crusaders.  Being unable  to agree about conditions for a definitive peace, they contented  themselves, on both sides, with a truce for three years and eight months,  leaving Jerusalem in possession of the Mussulmans, but open for worship  to the Christians, in whose hands remained, at the same time, the towns  they were in occupation of on the maritime coast, from Jaffa to Tyre.  This truce, which was called peace, having received the signature of all  the Christian and Mussulman princes, was celebrated by galas and  tournaments, at which Christians and Mussulmans seemed for a moment to  have forgotten their hate; and on the 9th of October, 1192, Richard  embarked at St. Jean d'Acre to go and run other risks.    Thus ended the third crusade, undertaken by the three greatest sovereigns  and the three greatest armies of Christian Europe, and with the loudly  proclaimed object of retaking Jerusalem from the infidels, and  re-establishing a king over the sepulchre of Jesus Christ.  The Emperor  Frederick Barbarossa perished in it before he had trodden the soil of  Palestine.  King Philip Augustus retired from it voluntarily, so soon as  experience had foreshadowed to him the impossibility of success.  King  Richard abandoned it perforce, after having exhausted upon it his heroism  and his knightly pride.  The three armies, at the moment of departure  from Europe, amounted, according to the historians of the time, to five  or six hundred thousand men, of whom scarcely one hundred thousand  returned; and the only result of the third crusade was to leave as head  over all the most beautiful provinces of Mussulman Asia and Africa,  Saladin, the most illustrious and most able chieftain, in war and in  politics, that Islamry had produced since Mahomet.    From the end of the twelfth to the middle of the thirteenth century,  between the crusade of Philip Augustus and that of St. Louis, it is usual  to count three crusades, over which we will not linger.  Two of these  crusades--one, from 1195 to 1198, under Henry VI., Emperor of Germany,  and the other, from 1216 to 1240, under the Emperor Frederick II.  and  Andrew II., King of Hungary--are unconnected with France, and almost  exclusively German, or, in origin and range, confined to Eastern Europe.  They led, in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, to wars, negotiations, and  manifold complications; Jerusalem fell once more, for a while, into the  hands of the Christians; and there, on the 18th of March, 1229, in the  church of the Resurrection, the Emperor Frederick II., at that time  excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX., placed with his own hands the royal  crown upon his head.  But these events, confused, disconnected, and  short-lived as they were, did not produce in the West, and especially in  France, any considerable reverberation, and did not exercise upon the  relative situations of Europe and Asia, of Christendom and Islamry, any  really historical influence.  In people's lives, and in the affairs of  the world, there are many movements of no significance, and more cry than  wool; and those facts only which have had some weight and some duration  are here to be noted for study and comprehension.  The event which has  been called the fifth crusade was not wanting, so far, in real  importance, and it would have to be described here, if it had been really  a crusade; but it does not deserve the name.  The crusades were a very  different thing from wars and conquests; their real and peculiar  characteristic was, that they should be struggles between Christianity  and Islamism, between the fruitful civilization of Europe and the  barbarism and stagnation of Asia.  Therein consist their originality and  their grandeur.  It was certainly on this understanding, and with this  view, that Pope Innocent III., one of the greatest men of the thirteenth  century, seconded with all his might the movement which was at that time  springing up again in favor of a fresh crusade, and which brought about,  in 1202, an alliance between a great number of powerful lords, French,  Flemish, and Italian, and the republic of Venice, for the purpose of  recovering Jerusalem from the infidels.  But from the very first, the  ambition, "]]]
