My glasses were constantly clouding over with a fine coating of water  drops; exposed metal rusted overnight; the folds in garments accumulated  mildew in an astonishingly brief period of time. There was never even  the suggestion of chill in this dampness. It clung and enveloped like a  grateful garment; and seemed only to lack sweet perfume.    At this time, by good fortune, it happened that the moon came full. We  had enjoyed its waxing during our voyage down the Red Sea; but now it  had reached its greatest phase, and hung over the slumbering tropic  ocean like a lantern. The lazy sea stirred beneath it, and the ship  glided on, its lights fairly subdued by the splendour of the waters.  Under the awnings the ship's company lounged in lazy attitudes or  promenaded slowly, talking low voiced, cigars glowing in the splendid  dusk. Overside, in the furrow of the disturbed waters, the  phosphorescence flashed perpetually beneath the shadow of the ship.    The days passed by languidly and all alike. On the chart outside the  smoking-room door the procession of tiny German flags on pins marched  steadily, an inch at a time, towards the south. Otherwise we might as  well have imagined ourselves midgets afloat in a pond and getting  nowhere.    Somewhere north of the equator--before Father Neptune in ancient style  had come aboard and ducked the lot of us--we were treated to the  spectacle of how the German \"sheep\" reacts under a joke. Each nation has  its type of fool; and all, for the joyousness of mankind, differ. On the  bulletin board one evening appeared a notice to the effect that the  following morning a limited number of sportsmen would be permitted  ashore for the day. Each was advised to bring his own lunch, rifle, and  drinks. The reason alleged was that the ship must round a certain cape  across which the sportsmen could march afoot in sufficient time to  permit them a little shooting.    Now aboard ship were a dozen English, four Americans, and thirty or  forty Germans. The Americans and English looked upon that bulletin,  smiled gently, and went to order another round of lemon squashes. It was  a meek, mild, little joke enough; but surely the bulletin board was as  far as it could possibly go. Next morning, however, we observed a  half-dozen of our German friends in khaki and sun helmet, very busy with  lunch boxes, bottles of beer, rifles, and the like. They said they were  going ashore as per bulletin. We looked at each other and hied us to the  upper deck. There we found one of the boats slung overside, with our old  friend the quartermaster ostentatiously stowing kegs of water, boxes,  and the like.    \"When,\" we inquired gently, \"does the expedition start?\"    \"At ten o'clock,\" said he.    It was now within fifteen minutes of that hour.    We were at the time fully ten miles off shore, and forging ahead full  speed parallel with the coast.    We pointed out this fact to the quartermaster, but found, to our sorrow,  that the poor old man had suddenly gone deaf! We therefore refrained  from asking several other questions that had occurred to us--such as,  why the cape was not shown on the map.    \"Somebody,\" said one of the Americans, a cowboy going out second class  on the look for new cattle country, \"is a goat. It sure looks to me like  it was these yere steamboat people. They can't expect to rope nothing on  such a raw deal as this!\"    To which the English assented, though in different idiom.    But now up the companion ladder struggled eight serious-minded  individuals herded by the second mate. They were armed to the teeth, and  thoroughly equipped with things I had seen in German catalogues, but in  whose existence I had never believed. A half-dozen sailors eagerly  helped them with their multitudinous effects. Not a thought gave they to  the fact that we were ten miles off the coast, that we gave no  indication of slackening speed, that it would take the rest of the day  to row ashore, that there was no cape for us to round, that if there  were--oh! all the other hundred improbabilities peculiar to the  situation. Under direction of the mate they deposited their impedimenta  beneath a tarpaulin, and took their places in solemn rows amidships  across the thwarts of the boat slung overside. The importance of the  occasion sat upon them heavily; they were going ashore--in Africa--to  Slay Wild Beasts. They looked upon themselves as of bolder, sterner  stuff than the rest of us.    When the procession first appeared, our cowboy's face for a single  instant had flamed with amazed incredulity. Then a mask of  expressionless stolidity fell across his features, which in no line  thereafter varied one iota.    \"What are they going to do with them?\" murmured one of the Englishmen,  at a loss.    \"I reckon,\" said the cowboy, \"that they look on this as the easiest way  to drown them all to onct.\"    Then from behind one of the other boats suddenly appeared a huge German  sailor with a hose. The devoted imbeciles in the shore boat were  drenched as by a cloud-burst. Back and forth and up and down the heavy  stream played, while every other human being about the ship shrieked  with joy. Did the victims rise up in a body and capture that hose nozzle  and turn the stream to sweep the decks? Did they duck for shelter? Did  they at least know enough to scatter and run? They did none of these  things; but sat there in meek little rows like mannikins until the boat  was half full of water and everything awash. Then, when the sailor shut  off the stream, they continued to sit there until the mate came to order  them out. Why? I cannot tell you. Perhaps that is the German idea of how  to take a joke. Perhaps they were afraid worse things might be  consequent on resistance. Perhaps they still hoped to go ashore. One of  the Englishmen asked just that question.    \"What,\" he demanded disgustedly, \"what is the matter with the beggars?\"    Our cowboy may have had the correct solution. He stretched his long  legs and jumped down from the rail.    \"Nothing stirring above the ears,\" said he.    It is customary in books of travel to describe this part of the journey  somewhat as follows: \"Skirting the low and uninteresting shores of  Africa we at length reached,\" etc. Low and uninteresting shores! Through  the glasses we made out distant mountains far beyond nearer hills. The  latter were green-covered with dense forests whence rose mysterious  smokes. Along the shore we saw an occasional cocoanut plantation to the  water's edge and native huts and villages of thatch. Canoes of strange  models lay drawn up on shelving beaches; queer fish-pounds of brush  reached out considerable distances from the coast. The white surf  pounded on a yellow beach.    All about these things was the jungle, hemming in the plantations and  villages, bordering the lagoons, creeping down until it fairly overhung  the yellow beaches; as though, conqueror through all the country beyond,  it were half-inclined to dispute dominion with old Ocean himself. It  looked from the distance like a thick, soft coverlet thrown down over  the country; following--or, rather, suggesting--the inequalities.  Through the glasses we were occasionally able to peep under the edge of  this coverlet, and see where the fringe of the jungle drew back in a  little pocket, or to catch the sheen of mysterious dark rivers slipping  to the sea. Up these dark rivers, by way of the entrances of these tiny  pockets, the imagination then could lead on into the dimness beneath the  sunlit upper surfaces.    Towards the close of one afternoon we changed our course slightly, and  swung in on a long slant towards the coast. We did it casually; too  casually for so very important an action, for now at last we were about  to touch the mysterious continent. Then we saw clearer the fine, big  groves of palm and the luxuriance of the tropical vegetation. Against  the greenery, bold and white, shone the buildings of Mombasa; and after  a little while we saw an inland glitter that represented her narrow,  deep bay, the stern of a wreck against the low, green cliffs, and  strange, fat-trunked squat trees without leaves. Straight past all this  we glided at half speed, then turned sharp to the right to enter a long  wide expanse like a river, with green banks, twenty feet or so in  height, grown thickly with the tall cocoanut palms. These gave way at  times into broad, low lagoons, at the end of which were small beaches  and boats, and native huts among more cocoanut groves. Through our  glasses we could see the black men watching us, quite motionless,  squatted on their heels.    It was like suddenly entering another world, this gliding from the open  sea straight into the heart of a green land. The ceaseless wash of waves  we had left outside with the ocean; our engines had fallen silent.  Across the hushed waters came to us strange chantings and the beating of  a tom-tom, an occasional shrill shout from the unknown jungle. The sun  was just set, and the tops of the palms caught the last rays; all below  was dense green shadow. Across the surface of the water glided dug-out  canoes of shapes strange to us. We passed ancient ruins almost  completely dismantled, their stones half smothered in green rank growth.  The wide river-like bay stretched on before us as far as the waning  light permitted us to see; finally losing itself in the heart of  mystery.    Steadily and confidently our ship steamed forward, until at last, when  we seemed to be afloat in a land-locked lake, we dropped anchor and came  to rest.    Darkness fell utterly before the usual quarantine regulations had been  carried through. Active and efficient agents had already taken charge  of our affairs, so we had only to wait idly by the rail until summoned.  Then we jostled our way down the long gangway, passed and repassed by  natives carrying baggage or returning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14460"],[0,"Faust: a Tragedy [part 1], Translated from the German of Goethe (#7)"],[1,"chamber, nightly,  The friendly lamp begins to burn,  Then in the bosom thought beams brightly,  Homeward the heart will then return.  Reason once more bids passion ponder,  Hope blooms again and smiles on man;  Back to life's rills he yearns to wander,  Ah! to the source where life began.    Stop growling, poodle! In the music Elysian  That laps my soul at this holy hour,  These bestial noises have jarring power.  We know that men will treat with derision  Whatever they cannot understand,  At goodness and truth and beauty's vision  Will shut their eyes and murmur and howl at it;  And must the dog, too, snarl and growl at it?    But ah, with the best will, I feel already,  No peace will well up in me, clear and steady.  But why must hope so soon deceive us,  And the dried-up stream in fever leave us?  For in this I have had a full probation.  And yet for this want a supply is provided,  To a higher than earth the soul is guided,  We are ready and yearn for revelation:  And where are its light and warmth so blent  As here in the New Testament?  I feel, this moment, a mighty yearning  To expound for once the ground text of all,  The venerable original  Into my own loved German honestly turning.          [_He opens the volume, and applies himself to the task_.]  \"In the beginning was the _Word_.\" I read.  But here I stick! Who helps me to proceed?  The _Word_--so high I cannot--dare not, rate it,  I must, then, otherwise translate it,  If by the spirit I am rightly taught.  It reads: \"In the beginning was the _thought_.\"  But study well this first line's lesson,  Nor let thy pen to error overhasten!  Is it the _thought_ does all from time's first hour?  \"In the beginning,\" read then, \"was the _power_.\"  Yet even while I write it down, my finger  Is checked, a voice forbids me there to linger.  The spirit helps! At once I dare to read  And write: \"In the beginning was the _deed_.\"    If I with thee must share my chamber,  Poodle, now, remember,  No more howling,  No more growling!  I had as lief a bull should bellow,  As have for a chum such a noisy fellow.  Stop that yell, now,  One of us must quit this cell now!  'Tis hard to retract hospitality,  But the door is open, thy way is free.  But what ails the creature?  Is this in the course of nature?  Is it real? or one of Fancy's shows?    How long and broad my poodle grows!  He rises from the ground;  That is no longer the form of a hound!  Heaven avert the curse from us!  He looks like a hippopotamus,  With his fiery eyes and the terrible white  Of his grinning teeth! oh what a fright  Have I brought with me into the house! Ah now,  No mystery art thou!  Methinks for such half hellish brood  The key of Solomon were good.    _Spirits_ [_in the passage_]. Softly! a fellow is caught there!    Keep back, all of you, follow him not there!    Like the fox in the trap,    Mourns the old hell-lynx his mishap.    But give ye good heed!    This way hover, that way hover,    Over and over,    And he shall right soon be freed.    Help can you give him,    O do not leave him!    Many good turns he's done us,    Many a fortune won us.    _Faust_. First, to encounter the creature  By the spell of the Four, says the teacher:      Salamander shall glisten,[12]      Undina lapse lightly,      Sylph vanish brightly,      Kobold quick listen.    He to whom Nature  Shows not, as teacher,  Every force  And secret source,  Over the spirits  No power inherits.        Vanish in glowing      Flame, Salamander!      Inward, spirally flowing,      Gurgle, Undine!      Gleam in meteoric splendor,      Airy Queen!      Thy homely help render,      Incubus! Incubus!      Forth and end the charm for us!    No kingdom of Nature  Resides in the creature.  He lies there grinning--'tis clear, my charm  Has done the monster no mite of harm.  I'll try, for thy curing,  Stronger adjuring.        Art thou a jail-bird,      A runaway hell-bird?      This sign,[13] then--adore it!      They tremble before it      All through the dark dwelling.    His hair is bristling--his body swelling.        Reprobate creature!      Canst read his nature?      The Uncreated,      Ineffably Holy,      With Deity mated,      Sin's victim lowly?    Driven behind the stove by my spells,  Like an elephant he swells;  He fills the whole room, so huge he's grown,  He waxes shadowy faster and faster.  Rise not up to the ceiling--down!  Lay thyself at the feet of thy master!  Thou seest, there's reason to dread my ire.  I'll scorch thee with the holy fire!  Wait not for the sight  Of the thrice-glowing light!  Wait not to feel the might  Of the potentest spell in all my treasure!              MEPHISTOPHELES.      [_As the mist sinks, steps forth from behind the stove,      dressed as a travelling scholasticus_.]  Why all this noise? What is your worship's pleasure?    _Faust_. This was the poodle's essence then!  A travelling clark? Ha! ha! The casus is too funny.    _Mephistopheles_. I bow to the most learned among men!  'Faith you did sweat me without ceremony.    _Faust_. What is thy name?    _Mephistopheles_. The question seems too small  For one who holds the _word_ so very cheaply,  Who, far removed from shadows all,  For substances alone seeks deeply.    _Faust_. With gentlemen like him in my presence,  The name is apt to express the essence,  Especially if, when you inquire,  You find it God of flies,[14] Destroyer, Slanderer, Liar.  Well now, who art thou then?    _Mephistopheles_. A portion of that power,  Which wills the bad and works the good at every hour.    _Faust_. Beneath thy riddle-word what meaning lies?    _Mephistopheles_. I am the spirit that denies!  And justly so; for all that time creates,  He does well who annihilates!  Better, it ne'er had had beginning;  And so, then, all that you call sinning,  Destruction,--all you pronounce ill-meant,--  Is my original element.    _Faust_. Thou call'st thyself a part, yet lookst complete to me.    _Mephistopheles_. I speak the modest truth to thee.  A world of folly in one little soul,  _Man_ loves to think himself a whole;  Part of the part am I, which once was all, the Gloom  That brought forth Light itself from out her mighty womb,  The upstart proud, that now with mother Night  Disputes her ancient rank and space and right,  Yet never shall prevail, since, do whate'er he will,  He cleaves, a slave, to bodies still;  From bodies flows, makes bodies fair to sight;  A body in his course can check him,  His doom, I therefore hope, will soon o'ertake him,  With bodies merged in nothingness and night.    _Faust_. Ah, now I see thy high vocation!  In gross thou canst not harm creation,  And so in small hast now begun.    _Mephistopheles_. And, truth to tell, e'en here, not much have done.  That which at nothing the gauntlet has hurled,  This, what's its name? this clumsy world,  So far as I have undertaken,  I have to own, remains unshaken  By wave, storm, earthquake, fiery brand.  Calm, after all, remain both sea and land.  And the damn'd living fluff, of man and beast the brood,  It laughs to scorn my utmost power.  I've buried myriads by the hour,  And still there circulates each hour a new, fresh blood.  It were enough to drive one to distraction!  Earth, water, air, in constant action,  Through moist and dry, through warm and cold,  Going forth in endless germination!  Had I not claimed of fire a reservation,  Not one thing I alone should hold.    _Faust_. Thus, with the ever-working power  Of good dost thou in strife persist,  And in vain malice, to this hour,  Clenchest thy cold and devilish fist!  Go try some other occupation,  Singular son of Chaos, thou!    _Mephistopheles_. We'll give the thing consideration,  When next we meet again! But now  Might I for once, with leave retire?    _Faust_. Why thou shouldst ask I do not see.  Now that I know thee, when desire  Shall prompt thee, freely visit me.  Window and door give free admission.  At least there's left the chimney flue.    _Mephistopheles_. Let me confess there's one small prohibition    Lies on thy threshold, 'gainst my walking through,  The wizard-foot--[15]    _Faust_.  Does that delay thee?  The Pentagram disturbs thee? Now,  Come tell me, son of hell, I pray thee,  If that spell-binds thee, then how enteredst thou?  _Thou_ shouldst proceed more circumspectly!    _Mephistopheles_. Mark well! the figure is not drawn correctly;  One of the angles, 'tis the outer one,  Is somewhat open, dost perceive it?    _Faust_. That was a lucky hit, believe it!  And I have caught thee then? Well done!  'Twas wholly chance--I'm quite astounded!    _Mephistopheles_.  The _poodle_ took no heed,  as through the door he bounded;  The case looks differently now;  The _devil_ can leave the house no-how.    _Faust_. The window offers free emission.    _Mephistopheles_. Devils and ghosts are bound by this condition:    The way they entered in, they must come out. Allow  In the first clause we're free, yet not so in the second.    _Faust_. In hell itself, then, laws are reckoned?  Now that I like; so then, one may, in fact,  Conclude a binding compact with you gentry?    _Mephistopheles_. Whatever promise on our books finds entry,  We strictly carry into act.  But hereby hangs a grave condition,  Of this we'll talk when next we meet;  But for the present I entreat  Most urgently your kind dismission.    _Faust_. Do stay but just one moment longer, then,  Tell me good news and I'll release thee.    _Mephistopheles_. Let me go now! I'll soon come back again,  Then may'st thou ask whate'er shall please thee.    _Faust_. I laid no snare for thee, old chap!  Thou shouldst have watched and saved thy bacon.  Who has the devil in his trap  Must hold him fast, next time he'll not so soon be taken.    _Mephistopheles_. Well, if it please thee, I'm content to stay  For company, on one condition,  That I, for thy amusement, may  To exercise my arts have free permission.    _Faust_. I gladly grant it, if they be  Not"]]]
