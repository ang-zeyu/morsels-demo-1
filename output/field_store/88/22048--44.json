Of sodium  and potassium hydroxide, it may be said that they can be used with all  indicators, and their solutions may be boiled, but they absorb carbon  dioxide readily and attack the glass of bottles, thereby losing  strength; sodium carbonate may be weighed directly if its purity is  assured, but the presence of carbonic acid from the carbonate is a  disadvantage with many indicators; barium hydroxide solutions may  be prepared which are entirely free from carbon dioxide, and such  solutions immediately show by precipitation any contamination from  absorption, but the hydroxide is not freely soluble in water; ammonia  does not absorb carbon dioxide as readily as the caustic alkalies,  but its solutions cannot be boiled nor can they be used with all  indicators. The choice of a solution must depend upon the nature of  the work in hand.    A !normal acid solution! should contain in one liter that quantity of  the reagent which represents 1 gram of hydrogen replaceable by a base.  For example, the normal solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) should  contain 36.46 grams of gaseous hydrogen chloride, since that amount  furnishes the requisite 1 gram of replaceable hydrogen. On the other  hand, the normal solution of sulphuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}) should  contain only 49.03 grams, i.e., one half of its molecular weight in  grams.    A !normal alkali solution! should contain sufficient alkali in a liter  to replace 1 gram of hydrogen in an acid. This quantity is represented  by the molecular weight in grams (40.01) of sodium hydroxide (NaOH),  while a sodium carbonate solution (Na_{2}CO_{3}) should contain but  one half the molecular weight in grams (i.e., 53.0 grams) in a liter  of normal solution.    Half-normal or tenth-normal solutions are employed in most analyses  (except in the case of the less soluble barium hydroxide). Solutions  of the latter strength yield more accurate results when small  percentages of acid or alkali are to be determined.      INDICATORS    It has already been pointed out that the purpose of an indicator is to  mark (usually by a change of color) the point at which just enough of  the titrating solution has been added to complete the chemical change  which it is intended to bring about. In the neutralization processes  which are employed in the measurement of alkalies (!alkalimetry!)  or acids (!acidimetry!) the end-point of the reaction should, in  principle, be that of complete neutrality. Expressed in terms of ionic  reactions, it should be the point at which the H^{+} ions from an  acid[Note 1] unite with a corresponding number of OH^{-} ions from a  base to form water molecules, as in the equation    H^{+}, Cl^{-} + Na^{+}, OH^{-} --> Na^{+}, Cl^{-} + (H_{2}O).    It is not usually possible to realize this condition of exact  neutrality, but it is possible to approach it with sufficient  exactness for analytical purposes, since substances are known which,  in solution, undergo a sharp change of color as soon as even a minute  excess of H^{+} or OH^{-} ions are present. Some, as will be seen,  react sharply in the presence of H^{+} ions, and others with OH^{-}  ions. These substances employed as indicators are usually organic  compounds of complex structure and are closely allied to the dyestuffs  in character.    [Note 1: A knowledge on the part of the student of the ionic theory  as applied to aqueous solutions of electrolytes is assumed. A brief  outline of the more important applications of the theory is given in  the Appendix.]      BEHAVIOR OF ORGANIC INDICATORS    The indicators in most common use for acid and alkali titrations are  methyl orange, litmus, and phenolphthalein.    In the following discussion of the principles underlying the behavior  of the indicators as a class, methyl orange and phenolphthalein will  be taken as types. It has just been pointed out that indicators are  bodies of complicated structure. In the case of the two indicators  named, the changes which they undergo have been carefully studied by  Stieglitz (!J. Am. Chem. Soc.!, 25, 1112) and others, and it appears  that the changes involved are of two sorts: First, a rearrangement  of the atoms within the molecule, such as often occurs in organic  compounds; and, second, ionic changes. The intermolecular changes  cannot appropriately be discussed here, as they involve a somewhat  detailed knowledge of the classification and general behavior of  organic compounds; they will, therefore, be merely alluded to, and  only the ionic changes followed.    Methyl orange is a representative of the group of indicators which,  in aqueous solutions, behave as weak bases. The yellow color which it  imparts to solutions is ascribed to the presence of the undissociated  base. If an acid, such as HCl, is added to such a solution, the acid  reacts with the indicator (neutralizes it) and a salt is formed, as  indicated by the equation:    (M.o.)^{+}, OH^{-} + H^{+}, Cl^{-} --> (M.o.)^{+} Cl^{-} + (H_{2}O).    This salt ionizes into (M.o.)^{+} (using this abbreviation for the  positive complex) and Cl^{-}; but simultaneously with this ionization  there appears to be an internal rearrangement of the atoms which  results in the production of a cation which may be designated as  (M'.o'.)^{+}, and it is this which imparts a characteristic red color  to the solution. As these changes occur in the presence of even a  very small excess of acid (that is, of H^{+} ions), it serves as the  desired index of their presence in the solution. If, now, an alkali,  such as NaOH, is added to this reddened solution, the reverse  series of changes takes place. As soon as the free acid present is  neutralized, the slightest excess of sodium hydroxide, acting as  a strong base, sets free the weak, little-dissociated base of the  indicator, and at the moment of its formation it reverts, because of  the rearrangement of the atoms, to the yellow form:    OH^{-} + (M'.o'.)^{+} --> [M'.o'.OH] --> [M.o.OH].    Phenolphthalein, on the other hand, is a very weak, little-dissociated  acid, which is colorless in neutral aqueous solution or in the  presence of free H^{+} ions. When an alkali is added to such a  solution, even in slight excess, the anion of the salt which has  formed from the acid of the indicator undergoes a rearrangement of the  atoms, and a new ion, (Ph')^{+}, is formed, which imparts a pink color  to the solution:    H^{+}, (Ph)^{-} + Na^{+}, OH^{-} --> (H_{2}O) + Na^{+}, (Ph)^{-}  --> Na^{+}, (Ph')^{-}    The addition of the slightest excess of an acid to this solution, on  the other hand, occasions first the reversion to the colorless ion and  then the setting free of the undissociated acid of the indicator:    H^{+}, (Ph')^{-} --> H^{+}, (Ph)^{-} --> (HPh).    Of the common indicators methyl orange is the most sensitive toward  alkalies and phenolphthalein toward acids; the others occupy  intermediate positions. That methyl orange should be most sensitive  toward alkalies is evident from the following considerations: Methyl  orange is a weak base and, therefore, but little dissociated. It  should, then, be formed in the undissociated condition as soon as even  a slight excess of OH^{-} ions is present in the solution, and there  should be a prompt change from red to yellow as outlined above. On the  other hand, it should be an unsatisfactory indicator for use with weak  acids (acetic acid, for example) because the salts which it forms  with such acids are, like all salts of that type, hydrolyzed to a  considerable extent. This hydrolytic change is illustrated by the  equation:    (M.o.)^{+} C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}^{-} + H^{+}, OH^{-} --> [M.o.OH] + H^{+},  C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}^{-}.    Comparison of this equation with that on page 30 will make it plain  that hydrolysis is just the reverse of neutralization and must,  accordingly, interfere with it. Salts of methyl orange with weak acids  are so far hydrolyzed that the end-point is uncertain, and methyl  orange cannot be used in the titration of such acids, while with  the very weak acids, such as carbonic acid or hydrogen sulphide  (hydrosulphuric acid), the salts formed with methyl orange are, in  effect, completely hydrolyzed (i.e., no neutralization occurs), and  methyl orange is accordingly scarcely affected by these acids. This  explains its usefulness, as referred to later, for the titration of  strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid, even in the presence of  carbonates or sulphides in solution.    Phenolphthalein, on the other hand, should be, as it is, the best of  the common indicators for use with weak acids. For, since it is  itself a weak acid, it is very little dissociated, and its nearly  undissociated, colorless molecules are promptly formed as soon as  there is any free acid (that is, free H^{+} ions) in the solution.  This indicator cannot, however, be successfully used with weak bases,  even ammonium hydroxide; for, since it is weak acid, the salts  which it forms with weak alkalies are easily hydrolyzed, and as a  consequence of this hydrolysis the change of color is not sharp.  This indicator can, however, be successfully used with strong bases,  because the salts which it forms with such bases are much less  hydrolyzed and because the excess of OH^{-} ions from these bases also  diminishes the hydrolytic action of water.    This indicator is affected by even so weak an acid as carbonic acid,  which must be removed by boiling the solution before titration. It is  the indicator most generally employed for the titration of organic  acids.    In general, it may be stated that when a strong acid, such as  hydrochloric, sulphuric or nitric acid, is titrated against a strong  base, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or barium  hydroxide, any of these indicators may be used, since very little  hydrolysis ensues. It has been noted above that the color change does  not occur exactly at theoretical neutrality, from which it follows  that no two indicators will"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1279"],[0,"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns (#7)"],[1,"his blood,       'Twill make your courage rise.

The sky was blue, the wind was still,       The moon was shining clearly;       I set her down, wi' right good will,       Amang the rigs o' barley:       I ken't her heart was a' my ain;       I lov'd her most sincerely;         I kiss'd her owre and owre again,       Amang the rigs o' barley.
