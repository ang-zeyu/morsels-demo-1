What seems a miracle, and in contravention of law, is only the  constitutional exercise of higher force over forces organized to  be swayed. If law were perfectly rigid, there could be but one  force; but many grades exist from cohesion to mind and spirit.  The highest forces are meant to have victory, and thus give the  highest order and perfectness.    Across the astronomic spaces reach all these powers, making creation  a perpetual process rather than a single act. It almost seems as  if light, in its varied capacities, were the embodiment of God's  creative power; as if, having said, \"Let there be light,\" he need do  nothing else, but allow it to carry forward the creative processes  to the end of time. It was Newton, one of the earliest and most  acute investigators in this study of light, who said, \"I seem to  have wandered on the shore of Truth's great ocean, and to have  gathered a few pebbles more beautiful than common; but the vast  ocean itself rolls before me undiscovered and unexplored.\"    [Page 37]  EXPERIMENTS WITH LIGHT.    A light set in a room is seen from every place; hence light streams  in every possible direction. If put in the centre of a hollow sphere,  every point of the surface will be equally illumined. If put in  a sphere of twice the diameter, the same light will fall on all  the larger surface. The surfaces of spheres are as the squares  of their diameters; hence, in the larger sphere the surface is  illumined only one-quarter as much as the smaller. The same is true  of large and small rooms. In Fig. 7 it is apparent that the light  that falls on the first square is spread, at twice the distance,  over the second square, which is four times as large, and at three  times the distance over nine times the surface. The varying amount  of light received by each planet is also shown in fractions above  each world, the amount received by the earth being 1.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Measuring Intensities of Light.]    The intensity of light is easily measured. Let two lights of different  brightness, as in Fig. 8, cast shadows on the same screen. Arrange  them as to distance so that both shadows shall be equally dark.  Let them fall side by side, and study them carefully. Measure the  respective distances. Suppose one is twenty inches, the other forty.  Light varies as the square [Page 38] of the distance: the square of  20 is 400, of 40 is 1600. Divide 1600 by 400, and the result is that  one light is four times as bright as the other.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Reflection and Diffusion of Light.]    Light can be handled, directed, and bent, as well as iron bars.  Darken a room and admit a beam of sunlight through a shutter, or  a ray of lamp-light through the key-hole. If there is dust in the  room it will be observed that light goes in straight lines. Because  of this men are able to arrange houses and trees in rows, the hunter  aims his rifle correctly, and the astronomer projects straight  lines to infinity. Take a hand-mirror, or better, a piece of glass  coated on one side with black varnish, and you can send your ray  anywhere. By using two mirrors, or having an assistant and using  several, you can cause a ray of light to turn as many corners as you  please. I once saw Mr. Tyndall send a ray into a glass jar filled  with smoke (Fig. 9). Admitting a slender ray through a small hole in  a card over the mouth, one ray appeared; removing the cover, the  whole jar was luminous; as the smoke disappeared in spots cavities  of darkness appeared. Turn the same ray into a tumbler of water,  [Page 39]  it becomes faintly visible; stir into it a teaspoonful of milk, then  turn in the ray of sunlight, and it glows like a lamp, illuminating  the whole room. These experiments show how the straight rays of  the sun are diffused in every direction over the earth.    Set a small light near one edge of a mirror; then, by putting the  eye near the opposite edge, you see almost as many flames as you  please from the multiplied reflections. How can this be accounted  for?    Into your beam of sunlight, admitted through a half-inch hole,  put the mirror at an oblique angle; you can arrange it so as to  throw half a dozen bright spots on the opposite wall.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Manifold Reflections.]    In Fig. 10 the sunbeam enters at A, and, striking the mirror _m_  at _a_, is partly reflected to 1 on the wall, and partly enters  the glass, passes through to the silvered back at B, and is totally  reflected to _b_, where it again divides, some of it going to the  wall at 2, and the rest, continuing to make the same reflections  and divisions, causes spots 3, 4, 5, etc. The brightest spot is  at No.2, because the silvered glass at B is the best reflector  and has the most light.    When the discovery of the moons of Mars was announced in 1877,  it was also widely published that they could be seen by a mirror.  Of course this is impossible. The point of light mistaken for the  moon in this secondary reflection was caused by holding the mirror  in an oblique position.    Take a small piece of mirror, say an inch in surface, and putting  under it three little pellets of wax, putty, or clay, set it on  the wrist, with one of the pellets on the pulse. Hold the mirror  steadily in the beam of light, and the frequency and prominence of  each pulse-beat will be indicated by the tossing spot of light on  the wall. If the operator becomes excited the fact will be evident  to all observers.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    Place a coin in a basin (Fig. 11), and set it so that the rim will  conceal the coin from the eye. Pour in water, and the coin will  [Page 40] appear to rise into sight. When light passes from a medium  of one density to a medium of another, its direction is changed.  Thus a stick in water seems bent. Ships below the horizon are  sometimes seen above, because of the different density of the layers  of air.    Thus light coming from the interstellar spaces, and entering our  atmosphere, is bent down more and more by its increasing density.  The effect is greatest when the sun or star is near the horizon,  none at all in the zenith. This brings the object into view before  it is risen. Allowance for this displacement is made in all delicate  astronomical observations.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Atmospherical Refraction.]    Notice on the floor the shadow of the window-frames. The glass  of almost every window is so bent as to turn the sunlight aside  enough to obliterate some of the shadows or increase their thickness.    DECOMPOSITION OF LIGHT.    Admit the sunbeam through a slit one inch long and one-twentieth  of an inch wide. Pass it through a prism. Either purchase one or  make it of three plain pieces of glass one and a half inch wide  by six inches long, fastened together in triangular shape--fasten  the edges with hot wax and fill it with water; then on a screen  or wall you will have the colors of the rainbow, not merely seven  but seventy, if your eyes are sharp enough.    Take a bit of red paper that matches the red color of the spectrum.  Move it along the line of colors toward the violet. In the orange  it is dark, in the yellow darker, in the green and all beyond,  black. That is because there are no more red rays to be reflected  by it. So a green object is true to its color only in the green  rays, and black elsewhere. All these colors may be recombined by  a second prism into white light.          [Page 41]  III.    ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.      \"The eyes of the Lord are in every place.\"--_Proverbs_ xv. 3.    [Page 42]  \"Man, having one kind of an eye given him by his Maker, proceeds  to construct two other kinds. He makes one that magnifies invisible  objects thousands of times, so that a dull razor-edge appears as  thick as three fingers, until the amazing beauty of color and form  in infinitesimal objects is entrancingly apparent, and he knows that  God's care of least things is infinite. Then he makes the other kind  four or six feet in diameter, and penetrates the immensities of space  thousands of times beyond where his natural eye can pierce, until he  sees that God's immensities of worlds are infinite also.\"--BISHOP  FOSTER.          [Page 43]  III.    _THE TELESCOPE._    Frequent allusion has been made in the previous chapter to discovered  results. It is necessary to understand more clearly the process by  which such results have been obtained. Some astronomical instruments  are of the simplest character, some most delicate and complex.  When a man smokes a piece of glass, in order to see an eclipse  of the sun, he makes a simple instrument. Ferguson, lying on his  back and slipping beads on a string at a certain distance above  his eye, measured the relative distances of the stars. The use  of more complex instruments commenced when Galileo applied the  telescope to the heavens. He cannot be said to have invented the  telescope, but he certainly constructed his own without a pattern,  and used it to good purpose. It consists of a lens, O B (Fig. 13),  which acts as a multiple prism to bend all the rays to one point  at R. Place the eye there, and it receives as much light as if it  were as large as the lens O B. The rays, however, are convergent,  and the point difficult to [Page 44] find. Hence there is placed at  R a concave lens, passing through which the rays emerge in parallel  lines, and are received by the eye. Opera-glasses are made upon  precisely this principle to-day, because they can be made  conveniently short.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Refracting Telescope.]    If, instead of a concave lens at R, converting the converging rays  into parallel ones, we place a convex or magnifying lens, the minute  image is enlarged as much as an object seems diminished when the  telescope is reversed. This is the grand principle of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15622"],[0,"Handbook on Japanning: 2nd Edition (#7)"],[1,"slight drawback is not felt quite so much. However, it seems a  good principle to leave every inch of internal space available for the  goods to be enamelled or japanned, This principle is carried out to  the letter in the other form of stoves described and illustrated in  the sequel.    The figure shows a section through single chamber japanning and  enamelling oven heated by hot-water pipes (steel) closed at both ends  and partially filled with water which always remains sealed up  therein, and never evaporates until the pipes require to be refilled.    This stove may be heated (1) by hot-water pipes (iron), (2) by  super-heated water, (3) by steam, but only to 80 deg. C. The different  compartments may be heated to uniform or to different temperatures  with hot water; the stoke-hole is at the side and thus quite separated  from the stove proper.    The ovens must be on the ground floor, so that the super-heated steam  from the basement may be available.    The great drawback to the use of gas for heating japanning and  enamelling stoves is the great cost of coal gas.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Portable Gas Heated Japanning and Enamelling  Stove fitted with Shelves, Thermometer, etc.]      PIGMENTS SUITABLE FOR JAPANNING WITH NATURAL LACQUER.    _White Pigments._--Barium sulphate and bismuth oxychloride. These two  are used for the white lacquer or as a body for coloured lacquers.  When the lacquer is to be dried at a high temperature barium sulphate  is preferable, but when it is dried at an ordinary temperature bismuth  oxychloride is better. Since the lacquer is originally of a brown  colour the white lacquer is not pure white, but rather greyish or  yellowish. Many white pigments, such as zinc oxide, zinc sulphide,  calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, calcium sulphate, lead white,  etc., turn brown to black, and no white lacquer can be obtained with  them.    _Red Pigments._--Vermilion and red oxide of iron. These two are used  for the red lacquer, but vermilion should be stoved at a low  temperature.    _Blue Pigment._--Prussian blue.    _Yellow Pigments._--Cadmium sulphide, lead chromate and orpiment.    _Green Pigment._--Chromium oxide (? Guignet's green).    _Black Pigment._--Lamp black. This is one of the pigments for black  lacquer, but does not give a brilliant colour, therefore it is better  to prepare the black lacquer by adding iron powder or some compound of  iron to the lacquer.    Various mixed colours are obtained by mixing some of the  above-mentioned pigments.    Examples of application are as follows:--    (1) _Golden Yellow._--Finished lacquer, 10 parts; gamboge, 1 to 3;  solvent, 5. If utensils are lacquered with this thin lacquer and dried  for about 2 hours in an air-oven at a temperature of 120 deg. C. a  beautiful hard coating of golden colour is obtained.    (2) _Black._--Black lacquer, 10 parts; solvent 2 to 4. Utensils  lacquered with this lacquer are dried for about an hour at 130 deg. to  140 deg. C.    (3) _Red._--Vermilion, 10 parts; finished lacquer, 4; solvent, 2. This  lacquer is dried for about an hour at 130 deg. to 140 deg. C.    (4) _Khaki or Dirty Yellow._--Barium sulphate, 100 parts; chromic  oxide, 3; finished lacquer, 20 to 25; solvent, 15. This lacquer is  dried for about half an hour at 160 deg. C.    (5) _Green._--Barium sulphate, 100 parts; chromic oxide, 20 to 50;  finished lacquer, 40 to 50; solvent, 20. This is dried for about 10  minutes at 160 deg. C.    (6) _Yellow._--Barium sulphate, 100 parts; lead chromate, 40; finished  lacquer, 40; solvent, 20. This is dried for about 15 minutes at 150 deg.  C.    Almost all pigments other than the above-mentioned are blackened by  contact with lacquer or suspend its drying quality.    Several organic lakes can be used for coloured lacquers, that is to  say, Indian yellow, thioflavin, and auramine lake for a yellow  lacquer; fuchsine, rhodamine, and chloranisidin lake for a red;  diamond sky blue, and patent nileblue lake for a blue; acid green,  diamond green, brilliant milling green, vert-methyl lake, etc., for a  green; methyl violet, acid violet, and magenta lake for a violet;  phloxine lake for a pink. These lakes, however, are decomposed more or  less on heating and fail to give proper colours when dried at a high  temperature.      MODERN METHODS OF JAPANNING AND ENAMELLING WITH NATURAL JAPANESE  LACQUER.    Urushiol, the principal constituent of Japanese lacquer, does not  according to the Japanese investigator, Kisaburo Miryama, dry by  itself at ordinary temperatures, but can be dried with ease at a  temperature above 96 deg. C. In the same way, lacquer that has been  heated to a temperature above 70 deg. C. and has entirely lost its drying  quality can be easily dried at a high temperature. In this method of  japanning the higher the temperature is, the more rapidly does the  drying take place; for instance, a thin layer of urushiol, or lacquer,  hardens within 5 hours at 100 deg. C., within 30 minutes at 150 deg. C., and  within 10 minutes at 180 deg. C. Japanning at a high temperature with  natural lacquer does not require the presence of the enzymic  nitrogenous matter in the lacquer, and gives a transparent coating  which is quite hard and resistant to chemical and mechanical action;  in these respects it is distinguished from that dried at an ordinary  temperature. During the drying, oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere  and at the same time a partial decomposition takes place.    This method of japanning has its application in lacquering metal work,  glass, porcelain, earthenware, canvas, papier-mache, etc.; because the  drying is affected in a short time, and the coating thus obtained is  much more durable than the same obtained by the ordinary method.    For practical purposes it is better to _thin the lacquer with  turpentine oil or other solvent_ in order to facilitate the lacquering  and lessen the drying time of the lacquer. Since the lacquer-coating  turns brown at a high temperature, lacquers of a light colour should  be dried at 120 deg. to 150 deg. C.; and even those of a deep colour must not  be heated above 180 deg. C. _Most pigments are blackened by lacquer;  therefore the varieties of coloured lacquers are very limited._    FOOTNOTES:    [1] A question has been raised concerning the safety of  Perkins' apparatus, not merely as relates to the danger of explosion,  but also respecting that of high temperature; and it has been asserted  that the water may be so highly heated in the tubes as to endanger the  charring and even inflammation of paper, wood, and other substances in  their contact or vicinity: such no doubt might be the case in an  apparatus expressly intended for such purposes, but in the apparatus  as constructed by Perkins, with adequate dampers and safety valves,  and used with common care, no such result can ensue. Paper bound round  an iron tube is not affected till the temperature exceeds 400 deg.; from  420 deg. to 444 deg. it becomes brown or slightly singed; sulphur does not  inflame below 540 deg..          SECTION V.    COLOURS FOR POLISHED BRASS--MISCELLANEOUS.      PAINTING ON ZINC OR ON GALVANIZED IRON.    Painting on zinc or galvanized iron is facilitated by employing a  mordant of 1 quart of chloride of copper, 1 of nitrate of copper, and  1 of sal-ammoniac, dissolved in 64 parts of water. To thin mixture add  1 part of commercial hydrochloric acid. This is brushed over the zinc,  and dries a dull-grey colour in from twelve to twenty-four hours,  paint adhering perfectly to the surface thus formed.      BRONZING COMPOSITIONS.    The following are the formulae for a variety of baths, designed to  impart to polished brass various colours. The brass objects are put  into boiling solutions composed of different salts, and the intensity  of the shade obtained is dependent upon duration of the immersion.  With a solution composed of sulphate of copper, 120 grains;  hydrochlorate of ammonia, 30 grains; and water 1 quart, greenish  shades are obtained. With the following solution, all the shades of  brown, from orange-brown to cinnamon, are obtained: chlorate of  potash, 150 grains; sulphate of copper, 150 grains; and water, 1  quart. The following solution gives the brass first a rosy tint, and  then colours it violet and blue: sulphate of copper, 435 grains;  hyposulphite of soda, 300 grains; cream of tartar, 150 grains; and  water, 1 pint. Upon adding to this solution ammoniacal sulphate of  iron, 300 grains, and hyposulphite of soda, 300 grains, there are  obtained, according to the duration of the immersion, yellowish,  orange, rosy, and then bluish shades. Upon polarizing the ebullition,  the blue tint gives way to yellow, and finally to a pretty grey.  Silver, under the same circumstances, becomes very beautifully  coloured. After a long ebullition in the following solution, we obtain  a yellow-brown shade, and then a remarkable fire-red: chlorate of  potash, 75 grains; carbonate of nickel, 30 grains; salt of nickel, 75  grains; and water, 10 oz. The following solution gives a beautiful  dark-brown colour: chlorate of potash, 75 grains; salt of nickel, 150  grains; and water, 10 oz. The following gives in the first place, a  red, which passes to blue, then to pale lilac, and finally to white:  orpiment, 75 grains; crystallized sal-sodae, 150 grains; and water, 10  oz. The following gives a yellow-brown: salt of nickel, 75 grains;  sulphate of copper, 75 grains; chlorate of potash, 75 grains; and  water, 10 oz. On mixing the following solutions, sulphur separates,  and the brass becomes covered with iridescent crystallizations: (1)  cream of tartar, 75 grains; sulphate of copper, 75 grains; and water,  10 oz. (2) Hyposulphite of soda, 225 grains; and water, 5 oz. Upon  leaving the brass objects immersed in the following mixture, contained  in corked vessels, they at length acquire a very beautiful blue  colour: hepar of sulphur, 75 grains; ammonia, 75"]]]
