Jealousy, especially from the female side, is an ever-present source of  trouble and unhappiness among the Natives. The length to which a jealous  Native wife will go in winning back the affections of an errant husband  is often extraordinary, though the ways and means she adopts differ but  little from those practised by the superstitious and credulous peasantry  in Europe less than a hundred years ago.    While no one will deny the African Native a capacity for feeling anger  equal to that of the white man when provoked by insult and injury there  are many who believe that he is constitutionally incapable of sustaining  that feeling of hatred which in the European so often leads to  premeditated and prepared revenge. This notion is, no doubt, derivable  from the fact that a Native seldom shows any open vindictiveness against  a European employer by whom he has been insulted or unjustly punished,  but this fact may, I think, be otherwise accounted for. The white man's  prestige, backed up as it is by the established powers of law and order,  makes the attempt at revenge by a Native a difficult and risky  undertaking and, furthermore, there is to be considered the spirit of  traditional submissiveness which at all times and in all places marks  the attitude of the slave or serf towards his master. One has only to  remember the many accounts of abject resignation by the peasants of  France and the moujiks of Russia before the revolutions that changed the  order of the past in those countries. No such considerations affect the  Native where his anger and hatred are directed against one or more of  his own colour. The records of the South African courts are replete with  instances of cattle-maiming, arson, poisoning and other crimes proved to  have been motived solely by feelings of revenge.    Courage and fear are feelings that depend upon conditions that seem to  be fairly evenly distributed all over the world, and where the virtue of  courage in the form of pugnacity is comparatively lacking, as amongst  the bulk of the population of India, other forms thereof are met with,  such as that wonderful contempt of a painful death by burning which was  so often displayed by the widows of that country in following their  ancient custom of _suttee_. The average white man feels assured that no  race can be compared in bravery with his own, and that within that race  no nation can be found equal in courage to the one to which he belongs.  This is a form of elemental patriotism common to all communities, but  those who have shared the dangers of flood and field with African  Natives often testify to acts of sublime courage by Native soldiers,  hunters and miners in the face of real and appreciated danger under  circumstances which show that the Natives as a whole are no less capable  than the white people of conquering instinctive fear and of sacrificing  the individual self when great demands are made. I am not speaking now  of what is commonly called mob-courage. Natives have been known to go  through fire and water alone as well as white men.    Is there any difference of kind or degree in the moral sense of the two  races? In the prevailing view of authoritative students morality is  emotional and not intellectual in its origin, and the warrant of right  doing is attributed not to some hypothetical objective standard, but to  the whisperings of an inner conscience, an innate subjective mental  state, independent of environment and education. Differences,  undoubtedly, exist as to the acts or omissions which are approved or  disapproved by the moral feeling in the two races respectively, but the  feeling is the same. The feelings which prompt a Native woman to condemn  barrenness in other women is the same as that which makes the average  European lady look upon immodesty as a sign of immorality. The  difference is objective, not subjective; it is in the outlook but not in  the inner sense. That immorality is rife amongst Natives no one who  knows them well will deny, but neither can putanism amongst the whites  be denied. Before the white man came the very robust moral sense of the  Natives made them put down theft and, sometimes, adultery, with a  thoroughness which is apparently impossible amongst the most civilised  white people to-day. Now that Western civilisation is spreading over the  land the difference in the moral outlook of the two peoples tends to  decrease; with the savage vices go the savage virtues, and soon there  will be no difference at all.    Having found no difference between the senses, instincts and inner  feelings of the two races we come now to consider the oft-alleged  difference in what is popularly called _pure intellect_ in favour of the  white man. Is there such a thing as pure intellect or pure rationality?  Obviously there is not. The thought that we call abstract is fashioned  in the same way as the thought that is formed by the recognition of  similarities between concrete objects. The abstract thought has its  source like all other forms of thought in the organic and emotional  structure of the individual, and it is, indeed, only by pointing to  instances that we can define what we mean by an abstract idea. But many  people still think that the white race is gifted with a special faculty  for thinking about general attributes as apart from the particular  objects in which the abstracted attributes may be concretely perceived.  There is no foundation in fact for this presumption. The Natives have no  difficulty in finding words wherewith to abstract the general essence  from a plurality of facts or instances; their vocabulary is as apt and  as extensive for this purpose as that which suffices for the mental or  spiritual needs of the bulk of European people, indeed, the capacity for  abstracting the general nature and character from the particular  experience or emotion into pithy expressions by way of simile or  metaphor that admirably convey the perceived generalisation is as highly  evolved in the Native as in any other human variety.[17]    I think that the magistrates, native commissioners, police officers,  missionaries, farmers, miners, and traders in South Africa who have had  first-hand experience of dealing with raw Natives will agree with me  that in sound reasoning ability, as applied to matters with which he is  familiar, the Native is no whit below the white man. It would be easy  for me to give hundreds of instances that have come under my own  observation of arguments stated and deductions made by Natives who were  innocent of all European education that would show a capacity for mental  analysis and clear ratiocination equal to that of the educated European,  but I have to consider the reader's patience and will therefore confine  myself to a few illustrations taken at random from a number that were  written down by me at the time of observation. I may say here that my  translation into English has been made with the most scrupulous regard  to exactness so as to avoid the possibility of importing into the words  used a fuller meaning than that which was actually present in the  speaker's own mind.    In the Northern part of Matabeleland, not far from the Zambesi river,  lives a tribe called Bashankwe who follow a custom of marriage known  locally as \"ku garidzela\" which is in effect a rendering of personal  service, in the doing of such primitive husbandry as there obtains by  the prospective son-in-law for the parent of the girl chosen instead of  paying for her a consideration in money or cattle as is done by most of  the Natives in South Africa. It is a practice similar to the custom  which may be supposed to have been general in Palestine when Jacob  served for Rachel in the days of the Hebrew patriarchs. Sometime ago I  discussed the nature and present incidence of this custom with a chief  named Sileya of those parts, a wholly untutored Native. A point brought  up for settlement was the validity, under the present _regime_, of the  claim for compensation that under their law might be brought by a  rejected \"garidzela\" lover for the value of the work done by him during  his period of service when, at the end of such service, he found the  girl unwilling to marry him. I had explained to the chief that the white  man's government would always set its face against any custom whereby it  might be possible for the parents to pledge their daughters in marriage,  and had pointed out that this particular custom was for that reason not  viewed with favour by the authorities. To this Sileya replied: \"If you,  the Government, will make it plain that the man who finds himself  refused by the girl for whom he has been serving can claim compensation  for the work he has done then the fathers will become more careful than  they now are and they will refuse to accept the young man's services  save where the girl is old enough to consent for herself, for no man  likes to give up what he has won and held, and in this manner our old  custom will not go against the way of the Government.\" This reply, which  I have Englished almost literally, is typical of the Native form of  argumentation and it shows good all-round thinking ability; it is not a  particular instance of special intelligence, but a fair example of  average Native perspicacity.    A few months ago, while discussing with some elderly Matabele Natives  the subject of miscegenation in South Africa generally one of the old  men voiced the opinion of the meeting thus:    \"White people do what they like, they take what they like, and when they  like certain girls they take them, and what can we say? And, after all,  why should they not do so?

Also to pray without ceasing. We need to cry often to  God for help to overcome the evil that is in our own hearts, and the  snares of the world and the devil, 'who goeth about as a roaring lion  seeking whom he may devour.'\"    \"Papa,\" she said, looking up into his face, \"do you find it hard to be  good sometimes?\"    \"Yes, my child; I have the same battle to fight that you have, and I am  the more sorry for you because I know by experience how difficult it  sometimes is to do right.\"    \"And you have to help me by punishing me when I'm naughty, and making me  do as I ought?\"    \"Yes, and my battle is sometimes for patience with a naughty, disobedient  child.\"    \"I think you were very patient with me that time you kept me shut up so  long in this room,\" she said. \"If I'd been in your place I'd have got a  good switch and whipped my little girl till I made her obey me at once.\"    \"Do you think that would have been the better plan?\"    \"No, sir. I think you'd have had to 'most kill me before I'd have given  up, but if I'd been in your place I couldn't have had patience to wait.\"    \"You need to cultivate the grace of patience, then,\" he said gravely. \"Now  come with me to Max's room, and let us see if we can pack up his goods and  chattels.\"    \"Papa, I almost think I could pack it myself after watching you pack all  these others.\"    \"Possibly; but I shall do it more quickly, with you to help in getting all  the things together.\"    Every one was ready in due season for departure, and that night the two  cottages that for months past had been so full of light and life, were  dark, silent and deserted.    Arriving in Boston, the whole party took rooms at one of the principal  hotels. There they spent the night, but the greater part of the next day  was passed on board the captain's vessel.    The day after the parting came; a very hard one for him, his young wife  and children. Little feeble Gracie cried herself sick, and Violet found it  necessary to put aside the indulgence of her own grief in order to comfort  the nearly heart-broken child, who clung to her as she might have done to  her own mother.    Max and Lulu made no loud lament, but their quiet, subdued manner and sad  countenances told of deep and sincere sorrow, and, in truth, they often  felt ready to join in Gracie's oft-repeated cry, \"Oh, how can I do without  my dear, dear papa?\"    But they were with kind friends. Every one in the party showed them  sympathy, pretty presents were made them, and they were taken to see all  the sights of the city likely to interest them.    Grandma Elsie particularly endeared herself to them at this time by her  motherly tenderness and care, treating them as if they were her own  children.    Their father had given each two parting gifts, a handsome pocket Bible,  with the injunction to commit at least one verse to memory every day, and  a pretty purse with some spending money in it; for he knew they would  enjoy making purchases for themselves when visiting the city stores with  the older people.    So they did; and Lulu, who was generous to a fault, had soon spent her all  in gifts for others; a lovely new doll for Gracie, some books for Max, a  bottle of perfumery for \"Mamma Vi,\" and a toy for Walter.    Violet was much pleased with the present to herself as an evidence of  growing affection. She received it with warm thanks and a loving embrace.  \"My dear child, it was very kind in you to think of me!\" she said. \"It  makes me hope you have really given me a little place in your heart,  dear.\"    \"Oh, yes, Mamma Vi, indeed I have!\" cried the little girl, returning the  embrace. \"Surely we ought all to love you when you love our dear father so  much, and he loves you, too.\"    \"Certainly,\" said Max, who was standing by; \"we couldn't help loving so  sweet and pretty a lady if she was nothing at all to us and we lived in  the same house with her, and how can we think she's any less nice and  sweet just because she's married to our father?\"    \"And how can I help loving you because you are the children of my dear  husband?\" responded Violet, taking the boy's hand and pressing it warmly  in hers.    Some hours later Violet accidentally overheard part of a conversation  between her little sister Rose and Lulu.    \"Yes,\" Rosie was saying, \"mamma gives me fifty cents a week for spending  money.\"    \"Ah, how nice!\" exclaimed Lulu. \"Papa often gives us some money, but not  regularly, and Max and I have often talked together about how much we  would like to have a regular allowance. I'd be delighted, even if it  wasn't more than ten cents.\"    Violet had been wishing to give the children something, and trying to find  out what would be most acceptable, so was greatly pleased with the hint  given her by this little speech of Lulu's.    The child came presently to her side to bid her good-night. Violet put an  arm around her, and kissing her affectionately, said, \"Lulu, I have been  thinking you might like to have an allowance of pocket money, as Rosie  has. Would you?\"    \"O Mamma Vi! I'd like it better than anything else I can think of!\" cried  the little girl, her face sparkling with delight.    \"Then you shall have it and begin now,\" Violet said, taking out her purse  and putting two bright silver quarters into Lulu's hand.    \"Oh, thank you, mamma, how good and kind in you!\" cried the child.    \"Max shall have the same,\" said Violet, \"and Gracie half as much for the  present. When she is a little older it shall be doubled. Don't you want  the pleasure of telling Max, and taking this to him?\" she asked, putting  another half dollar into Lulu's hand.    \"Oh yes, ma'am! Thank you very much!\"    Max was on the farther side of the room--a good-sized parlor of the hotel  where they were staying--very much absorbed in a story-book; Lulu  approached him softly, a gleeful smile on her lips and in her eyes, and  laid his half dollar on the open page.    \"What's that for?\" he asked, looking round at her.    \"For you; and you're to have as much every week, Mamma Vi says.\"    \"O Lu! am I, really?\"    \"Yes; I too; and Gracie's to have a quarter.\"    \"Oh, isn't it splendid!\" he cried, and hurried to Violet to pour out his  thanks.    Grandma Elsie, seated on the sofa by Violet's side, shared with her the  pleasure of witnessing the children's delight.    Our friends had now spent several days in Boston, and the next morning  they left for Philadelphia, where they paid a short visit to relatives.  This was their last halt on the journey home to Ion.          CHAPTER VI.        \"--to the guiltless heart, where'er we roam,       No scenes delight us like our much-loved home.\"                            --Robert Hillhouse.      Elsie and her children had greatly enjoyed their summer at the North, but  now were filled with content and happiness at the thought of soon seeing  again their loved home at Ion, while Max and Lulu looked forward with  pleasing anticipations and eager curiosity to their first sight of it,  having heard various glowing descriptions of it from \"Mamma Vi\" and Rosie.    Their father, too, had spoken of it as a home so delightful that they  ought to feel the liveliest gratitude for having been invited to share its  blessings.    It was looking very beautiful, very inviting, on the arrival of our  travellers late in the afternoon of a warm, bright October day.    The woods and the trees that bordered the avenue were in the height of  their autumn glory, the gardens gay with many flowers of the most varied  and brilliant hues, and the lengthening shadows slept on a still green  and velvety lawn.    As their carriage turned into the avenue, Elsie bent an affectionate,  smiling look upon Max and Lulu, and taking a hand of each, said in  sweetest tones, \"Welcome to your new home, my dears, and may it prove to  you a very, very happy one.\"    \"Thank you, ma'am,\" they both responded, Max adding, \"I am very glad,  Grandma Elsie, that I am to live with you and Mamma Vi.\"    \"I, too,\" said Lulu; \"and in such a pretty place. Oh, how lovely  everything does look!\"    The air was delightful, and doors and windows stood wide open. On the  veranda a welcoming group was gathered. Elsie's brother and sister--Horace  Dinsmore, Jr., of the Oaks, and Mrs. Rose Lacey from the Laurels--and her  cousins Calhoun and Arthur Conly; while a little in the rear of them were  the servants, all--from old Uncle Joe, now in his ninety-fifth year, down  to Betty, his ten-year-old great-granddaughter--showing faces full of  eager delight.    They stood back respectfully till greetings had been exchanged between  relatives and friends, then pressed forward with their words of welcome,  sure of a shake of the hand and kind word from each member of the family.    Mr. Dinsmore held little Gracie in his arms. She was much fatigued and  exhausted by the long journey.    \"Here is a patient for you, Arthur,\" he said, \"and I am very glad you are  here to attend to her.\"    \"Yes,\" said Violet, \"her father charged me to put her in your care.\"    \"Then let her be put immediately to bed,\" said Arthur, after a moment's  scrutiny of the child. \"Give her to me, uncle, and I will carry her  up-stairs.\"    \"To my room,\" added Violet.    But the child shrunk from the stranger, and clung to Mr. Dinsmore.    \"No, thank you, I will take her up myself,\" he said. \"I am fully equal to  it,\" and he moved on through the hall and up the broad stairway, Violet  and the doctor following.    The others presently scattered to their rooms to rid themselves of the  dust of travel and dress for the evening.    \"Well, little wife, is it nice to be at home again?\" Edward asked, with a  smiling look at Zoe, as they entered their apartments.    \"Yes, indeed!\" she cried, sending a swift glance around the neat and  tastefully furnished room, \"especially such a home, and to be shared with  such nice people; one in particular who shall be"]]]
