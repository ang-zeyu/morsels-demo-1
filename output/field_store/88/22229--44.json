Most human beings love to forget at times their  sordid surroundings and wander in dreamland; hence the  enduring popularity of Becquer's works and especially of  the _Rimas_. Becquer has been widely imitated throughout  the Spanish-speaking world, but with little success. In  this connection it should be noted that the Spanish poets  who have most influenced the Spanish literature of the  nineteenth century, both in the Peninsula and in  America, are the Tyrtaean poet Quintana, the two leading  romanticists Espronceda and Zorrilla and the mystic  Becquer.    Like most writers in Latin lands, Juan VALERA y Alcala  Galiano (1824-1905) and Marcelino MENENDEZ Y PELAYO  (1856-1912) began their literary career with a volume or  two of lyric verses. Valera's verses have perfect metrical  form and evince high scholarship, but they are too learned  to be popular. The lyrics of Menendez y Pelayo have also  more merit in form than in inspiration and are lacking in  human interest. Both authors turned soon to more congenial  work: Valera became the most versatile and polished of all  nineteenth century Spanish writers of essays and novels;  and Menendez y Pelayo became Spain's greatest scholar in  literary history. The popular novelist, Pedro Antonio de  ALARCON (1833-1891), wrote lyrics in which there is a  curious blending of humor and skepticism.                      page xli  The foremost Spanish poet of the closing years of the  nineteenth century was Ramon de CAMPOAMOR y Campoosorio  (1817-1901) who is recognized as the initiator in Spain  of a new type of verse in his _Doloras_ and _Pequenos  poemas_. The _doloras_ are, for the most part, metrical  fables or epigrams, dramatic or anecdotal in form, in  which the author unites lightness of touch with depth  of feeling. The _pequeno poema_ is merely an enlarged  _dolora_. Campoamor disliked Byron and he disliked still  more the sonorous emptiness that is characteristic of too  much Spanish poetry.[4] In philosophy he revered Thomas  a Kempis; in form he aimed at conciseness and directness  rather than at artistic perfection. His poetry lacks  enthusiasm and coloring, but it has dramatic interest.    [Footnote 4: Menendez y Pelayo (_Ant. Poetas Hisp.-Am._,  I, p. lv) says: \"Al fin espanoles somos, y a tal profusion  de luz y a tal estrepito de palabras sonoras no hay entre  nosotros quien resista.\"]    The poets Manuel del PALACIO (1832-1895) and Federico  BALART (1831-1905), though quite unlike in genius, won the  esteem of their contemporaries. Palacio wrote excellent  sonnets and epigrams. In his _Leyendas y poemas_ he proved  his mastery of Spanish diction; he had, moreover, the  saving grace of humor which was so noticeably lacking in  Zorrilla's legends. The poet and literary critic, Balart,  achieved fame with his _Dolores_, in which he mourns with  sincere grief the death of his beloved wife. Mention  should also be made of the following poets who deserve  recognition in this brief review of the history of Spanish  lyric poetry: Vicente Wenceslao QUEROL (1836-1889), a  Valencian, whose _El eclipse, Cartas a Maria_, and _La  fiesta de Venus_, evince a remarkable technical skill  and an unusual correctness of diction; Teodoro                page xlii  LLORENTE (cf. p. 279); Jose GALIANO ALCALA whose verses  have delicate feeling and lively imagination; Emilio  FERRARI (b. 1853), the author of _Abelardo e Hipatia_  and _Aspiracion_; the pessimistic poets, Joaquin Maria de  BARTRINA (1850-1880) and Gabino TEJADO; Salvador RUEDA (b.  1857), author of _El bloque_, _En tropel_ and _Cantos  de la vendimia_; and the poet and dramatist, Eduardo  MARQUINA.    After the death of Campoamor in the first year of the  twentieth century, the title of _doyen_ of Spanish  letters fell by universal acclaim to Gaspar NUNEZ DE ARCE  (1834-1903). Nunez de Arce was a lyric poet, a dramatist  and a writer of polemics, but first of all a man  of action. With him the solution of political and  sociological problems was all-important, and his literary  writings were mostly the expression of his sociological  and political views. Nunez de Arce is best known for his  _Gritos del combate_ (1875), in which he sings of liberty  but opposes anarchy with energy and courage. As a satirist  he attacks the excesses of radicalism as well as the vices  and foibles common to mankind.[5] As a poet he is neither  original nor imaginative, and often his ideas are unduly  limited; but he writes with a manly vigor that is rare  amongst Spanish lyric poets, most of whom have given first  place to the splendors of rhetoric.    [Footnote 5: Speaking of Nunez de Arce's satire, Juan  Valera says humorously, in _Florilegio de poesias  castellanas del siglo XIX_, Madrid, 1902, Vol. I, p. 247:  \"Esta el poeta tan enojado contra la sociedad, contra  nuestra descarriada civilizacion y contra los crimenes y  maldades de ahora, y nos pinta tan perverso, tan vicioso  y tan infeliz al hombre de nuestros dias, atormentado por  dudas, remordimientos, codicias y otras viles pasiones,  que, a mi ver, lejos de avergonzarse este hombre de  descender del mono, debiera ser el mono quien se  avergonzara de haberse humanado.\"]    Most writers on the history of European literatures have     page xliii called attention to the fact that at the  beginning of the nineteenth century there was a great  outpouring of lyricism, which infused itself into prose  as well as verse. When this movement had exhausted itself  there came by inevitable reaction a period of materialism,  when realism succeeded romanticism and prose fiction  largely replaced verse. And now sociological and  pseudo-scientific writings threaten the very existence of  idealistic literature. And yet through it all there has  been no dearth of poets. Browning in England and Campoamor  in Spain, like many before them, have given metrical form  to the expression of their philosophical views. And other  poets, who had an intuitive aversion to science, have  taken refuge in pure idealism and have created worlds  after their own liking. To-day prose is recognized as  the best medium for the promulgation of scientific or  political teachings, and those who are by nature poets are  turning to art for art's sake. Poetry is less didactic  than formerly, and it is none the less beautiful and  inspiring.    The _Notes_ to this volume contain historical sketches of  the literatures of Argentina (p. 279), Colombia (p. 285),  Cuba (p. 291), Ecuador and Peru (p. 296), Mexico (p. 307),  and Venezuela (p. 315). It is to be regretted that lack of  space has excluded an account of the literatures of other  Spanish-American countries, and especially of Chile and  Uruguay.                                  III                      SPANISH VERSIFICATION    Spanish versification is subject to the following general  laws:    (1) There must be a harmonious flow of syllables, in which  harsh combinations of sounds are avoided. This                page xliv  usually requires that stressed syllables be separated by  one or more unstressed syllables.[6]    [Footnote 6: By stress is meant secondary as well as  primary syllabic stress. Thus, _en nuestra vida_ has  primary stress on _vi-_, and secondary stress on _nues-_.]    (2) Verse must be divided into phrases, each of which can  be uttered easily as one breath-group. The phrases are  normally of not less than four nor more than eight  syllables, with a rhythmic accent on the next to the last  syllable of each phrase.[7] Phrases of a fixed number of  syllables must recur at regular intervals. There may or  may not be a pause at the end of the phrase.    [Footnote 7: The unstressed syllable may be lacking, or  there may be two unstressed syllables, after the rhythmic  accent. See under _Syllabication_.]    (_a_) In the n-syllable binary line the phrases may recur  at irregular intervals. In lines with regular ternary  movement phrasing is largely replaced by rhythmic  pulsation (cf. p. lxx).    (3) There must be rime of final syllables, or final  vowels, recurring at regular intervals.    (_a_) In some metrical arrangements of foreign origin the  rimes recur at irregular intervals, or there is no rime  at all. See the _silva_ and _versos sueltos_ under  _Strophes_.    Whether normal Spanish verse has, or ever had, binary  movement, with the occasional substitution of a \"troche\"  for an \"iambic,\" or vice-versa, is in dispute.[8] That is,  whether in Spanish verse, with the usual movement, (1)  the alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables is  essential, or whether (2) the mere balancing of                page xlv  certain larger blocks of syllables is sufficient. For  instance, in this line of Luis de Leon:      ya muestra en esperanza el fruto cierto,    is there regular rhythmic pulsation, much less marked  than in English verse, doubtless,--but still an easily  discernible alternation of stressed and unstressed  syllables? If so, there must be secondary stress on _es-_.  Or is _ya muestra en esperanza_ one block, and _el fruto  cierto_ another, with no rhythmic stresses except those on  _-anza_ and _cierto_?    [Footnote 8: There are in Spanish certain types of verses  in which there is regular ternary movement throughout.  These are treated separately. Cf. p. lxx.]      The truth seems to be that symmetry of phrases (the  balancing of large blocks of syllables) is an essential  and important part of modern Spanish versification; but  that, in musical verse of the ordinary type, there is  also a subtle and varied binary movement, while in some  recitative verse (notably the dramatic _romance_ verse)  the binary movement is almost or quite negligible.[9]    [Footnote 9: A count of Spanish verses (none from drama),  by arbitrarily assuming three contiguous atonic syllables  to be equal to-[/-]-(with secondary stress on the middle  syllable),"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1606"],[0,"Kenilworth (#7)"],[1,"house; but his inquiries only set the host upon a new theme of  declamation against the wiles of the fair sex, in which he brought, at  full length, the whole wisdom of Solomon to reinforce his own. Finally,  he turned his admonitions, mixed with much objurgation, upon his  tapsters and drawers, who were employed in removing the relics of the  entertainment, and restoring order to the apartment; and at length,  joining example to precept, though with no good success, he demolished  a salver with half a score of glasses, in attempting to show how such  service was done at the Three Cranes in the Vintry, then the most  topping tavern in London. This last accident so far recalled him to his  better self, that he retired to his bed, slept sound, and awoke a new  man in the morning.            CHAPTER III.           Nay, I'll hold touch--the game shall be play'd out;       It ne'er shall stop for me, this merry wager:       That which I say when gamesome, I'll avouch       In my most sober mood, ne'er trust me else.   THE HAZARD TABLE.    \"And how doth your kinsman, good mine host?\" said Tressilian, when Giles  Gosling first appeared in the public room, on the morning following the  revel which we described in the last chapter. \"Is he well, and will he  abide by his wager?\"    \"For well, sir, he started two hours since, and has visited I know not  what purlieus of his old companions; hath but now returned, and is at  this instant breakfasting on new-laid eggs and muscadine. And for his  wager, I caution you as a friend to have little to do with that, or  indeed with aught that Mike proposes. Wherefore, I counsel you to a warm  breakfast upon a culiss, which shall restore the tone of the stomach;  and let my nephew and Master Goldthred swagger about their wager as they  list.\"    \"It seems to me, mine host,\" said Tressilian, \"that you know not well  what to say about this kinsman of yours, and that you can neither blame  nor commend him without some twinge of conscience.\"    \"You have spoken truly, Master Tressilian,\" replied Giles Gosling.  \"There is Natural Affection whimpering into one ear, 'Giles, Giles, why  wilt thou take away the good name of thy own nephew? Wilt thou defame  thy sister's son, Giles Gosling? wilt thou defoul thine own nest,  dishonour thine own blood?' And then, again, comes Justice, and says,  'Here is a worthy guest as ever came to the bonny Black Bear; one who  never challenged a reckoning' (as I say to your face you never did,  Master Tressilian--not that you have had cause), 'one who knows not why  he came, so far as I can see, or when he is going away; and wilt thou,  being a publican, having paid scot and lot these thirty years in the  town of Cumnor, and being at this instant head-borough, wilt thou suffer  this guest of guests, this man of men, this six-hooped pot (as I may  say) of a traveller, to fall into the meshes of thy nephew, who is known  for a swasher and a desperate Dick, a carder and a dicer, a professor of  the seven damnable sciences, if ever man took degrees in them?' No,  by Heaven! I might wink, and let him catch such a small butterfly as  Goldthred; but thou, my guest, shall be forewarned, forearmed, so thou  wilt but listen to thy trusty host.\"    \"Why, mine host, thy counsel shall not be cast away,\" replied  Tressilian; \"however, I must uphold my share in this wager, having once  passed my word to that effect. But lend me, I pray, some of thy counsel.  This Foster, who or what is he, and why makes he such mystery of his  female inmate?\"    \"Troth,\" replied Gosling, \"I can add but little to what you heard last  night. He was one of Queen Mary's Papists, and now he is one of Queen  Elizabeth's Protestants; he was an onhanger of the Abbot of Abingdon;  and now he lives as master of the Manor-house. Above all, he was  poor, and is rich. Folk talk of private apartments in his old waste  mansion-house, bedizened fine enough to serve the Queen, God bless her!  Some men think he found a treasure in the orchard, some that he sold  himself to the devil for treasure, and some say that he cheated the  abbot out of the church plate, which was hidden in the old Manor-house  at the Reformation. Rich, however, he is, and God and his conscience,  with the devil perhaps besides, only know how he came by it. He has  sulky ways too--breaking off intercourse with all that are of the place,  as if he had either some strange secret to keep, or held himself to be  made of another clay than we are. I think it likely my kinsman and he  will quarrel, if Mike thrust his acquaintance on him; and I am sorry  that you, my worthy Master Tressilian, will still think of going in my  nephew's company.\"    Tressilian again answered him, that he would proceed with great caution,  and that he should have no fears on his account; in short, he bestowed  on him all the customary assurances with which those who are determined  on a rash action are wont to parry the advice of their friends.    Meantime, the traveller accepted the landlord's invitation, and had just  finished the excellent breakfast, which was served to him and Gosling  by pretty Cicely, the beauty of the bar, when the hero of the preceding  night, Michael Lambourne, entered the apartment. His toilet had  apparently cost him some labour, for his clothes, which differed from  those he wore on his journey, were of the newest fashion, and put on  with great attention to the display of his person.    \"By my faith, uncle,\" said the gallant, \"you made a wet night of it, and  I feel it followed by a dry morning. I will pledge you willingly in a  cup of bastard.--How, my pretty coz Cicely! why, I left you but a child  in the cradle, and there thou stand'st in thy velvet waistcoat, as tight  a girl as England's sun shines on. Know thy friends and kindred,  Cicely, and come hither, child, that I may kiss thee, and give thee my  blessing.\"    \"Concern not yourself about Cicely, kinsman,\" said Giles Gosling, \"but  e'en let her go her way, a' God's name; for although your mother were  her father's sister, yet that shall not make you and her cater-cousins.\"    \"Why, uncle,\" replied Lambourne, \"think'st thou I am an infidel, and  would harm those of mine own house?\"    \"It is for no harm that I speak, Mike,\" answered his uncle, \"but a  simple humour of precaution which I have. True, thou art as well gilded  as a snake when he casts his old slough in the spring time; but for all  that, thou creepest not into my Eden. I will look after mine Eve, Mike,  and so content thee.--But how brave thou be'st, lad! To look on thee  now, and compare thee with Master Tressilian here, in his sad-coloured  riding-suit, who would not say that thou wert the real gentleman and he  the tapster's boy?\"    \"Troth, uncle,\" replied Lambourne, \"no one would say so but one of your  country-breeding, that knows no better. I will say, and I care not who  hears me, there is something about the real gentry that few men come up  to that are not born and bred to the mystery. I wot not where the trick  lies; but although I can enter an ordinary with as much audacity, rebuke  the waiters and drawers as loudly, drink as deep a health, swear as  round an oath, and fling my gold as freely about as any of the jingling  spurs and white feathers that are around me, yet, hang me if I can ever  catch the true grace of it, though I have practised an hundred times.  The man of the house sets me lowest at the board, and carves to me the  last; and the drawer says, 'Coming, friend,' without any more reverence  or regardful addition. But, hang it, let it pass; care killed a cat. I  have gentry enough to pass the trick on Tony Fire-the-Faggot, and that  will do for the matter in hand.\"    \"You hold your purpose, then, of visiting your old acquaintance?\" said  Tressilian to the adventurer.    \"Ay, sir,\" replied Lambourne; \"when stakes are made, the game must be  played; that is gamester's law, all over the world. You, sir, unless  my memory fails me (for I did steep it somewhat too deeply in the  sack-butt), took some share in my hazard?\"    \"I propose to accompany you in your adventure,\" said Tressilian, \"if you  will do me so much grace as to permit me; and I have staked my share of  the forfeit in the hands of our worthy host.\"    \"That he hath,\" answered Giles Gosling, \"in as fair Harry-nobles as ever  were melted into sack by a good fellow. So, luck to your enterprise,  since you will needs venture on Tony Foster; but, by my credit, you had  better take another draught before you depart, for your welcome at  the Hall yonder will be somewhat of the driest. And if you do get into  peril, beware of taking to cold steel; but send for me, Giles Gosling,  the head-borough, and I may be able to make something out of Tony yet,  for as proud as he is.\"    The nephew dutifully obeyed his uncle's hint, by taking a second  powerful pull at the tankard, observing that his wit never served him  so well as when he had washed his temples with a deep morning's draught;  and they set forth together for the habitation of Anthony Foster.    The village of Cumnor is pleasantly built on a hill, and in a wooded  park closely adjacent was situated the ancient mansion occupied at this  time by Anthony Foster, of which the ruins may be still extant. The park  was then full of large trees, and in particular of ancient and mighty  oaks, which stretched their giant arms over the high wall surrounding  the demesne, thus giving it a melancholy, secluded, and monastic  appearance. The entrance to the park lay through an old-fashioned  gateway in the outer wall, the door of which was formed of two huge  oaken leaves thickly studded with nails, like the gate of an old town.    \"We shall be finely helped up here,\" said Michael Lambourne, looking at  the gateway and gate, \"if this fellow's suspicious humour should  refuse us admission altogether, as it is like he may, in case this  linsey-wolsey fellow of a mercer's visit to his"]]]
