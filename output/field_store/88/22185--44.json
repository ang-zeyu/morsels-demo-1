This end is  reached by many characteristic changes in the division of labor; also  by a new division between supervisors and workers, by transformations  of the work itself and of the tools and vehicles. But as a by-product  of these efforts the demand necessarily arose for means by which the  fit individuals could be found for special kinds of labor. The more  scientific management introduced changes, by which the individual  achievement often had to become rather complicated and difficult, the  more it became necessary to study the skill and the endurance and the  intelligence of the individual laborers in order to entrust these new  difficult tasks only to the most appropriate men in the factories and  mills. The problem of individual selection accordingly forced itself  on the new efficiency engineers, and they naturally recognized that  the really essential traits and dispositions were the mental ones. In  the most progressive books of the new movement, this need of  emphasizing the selection of workers with reference to their mental  equipment comes to clear expression.    Yet this is very far from a real application of scientific psychology  to the problem at hand. Wherever the question of the selection of the  fit men after psychological principles is mentioned in the literature  of this movement, the language becomes vague, and the same men, who  use the newest scientific knowledge whenever physics or mathematics or  physiology or chemistry are involved, make hardly any attempts to  introduce the results of science when psychology is in question. The  clearest insight into the general situation may be found in the most  recent books by Emerson. He says frankly: \"It is psychology, not soil  or climate, that enables man to raise five times as many potatoes per  acre as the average in his own state\";[7] or: \"In selecting human  assistants such superficialities as education, as physical strength,  even antecedent morality, are not as important as the inner attitudes,  proclivities, character, which after all determine the man or  woman.\"[8] He also fully recognizes the necessity of securing as early  as possible the psychological essentials. He says: \"The type for the  great newspaper is set up by linotype operators. Apprenticeship is  rigorously limited. Some operators can never get beyond the 2500-em  class, others with no more personal effort can set 5000 ems. Do the  employers test out applicants for apprenticeship so as to be sure to  secure boys who will develop into the 5000-em class? They do not: they  select applicants for any near reason except the fundamental important  one of innate fitness.\"[9] But all this points only to the existence  of the problem, and in reality gives not even a hint for its solution.  The theorists of scientific management seem to think that the most  subtle methods are indispensable for physical measurements, but for  psychological inquiry nothing but a kind of intuition is necessary.  Emerson tells how, for instance, \"The competent specialist who has  supplemented natural gifts and good judgment by analysis and synthesis  can perceive attitudes and proclivities even in the very young, much  more readily in those semi-matured, and can with almost infallible  certainty point out, not only what work can be undertaken with fair  hope of success, but also what slight modification or addition and  diminution will more than double the personal power.\"[10] The true  psychological specialists surely ought to decline this flattering  confidence. Far from the \"almost infallible certainty,\" they can  hardly expect even a moderate amount of success in such directions so  long as specific methods have not been elaborated, and so long as no  way has been shown to make experimental measurements by which such  mere guesswork can be replaced by scientific investigation.    The only modest effort to try a step in this direction toward the  psychological laboratory is recorded by Taylor,[11] who tells of Mr.  S.E. Thompson's work in a bicycle ball factory, where a hundred and  twenty girls were inspecting the balls. They had to place a row of  small polished steel balls on the back of the left hand and while they  were rolled over and over in the crease between two of the fingers  placed together, they were minutely examined in a strong light and the  defective balls were picked out with the aid of a magnet held in the  right hand. The work required the closest attention and concentration.  The girls were working ten and a half hours a day. Mr. Thompson soon  recognized that the quality most needed, beside endurance and  industry, was a quick power of perception accompanied by quick  responsive action. He knew that the psychological laboratory has  developed methods for a very exact measurement of the time needed to  react on an impression with the quickest possible movement; it is  called the reaction time, and is usually measured in thousandths of a  second. He therefore considered it advisable to measure the  reaction-time of the girls, and to eliminate from service all those  who showed a relatively long time between the stimulus and reaction.  This involved laying off many of the most intelligent, hardest-working,  and most trustworthy girls. Yet the effect was the possibility of  shortening the hours and of reducing more and more the number of  workers, with the final outcome that thirty-five girls did the work  formerly done by a hundred and twenty, and that the accuracy of the  work at the higher speed was two thirds greater than at the former  slow speed. This allowed almost a doubling of the wages of the girls  in spite of their shorter working-day, and at the same time a  considerable reduction in the cost of the work for the factory. This  excursion of an efficiency engineer into the psychological laboratory  remained, however; an entirely exceptional case. Moreover, such a  reaction-time measurement did not demand any special development of  new methods or any particular mental analysis, and this exception thus  confirms the rule that the followers of scientific management  principles have recognized the need of psychological inquiries, but  have not done anything worth mentioning to apply the results of really  scientific psychology. Hence the situation is the same as in the field  of vocational guidance. In both cases a vague longing for  psychological analysis and psychological measurement, but in both  cases so far everything has remained on the level of helpless  psychological dilettantism. It stands in striking contrast with the  scientific seriousness with which the economic questions are taken up  in the field of vocational guidance and the physical questions in the  field of scientific management. It is, therefore, evidently the duty  of the experimental psychologists themselves to examine the ground  from the point of view of the psychological laboratory.          VII    THE METHODS OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY      We now see clearly the psychotechnical problem. We have to analyze  definite economic tasks with reference to the mental qualities which  are necessary or desirable for them, and we have to find methods by  which these mental qualities can be tested. We must, indeed, insist on  it that the interests of commerce and industry can be helped only when  both sides, the vocational demands and the personal function, are  examined with equal scientific thoroughness. One aspect alone is  unsatisfactory. It would of course be possible to confine the  examination to the individual mental traits, and then theoretically to  determine for which economic tasks the presence of these qualities  would be useful and for which tasks their absence or their deficiency  would be fatal. Common sense may be sufficient to lead us a few steps  in that direction. For instance, if we find by psychological  examination that an individual is color-blind for red and green  sensations, we may at once conclude, without any real psychological  analysis of the vocations, that he would be unfit for the railroad  service or the naval service, in which red and green signals are of  importance. We may also decide at once that such a boy would be  useless for all artistic work in which the nuances of colors are of  consequence, or as a laborer in certain departments of a dyeing  establishment, and that such a color-blind girl would not do at a  dressmaker's or in a millinery store. But if we come to the question  whether such a color-blind individual may enter into the business of  gardening, in spite of the inability to distinguish the strawberries  in the bed or the red flowers among the green leaves, the first  necessity, after all, would be to find out how far the particular  demands of this vocation make the ability to discriminate color a  prerequisite, and how far psychical substitutions such as a  recognition of the forms and of differences in the light intensity,  may be sufficient for the practical task. Moreover, where not merely  such mental defects, but more subtly shaded variations within normal  limits are involved, it would be superficial, if only the mental  states were examined and not at the same time the mental requirements  of the vocations themselves. The vocation should rather remain the  starting-point. We must at first find out what demands on the mental  system are made by it and we must grade these demands in order to  recognize the more or less important ones, and, especially for the  important ones, we must then seek exact standards with experimental  methods.    Such an experimental investigation may proceed according to either of  two different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#7)"],[1,"of the fox's liver, prescribed in the tale, I may  add that there would be nothing strange in this to a person acquainted  with the Chinese pharmacopoeia, which the Japanese long exclusively  followed, although they are now successfully studying the art of healing  as practised in the West. When I was at Peking, I saw a Chinese  physician prescribe a decoction of three scorpions for a child struck  down with fever; and on another occasion a groom of mine, suffering from  dysentery, was treated with acupuncture of the tongue. The art of  medicine would appear to be at the present time in China much in the  state in which it existed in Europe in the sixteenth century, when the  excretions and secretions of all manner of animals, saurians, and  venomous snakes and insects, and even live bugs, were administered to  patients. \"Some physicians,\" says Matthiolus, \"use the ashes of  scorpions, burnt alive, for retention caused by either renal or vesical  calculi. But I have myself thoroughly experienced the utility of an oil  I make myself, whereof scorpions form a very large portion of the  ingredients. If only the region of the heart and all the pulses of the  body be anointed with it, it will free the patients from the effects of  all kinds of poisons taken by the mouth, corrosive ones excepted.\"  Decoctions of Egyptian mummies were much commended, and often prescribed  with due academical solemnity; and the bones of the human skull,  pulverized and administered with oil, were used as a specific in cases  of renal calculus. (See Petri Andreae Matthioli \"Opera,\" 1574.)    These remarks were made to me by a medical gentleman to whom I mentioned  the Chinese doctor's prescription of scorpion tea, and they seem to me  so curious that I insert them for comparison's sake.

He is  represented carrying a few ears of rice, and is symbolized by a snake  guarding a bale of rice grain. The foxes wait upon him, and do his  bidding. Inasmuch as rice is the most important and necessary product of  Japan, the honours which Inari Sama receives are extraordinary. Almost  every house in the country contains somewhere about the grounds a pretty  little shrine in his honour; and on a certain day of the second month of  the year his feast is celebrated with much beating of drums and other  noises, in which the children take a special delight. \"On this day,\"  says the O-Satsuyo, a Japanese cyclopaedia, \"at Yeddo, where there are  myriads upon myriads of shrines to Inari Sama, there are all sorts of  ceremonies. Long banners with inscriptions are erected, lamps and  lanterns are hung up, and the houses are decked with various dolls and  figures; the sound of flutes and drums is heard, and people dance and  make holiday according to their fancy. In short, it is the most bustling  festival of the Yeddo year.\"]          VII    THE BADGER'S MONEY      It is a common saying among men that to forget favours received is the  part of a bird or a beast: an ungrateful man will be ill spoken of by  all the world. And yet even birds and beasts will show gratitude; so  that a man who does not requite a favour is worse even than dumb brutes.  Is not this a disgrace?    Once upon a time, in a hut at a place called Namekata, in Hitachi, there  lived an old priest famous neither for learning nor wisdom, but bent  only on passing his days in prayer and meditation. He had not even a  child to wait upon him, but prepared his food with his own hands. Night  and morning he recited the prayer \"Namu Amida Butsu,\"[3] intent upon  that alone. Although the fame of his virtue did not reach far, yet his  neighbours respected and revered him, and often brought him food and  raiment; and when his roof or his walls fell out of repair, they would  mend them for him; so for the things of this world he took no thought.    One very cold night, when he little thought any one was outside, he  heard a voice calling, \"Your reverence! your reverence!\" So he rose and  went out to see who it was, and there he beheld an old badger standing.  Any ordinary man would have been greatly alarmed at the apparition; but  the priest, being such as he has been described above, showed no sign of  fear, but asked the creature its business. Upon this the badger  respectfully bent its knees and said:    \"Hitherto, sir, my lair has been in the mountains, and of snow or frost  I have taken no heed; but now I am growing old, and this severe cold is  more than I can bear. I pray you to let me enter and warm myself at the  fire of your cottage, that I may live through this bitter night.\"    When the priest heard what a helpless state the beast was reduced to, he  was filled with pity and said:    \"That's a very slight matter: make haste and come in and warm yourself.\"    The badger, delighted with so good a reception, went into the hut, and  squatting down by the fire began to warm itself; and the priest, with  renewed fervour, recited his prayers and struck his bell before the  image of Buddha, looking straight before him.    After two hours the badger took its leave, with profuse expressions of  thanks, and went out; and from that time forth it came every night to  the hut. As the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches  and dead leaves from the hills for firewood, the priest at last became  very friendly with it, and got used to its company; so that if ever, as  the night wore on, the badger did not arrive, he used to miss it, and  wonder why it did not come. When the winter was over, and the springtime  came at the end of the second month, the badger gave up its visits, and  was no more seen; but, on the return of the winter, the beast resumed  its old habit of coming to the hut. When this practice had gone on for  ten years, one day the badger said to the priest, \"Through your  reverence's kindness for all these years, I have been able to pass the  winter nights in comfort. Your favours are such that during all my life,  and even after my death, I must remember them. What can I do to requite  them? If there is anything that you wish for, pray tell me.\"    The priest, smiling at this speech, answered: \"Being such as I am, I  have no desire and no wishes. Glad as I am to hear your kind intentions,  there is nothing that I can ask you to do for me. You need feel no  anxiety on my account. As long as I live, when the winter comes, you  shall be welcome here.\" The badger, on hearing this, could not conceal  its admiration of the depth of the old man's benevolence; but having so  much to be grateful for, it felt hurt at not being able to requite it.  As this subject was often renewed between them, the priest at last,  touched by the goodness of the badger's heart, said: \"Since I have  shaven my head, renounced the world, and forsaken the pleasures of this  life, I have no desire to gratify, yet I own I should like to possess  three riyos in gold. Food and raiment I receive by the favour of the  villagers, so I take no heed for those things. Were I to die to-morrow,  and attain my wish of being born again into the next world, the same  kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body. Thus, although I have  no other reason to wish for money, still if I had three riyos I would  offer them up at some holy shrine, that masses and prayers might be said  for me, whereby I might enter into salvation. Yet I would not get this  money by violent or unlawful means; I only think of what might be if I  had it. So you see, since you have expressed such kind feelings toward  me, I have told you what is on my mind.\" When the priest had done  speaking, the badger leant its head on one side with a puzzled and  anxious look, so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a  wish which seemed to give the beast trouble, and tried to retract what  he had said. \"Posthumous honours, after all, are the wish of ordinary  men. I, who am a priest, ought not to entertain such thoughts, or to  want money; so pray pay no attention to what I have said;\" and the  badger, feigning assent to what the priest had impressed upon it,  returned to the hills as usual.    From that time forth the badger came no more to the hut. The priest  thought this very strange, but imagined either that the badger stayed  away because it did not like to come without the money, or that it had  been killed in an attempt to steal it; and he blamed himself for having  added to his sins for no purpose, repenting when it was too late:  persuaded, however, that the badger must have been killed, he passed his  time in putting up prayers upon prayers for it.    After three years had gone by, one night the old man heard a voice near  his door calling out, \"Your reverence! your reverence!\"    As the voice was like that of the badger, he jumped up as soon as he  heard it, and ran to open the door; and there, sure enough, was the  badger. The priest, in great delight, cried out: \"And so you are safe  and sound, after all! Why have you been so long without coming here? I  have been expecting you anxiously this long while.\"    So the badger came into the hut and said: \"If the money which you  required had been for unlawful purposes, I could easily have procured as  much as ever you might have wanted; but when I heard that it was to be  offered to a temple for masses for your soul, I thought that, if I were  to steal the hidden treasure of some other man,"]]]
