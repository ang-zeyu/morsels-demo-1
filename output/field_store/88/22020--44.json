MATHER:      \"Remember this, That as a sparrow falls not to the ground       Without the will of God, so not a Devil       Can come down from the air without his leave.       We must inquire.\"    HATHORNE:      \"Dear sir, we have inquired;      Sifted the matter thoroughly through and through,      And then resifted it.\"    MATHER:      \"If God permits      These evil spirits from the unseen regions      To visit us with surprising informations,      We must inquire what cause there is for this,      But not receive the testimony borne      By spectres as conclusive proof of guilt      In the accused.\"    HATHORNE:      \"Upon such evidence      We do not rest our case. The ways are many      In which the guilty do betray themselves.\"    MATHER:      \"Be careful, carry the knife with such exactness      That on one side no innocent blood be shed      By too excessive zeal, and on the other      No shelter given to any work of darkness.\"        _New England Tragedies_ (4, 725), LONGFELLOW.    Whatever Mather's caution to the court may have been, or his leadership  in learning, or his ambition and his clerical zeal, there is thus far no  evidence, in all his personal participation in the tragedies, that he  lifted his hand to stay the storm of terrorism once begun, or cried halt  to the magistrates in their relentless work. On the contrary, after six  victims had been executed, August 4, 1692, in _A Discourse on the  Wonders of the Invisible World_, Mather wrote this in deliberate, cool  afterthought:    \"They--the judges--have used as judges have heretofore done, the  spectral evidences, to introduce their farther inquiries into the lives  of the persons accused; and they have thereupon, by the wonderful  Providence of God, been so strengthened with other evidences that some  of the witch-gang have been fairly executed.\"    And a year later, in the light of all his personal experience and  investigation, Mather solemnly declared:    \"If in the midst of the many dissatisfactions among us, the publication  of these trials may promote such a pious thankfulness unto God for  justice being so far executed among us, I shall rejoice that God is  glorified.\"    Wherever the responsibility at Salem may have rested, the truth is that  in the general fear and panic there was potent in the minds, both of the  clergy and the laity, the spirit of fanaticism and malevolence in some  instances, such as misled the pastor of the First Church to point to the  corpses of Giles Corey's devoted and saintly wife and others swinging to  and fro, and say \"What a sad thing it is to see eight firebrands of hell  hanging there.\"    This conspectus of witchcraft, old and new, of its development from the  sorcery and magic of the ancients into the mediaeval theological dogma  of the power of Satan, of its gradual ripening into an epidemic  demonopathy, of its slow growth in the American colonies, of its  volcanic outburst in the close of the seventeenth century, is relevant  and appropriate to this account of the delusion in Connecticut, its rise  and suppression, its firm hold on the minds and consciences of the  colonial leaders for threescore years after the settlement of the towns,  a chapter in Connecticut history written in the presence of the actual  facts now made known and available, and with a purpose of historic  accuracy.          CHAPTER V    \"It was not to be expected of the colonists of New England that they  should be the first to see through a delusion which befooled the whole  civilized world, and the gravest and most knowing persons in it. The  colonists in Connecticut and New Haven, as well as in Massachusetts,  like all other Christian people at that time--at least with extremely  rare individual exceptions--believed in the reality of a hideous crime  called witchcraft.\" PALFREY'S _New England_ (Vol. IV, pp. 96-127).    \"The truth is that it [witchcraft] pervaded the whole Christian Church.  The law makers and the ministers of New England were under its  influences as--and no more than--were the law makers and ministers of  Old England.\" _Blue Laws--True and False_ (p. 23), TRUMBULL.    \"One ---- of Windsor Arraigned and Executed at Hartford for a Witch.\"  WINTHROP'S _Journal_ (2: 374, Savage Ed., 1853).      Here beginneth the first chapter of the story of the delusion in  Connecticut. It is an entry made by John Winthrop, Governor of the  Massachusetts Bay Colony, in his famous journal, without specific date,  but probably in the spring of 1647.    It is of little consequence save as much has been made of it by some  writers as fixing the relative date of the earliest execution for  witchcraft in New England, and locating it in one of the three original  Connecticut towns.    What matters it at this day whether Mary Johnson as tradition runs, or  Alse Youngs as truth has it, was put to death for witchcraft in Windsor,  Connecticut, in 1647, or Martha Jones of Charlestown, Massachusetts, was  hung for the same crime at Boston in 1648, as also set down in  Winthrop's Journal?    \"It may possibly be thought a great neglect, or matter of partiality,  that no account is given of witchcraft in Connecticut. The only reason  is, that after the most careful researches, no indictment of any person  for that crime, nor any process relative to that affair can be found.\"  (_History of Connecticut_, 1799, Preface, BENJAMIN TRUMBULL, D.D.)    \"A few words should be said regarding the author's mention of the  subject of witchcraft in Connecticut.... It is, I believe, strictly  true, as he says 'that no indictment of any person for that crime nor  any process relative to that affair can be found.'    \"It must be confessed, however, that a careful study of the official  colonial records of Connecticut and New Haven leaves no doubt that  Goodwife Bassett was convicted and hung at Stratford for witchcraft in  1651, and Goodwife Knapp at Fairfield in 1653. It is also recorded in  Winthrop's _Journal_ that 'One ---- of Windsor was arraigned and executed  at Hartford for a witch' in March, 1646-47, which if it actually  occurred, forms the first instance of an execution for witchcraft in New  England. The quotation here given is the only known authority for the  statement, and opens the question whether something probably recorded as  hearsay in a journal, may be taken as authoritative evidence of an  occurrence.... The fact however remains, that the official records are  as our author says, silent regarding the actual proceedings, and it is  only by inference that it may be found from these records that the  executions took place.\" (Introduction to Reprint of _Trumbull's History  of Connecticut_, 1898, JONATHAN TRUMBULL.)    The searcher for inerrant information about witchcraft in Connecticut  may easily be led into a maze of contradictions, and the statement last  above quoted is an apt illustration, with record evidence to the  contrary on every hand. Tradition, hearsay, rumor, misstatements,  errors, all colored by ignorance or half knowledge, or a local jealousy  or pride, have been woven into a woof of precedent and acceptance, and  called history.    As has been already stated, the general writers from Trumbull to  Johnston have nothing of value to say on the subject; the open official  records and the latest history--_Connecticut as a Colony and a  State_--cover only certain cases, and nowhere from the beginning to this  day has the story of witchcraft been fully told.    Connecticut can lose nothing in name or fame or honor, if, more than two  centuries after the last witch was executed within her borders, the  facts as to her share in the strange superstition be certified from the  current records of the events.    How may this story best be told? Clearly, so far as may be, in the very  words of the actors in those tragic scenes, in the words of the minister  and magistrate, the justice and the juryman, the accuser and the  accused, and the searcher. Into this court of inquiry come all these  personalities to witness the sorrowful march of the victims to the  scaffold or to exile, or to acquittal and deliverance with the after  life of suspicion and social ostracism.    The spectres of terror did not sit alone at the firesides of the poor  and lowly: they stalked in high places, and were known of men and women  of the first rank in education and the social virtues, and of greatest  influence in church and state.    Of this fact there is complete demonstration in a glance at the  dignitaries who presided at one of the earliest witchcraft trials--men  of notable ancestry, of learning, of achievements, leaders in colonial  affairs, whose memories are honored to this day.    These were the magistrates at a session entitled \"A particular courte in  Hartford upon the tryall of John Carrington and his wife 20th Feb., 1662\"  (See _Rec. P.C._, 2: 17): Edw. Hopkins Esqr., Gournor John Haynes Esqr.  Deputy, Mr. Wells, Mr. Woolcott, Mr. Webster, Mr. Cullick, Mr. Clarke.    This court had jurisdiction over misdemeanors, and was \"aided by a  jury,\" as a close student of colonial history, the late Sherman W.  Adams, quaintly says in one of his historical papers. These were the  jurymen:      Mr. Phelps           John White            John More    Mr. Tailecoat        Will Leawis           Edw. Griswold    Mr. Hollister        Sam. Smith            Steph. Harte    Daniel Milton        John Pratt            Theo. Judd    Before this tribunal--representative of the others doing like service  later--made up of the foremost citizens, and of men in the ordinary  walks of life, endowed with hard common sense and presumably inspired  with a spirit of justice and fair play, came John Carrington and his  wife Joan of Wethersfield, against whom the jury brought in a verdict of  guilty.    It must be clearly borne in mind that all these men, in this as in all  the other witchcraft"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12293"],[0,"Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine (#7)"],[1,"s, and pig  with sage stuffing (from which it was but one step to duck). More  than one species of \"galantine\" was already known; and I observe the  distinction, in one of the smaller collections printed by Warner,  between the tartlet formed of meat and the tartlet _de fritures_,  of which the latter approaches more nearly our notion. The imperfect  comprehension of harmonies, which is illustrated by the prehistoric  bag-pudding of King Arthur, still continued in the unnatural union of  flesh with sweets. It is now confined to the cottage, whence Arthur  may have himself introduced it at Court and to the Knights of the  Round Table.    In this authority, several of the dishes were to be cooked in _white  grease_, which Warner interprets into _lard_; others demanded olive  oil; but there is no allusion to butter. Among the receipts are  some for dishes \"in gravy\"; rabbits and chickens were to be treated  similarly; and the gravy appears to have consisted merely of the  broth in which they were boiled, and which was flavoured with pounded  almonds, powdered ginger, and sugar.    The \"Liber Cure Cocorum,\" which is apparently extant only in a  fifteenth century MS., is a metrical treatise, instructing its  readers how to prepare certain dishes, condiments and accessories; and  presents, for the most part, a repetition of what has already occurred  in earlier and more comprehensive undertakings. It is a curious aid  to our knowledge of the manner in which the table of the well-to-do  Englishman was furnished in the time of Henry VI., and it is so far  special, that it deals with the subject more from a middle-class point  of view than the \"Regulations for the Royal Household,\" and other  similar compilations, which I have to bring under notice. The names,  as usual, are often misleading, as in _blanc manger_, which is very  different from our _blanc-mange_; and the receipt for \"goose in a hog  pot\" leaves one in doubt as to its adaptability to the modern  palate. The poetical ambition of the author has proved a source of  embarrassment here and there; and in the receipt \"for a service on a  fish-day\" the practitioner is prayed within four lines to cover his  white herring for God's sake, and lay mustard over his red for God's  love, because _sake_ and _love_ rhyme with _take_ and _above_.    The next collection of receipts, which exists in a complete and  homogeneous shape, is the \"Noble Book of Cookery,\" of which an early  MS. copy at Holkham was edited in 1882 by Mrs. Napier, but which  had already been printed by Pynson in 1500, and subsequently by  his successor, John Byddell. This interesting and important volume  commences with a series of descriptions of certain royal and noble  entertainments given on various occasions from the time of Henry  IV. to that of Edward IV., and then proceeds to furnish a series  of directions for the cook of a king's or prince's household; for,  although both at the outset and the conclusion we are told that these  dishes were calculated for all estates, it is abundantly obvious that  they were such as never then, or very long subsequently, reached much  lower than the court or the aristocracy. There is a less complete copy  here of the feast at the enthronement of Archbishop Nevile. I regret  that neither of the old printed copies is at present accessible. That  of 1500 was formerly in the library at Bulstrode, and I was given by  the late Mr. Bradshaw to understand that the same copy (no other  being known) is probably at Longleat. By referring to Herbert's  \"Typographical Antiquities,\" anyone may see that, if his account (so  far as it goes) is to be trusted, the printed copy varies from the  Holkham MS. in many verbal particulars, and gives the date of Nevile's  Feast as 1465.    The compilation usually known as the \"Book of St. Albans,\" 1486, is,  perhaps, next to the \"Noble Book of Cookery,\" the oldest receptacle  for information on the subject in hand. The former, however, deals  with cookery only in an incidental and special way. Like Arnold's  Chronicle, the St. Albans volume is a miscellany comprehending nearly  all the matters that were apt to interest the few educated persons  who were qualified to peruse its pages; and amid a variety of allied  topics we come here across a catalogue of terms used in speaking of  certain dishes of that day. The reference is to the prevailing methods  of dressing and carving. A deer was said to be broken, a cony unlaced,  a pheasant, partridge, or quail winged, a pigeon or a woodcock  thighed, a plover minced, a mallard unbraced. They spoke of a salmon  or a gurnard as chined, a sole as loined, a haddock as sided, an eel  as trousoned, a pike as splatted, and a trout as gobbeted.    It must, I think, be predicated of Tusser's \"Husbandry,\" of which the  last edition published in the writer's lifetime is that of 1580, that  it seems rather to reproduce precepts which occur elsewhere than to  supply the reader with the fruits of his own direct observation. But  there are certain points in it which are curious and original. He  tells the ploughman that, after confession on Shrove Tuesday, he may  go and thresh the fat hen, and if he is blindfold, kill her, and then  dine on fritters and pancakes. At other times, seed-cakes, wafers, and  other light confections.    It appears to have been usual for the farmer at that date to allow his  hinds roast meat twice a week, on Sundays and on Thursday nights; but  perhaps this was a generous extreme, as Tusser is unusually liberal in  his ideas.    Tobias Venner, a Somersetshire man, brought out in 1620 his \"Via Recta  ad Vitam Longam.\" He was evidently a very intelligent person, and  affords us the result of his professional experience and personal  observation. He considered two meals a day sufficient for all  ordinary people,--breakfast at eleven and supper at six (as at the  universities); but he thought that children and the aged or infirm  could not be tied by any rule. He condemns \"bull's beef\" as rank,  unpleasant, and indigestible, and holds it best for the labourer;  which seems to indicate more than anything else the low state of  knowledge in the grazier, when Venner wrote: but there is something  beyond friendly counsel where our author dissuades the poor from  eating partridges, because they are calculated to promote asthma.  \"Wherefore,\" he ingenuously says, \"when they shall chance to meet with  a covey of young partridges, they were much better to bestow them upon  such, for whom they are convenient!\"    Salmon, turbot, and sturgeon he also reckoned hard of digestion, and  injurious, if taken to excess; nor does he approve of herrings and  sprats; and anchovies he characterises as the meat of drunkards. It is  the first that we have heard of them.    He was not a bad judge of what was palatable, and prescribes as an  agreeable and wholesome meal a couple of poached eggs with a little  salt and vinegar, and a few corns of pepper, some bread and butter,  and a draught of pure claret. He gives a receipt--the earliest I have  seen in print--for making metheglin or hydromel. He does not object  to furmety or junket, or indeed to custards, if they are eaten at  the proper seasons, and in the middle or at the end of meals. But he  dislikes mushrooms, and advises you to wash out your mouth, and rub  your teeth and gums with a dry cloth, after drinking milk.    The potato, however, he praises as nutritious and pleasant to the  taste, yet, as Gerarde the herbalist also says, flatulent. Venner  refers to a mode of sopping them in wine as existing in his time. They  were sometimes roasted in the embers, and there were other ways of  dressing them. John Forster, of Hanlop, in Bucks, wrote a pamphlet in  1664 to shew that the more extended cultivation of this root would be  a great national benefit.    Venner, who practised in the spring and autumn at Bath as a physician,  had no relish for the poorer classes, who did not fare well at the  hands of their superiors in any sense in the excellent old days. But  he liked the Quality, in which he embraced the Universities, and he  tenders them, among other little hints, the information that green  ginger was good for the memory, and conserve of roses (not the salad  of roses immortalised by Apuleius) was a capital posset against  bed-time. \"A conserve of rosemary and sage,\" says he, \"to be often  used by students, especially mornings fasting, doth greatly delight  the brain.\"    The military ascendency of Spain did not fail to influence the  culinary civilisation of those countries to which it temporarily  extended its rule; and in a Venetian work entitled \"Epulario, or the  Italian Banquet,\" printed in 1549, we recognise the Spanish tone which  had in the sixteenth century communicated itself to the cookery of the  Peninsula, shewing that Charles V. and his son carried at least one  art with them as an indemnity for the havoc which they committed.    The nursery rhyme of \"Sing a song of sixpence\" receives a singular and  diverting illustration from the pages of this \"Epulario,\" where occurs  a receipt \"to make Pies that the Birds may be alive in them, and fly  out when it is cut up.\" Some of the other more salient beads relate  to the mode of dressing sundry dishes in the Roman and Catalonian  fashion, and teach us how to seethe gourds, as they did in Spain, and  to make mustard after the manner of Padua.
