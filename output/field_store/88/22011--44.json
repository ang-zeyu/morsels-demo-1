Still they are worth  reading, although of a different character to the scenes, or as a wag would  say, the \"concerted pieces\" which we have quoted from the three previous  volumes. Our present quotations will not therefore possess the interest of  complicated schemes.    At page 34, Vidocq awards to our metropolis, no very desirable  distinction--      _Town and Country Thieves._      \"No capital in the world, London excepted, has within it so many thieves as  Paris. The pavement of the modern Lutetia is incessantly trodden by rogues.  It is not surprising; for the facility of hiding them in the crowd makes  all that are badly disposed resort thither, whether French or foreign. The  greater number are fixed constantly in this vast city; some only come like  birds of passage, at the approach of great occasions, or during the summer  season. Besides these exotics, there are indigenous plants, which make a  fraction in the population, of which the denominator is tolerably high. I  leave to the great calculator, M. Charles Dupin, the task of enumerating  them in decimals, and telling us if the sum that it amounts to should not  be taken into consideration in the application of the black list.\"      _False Keys._      \"Cambrioleurs are plunderers of rooms, either by force or with false keys.  There are of this class thieves of incredible effrontery; that of one  Beaumont almost surpasses belief. Escaped from the Bagne at Rochefort,  where he was sentenced to pass twelve years of his life, he came to Paris,  and scarcely had he arrived there, where he had already practised, when, by  way of getting his hand in, he committed several trifling robberies, and  when by these preliminary steps he had proceeded to exploits more worthy of  his ancient renown, he conceived the project of stealing a treasure. No one  will imagine that this treasure was that of the _Bureau Central_ (Central  Office), now the Prefecture of Police! It was already pretty difficult to  procure impressions of the keys, but he achieved this first difficulty, and  soon had in his possession all the means of effecting an opening; but to  open was nothing, it was necessary to open without being perceived, to  introduce himself without fear of being disturbed, to work without  witnesses, and go out again freely. Beaumont, who had calculated all the  difficulties that opposed him, was not dismayed. He had remarked that the  private room of the chief officer, M. Henri, was nigh to the spot where he  proposed to effect his entrance; he espied the propitious moment, and  wished sincerely that some circumstance would call away so dangerous a  neighbour for some time, and chance was subservient to his wishes.\"    \"One morning, M. Henri was obliged to go out. Beaumont, sure that he would  not return that day, ran to his house, put on a black coat, and in that  costume, which, in those days, always announced a magistrate, or public  functionary, presents himself at the entrance of the _Bureau Central_. The  officer to whom he addressed himself supposed, of course, that he was at  least a commissary. On the invitation of Beaumont, he gave him a soldier,  whom he placed as sentinel at the entrance to the narrow passage which  leads to the depot, and commanded not to allow any person to pass. No  better expedient could be found for preventing surprise. Thus Beaumont, in  the midst of a crowd of valuable objects, could, at his leisure, and in  perfect security, choose what best pleased him; watches, jewels, diamonds,  precious stones, &c. He chose those which he deemed most valuable, most  portable, and as soon as he had made his selection, he dismissed the  sentinel, and disappeared.\"    \"This robbery could not be long concealed, and the following day was  discovered. Had thunder fallen on the police, they would have been less  astonished than at this event. To penetrate to the very sanctuary!--the  holy of holies! The fact appeared so very extraordinary, that it was  doubted. Yet it was evident that a robbery had taken place, and to whom was  it to be attributed? All the suspicions fell on the clerks; sometimes on  one, sometimes on another; when Beaumont, betrayed by a friend, was  apprehended, and sentenced a second time.\"    \"The robbery he had committed might be estimated at some hundred thousand  francs, the greater part of which were found on him.\"    \"'There was wherewithal,' he said, 'to become an honest man; I should have  become so; it is so easy when rich! yet how many rich men are only  scoundrels!'\"    \"These words were the only ones he uttered, when he was apprehended. This  surprising thief was conducted to Brest; where, after half a dozen escapes,  which only served to make his subsequent confinement more rigorous, he died  in a frightful state of exhaustion.\"    \"Beaumont enjoyed amongst his confraternity a colossal reputation; and even  now, when a rogue boasts of his lofty exploits--'Hold your tongue,' they  say, 'you are not worthy to untie the shoe-strings of Beaumont!'\"    \"In effect, to have robbed the police was the height of address. Is not a  robbery of this nature the _chef-d'oeuvre_ of its kind, and can it do  otherwise than, make its perpetrator a hero in the eyes of his admirers?  Who should dare to compare with him? Beaumont had robbed the police! Hang  yourself, brave Crillon! hang yourself, Coignard! hang yourself,  Pertruisard! hang yourself, Callet!--to him, you are but of Saint-Jean.  What is it to have robbed states of service? To have carried off the  treasure of the army of the Rhine? To have carried off the military  chest?--Beaumont had robbed the police! Hang yourselves!--or go to England,  they will hang you there.\"      _The Misanthropic Swindler._      At page 71, Vidocq tells us a strange story of a fellow named Capdeville,  who affecting misanthropy and disgust of the world, hired an apartment at a  lone house near Paris, and employed his solitude in obtaining false keys of  all the other rooms. Not quite settled here, \"Capdeville published his  intention of going out to discover an hermitage where he could pass his  latter days in peace. He inquired of all the country proprietors who had  places for sale within a circuit of six leagues, and it was soon known  through the country that he was on the look-out for a place of the kind.  Every body knew, of course, something that would suit him, but he would  have only a patrimonial estate. 'Well, well,' said they, 'since he is so  scrupulous, let him look out for himself.' This, in fact, he did.\"    \"Determined to make a tour, to examine what was most likely to suit him, he  employed himself ostensibly in preparations for his departure; he was only  to be absent three or four days, but before he departed, he was anxious to  know if there was no danger in leaving a secretary, in which were ten  thousand francs, which he did not wish to take with him. Being assured on  this point, and full of security, he did not hesitate to set out on his  proposed journey.\"    \"Capdeville did not go to a very great distance. During his sojourn in the  house he had just left, he had had time to take impressions of all the keys  which were requisite for his entrance into the dwelling of the landlord,  who he knew was in the habit of dining in Paris, and did not return very  early in the evening. By being there at dusk, Capdeville was certain of  having before him all the time necessary for carrying on his operations.  The sun had set, and, favoured by the darkness, he passed unperceived  through Belleville, and having entered the house by the help of false keys,  he entered the abode of the landlord, which he cleared out even to the  linen.\"    \"Towards the end of the fifth day they began to be uneasy at the  non-appearance of the misanthrope; the next day a suspicion arose.  Twenty-four hours later, and there was but one opinion respecting him; he  was the thief. After such a trick mistrust all misanthropes. To whom then  shall we trust, in whom place confidence? In philanthropists? By no means.\"    The misanthropy in this case must have been infectious, and the disgust of  the lodger transferred to the landlord.    Other novelties oblige us to break off here for the present, so that  another spice or two of the frauds of Paris stand over for our next.           *       *       *       *       *        THE ANECDOTE GALLERY           *       *       *       *       *      RECOLLECTIONS OF PALEY.    _From Best's Personal Memorials._      Some one came up to Paley and made an excuse for a friend, who was obliged  to defer an intended visit to the subdeanery, because a man who had  promised to pay him some money in April, could not pay it till May. \"A  common case,\" said Paley. We all laughed. Paley, by way of rewarding us for  our complaisance in being pleased with what was recommended chiefly by the  quaintness of his manner, went on:--\"A man should never _paay mooney_ till  he can't help it; _soomething maay_ happen.\"    At another time he said, \"I always desire my wife and daughters to pay  ready money. It is of no use to desire them to buy only what they want;  they will always imagine they want what they wish to buy; but that paying  ready _mooney_ is such a check upon their imagin_aa_tion.\"    Paley's education had been sufficiently hardy. \"My father rode to  Peterborough, and I rode after him, on a horse that I could not manage. I  tumbled off. My father, without looking back, cried out, 'Get up again,  Will.' When I set up a carriage, it was thought right that my armorial  bearings should appear on the panels. Now, we had none of us ever heard of  the Paley arms; none of us had ever dreamed that such things existed, or  had ever been. All the old folks of the family were consulted; they knew  nothing about it. Great search was made, however, and at last we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#7)"],[1,"form in  front, so Barker scribbled in the fly-leaf of his book, \"Please send us  your Homer crib,\" and got the book passed on to Llewellyn, who  immediately shoved his crib in Barker's direction. The only danger of  the transaction being noticed, was when the book was being handed from  one bench to another, and as Eric unluckily had an end seat, he had got  into trouble more than once.    On this occasion, just as Graham, the last boy on the form in front,  handed Eric the crib, Mr. Gordon happened to look up, and Eric, very  naturally anxious to screen another from trouble, popped the book under  his own Homer.    \"Williams, what are you doing?\"    \"Nothing, Sir,\" said Eric, looking up innocently.    \"Bring me that book under your Homer.\"    Eric blushed, hesitated--but at last, amid a dead silence, took up the  book. Mr. Gordon looked at it for a moment, let it fall on the ground,  and then, with an unnecessary affectation of disgust, took it up with  the tongs, and dropped it into the fire. There was a titter round  the room.    \"Silence,\" thundered the master; \"this is no matter for laughing. So,  sir, _this_ is the way you get up to the top of the form?\"    \"I wasn't using it, sir,\" said Eric.    \"Not using it! Why, I saw you put it, open, under your Homer.\"    \"It isn't mine, sir.\"    \"Then whose is it?\" Mr. Gordon looked at the fly leaf, but of course no  name was there; in those days it was dangerous to write one's name in a  translation.    Eric was silent.    \"Under the circumstances, Williams, I must punish you,\" said Mr. Gordon.  \"Of course I am _bound_ to believe you, but the circumstances are very  suspicious. You had no business with such a book at all. Hold out  your hand.\"    As yet, Eric had never been caned. It would have been easy for him in  this case to clear himself without mentioning names, but (very rightly)  he thought it unmanly to clamor about being punished, and he felt  nettled at Mr. Gordon's merely official belief of his word. He knew that  he had his faults, but certainly want of honor was not among them.  Indeed, there were only three boys out of the twenty in the form, who  did not resort to modes of unfairness far worse than the use of cribs,  and those three were Russell, Owen, and himself; even Duncan, even  Montagu, inured to it by custom, were not ashamed to read their lesson  off a concealed book, or copy a date from a furtive piece of paper. They  would have been ashamed of it before they came to Roslyn school, but the  commonness of the habit had now made them blind or indifferent to its  meanness. It was peculiarly bad in the fourth form, because the master  treated them with implicit confidence, and being scrupulously honorable  himself, was unsuspicious of others. He was therefore extremely  indignant at this apparent discovery of an attempt to overreach him in  a boy so promising and so much of a favorite as Eric Williams.    \"Hold out your hand,\" he repeated.    Eric did so, and the cane tingled sharply across his palm. He could bear  the pain well enough, but he was keenly alive to the disgrace; he, a boy  at the head of his form, to be caned in this way by a man who didn't  understand him, and unjustly too! He mustered up an indifferent air,  closed his lips tight, and determined to give no further signs. The  defiance of his look made Mr. Gordon angry, and he inflicted in  succession five hard cuts on either hand, each one of which, was more  excruciating than the last.    \"Now, go to your seat.\"    Eric did go to his seat, with all his bad passions roused, and he walked  in a jaunty and defiant kind of way that made the master really grieve  at the disgrace into which he had fallen. But he instantly became a hero  with the form, who unanimously called him a great brick for not telling,  and admired him immensely for bearing up without crying under so severe  a punishment. The punishment _was_ most severe, and for some weeks after  there were dark weals visible across Eric's palm, which rendered the use  of his hands painful.    \"Poor Williams,\" said Duncan, as they went out of school, \"how very  plucky of you not to cry.\"         \"Vengeance deep brooding o'er the _cane_,         Had locked the source of softer woe;       And burning pride, and high disdain,         Forbade the gentler tear to flow,\"    said Eric, with a smile.    But he only bore up until he got home, and there, while he was telling  his father the occurrence, he burst into a storm of passionate tears,  mingled with the fiercest invectives against Mr. Gordon for his  injustice.    \"Never mind, Eric,\" said his father; \"only take care that you never get  a punishment _justly_, and I shall always be as proud of you as I am  now. And don't cherish this resentment, my boy; it will only do you  harm. Try to forgive and forget.\"    \"But, Papa, Mr. Gordon is so hasty. I have indeed been rather a favorite  of his, yet now he shows that he has no confidence in me. It is a great  shame that he shouldn't believe my word. I don't mind the pain; but I  shan't like him any more, and I'm sure, now, I shan't get the  examination prize.\"    \"You don't mean, Eric, that he will be influenced by partiality in the  matter?\"    \"No, Papa, not exactly; at least I dare say he won't _intend_ to be. But  it is unlucky to be on bad terms with a master, and I know I shan't  work so well.\"    On the whole, the boy was right in thinking this incident a misfortune.  Although he had nothing particular for which to blame himself, yet the  affair had increased his pride, while it lowered his self-respect; and  he had an indistinct consciousness that the popularity in his form would  do him as much harm as the change of feeling in his master. He grew  careless and dispirited, nor was it till in the very heat of the final  competition, that he felt his energies fully revived.    Half the form were as eager about the examination as the other half  were indifferent; but none were more eager than Eric. He was much  hindered by Barker's unceasing attempt to copy his papers  surreptitiously; and very much disgusted at the shameless way in which  many of the boys \"cribbed\" from books, and from each other, or used torn  leaves concealed in their sleeves, or dates written on their wristbands,  and on their nails. He saw how easily much of this might have been  prevented; but Mr. Gordon was fresh at his work, and had not yet learnt  the practical lesson, that to trust young boys to any great extent, is  really to increase their temptations. He _did_ learn the lesson  afterwards, and then almost entirely suppressed the practice, partly by  increased vigilance, and partly by forbidding _any_ book to be brought  into the room during the time of examination. But meanwhile, much evil  had been done by the habitual abuse of his former confidence.    I shall not linger over the examination. At its close, the day before  the breaking-up, the list was posted on the door of the great  school-room, and most boys made an impetuous rush to see the result. But  Eric was too nervous to be present at the hour when this was usually  done, and he had asked Russell to bring him the news.    He was walking up and down the garden, counting the number of steps he  took, counting the number of shrubs along each path, and devising every  sort of means to beguile the time, when he heard hasty steps, and  Russell burst in at the back gate, breathless with haste, and bright  with excitement.    \"Hurrah! old fellow,\" he cried, seizing both Eric's hands; \"I never  felt so glad in my life;\" and he shook his friend's arms up and down,  laughing joyously.    \"Well! tell me,\" said Eric.    \"First, {Owen/Williams} Aequales,\" \"you've got head remove you see, in  spite of your forebodings, as I always said you would; and I  congratulate you with all my heart.\"    \"No?\" said Eric, \"have I really?--you're not joking? Oh! hurrah!--I must  rush in and tell them;\" and he bounded off.    In a second he was back at Russell's side. \"What a selfish animal I am!  Where are you placed, Russell?\"    \"Oh! magnificent; I'm third;--far higher than I expected.\"    \"I'm so glad,\" said Eric. \"Come in with me and tell them. I'm head  remove, mother,\" he shouted, springing into the parlor where his father  and mother sat.    In the lively joy that this announcement excited, Russell stood by for  the moment unheeded; and when Eric took him by the hand to tell them  that he was third, he hung his head, and a tear was in his eye.    \"Poor boy! I'm afraid you're disappointed,\" said Mrs. Williams kindly,  drawing him to her side.    \"Oh no, no! it's not _that_,\" said Russell, hastily, as he lifted his  swimming eyes towards her face.    \"Are you hurt, Russell?\" asked Eric, surprised.    \"Oh! no; don't ask me; I am only foolish to-day;\" and with a burst of  sorrow he flung his arms round Mrs. Williams' neck. She folded him to  her heart, and kissed him tenderly; and when his sobs would let him  speak, he whispered to her in a low tone, \"It is but a year since I  became an orphan.\"    \"Dearest child,\" she said, \"look on me as a mother; I love you very  dearly for your own sake as well as Eric's.\"    Gradually he grew calmer. They made him stay to dinner and spend the  rest of the day there, and by the evening he had recovered all his usual  sprightliness. Towards sunset he and Eric went for a stroll down the  bay, and talked over the term and the examination.    They sat down on a green bank just beyond the beach, and watched the  tide come in, while the sea-distance was crimson with the glory of  evening. The beauty and the murmur filled them with a quiet happiness,  not untinged with the melancholy thought of parting the next day.    At last Eric broke the silence. \"Russell, let me always call you Edwin,  and call me Eric.\"    \"Very gladly, Eric. Your coming here has made me so happy.\" And the two  boys squeezed each other's hands, and looked into each other's faces,  and silently promised"]]]
