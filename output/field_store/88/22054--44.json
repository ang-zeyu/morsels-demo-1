You'll find us all changed since you vanished:      We've set up a National School,    And waltzing is utterly banished--      And Ellen has married a fool--    The Major is going to travel--      Miss Hyacinth threatens a rout--    The walk is laid down with fresh gravel--      Papa is laid up with the gout:    And Jane has gone on with her easels,      And Anne has gone off with Sir Paul;    And Fanny is sick of the measles,--      And I'll tell you the rest at the Ball.      You'll meet all your Beauties;--the Lily,      And the Fairy of Willowbrook Farm,    And Lucy, who made me so silly      At Dawlish, by taking your arm--    Miss Manners, who always abused you,      For talking so much about Hock--    And her sister who often amused you,      By raving of rebels and Rock;    And something which surely would answer,      A heiress, quite fresh from Bengal--    So, though you were seldom a dancer,      You'll dance, just for once, at our Ball.      But out on the world!--from the flowers      It shuts out the sunshine of truth;    It blights the green leaves in the bowers,      It makes an old age of our youth:    And the flow of our feeling, once in it,      Like a streamlet beginning to freeze,    Though it cannot turn ice in a minute,      Grows harder by sullen degrees--    Time treads o'er the grave of Affection;      Sweet honey is turned into gall.    Perhaps you have no recollection      That ever you danced at our Ball.      You once could be pleased with our ballads--      To-day you have critical ears:    You once could be charmed with our salads--      Alas! you've been dining with Peers--    You trifled and flirted with many---      You've forgotten the when and the how--    There was _one_ you liked better than any--      Perhaps you've forgotten _her_ now.    But of those you remember most newly,      Of those who delight or enthrall,    None love you a quarter so truly      As some you will find at our Ball.      They tell me you've many who flatter,      Because of your wit and your song--    They tell me (and what does it matter?)      You like to be praised by the throng--    They tell me you're shadowed with laurel,      They tell me you're loved by a Blue--    They tell me you're sadly immoral,      Dear Clarence, _that_ cannot be true!    But to me you are still what I found you      Before you grew clever and tall--    And you'll think of the spell that once bound you--      And you'll come--_won't_ you come?--to our Ball!                               _London Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      PARTY.

At the town of Pezenas they still show an elbow-chair of Moliere's (as at  Montpelier they show the gown of Rabelais,) in which the poet, it is  said, ensconced in a corner of a barber's shop, would sit for the hour  together, silently watching the air, gestures, and grimaces of the  village politicians, who, in those days, before coffee-houses were  introduced into France, used to congregate in this place of resort. The  fruits of this study may be easily discerned in those original draughts  of character from the middling and lower classes with which his pieces  everywhere abound.    Moliere's celebrated farce of _Les Precieuses Ridicules_; a piece in only  one act, but which, by its inimitable satire, effected such a revolution  in the literary taste of his countrymen, as has been accomplished by few  works of a more imposing form--may be considered as the basis of the  dramatic glory of Moliere, and the dawn of good comedy in France. The  satire aimed at a coterie of wits who set themselves up as arbiters of  taste and fashion, and was welcomed with enthusiastic applause, most of  them being present at the first exhibition, to behold the fine fabric,  which they had been so painfully constructing, brought to the ground by a  single blow. \"And these follies,\" said Menage to Chapelin, \"which you and  I see so finely criticised here, are what we have been so long admiring.  We must go home and burn our idols.\" \"Courage, Moliere,\" cried an old man  from the pit; \"this is genuine comedy.\" The price of the seats was  doubled from the time of the second representation. Nor were the effects  of the satire merely transitory. It converted an epithet of praise into  one of reproach; and a _femme precieuse_, a _style precieux_, a _ton  precieux_, once so much admired, have ever since been used only to  signify the most ridiculous affectation. There was, in truth, however,  quite as much luck as merit, in this success of Moliere; whose production  exhibits no finer raillery, or better sustained dialogue, than are to be  found in many of his subsequent pieces. It assured him, however, of his  own strength, and disclosed to him the mode in which he should best hit  the popular taste. \"I have no occasion to study Plautus or Terence any  longer,\" said he, \"I must henceforth, study the world.\" The world  accordingly was his study; and the exquisite models of character which it  furnished him, will last as long as it shall endure.    Though an habitual valetudinarian, Moliere relied almost wholly on the  temperance of his diet for the reestablishment of his health. \"What use  do you make of your physician?\" said the king to him one day. \"We chat  together, Sire,\" said the poet. \"He gives me his prescriptions; I never  follow them; and so I get well.\"    In Moliere's time, the profession of a comedian was but lightly esteemed  in France at this period. Moliere experienced the inconveniences  resulting from this circumstance, even after his splendid literary career  had given him undoubted claims to consideration. Most of our readers no  doubt, are acquainted with the anecdote of Belloc, an agreeable poet of  the court, who, on hearing one of the servants in the royal household  refuse to aid the author of the _Tartuffe_ in making the king's bed,  courteously requested \"the poet to accept his services for that purpose.\"  Madame Campan's anecdote of a similar courtesy, on the part of Louis the  Fourteenth, is also well known; who, when several of these functionaries  refused to sit at table with the comedian, kindly invited him to sit down  with him, and, calling in some of his principal courtiers, remarked that  \"he had requested the pleasure of Moliere's company at his own table, as  it was not thought quite good enough for his officers.\" This rebuke had  the desired effect.    Moliere died in 1673, he had been long affected by a pulmonary complaint,  and it was only by severe temperance that he was enabled to preserve even  a moderate degree of health. At the commencement of the year, his malady  sensibly increased. At this very season, he composed his _Malade  Imaginaire_; the most whimsical, and perhaps the most amusing of the  compositions, in which he has indulged his raillery against the faculty.  On the 17th of February, being the day appointed for its fourth  representation, his friends would have dissuaded him from appearing, in  consequence of his increasing indisposition. But he persisted in his  design, alleging \"that more than fifty poor individuals depended for  their daily bread on its performance.\" His life fell a sacrifice to his  benevolence. The exertions which he was compelled to make in playing the  principal part of _Argan_ aggravated his distemper, and as he was  repeating the word _juro_, in the concluding ceremony, he fell into a  convulsion, which he vainly endeavoured to disguise from the spectators  under a forced smile. He was immediately carried to his house, in the  _Rue de Richelieu_, now No. 34. A violent fit of coughing, on his  arrival, occasioned the rupture of a blood-vessel; and seeing his end  approaching, he sent for two ecclesiastics of the parish of St. Eustace,  to which he belonged, to administer to him the last offices of religion.  But these worthy persons having refused their assistance, before a third,  who had been sent for, could arrive, Moliere, suffocated with the  effusion of blood, had expired in the arms of his family.    Moliere died soon after entering upon his fifty-second year. He is  represented to have been somewhat above the middle stature, and well  proportioned; his features large, his complexion dark, and his black,  bushy eye-brows so flexible, as to admit of his giving an infinitely  comic expression to his physiognomy. He was the best actor of his own  generation, and by his counsels, formed the celebrated Baron, the best of  the succeeding. He played all the range of his own characters, from  _Alceste_ to _Sganarelle_; though he seems to have been peculiarly fitted  for broad comedy.    He produced all his pieces, amounting to thirty, in the short space of  fifteen years. He was in the habit of reading these to an old female  domestic, by the name of La Foret; on whose unsophisticated judgment he  greatly relied. On one occasion when he attempted to impose upon her the  production of a brother author, she plainly told him that he had never  written it. Sir Walter Scott may have had this habit of Moliere's in his  mind, when he introduced a similar expedient into his \"Chronicles of the  Canongate.\" For the same reason, our poet used to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12902"],[0,"A Textbook of Theosophy (#7)"],[1,"this Third Outpouring leaps down to meet it,  and in the higher mental world is formed an ego, a permanent  individuality--permanent, that is, until, far later in his evolution, the  man transcends it and reaches back to the divine unity from which he came.  To make this ego, the fragment of the group-soul (which has hitherto played  the part always of ensouling force) becomes in its turn a vehicle, and is  itself ensouled by that divine Spark which has fallen into it from on high.  That Spark may be said to have been hovering in the monadic world over the  group-soul through the whole of its previous evolution, unable to effect a  junction with it until its corresponding fragment in the group-soul had  developed sufficiently to permit it. It is this breaking away from the rest  of the group-soul and developing a separate ego which marks the distinction  between the highest animal and the lowest man.          Chapter V    THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN      Man is therefore in essence a Spark of the divine Fire, belonging to the  monadic world.[1] To that Spark, dwelling all the time in that world, we  give the name \"Monad\". For the purposes of human evolution the Monad  manifests itself in lower worlds. When it descends one stage and enters the  spiritual world, it shows itself there as the triple Spirit having itself  three aspects (just as in worlds infinitely higher the Deity has His three  Aspects). Of those three one remains always in that world, and we call that  the Spirit in man. The second aspect manifests itself in the intuitional  world, and we speak of it as the Intuition in man. The third shows itself  in the higher mental world, and we call it the Intelligence in man. These  three aspects taken together constitute the ego which ensouls the fragment  from the group-soul. Thus man as we know him, though in reality a Monad  residing in the monadic world, shows himself as an ego in the higher mental  world, manifesting these three aspects of himself (Spirit, Intuition and  Intelligence) through that vehicle of higher mental matter which we name  the causal body.    Footnote 1: The President has now decided upon a set of names for the  planes, so for the future these will be used instead of those previously  employed. A table of them is given below for reference.    NEW NAMES                       OLD NAMES  1. Divine World                 Adi Plane  2. Monadic World                Anupadaka Plane  3.

Physical World               Physical Plane    These will supersede the names given in Vol. II of _The Inner Life._    This ego is the man during the human stage of evolution; he is the nearest  correspondence, in fact, to the ordinary unscientific conception of the  soul. He lives unchanged (except for his growth) from the moment of  individualization until humanity is transcended and merged into divinity.  He is in no way affected by what we call birth and death; what we commonly  consider as his life is only a day in his life. The body which we can see,  the body which is born and dies, is a garment which he puts on for the  purposes of a certain part of his evolution.    Nor is it the only body which he assumes. Before he, the ego in the higher  mental world, can take a vehicle belonging to the physical world, he must  make a connection with it through the lower mental and astral worlds. When  he wishes to descend he draws around himself a veil of the matter of the  lower mental world, which we call his mental body. This is the instrument  by means of which he thinks all his concrete thoughts--abstract thought  being a power of the ego himself in the higher mental world.    Next he draws round himself a veil of astral matter, which we call his  astral body; and that is the instrument of his passions and emotions, and  also (in conjunction with the lower part of his mental body) the  instrument of all such thought as is tinged by selfishness and personal  feeling. Only after having assumed these intermediate vehicles can he come  into touch with a baby physical body, and be born into the world which we  know. He lives through what we call his life, gaining certain qualities as  the result of its experiences; and at its end, when the physical body is  worn out, he reverses the process of descent and lays aside one by one the  temporary vehicles which he has assumed. The first to go is the physical  body, and when that is dropped, his life is centred in the astral world and  he lives in his astral body.    The length of his stay in that world depends upon the amount of passion and  emotion which he has developed within himself in his physical life. If  there is much of these, the astral body is strongly vitalized, and will  persist for a long time; if there is but little, the astral body has less  vitality, and he will soon be able to cast that vehicle aside in turn. When  that is done he finds himself living in his mental body. The strength of  that depends upon the nature of the thoughts to which he has habituated  himself, and usually his stay at this level is a long one. At last it comes  to an end, and he casts aside the mental body in turn, and is once more the  ego in his own world.    Owing to lack of development, he is as yet but partially conscious in that  world; the vibrations of its matter are too rapid to make any impression  upon him, just as the ultra-violet rays are too rapid to make any  impression upon our eyes. After a rest there, he feels the desire to  descend to a level where the undulations are perceptible to him, in order  that he may feel himself to be fully alive; so he repeats the process of  descent into denser matter, and assumes once more a mental, an astral and a  physical body. As his previous bodies have all disintegrated, each in its  tarn, these new vehicles are entirely distinct from them, and thus it  happens that in his physical life he has no recollection whatever of other  similar lives which have preceded it.    When functioning in this physical world he remembers by means of his mental  body; but since that is a new one, assumed only for this birth, it  naturally cannot contain the memory of previous births in which it had no  part. The man himself, the ego, does remember them all when in his own  world, and occasionally some partial recollection of them or influence from  them filters through into his lower vehicles. He does not usually, in his  physical life, remember the experiences of earlier lives, but he does  manifest in physical life the qualities which those experiences have  developed in him. Each man is therefore exactly what he has made himself  during those past lives; if he has in them developed good qualities in  himself, he possesses the good qualities now; if he neglected to train  himself, and consequently left himself weak and of evil disposition, he  finds himself precisely in that condition now. The qualities, good or evil,  with which he is born are those which he has made for himself.    This development of the ego is the object of the whole process of  materialization; he assumes those veils of matter precisely because through  them he is able to receive vibrations to which he can respond, so that his  latent faculties may thereby be unfolded. Though man descends from on high  into these lower worlds, it is only through that descent that a full  cognizance of the higher worlds is developed in him. Full consciousness in  any given world involves the power to perceive and respond to all the  undulations of that world: therefore the ordinary man has not yet perfect  consciousness at any level--not even in this physical world which he thinks  he knows. It is possible for him to unfold his percipience in all these  worlds, and it is by means of such developed consciousness that we observe  all these facts which I am now describing.    The causal body is the permanent vehicle of the ego in the higher mental  world. It consists of matter of the first, second and third subdivisions of  that world. In ordinary people it is not yet fully active, only that matter  which belongs to the third subdivision being vivified. As the ego unfolds  his latent possibilities through the long course of his evolution, the  higher matter is gradually brought into action, but it is only in the  perfected man whom we call the Adept that it is developed to its fullest  extent. Such matter can be discerned by clairvoyant sight, but only by a  seer who knows how to use the sight of the ego.    It is difficult to describe a causal body fully, because the senses  belonging to its world are altogether different from and higher than ours  at this level. Such memory of the appearance of a causal body as it is  possible for a clairvoyant to bring into his physical brain represents it  as ovoid, and as surrounding the physical body of the man, extending to a  distance of about eighteen inches from the normal surface of that body. In  the case of primitive man it resembles a bubble, and gives the impression  of being empty. It is in reality filled with higher mental matter, but as  this is not yet brought into activity it remains colourless and  transparent. As advancement continues it is gradually stirred into  alertness by vibrations which reach it from the lower bodies. This comes  but slowly, because the activities of man in the earlier stages of his  evolution are not of a character to obtain expression in matter so fine as  that of the higher mental body; but when a man reaches the stage where he  is capable either of abstract thought or of unselfish emotion the matter of  the causal body is aroused into response.    When these rates of undulation are awakened within him they show themselves  in his causal body as colours, so that instead of being a mere transparent  bubble"]]]
