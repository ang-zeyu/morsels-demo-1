CHAPTER IV    VEGETABLES      It is practical to can all vegetables, even such difficult ones as  corn, peas and beans, by the cold-pack method of canning without using  any preservatives, if you will follow all directions, instructions and  the time-table accurately. Vegetable canning is a little more  complicated than fruit canning.      TOMATOES    Every one likes canned tomatoes. In many homes more tomatoes are  canned than any other product. The housewife uses them for soups, for  sauces and for seasoning many meat dishes. Some women say: \"I can  preserve everything but tomatoes. They always spoil. What do I do  wrong?\" If the following directions are followed tomatoes will not  spoil.    Tomatoes really are the easiest vegetable to can, because the period  of sterilization is short, and many jars may be canned in a day, or if  one is very busy a few jars may be canned daily without the  expenditure of a great deal of time.    The best tomatoes for canning are those of moderate size, smooth and  uniformly ripe. When a tomato ripens unevenly or when it is misshapen,  it is difficult to peel, and the percentage of waste is high. Tomatoes  should not be picked when they are green or partly ripe, for the  flavor will not be so good as when they are allowed to remain upon  the vines until fully ripe. Care should be taken, however, not to  allow them to become overripe before canning.    In no instance should a tomato with a rotten spot be canned, even  though the spot is cut out, for the occasional spoiled jar resulting  from this attempted saving will cost more than the partly spoiled  tomatoes are worth. If the housewife will can only uniformly ripe,  sound tomatoes, saving the small, uneven but sound fruit for tomato  _puree_, she will have a much better-looking pack and greater food  value at the close of the season. Yellow tomatoes may be canned in the  same manner as are the more common red varieties, except that it is  not necessary to remove the cores.    First of all, grade for ripeness, size and quality; this is to insure  a high-grade product. We could, of course, can different sizes and  shades together, but uniform products are more pleasing to the eye and  will sterilize much more evenly. If the products are of the same  ripeness and quality, the entire pack will receive the proper degree  of cooking.    Wash the tomatoes. Have ready a kettle of boiling water. Put the  tomatoes in a wire basket, or lay them on a piece of cheesecloth or a  towel, twist the ends together to form a sack, and let this down into  the kettle. It is a good plan to slip a rubber band round the neck of  this sack to hold the ends in place. The ends should be long enough to  stand up out of the water and so avoid danger of burning the fingers  when removing the product.    Have the water boiling hard. Lower the tomatoes into the boiling  water. This is called scalding the tomatoes. We scald the tomatoes to  loosen the skin. If the tomatoes are very ripe, one minute scalding  will be sufficient. The average length of time for tomatoes, just  perfect for canning, is one and a half minutes. Do not leave the  tomatoes in the hot water until the skins break, as this gives them a  fuzzy appearance.    The scalding kettle always should be covered, to keep in all the heat  possible. Begin to time from the minute the product is immersed in the  boiling water. If you wait until the water comes back to a boil, you  will scald the product too long and have mushy tomatoes.    Lift the tomatoes out of the hot water and plunge them immediately  into cold water, or hold them under the cold-water faucet. The  cold-dip makes them easier to handle, separates the skin from the  pulp, firms the texture, and coagulates the coloring matter so it  stays near the surface, giving them a rich, red color. Then the shock  due to the sudden change from hot to cold and back to hot again seems  to help kill the spores. Do not let the product stand in the cold-dip.  The water becomes lukewarm, softens the product and allows bacteria to  develop.    Take the tomato in the left hand and with a sharp knife cut out the  core. Be careful not to cut into the fleshy portion or seed cells, for  this will scatter the seeds and pulp through the liquid, injuring the  appearance of the product. Cut out the core before removing the skin,  for the skin will protect the pulp and there will be less danger of  breaking the tomato. If the tomatoes are ripe and have been scalded  properly, the skin can be slipped off with the fingers.    The jars, rubbers and tops should be ready. Glass jars should be hot,  so there will be no danger of breakage in setting them in the hot  water, and so they will not cool the water in the cooker below the  boiling point.    Pack the tomatoes whole, pressing and shaking them well down together,  but not using force enough to crush them.    Now we come to a point where tomatoes are different from most  vegetables. Beans, carrots, peas, and so on, have hot water added to  them. But as a large part of the tomato is water, no more is needed.  Another exception where no water is needed is with the \"greens  family.\" So with tomatoes we add no water, but add one teaspoonful of  salt and one teaspoonful of sugar, just for seasoning, to every quart  jar. I think that tomatoes always are improved by the addition of a  little sugar, but this is not necessary and can be omitted, as also  can be the salt.    The salt in canning does not act as a preservative, but as seasoning;  so if for any reason you forget the salt, do not be alarmed. Your  products will keep perfectly without the salt.      THE WAY TO SEAL    The products are in the hot jars now. The jars do not need to be full  in order to keep. If you were canning by the \"open-kettle\" method, the  air in the partly filled jar would not have been sterilized, and might  contain the bacteria which cause the product to ferment or mold. But  by the cold pack, the air in the can is sterilized while the product  is being sterilized; and if the can is closed immediately after  cooking, a single spoonful may be canned in a two-quart jar and the  product will keep indefinitely.    Place Rubber and Cover on Jar. Fit the rubber. Use good rubbers and  see that they lie flat and fit close up to the can. Put the covers in  place.    Do Not Seal Glass Jars Tight. If using screw-top jars screw each  cover down until it catches, then turn a quarter of a round back; or  screw down with the thumb and little finger, not using force but  stopping when the cover catches.    If using vacuum-seal jars put the cover on and the spring in place.  The spring will give enough to allow the steam to escape.    If using glass-top jars, with the patent wire snap, put the cover in  place, the wire over the top and the clamp up.    The cover on a glass jar must not be tight while processing, because  the air will expand when heated, and if the cover is not loose enough  to allow the steam to escape, the pressure may blow the rubber out or  break the jar.

Captain Marryat  belittled Miss Martineau, but in his six volumes proved himself less a  critic of America than an enemy of democracy. Answering a review of his  earlier volumes, published separately, he wrote in his concluding  volume: \"I candidly acknowledge that the reviewer is right in his  supposition; my great object has been to do serious injury to the cause  of democracy[17].\"    The fact was that British governing and intellectual classes were  suffering a recoil from the enthusiasms leading up to the step toward  democracy in the Reform of 1832. The electoral franchise was still  limited to a small minority of the population. Britain was still ruled  by her \"wise men\" of wealth and position. Meanwhile, however, just at  the moment when dominant Whig influence in England carried through that  step forward toward democratic institutions which Whigs had long lauded  in America, the latter country had progressed to manhood suffrage, or as  nearly all leading Englishmen, whether Whig or Tory, regarded it, had  plunged into the rule of the mob. The result was a rapid lessening in  Whig ruling-class expression of admiration for America, even before long  to the complete cessation of such admiration, and to assertions in Great  Britain that the Reform of 1832 was \"final,\" the last step toward  democracy which Britain could safely take. It is not strange that the  books and reviews of the period from 1830 to 1840, heavily stress the  dangers and crudity of American democracy. They were written for what  was now a nearly unanimous British reading public, fearful lest Radical  pressure for still further electoral reform should preach the example of  the United States.    Thus after 1832 the previous sympathy for America of one section of the  British governing class disappears. More--it is replaced by a critical,  if not openly hostile attitude. Soon, with the rapid development of the  power and wealth of the United States, governing-class England, of all  factions save the Radical, came to view America just as it would have  viewed any other rising nation, that is, as a problem to be studied for  its influence on British prosperity and power. Again, expressions in  print reflect the changes of British view--nowhere more clearly than in  travellers' books. After 1840, for nearly a decade, these are devoted,  not to American political institutions, but to studies, many of them  very careful ones, of American industry and governmental policy.    Buckingham, one-time member of Parliament, wrote nine volumes of such  description. His work is a storehouse of fact, useful to this day to the  American historical student[18]. George Combe, philosopher and  phrenologist, studied especially social institutions[19]. Joseph Sturge,  philanthropist and abolitionist, made a tour, under the guidance of the  poet Whittier, through the Northern and Eastern States[20].  Featherstonaugh, a scientist and civil engineer, described the Southern  slave states, in terms completely at variance with those of Sturge[21].  Kennedy, traveller in Texas, and later British consul at Galveston, and  Warburton, a traveller who came to the United States by way of Canada,  an unusual approach, were both frankly startled, the latter professedly  alarmed, at the evidences of power in America[22]. Amazed at the energy,  growth and prosperity of the country and alarmed at the anti-British  feeling he found in New York City, Warburton wrote that \"they  [Americans] only wait for matured power to apply the incendiary torch of  Republicanism to the nations of Europe[23].\" Soon after this was written  there began, in 1848, that great tide of Irish emigration to America  which heavily reinforced the anti-British attitude of the City of New  York, and largely changed its character.    Did books dilating upon the expanding power of America reflect British  public opinion, or did they create it? It is difficult to estimate such  matters. Certainly it is not uninteresting that these books coincided in  point of time with a British governmental attitude of opposition, though  on peaceful lines, to the development of American power, and to the  adoption to the point of faith, by British commercial classes, of free  trade as opposed to the American protective system. But governing  classes were not the British public, and to the great unenfranchised  mass, finding voice through the writings of a few leaders, the  prosperity of America made a powerful appeal. Radical democracy was  again beginning to make its plea in Britain. In 1849 there was published  a study of the United States, more careful and exact than any previous  to Bryce's great work, and lauding American political institutions. This  was Mackay's \"Western World,\" and that there was a public eager for such  estimate is evidenced by the fact that the book went through four  British editions in 1850[24]. At the end of the decade, then, there  appeared once more a vigorous champion of the cause of British  democracy, comparing the results of \"government by the wise\" with  alleged mob rule. Mackay wrote:         \"Society in America started from the point to which society       in Europe is only yet finding. The equality of men is, to       this moment, its corner-stone ... that which develops itself       as the sympathy of class, becomes in America the general       sentiment of society.... We present an imposing front to the       world; but let us tear the picture and look at the canvas.       One out of every seven of us is a pauper. Every six       Englishmen have, in addition to their other enormous burdens,       to support a seventh between them, whose life is spent in       consuming, but in adding nothing to the source of their       common subsistence.\"    British governing classes then, forgoing after 1850 opposition to the  advance of American power, found themselves involved again, as before  1832, in the problem of the possible influence of a prosperous American  democracy upon an unenfranchised public opinion at home. Also, for all  Englishmen, of whatever class, in spite of rivalry in power, of opposing  theories of trade, of divergent political institutions, there existed a  vague, though influential, pride in the advance of a people of similar  race, sprung from British loins[25]. And there remained for all  Englishmen also one puzzling and discreditable American institution,  slavery--held up to scorn by the critics of the United States, difficult  of excuse among her friends.    Agitation conducted by the great philanthropist, Wilberforce, had early  committed British Government and people to a crusade against the African  slave trade. This British policy was clearly announced to the world in  the negotiations at Vienna in 1814-15. But Britain herself still  supported the institution of slavery in her West Indian colonies and it  was not until British humanitarian sentiment had forced emancipation  upon the unwilling sugar planters, in 1833, that the nation was morally  free to criticize American domestic slavery. Meanwhile great  emancipation societies, with many branches, all virile and active, had  grown up in England and in Scotland. These now turned to an attack on  slavery the world over, and especially on American slavery. The great  American abolitionist, Garrison, found more support in England than in  his own country; his weekly paper, _The Liberator_, is full of messages  of cheer from British friends and societies, and of quotations from a  sympathetic, though generally provincial, British press.    From 1830 to 1850 British anti-slavery sentiment was at its height. It  watched with anxiety the evidence of a developing struggle over slavery  in the United States, hopeful, as each crisis arose, that the free  Northern States would impose their will upon the Southern Slave States.  But as each crisis turned to compromise, seemingly enhancing the power  of the South, and committing America to a retention of slavery, the  hopes of British abolitionists waned. The North did indeed, to British  opinion, become identified with opposition to the expansion of slavery,  but after the \"great compromise of 1850,\" where the elder American  statesmen of both North and South proclaimed the \"finality\" of that  measure, British sympathy for the North rapidly lessened. Moreover,  after 1850, there was in Britain itself a decay of general humanitarian  sentiment as regards slavery. The crusade had begun to seem hopeless and  the earlier vigorous agitators were dead. The British Government still  maintained its naval squadron for the suppression of the African slave  trade, but the British official mind no longer keenly interested itself  either in this effort or in the general question of slavery.    Nevertheless American slavery and slave conditions were still, after  1850, favourite matters for discussion, almost universally critical, by  English writers. Each renewal of the conflict in America, even though  local, not national in character, drew out a flood of comment. In the  public press this blot upon American civilization was a steady subject  for attack, and that attack was naturally directed against the South.  The London _Times_, in particular, lost no opportunity of presenting the  matter to its readers. In 1856, a Mr. Thomas Gladstone visited Kansas  during the height of the border struggles there, and reported his  observations in letters to the _Times_. The writer was wholly on the  side of the Northern settlers in Kansas, though not hopeful that the  Kansas struggle would expand to a national conflict. He constantly  depicted the"]]]
