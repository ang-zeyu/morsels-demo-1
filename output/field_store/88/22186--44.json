A little black and white dog, shivering with  cold, and nearly starved. Pedro opened his jacket, and put the dog  inside to keep it warm.    \"You will have to go to the church alone, Little Brother,\" Pedro said.  \"I must take this little dog back to the farm, and give it food, else it  will die.\"    \"But I don't want to go alone, Pedro,\" said Little Brother.    \"Won't you please go and put my gift on the altar, Little Brother? I  wish so much to have it there to-night.\"    \"Yes, Pedro, I will,\" said Little Brother.    He took the gift and started toward the church. Pedro turned and went  home.    When Little Brother came to the great stone church and looked up at the  high tower, he felt that he could not go in alone. He stood outside a  long time watching the people as they passed in. At last he entered  quietly and took a seat in a corner.      III      When Little Brother went into the church, all the people were seated.  They sat quietly hoping that at last the bells would ring again as in  the days of old.    The organ pealed out a Christmas hymn. The choir and the people arose,  and all sang the grand old anthem. Then a solemn voice said, \"Bring now  your gifts to the altar.\"    The king arose and went forward with stately tread. Bowing before the  altar, he laid upon it his golden crown. Then he walked proudly back to  his seat. All the people listened, but the bells did not ring.    Then the queen arose and with haughty step walked to the front. She took  from her neck and wrists her beautiful jewels and laid them upon the  altar. All the people listened, but the bells did not ring.    Then the soldiers came marching proudly forward. They took their jeweled  swords from their belts and laid them upon the altar. All the people  listened, but the bells did not ring.    Then the rich men came hurrying forward. They counted great sums of gold  and laid them in a businesslike way upon the altar. All the people  listened, but the bells did not ring.    \"Can I go all alone to the front of the church and lay this small gift  on the altar?\" said Little Brother. \"Oh, how can I? how can I?\"    Then he said, \"But I told Pedro I would, and I must.\"    So he slipped slowly around by the outer aisle. He crept quietly up to  the altar and softly laid the silver piece upon the very edge.    And listen! What do you think was heard? The bells, the bells!    Oh, how happy the people were! And how happy Little Brother was! He ran  out of the church and down the road toward the farm.    Pedro had warmed the dog and fed it, and was now on the way to the city.  He hoped that he might see the people come out of the church.    Down the road Little Brother came running. Throwing himself into Pedro's  arms, he cried, \"Oh, Pedro, Pedro! The bells, the bells! I wish you  could have heard them; and they rang when I laid your gift on the  altar.\"    \"I did hear them, Little Brother,\" said Pedro. \"Their sound came to me  over the snow,--the sweetest music I ever heard.\"    Long years after, when Pedro grew to be a man, he was a great musician.  Many, many people came to hear him play.    Some one said to him one day, \"How can you play so sweetly? I never  heard such music before.\"    \"Ah,\" said Pedro, \"but you never heard the Christmas bells as I heard  them that Christmas night years and years ago.\"    --OLD TALE RETOLD.

SQUEAKY AND THE SCARE BOX    I      Once upon a time a family of mice lived in the pantry wall. There was a  father mouse, there was a mother mouse, and there were three little baby  mice.    One little mouse had sharp bright eyes and could see everything, even in  the darkest holes. He was called Sharpeyes. His brother could sniff and  smell anything, wherever it might be hidden, and he was called Sniffy.  The baby mouse had such a squeaky little voice that he was called  Squeaky. He was always singing, \"Ee-ee-ee!\"    Mother mouse was very wise, and she had taught her babies to run and  hide when they saw the old cat coming. She had also taught them not to  go near a trap. The little mice obeyed their mother, and they were happy  in their home in the pantry wall.    They had many good times together. I could not tell you about all of  these, but I am going to tell you about their Christmas party and what  happened to Squeaky.    It was the night before Christmas. The stockings hung by the chimney,  and the tall tree was standing in the parlor. The children were asleep,  and the father and mother had gone upstairs to bed.    In the pantry wall, the little mice were all wide-awake.    \"Ee-ee-ee!\" squeaked Squeaky; \"why can't we creep into the big room and  see the tall Christmas tree? The children have talked about it for days,  and we have never seen one. Mother, please let us go and see it.\"    \"Yes,\" said Sniffy, \"do let us go. Everything smells so good. The  children and the cook made long strings of pop corn to-day. I found a  little on the pantry floor, and I want some more.\"    \"I peeped out of our hole,\" said Sharpeyes, \"and I saw cake and candy  all ready for the children. Oh, I do want a bite of those good things!  Please let us have a Christmas party.\"    \"Well,\" said mother mouse, \"I will ask your father. If he says it is  safe, we will go.\"    When mother mouse asked father mouse, he said, \"I will go out first and  look all about. If it is safe, I will come back for you.\"    So father mouse crept softly through the pantry, down the long hall, and  into the parlor. The cat was nowhere to be seen. Father mouse ran back  to the pantry and cried, \"The cat is not near; come and see the tree.\"      II      Then all the mice came scampering from the hole in the wall. They crept  through the pantry, down the long hall, and into the parlor. When they  saw the tall Christmas tree, they squeaked again and again in their joy.  Then they ran around and around the tree to see what was on it.    [Illustration: The mice look at the Christmas tree]    On the floor they saw a wonderful doll's house. \"How fine it would be to  live there!\" they squeaked.    They ran up and down the stairs, sat on the chairs, and lay down in the  beds. Oh, they had a merry time!    Then Sniffy said, \"I smell that good pop corn again. Let's climb up into  the Christmas tree and get some.\"    They climbed up into the tree. They nibbled the pop corn; they nibbled  the candy; they nibbled the nuts; and they nibbled the cakes.    Soon Sharpeyes cried out, \"Come here, I see a mouse! I see a mouse! But  he doesn't look like our family at all.\"    \"I should say not,\" sniffed Sniffy; \"and how good he smells!\"    \"Why, he is good to eat!\" squeaked Squeaky; and they all began to eat  the chocolate mouse.    Then they found another candy mouse--a pretty pink one. They were so  busy eating it that they forgot to watch and listen; then--bang! The  door was opened, and the lights were turned on.    With a squeak, the mice scampered down from the tree; then they ran  along the hall, through the pantry, and back to their home. There was  the father mouse, and the mother mouse, and Sharpeyes, and Sniffy. But  where was Squeaky?      III      Now, as Squeaky tried to run down the tree, he fell heels over head.  Down, down, down, he fell until he was caught in a funny box. An ugly  man with black hair and black whiskers seemed to be hopping out of the  box.    When Squeaky saw the lights turned on, he hid under the dress of this  queer man. He lay very, very still, for he had been taught to be still  when danger was near. He heard voices. The father and mother had come  back.    \"Yes,\" the father was saying; \"it would have been a shame to forget this  train. I would like it to come right out from under the tree. Help me  put the track down, mother.\"    When the train was just where it should be, the mother turned to the  beautiful tree.    \"Why, look at that Jack-in-the-box,\" she said. \"The man is hanging out.  That will never do. I will shut the box. Teddy must see the man jump  out.\"    The mother pushed the man with the black hair down, down, into the box  and shut the lid. Poor Squeaky felt the springs close down on him and  squeaked, \"Ee-ee-\"    \"That was a fine squeak,\" said the father. \"The toys are wonderful these  days.\"    \"Yes,\" said the mother, as she turned off the light. \"When I was a  child, we did not have such toys.\"    \"I am in a trap,\" said poor Squeaky, \"but there isn't even a bit of  cheese in it. I wonder what kind of trap it is; nothing seems to hurt  me. Well, I am safe for a while, and I hope I shall soon get out.\"    Squeaky lay in the box all night, and wondered what Sniffy and Sharpeyes  were doing. The next morning, he heard children calling, \"Merry  Christmas! Merry Christmas!\" And soon the toys were taken down, one by  one. Then such a noise was heard--drums beating, horns tooting, children  shouting. You should have heard it.    [Illustration: The mother is surprised as Squeaky escapes]    \"See our new doll's house!\" cried one child.    \"See my new train! How fast it goes!\" cried another.    \"And see my beautiful dolly!\" cried another. \"She can open and shut her  eyes.\"    By and by the mother took the box from the tree. \"Come here, Teddy,\" she  said. \"Here is a scare box. We will have some fun. Watch me open the  lid.\"    Teddy stood by his mother and watched closely.    \"Are you ready?\" asked his mother. \"Well, let us count.

Now I must stop, hoping that we may see you  here some day soon.\"    The older folks started discussing the life in Palestine. Directly Mr  Jacobs had finished reading the letter, they agreed that it could only  be in Palestine that a truly Jewish life could be lived, for everything  depends so much on environment. \"In London the surroundings are against  a consistently Jewish religious life,\" said one; \"if you try, it is just  like swimming against a strong current.\" \"But here comes our chance,\"  replied another, \"for if we fight or swim against the current, we  gradually become stronger, and at last we are able to swim well in spite  of it, and so win the race and prize. If we just swim with the current,  or just suit our life to our environment, which of course at first is  much easier and pleasanter, the current at last carries us along so  rapidly that we are unable to avoid rocks or crags in the river, and  then we 'go under,' or make shipwreck of our lives.\"    \"That's true indeed,\" said all the elders, shaking their heads solemnly.  \"Then,\" replied Mr Jacobs, \"our greatest duty is to have one thought and  one aim constantly in our minds, no matter what our environment may be,  and that thought is that God's Holy Spirit is in and around all who try  to obey Him, no matter where they are; and it is only by the guidance  and help of His Holy Spirit that we can lead true, consistent, Jewish  lives, live up to the old familiar words of the Shema, and love our  neighbours as ourselves.\"          THE SABBATH IN PALESTINE      When Mr Jacobs' family and friends assembled again on Friday evening, he  said: \"You know what discussions there have been lately in England about  the proper way to keep the Sabbath, so it may interest you to hear a  letter from my cousin, giving an account how Sabbath was kept in  Jerusalem.\"    \"My dear Millie,--I will explain as well as I can what it means to  prepare for Sabbath here, and how it is spent. About four o'clock on  Friday mornings Mother and I get up and prepare the Sabbath loaves. I  can tell you it is no easy matter, for, even when the weather is not  frosty, the exertion of kneading the dough makes you perspire. If you  finish kneading early enough, you get back to bed while the dough is  rising.    \"Early on Friday mornings beggars start going from house to house  (especially the Sephardim and Yemenites or Arabian Jews). At each house  they are given small, fresh-baked chola, bun, or beigel. No one refuses  to give this. Later on, two respectable men or women go from house to  house collecting in a large bag whatever anyone gives them, such as  cholas, meat, cereals, oil, wine, or money. The Community know that  these things are not for themselves, but are to be distributed amongst  the sick and the most needy, who cannot beg for themselves. Sometimes we  have as many as six or seven people who come collecting, and no one ever  thinks of refusing them. In fact, everyone prepares for this, and gives  most willingly, knowing that the Sabbath must be celebrated by rich and  poor alike with the best one has.    \"In a future letter I will tell you more about certain people who give  up a part of their time to works of charity, and how they do it; for  there is no Board of Guardians here, as there is in London.    \"Then when Father and the boys go to synagogue, we start to prepare for  the day's work. First we take all the furniture we can out of the house,  so as to leave the rooms free for the lower part of the walls to be  whitewashed and the marble floors cleaned. Of course, we try to use as  little water as possible, as it is scarce, but even so the floors must  be clean and look well polished, and the wooden furniture washed and  rubbed well with sand.    \"Then the tea-urn and all the saucepans and trays, which are either  brass or copper, have to be cleaned and brightened; and, as we cannot  get brass-polish here, we rub them with fine sand. It needs plenty of  'elbow grease' to make them look bright, but the rubbing well repays us.  Since we came here I quite understand how brass or copper  looking-glasses were used by our ancestors, for, after rubbing very hard  with fine sand and a piece of lemon peel, you can see your face clearly  reflected in the trays. Some who had no mirror used the trays for  looking-glasses.    \"Mother prepares our Sabbath meals, whilst we girls are doing the hard  work--hanging up our best curtains or putting our best covers on the  beds and cushions, and spreading the Sabbath table-cloth. These are put  away again on Saturday evenings. Those who have them also use special  Sabbath china, glass, and silver for their meals.    \"This work keeps us busy nearly all day. About three hours before sunset  Father and the boys go to the public baths, and by the time they return  we are all dressed in our best clothes, the samovar (the urn) is placed  on a table in the porch, and we all sit there to rest and drink tea,  awaiting the coming in of 'Princess Sabbath.' A matter of an hour before  Sabbath a voice is heard calling out:    'Sabbath is in, friends! Sabbath is in!'    \"The first time I heard the call I could not understand the reason until  Father told me that, as there are no bells in the suburb and very few  people have clocks, one of the highly-respected members of the  community undertakes the job of going right round Meah Sheorim every  Friday, so that the women may know when to light their Sabbath  lamps--for directly the Sabbath call is heard all the women stop  whatever work they are at and go to light the Sabbath lamp, which has  seven wicks, in a basin of oil hanging from the ceiling, for there are  no candles here. When this is done the men and children go to synagogue,  and some of the women too. As they all love bright colours, when you see  them from a distance walking to synagogue, the suburb looks like a  flower-garden.    \"After Sabbath dinner, which consists of the _cholent_ baked on the  previous day, Father gathers the boys round the table to hear what  lessons they have learnt during the week. He discusses and explains part  of the Torah to them, while mother and we girls read the Zeene ureene (a  commentary on the Bible for women), the Ethics of the Fathers, and the  like. This goes on for some time, and then we are free to go and visit  our friends. We and several of our friends often go to an old lady's  house, where we spend pleasant Sabbath afternoons.    \"Years ago this dear old lady came from Russia to end her days in the  Holy Land. She is well provided for by her children, so she has the  time and means to lead a happy and useful life here, and does a lot of  good quietly, by the cheery, sensible way she often gives a \"helping  hand\" to those who need it.    \"She so understands all our fun that we sometimes forget she is old. We  just talk things over with her as we would with our young friends. Not  only we girls, but young married women, just love spending part of the  Sabbath afternoons with her. The room is often so full that we have to  sit cross-legged, like the Turks, on the marble floor, which in summer  time is quite the coolest seat.    \"We then play 'Nuts.' Each one puts a certain number into a cap, but to  win the game one has to be very quick and sharp: it is really quite  exciting. What we like best is when the old lady sits amongst us and  reads us a tale from a book, or some of the papers sent her from abroad.  The stories are very tantalizing, for they always leave off at the most  interesting part, and then we may have to wait a week or two before we  get the next number! During the week we try to imagine what the next  chapter will be like.    \"Sometimes she reads from the Ethics of the Fathers--those wise sayings  of the ancient Rabbis. I remember last week she told us of one of the  Rabbis who wrote that 'those who control or overcome their hasty  tempers are greater than those who take a city from an enemy,' She, as  usual, asks us to give our views on what she has read, and an excited  discussion follows. Those of us who naturally have a calm, good temper  said that they did not agree with the Rabbi, because they did not think  it at all hard to keep their temper when provoked. Others, who had hasty  passionate tempers, said the Rabbi was quite right: it would be far  easier, they felt sure, to take a city than to control their tempers,  for the whole nation would help them to take a city, as it was  considered a grand thing to do, but very few people would help them to  control their tempers. In fact, even their relatives and friends  provoked them to be hasty and passionate. When provoked or irritated the  blood rushes so quickly to the head that it makes it very, very hard to  remain calm, and then we often say or do things we are really sorry for  afterwards.    \"As we could not agree, we turned to the old lady, for she is full of  wisdom and understanding. She tried to pacify us, for we were nearly on  the verge of quarreling. She said that if, when young, we tried, with  the Almighty's help, to keep our hasty tempers under control, it would  be easier to do so every time we were provoked, but the older we were  before beginning, the more difficult it would be to be successful.  Even then we had always to keep a watch over ourselves, for one of our  wise sages wrote: 'One is never sure of himself till the day of his  death.' We all saw the wisdom of her advice, and made up our minds that  we must all help each other, for very often the calm quiet natures are  those who love teasing and provoking the hasty-tempered ones, for the  fun of seeing them get into a temper; and this, we realized after her  talk with us, was not pleasing to God.
