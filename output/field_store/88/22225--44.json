The bitterness of both Poles and Russians against the Jews  grew especially intense as the days of the rozbior, the Partition of  Poland, drew near (1794). The Poles, forgetting the many examples of  loyalty and self-sacrifice shown by Jews in times of peace and war,  suspected them of being treacherous and unreliable; while the Russians,  though denying the patriotism of their own Jews, persisted in the  accusation that Polish Jews spent money lavishly in fomenting rebellion  and anarchy. The pupils of the Jesuits found great delight in attacks  upon the Jews, which frequently culminated in riot and bloodshed and the  payment of money by Jews to Catholic institutions. \"What appalling  spectacles,\" exclaims a Christian writer, \"must we witness in the  capital [Warsaw] on solemn holidays. Students and even adults in noisy  mobs assault the Jews, and sometimes beat them with sticks. We have seen  a gang waylay a Jew, stop his horses, and strike him till he fell from  the wagon. How can we look with indifference on such a survival of  barbarism?\" The commonest manifestations of hatred and superstition,  however, were, as in other countries, the charge that Jews were  magicians, using the black art to avenge themselves on their  persecutors, and that they used Christian blood for their observance of  the Passover. The latter crime, the imputing of which was sternly  prohibited by an edict of the liberal Bathory, in 1576, was so  frequently laid at their door, that in the short period of sixty years  (1700-1760) not less than twenty such accusations were brought against  them, ending each time in the massacre of Jews by infuriated mobs. Even  more shocking, if possible, was the frequent extermination of whole  communities by the brigand bands known as Haidamacks. They added the  \"Massacre of Uman\" (1768) to the Jewish calendar of misfortunes, the  most terrible slaughter, equalled, perhaps, only by that of Nemirov in  1648.[5]    That all this should have left a marked impression on the mentality and  intellectuality of the Jews, is little to be wondered at. The marvel is  that they should have maintained their superiority over their  surroundings, and continued to be a law-abiding and God-fearing people.  While among the Russians and Poles the nobles who learned to read or  write formed a rare exception, there was hardly one among the Jews, the  very lowliest of them, who could not read Hebrew, and even translate it  into the vernacular. Maimon tells us that in his early youth he became  the family tutor of \"a miserable farmer in a still more miserable  village,\" who yet was ambitious of giving his children an education of  some kind.        Fortunately for the Jews of those times--says a writer--their      civilization was by far superior to that of the Christians. The      rabbi, though in no way inferior to the priest mentally, was      immeasurably above him morally. The students of the yeshibot,      despite their exclusive devotion to the study of the Talmud, yet      were better equipped for intellectual work, were of broader      minds and better manners, than the pupils of the Jesuits. And      the Jewish ba'ale battim, with an education as good as that of      the Gentile shlyakhta, had a more ennobling and elevating object      in life.[6]    It is remarkable how quickly they recuperated from the blows they  received. In 1648 thousands of people were killed, whole communities  exterminated, Volhynia, Podolia, and a great part of Lithuania utterly  ruined. In 1660, in those very places, we hear again of Jewish  settlements, with synagogues and schools and a system of education of  the kind described in the preceding chapter, and we hear of the Council  of Lithuania struggling to re-establish and cement the shattered  foundation of their self-government. Yet all their efforts improved the  demoralized condition of the country but little. As always in national  crises, the individual was sacrificed to the community, and deprived of  the few rights remaining to him. The kehillot became brutally  oppressive. There were no longer men of the stamp of Abraham Rapoport,  Solomon Luria, Mordecai Jaffe, and Meir Katz, to put their feet on the  neck of tyranny. Without special permission no one could buy or sell, or  move from one place to another, or learn a trade or practice a  profession. Rabbinism became synonymous with rigorism, the coercion of  untold customs became unbearable, and the spirit of Judaism was lost in  a heap of innumerable rites. The Jew's every act had to be sanctioned by  religion. He knew of the outward world only from the heavy taxes he paid  in order to be allowed to exist, and from the bloody riots with which  his people was frequently visited.    What could result from such a state of affairs but poverty, material and  spiritual, with all the suffering it engenders? Those at the head of the  kehillot, being responsible solely to the Government, often had to  deliver the full tale of bricks like the Jewish overseers in Egypt,  though no straw was given to them. On one occasion Rabbi Mikel of Shkud  was arrested because the kahal could not pay the thousand gulden it  owed. In 1767, the whole kahal of Vilna went to Warsaw to protest  against intolerable taxation. Such protests were usually of little  avail. On the other hand, a few powerful families throve at the expense  of their oppressed coreligionists. This aroused a spirit of animosity  and a clamor for the abolition of the kahal institution. Jewish autonomy  was more and more encroached upon. Rabbinates were bought and sold, and  the aid of the Government was invoked in religious controversies. A  question regarding the preferable form of prayer was submitted to the  decision of Paul I. In 1777, Prince Radziwill decided who should  officiate as rabbi in so important a centre of Judaism as Vilna,[7] and  in 1804 the Government issued a \"regulation\" depriving the kahal of its  judicial functions altogether.    What was even more disastrous was the spiritual poverty of the masses.  Seldom have the awful warnings of the great lawgiver been fulfilled so  literally as during the eighteenth century:        And upon them that remain of you, I will send a faintness into      their hearts in the land of their enemies; and the sound of a      shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee as fleeing      from a sword; and they shall fall, when none pursueth. And they      shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when      none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your      enemies (Lev. 26: 36-37).        But the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and      failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind. And thy life shall hang in      doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and thou      shalt have none assurance of thy life (Deut. 29: 65-66).    Having learned from sad experience that there was no crime their foes  were incapable of perpetrating, they gave credence to every rumor as to  an established fact. A report that boys and girls were to be prohibited  from marrying before a certain age resulted in behalot (panics), during  which children of the tenderest ages were united as husband and wife  (1754, 1764, 1793). Mysticism became rampant. \"Messiah\" after \"Messiah\"  \"revealed\" himself as the one promised to redeem Israel from all his  troubles. Love of God began to be tinged with fear of the devil, and  incantations to take the place of religious belief. The _Zohar_ and  works full of superstition, such as the _Kab ha-Yashar_, _Midrash  Talpiyot_, and _Nishmat Hayyim_, the first studied by men, the others by  both sexes, but mostly by women, prepared their minds for all sorts of  mongrel beliefs. \"In no land,\" says Tobias Cohn, \"is the practice of  summoning up devils and spirits by means of the Cabbalistic abracadabra  so prevalent, and the belief in dreams and visions so strong, as in  Poland.\"[8] All this, though it strengthened religious fervor in some,  undermined it in others. Sects came into being, struggled, and, having  brought added misery upon their followers, disappeared. Jewish criminals  escaped justice by invoking the power of the Catholic priesthood and  promising to become converted to Christianity.[9] And now and then even  Talmudists left the fold, as, for instance, Carl Anton, the Courland  pupil of Eybeschuetz, who became professor of Hebrew at Hamsted, and  wrote numerous works on Judaism. Others hoped to win the favor of the  Gentiles by preaching a mixture of Judaism and Catholicism. In many  places, especially in the Ukraine, the seat of learning that had  suffered most from the ravages of the Cossacks, the state of morals sank  very low, owing to the teaching of Jacob Querido, the self-proclaimed  son of the pseudo-Messiah Shabbatai Zebi, \"that the sinfulness of the  world can be overcome only by a super-abundance of sin.\" This paved the  way for the last of the long list of Messiahs, Jacob (Yankev Leibovich)  Frank of Podolia. His experiences, adventures, and hairbreadth escapes,  his entire career, beginning with his return from his travels in Turkey,  through his conversion to Catholicism (1759), to the day of his death as  \"Baron von Offenbach,\" would furnish material for a stirring drama. As  if to counteract this demoralizing tendency, a new sect, known as  Hasidim, originating in Lithuania and headed by Judah Hasid of Dubno and  Hayyim Malak, taught its devotees to hasten the advent of the Messiah by  doing penance for the sins of Israel. They were so firmly convinced of  the efficacy of fasts and prayers that they went to Jerusalem by  hundreds to witness the impending redemption (ab. 1706). But the ascetic  Hasidim and the epicurean Frankists were alike doomed to disappear or to  be swallowed up by a new Hasidism, combining the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#7)"],[1,"by Professor Erman.                     THE MAGICIAN UBAANER AND THE WAX CROCODILE    The first story describes an event which happened in the reign of Nebka,  a king of the third dynasty. It was told by Prince Khafra to King Khufu  (Cheops). The magician was called Ubaaner,[1] and he was the chief  Kher-heb in the temple of Ptah of Memphis, and a very learned man. He  was a married man, but his wife loved a young man who worked in the  fields, and she sent him by the hands of one of her maids a box  containing a supply of very fine clothes. Soon after receiving this gift  the young man proposed to the magician's wife that they should meet and  talk in a certain booth or lodge in her garden, and she instructed the  steward to have the lodge made ready for her to receive her friend in  it. When this was done, she went to the lodge, and she sat there with  the young man and drank beer with him until the evening, when he went  his way. The steward, knowing what had happened, made up his mind to  report the matter to his master, and as soon as the morning had come, he  went to Ubaaner and informed him that his wife had spent the previous  day drinking beer with such and such a young man. Ubaaner then told the  steward to fetch him his casket made of ebony and silver-gold, which  contained materials and instruments used in working magic, and when it  was brought him, he took out some wax, and fashioned a figure of a  crocodile seven spans long. He then recited certain magical words over  the crocodile, and said to it, \"When the young man comes to bathe in my  lake thou shalt seize him.\" Then giving the wax crocodile to the  steward, Ubaaner said to him, \"When the young man goes down to the lake  to bathe according to his daily habit, thou shalt throw the crocodile  into the water after him.\" Having taken the crocodile from his master  the steward departed.    [Footnote 1: This name means \"splitter of stones.\" It will be remembered  that the late Sir H.M. Stanley was called the \"stone-splitter,\" because  of his great strength of deed and word.]    Then the wife of Ubaaner told the steward to set the little lodge in the  garden in order, because she was going to spend some time there. When  the steward had furnished the lodge, she went there, and the young  peasant paid her a visit. After leaving the lodge he went and bathed in  the lake, and the steward followed him and threw the wax crocodile into  the water; it immediately turned into a large crocodile 7 cubits (about  11 feet) long and seized the young man and swallowed him up. When this  took place the magician Ubaaner was with the king, and he remained in  attendance upon him for seven days, during which time the young man was  in the lake, with no air to breathe. When the seven days were ended King  Nebka proposed to take a walk with the magician. Whilst they were going  along Ubaaner asked the king if he would care to see a wonderful thing  that had happened to a young peasant, and the king said he would, and  forthwith walked to the place to which the magician led him. When they  arrived at the lake Ubaaner uttered a spell over the crocodile, and  commanded it to come up out of the water bringing the young man with  him; and the crocodile did so. When the king saw the beast he exclaimed  at its hideousness, and seemed to be afraid of it, but the magician  stooped down fearlessly, and took the crocodile up in his hand, and lo,  the living crocodile had disappeared, and only a crocodile of wax  remained in its place. Then Ubaaner told King Nebka the story of how the  young man had spent days in the lodge in the garden talking and drinking  beer with his wife, and His Majesty said to the wax crocodile, \"Get thee  gone, and take what is thine with thee.\" And the wax crocodile leaped  out of the magician's hand into the lake, and once more became a large,  living crocodile. And it swam away with the young man, and no one ever  knew what became of it afterwards. Then the king made his servants seize  Ubaaner's wife, and they carried her off to the ground on the north side  of the royal palace, and there they burned her, and they scattered her  ashes in the river. When King Khufu had heard the story he ordered many  offerings to be made in the tomb of his predecessor Nebka, and gifts to  be presented to the magician Ubaaner.                 THE MAGICIAN TCHATCHAMANKH AND THE GOLD ORNAMENT    The Prince Baiufra stood up and offered to relate to King Khufu (Cheops)  a story of a magician called Tchatchamankh, who flourished in the reign  of Seneferu, the king's father. The offer having been accepted, Baiufra  proceeded to relate the following: On one occasion it happened that  Seneferu was in a perplexed and gloomy state of mind, and he wandered  distractedly about the rooms and courts of his palace seeking to find  something wherewith to amuse himself, but he failed to do so. Then he  bethought himself of the court magician Tchatchamankh, and he ordered  his servants to summon him to the presence. When the great Kher-heb and  scribe arrived, he addressed him as \"my brother,\" and told him that he  had been wandering about in his palace seeking for amusement, and had  failed to find it. The magician promptly suggested to the king that he  should have a boat got ready, decorated with pretty things that would  give pleasure, and should go for a row on the lake. The motions of the  rowers as they rowed the boat about would interest him, and the sight of  the depths of the waters, and the pretty fields and gardens round about  the lake, would give him great pleasure. \"Let me,\" said the magician,  \"arrange the matter. Give me twenty ebony paddles inlaid with gold and  silver, and twenty pretty maidens with flowing hair, and twenty network  garments wherein to dress them.\" The king gave orders for all these  things to be provided, and when the boat was ready, and the maidens who  were to row had taken their places, he entered the boat and sat in his  little pavilion and was rowed about on the lake. The magician's views  proved to be correct, for the king enjoyed himself, and was greatly  amused in watching the maidens row. Presently the handle of the paddle  of one of the maidens caught in her long hair, and in trying to free it  a malachite ornament which she was wearing in her hair fell into the  water and disappeared. The maiden was much troubled over her loss, and  stopped rowing, and as her stopping threw out of order the strokes of  the maidens who were sitting on the same seat as she was, they also  stopped rowing. Thereupon the king asked why the rowing had ceased, and  one of the maidens told him what had happened; and when he promised that  the ornament should be recovered, the maiden said words which seem to  mean that she had no doubt that she should recover it. On this Seneferu  caused Tchatchamankh to be summoned into the presence, and when he came  the king told him all that had happened. Then the magician began to  recite certain spells, the effect of which was to cause the water of the  lake first to divide into two parts, and then the water on one side to  rise up and place itself on the water on the other side. The boat,  presumably, sank down gently on the ground of the lake, for the  malachite ornament was seen lying there, and the magician fetched it,  and returned it to its owner. The depth of the water in the middle of  the lake where the ornament dropped was 12 cubits (between 18 and 19  feet), and when the water from one side was piled up on that on the  other, the total depth of the two sections taken together was, we are  told, 24 cubits. As soon as the ornament was restored to the maiden, the  magician recited further spells, and the water lowered itself, and  spread over the ground of the lake, and so regained its normal level.  His Majesty, King Seneferu, assembled his nobles, and having discussed  the matter with them, made a handsome gift to his clever magician. When  King Khufu had heard the story he ordered a large supply of funerary  offerings to be sent to the tomb of Seneferu, and bread, beer, flesh,  and incense to the tomb of Tchatchamankh.           THE MAGICIAN TETA WHO RESTORED LIFE TO DEAD ANIMALS, ETC.    When Baiufra had finished the story given above, Prince Herutataf, the  son of King Khufu, and a very wise man, with whose name Egyptian  tradition associated the discovery of certain chapters of the Book of  the Dead, stood up before his father to speak, and said to him, \"Up to  the present thou hast only heard tales about the wisdom of magicians who  are dead and gone, concerning which it is quite impossible to know  whether they be true or not. Now, I want Thy Majesty to see a certain  sage who is actually alive during thy lifetime, whom thou knowest not.\"  His Majesty Khufu said, \"Who is it, Herutataf?\" And Prince Herutataf  replied, \"He is a certain peasant who is called Teta, and he lives in  Tet-Seneferu. He is one hundred and ten years old, and up to this very  day he eats five hundred bread-cakes (_sic_), and a leg of beef, and  drinks one hundred pots of beer. He knows how to reunite to its body a  head which has been cut off, he knows how to make a lion follow him  whilst the rope with which he is tied drags behind him on the ground,  and he knows the numbers of the Apet chambers (?) of the shrine (?) of  Thoth.\" Now His Majesty had been seeking for a long time past for the  number of the Apet chambers (?) of Thoth, for he had wished to make  something like it for his \"horizon.\"[1] And King Khufu said to his son  Herutataf, \"My son, thou thyself shalt go and bring the sage to me\";  thereupon a boat was made ready for Prince Herutataf, who forthwith set  out on his journey to Tet-Seneferu, the home of the sage. When the  prince came to the spot on the river bank that was nearest to the  village of Teta, he had the boat tied up, and he continued his journey  overland seated in a sort of sedan chair made of"]]]
