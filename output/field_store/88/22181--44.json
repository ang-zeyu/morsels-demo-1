The Marquis de Brancifort has lately established some useful  manufactures in Teneriffe.    To enter into much detail concerning the Canary Islands, which lie  exactly in the course of every ship that sails from Europe to the Cape,  and consequently have been described in almost every book of voyages,  must be superfluous. A few general notices concerning them may, perhaps,  not be unacceptable. They are in number about fourteen, of which the  principal, and only considerable are, Canary, Teneriffe, Fortaventure,  Palma, Ferro, Gomera, Lancerotta. Their distance from the coast of Africa  is from about forty to eighty leagues. The circumference of Teneriffe is  not above one hundred and twenty miles, but that of Canary, or as it is  usually called, the Great Canary, is one hundred and fifty. They have  been possessed and colonized by Spain from the beginning of the 15th  century.    There is no reason to doubt that these are the islands slightly known to  the ancients under the name of Fortunate: though the mistake of Ptolemy  concerning their latitude has led one of the commentators on Solinus to  contend, that this title belongs rather to the Islands of Cape Verd.  Pliny mentions Canaria, and accounts for that name from the number of  large dogs which the island contained; a circumstance which some modern  voyagers, perhaps with little accuracy, repeat as having occasioned the  same name to be given by the Spaniards. Nivaria, spoken of by the same  author, is evidently Teneriffe, and synonymous, if we are rightly  informed, to the modern name*. Ombrion, or Pluvialia, is supposed to be  Ferro; where the dryness of the soil has at all times compelled the  inhabitants to depend for water on the rains.    [* Occasioned by the perpetual snows with which the Peak is covered. Tener  is said to mean snow, and itte or iffe a mountain, in the language of the  island.]    If the ancients made these islands the region of fable, and their poets  decorated them with imaginary charms to supply the want of real  knowledge, the moderns cannot wholly be exempted from a similar  imputation. Travellers have delighted to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe,  as the highest mountain in the ancient world, whereas, by the best  accounts, Mont Blanc exceeds it* by 3523 feet, or near a mile of  perpendicular altitude. The Isle of Ferro, having no such mountain to  distinguish it, was celebrated for a century or two on the credit of a  miraculous tree, single in its kind, enveloped in perpetual mists, and  distilling sufficient water for the ample supply of the island.** But this  wonder, though vouched by several voyagers, and by some as eye-witnesses,  vanished at the approach of sober enquiry, nor could a single native be  found hardy enough to assert its existence. The truth is, that the Canary  Isles, though a valuable possession to Spain, and an excellent resource  to voyagers of all nations, contain no wonders, except what belong  naturally to volcanic mountains such as the Peak, which, though it always  threatens, has not now been noxious for more than eighty years***.    [* The height of Mont Blanc, on a mean of the best accounts, is 15,673  English feet from the level of the sea, Teneriffe 12,150.]    [** Clipperton speaks of it as a fact, Harris's Voyages, Vol. I. p. 187.  Mandelsloe pretended to have seen it, ibid. p. 806. Baudrand was the  first who by careful enquiry detected the fiction. An account of this  imaginary tree, curious from being so circumstantial, is here given from  a French book of geography, of some credit in other respects. \"Mais ce  qu'il-y-a de plus digne de remarque, est cet arbre merveilleux qui  fournit d'eau toute l'isle, tant pour les hommes que pour les betes. Cet  arbre, que les habitans appellent Caroe, Garoe, ou Arbre Saint, unique en  son espece, est gros, et large de branches; son tronc a environ douze  pieds de tour; ses feuilles sont un peu plus grosses que celles des  noiers, et toujours vertes; il porte un fruit, semblable a un gland, qui  a un noiau d'un gout aromatique, doux et piquant. Cet arbre est  perpetuellement convert d'un nuage, qui l'humecte partout, en sorte que  l'eau en distille goutte a goutte par les branches et par les feuilles,  en telle quantite qu'on en peut emplir trente tonneaux par jour. Cette  eau est extremement fraiche, claire, fort bonne a boire, et fort saine.  Elle tombe dans deux bassins de pierre que les insulaires ont batis pour  la recevoir. La nuage qui couvre cet arbre ne se dissipe pas; settlement  dans les grandes chaleurs de l'ete il se diminue un peu; mais en echange  la mer envoie une vapeur epaisse, qui se jette sur l'arbre, et qui  supplee a ce manquement.\" Du Bois Geogr. Part. iii. ch. 17. Can all this  have arisen from Pliny's arbores ex quibus aquae exprimantur?]    [*** See Captain Glasse's elaborate account of the Canaries, and Captain  Cook's last Voyage.]    The capital of Teneriffe is Laguna, or more properly San Christoval de la  Laguna, St. Christopher of the Lake, so called from its situation near a  lake. Both this and Santa Cruz are built of stone, but the appearance of  the latter is more pleasing than that of Laguna. They are distant from  each other about four miles. The capital of the Great Canary, and  properly of the whole government, is the City of Palms: But that place  has been for some time the centre of ecclesiastical government only. The  custom of reckoning the first meridian as passing through these isles was  begun by Ptolemy; and perhaps it is still to be wished that the French  regulations on that subject were generally adopted.    9 June 1787.    Our ships were at length preparing to depart, when on the evening of the  9th of June, a convict belonging to the Alexander, having been employed  on deck, found means to cut away the boat, and make a temporary escape;  but he was missed and soon retaken. It is not probable that he had formed  any definite plan of escape; the means of absconding must have been  accidentally offered, and suddenly embraced; and for making such an  attempt, the vague hope of liberty, without any certain prospect, would  naturally afford sufficient temptation.    10 June 1787    By the 10th of June the ships had completed their water, and early the  next morning, the Governor gave the signal for weighing anchor, and the  fleet pursued its course.

Vegetables not having been so plentiful at Santa Cruz as to afford a  sufficient supply, it was the intention of Governor Phillip to anchor for  about twenty-four hours in the Bay of Port Praya. The islands on this  side of the Atlantic, seem as if expressly placed to facilitate the  navigation to and from the Cape of Good Hope: by offering to vessels,  without any material variation from their course, admirable stations for  supply and refreshment. About latitude 40, north, the Azores; in 33, the  Madeiras; between 29 and 27, the Canaries; and between 18 and 16, the  Islands of Cape Verd, successively offer themselves to the voyager,  affording abundantly every species of accommodation his circumstances can  require. On the Southern side of the Equator, a good harbour and  abundance of turtles give some consequence even to the little barren  island of Ascension; and St. Helena, by the industry of the English  settlers, has become the seat of plenty and of elegance. Without the  assistance derived, in going or returning, from some of these places, the  interval of near forty degrees on each side of the line, in a sea exposed  to violent heat, and subject to tedious calms, would be sufficient to  discourage even the navigators of the eighteenth century.    18 June 1787    On the 18th of June, the fleet came in sight of the Cape Verd Islands,  and was directed by signal to steer for St. Jago. But the want of  favourable wind, and the opposition of a strong current making it  probable that all the ships would not be able to get into the Bay, the  Governor thought it best to change his plan. The signal for anchoring was  hauled down, and the ships were directed to continue their first course;  a circumstance of much disappointment to many individuals on board, who,  as is natural in long voyages, were eager on every occasion to enjoy the  refreshments of the shore. As an additional incitement to such wishes,  the weather had now become hot; the thermometer stood at 82 deg., which,  though not an immoderate heat for a tropical climate, is sufficient to  produce considerable annoyance. But, unmoved by any consideration except  that of expedience, Governor Phillip persisted in conducting his ships to  their next intended station, the harbour of Rio de Janeiro.    It may appear perhaps,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15106"],[0,"Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed (2nd ed.) (#7)"],[1," so fenced in with nugatory trammels and conditions that  it had for those reasons to be rejected; whilst that at five years was  coupled with the equally unacceptable conditions that the claim of  suzerainty should be renounced, and that in all other respects the  Transvaal should be recognised as absolutely independent in terms of the  Sand River Convention of 1852.    Those offers could hardly have been made in sincerity, but rather as a  temporary device and to meet the susceptibilities of the advising  Powers, for all the time preparations for war were never relaxed for a  moment, but were pushed on with extreme vigour. On the other hand, the  British programme seeking to ensure peace by the franchise expedient had  been strictly followed without deviation. When the Transvaal Government  professed irritation over the disposition of some British troops too  near the Transvaal border, they were promptly removed to more remote and  less strategic positions, rather than incur the risk of rupture. During  the month preceding the outbreak of the war, some large continental  consignments of war munitions were, as usual, permitted to reach the  Republics unhindered through several Colonial ports, portions being  actually smuggled over the Colonial railways as merchandise addressed to  a well-known Pretoria firm, but on arrival were secretly delivered,  under cover of night, at the various forts and arsenals. These  proceedings were carried out with the connivance of the Colonial Bond  authorities, and though known to the British Governor, it was all winked  at rather than hazard the momentous objects of peace by the introduction  of another knotty subject. To sum up the situation, it was a diplomatic  contest on the part of Great Britain aiming at peace and to safeguard  her possessions and prestige, while the Afrikaner Bond, on the other  part, continued active in the work of sedition and preparing for a war  of usurpation. Every one must admit that the demand of the British  Ministry for an immediate and adequate representation proceeded from the  necessity and the desire to overcome the South African crisis in a just  and pacific way. The measure was counted upon to effect conciliation  between the Uitlander and burgher elements, and as a further result was  earnestly hoped to bring about the secession of the Transvaal from the  Afrikaner Bond, and so reduce that dangerous confederacy to a somewhat  negligible impotence. To discover other objects of a sinister sort  lurking behind needs a more than inventive genius. A united Afrikaner  Bond, persistent to carry out its fell project, definitely meant war  sooner or later. Its first step in launching out to it was that  notorious ultimatum, which was tantamount to snatching back the feigned  offers of the seven and five years' franchise. According to original  programme, the very next step to accomplish the _coup d'etat_ was the  immediate seizure of all Colonial ports, and to complete a general and  irrevocable Boer rising all over the Colonies.    All the while the old device had been put into practice of hiding Bond  guilt by accusing England of designs against the integrity of the Boer  Republics. But directly after, in the exultation of victorious  invasions, the mask was shamelessly dropped, and Boerdom stands out  defiantly and nakedly self-confessed, aiming at conquest and supremacy  over all South Africa. Will the ensuing century have in store an  instance to match that record plot of artifice and dissimulation, and  see half the world duped into partisanship with it--by journalistic  craft?    It may well be imagined that Mr. Chamberlain and his noble colleagues  had anything but beds of roses whilst pursuing the diplomacy adopted to  checkmate the Bond. They had to gain national support without divulging  their own proceeding, and were at the same time reduced to a situation  which imposed a spartan fortitude in concealing and repressing  involuntary perturbation in the presence of an impending national  crisis, and also the stoical endurance of bitter recriminations on the  part of an opposition comprising a large and honourable but poorly  informed section of the English nation.          BOER LANGUAGE      We come now to the topic of language, which will be found relevant,  showing Hollander and Bond influence in using that also as a hostile  weapon. What the Boers still speak is a vernacular or dialect so far  removed from High Dutch as to be unintelligible to the uninitiated  Hollander. It took its form from the dialects brought to the Cape of  Good Hope by unlettered Dutch colonists and a large admixture of locally  produced idioms, with a slight trace of the structure of the French  language in expressing negations. In the two Republics High Dutch rules  for official purposes, but in common intercourse the vernacular Dutch is  still about the same as it had been a hundred years ago. For an  English-Dutch interpreter the thorough knowledge of the vernacular is  essential. Preachers and teachers have to adapt their speech by  combining High Dutch with the dialect, the one or the other  predominating according to the capacity of the hearers. Hollanders  follow the same method when learning the vernacular Dutch.    In towns and villages, not only in the Colonies, but also in both  Republics, English is almost exclusively used. The Boers, and especially  the younger generation, have a much greater aptitude and penchant for  learning English than for High Dutch; and generally it has been held  more important by the parents that their children should become  proficient in English, that language being more easily acquired and of  vastly greater use than Dutch. The latter, it was truly averred, would  be learnt as they grew up quite sufficiently for all purposes.    The feeling thus existed some twenty years ago that English would become  general, and ultimately oust both Dutch and the vernacular. Numerous  Boer patriots then devised the remedy of preserving the vernacular by  raising it to the standard of a written and printed language for  official as well as common use. The Rev. du Toit, later appointed  Minister (or Superintendent) of Education in the Transvaal, worked  tenaciously towards making that movement a national success. He had the  co-operation of many other educated patriots likewise. The _Paarl  Patriot_, a journal published in the vernacular, is one of the  surviving efforts. Vocabularies, school books, etc., etc., were printed  in that dialect, and the translation of the Bible had also been brought  to an advanced stage, when the project had to be abandoned, principally  through Hollander influence, aided by some of the Republican leaders and  Bond men. Dr. Mansfeld, the present Superintendent of Education in the  Transvaal, was subsequently appointed--a very able Hollander, but also a  very strong advocate in the general Hollander Bond movement for  proscribing the use of the English language, and making High Dutch the  compulsory medium of instruction. Since then, and during the past ten  years, considerable progress has been made by the average Boer children,  and even the grown-up people, in approaching a better knowledge of High  Dutch. Before 1880 hardly any Boer cared to read a newspaper except,  perhaps, the _Paarl Patriot_, the vernacular journal referred to. High  Dutch and English papers were equally beyond his ready knowledge, but  since then the interest in politics gave an impulse to a reading  tendency, and at this moment the majority of the Boers manage to read  and understand fairly well what is presented in simply written High  Dutch by the local Press. They also are fond of simply written books of  travels, and especially of narratives of a religious trend. With the  Bible they are most familiar from childhood, but literature in High  Dutch is beyond them as yet. Greater pains have of late years been taken  to qualify Boer sons for the administrative service of the Republics,  where imperfect knowledge of High Dutch is an obvious bar to  advancement, and Hollanders would otherwise continue to monopolize the  better positions.    Taking the fairly educated Free State and Transvaal youth, the average  proficiency in English compared to that in High Dutch is as two to one,  whilst many possess even a literary mastery in English whilst quite poor  in the other language.    In the Cape Colony the above comparison among the Boer section is still  more in favour of English.    It may be judged what an important _role_ the educated Hollander group  can take in those Republics, and are yet aiming at in the Colonies.    It is also worthy of reflection why and how the Dutch language has been  raised to equality with English in the Cape Colony, seeing English was  more generally understood by the Boers there than High Dutch, and none  of the Boer legislators or members of Parliament even now know more  than the Dutch vernacular, the High Dutch language having actually yet  to be learnt by the Boer population--an important step thus gained by  Afrikanerdom under the indulgent aegis of self-government, the thin end  of another wedge to nurse sedition and treason introduced by that odious  Bond under pretence and veil of Boer patriotism and loyalty.    As one of the world's languages, Dutch figures under a very sorry _role_  indeed. It had been ignored everywhere outside of Holland and her  distant Colonies. The consequence to Hollanders is that they are of  necessity subjected to the ordeal of learning several other continental  languages for commercial intercourse, and in order to keep at all  abreast with the progress of science, literature, and culture. Dutch is  in the moribund stage; its salvation from imminent extinction consists  in the expansion of its sphere. Boer successes in South Africa would  just accomplish that.
