But the young Ghazi, secretly instigated by the weak  and anxious monarch, renewed against the Persian the same war of  Turan and Iran, of Sunni and Shia, which in the last reign had  been waged between the uncle of the one and the grandfather of  the other. The only difference was that both parties being now  fully warned, the mask of friendship that had been maintained  during the old struggle was now completely dropped; and the  streets of the metropolis became the scene of daily fights  between the two factions. Many splendid remains of the old cities  are believed to have been destroyed during these struggles. The  Jats from Bhurtpore came up under Suraj Mal, their celebrated  leader, and plundered the environs right and left. The Vazir's  people, the Persian partly, breached a bastion of the city wall,  and their victory seemed near at hand. But Mir Mannu, the famous  Viceroy of the Punjab  who was Ghazi's near kinsman  sent a  body of veterans to aid the Moghul cause; the account is  confused, but this seems to have turned the tide. The Moghuls, or  Turks, for the time won; and Ghazi assumed the command of the  army. The Vazirship was conferred on Intizam-ud-daulah the Khan  Khanan (a son of the deceased Kamr-ul-din, and young Ghazi's  cousin), while Safdar Jang falling into open rebellion, called  the Jats under Surajmal to his assistance. The Moghuls were thus  led to have recourse to the Mahrattas; and Holkar was even  engaged as a nominal partizan of the Empire, against his  co-religionists the Jats, and his former patron the Viceroy of  Audh. The latter, who was always more remarkable for sagacity  than for personal courage, soon retired to his own country, and  the hands of the conqueror Ghazi fell heavily upon the  unfortunate Jats.    The Khan Khanan and the Emperor now began to think that things  had gone far enough; and the former, who was acquainted with his  kinsman's unscrupulous mind and ruthless passions, persistently  withheld from him a siege-train which was required for the  reduction of Bhartpur, the Jat capital. The Emperor was thus in a  situation from which the utmost judgment in the selection of a  line of conduct was necessary for success, indeed for safety. The  gallant Mir Mannu, son of his father's old friend and servant  Kamar-uddin, was absent in the Panjab, engaged on the arduous  duty of keeping the Afghans in check. But his brother-in-law, the  Khan Khanan, was ready with alternative projects, of which each  was courageous and sensible. To call back Safdar Jung, and openly  acknowledge the cause of the Jats, would probably cost only one  campaign, well conceived and vigorously executed. On the other  hand, to support the Captain-General Ghazi honestly and without  reserve, would have secured immediate repose, whilst it crushed a  formidable Hindu power.    The irresolute voluptuary before whom these plans were laid could  decide manfully upon neither. He marched from Dehli with the  avowed intention of supporting the Captain-General, to whom he  addressed messages of encouragement. He at the same time wrote to  Surajmal, to whom he promised that he would fall upon the rear of  the army (his own !), upon the Jats making a sally from the  fortress in which they were besieged.    Safdar Jang not being applied to, remained sullenly aloof: the  Emperor's letter to the Jats fell into the hands of Ghazi-ud-din,  the Captain-General, who returned it to him with violent menaces.  The alarmed monarch began to fall back upon his capital, pursued  at a distance by his rebellious general. Holkar meanwhile  executed a sudden and independent attack upon the Imperial camp,  which he took and plundered at Sikundrabad, near Bolandshahr. The  ladies of the Emperor's family were robbed of everything, and  sent to Dehli in country carts. The Emperor and his minister lost  all heart, and fled precipitately into Dehli, where they had but  just time to take refuge in the palace, when they found  themselves rigorously invested.    Knowing the man with whom they had to deal, their last hope was  obviously in a spirited resistance, combined with an earnest  appeal to the Audh Viceroy and to the ruler of the Jats. And it  is on record in a trustworthy native history that such was the  tenor of the Vazir's advice to the Emperor. But the latter,  perhaps too sensible of the difficulties of this course from the  known hostility of Safdar Jang, and the great influence of  Ghazi-ud-din over the Moghul soldiery, rejected the bold counsel.  Upon this the Vazir retired to his own residence, which he  fortified, and the remaining adherents of the Emperor opened the  gates and made terms with the Captain-General. The latter then  invested himself with the official robes of the Vazirate (5th  June, 1754) and convened the Moghul Darbar, from which, with his  usual address, he contrived to obtain as a vote of the cabinet  what was doubtless the suggestion of his own unprincipled  ambition. \"This Emperor,\" said the assembled nobles, \"has shown  his unfitness for rule. He is unable to cope with the Mahrattas:  he is false and fickle towards his friends. Let him be deposed,  and a worthier son of Timur raised to the throne.\" This  resolution was immediately acted upon; the unfortunate monarch  was blinded and consigned to the State prison of Salim Garh,  adjoining the palace; and a son of Jahandar Shah, the competitor  of Farokhsiar, proclaimed Emperor under the sounding title of  Alamgir II., July, 1754 A.D. The new Emperor (whose title was due  to the fact that his predecessor  the great Aurangzeb  had been  the first to bear it) was in the fifty-fourth year of his age. He  was a quiet old devotee, whose only pleasures were reading  religious books and attending divine service. His predecessor was  not further molested, and lived on in his captivity to his death  in 1775, from natural causes, at the age of fifty. Ghazi-ud-din  was at the same time acknowledged as Vazir in the room of the  Khan Khanan. That officer was murdered about five years later,  according to Beale (Orl. Bl. Dicty in voc.) So also the  Siyar-ul-mutikharin.    One name, afterwards to become very famous, is heard of for the  first time during these transactions; and, since the history of  the Empire consists now of little more than a series of  biographies, the present seems the proper place to consider the  outset of his career. Najib Khan was an Afghan soldier of  fortune, who had attained the hand of the daughter of Dundi Khan,  one of the chieftains of the Rohilkand Pathans. Rewarded by this  ruler with the charge of a district, now Bijnaur, in the  north-west corner of Rohilkand, he had joined the cause of Safdar  Jang, when that minister occupied the country; but on the  latter's disgrace had borne a part in the campaigns of  Ghazi-ud-din. When the Vazir first conceived the project of  attacking the government, he sent Najib in the command of a  Moghul detachment to occupy the country, about Saharanpur, then  known as the Bawani mahal, which had formed the jagir of the  Ex-Vazir Khan Khanan. This territory thus became in its turn  separated from the Empire, and continued for two generations in  the family of Najib. Though possessing the unscrupulous nature of  his class, he was not without the virtues that are found in its  best specimens. He was active, painstaking, and faithful to  engagements; when he had surmounted his early difficulties he  proved a good administrator. He ruled the dwindled Empire for  nine years, and died a peaceful death, leaving his charge in an  improved and strengthened condition, ready for its lawful  monarch. He was highly esteemed by the British in India. (v. inf  89 )    The dominions of Akbar and Aurangzeb had now indeed fallen into a  pitiable state. Although the whole of the peninsula still  nominally owned the sway of the Moghul, no provinces remained in  the occupation of the Government besides part of the upper Doab,  and a few districts south of the Satlaj. Gujarat was overrun by  the Mahrattas; Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa were occupied by the  successor of Aliverdi Khan, Audh and Allahabad by Safdar Jang,  the central Doab by the Afghan tribe of Bangash, the province now  called Rohilkand by the Rohillas. The Panjab had been virtually  abandoned; the rest of India had been recovered by the Hindus,  with the exception of such portions of the Deccan as still formed  the arena for the family wars of the sons of the old Nizam. Small  encroachments continued to be made by the English traders.        CHAPTER V    A.D. 1754-60.        Progress of Ghazi ud-din  Ahmad Khan enters Dehli  Escape of  the Prince Ali Gauhar  Murder of the Emperor  Ahmad the Abdali  advances on Dehli  End of Ghazi's career.    No sooner was the revolution accomplished than the young  kingmaker took effective measures to secure his position. He  first seized and imprisoned his relation the Khan Khanan, whose  office he had usurped, as above stated. The opportune death of  Safdar Jang (17th October, 1754) removed another danger, while  the intrepidity and merciless severity with which (assisted by  Najib Khan) he quelled a military mutiny provoked by his own  arbitrary conduct, served at once as a punishment to the  miserable offenders and a warning to all who might be meditating  future attacks.    Of such there were not a few, and those too in high places. The  imbecile Emperor became the willing centre of a cabal bent upon  the destruction of the daring young minister; and, though the  precautions of the latter prevented things from going that  length, yet the constant plotting that went on served to  neutralize all his efforts at administration, and to increase in  his mind that sense of misanthropic solitude which is probably  the starting-point of the greatest crimes.    As soon as he judged that he could prudently leave the Court, the  Minister organized an expedition to the Panjab,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#7)"],[1,"man could not adopt it--it could not mix with his blood. It  looked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers  overboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded  shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing. And besides this, the  benefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too  remote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf. Few can be  induced to labour exclusively for posterity; and none will do it  enthusiastically. Posterity has done nothing for us; and theorize on it  as we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are  made to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves.    What an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit, to ask or expect a  whole community to rise up and labour for the temporal happiness of  others, after themselves shall be consigned to the dust, a majority of  which community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal  welfare at no more distant day! Great distance in either time or space  has wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.  Pleasures to be enjoyed, or pains to be endured, after we shall be dead  and gone, are but little regarded even in our own cases, and much less  in the cases of others. Still, in addition to this there is something so  ludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to  render the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned  into ridicule. \"Better lay down that spade you are stealing, Paddy; if  you don't you'll pay for it at the day of judgment.\" \"Be the powers, if  ye'll credit me so long I'll take another jist.\"          _From the Circular of the Whig Committee. An Address to the People of  Illinois. March 4, 1843_      ... The system of loans is but temporary in its nature, and must soon  explode. It is a system not only ruinous while it lasts, but one that  must soon fail and leave us destitute.    As an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his  original means devoured by interest, and next, no one left to borrow  from, so must it be with a government.    We repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax,  must soon be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is  now denied by no one. But which system shall be adopted? Some of our  opponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for  revenue, but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff;  while others boldly advocate direct taxation. Inasmuch, therefore, as  some of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest--or so  nearly all as to make exceptions needless--refuse to adopt the tariff,  we think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of  direct taxation. Indeed, we believe they are only delaying an open  avowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people  will tolerate it. Let us, then, briefly compare the two systems. The  tariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in  large parcels, at a few commercial points, will require comparatively  few officers in their collection; while by the direct tax system the  land must be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going  forth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass  and other green thing. And, again, by the tariff system the whole  revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the  luxuries and not the necessaries of life. By this system, the man who  contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays  nothing at all. And surely that country is extensive enough, and its  products abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its  people. In short, by this system the burden of revenue falls almost  entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and  labouring many, who live at home and upon home products, go entirely  free. By the direct tax system, none can escape. However strictly the  citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries, fine cloths,  fine silks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,--still, for  the possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun he is to be  perpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer. With these views,  we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are more truly  democratic on the subject.          _From a Letter to Martin M. Morris. Springfield, Illinois. March 26,  1843_      It is truly gratifying to me to learn that while the people of Sangamon  have cast me off, my old friends of Menard, who have known me longest  and best, stick to me. It would astonish, if not amuse, the older  citizens to learn that I (a stranger, friendless, uneducated, penniless  boy, working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month) have been put down  here as the candidate of pride, wealth, and aristocratic family  distinction. Yet so, chiefly, it was. There was, too, the strangest  combination of church influence against me. Baker is a Campbellite; and  therefore, as I suppose, with few exceptions, got all that church. My  wife has some relations in the Presbyterian churches, and some with the  Episcopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would tell, I was set  down as either the one or the other, while it was everywhere contended  that no Christian ought to go for me, because I belonged to no church,  was suspected of being a deist, and had talked about fighting a duel.  With all these things, Baker, of course, had nothing to do. Nor do I  complain of them. As to his own church going for him, I think that was  right enough, and as to the influences I have spoken of in the other,  though they were very strong, it would be grossly untrue and unjust to  charge that they acted upon them in a body, or were very near so. I only  mean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent. upon  my strength throughout the religious controversy. But enough of this.          _From a Letter to Joshua F. Speed. Springfield. October 22, 1846_      We have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a  child as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is \"short and  low,\" and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly--almost as  plainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he  is one of the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than  ever after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the  offspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger  came to tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I reached the house his  mother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is  run away again.          _From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. January 8, 1848_      Dear William, Your letter of December 27th was received a day or two  ago. I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and  promise to take in my little business there. As to speech-making, by way  of getting the hang of the House, I made a little speech two or three  days ago on a post-office question of no general interest. I find  speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing. I was about as badly  scared, and no worse, as I am when I speak in court. I expect to make  one within a week or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish  you to see it.    It is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire  that I should be re-elected. I most heartily thank them for their  partiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas,  that \"personally I would not object\" to a re-election, although I  thought at the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me  to return to the law at the end of a single term. I made the declaration  that I would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly  with others, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district  from going to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that,  if it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could  refuse the people the right of sending me again. But to enter myself as  a competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me, is what  my word and honour forbid.            _From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. June 22, 1848_      As to the young men. You must not wait to be brought forward by the  older men. For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into  notice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men?  You young men get together and form a \"Rough and Ready Club,\" and have  regular meetings and speeches. Take in everybody you can get. Harrison  Grimsley, L.A. Enos, Lee Kimball and C.W. Matheny will do to begin the  thing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about  town, whether just of age or a little under age--Chris. Logan, Reddick  Ridgley, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such. Let every one play the part  he can play best,--some speak, some sing, and all \"holler.\" Your  meetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will go to  hear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of \"Old  Zach,\" but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the  intellectual faculties of all engaged. Don't fail to do this.          _From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington, July 10, 1848_      The way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can,  never suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure  you that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation.  There may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and  they will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its  true channel to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about, and see if  this feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall  into it.            _Letter to"]]]
