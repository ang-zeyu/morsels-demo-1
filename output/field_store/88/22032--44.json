After cleaning it nicely, saw the bone down the middle of the skull, but  do not separate the head, take out the brains and tongue, boil it tender  enough to remove the bones, which must be taken entirely out; lay it on  a board, have a good quantity of chopped parsley seasoned with mace,  nutmeg, pepper and salt--spread a layer of this, then one of thick  slices of ham, another of parsley and one of ham, roll it up tight, sew  a cloth over it, and bind that round with tape; boil it half an hour,  and when cold press it. It must be kept covered with vinegar and water,  and is very delicious eaten with sallad or oil and vinegar.           *       *       *       *       *    CALF'S HEART, A NICE DISH.    Take the heart and liver from the harslet, and cut off the windpipe,  boil the lights very tender, and cut them in small pieces--take as much  of the water they were boiled in as will be sufficient for gravy; add to  it a large spoonful of white wine, one of lemon pickle, some grated  nutmeg, pepper and salt, with a large spoonful of butter, mixed with one  of white flour; let it boil a few minutes, and put in the minced lights,  set it by till the heart and liver are ready, cut the ventricle out of  the heart, wash it well, lard it all over with narrow slips of middling,  fill the cavity with good forcemeat, put it in a pan on the broad end,  that the stuffing may not come out; bake it a nice brown, slice the  liver an inch thick and broil it, make the mince hot, set the heart  upright in the middle of the dish, pour it around, lay the broiled liver  on, and garnish with bunches of fried parsley; it should be served up  extremely hot.           *       *       *       *       *    CALF'S FEET FRICASSEE.    Boil the feet till very tender, cut them in two and pull out the large  bones, have half a pint of good white gravy, add to it a spoonful of  white wine, one of lemon pickle, and some salt, with a tea-spoonful of  curry powder, stew the feet in it fifteen minutes, and thicken it with  the yelks of two eggs, a gill of milk, a large spoonful of butter, and  two of white flour, let the thickening be very smooth, shake the stew  pan over the fire a few minutes, but do not let it boil lest the eggs  and milk should curdle.           *       *       *       *       *    TO FRY CALF'S FEET.    Prepare them as for the fricassee, dredge them well with flour and fry  them a light brown, pour parsley and butter over, and garnish with fried  parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    TO PREPARE RENNET.    Take the stomach from the calf as soon as it is killed--do not wash it,  but hang it in a dry cool place for four or five days; then turn it  inside out, slip off all the curd nicely with the hand, fill it with a  little saltpetre mixed with the quantity of salt necessary, and lay it  in a small stone pot, pour over it a small tea-spoonful of vinegar, and  sprinkle a handful of salt over it, cover it closely and keep it for  use. You must not wash it--that would weaken the gastric juice, and  injure the rennet. After it has been salted six or eight weeks, cut off  a piece four or five inches long, put it in a large mustard bottle, or  any vessel that will hold about a pint and a half; put on it five gills  of cold water, and two gills of rose brandy--stop it very close, and  shake it when you are going to use it: a table-spoonful of this is  sufficient for a quart of milk. It must be prepared in very cool  weather, and if well done, will keep more than a year.           *       *       *       *       *    TO HASH A CALF'S HEAD.    Boil the head till the meat is almost enough for eating; then cut it in  thin slices, take three quarters of a pint of good gravy, and add half a  pint of white wine, half a nutmeg, two anchovies, a small onion stuck  with cloves, and a little mace; boil these up in the liquor for a  quarter of an hour, then strain it and boil it up again; put in the  meat, with salt to your taste, let it stew a little, and if you choose  it, you may add some sweetbreads, and make some forcemeat balls with  veal; mix the brains with the yelks of eggs and fry them to lay for a  garish. When the head is ready to be sent in, stir in a bit of butter.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BAKE A CALF'S HEAD.    Divide the calf's head, wash it clean, and having the yelks of two eggs  well beaten, wash the outside of the head all over with them, and on  that strew raspings of bread sifted, pepper, salt, nutmeg and mace  powdered; also, the brains cut in pieces and dipped in thick butter,  then cover the head with bits of butter, pour into the pan some white  wine and water, with as much gravy, and cover it close. Let it be baked  in a quick oven, and when it is served up, pour on some strong gravy,  and garnish with slices of lemon, red beet root pickled, fried oysters  and fried bread.           *       *       *       *       *    TO STUFF AND ROAST A CALF'S LIVER.    Take a fresh calf's liver, and having made a hole in it with a large  knife run in lengthways, but not quite through, have ready a forced  meat, or stuffing made of part of the liver parboiled, fat of bacon  minced very fine, and sweet herbs powdered; add to these some grated  bread and spice finely powdered, with pepper and salt. With this  stuffing fill the hole in the liver, which must be larded with fat  bacon, and then roasted, flouring it well, and basting with butter till  it is enough. This is to be served up hot, with gravy sauce having a  little wine in it.           *       *       *       *       *    TO BROIL CALF'S LIVER.    Cut it in slices, put over it salt and pepper; broil it nicely, and pour  on some melted butter with chopped parsley after it is dished.           *       *       *       *       *    _ Directions for cleaning Calf's Head and Feet, for those who live in  the country and butcher their own meats._    As soon as the animal is killed, have the head and feet taken off, wash  them clean, sprinkle some pounded rosin all over the hairs, then dip  them in boiling water, take them instantly out, the rosin will dry  immediately, and they may be scraped clean with ease; the feet should be  soaked in water three or four days, changing it daily; this will make  them very white.           *       *       *       *       *      LAMB.      TO ROAST THE FORE-QUARTER, &c.    The fore-quarter should always be roasted and served with mint sauce in  a boat; chop the mint small and mix it with vinegar enough to make it  liquid, sweeten it with sugar.    The hind-quarter may be boiled or roasted, and requires mint sauce; it  may also be dressed in various ways.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED LAMB.    Cut the shank bone from a hind-quarter, separate the joints of the loin,  lay it in a pan with the kidney uppermost, sprinkle some pepper and  salt, add a few cloves of garlic, a pint of water and a dozen large ripe  tomatoes with the skins taken off, bake it but do not let it be burnt,  thicken the gravy with a little butter and brown flour.           *       *       *       *       *    FRIED LAMB.    Separate the leg from the loin, cut off the shank and boil the leg;  divide the loin in chops, dredge and fry them a nice brown, lay the leg  in the middle of the dish, and put the chops around, pour over parsley  and butter, and garnish with fried parsley.    The leg cut into steaks and the loin into chops will make a fine  fricassee, or cutlets.           *       *       *       *       *    TO DRESS LAMB'S HEAD AND FEET.    Clean them very nicely, and boil them till tender, take off the flesh  from the head with the eyes, also mince the tongue and heart, which must  be boiled with the head; split the feet in two, put them with the pieces  from the head and the mince, into a pint of good gravy, seasoned with  pepper, salt, and tomato catsup, or ripe tomatoes: stew it till tender,  thicken the gravy, and lay the liver cut in slices and broiled over  it--garnish with crisp parsley and bits of curled bacon.           *       *       *       *       *    MUTTON.    The saddle should always be roasted and garnished with scraped  horse-radish. See general observations on roasting. Mutton is in the  highest perfection from August until Christmas, when it begins to  decline in goodness.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED LEG OF MUTTON.    Cut off the shank, wrap the flank nicely round and secure it with  skewers, dredge it well with flour, and put it on the fire in a kettle  of cold water with some salt, and three or four heads of garlic, which  will give it a delicately fine flavour; skin it well, and when nearly  done, take it from the fire and keep it hot and closely covered, that  the steam may finish it; have carrots well boiled to put in the dish  under it, or turnips boiled, mashed smooth and stewed with a lump of  butter and salt, lay the mutton on, and pour over it butter melted with  some flour in it, and a cup full of capers with some of the vinegar;  shake them together over the fire till hot before you pour it on.           *       *       *       *       *    ROASTED LEG.    Prepare it as for boiling, be very careful in spitting it, cover it with  paper and follow the directions for roasting, serve it up garnished with  scraped horse-radish.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED LEG OF MUTTON.    Take the flank off, but leave all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#7)"],[1,"disgusting view of human skulls and  thigh bones lining its walls. The thigh bones form a cross, and the skulls  are placed in each of the four angles.    Nature has been very bountiful in her favours to Madeira; its soil is rich  and various, and its climate is salubrious and versatile; it abounds in  natural productions, and only requires the fostering hand of the husbandman  to produce every necessary, and almost luxury, of life. Walnuts, chesnuts,  and apples, flourish in the hills, almost spontaneously, and guanas,  mangoes, and bananas, in wild exuberance. At the country residence of James  Gordon, Esq. where we dined, and met with the most distinguished  hospitality, I saw a most surprising instance of rapid growth; a shoot of  the tree, called the Limbriera Royal, started up, perpendicularly from the  trunk, to a height of nearly _thirty feet_, from the month of January to  that of October: it is, however, to be observed, that the branches were  lopped off, and it is supposed the juices of the trunk communicated to this  stem.    Corn of a very good quality grows in this island, and might be produced in  plenty, but the inhabitants, whose characteristic is idleness, neglect its  culture, and thereby subject themselves to the necessity of relying upon  foreign imports. Their beef, mutton, and pork, are remarkably good, and  they have game in the mountains.    By order of the late governor, in 1800, the population was taken from the  confessional returns, and, as he was himself a bishop, it may be inferred  that the number stated below, which I procured from official authority, is  accurate, viz.         Number confessed,                                     95,000   And, calculating 1 in 10 for children under 5   years of age, the first period of their confession,   is equal to                                            3,500                                                       --------   Making in the aggregate the number of souls to be    104,500                                                       --------        15,000 of whom were computed to be inhabitants of the town of Funchal.    The government consists of a governor, appointed by the crown of Portugal,  the island being in its possession, styled governor of the islands, and: is  perfectly arbitrary; Funchal is his residence; he has a council under him  consisting of 24 members, whose president is the second judge for the time  being. All officers are nominated by the crown, and the holders continue  only for three years, at the end of which new nominations take place.    The only article of trade is wine, of which they export about 12,000 pipes  annually, and consume from 6 to 8,000 pipes in the island, comprehending  _small wine_, &c. being in the whole about 20,000 pipes. It is made by  pressing out the juice from the grape in a wooden vessel, proportioned in  size to the quantity they intend to make. The wine-pressers take off their  jackets and stockings, get into the vessel, and with their elbows and feet  press as much of the juice as is practicable by this operation; the stalks  are then tied together and pressed, under a square piece of wood, by a  lever with a stone fastened to the end of it; the wine is brought from the  country in goat skins, by men and women on their heads.    The roads are so steep and roughly paved, that neither carriages nor carts  are in use, the substitute is a palanquin for the former, and for the  latter a hollow log of wood, drawn by oxen, upon which the wine vessels or  other loads are placed; they, however, have horses and mules very well  adapted to their roads.    The revenue to the crown of Portugal is estimated from 20 to 30,000_l_.  annually, clear of all expenses; but the balance of trade is greatly  against them, all their specie being drawn to Lisbon.    The currency of the island is Spanish, and consists of dollars, converted  by their laws, into milreas of 5_s_. 6_d_. pistareens, value about is.  bits, about 6_d_. and half bits, about 3_d_.    It is disadvantageous to take up money at Madeira upon bills, as they make  payment in dollars, which they value at a milrea. Sometimes they may, from  particular circumstances, give a premium, but it is seldom equal to the  discount.    On the morning of the 18th I bad my grateful adieu to Madeira, and the  friendly roof of Mr. Wardrope and his united family, the abode of conjugal  affection, friendship, and hospitable reception; and at 2 P.M. went on  board. We weighed anchor under the protection of the Favorite, the Arab  continuing at her moorings. Passing between the grand Canary and close in  with Teneriffe, we arrived safe at the island of Goree, on the 5th of  November, without our commodore, under convoy of the Favorite. The ship  Andersons having freight to deliver at that island, we continued there  until the 12th, and again resumed our voyage; arriving, without accident;  at Bance Island, which I have previously noticed, on the 22d of the same  month.    My residence was confined to this island, and in excursions through the  neighbouring countries, until the 4th June, 1806, during which period, and  from a general intercourse with an extended circle of chiefs, natives, and  traders, I have been enabled to decide upon the situation of this country,  and to form a conclusive opinion of the condition and character of its  inhabitants, and its commercial resources.    From these sources of intelligence, and the example this island displayed,  with observations upon the conduct and management of the Sierra Leone  company, I first conceived the system that I shall hereafter delineate,  upon which the African's  condition may be effectually improved, and his  hereditary slavery exterminated.        [Illustration: BANCE ISLAND, in the RIVER SIERRA LEONE. _The Property of  John & Alexander Anderson Esq. London._]        The natives of Africa resident upon the coast, are uniformly considered as  more ferocious and barbarous in their customs and manners, less numerous in  population, and more encroaching and deceitful, than those of the interior.  While this formidable opposition exists, and the baneful influence of  barbarous habits continues, it is in vain to look to remuneration by  natural commerce, or to the establishment of civilization. The African's  barbarity must be first here assailed, and the infinite resources upon the  coasts and maritime rivers must be developed to his view, to pre-dispose  him to refine his condition, and adopt the civilized habits of life; nor is  there any site which I have met with upon the Windward Coast of Africa,  more calculated to promote this beneficent undertaking, than the island of  Bance, from its locality of situation, being central to windward and  leeward operation, commanding an extensive circle of interior country, and  being long established in the estimation of the natives of an extended  district. But more of this subject in order.        CHAPTER V.          _Observations upon the natural Productions of the River Sierra Leone.--The  Author explores its Branches, interior to Bance Island, the Rochelle, and  the Port Logo.--The Manners and Customs of the Inhabitants.--Their  Commerce.--The Author's safe Arrival at Miffare._      The river of Sierra Leone abounds in fish, and the spermaceti whale has  been occasionally found, the shark, the porpoise, eels, mackarel, mullet,  snappers, yellow tails, cavillos, tenpounders, &c. with the _mannittee_, a  singular mass of shapeless flesh, having much the taste of beef, which the  natives greatly esteem, and consider the highest offering they can make.    Oysters are found in great abundance, attached to the interwoven twigs and  branches of the mangrove tree, to which they closely cling; and of the  zoophytes, there is the common sponge to be found upon the sandy beaches,  on the Boolum shore, and would, no doubt, bring a high price in England.    The domestic animals of the adjoining countries are, cattle, sheep, goats,  hogs, ducks, turkeys, and fowls, very inferior, however, to those in  Europe. The beasts of prey are, lions, leopards, hyaenas, wild hogs in  abundance, squirrels, monkies, antelopes, &c. with the civet and zibeth  cats, and a most extraordinary animal, which is found in the mountains of  Sierra Leone and the adjacent countries, a species of the ourang outang,  called by the natives, japanzee, or chimpanzee, but approaching nearer to  the anatomy of the human frame than the former animal. Some of them, when  full grown, are nearly 5 feet, and are covered with black hair, long on the  back, but thin and short upon the belly and breast; the face is quite bare,  and the hands and feet resemble those of man; its countenance is remarkably  grave, similar to that of an old black man, but its ears are straight; it  will imitate a human being in walking, sleeping, eating, and drinking, and  is certainly a most singular production of nature. Surgeon Burrowes, whom I  have before mentioned, had a perfect skeleton of this animal, which, he  assured me, differed in nothing from the human, but in the spine, it being  curved. This skeleton, I believe, now forms a part of the collection of  Surgeon-General Keate.    There are, of amphibious animals, green turtles, hawk's bills, and  loggerheads, which grow to a great size, some of them weighing several  hundred pounds, land turtles, fresh water turtles, alligators, extremely  voracious, and from 12 to 15 feet in length; they will swallow a man, and  at Bance Island Negro boys have been frequently snatched up by them from  the shore. There are also a variety of the lizard species, with the guava,  and camelion.    Snakes abound; some of them haunt the houses in the night, and prowl about  for poultry, of which they are fond; some have been found to measure above  18 feet; and I have the skin of one in my possession, killed when young,  above 10 feet in length; it is that species which swallows its prey"]]]
