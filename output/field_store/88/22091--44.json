Domenico, Fiesole, a few frescoes, less fine than  those in S. Marco; also an altarpiece in tempera of the Virgin and  Child between Saints Peter, Thomas Aquinas, Dominic and Peter Martyr,  now much destroyed. The subject which originally formed the predella  of this picture has, since 1860, been in the National Gallery, London,  and worthily represents there the hand of the saintly painter. The  subject is a Glory, Christ with the banner of the Resurrection, and  a multitude of saints, including, at the extremities, the saints or  beati of the Dominican order; here are no fewer than 266 figures  or portions of figures, many of them having names inscribed. This  predella was highly lauded by Vasari; still more highly another  picture which used to form an altarpiece in Fiesole, and which now  obtains world-wide celebrity in the Louvre--the \"Coronation of the  Virgin,\" with eight predella subjects of the miracles of St. Dominic.  For the church of Santa Trinita, Florence, Angelico executed a  \"Deposition from the Cross,\" and for the church of the Angeli, a \"Last  Judgment,\" both now in the Florentine academy; for S. Maria Novella, a  \"Coronation of the Virgin,\" with a predella in three sections, now  in the Uffizi,--this again is one of his masterpieces. In Orvieto  cathedral he painted three triangular divisions of the ceiling,  portraying respectively Christ in a glory of angels, sixteen saints  and prophets, and the virgin and apostles: all these are now much  repainted and damaged. In Rome, in the Chapel of Nicholas V., the acts  of Saints Stephen and Lawrence; also various figures of saints, and  on the ceiling the four evangelists. These works of the painter's  advanced age, which have suffered somewhat from restorations, show  vigour superior to that of his youth, along with a more adequate  treatment of the architectural perspectives. Naturally, there are a  number of works currently attributed to Angelico, but not really his;  for instance, a \"St Thomas with the Madonna's girdle,\" in the Lateran  museum, and a \"Virgin enthroned,\" in the church of S. Girolamo,  Fiesole. It has often been said that he commenced and frequently  practised as an illuminator; this is dubious and a presumption arises  that illuminations executed by Giovanni's brother, Benedetto, also  a Dominican, who died in 1448, have been ascribed to the more famous  artist. Benedetto may perhaps have assisted Giovanni in the frescoes  at S. Marco, but nothing of the kind is distinctly traceable. A folio  series of engravings from these paintings was published in Florence,  in 1852. Along with Gozzoli already mentioned, Zanobi Strozzi and  Gentile da Fabriano are named as pupils of the Beato.    We have spoken of Angelico's art as \"pietistic\"; this is in fact  its predominant character. His visages have an air of rapt suavity,  devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is  intensely attractive to some minds and realizes beyond rivalry a  particular ideal--that of ecclesiastical saintliness and detachment  from secular fret and turmoil. It should not be denied that he did not  always escape the pitfalls of such a method of treatment, the faces  becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which  hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; on other minds,  therefore, and these some of the most masculine and resolute, he  produces little genuine impression. After allowing for this, Angelico  should nevertheless be accepted beyond cavil as an exalted typical  painter according to his own range of conceptions, consonant with his  monastic calling, unsullied purity of life and exceeding devoutness.  Exquisite as he is in his special mode of execution, he undoubtedly  falls far short, not only of his great naturalist contemporaries such  as Masaccio and Lippo Lippi, but even of so distant a precursor as  Giotto, in all that pertains to bold or life-like invention of a  subject or the realization of ordinary appearances, expressions and  actions--the facts of nature, as distinguished from the aspirations or  contemplations of the spirit. Technically speaking, he had much finish  and harmony of composition and colour, without corresponding  mastery of light and shade, and his knowledge of the human frame  was restricted. The brilliancy and fair light scale of his tints  is constantly remarkable, combined with a free use of gilding; this  conduces materially to that celestial character which so pre-eminently  distinguishes his pictured visions of the divine persons, the  hierarchy of heaven and the glory of the redeemed.    [v.02 p.0008]    Books regarding Fra Angelico are numerous. We may mention those by S.  Beissel, 1895; V.M. Crawford, 1900; R.L. Douglas, 1900; I.B. Supino,  1901; D. Tumiati, 1897; G. Williamson, 1901.    (W.M.R.)        ANGELL, GEORGE THORNDIKE (1823-1909), American philanthropist, was  born at Southbridge, Massachusetts, on the 5th of June 1823. He  graduated at Dartmouth in 1846, studied law at the Harvard Law School,  and in 1851 was admitted to the bar in Boston, where he practised  for many years. In 1868 he founded and became president of the  Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in the  same year establishing and becoming editor of _Our Dumb Animals_, a  journal for the promotion of organized effort in securing the humane  treatment of animals. For many years he was active in the organization  of humane societies in England and America. In 1882 he initiated the  movement for the establishment of Bands of Mercy (for the promotion  of humane treatment of animals), of which in 1908 there were more than  72,000 in active existence. In 1889 he founded and became president  of the American Humane Education Society. He became well known as a  criminologist and also as an advocate of laws for the safeguarding of  the public health and against adulteration of food. He died at Boston  on the 16th of March 1909.        ANGEL-LIGHTS, in architecture, the outer upper lights in a  perpendicular window, next to the springing; probably a corruption of  the word angle-lights, as they are nearly triangular.        ANGELUS, a Roman Catholic devotion in memory of the Annunciation.  It has its name from the opening words, _Angelus Domini nuntiavit  Mariae_. It consists of three texts describing the mystery, recited  as versicle and response alternately with the salutation \"Hail, Mary!\"  This devotion is recited in the Catholic Church three times daily,  about 6 A.M., noon and 6 P.M. At these hours a bell known as the  Angelus bell is rung. This is still rung in some English country  churches, and has often been mistaken for and alleged to be a survival  of the curfew bell. The institution of the Angelus is by some ascribed  to Pope Urban II., by some to John XXII. The triple recitation is  ascribed to Louis XI. of France, who in 1472 ordered it to be thrice  said daily.        ANGELUS SILESIUS (1624-1677), German religious poet, was born in 1624  at Breslau. His family name was Johann Scheffler, but he is generally  known by the pseudonym Angelus Silesius, under which he published his  poems and which marks the country of his birth. Brought up a Lutheran,  and at first physician to the duke of Wuerttemberg-Oels, he joined in  1652 the Roman Catholic Church, in 1661 took orders as a priest, and  became coadjutor to the prince bishop of Breslau. He died at Breslau  on the 9th of July 1677. In 1657 Silesius published under the title  _Heilige Seelenlust, oder geistliche Hirtenlieder der in ihren  Jesum verliebten Psyche_ (1657), a collection of 205 hymns, the most  beautiful of which, such as, _Liebe, die du mich zum Bilde deiner  Gottheit hast gemacht_ and _Mir nach, spricht Christus, unser Held_,  have been adopted in the German Protestant hymnal. More remarkable,  however, is his _Geistreiche Sinn-und Schluss-reime_ (1657),  afterwards called _Cherubinischer Wandersmann_ (1674). This is a  collection of \"Reimsprueche\" or rhymed distichs embodying a strange  mystical pantheism drawn mainly from the writings of Jakob Boehme and  his followers. Silesius delighted specially in the subtle paradoxes of  mysticism. The essence of God, for instance, he held to be love; God,  he said, can love nothing inferior to himself; but he cannot be an  object of love to himself without going out, so to speak, of himself,  without manifesting his infinity in a finite form; in other words, by  becoming man. God and man are therefore essentially one.    A complete edition of Scheffler's works (_Saemtliche poetische Werke_)  was published by D.A. Rosenthal, 2 vols. (Regensburg, 1862). Both  the _Cherubinischer Wandersmann_ and _Heilige Seelenlust_ have been  republished by G. Ellinger (1895 and 1901); a selection from the  former work by O.E. Hartleben (1896). For further notices of Silesius'  life and work, see Hoffmann von Fallersleben in _Weimarisches Jahrbuch  I_. (Hanover, 1854); A. Kahlert, _Angelus Silesius_ (1853); C.  Seltmann, _Angelus Silesius und seine Mystik_ (1896), and a biog. by  H. Mahn (Dresden, 1896).        ANGERMUeNDE, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of  Brandenburg, on Lake Muende, 43 m. from Berlin by the Berlin-Stettin  railway, and at the junction of lines to Prenzlau, Freien-walde and  Schwedt. Pop. (1900) 7465. It has three Protestant churches, a grammar  school and court of law. Its industries embrace iron founding and  enamel working. In 1420 the elector Frederick I. of Brandenburg gained  here a signal victory over the Pomeranians.        ANGERONA, or ANGERONIA, an old Roman goddess, whose name and functions  are variously explained. According to ancient authorities, she was a  goddess who relieved men from pain and sorrow, or delivered the Romans  and their flocks from _angina_ (quinsy); or she was the protecting  goddess of Rome and the keeper of the sacred name of the city, which  might not be pronounced lest it should be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#7)"],[1,"was made out of pine poles put together wid cords. Dem  wheat-straw mattresses was for grown folkses mostly 'cause nigh all de  chillun slept on pallets. How-some-ever, dere was some few slave chillun  what had beds to sleep on. Pillows! Dem days us never knowed what  pillows was. Gals slept on one side of de room and boys on de other in  de chilluns room. Uncle Jim, he was de bed-maker, and he made up a heap  of little beds lak what dey calls cots now.    \"Becky and Stafford Stephens was my Grandma and Grandpa. Marse Alec  bought 'em in Old Virginny. I don't know what my Grandma done 'cause she  died 'fore I was borned, but I 'members Grandpa Stafford well enough. I  can see him now. He was a old man what slept on a trundle bed in the  kitchen, and all he done was to set by de fire all day wid a switch in  his hand and tend de chillun whilst dere mammies was at wuk. Chillun  minded better dem days dan dey does now. Grandpa Stafford never had to  holler at 'em but one time. Dey knowed dey would git de switch next if  dey didn't behave.    \"Now dere you is axin' 'bout dat somepin' t'eat us had dem days! Ida,  ain't dere a piece of watermelon in de ice box?\" Georgia lifted the lid  of a small ice box, got out a piece of melon, and began to smack her  thick lips as she devoured it with an air of ineffable satisfaction.  When she had tilted the rind to swallow the last drop of pink juice, she  indicated that she was fortified and ready to exercise her now well  lubricated throat, by resuming her story:    \"Oh, yessum! Marse Alec, had plenty for his slaves to eat. Dere was  meat, bread, collard greens, snap beans, 'taters, peas, all sorts of  dried fruit, and just lots of milk and butter. Marse Alec had 12 cows  and dat's whar I learned to love milk so good. De same Uncle Jim what  made our beds made our wooden bowls what dey kept filled wid bread and  milk for de chillun all day. You might want to call dat place whar Marse  Alec had our veg'tables raised a gyarden, but it looked more lak a big  field to me, it was so big. You jus' ought to have seed dat dere  fireplace whar dey cooked all us had to eat. It was one sho 'nough big  somepin, all full of pots, skillets, and ovens. Dey warn't never 'lowed  to git full of smut neither. Dey had to be cleant and shined up atter  evvy meal, and dey sho was pretty hangin' dar in dat big old fireplace.    \"George and Mack was de hunters. When dey went huntin' dey brought back  jus' evvything: possums, rabbits, coons, squirrels, birds, and wild  turkeys. Yessum, wild turkeys is some sort of birds I reckon, but when  us talked about birds to eat us meant part'idges. Some folkses calls 'em  quails. De fishes us had in summertime was a sight to see. Us sho et  good dem days. Now us jus' eats what-some-ever us can git.    \"Summertime us jus' wore what us wanted to. Dresses was made wid full  skirts gathered on to tight fittin' waisties. Winter clothes was good  and warm; dresses made of yarn cloth made up jus' lak dem summertime  clothes, and petticoats and draw's made out of osnaburg. Chillun what  was big enough done de spinnin' and Aunt Betsey and Aunt Tinny, dey wove  most evvy night 'til dey rung de bell at 10:00 o'clock for us to go to  bed. Us made bolts and bolts of cloth evvy year.    \"Us went bar'foots in summer, but bless your sweet life us had good  shoes in winter and wore good stockin's too. It tuk three shoemakers for  our plantation. Dey was Uncle Isom, Uncle Jim, and Uncle Stafford. Dey  made up hole-stock shoes for de 'omans and gals and brass-toed brogans  for de mens and boys.    \"Us had pretty white dresses for Sunday. Marse Alec wanted evvybody on  his place dressed up dat day. He sont his houseboy, Uncle Harris, down  to de cabins evvy Sunday mornin' to tell evvy slave to clean hisself up.  Dey warn't never give no chance to forgit. Dere was a big old room sot  aside for a wash-room. Folkses laughs at me now 'cause I ain't never  stopped takin' a bath evvy Sunday mornin'.    \"Marse Lordnorth Stephens was de boss on Marse Alec's plantation. Course  Marse Alec owned us and he was our sho 'nough Marster. Neither one of  'em ever married. Marse Lordnorth was a good man, but he didn't have no  use for 'omans--he was a sissy. Dere warn't no Marster no whar no better  dan our Marse Alec Stephens, but he never stayed home enough to tend to  things hisself much 'cause he was all de time too busy on de outside. He  was de President or somepin of our side durin' de war.    \"Uncle Pierce went wid Marse Alec evvy whar he went. His dog, Rio, had  more sense dan most folkses. Marse Alec, he was all de time havin' big  mens visit him up at de big house. One time, out in de yard, him and one  of dem 'portant mens got in a argyment 'bout somepin. Us chillun snuck  up close to hear what dey was makin' such a rukus 'bout. I heared Marse  Alec say: 'I got more sense in my big toe dan you is got in your whole  body.' And he was right--he did have more sense dan most folkses. Ain't  I been a-tellin' you he was de President or somepin lak dat, dem days?    \"Ma, she was Marse Alec's cook and looked atter de house. Atter she died  Marse Lordnorth got Mrs. Mary Berry from Habersham County to keep house  at de big house, but Aunt 'Liza, she done de cookin' atter Miss Mary got  dar. Us little Niggers sho' did love Miss Mary. Us called her \"Mammy  Mary\" sometimes. Miss Mary had three sons and one of 'em was named Jeff  Davis. I 'members when dey come and got him and tuk him off to war.  Marse Lordnorth built a four-room house on de plantation for Miss Mary  and her boys. Evvybody loved our Miss Mary, 'cause she was so good and  sweet, and dere warn't nothin' us wouldn't have done for her.    \"No Lord! Marse Lordnorth never needed no overseer or no carriage driver  neither. Uncle Jim was de head man wat got de Niggers up evvy mornin'  and started 'em off to wuk right. De big house sho was a pretty place,  a-settin' up on a high hill. De squirrels was so tame dar dey jus'  played all 'round de yard. Marse Alec's dog is buried in dat yard.    \"No Mam, I never knowed how many acres dere was in de plantation us  lived on, and Marse Alec had other places too. He had land scattered  evvywhar. Lord, dere was a heap of Niggers on dat place, and all of us  was kin to one another. Grandma Becky and Grandpa Stafford was de fust  slaves Marse Alec ever had, and dey sho had a passel of chillun. One  thing sho Marse Lordnorth wouldn't keep no bright colored Nigger on dat  plantation if he could help it. Aunt Mary was a bright colored Nigger  and dey said dat Marse John, Marse Lordnorth's brother, was her Pa, but  anyhow Marse Lordnorth never had no use for her 'cause she was a bright  colored Nigger.    \"Marse Lordnorth never had no certain early time for his slaves to git  up nor no special late time for 'em to quit wuk. De hours dey wuked was  'cordin' to how much wuk was ahead to be done. Folks in Crawfordville  called us 'Stephens' Free Niggers.'    \"Us minded Marse Lordnorth--us had to do dat--but he let us do pretty  much as us pleased. Us never had no sorry piece of a Marster. He was a  good man and he made a sho 'nough good Marster. I never seed no Nigger  git a beatin', and what's more I never heared of nothin' lak dat on our  place. Dere was a jail in Crawfordville, but none of us Niggers on Marse  Alec's place warn't never put in it.    \"No Lord! None of us Niggers never knowed nothin' 'bout readin' and  writin'. Dere warn't no school for Niggers den, and I ain't never been  to school a day in my life. Niggers was more skeered of newspapers dan  dey is of snakes now, and us never knowed what a Bible was dem days.    \"Niggers never had no churches of deir own den. Dey went to de white  folkses' churches and sot in de gallery. One Sunday when me and my  sister Frances went to church I found 50c in Confederate money and  showed it to her. She tuk it away from me. Dat's de onliest money I seed  durin' slavery time. Course you knows dey throwed Confederate money away  for trash atter de war was over. Den us young chaps used to play wid it.    \"I never went to no baptizin's nor no funerals neither den. Funerals  warn't de style. When a Nigger died dem days, dey jus' put his body in a  box and buried it. I 'members very well when Aunt Sallie and Aunt  Catherine died, but I was little den, and I didn't take it in what dey  done bout buryin' 'em.    \"None of Marse Alec's slaves never run away to de North, 'cause he was  so good to 'em dey never wanted to leave him. De onliest Nigger what  left Marse Alec's place was Uncle Dave, and he wouldn't have left 'cept  he got in trouble wid a white 'oman. You needn't ax me her name 'cause I  ain't gwine to tell it, but I knows it well as I does my own name.  Anyhow Marse Alec give Uncle Dave some money and told him to leave, and  nobody never seed him no more atter dat.    \"Oh yessum! Us heared 'bout 'em, but none of us never seed no  patterollers on Marse Alec's plantation. He never 'lowed 'em on his  land, and he let 'em know dat he kept his slaves supplied wid passes  whenever dey wanted to go places so as dey could come and go when dey  got good and ready. Thursday and Sadday nights was de main nights dey  went off. Uncle Stafford's wife was Miss Mary Stephen's cook, Uncle  Jim's wife lived on de Finley place, and Uncle Isom's belonged to de  Hollises, so dey had regular passes all de time and no patterollers  never bothered 'em none.    \"Whenever Marse Alec or Marse Lordnorth wanted to send a message dey  jus' put George or Mack on a horse and sont 'em on but one thing sho,  dere warn't no slave knowed what was in dem letters.    \"Marse Alec sho had plenty of mules. Some of 'em was named: Pete, Clay,  Rollin, Jack, and Sal. Sal was Allen's slow mule, and he set a heap of  store by her. Dere was a heap more mules on dat place, but I can't call  back dere names right now.    \"Most times when slaves went to deir quarters at night, mens rested, but"]]]
