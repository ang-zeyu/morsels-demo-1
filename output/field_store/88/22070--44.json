One son of Hosein's, insensible from fever at the time, was spared  from the sacrifice, and, with the females and young children, taken  prisoners to the King's palace at Shawm.    The account given by historians of this awful battle, describes the  courage and intrepidity of Hosein's small band, in glowing terms of praise;  having fought singly, and by their desperate bravery 'each arm (they say)  levelled his hundreds with their kindred dust ere his own gave way to the  sway of death'.    Amongst the number of Hosein's brave defenders was a nephew, the son of  Hasan: this young man, named Cossum,[26] was the affianced husband of  Hosein's favourite daughter, Sakeena Koobraah;[27] and previous to his  going to the combat on that eventful day, Hosein read the marriage lines  between the young couple, in the tent of the females. I mention this here,  as it points to one particular part of the celebration of Mahurrum, which  I shall have occasion to mention in due order, wherein all the outward  forms of the wedding ceremony are strictly performed, annually.    During the whole of this terrible day, at Kraabaallah, the family party of  Hosein had been entirely deprived of water; and the river Fraught[28]  (Euphrates) being blockaded by their enemies, they suffered exceedingly  from thirst. The handsome Abass,[29] another nephew of Hosein, and his  standard-bearer, made many efforts to procure water for the relief of the  almost famishing females; he had, at one attempt, succeeded in filling the  mushukh,[30] when, retreating from the river, he was discovered by the  enemy, was pursued and severely wounded, the mushukh pierced by arrows,  and the water entirely lost ere he could reach the camp.    In remembrance of this privation of the sufferers at Kraabaallah, every  good Mussulmaun, at Mahurrum, distributes sherbet in abundance, to all  persons who choose to accept this their favourite beverage (sugar and  water, with a little rosewater, or kurah,[31] to flavour it); and some  charitable females expend large sums in milk, to be distributed in the  public streets; for these purposes, there are neat little huts of  sirrakee[32] (a reed, or grass, resembling bright straw) erected by the  road side of the Mussulmauns' houses; they are called saabeels,[33] where  the red earthen cups of milk, sherbet, or pure water are seen ranged in  rows, for all who choose to call for drink.    Hosein, say their historians, was the last of the party who suffered on  the day of battle; he was surrounded in his own camp--where, by the usage  of war, at that time, they had no right to enter--and when there was not  one friendly arm left to ward the blow. They relate 'that his body was  literally mangled, before he was released from his unmerited sufferings'.  He had mounted his favourite horse, which, as well as himself, was pierced  by arrows innumerable; together they sank on the earth from loss of blood,  the cowardly spearmen piercing his wounded body as if in sport; and whilst,  with his last breath, 'Hosein prayed for mercy on his destroyers,  Shimeear[34] ended his sufferings by severing the already prostrate head  from the mutilated trunk'.--'Thus they sealed (say those writers) the  lasting disgrace of a people, who, calling themselves Mussulmauns, were  the murderers of their Prophet's descendants.'    This slight sketch gives but the outline of those events which are every  year commemorated amongst the zealous followers of Ali, the class  denominated Sheahs.    The Mussulmaun people, I must here observe, are divided into two distinct  sects, viz. the Sheahs and the Soonies. The former believe Ali and his  descendants were the lawful leaders after Mahumud; the latter are  persuaded that the Caliphas, as Aboubuker, Omir, &c., were the leaders to  be accredited 'lawful'; but of this I shall speak more fully in another  Letter.    Perhaps the violence of party spirit may have acted as an inducement to  the Sheahs, for the zealous annual observance of this period, so  interesting to that sect; whatever the motive, we very often find the two  sects hoard up their private animosities and dislikes until the return of  Mahurrum, which scarcely ever passes over, in any extensively populated  city of Hindoostaun, without a serious quarrel, often terminating in  bloodshed.[35]    I could have given a more lengthened account of the events which led to  the solemnization of this fast, but I believe the present is sufficient to  explain the motives by which the Mussulmauns are actuated, and my next  Letter must be devoted to the description of the rites performed upon the  celebration of these events in India.    P.S. I have a memorandum in my collection which may here be copied as its  proper place.    From Mecca, 'The Holy City', to Medina the distance is twelve stages (a  day's march is one stage, about twenty miles of English measurement). From  Medina to Kraabaallah there are twenty-one stages; this distance is  travelled only by those who can endure great difficulties; neither water  nor provisions are to be met with on the whole journey, excepting at one  halt, the name of which is Shimmaar. From Kraabaallah to Koofah is two  stages.    In the vicinity of Koofah[36] stands Mount Judee[37] (Judea), on which is  built, over the remains of Ali, the mausoleum called Nudghiff Usheruff.[38]  On this Mount, it is said, Adam and Noah were buried. Ali being aware of  this, gave directions to his family and friends, that whenever his soul  should be recalled from earth, his mortal remains were to be deposited  near those graves venerated and held sacred 'by the faithful'. The ancient  writers of Arabia authorise the opinion that Ali's body was entombed by  the hands of his sons, Hasan and Hosein, who found the earth open to  receive their sire, and which closed immediately on his remains being  deposited.    Here, too, it is believed Noah's ark rested after the Deluge. When  pilgrims to Mecca make their zeearut[39] (all sacred visits are so called)  to this Mount, they offer three prayers, in memory of Adam, Noah, and All.    The grave of Eve is also frequently visited by pilgrims, which is said to  be situated near Jeddah; this, however, is not considered an indispensable  duty, but, as they say, prompted by 'respect for the Mother of men'.[40]    These remarks, and many others of an interesting nature, I have been  favoured with from the most venerable aged man I ever knew, Meer Hadjee  Shaah,[41] the revered father of my excellent husband; who having  performed the Hadje[42] (pilgrimage) three several times, at different  periods of his eventful life--returning after each pilgrimage to his home  in Lucknow--and being a person of strict veracity, with a remarkably  intelligent mind and retentive memory, I have profited largely by his  information, and derived from it both amusement and instruction, through  many years of social intercourse. When he had numbered more than eighty  years he dwelt with hope on again performing the Hadje, where it was his  intention to rest his earthly substance until the great day of restitution,  and often expressed his wishes to have me and mine to share with him the  pilgrimage he desired to make. But this was not allowed to his prayer; his  summons arrived rather unexpectedly to those who loved and revered him for  virtues rarely equalled; happily for him, his pure soul was prepared to  meet his Creator, in whose service he had passed this life, with all  humility, and in whose mercy alone his hopes for the future were centred.      [1] 'Whatsoever alms ye shall give, of a truth God knoweth it.... Give ye      your alms openly? it is well. Do ye conceal them and give them to the      poor? This, too, will be of advantage to you, and will do away your      sins: and God is cognizant of your actions' (_Koran_, ii. 274-5).    [2] _Sayyid_, 'lord', 'chief, the class of Musalmans who claim descent      from Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet, and 'Ali, his      cousin-german and adopted son; they are divided into two branches      descended from Hasan and Husain, sons of 'Ali and Fatimah.    [3] _Mir_, a contraction of _Amir_, 'lord'.    [4] _Koran, Qur'an_.    [5] 'They who swallow down usury shall arise in the resurrection only as      he ariseth whom Satan hath infected by his touch' (_Koran_, ii.      276). But this is rather theory than practice, and many ingenious      methods are adopted to avoid the prohibition.    [6] _Begam_, feminine of _Beg_, 'lord', used to denote a Sayyid lady, like      Khanam among Pathans.    [7] Here, as elsewhere, _zenanah, zananah_, Persian _zan_, 'woman'.    [8] This is incorrect. The Koran has been translated into various      languages, but the translation is always interlineary with the      original text. In Central Asia the Musalman conquerors allowed the      Koran to be recited in Persian, instead of Arabic, in order that it      might be intelligible to all (Arnold, _The Preaching of Islam_, 183).    [9] _Jali_.    [10] _Kurti_, a loose, long-sleeved jacket of muslin or net, among rich      women embroidered on the neck and shoulders with gold, and draped down      to the ankles in full, loose folds. It is made of red or other      light-coloured fabrics for girls and married women; dark blue, bronze,      or white for old ladies; bronze or black for widows.    [11] _Khan_, 'lord', 'prince', specially applied to persons of Mughal      or Pathan descent.    [12] _Bahadur_, 'champion', a Mongol term; see Yule,       _Hobson-Jobson_[2], 48 ff.    [13] _Nawab_, 'a deputy, delegate': the Anglo-Indian Nabob (ibid.,      610 ff.).

Second Part. C. M.  The conqueror's song.    1 To thine almighty arm we owe  The triumphs of the day  Thy terrors, Lord, confound the foe,  And melt their strength away.    2 'Tis by thine aid our troops prevail,  And break united powers,  Or burn their boasted fleets, or scale  The proudest of their towers.    3 How have we chas'd them thro' the field,  And trod them to the ground,  While thy salvation was our shield,  But they no shelter found!    4 In vain to idol-saints they cry,  And perish in their blood;  Where is a rock so great, so high,  So powerful as our God?    5 The Rock of Israel ever lives,  His name be ever blest;  'Tis his own arm the victory gives,  And gives his people rest.    6 On kings that reign as David did,  He pours his blessings down;  Secures their honours to their seed,  And well supports the crown.      Psalm 19:1. First Part. S. M.  The book of nature and scripture.    For a Lord's-day morning.    1 Behold the lofty sky  Declares its maker God,  And all his starry works on high  Proclaim his power abroad.    2 The darkness and the light  Still keep their course the same;  While night to day, and day to night  Divinely teach his name.    3 In every different land  Their general voice is known  They shew the wonders of his hand,  And orders of his throne.    4 Ye British lands, rejoice,  Here he reveals his word,  We are not left to nature's voice  To bid us know the Lord.    5 His statutes and commands  Are set before our eyes;  He puts his gospel in our hands,  Where our salvation lies.    6 His laws are just and pure,  His truth without deceit,  His promises for ever sure,  And his rewards are great.    7 [Not honey to the taste  Affords so much delight,  Nor gold that has the furnace past  So much allures the sight.    8 While of thy works I sing,  Thy glory to proclaim,  Accept the praise, my God, my King,  In my Redeemer's name.]      Psalm 19:2. Second Part. S. M.  God's word most excellent; or,  Sincerity and watchfulness.    For a Lord's-day morning.    1 Behold the morning sun  Begins his glorious way;  His beams thro' all the nations run,  And life and light convey.    2 But where the gospel comes,  It spreads diviner light,  It calls dead sinners from their tombs,  And gives the blind their sight.    3 How perfect is thy word!  And all thy judgments just!  For ever sure thy promise, Lord,  And men securely trust.    4 My gracious God, how plain  Are thy directions given!  O! may I never read in vain,  But find the path to heaven!    PAUSE.    5 I hear thy word with love,  And I would fain obey;  Send thy good Spirit from above  To guide me, lest I stray.    6 O who can ever find  The errors of his ways?  Yet, with a bold presumptuous mind,  I would not dare transgress.    7 Warn me of every sin,  Forgive my secret faults,  And cleanse this guilty soul of mine,  Whose crimes exceed my thoughts.    8 While with my heart and tongue  I spread thy praise abroad,  Accept the worship and the song,  My Saviour and my God.      Psalm 19:3. L. M.  The books of nature and of scripture compared;  or, The glory and success of the gospel.    1 The heavens declare thy glory, Lord,  In every star thy wisdom shines;  But when our eyes behold thy word  We read thy name in fairer lines.    2 The rolling sun, the changing light,  And nights and days thy power confess;  But the blest volume thou hast writ  Reveals thy justice and thy grace.    3 Sun, moon, and stars convey thy praise  Round the whole earth, and never stand;  So when thy truth begun its race,  It touch'd and glanc'd on every land.    4 Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest,  Till thro' the world thy truth has run;  Till Christ has all the nations blest,  That see the light, or feel the sun.    5 Great Sun of Righteousness, arise,  Bless the dark world with heavenly light;  Thy gospel makes the simple wise,  Thy laws are pure, thy judgments right.    6 Thy noblest wonders here we view  In souls renew'd and sins forgiven:  Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew,  And make thy word my guide to heaven.      Psalm 19:4.  To the tune of the 113th Psalm.  The book of nature and scripture.    1 Great God, the heaven's well-order'd frame  Declares the glories of thy name;  There thy rich works of wonder shine:  A thousand starry beauties there,  A thousand radiant marks appear  Of boundless power and skill divine.    2 From night to day, from day to night,  The dawning and the dying light  Lectures of heavenly wisdom read;  With silent eloquence they raise  Our thoughts to our Creator's praise,  And neither sound nor language need.    3 Yet their divine instructions run  Far as the journies of the sun,  And every nation knows their voice;  The sun, like some young bridegroom drest,  Breaks from the chambers of the east,  Rolls round, and makes the earth rejoice.    4 Where'er he spreads his beams abroad,  He smiles and speaks his maker God;  All nature joins to shew thy praise:  Thus God, in every creature shines;  Fair is the book of nature's lines,  But fairer is thy book of grace.    PAUSE.    5 I love the volumes of thy word;  What light and joy those leaves afford  To souls benighted and distrest!  Thy precepts guide my doubtful way,  Thy fear forbids my feet to stray;  Thy promise leads my heart to rest.    6 From the discoveries of thy law  The perfect rules of life I draw,  These are my study and delight:  Not honey so invites the taste,  Nor gold, that hath the furnace past,  Appears so pleasing to the sight.    7 Thy threatenings wake my slumbering eyes,  And warn me where my danger lies;  But 'tis thy blessed gospel, Lord,  That makes my guilty conscience clean,  Converts my soul, subdues my sin,  And gives a free but large reward.    8 Who knows the errors of his thoughts?  My God, forgive my secret faults,  And from presumptuous sins restrain;  Accept my poor attempts of praise  That I have read thy book of grace,  And book of nature, not in vain.      Psalm 20.  Prayer and hope of victory.  For a day of prayer in time of war.    1 Now may the God of power and grace  Attend his people's humble cry!  Jehovah hears when Israel prays,  And brings deliverance from on high.    2 The name of Jacob's God defends  Better than shields or brazen walls;  He from his sanctuary sends  Succour and strength, when Zion calls.    3 Well he remembers all our sighs,  His love exceeds our best deserts,  His love accepts the sacrifice  Of humble groans and broken hearts.    4 In his salvation is our hope,  And, in the name of Israel's God,  Our troops shall lift their banners up,  Our navies spread their flags abroad.    5 Some trust in horses train'd for war,  And some of chariots make their boast;  Our surest expectations are  From thee, the Lord of heavenly hosts.    6 [O! may the memory of thy name  Inspire our armies for the fight!  Our foes shall fall and die with shame,  Or quit the field with shameful flight.]    7 Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear;  Now let our hopes be firm and strong,  Till the salvation shall appear,  And joy and triumph raise the song.      Psalm 21:1. C. M.  Our king is the care of heaven.    1 The king, O Lord, with songs of praise,  Shall in thy strength rejoice;  And, blest with thy salvation, raise  To heaven his cheerful voice.    2 Thy sure defence, thro' nations round,  Has spread his glorious name;  And his successful actions crown'd  With majesty and fame.    3 Then let the king on God alone  For timely aid rely;  His mercy shall support the throne,  And all our wants supply.    4 But, righteous Lord, his stubborn foes  Shall feel thy dreadful hand  Thy vengeful arm shall find out those  That hate his mild command.    5 When thou against them dost engage,  Thy just but dreadful doom  Shall, like a fiery oven's rage,  Their hopes and them consume.    6 Thus, Lord, thy wondrous power declare,  And thus exalt thy fame;  Whilst we glad songs of praise prepare  For thine almighty name.      Psalm 21:2. 1-9. L. M.  Christ exalted to the kingdom.    1 David rejoic'd in God his strength,  Rais'd to the throne by special grace;  But Christ, the Son, appears at length,  Fulfils the triumph and the praise.    2 How great is the Messiah's joy  In the salvation of thy hand!  Lord, thou hast rais'd his kingdom high,  And given the world to his command.    3 Thy goodness grants whate'er he will,  Nor doth the least request withhold;  Blessings of love prevent him still,  And crowns of glory, not of gold.    4 Honour and majesty divine  Around his sacred temples shine;  Blest with the favour of thy face,  And length of everlasting days.    5 Thy hand shall find out all his foes;  And as a fiery oven glows  With raging heat and living coals,  So shall thy wrath devour their souls.      Psalm 22:1. 1-16. First Part. C. M,  The sufferings and death of Christ.    1 \"Why has my God my soul forsook,  \"Nor will a smile afford?\"  (Thus David once in anguish spoke,  And thus our dying Lord.)    2 Tho' 'tis thy chief delight to dwell  Among thy praising saints,  Yet thou canst hear a groan as well,  And pity our complaints.    3 Our fathers trusted in thy name,  And great deliverance found;  But I'm a worm, despis'd of men,  And trodden to the ground.    4 Shaking the head they pass me by,  And laugh my soul to scorn;  \"In vain he trusts in God\" they cry,  \"Neglected "]]]
