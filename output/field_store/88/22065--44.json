Don Luis bowed:    \"I thank you, Monsieur le Prefet. I hope that you will have no reason to  regret the trust which you are good enough to place in me.\"    And, taking leave of M. Desmalions and Maitre Lepertuis, he went out with  Sergeant Mazeroux.    As soon as they were outside, he told Mazeroux what he knew. The  detective seemed much impressed by his companion's professional gifts and  quite ready to be guided by his views.    They decided first to go to the Cafe du Pont-Neuf. Here they learned that  Inspector Verot, who was a regular customer of the place, had written a  long letter there that morning. And the waiter remembered that a man at  the next table, who had entered the cafe at almost the same time as the  inspector, had also asked for writing-paper and called twice for yellow  envelopes.    \"That's it,\" said Mazeroux to Don Luis. \"As you suspected, one letter has  been substituted for the other.\"    The description given by the waiter was pretty explicit: a tall man, with  a slight stoop, wearing a reddish-brown beard cut into a point, a  tortoise-shell eyeglass with a black silk ribbon, and an ebony  walking-stick with a handle shaped like a swan's head.    \"That's something for the police to go upon,\" said Mazeroux.    They were leaving the cafe when Don Luis stopped his companion.    \"One moment.\"    \"What's the matter?\"    \"We've been followed.\"    \"Followed? What next? And by whom, pray?\"    \"No one that matters. I know who it is and I may as well settle his  business and have done with it. Wait for me. I shall be back; and I'll  show you some fun. You shall see one of the 'nuts,' I promise you.\"    He returned in a minute with a tall, thin man with his face set in  whiskers. He introduced him:    \"M. Mazeroux, a friend of mine, Senor Caceres, an attache at the Peruvian  Legation. Senor Caceres took part in the interview at the Prefect's just  now. It was he who, on the Peruvian Minister's instructions, collected  the documents bearing upon my identity.\" And he added gayly: \"So you were  looking for me, dear Senor Caceres. Indeed, I expected, when we left the  police office--\"    The Peruvian attache made a sign and pointed to Sergeant Mazeroux.  Perenna replied:    \"Oh, pray don't mind M. Mazeroux! You can speak before him; he is the  soul of discretion. Besides, he knows all about the business.\"    The attache was silent. Perenna made him sit down in front of him.    \"Speak without beating about the bush, dear Senor Caceres. It's a subject  that calls for plain dealing; and I don't mind a blunt word or two. It  saves such a lot of time! Come on. You want money, I suppose? Or, rather,  more money. How much?\"    The Peruvian had a final hesitation, gave a glance at Don Luis's  companion, and then, suddenly making up his mind, said in a dull voice:    \"Fifty thousand francs!\"    \"Oh, by Jove, by Jove!\" cried Don Luis. \"You're greedy, you know! What do  you say, M. Mazeroux? Fifty thousand francs is a lot of money. Especially  as--Look here, my dear Caceres, let's go over the ground again.    \"Three years ago I had the honour of making your acquaintance in Algeria,  when you were touring the country. At the same time, I understood the  sort of man you were; and I asked you if you could manage, in three  years, with my name of Perenna, to fix me up a Spanish-Peruvian identity,  furnished with unquestionable papers and respectable ancestors. You said,  'Yes,' We settled the price: twenty thousand francs. Last week, when the  Prefect of Police asked me for my papers, I came to see you and learned  that you had just been instructed to make inquiries into my antecedents.    \"Everything was ready, as it happened. With the papers of a deceased  Peruvian nobleman, of the name of Pereira, properly revised, you had  faked me up a first-rate civic status. We arranged what you were to say  before the Prefect of Police; and I paid up the twenty thousand. We were  quits. What more do you want?\"    The Pervian attache did not betray the least embarrassment. He put his  two elbows on the table and said, very calmly:    \"Monsieur, when treating with you, three years ago, I thought I was  dealing with a gentleman who, hiding himself under the uniform of the  Foreign Legion, wished to recover the means to live respectably  afterward. To-day, I have to do with the universal legatee of Cosmo  Mornington, with a man who, to-morrow, under a false name, will receive  the sum of one million francs and, in a few months, perhaps, the sum of a  hundred millions. That's quite a different thing.\"    The argument seemed to strike Don Luis. Nevertheless, he objected:    \"And, if I refuse--?\"    \"If you refuse, I shall inform the solicitor and the Prefect of Police  that I made an error in my inquiry and that there is some mistake about  Don Luis Perenna. In consequence of which you will receive nothing at all  and very likely find yourself in jail.\"    \"With you, my worthy sir.\"    \"Me?\"    \"Of course: on a charge of forgery and tampering with registers. For you  don't imagine that I should take it lying down.\"    The attache did not reply. His nose, which was a very big one, seemed to  lengthen out still farther between his two long whiskers.    Don Luis began to laugh.    \"Come, Senor Caceres, don't pull such a face! No one's going to hurt you.  Only don't think that you can corner me. Better men than you have tried  and have broken their backs in the process. And, upon my word, you don't  cut much of a figure when you're doing your best to diddle your  fellowmen.    \"You look a bit of a mug, in fact, Caceres: a bit of a mug is what you  look. So it's understood, what? We lay down our arms. No more base  designs against our excellent friend Perenna. Capital, Senor Caceres,  capital. And now I'll be magnanimous and prove to you that the decent man  of us two is--the one whom any one would have thought!\"    He produced a check-book on the Credit Lyonnais.    \"Here, my dear chap. Here's twenty thousand francs as a present from  Cosmo Mornington's legatee. Put it in your pocket and look pleasant. Say  thank you to the kind gentleman, and make yourself scarce without turning  your head any more than if you were one of old man Lot's daughters. Off  you go: hoosh!\"    This was said in such a manner that the attache obeyed Don Luis Perenna's  injunctions to the letter. He smiled as he pocketed the check, said thank  you twice over, and made off without turning his head.    \"The low hound!\" muttered Don Luis. \"What do you say to that, Sergeant?\"    Sergeant Mazeroux was looking at him in stupefaction, with his eyes  starting from his head.    \"Well, but, Monsieur--\"    \"What, Sergeant?\"    \"Well, but, Monsieur, who are you?\"    \"Who am I?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Didn't they tell you? A Peruvian nobleman, or a Spanish nobleman, I  don't know which. In short, Don Luis Perenna.\"    \"Bunkum! I've just heard--\"    \"Don Luis Perenna, late of the Foreign Legion.\"    \"Enough of that, Monsieur--\"    \"Medaled and decorated with a stripe on every seam.\"    \"Once more, Monsieur, enough of that; and come along with me to  the Prefect.\"    \"But, let me finish, hang it! I was saying, late private in the Foreign  Legion.... Late hero.... Late prisoner of the Surete.... Late Russian  prince.... Late chief of the detective service.... Late--\"    \"But you're mad!\" snarled the sergeant. \"What's all this story?\"    \"It's a true story, Sergeant, and quite genuine. You ask me who I am; and  I'm telling you categorically. Must I go farther back? I have still more  titles to offer you: marquis, baron, duke, archduke, grand-duke,  petty-duke, superduke--the whole 'Almanach de Gotha,' by Jingo! If any  one told me that I had been a king, by all that's holy, I shouldn't dare  swear to the contrary!\"    Sergeant Mazeroux put out his own hands, accustomed to rough work, seized  the seemingly frail wrists of the man addressing him and said:    \"No nonsense, now. I don't know whom I've got hold of, but I shan't let  you go. You can say what you have to say at the Prefect's.\"    \"Don't speak so loud, Alexandre.\"    The two frail wrists were released with unparalleled ease; the sergeant's  powerful hands were caught and rendered useless; and Don Luis grinned:    \"Don't you know me, you idiot?\"    Sergeant Mazeroux did not utter a word. His eyes started still farther  from his head. He tried to understand and remained absolutely dumfounded.    The sound of that voice, that way of jesting, that schoolboy playfulness  allied with that audacity, the quizzing expression of those eyes, and  lastly that Christian name of Alexandre, which was not his name at all  and which only one person used to give him, years ago. Was it possible?    \"The chief!\" he stammered. \"The chief!\"    \"Why not?\"    \"No, no, because--\"    \"Because what?\"    \"Because you're dead.\"    \"Well, what about it? D'you think it interferes with my living,  being dead?\"    And, as the other seemed more and more perplexed, he laid his hand on his  shoulder and said:    \"Who put you into the police office?\"    \"The Chief Detective, M. Lenormand.\"    \"And who was M. Lenormand?\"    \"The chief.\"    \"You mean Arsene Lupin, don't you?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, Alexandre, don't you know that it was much more difficult for  Arsene Lupin to be Chief Detective--and a masterly Chief Detective he  was--than to be Don Luis Perenna, to be decorated in the Foreign Legion,  to be a hero, and even to be alive after he was dead?\"    Sergeant Mazeroux examined his companion in silence. Then his lacklustre  eyes brightened, his drab features turned scarlet and, suddenly striking  the table with his fist, he growled, in an angry voice:    \"All right, very well! But I warn you that you mustn't reckon on me. No,  not that!

I have once more had some blissful moments during  the last two years, and it is the first time I ever felt that marriage  could make me happy. Unluckily, she is not in my rank of life, and indeed  at this moment I can marry no one; I must first bestir myself actively in  the world. Had it not been for my deafness, I would have travelled half  round the globe ere now, and this I must still do. For me there is no  pleasure so great as to promote and to pursue my art.    Do not suppose that I could be happy with you. What indeed could make me  happier? Your very solicitude would distress me; I should read your  compassion every moment in your countenance, which would make me only still  more unhappy. What were my thoughts amid the glorious scenery of my  father-land? The hope alone of a happier future, which would have been mine  but for this affliction! Oh! I could span the world were I only free from  this! I feel that my youth is only now commencing. Have I not always been  an infirm creature? For some time past my bodily strength has been  increasing, and it is the same with my mental powers. I feel, though I  cannot describe it, that I daily approach the object I have in view, in  which alone can your Beethoven live. No rest for him!--I know of none but  in sleep, and I do grudge being obliged to sacrifice more time to it than  formerly.[1] Were I only half cured of my malady, then I would come to you,  and, as a more perfect and mature man, renew our old friendship.    You should then see me as happy as I am ever destined to be here below--not  unhappy. No! that I could not endure; I will boldly meet my fate, never  shall it succeed in crushing me. Oh! it is so glorious to live one's life a  thousand times over! I feel that I am no longer made for a quiet existence.  You will write to me as soon as possible? Pray try to prevail on Steffen  [von Breuning] to seek an appointment from the Teutonic Order somewhere.  Life here is too harassing for his health; besides, he is so isolated that  I do not see how he is ever to get on. You know the kind of existence here.  I do not take it upon myself to say that society would dispel his  lassitude, but he cannot be persuaded to go anywhere. A short time since, I  had some music in my house, but our friend Steffen stayed away. Do  recommend him to be more calm and self-possessed, which I have in vain  tried to effect; otherwise he can neither enjoy health nor happiness. Tell  me in your next letter whether you care about my sending you a large  selection of music; you can indeed dispose of what you do not want, and  thus repay the expense of the carriage, and have my portrait into the  bargain. Say all that is kind and amiable from me to Lorchen, and also to  mamma and Christoph. You still have some regard for me? Always rely on the  love as well as the friendship of your    BEETHOVEN.

TO KAPELLMEISTER HOFMEISTER,--LEIPZIG.[1]    Vienna, Dec. 15, 1800.    MY DEAR BROTHER IN ART,--    I have often intended to answer your proposals, but am frightfully lazy  about all correspondence; so it is usually a good while before I can make  up my mind to write dry letters instead of music. I have, however, at last  forced myself to answer your application. _Pro primo_, I must tell you how  much I regret that you, my much-loved brother in the science of music, did  not give me some hint, so that I might have offered you my quartets, as  well as many other things that I have now disposed of. But if you are as  conscientious, my dear brother, as many other publishers, who grind to  death us poor composers, you will know pretty well how to derive ample  profit when the works appear. I now briefly state what you can have from  me. 1st. A Septet, _per il violino, viola, violoncello, contra-basso,  clarinetto, corno, fagotto;--tutti obbligati_ (I can write nothing that is  not _obbligato_, having come into the world with an _obbligato_  accompaniment!) This Septet pleases very much. For more general use it  might be arranged for one more _violino, viola_, and _violoncello_, instead  of the three wind-instruments, _fagotto, clarinetto_, and _corno_.[2] 2d. A  Grand Symphony with full orchestra [the 1st]. 3rd. A pianoforte Concerto  [Op. 19], which I by no means assert to be one of my best, any more than  the one Mollo is to publish here [Op. 15], (this is for the benefit of the  Leipzig critics!) because _I reserve the best for myself_ till I set off on  my travels; still the work will not disgrace you to publish. 4th. A Grand  Solo Sonata [Op. 22]. These are all I can part with at this moment; a  little later you can have a quintet for stringed instruments, and probably  some quartets also, and other pieces that I have not at present beside me.  In your answer you can yourself fix the prices; and as you are neither an  _Italian_ nor a _Jew_, nor am I either, we shall no doubt quickly agree.  Farewell, and rest assured,    My dear brother in art, of the esteem of your    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The letters to Hofmeister, formerly of Vienna, who conducted  the correspondence with Beethoven in the name of the firm of \"Hofmeister &  Kuehnel, Bureau de Musique,\" are given here as they first appeared in 1837  in the _Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_. On applying to the present  representative of that firm, I was told that those who now possess these  letters decline giving them out of their own hands, and that no copyist can  be found able to decipher or transcribe them correctly.]    [Footnote 2: This last phrase is not in the copy before me, but in Marx's  _Biography_, who appears to have seen the original.]      20.    TO KAPELLMEISTER HOFMEISTER.    Vienna, Jan. 15 (or thereabouts), 1801.    I read your letter, dear brother and friend, with much pleasure, and I  thank you for your good opinion of me and of my works, and hope I may  continue to deserve it. I also beg you to present all due thanks to Herr K.  [Kuehnel] for his politeness and friendship towards me. I, on my part,  rejoice in your undertakings, and am glad that when works of art do turn  out profitable, they fall to the share of true artists, rather than to that  of mere tradesmen.    Your intention to publish Sebastian Bach's works really gladdens my heart,  which beats with devotion for the lofty and grand productions of this our  father of the science of harmony, and I trust I shall soon see them appear.  I hope when golden peace is proclaimed, and your subscription list opened,  to procure you many subscribers here.[1]    With regard to our own transactions, as you wish to know my proposals, they  are as follows. I offer you at present the following works:--The Septet  (which I already wrote to you about), 20 ducats; Symphony, 20 ducats;  Concerto, 10 ducats; Grand Solo Sonata, _allegro, adagio, minuetto, rondo_,  20 ducats. This Sonata [Op. 22] is well up to the mark, my dear brother!    Now for explanations. You may perhaps be surprised that I make no  difference of price between the sonata, septet, and symphony. I do so  because I find that a septet or a symphony has not so great a sale as a  sonata, though a symphony ought unquestionably to be of the most value.  (N.B. The septet consists of a short introductory _adagio_, an _allegro,  adagio, minuetto, andante_, with variations, _minuetto_, and another short  _adagio_ preceding a _presto_.) I only ask ten ducats for the concerto,  for, as I already wrote to you, I do not consider it one of my best. I  cannot think that, taken as a whole, you will consider these prices  exorbitant; at least, I have endeavored to make them as moderate as  possible for you.    With regard to the banker's draft, as you give me my choice, I beg you will  make it payable by Germueller or Schueller. The entire sum for the four works  will amount to 70 ducats; I understand no currency but Vienna ducats, so  how many dollars in gold they make in your money is no affair of mine, for  really I am a very bad man of business and accountant. Now this  _troublesome_ business is concluded;--I call it so, heartily wishing that  it could be otherwise here below! There ought to be only one grand _depot_  of art in the world, to which the artist might repair with his works, and  on presenting them receive what he required; but as it now is, one must be  half a tradesman besides--and how is this to be endured? Good heavens! I  may well call it _troublesome_!    As for the Leipzig oxen,[2] let them talk!--they certainly will make no man  immortal by their prating, and as little can they deprive of immortality  those whom Apollo destines to attain it.    Now may Heaven preserve you and your colleagues! I have been unwell for  some time; so it is rather difficult for me at present to write even music,  much more letters. I trust we shall have frequent opportunities to assure  each other how truly you are my friend, and I yours.    I hope for a speedy answer. Adieu!    L. V. BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: I have at this moment in my hands this edition of Bach, bound  in one thick volume, together with the first part of Naegeli's edition of  the _Wohltemperirtes Clavier_, also three books of exercises (D, G, and C  minor), the _Toccata in D Minor_, and _Twice Fifteen Inventions_.]    [Footnote 2: It is thus that Schindler supplies the gap. It is probably an  allusion to the _Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung_, founded about three  years previously.]      21.    TO HERR HOFMEISTER.    Vienna, April 22, 1801.    You have indeed too good cause to complain not a little of me. My excuse is  that I have been ill, and in addition had so much to do, that I could  scarcely even think of what I was to send you. Moreover, the only thing in  me that resembles a genius is, that my papers are never in very good order,  and yet no one but"]]]
