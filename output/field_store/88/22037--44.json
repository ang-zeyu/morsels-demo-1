And shall I here forget the scene,      Still nearest to my breast?    Rocks rise, and rivers roll between      The spot which passion blest;    Yet, Mary,[6] all thy beauties seem    Fresh as in Love's bewitching dream,      To me in smiles display'd:    Till slow disease resigns his prey    To Death, the parent of decay,      Thine image cannot fade.      And thou, my friend![7] whose gentle love      Yet thrills my bosom's chords,    How much thy friendship was above      Description's power of words!    Still near my breast thy gift I wear,    Which sparkled once with feeling's tear.      Of Love, the pure, the sacred gem;    Our souls were equal, and our lot    In that dear moment quite forgot;      Let Pride alone condemn!      All, all is dark and cheerless now!      No smile of Love's deceit    Can warm my veins with wonted glow,      Can bid Life's pulses beat:    Not e'en the hope of future fame    Can wake my faint, exhausted frame.      Or crown with fancied wreaths my head.    Mine is a short inglorious race,    To humble in the dust my face,      And mingle with the dead.      Oh Fame! thou goddess of my heart:      On him who gains thy praise,    Pointless must fall the Spectre's dart,      Consumed in glory's blaze;    But me she beckons from the earth,    My name obscure, unmark'd my birth,      My life a short and vulgar dream:    Lost in the dull, ignoble crowd,    My hopes recline within a shroud,      My fate is Lethe's stream.      When I repose beneath the sod,      Unheeded in the clay,    Where once my playful footsteps trod,      Where now my head must lay;    The meed of pity will be shed    In dew-drops o'er my narrow bed,      By nightly skies and storms alone;    No mortal eye will deign to steep    With tears the dark sepulchral deep      Which hides a name unknown.      Forget this world, my restless sprite,      Turn, turn thy thoughts to Heaven;    There must thou soon direct thy flight,      If errors are forgiven,    To bigots and to sects unknown,    Bow down beneath the Almighty's Throne;      To Him address thy trembling prayer:    He who is merciful and just,    Will not reject a child of dust,      Although his meanest care.      Father of Light! to Thee I call,      My soul is dark within;    Thou, who canst mark the sparrow's fall,      Avert the death of sin.    Thou, who canst guide the wandering star,    Who calms't the elemental war,      Whose mantle is yon boundless sky,    My thoughts, my words, my crimes forgive;    And, since I soon must cease to live,      Instruct me how to die.    1807.

Thou power! who hast ruled me through infancy's days,      Young offspring of Fancy, 'tis time we should part,    Then rise on the gale this the last of my lays,      The coldest effusion which springs from my heart.      This bosom, responsive to rapture no more,      Shall hush thy wild notes, nor implore thee to sing;    The feelings of childhood, which taught thee to soar,      Are wafted far distant on Apathy's wing.      Though simple the themes of my rude flowing lyre,      Yet even these themes are departed for ever;    No more beam the eyes which my dream could inspire,      My visions are flown, to return--alas, never!      When drain'd is the nectar which gladdens the bowl,      How vain is the effort delight to prolong!    When cold is the beauty which dwelt in my soul,      What magic of Fancy can lengthen my song?      Can the lips sing of Love in the desert alone,      Of kisses and smiles which they now must resign?    Or dwell with delight on the hours that are flown?      Ah, no! for those hours can no longer be mine.      Can they speak of the friends that I lived but to love?      Ah, surely affection ennobles the strain!    But how can my numbers in sympathy move,      When I scarcely can hope to behold them again?      Can I sing of the deeds which my Fathers have done,      And raise my loud harp to the fame of my sires?    For glories like theirs, oh, how faint is my tone!      For Heroes' exploits how unequal my fires!      Untouch'd, then, my lyre shall reply to the blast;      'Tis hush'd; and my feeble endeavours are o'er;    And those who have heard it will pardon the past,      When they know that its murmurs shall vibrate no more.      And soon shall its wild erring notes be forgot,      Since early affection and love is o'ercast:    Oh! blest had my fate been, and happy my lot,      Had the first strain of love been the dearest, the last.      Farewell, my young Muse! since we now can ne'er meet;      If our songs have been languid, they surely are few:    Let us hope that the present at least will be sweet;      The present--which seals our eternal Adieu.    1807. [Now first published.]           *       *       *       *       *        RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS    FUNERAL OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.      The death of William, almost every reader knows, was occasioned by a hurt  in the belly from the pummel of his saddle, while reducing the town of  Mantes to ashes, at Rouen on Sep. 9, 1086, in the 63rd year of his age and  21st of his reign.    The king's decease was the signal for general consternation throughout the  metropolis of Normandy. The citizens, panic struck, ran to and fro as if  intoxicated, or as if the town were upon the point of being taken by  assault. Each asked counsel of his neighbour, and each anxiously turned  his thoughts to the concealing of his property. When the alarm had in some  measure subsided, the monks and clergy made a solemn procession to the  abbey of St. George, where they offered their prayers for the repose of  the soul of the departed duke: and Archbishop William commanded that the  body should be carried to Caen, to be interred in the church of St.  Stephen, which William had founded. But the lifeless king was now deserted  by all who had participated in his bounty. Every one of his brethren and  relations had left him; nor was there even a servant to be found to  perform the last offices to his departed lord. The care of the obsequies  was finally undertaken by Herluin, a knight of that district, who, moved  by the love of God and the honour of his nation, provided at his own  expense, embalmers and bearers, and a hearse, and conveyed the corpse to  the Seine, whence it was carried by land and water to the place of its  destination.    Upon the arrival of the funeral train at Caen, it was met by Gislebert,  bishop of Evreux, then abbot of St. Stephen's, at the head of his monks,  attended by a numerous throng of clergy and laity; but scarcely had the  bier been brought within the gates, when the report was spread that a  dreadful fire had broken out in another part of the town, and the duke's  remains were a second time deserted. The monks alone remained; and,  fearful and resolute, they bore their founder \"with candle, with book, and  with knell,\" to his last home. Ordericus Vitalis enumerates the principal  prelates and barons assembled upon this occasion; but he makes no mention  of the Conqueror's son Henry, who, according to William of Jumieges, was  the only one worthy of succeeding such a father. Mass had now been  performed, and the body was about to be committed to the ground, \"ashes to  ashes, dust to dust,\" when, previously to this closing part of the  ceremony, Gislebert mounted the pulpit, and delivered an ovation in honour  of the deceased. He praised his valour, which had so widely extended the  limits of the Norman dominion; his ability, which had elevated the nation  to the highest pitch of glory; his equity in the administration of justice;  his firmness in correcting abuses; and his liberality towards the monks  and clergy; then finally addressing the people, he besought them to  intercede with the Almighty for the soul of their prince. At this moment,  one Asselin, an obscure individual, starting from the crowd, exclaimed  with a loud voice, \"the ground upon which you are standing was the site of  my father's dwelling. This man, for whom you ask our prayers, took it by  force from my parent; by violence he seized, by violence he retained it;  and, contrary to all law and justice, he built upon it this church,  wherein we are assembled. Publicly, therefore, in the sight of God and man,  do I claim my inheritance, and protest against the body of the plunderer  being covered with my turf.\" The appeal was attended with instant effect:  bishops and nobles united in their entreaties with Asselin; they admitted  the justice of his claim; they pacified him; they paid him sixty shillings  on the spot by way of recompense for the place of sepulture; and, finally,  they satisfied him for the rest of the land.    But the remarkable incidents doomed to attend upon this burial were not  yet at an end; for at the time when they were laying the corpse in the  sarcophagus, and were bending it with some force, which they were  compelled to do, in consequence of the coffin having been made too short,  the body, which was extremely corpulent, burst, and so intolerable a  stench issued from the grave, that all the perfumes which arose from all  the censers of the priests and acolytes were of no avail; and the rites  were concluded in haste, and the assembly, struck with horror, returned to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#7)"],[1,", my lord, how little is known of  what is going on by people of that sort; I am of Monsieur de  Bassompierre's party. Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France?\"    \"He is dead, sir; a great loss. His devotion to the queen was boundless;  men of loyalty are scarce.\"    \"I think so, forsooth,\" said Rochefort, \"and when you find any of them,  you march them off to the Bastile. However, there are plenty in the  world, but you don't look in the right direction for them, my lord.\"    \"Indeed! explain to me. Ah! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, how much you  must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal! Ah! he  was a great man.\"    \"Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson?\"    \"I! never! you know you may say anything to me. I try to be beloved, not  feared.\"    \"Well, there is on the wall of my cell, scratched with a nail, a  proverb, which says, 'Like master, like servant.'\"    \"Pray, what does that mean?\"    \"It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants,  dozens and dozens of them.\"    \"He! the point aimed at by every poniard! Richelieu, who passed his life  in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him!\"    \"But he did ward them off,\" said De Rochefort, \"and the reason was, that  though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends. I have  known persons,\" he continued--for he thought he might avail himself of  the opportunity of speaking of D'Artagnan--\"who by their sagacity and  address have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu; who by  their valor have got the better of his guards and spies; persons without  money, without support, without credit, yet who have preserved to the  crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon.\"    \"But those men you speak of,\" said Mazarin, smiling inwardly on seeing  Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him, \"those men  were not devoted to the cardinal, for they contended against him.\"    \"No; in that case they would have met with more fitting reward. They had  the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you  were seeking servants.\"    \"But how is it that you know so much of these matters?\"    \"I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my  enemies; because they fought against me; because I did them all the harm  I could and they returned it to the best of their ability; because one  of them, with whom I had most to do, gave me a pretty sword-thrust, now  about seven years ago, the third that I received from the same hand; it  closed an old account.\"    \"Ah!\" said Mazarin, with admirable suavity, \"could I but find such men!\"    \"My lord, there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as  I describe, and during those six years he has been unappreciated and  unemployed by you.\"    \"Who is it?\"    \"It is Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"    \"That Gascon!\" cried Mazarin, with well acted surprise.    \"'That Gascon' has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess  that in point of talent, address and political skill, to him he was only  a tyro.\"    \"Really?\"    \"It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excellency.\"    \"Tell me a little about it, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort.\"    \"That is somewhat difficult, my lord,\" said Rochefort, with a smile.    \"Then he will tell it me himself.\"    \"I doubt it, my lord.\"    \"Why do you doubt it?\"    \"Because the secret does not belong to him; because, as I have told you,  it has to do with a great queen.\"    \"And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that?\"    \"No, my lord, he had three colleagues, three brave men, men such as you  were wishing for just now.\"    \"And were these four men attached to each other, true in heart, really  united?\"    \"As if they had been one man--as if their four hearts had pulsated in  one breast.\"    \"You pique my curiosity, dear Rochefort; pray tell me the whole story.\"    \"That is impossible; but I will tell you a true story, my lord.\"    \"Pray do so, I delight in stories,\" cried the cardinal.    \"Listen, then,\" returned Rochefort, as he spoke endeavoring to read in  that subtle countenance the cardinal's motive. \"Once upon a time there  lived a queen--a powerful monarch--who reigned over one of the greatest  kingdoms of the universe; and a minister; and this minister wished much  to injure the queen, whom once he had loved too well. (Do not try, my  lord, you cannot guess who it is; all this happened long before you came  into the country where this queen reigned.) There came to the court an  ambassador so brave, so magnificent, so elegant, that every woman lost  her heart to him; and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him  certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like  them.    \"As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his  majesty to insist upon the queen's appearing in them as part of her  jewels at a ball which was soon to take place. There is no occasion to  tell you, my lord, that the minister knew for a fact that these  ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador, who was far away, beyond  seas. This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her  subjects--fallen from her high estate.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Well, my lord, four men resolved to save her. These four men were not  princes, neither were they dukes, neither were they men in power; they  were not even rich. They were four honest soldiers, each with a good  heart, a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it.  They set out. The minister knew of their departure and had planted  people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination.  Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants; one  of them alone arrived at the port, having either killed or wounded those  who wished to stop him. He crossed the sea and brought back the set of  ornaments to the great queen, who was able to wear them on her shoulder  on the appointed day; and this very nearly ruined the minister. What do  you think of that exploit, my lord?\"    \"It is magnificent!\" said Mazarin, thoughtfully.    \"Well, I know of ten such men.\"    Mazarin made no reply; he reflected.    Five or six minutes elapsed.    \"You have nothing more to ask of me, my lord?\" said Rochefort.    \"Yes. And you say that Monsieur d'Artagnan was one of those four men?\"    \"He led the enterprise.\"    \"And who were the others?\"    \"I leave it to Monsieur d'Artagnan to name them, my lord. They were his  friends and not mine. He alone would have any influence with them; I do  not even know them under their true names.\"    \"You suspect me, Monsieur de Rochefort; I want him and you and all to  aid me.\"    \"Begin with me, my lord; for after five or six years of imprisonment it  is natural to feel some curiosity as to one's destination.\"    \"You, my dear Monsieur de Rochefort, shall have the post of confidence;  you shall go to Vincennes, where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined; you  will guard him well for me. Well, what is the matter?\"    \"The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible,\" said  Rochefort, shaking his head with an air of disappointment.    \"What! impossible? And why is it impossible?\"    \"Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends, or rather, I am one  of his. Have you forgotten, my lord, that it is he who answered for me  to the queen?\"    \"Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State.\"    \"That may be, my lord; but since I am neither king nor queen nor  minister, he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your offer.\"    \"This, then, is what you call devotion! I congratulate you. Your  devotion does not commit you too far, Monsieur de Rochefort.\"    \"And then, my lord,\" continued Rochefort, \"you understand that to emerge  from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change one's  prison.\"    \"Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort; that will  be the most sincere line of conduct,\" said Mazarin.    \"My lord, I have been so long shut up, that I am only of one party--I am  for fresh air. Employ me in any other way; employ me even actively, but  let it be on the high roads.\"    \"My dear Monsieur de Rochefort,\" Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery,  \"you think yourself still a young man; your spirit is that of the  phoenix, but your strength fails you. Believe me, you ought now to take  a rest. Here!\"    \"You decide, then, nothing about me, my lord?\"    \"On the contrary, I have come to a decision.\"    Bernouin came into the room.    \"Call an officer of justice,\" he said; \"and stay close to me,\" he added,  in a low tone.    The officer entered. Mazarin wrote a few words, which he gave to this  man; then he bowed.    \"Adieu, Monsieur de Rochefort,\" he said.    Rochefort bent low.    \"I see, my lord, I am to be taken back to the Bastile.\"    \"You are sagacious.\"    \"I shall return thither, my lord, but it is a mistake on your part not  to employ me.\"    \"You? the friend of my greatest foes? Don't suppose that you are the  only person who can serve me, Monsieur de Rochefort. I shall find many  men as able as you are.\"    \"I wish you may, my lord,\" replied De Rochefort.    He was then reconducted by the little staircase, instead of passing  through the ante-chamber where D'Artagnan was waiting. In the courtyard  the carriage and the four musketeers were ready, but he looked around in  vain for his friend.    \"Ah!\" he muttered to himself, \"this changes the situation, and if there  is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin  that we are still, thank God, good for something else than keeping guard  over a prisoner;\" and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a  man of five-and-twenty.          4. Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty-six.      When left alone with Bernouin, Mazarin was for some minutes lost in  thought. He had gained much information, but not enough. Mazarin was a  cheat at the card-table. This is a detail preserved"]]]
