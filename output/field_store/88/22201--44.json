Before setting out on our journey towards the Himalaya we formed once  more an agreeable party to visit the Marble Rocks of the Nerbudda at  Bheraghat.[1] It was the end of Kartik,[2] when the Hindoos hold  fairs on all their sacred streams at places consecrated by poetry or  tradition as the scene of some divine work or manifestation. These  fairs are at once festive and holy; every person who comes enjoying  himself as much as he can, and at the same time seeking purification  from all past transgressions by bathing and praying in the holy  stream, and making laudable resolutions to be better for the future.  The ceremonies last five days, and take place at the same time upon  all the sacred rivers throughout India; and the greater part of the  whole Hindoo population, from the summits of the Himalaya mountains  to Cape Comorin, will, I believe, during these five days, be found  congregated at these fairs. In sailing down the Ganges one may pass  in the course of a day half a dozen such fairs, each with a multitude  equal to the population of a large city, and rendered beautifully  picturesque by the magnificence and variety of the tent equipages of  the great and wealthy. The preserver of the universe (_Bhagvan_)  Vishnu is supposed, on the 26th of Asarh, to descend to the world  below (_Patal_) to defend Raja Bali from the attacks of Indra, to  stay with him four months, and to come up again on the 26th  Kartik.[3] During his absence almost all kinds of worship and  festivities are suspended; and they recommence at these fairs, where  people assemble to hail his resurrection.    Our tents were pitched upon a green sward on one bank of a small  stream running into the Nerbudda close by, while the multitude  occupied the other bank. At night all the tents and booths are  illuminated, and the scene is hardly less animated by night than by  day; but what strikes a European most is the entire absence of all  tumult and disorder at such places. He not only sees no disturbance,  but feels assured that there will be none; and leaves his wife and  children in the midst of a crowd of a hundred thousand persons all  strangers to them, and all speaking a language and following a  religion different from theirs, while he goes off the whole day,  hunting and shooting in the distant jungles, without the slightest  feeling of apprehension for their safety or comfort. It is a singular  fact, which I know to be true, that during the great mutiny of our  native troops at Barrackpore in 1824, the chief leaders bound  themselves by a solemn oath not to suffer any European lady or child  to be injured or molested, happen what might to them in the collision  with their officers and the Government. My friend Captain Reid, one  of the general staff, used to allow his children, five in number, to  go into the lines and play with the soldiers of the mutinous  regiments up to the very day when the artillery opened upon them;  and, of above thirty European ladies then at the station, not one  thought of leaving the place till they heard the guns.[4] Mrs.  Colonel Faithful, with her daughter and another young lady, who had  both just arrived from England, went lately all the way from Calcutta  to Ludiana on the banks of the Hyphasis, a distance of more than  twelve hundred miles, in their palankeens with relays of bearers, and  without even a servant to attend them.[5] They were travelling night  and day for fourteen days without the slightest apprehension of  injury or of insult. Cases of ladies travelling in the same manner by  _dak_ (stages) immediately after their arrival from England to all  parts of the country occur every day, and I know of no instance of  injury or insult sustained by them.[6] Does not this speak volumes  for the character of our rule in India? Would men trust their wives  and daughters in this manner unprotected among a people that disliked  them and their rule? We have not a garrison, or walled cantonments,  or fortified position of any kind for our residence from one end of  our Eastern empire to the other, save at the three capitals of  Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay.[7] We know and feel that the people  everywhere look up to and respect us, in spite of all our faults, and  we like to let them know and feel that we have confidence in them.    Sir Thomas Munro has justly observed, 'I do not exactly know what is  meant by civilizing the people of India. In the theory and practice  of good government they may be deficient; but, if a good system of  agriculture, if unrivalled manufactures, if the establishment of  schools for reading and writing, if the general practice of kindness  and hospitality, and, above all, if a scrupulous respect and delicacy  towards the female sex are amongst the points that denote a civilized  people; then the Hindoos are not inferior in civilization to the  people of Europe'.[8]    Bishop Heber writes in the same favourable terms of the Hindoos in  the narrative of his journey through India; and where shall we find a  mind more capable of judging of the merits and demerits of a people  than his?[9]    The concourse of people at this fair was, as usual, immense; but a  great many who could not afford to provide tents for the  accommodation of their families were driven away before their time by  some heavy showers of, to them, unseasonable rains. On this and  similar occasions the people bathe in the Nerbudda without the aid of  priests, but a number of poor Brahmans attend at these festivals to  receive charity, though not to assist at the ceremonies. Those who  could afford it gave a trifle to these men as they came out of the  sacred stream, but in no case was it demanded, or even solicited with  any appearance of importunity, as it commonly is at fairs and holy  places on the Ganges. The first day, the people bathe below the rapid  over which the river falls after it emerges from its peaceful abode  among the marble rocks; on the second day, just above this rapid; and  on the third day, two miles further up at the cascade, when the whole  body of the limpid stream of the Nerbudda, confined to a narrow  channel of only a few yards wide, falls tumultuously down in a  beautiful cascade into a deep chasm of marble rocks. This fall of  their sacred stream the people call the 'Dhuandhar', or 'the smoky  fall', from the thick vapour which is always seen rising from it in  the morning. From below, the river glides quietly and imperceptibly  for a mile and a half along a deep, and, according to popular belief,  a fathomless channel of from ten to fifty yards wide, with snow-white  marble rocks rising perpendicularly on either side from a hundred to  a hundred and fifty feet high, and in some parts fearfully  overhanging. Suspended in recesses of these white rocks are numerous  large black nests of hornets ready to descend upon any unlucky wight  who may venture to disturb their repose;[10] and, as the boats of the  curious European visitors pass up and down to the sound of music,  clouds of wild pigeons rise from each side, and seem sometimes to  fill the air above them. Here, according to native legends, repose  the Pandavas, the heroes of their great Homeric poem, the  Mahabharata, whose names they have transferred to the valley of the  Nerbudda. Every fantastic appearance of the rocks, caused by those  great convulsions of nature which have so much disturbed the crust of  the globe, or by the slow and silent working of the, waters, is  attributed to the god-like power of those great heroes of Indian  romance, and is associated with the recollection of scenes in which  they are supposed to have figured.[11]    The strata of the Kaimur range of sandstone hills, which runs  diagonally across the valley of the Nerbudda, are thrown up almost  perpendicularly, in some places many hundred feet above the level of  the plain, while in others for many miles together their tops are  only visible above the surface. These are so many strings of the oxen  which the arrows of Arjun, one of the five brothers, converted into  stone; and many a stream which now waters the valley first sprang  from the surface of the earth at the touch of his lance, as his  troops wanted water. The image of the gods of a former day, which now  lie scattered among the ruins of old cities, buried in the depth of  the forest, are nothing less than the bodies of the kings of the  earth turned into stone for their temerity in contending with these  demigods in battle. Ponds among the rocks of the Nerbudda, where all  the great fairs are held, still bear the names of the five brothers,  who are the heroes of this great poem;[12] and they are every year  visited by hundreds of thousands who implicitly believe that their  waters once received upon their bosoms the wearied limbs of those  whose names they bear. What is life without the charms of fiction,  and without the leisure and recreations which these sacred imaginings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],[0,"Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#7)"],[1,"not being very well, and the Contents of the Chapter and  Sympathy with her draw Tears from me also.\"    A writer of our own day, Alice Morse Earle, has well expressed our  opinion when she says in her _Child Life in Colonial Days_: \"The  terrible verses telling of God's judgment on the land, of fear of the  pit, of the snare, of emptiness and waste, of destruction and  desolation, must have sunk deep into the heart of the sick child, and  produced the condition shown by this entry when she was a few years  older: 'When I came in, past 7 at night, my wife met me in the Entry and  told me Betty had surprised them. I was surprised with the Abruptness of  the Relation. It seems Betty Sewall had given some signs of dejection  and sorrow; but a little while after dinner she burst into an amazing  cry which caus'd all the family to cry too. Her mother ask'd the Reason,  she gave none; at last said she was afraid she should go to Hell, her  Sins were not pardon'd. She was first wounded by my reading a Sermon of  Mr. Norton's; Text, Ye shall seek me and shall not find me. And these  words in the Sermon, Ye shall seek me and die in your Sins, ran in her  Mind and terrified her greatly. And staying at home, she read out of Mr.  Cotton Mather--Why hath Satan filled thy Heart? which increas'd her  Fear. Her Mother asked her whether she pray'd. She answered Yes, but  fear'd her prayers were not heard, because her sins were not  pardoned.'\"[11]    We may well imagine the anguish of Betty Sewall's mother. And yet  neither that mother, whose life had been gloomy enough under the same  religion, nor the father who had led his child into distress by holding  before her her sinful condition, could offer any genuine comfort. Miss  Earle has summarized with briefness and force the results of such  training: \"A frightened child, a retiring girl, a vacillating  sweetheart, an unwilling bride, she became the mother of eight children;  but always suffered from morbid introspection, and overwhelming fear of  death and the future life, until at the age of thirty-five her father  sadly wrote, 'God has delivered her now from all her fears.'\"[12]    According to our modern conception of what child life should consist of,  the existence of the Puritan girl must have been darkened from early  infancy by such a creed. Only the indomitable desire of the human being  to survive, and the capacity of the human spirit under the pressure of  daily duties to thrust back into the subconscious mind its dread or  terror, could enable man or woman to withstand the physical and mental  strain of the theories hurled down so sternly and so confidently from  the colonial pulpit. Cotton Mather in his _Diary_ records this incident  when his daughter was but four years old: \"I took my little daughter  Katy into my Study and then I told my child I am to dye Shortly and she  must, when I am Dead, remember Everything I now said unto her. I sett  before her the sinful Condition of her Nature, and I charged her to pray  in Secret Places every Day. That God for the sake of Jesus Christ would  give her a New Heart. I gave her to understand that when I am taken from  her she must look to meet with more humbling Afflictions than she does  now she has a Tender Father to provide for her.\"    Infinite pity we may well have for those stern parents who, faithful to  what they considered their duty, missed so much of the sanity, sweetness  and joy of life, and thrust upon their babes, whose days should have  been filled with love and light and play, the dread of death and hell  and eternal damnation. It is with a touch of irony that we read that  Mather survived by thirty years this child whose infant mind was  tortured with visions of the grave. Yet a strange sort of pride seems to  have been taken in the capacity of children to imbibe such gloomy  theological theories and in the ability to repeat, parrotlike, the  oft-repeated doctrines of inherent sinfulness. One babe, two years old,  was able \"savingly to understand the Mysteries of Redemption\"; another  of the same age was \"a dear lover of faithful ministers\"; Anne  Greenwich, who, we are not surprised to discover, died at the age of  five, \"discoursed most astonishingly of great mysteries\"; Daniel  Bradley, when three years old, had an \"impression and inquisition of the  state of souls after death\"; Elizabeth Butcher, when only two and a half  years old, would ask herself as she lay in her cradle, \"What is my  corrupt nature?\" and would answer herself with the quotation, \"It is  empty of grace, bent unto sin, and only to sin, and that continually.\"  With such spiritual food were our ancestors fed--sometimes to the  eternal undoing of their posterity's physical and mental welfare.      _IV. Woman's Day of Rest_    It is possible that the Puritan woman gained one very material blessing  from the religion of her day; she was relieved of practically all work  on Sunday. The colonial Sabbath was indeed strictly observed; there was  little visiting, no picnicking, no heavy meals, no week-end parties,  none of the entertainments so prevalent in our own day. The wife and  mother was therefore spared the heavy tasks of Sunday so commonly  expected of the typical twentieth-century housewife. But it is doubtful  whether the alternative--attendance at church almost the entire  day--would appear one whit more desirable to the modern woman. The  Sabbath of those times was verily a period of religious worship. No one  must leave town, and no one must travel to town save for the church  service. There must be no work on the farm or in the city. Boats must  not be used except when necessary to transport people to divine service.  Fishing, hunting, and dancing were absolutely forbidden. No one must use  a horse, ox, or wagon if the church were within reasonable walking  distance, and \"reasonable\" was a most expansive word. Tobacco was not to  be smoked or chewed near any meeting-house. The odor of cooking food on  Sunday was an abomination in the nostrils of the Most High. And we  should bear in mind that these rules were enforced from sunset on  Saturday to sunset on Sunday--the twenty-four hours of the Puritan  Sabbath. The Holy Day, as spent by the preacher, John Cotton, may be  taken as typical of the strenuous hours of the Sabbath as observed by  many a New England pastor:    \"He began the Sabbath at evening, therefore then performed family duty  after supper, being longer than ordinary in exposition. After which he  catechized his children and servants, and then returned to his study.  The morning following, family worship being ended, he retired into his  study until the bell called him away. Upon his return from meeting  (where he had preached and prayed some hours), he returned again into  his study (the place of his labor and prayer), unto his favorite  devotion; where having a small repast carried him up for his dinner, he  continued until the tolling of the bell. The public service of the  afternoon being over, he withdrew for a space to his pre-mentioned  oratory for his sacred addresses to God, as in the forenoon, then came  down, repeated the sermon in the family, prayed, after supper sang a  Psalm, and toward bedtime betaking himself again to his study he closed  the day with prayer.\"    To many a modern reader such a method of spending Sunday for either  preacher or laymen would seem not only irksome but positively  detrimental to physical and mental health; but we should bear in mind  that the opportunity to sit still and listen after six days of strenuous  muscular toil was probably welcomed by the colonist, and, further, that  in the absence of newspapers and magazines and other intellectual  stimuli the oratory of the clergy, stern as it may have been, was  possibly an equal relief. Especially were such \"recreations\" welcomed by  the women; for their toil was as arduous as that of the men; while their  round of life and their means of receiving the stimulus of public  movements were even more restricted.      _V. Religion and Woman's Foibles_    The repressive characteristics of the creed of the hour were felt more  keenly by those women than probably any man of the period ever dreamed.  For woman seems to possess an innate love of the dainty and the  beautiful, and beauty was the work of Satan. Nothing was too small or  insignificant for this religion to examine and control. It even  regulated that most difficult of all matters to govern--feminine dress.  As Fisher says in his _Men, Women and Manners in Colonial Times_:         \"At every opportunity they raised some question of religion and       discussed it threadbare, and the more fine-spun and subtle it was       the more it delighted them. Governor Winthrop's Journal is full       of such questions as whether there could be an indwelling of the       Holy Ghost in a believer without a personal union; whether it was       lawful even to associate or have dealings with idolaters like the       French; whether women should wear veils. On the question of       veils, Roger Williams was in favor of them; but John Cotton one       morning argued so powerfully on the other side that in the       afternoon the women all came to church without them.\"         \"There were orders of the General Court forbidding 'short sleeves       whereby the nakedness of the arms may be discovered.' Women's       sleeves were not to be more than half an ell wide. There were to       be no 'immoderate great sleeves, immoderate ... knots of ryban,       broad shoulder bands and rayles, silk ruses, double ruffles and       cuffs.' The women were complained of because of their 'wearing       borders of hair and their cutting, curling, and immodest laying       out of their hair.'\"[13]    Petty details that would not receive a moment's consideration in our own  day aroused the theological scruples of those colonial pastors, and  moved them to interminable arguments which nicely balanced "]]]
