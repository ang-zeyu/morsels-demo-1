This hypothesis  explains the loss of weight, the lassitude, the indigestion,  the constipation, and the many alterations in the functions of the various  glands and organs of the digestive system in chronic appendicitis.  It readily explains also the extraordinary improvement in the digestive  functions and the general health which follows the removal  of an appendix which is so slightly altered physically that only  the clinical results could persuade one that this slight change could  be an adequate cause for such far-reaching and important symptoms.  This hypothesis explains certain gall-bladder phenomena likewise,--  indigestion, loss of weight, disturbed functions, etc.,--and it  may supply the explanation of the disturbance caused by an active  anal fissure, which is a potent noci-associator, and the consequent  disproportionate relief after the trivial operation for its cure.  Noci-association would well explain also the great functional disturbances  of the viscera which immediately follow abdominal operations.    Postoperative and traumatic neuroses are at once explained on  the ground of noci-association, the resulting strain from which,  upon the brain-cells, causes in them physical lesions.  If one were placed against a wall and were looking into the gun muzzles  of a squad of soldiers, and were told that there were nine chances  out of ten that he would not be killed outright when the volley  was fired, would it help him to be told that he must not be afraid?  Such an experience would be written indelibly on his brain.  This corresponds closely to the position in which some surgical patients  are placed.  In railway wrecks, we can readily understand the striking  difference between the after-effects in the passengers who were conscious  at the time of the accident and those who were asleep or drunk.  In the latter the noci-perceptors and receptors were not aroused,  hence their immunity to the nervous shock.  In the functional disturbances  of the pelvic organs, association and summation may play a large role.  On this hypothesis many cases of neurasthenia may well be explained.  From the behavior of the individual as a whole we may well conclude  that summation is but a scientific expression for \"nagging.\"  Many other pathologic phenomena may be explained in a similar manner.  Thus we can understand the variations in the gastric analyses in a  timid patient alarmed over his condition and afraid of the hospital.  He is integrated by fear, and as fear takes precedence over all  other impulses, no organ functionates normally.  For the same reason,  one sees animals in captivity pine away under the dominance of fear.  The exposure of a sensitive brain to the naked possibility of death from  a surgical operation may be compared to uncovering a photographic plate  in the bright sunlight to inspect it before putting it in the camera.  This principle explains, too, the physical influence of the physician  or surgeon, who, by his PERSONALITY, inspires, like a Kocher,  absolute confidence in his patient.  The brain, through its power  of phylogenetic association, controls many processes that have wholly  escaped from the notice of the \"practical man.\"  It is in accordance  with the law of association that a flower, a word, a touch, a cool breeze,  or even the thought of a fishing rod or of a gun, is helpful.  On the contrary, all suggestions of despair or misfortune--  a corrugated brow, the gloomy silence of despair, or a doubtful word--  are equally depressing.  In like manner, one could add many  illustrations of the symbolism that governs our daily lives.  Thus we see that through the laws of inheritance and noci-association,  we are able to read a new meaning into the clinical phenomena  of various diseases.      Observations on Patients whose Associational Centers are Dulled,  and on Diseases and Injuries of Regions not Endowed with Nociceptors      Reversing the order of our reasoning, let us now glance at the patient  who is unconscious and who, therefore, has lost much of the power  of association.  His mouth is usually dry, the digestive processes  are at a low ebb, the aroma of food causes no secretion of saliva,  tickling the nose causes no sneezing; he catches no cold.  The laryngeal reflex is lost and food may be quietly inhaled;  the entire process of metabolism is low.  The contrast between a man  whose associational centers are keen and a man in whom these centers  are dulled or lost is the contrast between life and death.    In accordance with the law of adaptation through natural selection,  phylogeny, and association, one would expect no pain in abscess  of the brain, in abscess of the liver, in pylephlebitis,  in infection of the hepatic vessels, in endocarditis.  This law explains why there are no nociceptors for cancer,  while there are active nociceptors for the acute infections.  It is because nature has no helpful response to offer against cancer,  while in certain of the acute pyogenic infections the nociceptors  force the beneficent physiologic rest.    Could we dispossess ourselves of the shackles of psychology,  forget its confusing nomenclature, and view the human brain,  as Sherrington has said, \"as the organ of, and for the adaptation  of nervous reaction,\" many clinical phenomena would appear in  a clearer light.      Natural Selection and Chemical Noci-association in the Infections      Thus far we have considered the behavior of the individual as a whole  in his response to a certain type of noci-influences. We have been voicing  our argument in terms of physical escape from GROSS physical dangers,  or of grappling with GROSS NERVE-MUSCULAR enemies of the same or of  other species.  To explain these phenomena we have invoked the aid  of the laws of natural selection and phylogenetic association.  If our conclusions be correct, then it should follow that in the same  laws we may find the explanation of immunity, which, of course,  means a defensive response to our MICROSCOPIC enemies.  There should  be no more difficulty in evolving an efficient army of phagocytes  by natural selection, or in developing specific chemical reactions  against _*microscopic enemies_, than there was in evolving the various  nociceptors for our nerve-muscular defense against our _*gross enemies_.  That immunity is a chemical reaction is no argument against  the application of the law of natural selection or of association.  What essential difference is there between the chemical defense of  the skunk against its NERVE-MUSCULAR enemies and its chemical defense  (immunity) against its MICROSCOPIC ENEMIES?    The administration of vaccines becomes the adequate stimulus which  awakens phylogenetic association of a chemical nature as a result  of which immune bodies are produced.    In discussing this subject I will raise only the question whether  or not the specific character of the inaugural symptoms of some  infectious diseases may be due to phylogenetic association.  These inaugural symptoms are measurably a recapitulation of the leading  phenomena of the disease in its completed clinical picture.  Thus, the furious initiative symptoms of pneumonia, of peritonitis,  or erysipelas, of the exanthemata, are exaggerations of phenomena  which are analogous to the phenomena accompanying physical injury  and fear of physical violence.  Just as the acute phenomena of fear,  or those which accompany the adequate stimulation of nociceptors,  are recapitulations of phylogenetic struggles, so may the inaugural  symptoms of an infection be a similar phylogenetic recapitulation  of the course of the disease.  A certain amount of negative  evidence is supplied by a comparison of the response to a dose  of toxins with the response to a dose of a standard drug.  No drug in therapeutic dosage except the iodin compounds causes  a febrile response; no drug causes a chill; on the other hand,  all specific toxins cause febrile responses and many cause chills.  If a species of animal had been poisoned by a drug during vast periods  of time, and if natural selection had successfully established  a self-defensive response, then the administration of that drug would  cause a noci-association (chemical), and a specific reaction analogous  to that following the administration of Coley's toxins might be expected.  Bacterial noci-association probably operates through the same  law as that through which physical noci-association operates.  Natural selection is impartial, however.  It must be supposed that it  acts impartially upon the microscopic invader and upon the host.  On this ground one must infer that, in accordance with the same law  of natural selection, the bacteria of acute infections have met  by natural selection each advance in the struggle of the host  for immunity.  Hence the fast and furious struggle between man  and his microscopic enemies merely indicates to what extent natural  selection has developed the ATTACK and the DEFENSE respectively.  This struggle is analogous to the quick and decisive battles  of the carnivora when fighting among themselves or when contending  against their ancient enemies.  But when phylogenetically strange  animals meet each other, they do not understand how to conduct a fight:  natural selection has not had the opportunity of teaching them.  The acute infections have the characteristics of being ancient enemies.  On this hypothesis one can understand the high mortality of measles  when it is introduced into a new country.  By natural selection,  measles has become a powerful enemy of the human race, and a race  to which this infection is newly introduced has not had the advantage  of building up a defense against it by the law of natural selection.
