The two great powers when combined could impose their  will on Germany; they forced through the Diet a series of measures  devoted to the restriction of the liberty of the press, the control of  the universities, and the suppression of democratic opinion.    The result of this was great discontent in Germany, which was especially  directed against Prussia; in 1830 the outbreak of revolution in Paris  had been followed by disturbances in many German States; Austria and  Prussia, however, were still strong enough to maintain the old system.  The whole intellect of the country was diverted to a policy of  opposition; in the smaller States of the south, Parliamentary government  had been introduced; and the great aim of the Liberals was to establish  a Parliament in Prussia also.    In 1840 the old King died; the son, Frederick William IV., was a man of  great learning, noble character, high aspirations; he was, however,  entirely without sympathy or understanding for the modern desires of his  countrymen; he was a child of the Romantic movement; at the head of the  youngest of European monarchies, he felt himself more at home in the  Middle Ages than in his own time. There could be no sympathy between him  and the men who took their politics from Rousseau and Louis Blanc, and  their religion from Strauss. It had been hoped that he would at once  introduce into Prussia representative institutions. He long delayed, and  the delay took away any graciousness from the act when at last it was  committed. By a royal decree published in 1822 it had been determined  that no new loan could be made without the assent of an assembly of  elected representatives; the introduction of railways made a loan  necessary, and at the beginning of 1847 Frederick William summoned for  the first time the States General.    The King of Prussia had thereby stirred up a power which he was unable  to control; he had hoped that he would be able to gather round him the  representatives of the nobles, the towns, and the peasants; that this  new assembly, collecting about him in respectful homage, would add  lustre to his throne; that they would vote the money which was required  and then separate. How much was he mistaken! The nation had watched for  years Parliamentary government in England and France; this was what they  wished to have, and now they were offered a modern imitation of  medieval estates. They felt themselves as grown men able and justified  in governing their own country; the King treated them as children. The  opening ceremony completed the bad impression which the previous acts of  the King had made. While the majority of the nation desired a formal and  written Constitution, the King in his opening speech with great emphasis  declared that he would never allow a sheet of paper to come between him  and God in heaven.    Bismarck was not present at the opening ceremony; it was, in fact, owing  to an accident that he was able to take his seat at all; he was there as  substitute for the member for the _Ritterschaft_ of Jerichow, who had  fallen ill. He entered on his Parliamentary duties as a young and almost  unknown man; he did not belong to any party, but his political  principles were strongly influenced by the friends he had found in  Pomerania. They were soon to be hardened by conflict and confirmed by  experience; during the first debates he sat silent, but his indignation  rose as he listened to the speeches of the Liberal majority. Nothing  pleased them; instead of actively co-operating with the Government in  the consideration of financial measures, they began to discuss and  criticise the proclamation by which they had been summoned. There was  indeed ample scope for criticism; the Estates were so arranged that the  representatives of the towns could always be outvoted by the landed  proprietors; they had not even the right of periodical meetings; the  King was not compelled to call them together again until he required  more money. They not only petitioned for increased powers, they demanded  them as a right; they maintained that an assembly summoned in this form  did not meet the intentions of previous laws; when they were asked to  allow a loan for a railway in East Prussia, they refused on the ground  that they were not a properly qualified assembly.    This was too much for Bismarck: the action of the King might have been  inconclusive; much that he said was indiscreet; but it remained true  that he had taken the decisive step; no one really doubted that Prussia  would never again be without a Parliament. It would be much wiser, as it  would be more chivalrous, to adopt a friendly tone and not to attempt to  force concessions from him. He was especially indignant at the statement  made that the Prussian people had earned constitutional government by  the part they took in the war of liberation; against this he protested:      \"In my opinion it is a bad service to the national honour to    assume that the ill-treatment and degradation that the Prussians    suffered from a foreign ruler were not enough to make our blood    boil, and to deaden all other feelings but that of hatred for the    foreigners.\"    When told that he was not alive at the time, he answered:      \"I cannot dispute that I was not living then, and I have been    genuinely sorry that I was not born in time to take part in that    movement; a regret which is diminished by what I have just heard.    I had always believed that the slavery against which we fought    lay abroad; I have just learned that it lay at home, and I am    not grateful for the explanation.\"    The ablest of the Liberal leaders was George v. Vincke; a member of an  old Westphalian family, the son of a high official, he was a man of  honesty and independence, but both virtues were carried to excess; a  born leader of opposition, domineering, quarrelsome, ill to please, his  short, sturdy figure, his red face and red hair were rather those of a  peasant than a nobleman, but his eloquence, his bitter invective, earned  the respect and even fear of his opponents. Among these Bismarck was to  be ranged; in these days began a rivalry which was not to cease till  nearly twenty years later, when Vincke retired from the field and  Bismarck stood triumphant, the recognised ruler of the State. At this  time it required courage in the younger man to cross swords with the  experienced and powerful leader.    Vincke was a strong Liberal, but in the English rather than the Prussian  sense; his constant theme was the rule of law; he had studied English  history, for at that time all Liberals prepared themselves for their  part by reading Hallam or Guizot and Dahlmann; he knew all about Pym and  Hampden, and wished to imitate them. The English Parliament had won its  power by means of a Petition of Right and a Bill of Rights; he wished  they should do the same in Prussia; it escaped him that the English  could appeal to charters and ancient privileges, but that in Prussia the  absolute power of the King was the undisputed basis on which the whole  State had been built up, and that every law to which they owed their  liberty or their property derived its validity from the simple  proclamation of the King.    Bismarck, if he had read less, understood better the characteristics of  England, probably because he knew better the conditions of his own  country. He rose to protest against these parallels with England;  Prussia had its own problems which must be settled in its own way.      \"Parallels with foreign countries have always something    disagreeable.... At the Revolution, the English people were in a    very different condition from that of Prussia to-day; after a    century of revolution and civil war, it was in a position to be    able to give away a crown and add conditions which William of    Orange accepted. On the other hand, we are in possession of a    crown whose rights were actually unlimited, a crown held by the    grace not of the people but of God, and which of its own    free-will has given away to the people a portion of its    rights--an example rare in history.\"    It shows how strong upon him was the influence of his friends in  Pomerania that his longest and most important speech was in defence of  the Christian monarchy. The occasion was a proposal to increase the  privileges of the Jews. He said:      \"I am no enemy of the Jews; if they become my enemies I will    forgive them. Under certain circumstances I love them; I am ready    to grant them all rights but that of holding the magisterial    office in a Christian State. This they now claim; they demand to    become Landrath, General, Minister, yes even, under    circumstances, Minister of Religion and Education. I allow that    I am full of prejudices, which, as I have said, I have sucked in    with my mother's milk; I cannot argue them away; for if I think    of a Jew face to face with me as a representative of the King's    sacred Majesty, and I have to obey him, I must confess that I    should feel myself deeply broken and depressed; the sincere    self-respect with which I now attempt to fulfil my duties towards    the State would leave me. I share these feelings with the mass of    the lower strata of the people, and I am not ashamed of their    society.\"    And then he spoke of the Christian State:      \"It is as old as every European State; it is the ground in which    they have taken root; no State has a secure existence unless it    has a religious foundation. For me, the words, 'by the Grace of    God,' which Christian rulers add to their name, are no empty    phrase; I see in them a confession that the Princes desire to    wield the sceptre which God has given them according to the will    of God on earth. As the will of God I can only recognise that    which has been revealed in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#7)"],[1,"virtue of  the earth extends upwards, as has been said, so very far, yet if any  stone should be at a distance great enough to become sensible compared  with the earth's diameter, it is true that on the motion of the earth  such a stone would not follow altogether; its own force of resistance  would be combined with the attractive force of the earth, and thus it  would extricate itself in some degree from the motion of the earth.\" The  above passage from the Introduction to Kepler's \"Commentaries on the  Motion of Mars,\" always regarded as his most valuable work, must have  been known to Newton, so that no such incident as the fall of an apple  was required to provide a necessary and sufficient explanation of the  genesis of his Theory of Universal Gravitation. Kepler's glimpse at such  a theory could have been no more than a glimpse, for he went no further  with it. This seems a pity, as it is far less fanciful than many of his  ideas, though not free from the \"virtues\" and \"animal faculties,\" that  correspond to Gilbert's \"spirits and humours\". We must, however, proceed  to the subject of Mars, which was, as before noted, the first important  investigation entrusted to Kepler on his arrival at Prague.    The time taken from one opposition of Mars to the next is decidedly  unequal at different parts of his orbit, so that many oppositions must  be used to determine the mean motion. The ancients had noticed that what  was called the \"second inequality,\" due as we now know to the orbital  motion of the earth, only vanished when earth, sun, and planet were in  line, i.e. at the planet's opposition; therefore they used oppositions  to determine the mean motion, but deemed it necessary to apply a  correction to the true opposition to reduce to mean opposition, thus  sacrificing part of the advantage of using oppositions. Tycho and  Longomontanus had followed this method in their calculations from  Tycho's twenty years' observations. Their aim was to find a position of  the \"equant,\" such that these observations would show a constant angular  motion about it; and that the computed positions would agree in latitude  and longitude with the actual observed positions. When Kepler arrived he  was told that their longitudes agreed within a couple of minutes of arc,  but that something was wrong with the latitudes. He found, however, that  even in longitude their positions showed discordances ten times as great  as they admitted, and so, to clear the ground of assumptions as far as  possible, he determined to use true oppositions. To this Tycho objected,  and Kepler had great difficulty in convincing him that the new move  would be any improvement, but undertook to prove to him by actual  examples that a false position of the orbit could by adjusting the  equant be made to fit the longitudes within five minutes of arc, while  giving quite erroneous values of the latitudes and second inequalities.  To avoid the possibility of further objection he carried out this  demonstration separately for each of the systems of Ptolemy, Copernicus,  and Tycho. For the new method he noticed that great accuracy was  required in the reduction of the observed places of Mars to the  ecliptic, and for this purpose the value obtained for the parallax by  Tycho's assistants fell far short of the requisite accuracy. Kepler  therefore was obliged to recompute the parallax from the original  observations, as also the position of the line of nodes and the  inclination of the orbit. The last he found to be constant, thus  corroborating his theory that the plane of the orbit passed through the  sun. He repeated his calculations no fewer than seventy times (and that  before the invention of logarithms), and at length adopted values for  the mean longitude and longitude of aphelion. He found no discordance  greater than two minutes of arc in Tycho's observed longitudes in  opposition, but the latitudes, and also longitudes in other parts of the  orbit were much more discordant, and he found to his chagrin that four  years' work was practically wasted. Before making a fresh start he  looked for some simplification of the labour; and determined to adopt  Ptolemy's assumption known as the principle of the bisection of the  excentricity. Hitherto, since Ptolemy had given no reason for this  assumption, Kepler had preferred not to make it, only taking for granted  that the centre was at some point on the line called the excentricity  (see Figs. 1, 2).    A marked improvement in residuals was the result of this step, proving,  so far, the correctness of Ptolemy's principle, but there still remained  discordances amounting to eight minutes of arc. Copernicus, who had no  idea of the accuracy obtainable in observations, would probably have  regarded such an agreement as remarkably good; but Kepler refused to  admit the possibility of an error of eight minutes in any of Tycho's  observations. He thereupon vowed to construct from these eight minutes a  new planetary theory that should account for them all. His repeated  failures had by this time convinced him that no uniformly described  circle could possibly represent the motion of Mars. Either the orbit  could not be circular, or else the angular velocity could not be  constant about any point whatever. He determined to attack the \"second  inequality,\" i.e. the optical illusion caused by the earth's annual  motion, but first revived an old idea of his own that for the sake of  uniformity the sun, or as he preferred to regard it, the earth, should  have an equant as well as the planets. From the irregularities of the  solar motion he soon found that this was the case, and that the motion  was uniform about a point on the line from the sun to the centre of the  earth's orbit, such that the centre bisected the distance from the sun  to the \"Equant\"; this fully supported Ptolemy's principle. Clearly then  the earth's linear velocity could not be constant, and Kepler was  encouraged to revive another of his speculations as to a force which was  weaker at greater distances. He found the velocity greater at the nearer  apse, so that the time over an equal arc at either apse was proportional  to the distance. He conjectured that this might prove to be true for  arcs at all parts of the orbit, and to test this he divided the orbit  into 360 equal parts, and calculated the distances to the points of  division. Archimedes had obtained an approximation to the area of a  circle by dividing it radially into a very large number of triangles,  and Kepler had this device in mind. He found that the sums of successive  distances from his 360 points were approximately proportional to the  times from point to point, and was thus enabled to represent much more  accurately the annual motion of the earth which produced the second  inequality of Mars, to whose motion he now returned. Three points are  sufficient to define a circle, so he took three observed positions of  Mars and found a circle; he then took three other positions, but  obtained a different circle, and a third set gave yet another. It thus  began to appear that the orbit could not be a circle. He next tried to  divide into 360 equal parts, as he had in the case of the earth, but the  sums of distances failed to fit the times, and he realised that the sums  of distances were not a good measure of the area of successive  triangles. He noted, however, that the errors at the apses were now  smaller than with a central circular orbit, and of the opposite sign, so  he determined to try whether an oval orbit would fit better, following a  suggestion made by Purbach in the case of Mercury, whose orbit is even  more eccentric than that of Mars, though observations were too scanty to  form the foundation of any theory. Kepler gave his fancy play in the  choice of an oval, greater at one end than the other, endeavouring to  satisfy some ideas about epicyclic motion, but could not find a  satisfactory curve. He then had the fortunate idea of trying an ellipse  with the same axis as his tentative oval. Mars now appeared too slow at  the apses instead of too quick, so obviously some intermediate ellipse  must be sought between the trial ellipse and the circle on the same  axis. At this point the \"long arm of coincidence\" came into play.  Half-way between the apses lay the mean distance, and at this position  the error was half the distance between the ellipse and the circle,  amounting to .00429 of a radius. With these figures in his mind, Kepler  looked up the greatest optical inequality of Mars, the angle between the  straight lines from Mars to the Sun and to the centre of the circle.[3]  The secant of this angle was 1.00429, so that he noted that an ellipse  reduced from the circle in the ratio of 1.00429 to 1 would fit the  motion of Mars at the mean distance as well as the apses.    [Footnote 3: This is clearly a maximum at AMC in Fig. 2, when its  tangent AC/CM = the eccentricity.]    It is often said that a coincidence like this only happens to somebody  who \"deserves his luck,\" but this simply means that recognition is  essential to the coincidence. In the same way the appearance of one of a  large number of people mentioned is hailed as a case of the old adage  \"Talk of the devil, etc.,\" ignoring all the people who failed to appear.  No one, however, will consider Kepler unduly favoured. His genius, in  his case certainly \"an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" enabled him  out of his medley of hypotheses, mainly unsound, by dint of enormous  labour and patience, to arrive thus at the first two of the laws which  established his title of \"Legislator of the Heavens\".
