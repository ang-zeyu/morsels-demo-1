[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#7)"],[1,"the god-like hero of  his charming novel, I do not think anyone can doubt, had he set himself  to do it, but it was part of the ineradicable Bohemianism of his  character and the realistic bent of his genius that made him shun the  representation of what he considered artificial and an outrage upon  nature.\"    This, it will perhaps be admitted, is not very good art-criticism.  Though in justice to its author it must be said that he did not wish to  be regarded as Keene's critic as well as biographer.    An artist does not argue with himself that he will shun the  representation of one particular side of life. He simply leaves it alone  because he cannot help it; it does not attract him. He draws just that  which interests him most and in the way in which it interests him; and  exactly to the measure of his interest does his drawing possess  vitality. Keene might have expressed with pungency his sense of certain  things as being artificial and outrageous, but as long as his feelings  towards them remained like that he could not express himself about them  in any other way, certainly not in du Maurier's way--that is, with du  Maurier's skill.    To the extent to which there _is_ a glamour and a beauty in fashion du  Maurier is a realist. People who only now and then become sensible of  the charm in things are provoked by its strangeness in art, and call it  romance, their definition for an untrue thing.      Section 3    During the period of thirty-six years over which du Maurier contributed  to _Punch_ the paper took upon itself a character unlike anything that  had preceded it in comic journalism; it created a tradition for itself  which placed it beside _The Times_--the \"Thunderer,\" as one of the  institutions of this country, recognised abroad as essentially  expressive of national character. English humour, like American and  French, has its own flavour; it lacks the high and extravagant fantasy  that is so exhilarating in America; it avoids the subtlety of France; it  is essentially a laughing humour. The Englishman, who cannot stand chaff  himself, always laughs at others. It is curious that while an  Englishman's conventions rest upon dislike of what is odd and  fantastic--precisely the two most well-known sources of humour--he yet  has a sense of humour. The first aim of every Englishman is to acquire a  manner of some dignity. It is the breaking down of that dignity in other  people that to his eyes places them in a light that is funny.    English humour seems to find its object in physical rather than mental  aspects. The very notable feature of du Maurier's work was that it  refined upon the characteristics of English humour; it dealt always with  people placed by an absurd speech, or an unlucky gesture, in a foolish  position--a position the shy distress of which was a physical  experience. Du Maurier's humour was also English in its kindness; the  points that are scored against the unfortunate object of it are the  points that may be scored against the laugher himself to-morrow. His  pictures were a running commentary upon the refinements of our manners  and upon the quick changes of moral costume that fresh situations in the  social comedy demand.    One thing peculiarly fitted the artist to be the satirist of English  Society--his love of the comedy of people by nature honest finding  themselves only able to get through the day with decent politeness by  the aid of \"the lie to follow.\" English people, Puritan by ancestry and  by inclination, are nevertheless driven into frequent subterfuge by  their good nature, and having pared their language and gesture of that  extravagance in expression which they despise in the foreigner, they are  thrown back upon a naturalness that betrays them in delicate  situations. The consequence is that it is in Anglo-Saxon Society at its  best that the art of delicate fence in conversation has been brought to  its highest pitch. There the _clairvoyance_ is so great that words can  be used economically in relation to the realities of life, and are  consequently often adopted merely as a screen before the feelings.    We have to realise how much more than any one preceding him in graphic  satire du Maurier was able to dispense with exaggeration. Nevertheless,  the studied avoidance of exaggeration has not had the happiest effect as  a precedent in the art of _Punch_. Without du Maurier's sensitive  response to the whole comedy of drawing-room life the tendency has been  to lapse into the merely photographic.    The similitude we have already described between du Maurier's art with  the pencil and the art of the modern novel is not complete until we have  extended it further in the direction of a comparison with novels of  George Meredith and Henry James in particular. Like these two writers du  Maurier loved comedy, and your appreciator of comedy cannot stand the  presence of a \"funny man.\" In the pages of _Punch_ it was Leech and not  du Maurier who first replaced the art of the merely \"funny man.\" He  began with the pencil the kind of art that would answer to Meredith's  description of the comic muse. Throughout _The Egoist_, by George  Meredith, a comedy in which Clara Middleton's life comes near to being  tragic, the air would clear at any moment if Sir Willoughby and Clara  had not both lost through over-civilisation the power of saying  precisely what they mean. The book is the story of how Clara tries to  find words, and of how, when she finds them, the conversational genius  of Willoughby seemingly deflects them from the meaning she intends them  to bear. It was in the mid-region between two people in conversation  where false constructions are put by either party upon what is said that  du Maurier, like Meredith himself, perceived the source of comedy was to  be found.      Section 4    We have already defined the drawing-room as a Victorian institution. It  belonged to an age that was willing to sacrifice too much to  appearances--one in which everyone seemed to live for appearances. It  was a sort of stage, occupied by people in afternoon or evening  costume, with even the chairs arranged, not where they were wanted, but  where they made a good appearance. Oscar Wilde suggested to the  Victorians that they shouldn't _arrange_ chairs; they should let them  occur. Against the false setting manners were bound to become  false--good manners becoming almost synonymous with perfect insincerity.  Perhaps the only thing that ever really came to life in a drawing-room  was the aesthetic movement! At its worst it was what we have described  it; at its best it was a sort of blind protest against the patterns of  chair-covers that the eye was bound to absorb while listening to the  inanities of drawing-room conversation. It is significant that the  aesthetic movement was a man's movement. Until the leader of the movement  appeared on the scene, the decoration of the Victorian, as distinct from  the Georgian parlour, or that of every other period, was woman's  business. Most of the Victorian patterns embodied naturalistic and  sentimental representations of flowers. It was with the disappearance of  the eighteenth-century tradition, when drawing-room decoration passed  out of the hands of men, that beauty disappeared. Women took to heaping  masses of drapery on to the mantelpieces which had once displayed  classic proportion; on to this drapery they pinned all sorts of horrible  fans. Du Maurier exposed it all, and he exposed, too, the aesthetes to  whom the salvation of the appearance of a suburban drawing-room could  come to mean more than anything else in life. Their fault was not  confined to this. He always brought their \"intensity\" as a charge  against them, for it is of the very genius of good manners to merely  froth about things which, if taken seriously, would tend to destroy  amenity.

O Miserie!        A baby castle, all a-flame      With many a flower that hath no name,          O Miserie!        It had a little moat all round:      A little drawbridge too she found;          O Miserie!        On which there stood a stately maid,      Like her in radiant locks arrayed....          O Miserie!        Save that her locks grew rank and wild,      By weaver's shuttle undefiled!...          O Miserie!        Who held her brush and comb, as if      Her faltering hands had waxed stiff,          O Miserie!        With baulkt endeavour! whence she sung      A chant, the burden whereof rung:          O Miserie!        \"These hands have striven in vain        To part      These locks that won GAUWAINE        His heart!\"]    It is interesting, as an addition to the comparison we have drawn  between Meredith and du Maurier, to note that of the illustrators to  Meredith's own novels it was the latter who seemed to experience life in  a mood similar to the author's. In illustrating _Harry Richmond_ he  secured the Meredithian sense of romance and of pedigree in scenes as  well as people. However modern Meredith's characters were, they were all  the children of old-fashioned people; within them all was the pride of  the family tree, and, in the scenes in which they move, the memory of an  older world. Du Maurier, too, in his art was a patrician, and when he  gave up romance and took to satire pure and simple he put both beauty  and dignity into the world that he described. All the time he was  drawing his Society world others were working the same vein. But to him  alone it seemed to be given to glimpse the splendour of it, and to  suggest the link of romance that holds the present and the past  together.

[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Syrian fort.]    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--The town-walls of Dapuer.]    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--City of Kadesh, Ramesseum.]    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Plan of the pavilion of Medinet Habu.]    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Elevation of pavilion, Medinet Habu.]    New methods of fortification were revealed to the Egyptians in the course  of the great Asiatic wars undertaken by the Pharaohs of the Eighteenth  Dynasty. The nomadic tribes of Syria erected small forts in which they took  refuge when threatened with invasion (fig. 37). The Canaanite and Hittite  cities, as Ascalon, Dapur, and Merom, were surrounded by strong walls,  generally built of stone and flanked with towers (fig. 38). Those which  stood in the open country, as, for instance, Qodshu (Kadesh), were enclosed  by a double moat (fig. 39). Having proved the efficacy of these new types  of defensive architecture in the course of their campaigns, the Pharaohs  reproduced them in the valley of the Nile. From the beginning of the  Nineteenth Dynasty, the eastern frontier of the Delta (always the weakest)  was protected by a line of forts constructed after the Canaanite model. The  Egyptians, moreover, not content with appropriating the thing, appropriated  also the name, and called these frontier towers by the Semitic name of  _Magdilu_ or Migdols. For these purposes, or at all events for cities which  were exposed to the incursions of the Asiatic tribes, brick was not deemed  to be sufficiently strong; hence the walls of Heliopolis, and even those of  Memphis, were faced with stone. Of these new fortresses no ruins remain;  and but for a royal caprice which happens to have left us a model Migdol in  that most unlikely place, the necropolis of Thebes, we should now be  constrained to attempt a restoration of their probable appearance from the  representations in certain mural tableaux. When, however, Rameses III.  erected his memorial temple[3] (figs. 40 and 41), he desired, in  remembrance of his Syrian victories, to give it an outwardly military  aspect. Along the eastward front of the enclosure there accordingly runs a  battlemented covering wall of stone, averaging some thirteen feet in  height. The gate, protected by a large quadrangular bastion, opened in the  middle of this wall. It was three feet four inches in width, and was  flanked by two small oblong guard-houses, the flat roofs of which stood  about three feet higher than the ramparts. Passing this gate, we stand face  to face with a real Migdol. Two blocks of building enclose a succession of  court-yards, which narrow as they recede, and are connected at the lower  end by a kind of gate-house, consisting of one massive gateway surmounted  by two storeys of chambers. The eastward faces of the towers rise above an  inclined basement, which slopes to a height of from fifteen to sixteen feet  from the ground. This answered two purposes. It increased the strength of  the wall at the part exposed to sappers; it also caused the rebound of  projectiles thrown from above, and so helped to keep assailants at a  distance. The whole height is about seventy-two feet, and the width of each  tower is thirty-two feet. The buildings situate at the back, to right and  left of the gate, were destroyed in ancient times. The details of the  decoration are partly religious, partly triumphal, as befits the character  of the structure. It is unlikely, however, that actual fortresses were  adorned with brackets and bas-relief sculptures, such as we here see on  either side of the fore-court. Such as it is, the so-called \"pavilion\" of  Medinet Habu offers an unique example of the high degree of perfection to  which the victorious Pharaohs of this period had carried their military  architecture.    Material evidence fails us almost entirely, after the reign of Rameses III.  Towards the close of the eleventh century B.C., the high-priests of Amen  repaired the walls of Thebes, of Gebeleyn, and of El Hibeh opposite Feshn.  The territorial subdivision of the country, which took place under the  successors of Sheshonk, compelled the provincial princes to multiply their  strongholds. The campaign of Piankhi on the banks of the Nile is a series  of successful sieges. Nothing, however, leads us to suppose that the art of  fortification had at that time made any distinct progress; and when the  Greek rulers succeeded the native Pharaohs, they most probably found it at  much the same stage as it was left by the engineers of the Nineteenth and  Twentieth Dynasties.      [3] At Medinet Habu.          3.--PUBLIC WORKS.      A permanent network of roads would be useless in a country like Egypt. The  Nile here is the natural highway for purposes of commerce, and the pathways  which intersect the fields suffice for foot-passengers, for cattle, and for  the transport of goods from village to village. Ferry-boats for crossing  the river, fords wherever the canals were shallow enough, and embanked dams  thrown up here and there where the water was too deep for fordings,  completed the system of internal communication. Bridges were rare. Up to  the present time, we know of but one in the whole territory of ancient  Egypt; and whether that one was long or short, built of stone or of wood,  supported on arches or boldly flung across the stream from bank to bank, we  cannot even conjecture. This bridge, close under the very walls of Zaru,[4]  crossed the canal which separated the eastern frontier of Egypt from the  desert regions of Arabia Petraea. A fortified enclosure protected this  canal on the Asiatic side, as shown in the accompanying illustration (fig.  42). The maintenance of public highways, which figures as so costly an item  in the expenses of modern nations, played, therefore, but a very small part  in the annual disbursements of the Pharaohs, who had only to provide for  the due execution of three great branches of government works,--namely,  storage, irrigation, mining and quarrying.    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Canal and bridge, Zaru, Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--Cellar, with amphorae.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44.--Granary.]    The taxation of ancient Egypt was levied in kind, and government servants  were paid after the same system. To workmen, there were monthly  distributions of corn, oil, and wine, wherewith to support their families;  while from end to end of the social scale, each functionary, in exchange  for his labour, received cattle, stuffs, manufactured goods, and certain  quantities of copper or precious metals. Thus it became necessary that the  treasury officials should have the command of vast storehouses for the safe  keeping of the various goods collected under the head of taxation. These  were classified and stored in separate quarters, each storehouse being  surrounded by walls and guarded by vigilant keepers. There was enormous  stabling for cattle; there were cellars where the amphorae were piled in  regular layers (fig. 43), or hung in rows upon the walls, each with the  date written on the side of the jar; there were oven-shaped granaries where  the corn was poured in through a trap at the top (fig. 44), and taken out  through a trap at the bottom. At Thuku, identified with Pithom by M.  Naville,[5] the store-chambers (A) are rectangular and of different  dimensions (fig. 45), originally divided by floors, and having no  communication with each other. Here the corn had to be not only put in but  taken out through the aperture at the top. At the Ramesseum, Thebes,  thousands of ostraka and jar-stoppers found upon the spot prove that the  brick-built remains at the back of the temple were the cellars of the local  deity. The ruins consist of a series of vaulted chambers, originally  surmounted by a platform or terrace (fig. 46). At Philae, Ombos,  Daphnae,[6] and most of the frontier towns of the Delta, there were  magazines of this description, and many more will doubtless be discovered  when made the object of serious exploration.    [Illustration: Fig. 45.--Plan of Pithom.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Store-chambers of the Ramesseum.]    [Illustration: Fig. 47.--Dike at Wady Gerraweh.]    The irrigation system of Egypt is but little changed since the olden time.  Some new canals have been cut, and yet more have been silted up through the  negligence of those in power; but the general scheme, and the methods  employed, continue much the same, and demand but little engineering skill.  Wherever I have investigated the remains of ancient canals, I have been  unable to detect any traces of masonry at the weak points, or at the  mouths, of these cuttings. They are mere excavated ditches, from twenty to  sixty or seventy feet in width. The earth flung out during the work was  thrown to right and left, forming irregular embankments from seven to  fourteen feet in height. The course of the ancient canals was generally  straight: but that rule was not strictly observed, and enormous curves  were often described in order to avoid even slight irregularities of  surface. Dikes thrown up from the foot of the cliffs to the banks of the  Nile divided the plain at intervals into a series of artificial basins,  where the overflow formed back-waters at the time of inundation. These  dikes are generally earth-works, though they are sometimes constructed of  baked brick, as in the province of Girgeh. Very rarely are they built of  hewn stone, like that great dike of Kosheish which was constructed by Mena  in primaeval times, in order to divert the course of the Nile from the spot  on which he founded Memphis.[7] The network of canals began near Silsilis  and extended to the sea-board, without ever losing touch of the river, save  at one spot near Beni Suef, where it throws out a branch in the direction  of the Fayum. Here, through a narrow and sinuous gorge, deepened probably  by the hand of man, it passes the rocky barrier which divides that"]]]
