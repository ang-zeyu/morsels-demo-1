Use one quart of peas to one  gallon of water. Boil about two hours with the following vegetables: a  few potatoes, a large celery root, a little parsley and a little onion,  a small carrot cut up in cubes and a small clove of garlic. When boiled  down to half the quantity, press all through colander. If soup is too  thin, take a tablespoon of flour blended with a little cold water in a  saucepan and add to the peas already strained. Serve with croutons.      TOMATO SOUP WITH RICE    Brown slightly one minced onion in one tablespoon of butter, add one can  of tomatoes or a quart of medium sized tomatoes cut in small pieces,  season with salt, pepper, one tablespoon of sugar and a pinch of  paprika. Simmer a half hour, strain and thicken with one tablespoon of  flour moistened with cold water, add the strained tomatoes and one cup  of boiled rice; let come to a boil and serve.      MILK AND CHEESE SOUP    Thicken three cups of milk with one-half tablespoon of flour and cook  thoroughly in a double boiler, stirring very often. When ready to serve  add one cup of grated cheese and season with salt and paprika.      BLACK BEAN SOUP    Soak one pint of beans over night, drain, add cold water and rinse  thoroughly. Fry two tablespoons of chopped onion in two tablespoons of  butter, put in with the beans, add two stalks of celery or a piece of  celery root and two quarts of water. Cook slowly until the beans are  soft, three or four hours, add more boiling water as it boils away; rub  through a strainer, add one-eighth teaspoon of pepper, one-fourth  teaspoon of mustard, a few grains of cayenne. Heat one tablespoon of  butter in saucepan with two tablespoons of flour, then two-thirds cup  and then the rest of the soup gradually; cut a lemon (removing seeds)  and two hard-boiled eggs in slices and serve in the soup.      BARLEY AND VEGETABLE SOUP    Take a half cup of coarse barley and two quarts of water. Let boil for  one hour and skim. Then add two onions, a bunch of carrots, parsley, two  turnips, one green pepper and six tomatoes (all chopped fine). Add a few  green peas, lima beans, two ears of corn cut from cob; pepper and salt  to taste. Cook for one hour or more until done. Then add a small piece  of butter, quarter teaspoon of sage and thyme, if you like, and if soup  is too thick add more water.      BEER SOUP (PARVE)    Mix the beer with one-third water, boil with sugar and the grated crust  of stale rye bread, add stick cinnamon and a little lemon juice. Pour  over small pieces of zwieback (rusk). Some boil a handful of dried  currants. When done add both currants and juice.      BEET SOUP (RUSSIAN STYLE)    Cut two small beets in strips, cover with water and let cook until  tender, add citric acid (sour salt) and a little sugar to make sweet and  sour, a little salt, and three-quarter cup of sour cream. Serve cold.  Sweet cream may be used and while hot gradually poured over the  well-beaten yolks of two eggs, keeping the soup over the stove and  stirring all the time until thick and smooth. Remove from stove and  serve cold.      CHERRY SOUP    This soup is a summer soup and is to be eaten cold. Cook two tablespoons  of sago in one cup of boiling water until tender, add more as water  boils down. Put one quart of large red or black cherries, one cup of  claret, one tablespoon of broken cinnamon, one-fourth cup of sugar, and  one-half lemon sliced fine, up to boil and let boil fifteen minutes; add  the cooked sago, let boil up and pour very gradually over the  well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Serve cold. Raspberry, strawberry,  currant, gooseberry, apple, plum or rhubarb soups are prepared the same  way, each cooked until tender and sweetened to taste. The juice of lemon  may be used instead of the wine.      FRUIT SOUP    Take two pounds of plums, cherries, or red currants and raspberries,  which carefully pick and wash, and boil to a pulp with a pint of water.  Let it slightly cool and then stir in the beaten yolk of an egg and a  little sugar. Strain the soup, which should be served cold.      COLD SOUR SOUP    Take a pound of sour grass (sorrel), remove leaves, wash well, cut and  squeeze well. Peel three potatoes, mince a bunch of young onions, salt  and set on to boil, when boiling add the sour grass and let boil well,  add two tablespoons of sugar, and a bit of sour salt, let simmer a bit,  afterward add two well-beaten eggs. Do not boil this soup after adding  the eggs. This soup is to be eaten cold. It can be kept for some time in  jars.          *GARNISHES AND DUMPLINGS FOR SOUPS*      NOODLES    Beat one large egg slightly with one-fourth teaspoon of salt, add enough  flour to make a stiff dough; work it well for fifteen or twenty minutes,  adding flour when necessary. When the dough is smooth place on slightly  floured board and roll out very thin and set aside on a clean towel for  an hour or more to dry. Fold in a tight roll and cut crosswise in fine  threads. Toss them up lightly with fingers to separate well, and spread  them on the board to dry. When thoroughly dry, put in a jar covered with  cheese cloth for future use. Drop by handfuls in boiling soup, ten  minutes before serving.    Noodles for vegetables or for puddings are made in the same way, but to  each egg, one-half egg-shell full of cold water may be added. The strips  are cut one-half inch wide.      PLAETCHEN    Take noodle dough, roll out thin in same manner as noodles, when dry cut  in three-inch strips, place the strips on top of one another, then cut  into one-half inch strips, crosswise, cut again to form one-half inch  squares. Dry same as noodles. Drop by handfuls in boiling soup.      KREPLECH OR BUTTERFLIES    Roll noodle dough into pieces two and one-half inches square. Place on  each one tablespoon of force-meat, then fold squares into three corned  pockets, pressing edges well together. Drop in boiling soup or salted  water and boil fifteen minutes.      FORCE-MEAT FOR KREPLECH    Chop one pound of beef, soup meat, cold veal, or take lamb chopped very  fine, season with one teaspoon of salt, one-eighth teaspoon of pepper,  ginger or nutmeg, one-half teaspoon of onion juice, mix with one egg.  This force-meat may also be made into balls one-half inch in diameter,  roll the balls in flour and cook them in the boiling soup, or fry them  in fat.      BAKING POWDER DUMPLINGS    Sift one cup of flour, one-fourth teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of  baking powder, stir in scant one-half cup of milk or water and mix to a  smooth batter. Drop one teaspoonful at a time in the boiling soup; cover  kettle, let boil five minutes and serve at once.      CROUTONS    Cut stale bread into cubes, place in pan and brown in the oven; or  butter the bread, cut into cubes and then brown the same way. Fry small  cubes of stale bread in deep hot fat until brown or fry them in a little  butter or fat in a hot spider until brown.      PFAeRVEL OR GRATED EGG FOR SOUP    Into the yolk of one egg stir enough flour until it is too stiff to  work. Grate on coarse grater, and spread on board to dry. After soup is  strained, put in and boil ten minutes before serving.      SPATZEN    Beat one egg well, add one-half teaspoon of salt, three-fourths cup of  flour and one-third cup of water, stirring to a stiff, smooth batter.  Drop by teaspoons into boiling soup ten minutes before serving.      EGG CUSTARD    Beat slightly the yolks of two eggs, add two tablespoons of milk and a  few grains of salt. Pour into small buttered cup, place in pan of hot  water and bake until firm; cool, remove from cup and cut in fancy shapes  with French vegetable cutters.      GRATED IRISH POTATO    Peel, wash and grate one large Irish potato, or two medium-sized ones.  Put it in a sieve and let hot water run over it until it is perfectly  white. Have the white of one egg beaten to a very stiff froth, then stir  in the potatoes and twenty minutes before serving add it to the boiling  soup. Beat the yolk of one egg up in the soup tureen, and pour the hot  soup over it, stirring carefully at first.      FARINA DUMPLINGS    Put in a double boiler one kitchen spoon of fresh butter, stir in one  cup of milk. When it begins to boil stir in enough farina to thicken.  Take off the stove and when cold add the yolks of two eggs and the  stiffly-beaten whites, and a little salt and nutmeg and one-half cup of  grated almonds if desired. Let cool, then make into little balls, and  ten minutes before soup is to be served, drop in boiler and let boil up  once or twice.      BOILED FLOUR BALLS WITH ALMONDS    Two yolks of eggs beaten very light, add a pinch of salt, pepper and  finely-chopped parsley. Add six blanched almonds grated, enough sifted  flour to make stiff batter, then add the stiffly-beaten whites of eggs  and one-half teaspoon of baking powder. Drop by teaspoons in soup ten  minutes before serving.      EINLAUF (EGG DROP)    Beat one egg, add one-eighth teaspoon of salt, three tablespoons of  flour and one-fourth cup of water, stir until smooth. Pour slowly from a  considerable height from the end of a spoon into the boiling soup. Cook  two or three minutes and serve hot; add one teaspoon of chopped parsley  to the soup.      EGG DUMPLINGS FOR SOUPS    Rub the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a smooth paste, add a little  salt and grated nutmeg and one-half teaspoon of melted butter. Add the  chopped whites of two eggs and a raw egg yolk to be able to mold the  dough into little marbles, put in boiling soup one minute.      SCHWEM KLOESSE    Take three tablespoons of flour; stir with one egg and one-half cup of  milk; pour this in a pan in which some butter was melted; stir until it  loosens from the pan. When it is cold, add two more eggs and some salt,  and shortly before needed form in little dumplings and put in boiling  hot soup for five minutes.      DUMPLINGS FOR CREAM SOUPS    Scald some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12351"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 07 (#7)"],[1,"ry; because they give  us, at the same time, an opportunity for more closely investigating the  question that presents the greatest difficulty, and for indicating a  branch of the subject which will have to be enlarged on in the sequel.    1. One of these points is that passage in history which informs us that  the Greek Anaxagoras was the first to enunciate the doctrine that  [GREEK: nous],--Understanding in general, or Reason, governs the world.  It is not intelligence as self-conscious Reason--not a spirit as such  that is meant; and we must clearly distinguish these from each other.  The movement of the solar system takes place according to unchangeable  laws. These laws are Reason, implicit in the phenomena in question; but  neither the sun nor the planets which revolve around it according to  these laws can be said to have any consciousness of them.    A thought of this kind--that nature is an embodiment of Reason, that is,  unchangeably subordinate to universal laws--appears nowise striking or  strange to us. We are accustomed to such conceptions and find nothing  extraordinary in them; and I have mentioned this extraordinary  occurrence partly to show how history teaches that ideas of this kind,  which may seem trivial to us, have not always been in the world; that,  on the contrary, such a thought makes an epoch in the annals of human  intelligence. Aristotle says of Anaxagoras, as the originator of the  thought in question, that he appeared as a sober man among the drunken.  Socrates adopted the doctrine from Anaxagoras, and it forthwith became  the ruling idea in philosophy--except in the school of Epicurus, who  ascribed all events to chance. \"I was delighted with the sentiment,\"  Plato makes Socrates say, \"and hoped I had found a teacher who would  show me Nature in harmony with Reason, who would demonstrate in each  particular phenomenon its specific aim, and, in the whole, the grand  object of the universe. I would not have surrendered this hope for a  great deal. But how very much was I disappointed, when, having zealously  applied myself to the writings of Anaxagoras, I found that he adduces  only external causes, such as atmosphere, ether, water, and the like.\"  It is evident that the defect which Socrates complains of respecting  Anaxagoras' doctrine does not concern the principle itself, but the  shortcoming of the propounder in applying it to nature in the concrete.  Nature is not deduced from that principle; the latter remains, in fact,  a mere abstraction, inasmuch as the former is not comprehended and  exhibited as a development of it--an organization produced by and from  Reason. I wish, at the very outset, to call your attention to the  important difference between a conception, a principle, a truth limited  to an abstract form, and its determinate application and concrete  development. This distinction affects the whole fabric of philosophy;  and among other bearings of it there is one to which we shall have to  revert at the close of our view of universal history, in investigating  the aspect of political affairs in the most recent period.    We have next to notice the rise of this idea that Reason directs the  world, in connection with a further application of it well known to  us--in the form, viz., of the religious truth that the world is not  abandoned to chance and external contingent causes, but that a  Providence controls it. I stated above that I would not make a demand on  your faith in regard to the principle announced. Yet I might appeal to  your belief in it, in this religious aspect, if as a general rule, the  nature of philosophical science allowed it to attach authority to  presuppositions. To put it in another shape--this appeal is forbidden,  because the science of which we have to treat proposes itself to furnish  the proof, not indeed of the abstract truth of the doctrine, but of its  correctness as compared with facts. The truth, then, that a Providence  (that of God) presides over the events of the world consorts with the  proposition in question; for Divine Providence is wisdom, endowed with  an infinite power, which realizes its aim, viz., the absolute rational  design of the world. Reason is thought conditioning itself with perfect  freedom. But a difference--rather a contradiction--will manifest itself  between this belief and our principle, just as was the case in reference  to the demand made by Socrates in the case of Anaxagoras' dictum. For  that belief is similarly indefinite; it is what is called a belief in a  general providence, and is not followed out into definite application,  or displayed in its bearing on the grand total--the entire course of  human history. But to explain history is to depict the passions of  mankind, the genius, the active powers, that play their part on the  great stage; and the providentially determined process which these  exhibit constitutes what is generally called the \"plan\" of Providence.  Yet it is this very plan which is supposed to be concealed from our  view, which it is deemed presumption even to wish to recognize. The  ignorance of Anaxagoras as to how intelligence reveals itself in actual  existence was ingenuous. Neither in his consciousness, nor in that of  Greece at large, had that thought been further expanded. He had not  attained the power to apply his general principle to the concrete, so as  to deduce the latter from the former; it was Socrates who took the first  step in comprehending the union of the concrete with the universal.  Anaxagoras, then, did not take up a hostile position toward such an  application; the common belief in Providence does; at least it opposes  the use of the principle on a large scale, and denies the possibility of  discerning the plan of Providence. In isolated cases this plan is  supposed to be manifest. Pious persons are encouraged to recognize in  particular circumstances something more than mere chance, to acknowledge  the guiding hand of God; for instance, when help has unexpectedly come  to an individual in great perplexity and need. But these instances of  providential design are of a limited kind, and concern the  accomplishment of nothing more than the desires of the individual in  question. But in the history of the world, the individuals we have to do  with are peoples, totalities that are States. We cannot, therefore, be  satisfied with what we may call this \"peddling\" view of Providence, to  which the belief alluded to limits itself. Equally unsatisfactory is the  merely abstract, undefined belief in a Providence, when that belief is  not brought to bear upon the details of the process which it conducts.  On the contrary our earnest endeavor must be directed to the recognition  of the ways of Providence, the means it uses, and the historical  phenomena in which it manifests itself; and we must show their  connection with the general principle above mentioned. But in noticing  the recognition of the plan of Divine Providence generally, I have  implicitly touched upon a prominent question of the day, viz., that of  the possibility of knowing God; or rather--since public opinion has  ceased to allow it to be a matter of question--the doctrine that it is  impossible to know God. In direct contravention of what is commanded in  holy Scripture as the highest duty--that we should not merely love, but  know God--the prevalent dogma involves the denial of what is there  said--namely, that it is the Spirit, _der Geist_, that leads into truth,  knows all things, penetrates even into the deep things of the Godhead.  While the Divine Being is thus placed beyond our knowledge and outside  the limit of all human things, we have the convenient license of  wandering as far as we list, in the direction of our own fancies. We are  freed from the obligation to refer our knowledge to the Divine and True.  On the other hand, the vanity and egoism which characterize our  knowledge find, in this false position, ample justification; and the  pious modesty which puts far from itself the knowledge of God can well  estimate how much furtherance thereby accrues to its own wayward and  vain strivings. I have been unwilling to leave out of sight the  connection between our thesis--that Reason governs and has governed the  world--and the question of the possibility of a knowledge of God,  chiefly that I might not lose the opportunity of mentioning the  imputation against philosophy of being shy of noticing religious truths,  or of having occasion to be so; in which is insinuated the suspicion  that it has anything but a clear conscience in the presence of these  truths. So far from this being the case, the fact is that in recent  times philosophy has been obliged to defend the domain of religion  against the attacks of several theological systems. In the Christian  religion God has revealed Himself--that is, He has given us to  understand what He is, with the result that He is no longer a concealed  or secret existence. And this possibility of knowing Him, thus afforded  us, renders such knowledge a duty. God wishes for His children no  narrow-hearted souls or empty heads, but those whose spirit is of itself  indeed, poor, but rich in the knowledge of Him, and who regard this  knowledge of God as the only valuable possession. That development of  the thinking spirit, which has resulted from the revelation of the  Divine Being as its original basis, must ultimately advance to the  intellectual comprehension of what was presented, in the first instance,  to feeling and imagination. The time must eventually come for  understanding that rich product of active Reason which the history of  the world offers to us. It was for a while the fashion to profess  admiration for the wisdom of God, as displayed in animals, plants, and  isolated occurrences. But if it be allowed that Providence manifests  itself in such objects and forms of existence, why not also in universal  history? This is deemed too great "]]]
