The majority of burghers, unaccustomed to  journeying in railway trains, relished the innovation and managed to make  merry even though six of them, together with all their saddles and  personal luggage, were crowded into one compartment. The singing of hymns  occupied much of their time on the journey, and when they tired of this  they played practical jokes upon one another and amused themselves by  leaning out of the windows and jeering at the men who were guarding the  railway bridges and culverts. At the stations they grasped their  coffee-pots and rushed to the locomotive to secure hot water with which to  prepare their beverage. It seldom happened that any Boer going to the  front carried any liquor with him and, although the delays and vexations  of the journey were sufficiently irritating to serve as an excuse,  drunkenness practically never occurred. Genuine good-fellowship prevailed  among them, and no quarrelling was to be observed. It seemed as if every  one of them was striving to live the ideal life portrayed in the Testament  which they read assiduously scores of times every day. Whether a train was  delayed an hour at a siding or whether it stopped so suddenly that all  were thrown from their seats, there was no profane language, but usually  jesting and joking instead. Little discomforts which would cause an  ordinary American or European soldier to use volumes of profanity were  passed by without notice or comment by these psalm-singing Boers, and  inconveniences of greater moment, like the disarrangement of the  commissariat along the route, caused only slight remonstrances from them.  An angry man was as rarely seen as one who cursed, and more rare than  either was an intoxicated one.    Few of the men were given to boasting of the valour they would display in  warfare or of their abilities in marksmanship. They had no battle-cry of  revenge like \"Remember the _Maine!_\" or \"Avenge Majuba!\" except it was the  motto: \"For God, Country, and Independence!\" which many bore on the bands  of their hats and on the stocks of their rifles. Very occasionally one  boasted of the superiority of the Boer, and still more rarely would one be  heard to set three months as the limit required to conquer the British  army. The name of Jameson, the raider, was frequently heard, but always in  a manner which might have led one unacquainted with recent Transvaal  history to believe that he was a patron-saint of the Republic. It was not  a cry of \"Remember Jameson\" for the wrongs he committed but rather a plea  to honour him for having placed the Republic on its guard against the  dangers which they believed threatened it from beyond its borders. It was  frequently suggested, when his name was mentioned, that after the war a  monument should be erected to him because he had given them warning and  that they had profited by the warning to the extent that they had armed  themselves thoroughly. Seldom was any boasting concerning the number of  the enemy that would fall to Boer bullets; instead there was a tone of  sorrow when they spoke of the soldiers of the Queen who would die on the  field of battle while fighting for a cause concerning the justice or  injustice of which the British soldier could not speak.    After the commando-train reached its destination the burghers again took  charge of their own horses and conveyances, and in even less time than it  required to place them on the train they were unloaded and ready to  proceed to the point where the generals needed their assistance. The Boer  was always considerate of his horse, and it became a custom to delay for  several hours after leaving the train, in order that the animals might  feed and recover from the fatigues of the journey before starting out on a  trek over the veld. After the horses had been given an opportunity to  rest, the order to \"upsaddle\" came from the commandant, and then the  procession, with the ox-waggons in the van, was again formed. The regular  army order was then established, scouts were sent ahead to determine the  location of the enemy, and the officers for the first time appeared to  lead their men in concerted action against the opposing forces. To call  the Boer force an army was to add unwarranted elasticity to the word, for  it had but one quality in common with such armed forces as Americans or  Europeans are accustomed to call by that name. The Boer army fought with  guns and gunpowder, but it had no discipline, no drills, no forms, no  standards, and not even a roll-call. It was an enlarged edition of the  hunting parties which a quarter-century ago went into the Zoutpansberg in  search of game--it was a massive aggregation of lion-hunters.          CHAPTER III    THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOER ARMY      A visitor in one of the laagers in Natal once spoke of a Boer burgher as a  \"soldier.\" A Boer from the Wakkerstroom district interrupted his speech  and said there were no Boer soldiers. \"If you want us to understand  concerning whom you are talking,\" he continued, \"you must call us burghers  or farmers. Only the English have soldiers.\" It was so with all the Boers;  none understood the term soldier as applying to anybody except their  enemy, while many considered it an insult to be called a soldier, as it  implied, to a certain extent, that they were fighting for hire. In times  of peace the citizen of the Boer republics was called a burgher, and when  he took up arms and went to war he received no special title to  distinguish him from the man who remained at home. \"My burghers,\" Paul  Kruger was wont to call them before the war, and when they came forth from  battle they were content when he said, \"My burghers are doing well.\" The  Boers were proud of their citizenship, and when their country was in  danger they went forth as private citizens and not as bold warriors to  protect it.    There was a law in the two republics which made it incumbent upon all  burghers between the ages of sixteen and sixty to join a commando and to  go to war when it was necessary. There was no law, however, which  prevented a man, of whatever youthfulness or age, to assist in the defence  of his country, and in consequence the Boer commandos contained almost the  entire male population between the ages of thirteen and eighty years. In  peaceful times the Boer farmer rarely travelled away from his home unless  he was accompanied by his family, and he would have felt the pangs of  homesickness if he had not been continually surrounded by his wife and  children. When the war began it was not an easy matter for the burgher to  leave his home for an indefinite period, and in order that he might not be  lonely he took with him all his sons who were strong enough to carry  rifles. The Boer youth develops into manhood early in life in the mild  South African climate, and the boy of twelve and thirteen years is the  equal in physical development of the American or European youth of sixteen  or seventeen. He was accustomed to live on the open veld and hunting with  his elders, and, when he saw that all his former companions were going to  war, he begged for permission to accompany the commando. The Boer boy of  twelve does not wear knickerbocker trousers as the youth of like age in  many other countries, but he is clothed exactly like his father, and,  being almost as tall, his youthful appearance is not so noticeable when he  is among a large number of his countrymen. Scores of boys not more than  twelve years were in the laagers in Natal, and hundreds of less age than  the minimum prescribed by the military law were in every commando in the  country. When Ladysmith was still besieged one youth of eleven years was  conspicuous in the Standerton laager. He seemed to be a mere child, yet he  had the patriotism of ten men. He followed his father everywhere, whether  into battle or to the spring for water.

When General De Wet captured seven cannon  from the enemy at the battle of Sannaspost two of the volunteers to  operate them were boys aged respectively fourteen and fifteen years.  Pieter J. Henning, of the Potchefstroom commando, who was injured in the  battle of Scholtznek on December 11th, was less than fifteen years old,  yet his valour in battle was as conspicuous as that of any of the burghers  who took part in the engagement. Teunis H.C. Mulder, of the Pretoria  commando, celebrated his sixteenth birthday only a few days before he was  twice wounded at Ladysmith on November 9th, and Willem Francois Joubert, a  relative of the Commandant-General, was only fifteen years old when he was  wounded at Ladysmith on October 30th. At the battle of Koedoesrand,  fifteen-year-old Pieter de Jager, of the Bethlehem commando, was seriously  injured by a shell while he was conveying his injured father from the  field. With the army of General Cronje captured at Paardeberg were no less  than a hundred burghers who had not reached the sixteenth year, and among  those who escaped from the laager in the river-bed were two Bloemfontein  boys named Roux, aged twelve and fourteen years. At Colenso a Wakkerstroom  youth of twelve years captured three English scouts and compelled them to  march ahead of him to the commandant's tent. During one of the lulls in  the fighting at Magersfontein a burgher of fifteen years crept up to  within twenty yards of three British soldiers and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#7)"],[1," 60: Beethoven died in 1827, the year when Berlioz was writing  his first important work, the _Ouverture des Francs-Juges_.]    The zenith of Berlioz's genius was reached, when he was thirty-five  years old, with the _Requiem_ and _Romeo_. They are his two most  important works, and are two works about which one may feel very  differently. For my part, I am very fond of the one, and I dislike the  other; but both of them open up two great new roads in art, and both are  placed like two gigantic arches on the triumphal way of the revolution  that Berlioz started. I will return to the subject of these works later.    But Berlioz was already getting old. His daily cares and stormy domestic  life,[61] his disappointments and passions, his commonplace and often  degrading work, soon wore him out and, finally, exhausted his power.  \"Would you believe it?\" he wrote to his friend Ferrand, \"that which used  to stir me to transports of musical passion now fills me with  indifference, or even disdain. I feel as if I were descending a mountain  at a great rate. Life is so short; I notice that thoughts of the end  have been with me for some time past.\" In 1848, at forty-five years old,  he wrote in his _Memoires_: \"I find myself so old and tired and lacking  inspiration.\" At forty-five years old, Wagner had patiently worked out  his theories and was feeling his power; at forty-five he was writing  _Tristan_ and _The Music of the Future_. Abused by critics, unknown to  the public, \"he remained calm, in the belief that he would be master of  the musical world in fifty years' time.\"[62]    [Footnote 61: He left Henrietta Smithson in 1842; she died in 1854.]    [Footnote 62: Written by Berlioz himself, in irony, in a letter of  1855.]    Berlioz was disheartened. Life had conquered him. It was not that he had  lost any of his artistic mastery; on the contrary, his compositions  became more and more finished; and nothing in his earlier work attained  the pure beauty of some of the pages of _L'Enfance du Christ_ (1850-4),  or of _Les Troyens_ (1855-63). But he was losing his power; and his  intense feeling, his revolutionary ideas, and his inspiration (which in  his youth had taken the place of the confidence he lacked) were failing  him. He now lived on the past--the _Huit scenes de Faust_ (1828) held  the germs of _La Damnation de Faust_ (1846); since 1833, he had been  thinking of _Beatrice et Benedict_ (1862); the ideas in _Les Troyens_  were inspired by his childish worship of Virgil, and had been with him  all his life. But with what difficulty he now finished his task! He had  only taken seven months to write _Romeo_, and \"on account of not being  able to write the _Requiem_ fast enough, he had adopted a kind of  musical shorthand\";[63] but he took seven or eight years to write _Les  Troyens_, alternating between moods of enthusiasm and disgust, and  feeling indifference and doubt about his work. He groped his way  hesitatingly and unsteadily; he hardly understood what he was doing. He  admired the more mediocre pages of his work: the scene of the Laocoon,  the finale of the last act of the _Les Troyens a Troie_, the last scene  with Aeneas in _Les Troyens a Carthage_.[64] The empty pomposities of  Spontini mingle with the loftiest conceptions. One might say that his  genius became a stranger to him: it was the mechanical work of an  unconscious force, like \"stalactites in a dripping grotto.\" He had no  impetus. It was only a matter of time before the roof of the grotto  would give way. One is struck with the mournful despair with which he  works; it is his last will and testament that he is making. And when he  has finished it, he will have finished everything. His work is ended; if  he lived another hundred years he would not have the heart to add  anything more to it. The only thing that remains--and it is what he is  about to do--is to wrap himself in silence and die.    [Footnote 63: _Memoires_, I, 307.]    [Footnote 64: About this time he wrote to Liszt regarding _L'Enfance du  Christ_: \"I think I have hit upon something good in Herod's scena and  air with the soothsayers; it is full of character, and will, I hope,  please you. There are, perhaps, more graceful and pleasing things, but  with the exception of the Bethlehem duet, I do not think they have the  same quality of originality\" (17 December, 1854).]    Oh, mournful destiny! There are great men who have outlived their  genius; but with Berlioz genius outlived desire. His genius was still  there; one feels it in the sublime pages of the third act of _Les  Troyens a Carthage_. But Berlioz had ceased to believe in his power; he  had lost faith in everything. His genius was dying for want of  nourishment; it was a flame above an empty tomb. At the same hour of his  old age the soul of Wagner sustained its glorious flight; and, having  conquered everything, it achieved a supreme victory in renouncing  everything for its faith. And the divine songs of Parsifal resounded as  in a splendid temple, and replied to the cries of the suffering Amfortas  by the blessed words: \"_Selig in Glauben! Selig in Liebe_!\"          II      Berlioz's work did not spread itself evenly over his life; it was  accomplished in a few years. It was not like the course of a great  river, as with Wagner and Beethoven; it was a burst of genius, whose  flames lit up the whole sky for a little while, and then died gradually  down.[65] Let me try to tell you about this wonderful blaze.    Some of Berlioz's musical qualities are so striking that it is  unnecessary to dwell upon them here. His instrumental colouring, so  intoxicating and exciting,[66] his extraordinary discoveries concerning  timbre, his inventions of new nuances (as in the famous combining of  flutes and trombones in the _Hostias et preces_ of the _Requiem_, and  the curious use of the harmonics of violins and harps), and his huge and  nebulous orchestra--all this lends itself to the most subtle expression  of thought.[67]    [Footnote 65: In 1830, old Rouget de Lisle called Berlioz, \"a volcano in  eruption\" (_Memoires_, I, 158).]    [Footnote 66: M. Camille Saint-Saens wrote in his _Portraits et  Souvenirs_, 1900: \"Whoever reads Berlioz's scores before hearing them  played can have no real idea of their effect. The instruments appear to  be arranged in defiance of all common sense; and it would seem, to use  professional slang, that _cela ne dut pas sonner_, but _cela sonne_  wonderfully. If we find here and there obscurities of style, they do not  appear in the orchestra; light streams into it and plays there as in the  facets of a diamond.\"]    [Footnote 67: See the excellent essay of H. Lavoix, in his _Histoire de  l'Instrumentation_. It should be noticed that Berlioz's observations in  his _Traite d'instrumentation et d'orchestration modernes_ (1844) have  not been lost upon Richard Strauss, who has just published a German  edition of the work, and some of whose most famous orchestral effects  are realisations of Berlioz's ideas.]    Think of the effect that such works must have produced at that period.  Berlioz was the first to be astonished when he heard them for the first  time. At the _Ouverture des Francs-Juges_ he wept and tore his hair, and  fell sobbing on the kettledrums. At the performance of his _Tuba mirum_,  in Berlin, he nearly fainted. The composer who most nearly approached  him was Weber, and, as we have already seen, Berlioz only knew him late  in life. But how much less rich and complex is Weber's music, in spite  of its nervous brilliance and dreaming poetry. Above all, Weber is much  more mundane and more of a classicist; he lacks Berlioz's revolutionary  passion and plebeian force; he is less expressive and less grand.    How did Berlioz come to have this genius for orchestration almost from  the very first? He himself says that his two masters at the  Conservatoire taught him nothing in point of instrumentation:--         \"Lesueur had only very limited ideas about the art. Reicha knew the       particular resources of most of the wind instruments; but I think       that he had not very advanced ideas on the subject of grouping       them.\"    Berlioz taught himself. He used to read the score of an opera while it  was being performed.         \"It was thus,\" he says,[68] \"that I began to get familiar with the       use of the orchestra, and to know its expression and timbre, as       well as the range and mechanism of most of the instruments. By       carefully comparing the effect produced with the means used to       produce it, I learned the hidden bond which unites musical       expression to the special art of instrumentation; but no one put me       in the way of this. The study of the methods of the three modern       masters, Beethoven, Weber, and Spontini, the impartial examination       of the traditions of instrumentation and of little-used forms and       combinations, conversations with virtuosi, and the effects I made       them try on their different instruments, together with a little       instinct, did the rest for me.\"[69]    [Footnote 68: One may judge of this instinct by one fact: he wrote the  overtures of _Les Francs-Juges_ and _Waverley_ without really knowing if  it were possible to play them. \"I was so ignorant,\" he says, \"of the  mechanism of certain instruments, that after having written the solo in  D flat for the trombone in the Introduction of _Les Francs-Juges_, I  feared it would be terribly difficult to play. So I went, very anxious,  to one of the trombonists of the Opera orchestra. He looked at the  passage and reassured me. 'The key of D flat is,' he said, 'one of the  pleasantest for that instrument; and you can count on a splendid effect  for that passage'\" _(Memoires_, I, 63).]    [Footnote 69: _Memoires_, I, 64.]    That he was an originator in this direction no one doubts. And no one  disputes, as a rule, \"his devilish cleverness,\" as Wagner scornfully  called"]]]
