This is an innovation that cannot  be too strictly reprehended or too soon abolished. Melting ice can but  weaken the quality and flavour of the wine. Those who desire to drink  _wine and water_ can ask for iced water if they choose; but it savours  too much of economy on the part of a host to insinuate the ice inside  the glasses of his guests when the wine could be more effectually iced  outside the bottle.    A silver knife and fork should be placed to each guest at dessert.    It is wise never to partake of any dish without knowing of what  ingredients it is composed. You can always ask the servant who hands  it to you, and you thereby avoid all danger of having to commit the  impoliteness of leaving it, and showing that you do not approve of it.    Never speak while you have anything in your mouth.    Be careful never to taste soups or puddings till you are sure they  are sufficiently cool; as, by disregarding this caution, you may be  compelled to swallow what is dangerously hot, or be driven to the  unpardonable alternative of returning it to your plate.    When eating or drinking, avoid every kind of audible testimony to the  facts.    Finger-glasses, containing water slightly warmed and perfumed, are  placed to each person at dessert. In these you may dip the tips of  your fingers, wiping them afterwards on your table-napkin. If the  finger-glass and doyley are placed on your dessert-plate, you should  immediately remove the doyley to the left of your plate, and place  the finger-glass upon it. By these means you leave the right for the  wine-glasses.    Be careful to know the shapes of the various kinds of wine-glasses  commonly in use, in order that you may never put forward one for  another. High and narrow, and very broad and shallow glasses, are used  for champagne; large, goblet-shaped glasses for burgundy and claret;  ordinary wine-glasses for sherry and madeira; green glasses for hock;  and somewhat large, bell-shaped glasses, for port.    Port, sherry, and madeira, are decanted. Hocks and champagnes appear  in their native bottles. Claret and burgundy are handed round in a  claret-jug.    The servants leave the room when the dessert is on the table.    Coffee and liqueurs should be handed round when the dessert has  been about a quarter of an hour on the table. After this, the ladies  generally retire.    The lady of the house should never send away her plate, or appear to  have done eating, till all her guests have finished.    If you should unfortunately overturn or break anything, do not  apologize for it. You can show your regret in your face, but it is not  well-bred to put it into words.    To abstain from taking the last piece on the dish, or the last glass  of wine in the decanter, only because it is the last, is highly  ill-bred. It implies a fear on your part that the vacancy cannot be  supplied, and almost conveys an affront to your host.    To those ladies who have houses and servants at command, we have one  or two remarks to offer. Every housekeeper should be acquainted with  the routine of a dinner and the etiquette of a dinner-table. No lady  should be utterly dependent on the taste and judgment of her cook.  Though she need not know how to dress a dish, she should be able to  judge of it when served. The mistress of a house, in short, should  be to her cook what a publisher is to his authors--that is to  say, competent to form a judgment upon their works, though himself  incapable of writing even a magazine article.    If you wish to give a good dinner, and do not know in what manner to  set about it, you will do wisely to order it from Birch, Kuehn, or any  other first-rate _restaurateur_. By these means you ensure the best  cookery and a faultless _carte_.    Bear in mind that it is your duty to entertain your friends in the  best manner that your means permit. This is the least you can do to  recompense them for the expenditure of time and money which they incur  in accepting your invitation.    \"To invite a friend to dinner,\" says Brillat Savarin, \"is to become  responsible for his happiness so long as he is under your roof.\"  Again:--\"He who receives friends at his table, without having bestowed  his personal supervision upon the repast placed before them, is  unworthy to have friends.\"    A dinner, to be excellent, need not consist of a great variety of  dishes; but everything should be of the best, and the cookery should  be perfect. That which should be cool should be cool as ice; that  which should be hot should be smoking; the attendance should be  rapid and noiseless; the guests well assorted; the wines of the best  quality; the host attentive and courteous; the room well lighted; and  the time punctual.    Every dinner should begin with soup, be followed by fish, and include  some kind of game. \"The soup is to the dinner,\" we are told by Grisnod  de la Regniere, \"what the portico is to a building, or the overture to  an opera.\"    To this aphorism we may be permitted to add that a _chasse_ of cognac  or curacoa at the close of the dinner is like the epilogue at the end  of a comedy.    Never reprove or give directions to your servants before guests. If a  dish is not placed precisely where you would have wished it to stand,  or the order of a course is reversed, let the error pass unobserved by  yourself, and you may depend that it will be unnoticed by others.    If you are a mother, you will be wise never to let your children make  their appearance at dessert when you entertain friends at dinner.  Children are out of place on these occasions. Your guests only  tolerate them through politeness; their presence interrupts the genial  flow of after-dinner conversation; and you may rely upon it that, with  the exception of yourself, and perhaps your husband, there is not a  person at table who does not wish them in the nursery.    The duties of hostess at a dinner-party are not onerous; but they  demand tact and good breeding, grace of bearing, and self-possession  in no ordinary degree. She does not often carve. She has no active  duties to perform; but she must neglect nothing, forget nothing,  put all her guests at their ease, encourage the timid, draw out the  silent, and pay every possible attention to the requirements of  each and all around her. No accident must ruffle her temper. No  disappointment must embarrass her. She must see her old china broken  without a sigh, and her best glass shattered with a smile. In short,  to quote the language of a clever contemporary, she must have \"the  genius of tact to perceive, and the genius of finesse to execute; ease  and frankness of manner; a knowledge of the world that nothing  can surprise; a calmness of temper that nothing can disturb; and a  kindness of disposition that can never be exhausted.\"           *       *       *       *       *    X.--THE BALL-ROOM.      As the number of guests at a dinner-party is regulated by the size of  the table, so should the number of invitations to a ball be limited by  the proportions of the ball-room. A prudent hostess will always  invite a few more guests than she really desires to entertain, in the  certainty that there will be some deserters when the appointed evening  comes round; but she will at the same time remember that to overcrowd  her room is to spoil the pleasure of those who love dancing, and  that a party of this kind when too numerously attended is as great a  failure as one at which too few are present.    A room which is nearly square, yet a little longer than it is broad,  will be found the most favourable for a ball. It admits of two  quadrille parties, or two round dances, at the same time. In a  perfectly square room this arrangement is not so practicable or  pleasant. A very long and narrow room is obviously of the worst shape  for the purpose of dancing, and is fit only for quadrilles and country  dances.    The top of the ball-room is the part nearest the orchestra. In  a private room, the top is where it would be if the room were a  dining-room. It is generally at the farthest point from the door.  Dancers should be careful to ascertain the top of the room before  taking their places, as the top couples always lead the dances.    A good floor is of the last importance in a ball-room. In a private  house, nothing can be better than a smooth, well-stretched holland,  with the carpet beneath.    Abundance of light and free ventilation are indispensable to the  spirits and comfort of the dancers.    Good music is as necessary to the prosperity of a ball as good wine to  the excellence of a dinner. No hostess should tax her friends for  this part of the entertainment. It is the most injudicious economy  imaginable. Ladies who would prefer to dance are tied to the  pianoforte; and as few amateurs have been trained in the art of  playing dance music with that strict attention to time and accent  which is absolutely necessary to the comfort of the dancers, a  total and general discontent is sure to result. To play dance music  thoroughly well is a branch of the art which requires considerable  practice. It is as different from every other kind of playing as whale  fishing is from fly fishing. Those who give private balls will do well  ever to bear this in mind, and to provide skilled musicians for the  evening. For a small party, a piano and cornopean make a very pleasant  combination. Unless where several instruments are engaged, we do not  recommend the introduction of the violin: although in some respects  the finest of all solo instruments, it is apt to sound thin and shrill  when employed on mere inexpressive dance tunes, and played by a mere  dance player.    Invitations to a ball should be issued in the name of the lady of the  house, and written on small note paper of the best quality.

Having personified Public Spirit, he makes her speak on the  subject in the following manner:--      \"Let by my specious name no tyrants rise,    And cry, while they enslave, they civilize!    Know, Liberty and I are still the same    Congenial--ever mingling flame with flame!    Why must I Afric's sable children see    Vended for slaves, though born by nature free,    The nameless tortures cruel minds invent    Those to subject whom Nature equal meant?    If these you dare (although unjust success    Empow'rs you now unpunish'd to oppress),    Revolving empire you and yours may doom--    (Rome all subdu'd--yet Vandals vanquish'd Rome)    Yes--Empire may revolt--give them the day,    And yoke may yoke, and blood may blood repay.\"    Wallis, in his System of the Laws of Scotland, maintains, that \"neither men  nor governments have a right to sell those of their own species. Men and  their liberty are neither purchaseable nor saleable.\" And, after arguing  the case, he says, \"This is the law of nature, which is obligatory on all  men, at all times, and in all places.--Would not any of us, who should be  snatched by pirates from his native land, think himself cruelly abused, and  at all times entitled to be free? Have not these unfortunate Africans, who  meet with the same cruel fate, the same right? Are they not men as well as  we? And have they not the same sensibility? Let us not therefore defend or  support an usage, which is contrary to all the laws of humanity.\"    In the year 1750 the reverend Griffith Hughes, rector of St. Lucy, in  Barbadoes, published his Natural History of that island. He took an  opportunity, in the course of it, of laying open to the world the miserable  situation of the poor Africans, and the waste of them by hard labour and  other cruel means, and he had the generosity to vindicate their capacities  from the charge, which they who held them in bondage brought against them,  as a justification of their own wickedness in continuing to deprive them of  the rights of men.    Edmund Burke, in his account of the European settlements, (for this work is  usually attributed to him,) complains \"that the Negroes in our colonies  endure a slavery more complete, and attended with far worse circumstances,  than what any people in their condition suffer in any other part of the  world, or have suffered in any other period of time. Proofs of this are not  wanting. The prodigious waste, which we experience in this unhappy part of  our species, is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth.\" And he goes  on to advise the planters for the sake of their own interest to behave like  good men, good masters, and good Christians, and to impose less labour upon  their slaves, and to give them recreation on some of the grand festivals,  and to instruct them in religion, as certain preventives of their decrease.    An anonymous author of a pamphlet, entitled, An Essay in Vindication of the  Continental Colonies of America, seems to have come forward next. Speaking  of slavery there, he says, \"It is shocking to humanity, violative of every  generous sentiment, abhorrent utterly from the Christian religion--There  cannot be a more dangerous maxim than that necessity is a plea for  injustice, for who shall fix the degree of this necessity? What villain so  atrocious, who may not urge this excuse, or, as Milton has happily  expressed it,                            \"And with necessity,    The tyrant's plea, excuse his dev'lish deed?\"    \"That our colonies,\" he continues, \"want people, is a very weak argument  for so inhuman a violation of justice--Shall a civilized, a Christian  nation encourage slavery, because the barbarous, savage, lawless African  hath done it? To what end do we profess a religion whose dictates we so  flagrantly violate? Wherefore have we that pattern of goodness and  humanity, if we refuse to follow it? How long shall we continue a practice  which policy rejects, justice condemns, and piety revolts at?\"    The poet Shenstone, who comes next in order, seems to have written an Elegy  on purpose to stigmatize this trade. Of this elegy I shall copy only the  following parts:      \"See the poor native quit the Libyan shores,    Ah! not in love's delightful fetters bound!    No radiant smile his dying peace restores,    No love, nor fame, nor friendship heals his wound.      \"Let vacant bards display their boasted woes;    Shall I the mockery of grief display?    No; let the muse his piercing pangs disclose,    Who bleeds and weeps his sum of life away!      \"On the wild heath in mournful guise he stood    Ere the shrill boatswain gave the hated sign;    He dropt a tear unseen into the flood,    He stole one secret moment to repine--      \"Why am I ravish'd from my native strand?    What savage race protects this impious gain?    Shall foreign plagues infest this teeming land,    And more than sea-born monsters plough the main?      \"Here the dire locusts' horrid swarms prevail;    Here the blue asps with livid poison swell;    Here the dry dipsa writhes his sinuous mail;    Can we not here secure from envy dwell?      \"When the grim lion urg'd his cruel chase,    When the stern panther sought his midnight prey,    What fate reserv'd me for this Christian race?    O race more polish'd, more severe, than they--      \"Yet shores there are, bless'd shores for us remain,    And favour'd isles, with golden fruitage crown'd,    Where tufted flow'rets paint the verdant plain,    And ev'ry breeze shall med'cine ev'ry wound.\"    In the year 1755, Dr. Hayter, bishop of Norwich, preached a sermon before  the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in which he bore his  testimony against the continuance of this trade.    Dyer, in his poem called The Fleece, expresses his sorrow on account of  this barbarous trade, and looks forward to a day of retributive justice on  account of the introduction of such an evil.    In the year 1760, a pamphlet appeared, entitled, \"Two Dialogues on the  Mantrade, by John Philmore.\" This name is supposed to be an assumed one.  The author, however, discovers himself to have been both an able and a  zealous advocate in favour of the African race.    Malachi Postlethwaite, in his Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce,  proposes a number of queries on the subject of the Slave-trade. I have not  room to insert them at full length. But I shall give the following as the  substance of some of them to the reader: \"Whether this commerce be not the  cause of incessant wars among the Africans--Whether the Africans, if it  were abolished, might not become as ingenious, as humane, as industrious,  and as capable of arts, manufactures, and trades, as even the bulk of  Europeans--Whether, if it were abolished, a much more profitable trade  might not be substituted, and this to the very centre of their extended  country, instead of the trifling portion which now subsists upon their  coasts--And whether the great hindrance to such a new and advantageous  commerce has not wholly proceeded from that unjust, inhuman,  unchristian-like traffic, called the Slave-trade, which is carried on by  the Europeans.\" The public proposal of these and other queries by a man of  so great commercial knowledge as Postlethwaite, and by one who was himself  a member of the African commitee, was of great service in exposing the  impolicy as well as immorality of the Slave-trade.    In the year 1761, Thomas Jeffery published an account of a part of North  America, in which he lays open the miserable state of the slaves in the  West Indies, both as to their clothing, their food, their labour, and their  punishments. But, without going into particulars, the general account he  gives of them is affecting: \"It is impossible,\" he says, \"for a human heart  to reflect upon the slavery of these dregs of mankind, without in some  measure feeling for their misery, which ends but with their lives--Nothing  can be more wretched than the condition of this people.\"    Sterne, in his account of the Negro girl in his Life of Tristram Shandy,  took decidedly the part of the oppressed Africans. The pathetic, witty, and  sentimental manner, in which he handled this subject, occasioned many to  remember it, and procured a certain portion of feeling in their favour.    Rousseau contributed not a little in his day to the same end.    Bishop Warburton preached a sermon in the year 1766, before the Society for  the Propagation of the Gospel, in which he took up the cause of the  miserable Africans, and in which he severely reprobated their oppressors.  The language in this sermon is so striking, that I shall make an extract  from it. \"From the free savages,\" says he, \"I now come to the savages in  bonds. By these I mean the vast multitudes yearly stolen from the opposite  continent, and sacrificed by the colonists to their great idol the god of  gain. But what then, say these sincere worshippers of mammon? They are our  own property which we offer up.--Gracious God! to talk, as of herds of  cattle, of property in rational creatures, creatures endued with all our  faculties, possessing all our qualities but that of colour, our brethren  both by nature and grace, shocks all the feelings of humanity, and the  dictates of common sense! But, alas! what is there, in the infinite abuses  of society, which does not shock them? Yet nothing is more certain in  itself and apparent to all, than that the infamous traffic for slaves  directly infringes both divine and human law. Nature created man free, and  grace invites him to assert his freedom.\"    \"In excuse of this violation it hath been pretended, that though indeed  these miserable outcasts of humanity be torn from their homes and native  country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the happier, and  their condition the more eligible.
