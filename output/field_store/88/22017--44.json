More than this even, he became Osiris.  He  was admitted to the life of the gods.  Of course the ideas of the  existence of the gods were never clear and consistent.  They lived  in secret places, their whole life was mysterious as well as  powerful.  These are the field of knowledge which the Egyptian  mind could not oversee with any satisfaction to itself.  The most  it could do was to formulate the magic words, invoking the names  of the gods and conjuring them by the events in the Osiris myth  to accept this king as Osiris.  The exceptional man, the  super-man, must have an exceptional future life; but to obtain  it, he must have the knowledge of the names and words necessary  to force the powers of the other world.    Thus the idea of an exceptional future life, a heaven, was  brought into the Egyptian conception of life after death.  Admission to it depended on the exceptional position on earth of  those admitted.  As even this exceptional position was only of  avail when combined with the knowledge of certain formulas, it is  not difficult to see how the knowledge of these formulas might be  considered sufficient to obtain the better future life, even for  others than the king.  When in the depression that followed the  extravagance of the pyramid age the central monarchy lost its  power, Egypt broke up into a series of tribal baronies (nomes).  In each was a ruler almost independent of the king, a man who  might presume with the proper knowledge to claim a glorified  future life similar to that of the king.  And, indeed, we find  from the burial inscriptions of the Middle Empire that such was  the result.  Feudalism extended the possibilities of heaven to the  great nobles.  In the New Empire, the royal power was gradually  absorbed by the priestly organization of the national religion--  the religion of Amon-Ra; and the principle comes into practice  that any priest having the necessary knowledge could obtain for  himself an exceptional place in the future life.  The Osirian  burial customs spread even among the people.  The swathed body  extended on the back becomes universal, even though true  mummification was still only for the rich.    In the Ptolemaic period, the preparation of all the apparatus of  the Osiris burial was divided up into trades.  Factories, one may  say, turned out mummy cases of various kinds, with a scale of  prices to fit every purse.  Other factories turned out amulets and  charms.  Magical texts, the preparation of the body, the  construction of the grave--all things were done by regular  crafts.  The cheapening of the apparatus is most striking.  At the  same time all but the poorest burials bear direct evidence of  their character as Osiris burials.    On the side of the moral requirement we must not look too  closely.  There were powerful words which could compel even the  great judges of the dead to return a favorable verdict.  There  were magic hearts of stone which might be worn in place of the  heart, and, laid in the scales by Anubis, weigh heavier than the  truth.  One might by words compel Anubis to accept this stone  heart instead of the real heart.    In general, one may say that the hope of immortality had little  influence on the moral life of the ordinary Egyptian.  The moral  code was simple and sound and not greatly different from other  primitive codes,--forbidding all those things which the body of  men regard as unpleasant in others, commanding the plain virtues  which were found pleasant in others.  Here, again, I think we may  well look to modern Egypt for a picture of ancient Egypt.  We must  not exaggerate the influence of the belief in immortality on  general morality.  We must not think too well of the life of the  people--nor, on the other hand, too evil.  They had their sins  and their virtues.  The common herd was driven by necessity and  lived as it could.  They clung to the belief in a life in the  grave.  The greater people had leisure to learn and to provide the  magic necessary to secure a comfortable future life.  They loved  life and hated death.    Thus it was when the priests of the Osiris-Isis religion made  their bid to the classical world.  They offered immortality by  initiation.  Learn the proper rites, learn the master words, and  secure eternal life among the great gods.  It was a religion for  the exceptional man down to the last; it required training and  knowledge.  Even in its most popular form in the Ptolemaic period,  a specially instructed class was required, who sold for money the  benefits of their knowledge, and men took rank in their security  of future life according to their means.    Not until Christianity came, offering eternal life free and  without price, did the common people find at last a road open to  equal immortality with the great men of the earth."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#7)"],[1,"Savoy's dragoons poured in upon us at our breaking into  the wood made terrible work among our horses.    For my part I was got into the wood, but was forced to quit my horse,  and by that means, with a great deal of difficulty, got a little  farther in, where there was a little open place, and being quite spent  with labouring among the bushes I sat down resolving to take my fate  there, let it be what it would, for I was not able to go any farther.  I had twenty or thirty more in the same condition come to me in less  than half-an-hour, and here we waited very securely the success of the  battle, which was as before.    It was no small relief to those with me to hear the Savoyards were  beaten, for otherwise they had all been lost; as for me, I confess,  I was glad as it was because of the danger, but otherwise I cared not  much which had the better, for I designed no service among them.    One kindness it did me, that I began to consider what I had to do  here, and as I could give but a very slender account of myself for  what it was I run all these risks, so I resolved they should fight it  among themselves, for I would come among them no more.    The captain with whom, as I noted above, I had contracted some  acquaintance in this regiment, was killed in this action, and the  French had really a great blow here, though they took care to conceal  it all they could; and I cannot, without smiling, read some of the  histories and memoirs of this action, which they are not ashamed to  call a victory.    We marched on to Saluzzo, and the next day the Duke of Savoy presented  himself in battalia on the other side of a small river, giving us a  fair challenge to pass and engage him. We always said in our camp that  the orders were to fight the Duke of Savoy wherever we met him; but  though he braved us in our view we did not care to engage him, but we  brought Saluzzo to surrender upon articles, which the duke could not  relieve without attacking our camp, which he did not care to do.    The next morning we had news of the surrender of Mantua to the  Imperial army. We heard of it first from the Duke of Savoy's cannon,  which he fired by way of rejoicing, and which seemed to make him  amends for the loss of Saluzzo.    As this was a mortification to the French, so it quite damped the  success of the campaign, for the Duke de Montmorency imagining that  the Imperial general would send immediate assistance to the Marquis  Spinola, who besieged Casale, they called frequent councils of war  what course to take, and at last resolved to halt in Piedmont. A few  days after their resolutions were changed again by the news of the  death of the Duke of Savoy, Charles Emanuel, who died, as some say,  agitated with the extremes of joy and grief.    This put our generals upon considering again whether they should march  to the relief of Casale, but the chimera of the Germans put them by,  and so they took up quarters in Piedmont. They took several small  places from the Duke of Savoy, making advantage of the consternation  the duke's subjects were in on the death of their prince, and spread  themselves from the seaside to the banks of the Po. But here an enemy  did that for them which the Savoyards could not, for the plague got  into their quarters and destroyed abundance of people, both of the  army and of the country.    I thought then it was time for me to be gone, for I had no manner of  courage for that risk; and I think verily I was more afraid of being  taken sick in a strange country than ever I was of being killed in  battle. Upon this resolution I procured a pass to go for Genoa, and  accordingly began my journey, but was arrested at Villa Franca by a  slow lingering fever, which held me about five days, and then turned  to a burning malignancy, and at last to the plague. My friend, the  captain, never left me night nor day; and though for four days more I  knew nobody, nor was capable of so much as thinking of myself, yet it  pleased God that the distemper gathered in my neck, swelled and broke.  During the swelling I was raging mad with the violence of pain, which  being so near my head swelled that also in proportion, that my eyes  were swelled up, and for the twenty-four hours my tongue and mouth;  then, as my servant told me, all the physicians gave me over, as past  all remedy, but by the good providence of God the swelling broke.    The prodigious collection of matter which this swelling discharged  gave me immediate relief, and I became sensible in less than an hour's  time; and in two hours or thereabouts fell into a little slumber which  recovered my spirits and sensibly revived me. Here I lay by it till  the middle of September. My captain fell sick after me, but recovered  quickly. His man had the plague, and died in two days; my man held it  out well.    About the middle of September we heard of a truce concluded between  all parties, and being unwilling to winter at Villa Franca, I got  passes, and though we were both but weak, we began to travel in  litters for Milan.    And here I experienced the truth of an old English proverb, that  standers-by see more than the gamesters.    The French, Savoyards, and Spaniards made this peace or truce all for  separate and several grounds, and every one were mistaken.    The French yielded to it because they had given over the relief of  Casale, and were very much afraid it would fall into the hands of the  Marquis Spinola. The Savoyards yielded to it because they were afraid  the French would winter in Piedmont; the Spaniards yielded to it  because the Duke of Savoy being dead, and the Count de Colalto, the  Imperial general, giving no assistance, and his army weakened by  sickness and the fatigues of the siege, he foresaw he should never  take the town, and wanted but to come off with honour.    The French were mistaken, because really Spinola was so weak that had  they marched on into Montferrat the Spaniards must have raised the  siege; the Duke of Savoy was mistaken, because the plague had so  weakened the French that they durst not have stayed to winter in  Piedmont; and Spinola was mistaken, for though he was very slow, if he  had stayed before the town one fortnight longer, Thoiras the governor  must have surrendered, being brought to the last extremity.    Of all these mistakes the French had the advantage, for Casale, was  relieved, the army had time to be recruited, and the French had the  best of it by an early campaign.    I passed through Montferrat in my way to Milan just as the truce was  declared, and saw the miserable remains of the Spanish army, who by  sickness, fatigue, hard duty, the sallies of the garrison and such  like consequences, were reduced to less than 2000 men, and of them  above 1000 lay wounded and sick in the camp.    Here were several regiments which I saw drawn out to their arms that  could not make up above seventy or eighty men, officers and all, and  those half starved with hunger, almost naked, and in a lamentable  condition. From thence I went into the town, and there things were  still in a worse condition, the houses beaten down, the walls and  works ruined, the garrison, by continual duty, reduced from 4500 men  to less than 800, without clothes, money, or provisions, the brave  governor weak with continual fatigue, and the whole face of things in  a miserable case.    The French generals had just sent them 30,000 crowns for present  supply, which heartened them a little, but had not the truce been made  as it was, they must have surrendered upon what terms the Spaniards  had pleased to make them.    Never were two armies in such fear of one another with so little  cause; the Spaniards afraid of the French whom the plague had  devoured, and the French afraid of the Spaniards whom the siege had  almost ruined.    The grief of this mistake, together with the sense of his master,  the Spaniards, leaving him without supplies to complete the siege of  Casale, so affected the Marquis Spinola, that he died for grief, and  in him fell the last of that rare breed of Low Country soldiers, who  gave the world so great and just a character of the Spanish infantry,  as the best soldiers of the world; a character which we see them so  very much degenerated from since, that they hardly deserve the name of  soldiers.    I tarried at Milan the rest of the winter, both for the recovery of my  health, and also for supplies from England.    Here it was I first heard the name of Gustavus Adolphus, the king of  Sweden, who now began his war with the emperor; and while the king  of France was at Lyons, the league with Sweden was made, in which the  French contributed 1,200,000 crowns in money, and 600,000 per annum  to the attempt of Gustavus Adolphus. About this time he landed in  Pomerania, took the towns of Stettin and Stralsund, and from thence  proceeded in that prodigious manner of which I shall have occasion to  be very particular in the prosecution of these Memoirs.    I had indeed no thoughts of seeing that king or his armies. I had  been so roughly handled already, that I had given over the thoughts  of appearing among the fighting people, and resolved in the spring  to pursue my journey to Venice, and so for the rest of Italy. Yet  I cannot deny that as every Gazette gave us some accounts of the  conquests and victories of this glorious prince, it prepossessed my  thoughts with secret wishes of seeing him, but these were so young  and unsettled, that I drew no resolutions from them for a long while  after.    About the middle of January I left Milan and came to Genoa, from  thence by sea to Leghorn, then to Naples, Rome, and Venice, but saw  nothing in Italy that gave me any diversion.    As for what is modern, I saw nothing but lewdness, private murders,  stabbing men at the corner of a street, or in the dark, hiring of  bravos, and the like. These were to me the modern excellencies of  Italy; and I had no gust to antiquities.  "]]]
