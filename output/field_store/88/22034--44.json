British consumption of tea.             1819--24,093,619 lbs.           1827--27,841,284                 ----------    Increase      3,747,665 lbs.        _Consumption of Sugar_.--      In France each individual, annually 5 lbs.    Hamburgh          do.     do.      10    Germany           do. throughout    6    United States     do.     do.       8    Ireland           do.     do.       3    Great Britain     do.     do.      14    Fourteen pounds of sugar per annum, will afford but little more than _half  an ounce_ a day to each individual; a quantity, which it is well known the  youngest child will consume, and yet a large portion of the sugar entered  for home consumption, is used in breweries, and distilleries, so that it  is even doubtful, whether the personal direct consumption of tea or sugar  be the greatest; notwithstanding the latter may be had in such great  abundance and in every country within the tropics.    _Price of Tea in China_.--Bohea, which cannot be purchased in China at  less than _eight-pence half-penny_, may be obtained at Antwerp for  7-3/4_d_.; in France for 6-1/2_d_.; and at Hamburg for 5_d_.! Congou, of  which the Canton price is from 11_d_. to 1_s_. per lb., may be bought in  France at 10-1/2_d_., and at Hamburg from 8-1/4_d_. to 10-1/4_d_.! Canton  price for Hyson, 1_s_. 9-3/4_d_.; French price 1_s_. 8-1/2_d_. Young Hyson  costs in Canton about 1_s_. 8-1/2_d_. per lb., and _only one half that sum  at Hamburg!!_ The Chinese cannot afford to sell Twankay at less than 11_d_.  per lb.; but the American speculators enable the good people of Hamburg to  drink it at _seven-pence farthing!_ Souchong, a good quality tea, sells at  Hamburg for _five-pence_ per lb., which is the _same price_ as the vilest  Bohea costs in the Hamburg market, and is only _one-half the price of  Bohea_ in Canton.    _Cost of a pound of Seven Shilling Tea_.--Take a pound of Congou for  instance, according to the evidence of Mr. Mills, a tea broker, before the  House of Lords:      One pound of good Congou,    _put up_ at the East India    Company's sales at --------------- 1  8    Buyers purposely and for    their own advantage raise it ----- 0  9                                       ----             Purchasing price by the Brokers --- 2  5    Duty levied by the Crown ----------------- 2  5    Retailer's profit, brokerage, &c. -------- 2  2                                               ----                                Shop price     7  0    Thus it will be seen, the tea that the Company offers for sale to the  consumer at 1_s_. 8_d_., or at the utmost say 2_s_., is enhanced to 7_s_.  before it finds its way to the drinker's breakfast table.    _Coffee-Shops_.--There are 3,000 coffee shops in London, in which are  daily consumed 2,000 lbs. of tea and 15,000 lbs. of coffee. The  consumption of _coffee_ in these establishments has increased as  follows:--In 1829, 1,978,600 lbs. In 1830, 2,251,300 lbs. In 1831,  2,899,870. Of tea the increase has only been, during the same periods,  239,700 lbs.--249,400 lbs.--263,000 lbs.          [3] A celebrated Hungarian, named Cosmoes de Koeroes, has lately          discovered in a Thibetian monastery, where he has been engaged          translating an Encyclopaedia, that _lithography_ and _movable          wooden types_ were known to the Chinese many centuries ago.        [4] A Chinese who leaves his country is considered as a traitor,          and is punished with death if he ever return to it.        [5] The grand maxim of Confucius is, \"to despise foreign          commodities.\"        [6] The Chinese use this stimulant as we do wine and spirits, and          with perhaps, less deleterious consequences to their health,          and less evil results to their morals.        [7] About 7,000,000 of which, or bars or moulds of silver to that          amount, are sent to India, the Chinese being unable to make          sufficient return in merchandise. This remittance is of          material assistance in helping to provide funds on the spot          for the purchase of tea.        [8] A late No. of the _Canton Register_, mentions a fact, which is          one instance out of many, of the desire to be independent of          foreigners; it is as follows:--\"Prussian blue, an article          which was formerly brought in _considerable quantities from          England_, is now _totally shut out_ from the list of imports,          in consequence of its mode of manufacture being _acquired by a          Chinaman in London_; and from timely improvement it has been          brought to that perfection which renders the _consumers          independent of foreign supply!\"_        [9] The port dues on a vessel of 1,000 or of 100 tons are _alike!_        [10] The Chinese will not admit a foreign nation to trade at two          places; for instance, the Russians are excluded from Canton          because they enjoy an overland trade at Kiachia, which is 4,          311 miles from St. Petersburgh, and 1,014 miles distant from          Pekin.           *       *       *       *       *      FOX-HUNTING.      The following are the items of expenses, laid down by Colonel Cooke, in  his \"Observations on Fox-hunting,\" published a few years since. The  calculation supposes a four-times-a-week country; but it is generally  below the mark; we should say, at least one-half:--      Fourteen horses ................................. L700    Hounds' food, for fifty couples .................. 275    Firing ............................................ 50    Taxes ............................................ 120    Two whippers-in, and feeder ...................... 210    Earth stopping .................................... 80    Saddlery ......................................... 100    Farriery, shoeing, and medicine .................. 100    Young hounds purchased, and expenses at walks..... 100    Casualties ....................................... 200    Huntsman's wages and his horses .................. 300                                                     -----                                                     L2235    Of course, countries vary much in expense from local circumstance; such as  the necessity for change of kennels, hounds sleeping out, &c. &c. In those  which are called hollow countries, consequently abounding in earths, the  expense of earth-stopping often amounts to 200_l_. per annum, and  Northamptonshire is of this class. In others, a great part of the foxes  are what is termed stub-bred (bred above ground), which circumstance  reduces the amount of this item.--_Quarterly Review._           *       *       *       *       *          THE GATHERER.      Curious Epitaph._--In Nichols's _History of Leicestershire_, is inserted  the following epitaph, to the memory of Theophilus Cave, who was buried in  the chancel of the church of Barrow on Soar:      \"Here in this Grave there lies a Cave;    We call a Cave a Grave;    If Cave be Grave, and Grave be Cave,    Then reader, judge, I crave,    Whether doth Cave here lye in Grave,    Or Grave here lye in Cave:    If Grave in Cave here bury'd lye,    Then Grave, where is thy victory?    Goe, reader, and report here lyes a Cave    Who conquers death, and buryes his own Cave.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *    _Equality._--All men would necessarily have been equal, had they been  without wants; it is the misery attached to our species, which places one  man in subjection to another: Inequality is not the real grievance, but  dependence. It is of little consequence for one man to be called his  highness, and another his holiness; but it is hard for one to be the  servant of another.--_Voltaire._           *       *       *       *       *    The famous Duke of Cumberland showed more cleverness as a boy, than he  ever did as a general. Having displeased his mother one day, she sent him  to his chamber, and when he appeared again, she asked him what he had been  doing. \"Reading,\" replied the boy.--\"Reading what?\"--\"The  Scriptures.\"--\"What part of the Scriptures?\"--\"That part where it is  written, 'Woman! what hast thou to do with me?'\" After the loss of a  battle, an English prisoner observing to a French officer, that they might  have taken the duke himself prisoner; \"Yes,\" replied the Frenchman, \"but  we took care not to do that--he is of far more use to us at the head of  your army.\"--_Georgian Era._           *       *       *       *       *    _The letter Y._--Pythagoras used the Y as a symbol of human life.  \"Remember (says he) that the paths of virtue and of vice resemble the  letter Y. The foot representing infancy, and the forked top the two paths  of vice and virtue, one or the other of which people are to enter upon,  after attaining to the age of discretion.\"    P.T.W.           *       *       *       *       *    _Royal Combat._--Near the city of Gloucester, on the Severn, the river  dividing, forms a small island called _Alney_, which is famous for a royal  combat fought on it, between Edmund Ironside and Canute the Dane, to  decide the fate of the kingdom, in sight of both their armies. Canute was  wounded, when he proposed an amicable division, and accordingly he  obtained the northern part; the southern falling to Edmund.

Volume 19, No. 542, April (#7)"],[1,"or halcyon,) is fabled to sleep in the air,  never to touch the earth; and to kill one is reckoned supremely unlucky.  There is an Indian bird, the name of which has unfortunately escaped us,  that is feigned to live only on the rain-drops which it can draw with its  bill from the clouds; in a dry season, therefore, this bird perishes. Of  the _Bird of Paradise_ the following wonders were once credited: viz. that  the egg was laid in the air by the female, and there hatched by the male  in an orifice of his body; that it had no legs (these however are long,  and a disfigurement to the body, which the Indians know, and fearful of  their depreciating the value of the bird, upon capturing it, cut them off);  that it hung itself by the two long feathers of its tail on a tree when  sleeping; that it never touched the ground during any period of its  existence, and fed wholly on dew. The Indians also believe that the leader,  or king of the birds of paradise is black, with red spots, and that he  soars far away from the rest of the flock, which, however, never quit him,  but settle where he does. The _Gigantic Crane_ is believed by the Indians  to be invulnerable, and animated by the souls of deceased Brahmins; the  Africans hold it in equal veneration. Whence arises the classical fable  that swans sing their own dirge just previous to death, and expire singing  it? The wild swan certainly may be said to whistle, but the tame has no  other note than a hiss, and this only when provoked. The Kamschatdales and  Kuriles wear round their necks the bills of _Puffins_, as an amulet which  ensures good fortune. Who was _Mother Carey_?--The wife, perhaps, of  \"_Davy_,\" and keeper of his \"locker;\" Mother Carey's chickens is the  well-known appellation, in _tarrish_ tongue, of _Stormy Petrels_, not  superstitiously supposed to forebode tempests, since they seem their very  element; but it is probable that to Mother Carey herself (we crave her  pardon--_Mistress_) some astounding \"yarn\" is attached. The _Stork_, the  _Crane_, and the _Pelican_, are each the subject of idle stories; the  latter has been asserted to feed her young with her own bosom's blood, and  to fill her pouch with water in order to supply them in the desert. A  notion is entertained by the ignorant that the _Bittern_ thrusts its bill  into a reed, which serves as a pipe to increase the volume of its natural  note, and swell it above pitch; and in some places a tradition prevails  that it thrusts its head into water and then blows with all its might. It  is erroneous that the _Ostrich_ lays her eggs in the sand, depending  solely on the sun's rays to hatch them; the truth is that, as from the  heat of her native climate, it is not always necessary for her to sit upon  them, she simply does what numerous birds in colder latitudes are well  known to do; viz. cover them, that they may not, during her absence, lose  their heat.    The popular opinion that the _Turtle Dove_, of either sex, should it  happen to lose its mate, remains ever after in a state of disconsolate  celibacy, is, we believe, disproved by the fact, at least as respects  these birds in a wild state; but we may remark, that the loss of a  companion to more than one kind of _domesticated_ bird, if it has been  brought up with one, even though not in the same cage, is sometimes so  severely deplored by the survivor, as to occasion its death, if the loss  be not speedily supplied. The old story of _Swallows_ passing the winter  in a state of torpidity at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and ponds, has  been frequently agitated, asserted to be a fact by one party, and totally  disproved by the other. The reader may be amused to learn, that very  recently we were assured by one, who _knew it for an absolute fact_, that  ducks and even chickens (!!!) had been found in a certain farmer's pond,  laid up in winter quarters, which were revived by the warmth of the sun  and upper air, upon being fished out of it!! \"Regarding _Birds' Eggs_,\"  says the Naturalist in his interesting Journal, \"we have a very foolish  superstition here (Gloucestershire:) the boys may take them unrestrained,  but their mothers so dislike their being kept in the house, that they  usually break them; their presence may be tolerated for a few days, but by  the ensuing Sunday they are frequently destroyed, under the idea that they  bring bad luck, or prevent the coming of good fortune, as if in some way  offensive to the domestic deity of the hearth.\"    Here, then, we pause; some abler hand may, perhaps, be tempted to take up  the subject as we leave it, for there are yet gleanings, in the field, of  \"Superstitions and Fables connected with animals,\" over which our leisure  has allowed us but lightly to pass; gleanings sufficient to reward the  industrious and the curious; or, it may even be, that we shall return,  some day, to this topic ourselves, time and materials permitting.    _Great Marlow, Bucks_.

His  majesty consented, and the whole court were accordingly assembled in the  balconies of the palace, at the Rio, for the purpose of witnessing the  spectacle. By some mishap, of very frequent occurrence in the early  history of these missiles, at the moment of firing the tube veered round,  and the rocket, instead of flying over to Praia Grande, took the opposite  direction, and fell and exploded in the great square, almost beneath the  windows of the palace. The consternation of the king was only equalled by  the mortification of the admiral, who immediately despatched an officer on  shore to explain the cause of the _contretemps_ to his majesty; and  offering to let off another, but the terrified monarch would not hear of  it. \"I have a great respect,\" said he, \"for my good allies, the English,  but after dinner they are absolutely fit for nothing;\" an observation  which clearly indicated to what cause his majesty attributed the  unfortunate result of the exhibition.--_Monthly Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *    _Prosperity of America_.--The United States of N. America posses an almost  undefinable extent of fertile uncultivated land--a highly industrious and  intelligent population of 13,000,000--the national debt will be paid this  year--and they have a large surplus revenue. That of 1831 was 27,700,000  Spanish dollars; the expenditure for all government purposes 14,700,000.           *       *       *       *       *    _War._--Were the disputes between great and rival nations to be settled by  single combat, by those, through whose ambition, pride, or other cause,  they were occasioned, millions of lives might have been saved.           *       *       *       *       *    _Curious Custom._--There is held in Italy, a kind of feast, or ceremony,  in the courts of certain princes, on St. Nicholas's Day, in which people  hide presents in the shoes or slippers of those they would do honour to;  in such a manner as to surprise them on the morrow, when they come to  dress. It is done in imitation of the practice of St. Nicholas; who used,  in the night time, to throw purses of money in at the windows, for  portions to poor maidens on their marriage.

The Romans also borrowed this invention from the  Etruscans, to whom also Greece was indebted for many of its ceremonies and  religious institutions, as well as for its mechanics and artificers.           *       *       *       *       *    It is customary in the canton Wallis, Switzerland, for those who have  found anything lost, even money, to affix it to a large crucifix in the  churchyard, and there is not an example on record, of any object being  taken away except by the rightful owner. W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *    _Cumberland Titles._--The honorary titles arising from the different  degrees of allowed consequence or property in Cumberland, appear (says  Britton) singular when compared with their usual acceptation in society.  The mistress of the house is a _Dame_; every owner of a little landed  property is a _'Statesman_; his eldest son is the _Laird_; and where there  is no son, the eldest daughter is born to the title of _Leady_. Thus we  may see a '_Statesman_ driving the plough, a _Lord_ attending the market  with vegetables, and a _Leady_ labouring at the churn.
