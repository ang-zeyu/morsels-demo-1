You must acquire great power from the worship of the Mother.     Ganesh, the god who grants success, has his seat assigned     to him on the left of the great Mother. Why should you     despair of obtaining success? Look at Kartiki, the god     who is the chief commander of the armies of the gods, who     has stationed himself to the right of the Mother; he is     coming forward with his bow, to assist you against the demons     of sin, who stand in the way of your accomplishing that great     object, and as he is up in arms, who can resist?    The _Khulnavasi_ breaks out into poetry:--       For what sins, O Mother Durga, are thy sons thus dispirited     and their hearts crushed with injustice? The demons     are in the ascendant, and constantly triumphing over godliness.     Awake, Oh Mother, who tramplest on the demons!     Thy helpless sons, lean for want of food, worn out in the     struggle with the demons, are, struck with terror at the way     in which they are being ruled. Famine and plague and     disease are rife, and unrighteousness triumphs. Awake, Oh     Goddess Durga! I see the lightning flashing from the     point of thy bow, the world quaking at thy frowns, and     creation trembling under thy tread. Let a river of blood     flow, overwhelming the hearts of the demons.    The _Kalyani_ chides the Hindus for breaking their _Swadeshi_ vows to  Durga:--       You have made all sorts of vows to stick to Swadeshi,     but you are still using _bilati_ [foreign] salt, sugar, and     cloths which are polluted with the blood and fat of animals.     You swear by the Mother, and then you go and disobey her     and defile her temples. Do you know that it is owing to your     sins that Mother Durga has not come to accept your worship     in Bengal this year? In fact, she is heaving deep sighs of     sorrow--sighs which will bring a cataclysmic storm upon you.     If you still care to save your country from utter ruin, mend     your ways and keep your promises to the Mother.    In other provinces where other deities are more popular it is they who  are similarly called in aid. The _Bedari_ of Lahore, for instance,  reproduces from the Puranas the story of the tyrant Rajah Harnakath, who  brought death on himself at the hands of Vishnu for attempting to kill  his son Prahlad, whose offence was that he believed in God and  championed the cause of justice, in order to liken British statesmen and  Anglo-Indian officials to the wicked Rajah and the Indians to Prahlad.  As most British statesmen and their representatives abroad are the  enemies of liberty and justice and support slavery and oppression, the  fall of Great Britain is near at hand, and India will then pass into the  possession of her own sons.    The _Prem_ of Firozpur is inclined even to give Mr. Keir Hardie a niche  in the Hindu Pantheon. Its editor dreamt he was at a meeting in a free  and contented country. It was attended by some other Indians, and one of  them recited verses bewailing the condition of India, which was once a  heaven on earth and was now converted into a hell by its foreign rulers,  &c. After prayers had been recited for India, some heavenly beings  appeared, one of whom swore to do his best to relieve the sufferings of  Indians. The editor learnt on inquiry that the dream country was  England, the Indian speaker Bepin Chandra Pal, and the heavenly being  Mr. Keir Hardie!    The _Sahaik_, of Lahore, furnishes an apt illustration of the scurrilous  abuse and calumny which constitute one of the favourite weapons of Hindu  writers. Referring to the Malaria Conference held last year, it begins  by remarking that when a famine occurs--       relief works are opened only when the sufferings of the famine-stricken     become acute, and their supervision is entrusted     to a fat-salaried Englishman who swallows up half the collections,     which amount could have fed hundreds of the poor     people. Thus also with the forthcoming inquiries concerning     malarial fever, which is spreading all over the country.     Every Indian knows that, like the plague, this form of fever     is due to the poverty and consequent physical weakness     of the people. It is, however, to the mosquito that the     authorities went for the causes of the disease, just as to     the rats for the causes of plague. Different medicines     and instruments were invented for extirpating the insect,     doctors were also employed, and rewards paid for the writing     of books. In this way crores of rupees went into the pockets     of English shopkeepers and others. A trial is now being     given to quinine, and lakhs-worth sold to Indians, English     quinine manufacturers being thus enriched. Again a commission     is about to sit on the heights of Simla. The commissioners     will enjoy feasts and dances and drink brandy which     will cost poor natives lakhs of rupees, and afterwards they     will devise means to develop the trade in quinine or other     drugs.    The Ranjpur _Vartabaha_ writes that in the local charitable dispensary a  surgical operation was performed on a patient who died in two hours, and  that a similar operation on a pregnant woman resulted in her death. It  adds, with delicate sarcasm, that \"the Chief Medical Officer should get  his salary increased.\" The idea that Englishmen deliberately want to  depopulate India is one that is sedulously propagated. Thus the _Jhang  Sial_ jeers at British \"generosity\" which has \"converted India, one of  the richest countries in the world, into the land of the starving,\" and  British \"wisdom\" for wishing to \"starve out the natives and reign over  empty brick and mortar buildings.\"    The _Akash_ (Delhi), referring to the pension granted to the widow of  Sir W. Curzon Wyllie, asks whether \"the English can hold up their heads  after this. Even their widows are fed by India. A nation whose widows  are fed by another should never boast that it is an Imperial and  self-respecting nation.\"    In the same spirit another Punjab paper argues ironically from the  speech of a Mahomedan member of the Punjab Legislative Council in  condemnation of Dhingra that \"all the white-skinned Europeans, including  the English rulers of India, must be the lowest born people in the  world, seeing that they are in the habit of killing natives every day.\"    No public servants who venture to discharge their duty loyally fare  worse at the hands of the Nationalist Press than Judges--especially if  they are Indians. Mr. Justice Davar was the Parsee Judge who sentenced  Tilak. The _Kesari_ declared that \"he had already settled the sentence  in his own mind after a careful consideration of external  circumstances,\" and \"had made himself the laughing-stock of the whole  world, like the meddlesome monkey in the fable who came to grief in  trying to pull out the peg 'from a half-sawed beam,'\" Now the _Kesari_  was Tilak's own paper, and he was convicted on two seditious articles  that had appeared in its columns, but the _Kal_, another Poona sheet,  also maintained that everything was done on a prearranged plan. \"There  is no sense in saying that Mr. Tilak was sentenced according to law.  There was mockery of justice, not justice.\" It added that \"if the Hindus  are to suppose Mr. Tilak guilty because an English Court of Justice had  condemned him, Christians will have to forswear Christ because He was  crucified by a Roman Court.\" The _Karnatak Vaibhau_ recalled the story  of the notorious washerman who, by scandalizing Rama, had been  immortalized in the Ramayana. In the same way the names of Strachey--who  sentenced Tilak at his first trial in 1897--and Davar would be  remembered as long as history endured.    Quotations could be multiplied _ad infinitum_ and _ad nauseam_ from the  same papers--I have given only one from each--and from scores of others.  These will suffice to show what the freedom of the Press stood for in  India, in a country where there is an almost superstitious reverence  for, and faith in, the printed word, where the influence of the Press is  in proportion to the ignorance of the vast majority of its readers, and  where, unfortunately the more violent and scurrilous a newspaper  becomes, the more its popularity grows among the very classes that boast  of their education. They are by no means obscure papers, and some of  them, such as the _Kal_ the _Hind Swarajya_, and especially the  _Yugantar,_ which became at one time a real power in Bengal, achieved a  circulation hitherto unknown to the Indian Press. Can any Englishman,  however fervent his faith in liberty, regret that some at least of these  papers have now disappeared either as the result of prosecutions under  the Indian Criminal Code or from the operation of the new Press Law? The  mischief they have done still lives and will not be easily eradicated.  It is the fashion in certain quarters to reply:--\"But look at the  Anglo-Indian newspapers, at the aggressive and contemptuous tone they  assume towards the natives of India, at the encouragement they  constantly give to racial hatred.\" Though I am not concerned to deny  that, in the columns of a few English organs, there may be occasional  lapses from good taste and right feeling, such sweeping charges against  the Anglo-Indian Press as a whole are absolutely grotesque, and its most  malevolent critics would be at a loss to quote anything, however  remotely, resembling the exhortations to hatred and violence which have  been the stock-in-trade not only of the most popular newspapers in the  vernaculars, but of some even of the leading newspapers published in  English, but edited and owned by Indians.    Even such extracts as I have given above from vernacular newspapers do  not by any means represent the lengths to which Indian \"extremism\" can  go.

Gallet wrote a sonnet in Alexandrine verse for Sabatino's  declaration of his love. I was unable to set this to music, for the  twelve feet embarrassed me and prevented my getting into my stride. As I  did not know what else to do, I took the sonnet and by main force  reduced the verse to ten feet with a caesura at the fifth foot. I took  this to my dear collaborator in fear and trembling, and, as I had  feared, he at once fell into the depths of despair.    \"That was the best thing in my work,\" he said. \"I nursed and caressed  that sonnet, and now you have ruined it.\"    In the face of this despair, I screwed up my courage. As I had  previously cut down the verse, I now tried lengthening out the music.  Then, I sang both versions to the disconsolate poet.    And what a miracle! He was altogether reconciled, approved both  versions, and did not know which one to choose. We ended with a  patchwork. The two quatrains are in verses of ten feet, and the two  tiercets in Alexandrine metre.    Outside of our work, too, our relations were delightful. We wrote to  each other constantly in both prose and verse; we bombarded each other  with sonnets; his letters were sometimes ornamented with water colors,  for he drew very well and one of his joys was to cover white paper with  color. Gallet drew the sketches for the desert in _Le Roi de Lahore_ and  the cloister in _Proserpine_.    When Madame Adam founded the _Nouvelle Revue_ she offered me the  position of musical critic, which I did not think I ought to accept. She  did not know where to turn. \"Take Gallet,\" I advised her. \"He is an  accomplished man of letters. He is not a musician in the sense that he  has studied music, but he has the soul of a musician, which is worth  much more.\" Madame Adam followed my advice and found it good.    At this period, under the guise of Wagnerism, the wildest theories and  the most extravagant assertions were current in musical criticism.  Gallet was naturally well poised and independent and he did not do as  the rest did. Instead he opposed them, but from unwillingness to give  needless offense he displayed marked tact and discretion in his  criticisms. This did him no good, however, for it aroused no sentiment  of gratitude, and without giving him credit for a literary style that  was rare among librettists, his contemporaries received each of his  works with a hostility entirely devoid of either justice or mercy.  Gallet felt this hostility keenly. He felt that he did not deserve it,  since he took so much care in his work and put so much courtesy into his  criticism. The blank verse he used in _Thais_ with admirable regard for  color and harmony, counting on the music to take the place of the rhyme,  was not appreciated. This verse was free from assonance and the  banalities which it draws into operatic works, but it kept the rhythm  and sonorous sound which is far removed from prose. That was the period  when there was nothing but praise for Alfred Ernst's gibberish, though  that was an insult alike to the French language and the masterpieces he  had the temerity to translate. Gallet used the same blank verse in  _Dejanire_, although its use here was more debatable, but he handled it  with surprising skill. Now that this text has been set to music, it  shows its full beauty.    Louis Gallet devoted a large part of his time to administrative duties,  for he was successively treasurer and manager of hospitals. Nevertheless  he produced works in abundance. He left a record of no less than forty  operatic librettos, plays, romances, memoirs, pamphlets, and innumerable  articles. I wish I knew what to say about the man himself, his  unwearying goodness, his loyalty, his scrupulousness, his good humor,  his originality, his continual common sense, and his intellect, alert to  everything unusual and interesting.    What good talks we used to have as we dined under an arbor in the large  garden which was his delight at Lariboisiere! I used to take him seeds,  and he made amusing botanical experiments with them.    He was seriously ill at one period of his life. He was wonderfully  nursed by his wife--who was a saint--and he endured prolonged and  atrocious sufferings with the patience of a saint. He watched the growth  of his fatal disease with a stoicism worthy of the sages of antiquity  and he had no illusion about the implacable illness which slowly but  surely would result in his premature death. A constantly increasing  deafness was his greatest trouble. This cruel infirmity had made  frightful progress when, in 1899, the Arenes de Beziers opened its doors  for the second time to _Dejanire_. In spite of everything, including his  ill health which made the trip very painful, he wanted to see his work  once more. He heard nothing, however--neither the artists, the choruses,  nor even the applause of the several thousand spectators who encored it  enthusiastically. A little later he passed on, leaving in his friends'  hearts and at the work-tables of his collaborators a void which it is  impossible to fill.    [Illustration: The First Performance of _Dejanire_ at Les Arenes de  Beziers]          CHAPTER VI    HISTORY AND MYTHOLOGY IN OPERA      Oceans of ink have been spilled in discussing the question of whether  the subjects of operas should be taken from history or mythology, and  the question is still a mooted one. To my mind it would have been better  if the question had never been raised, for it is of little consequence  what the answer is. The only things worth while are whether the music is  good and the work interesting. But _Tannhauser_, _Lohengrin_, _Tristan_  and _Siegfried_ appeared and the question sprang up. The heroes of  mythology, we are told, are invested with a prestige which historical  characters can never have. Their deeds lose significance and in their  place we have their feelings, their emotions, to the great benefit of  the operas. After these works, however, _Hans Sachs_ (Die Meistersinger)  appeared, and although he is not mythical at all he is a fine figure  nevertheless. But in this case the plot is of little account, for the  interest lies mainly in the emotions--the only thing, it appears, which  music with its divine language ought to express.    It is true that music makes it possible to simplify dramatic action and  it gives a chance, as well, for the free expression and play of  sentiments, emotions and passions. In addition, music makes possible  pantomimic scenes which could not be done otherwise, and the music  itself flows more easily under such conditions. But that does not mean  that such conditions are indispensable for music. Music in its  flexibility and adaptability offers inexhaustible resources. Give Mozart  a fairy tale like the _Magic Flute_ or a lively comedy such as _Le Nozze  di Figaro_ and he creates without effort an immortal masterpiece.    It is a question whether there is any essential difference between  history and mythology. History is made up of what probably happened;  mythology of what probably did not happen. There are myths in history  and history in myths. Mythology is merely the old form of history.  Every myth is rooted in truth. And we have to seek for this truth in  the fable, just as we try to reconstruct extinct animals from the  remains Time has preserved to us. Behind the story of Prometheus we see  the invention of fire; behind the loves of Ceres and Triptolemus the  invention of the plow and the beginnings of agriculture. The adventures  of the Argonauts show us the first attempts at voyages of exploration  and the discovery of gold mines. Volumes have been written about the  truths behind the fables, and explanations have been found for the  strangest facts of mythology, even for the metamorphoses which Ovid  described so poetically.    Halfway between history and mythology come the sacred writings. Each  race has its own. Ours are the Old and New Testament. Many believe that  these books are myths; a larger number--the Believers--that they are  history, Sacred History, the only true history--the only one about which  it is not permitted to express a doubt. If you want a proof of this,  recall that not so many years ago a clergyman in the Church of England  was censured by his ecclesiastical superiors for daring to say in a  sermon that the Serpent in the Garden of Eden was symbolical and not a  real creature.    And the ecclesiastical authorities were right. The basis of Christianity  is the Redemption--the incarnation and sacrifice of God himself to blot  out the stain of the first great sin and also to open the Kingdom of  Heaven to men. That original sin was Adam's fall, when he followed the  example of Eve, a victim of the Serpent's treacherous counsels, and  disobeyed the command not to taste the Forbidden Fruit. Eliminate the  Garden of Eden, the Serpent, the Forbidden Fruit, and the entire fabric  of Christianity crumbles.    If we turn to profane history and take any historical work, we find that  the facts are told in such a way that they seem to us beyond dispute.  But if we see the same facts from the pen of another historian, we no  longer recognize them. The reason is that a writer almost never  undertakes the task of wrestling with the giant, History, unless he is  impelled to do so by a preconceived idea, by a general conception, or a  system he wants to establish. And whether he wants to or not, he sees  the facts in a light favorable to his preconceived idea, and observes  them through prisms which increase or diminish their importance at his  will. Then, however great his discernment and however strong his desire  to reach the truth, it is doubtful if he ever will. In history, as  elsewhere, absolute truth escapes mankind. Louis XIV, Louis XV, Madame  de Maintenon, Madame de Pompadour, Louis XVI, even Napoleon and  Josephine, so near our own times, are already quasi-mythical characters.  The Louis XIII of"]]]
