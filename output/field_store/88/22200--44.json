A huge mass of heavy jet-black smoke gradually rose  till it towered high above the cliffs on the European and Asiatic sides.  It ballooned slowly out like a gigantic genie rising from a fisherman's  bottle.    By now the action was slackening, and at 3:45 five ships were slowly  steaming homeward from the entrance. At 4:30 there were still eight  vessels in the strait, but the forts had practically ceased to fire. The  action was over for the day.    The result had been the apparent silencing of several Turkish batteries,  and those terrific explosions at the forts at Chanak and Kilid Bahr, the  ultimate effect of which remains to be seen when the attack is renewed  tonight. For Chanak is burning.          Official Story of Two Sea Fights    [From The London Times, March 3, 1915.]      _Admiralty, March 3, 1915._    _The following dispatch has been received from Vice Admiral Sir David  Beatty, K.C.B., M.V.O., D.S.O., commanding the First Battle Cruiser  Squadron, reporting the action in the North Sea on Sunday, the 24th of  January, 1915:_    H.M.S. Princess Royal,  Feb. 2, 1915.    Sir: I have the honor to report that at daybreak on Jan. 24, 1915, the  following vessels were patrolling in company:    The battle cruisers Lion, Capt. Alfred E.M. Chatfield, C.V.O., flying my  flag; Princess Royal, Capt. Osmond de B. Brock, Aide de Camp; Tiger,  Capt. Henry B. Pelly, M.V.O.; New Zealand, Capt. Lionel Halsey, C.M.G.,  Aide de Camp, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Sir Archibald Moore,  K.C.B., C.V.O., and Indomitable, Capt. Francis W. Kennedy.    The light cruisers Southampton, flying the broad pennant of Commodore  William E. Goodenough, M.V.O.; Nottingham, Capt. Charles B. Miller;  Birmingham, Capt. Arthur A.M. Duff, and Lowestoft, Capt. Theobald W.B.  Kennedy, were disposed on my port beam.    Commodore (T) Reginald Y. Tyrwhitt, C.B., in Arethusa, Aurora, Capt.  Wilmot S. Nicholson; Undaunted, Capt. Francis G. St. John, M.V.O.;  Arethusa and the destroyer flotillas were ahead.    At 7:25 A.M. the flash of guns was observed south-southeast. Shortly  afterward a report reached me from Aurora that she was engaged with  enemy's ships. I immediately altered course to south-southeast,  increased to 22 knots, and ordered the light cruisers and flotillas to  chase south-southeast to get in touch and report movements of enemy.    This order was acted upon with great promptitude, indeed my wishes had  already been forestalled by the respective senior officers, and reports  almost immediately followed from Southampton, Arethusa, and Aurora as to  the position and composition of the enemy, which consisted of three  battle cruisers and Bluecher, six light cruisers, and a number of  destroyers, steering northwest. The enemy had altered course to  southeast. From now onward the light cruisers maintained touch with the  enemy, and kept me fully informed as to their movements.    The battle cruisers worked up to full speed, steering to the southward.  The wind at the time was northeast, light, with extreme visibility. At  7:30 A.M. the enemy were sighted on the port bow steaming fast, steering  approximately southeast, distant 14 miles.    Owing to the prompt reports received we had attained our position on the  quarter of the enemy, and so altered course to southeast parallel to  them, and settled down to a long stern chase, gradually increasing our  speed until we reached 28.5 knots. Great credit is due to the engineer  staffs of New Zealand and Indomitable--these ships greatly exceeded  their normal speed.    At 8:52 A.M., as we had closed to within 20,000 yards of the rear ship,  the battle cruisers manoeuvred to keep on a line of bearing so that guns  would bear, and Lion fired a single shot, which fell short. The enemy at  this time were in single line ahead, with light cruisers ahead and a  large number of destroyers on their starboard beam.    Single shots were fired at intervals to test the range, and at 9:09 A.M.  Lion made her first hit on the Bluecher, No. 4 in the line. The Tiger  opened fire at 9:20 A.M. on the rear ship, the Lion shifted to No. 3 in  the line, at 18,000 yards, this ship being hit by several salvos. The  enemy returned our fire at 9:14 A.M. Princess Royal, on coming into  range, opened fire on Bluecher, the range of the leading ship being  17,500 yards, at 9:35 A.M. New Zealand was within range of Bluecher,  which had dropped somewhat astern, and opened fire on her. Princess  Royal shifted to the third ship in the line, inflicting considerable  damage on her.    Our flotilla cruisers and destroyers had gradually dropped from a  position broad on our beam to our port quarter, so as not to foul our  range with their smoke; but the enemy's destroyers threatening attack,  the Meteor and M Division passed ahead of us, Capt. the Hon. H. Meade,  D.S.O., handling this division with conspicuous ability.    About 9:45 A.M. the situation was as follows: Bluecher, the fourth in  their line, already showed signs of having suffered severely from gun  fire; their leading ship and No. 3 were also on fire, Lion was engaging  No. 1, Princess Royal No. 3, New Zealand No. 4, while the Tiger, which  was second in our line, fired first at their No. 1, and when interfered  with by smoke, at their No. 4.    The enemy's destroyers emitted vast columns of smoke to screen their  battle cruisers, and under cover of this the latter now appeared to have  altered course to the northward to increase their distance, and  certainly the rear ships hauled out on the port quarter of their leader,  thereby increasing their distance from our line. The battle cruisers,  therefore, were ordered to form a line of bearing north-northwest, and  proceed at their utmost speed.    Their destroyers then showed evident signs of an attempt to attack. Lion  and Tiger opened fire on them, and caused them to retire and resume  their original course.    The light cruisers maintained an excellent position on the port quarter  of the enemy's line, enabling them to observe and keep touch, or attack  any vessel that might fall out of the line.    At 10:48 A.M. the Bluecher, which had dropped considerably astern of  enemy's line, hauled out to port, steering north with a heavy list, on  fire, and apparently in a defeated condition. I consequently ordered  Indomitable to attack enemy breaking northward.    At 10:54 A.M. submarines were reported on the starboard bow, and I  personally observed the wash of a periscope two points on our starboard  bow. I immediately turned to port.    At 11:03 A.M. an injury to the Lion being reported as incapable of  immediate repair, I directed Lion to shape course northwest. At 11:20  A.M. I called the Attack alongside, shifting my flag to her at about  11:35 A.M. I proceeded at utmost speed to rejoin the squadron, and met  them at noon retiring north-northwest.    I boarded and hoisted my flag on Princess Royal at about 12:20 P.M.,  when Capt. Brock acquainted me of what had occurred since the Lion fell  out of the line, namely, that Bluecher had been sunk and that the enemy  battle cruisers had continued their course to the eastward in a  considerably damaged condition. He also informed me that a Zeppelin and  a seaplane had endeavored to drop bombs on the vessels which went to the  rescue of the survivors of Bluecher.    The good seamanship of Lieut. Commander Cyril Callaghan, H.M.S. Attack,  in placing his vessel alongside the Lion and subsequently the Princess  Royal, enabled the transfer of flag to be made in the shortest possible  time.    At 2 P.M. I closed Lion and received a report that the starboard engine  was giving trouble owing to priming, and at 3:38 P.M. I ordered  Indomitable to take her in tow, which was accomplished by 5 P.M.    The greatest credit is due to the Captains of Indomitable and Lion for  the seaman-like manner in which the Lion was taken in tow under  difficult circumstances.    The excellent steaming of the ships engaged in the operation was a  conspicuous feature.    I attach an appendix giving the names of various officers and men who  specially distinguished themselves.    Where all did well it is difficult to single out officers and men for  special mention, and as Lion and Tiger were the only ships hit by the  enemy, the majority of these I mention belong to those ships.    I have the honor to be, Sir,    Your obedient servant,    (Signed) DAVID BEATTY,  Vice Admiral.      OFFICERS.    Commander Charles A. Fountaine, H.M.S. Lion.    Lieut. Commander Evan C.

Miss Helen Smith appealed to me  to save her. I placed her in a boat and saw her safely away. I got into  one of the last boats to leave.    \"Some of the boats could not be launched, as the vessel was sinking.  There was a large number of women and children in the second cabin.  Forty of the children were less than a year old.\"    From interviews with passengers it appears that when the torpedoes burst  they sent forth suffocating fumes, which had their effect on the  passengers, causing some of them to lose consciousness.    Two stokers, Byrne and Hussey of Liverpool, gave a few details. They  said the submarine gave no notice and fired two torpedoes, one hitting  No. 1 stoke hole and the second the engine room. The first torpedo was  discharged at 2 o'clock. In twenty-five minutes the great liner  disappeared.    The Cunard Line agent states that the total number of persons aboard the  Lusitania was 2,160.      MR. KESSLER'S DESCRIPTION.    [Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]    _LONDON, Monday, May 10.--Survivors of the Lusitania arriving in London  yesterday from Queenstown told some of their tragic experiences to_ THE  NEW YORK TIMES _correspondent._    _They forcibly expressed the opinion that the Lusitania was badly  handled in being run into waters where it was known submarines were  waiting. Although not for a moment attempting to shift the blame from  the \"murderous Germans\" for the sinking of a ship full of innocent  passengers, they insisted that the officers of the steamship, knowing  that submarines were lurking off the Irish coast, ought to have taken a  different path to avoid all danger...._    _George A. Kessler of New York, in an interview, gave the following  description of the Lusitania sinking and of preliminary incidents  aboard:_    \"On Wednesday I saw the crew taking tarpaulins from the boats, and I  went up to the Purser and said:    \"'It's all right drilling your crew, but why don't you drill your  passengers?'    \"The Purser said he thought it was a good idea, and added, 'Why not tell  Captain Turner, Sir?'    \"The next day I had a conversation with the Captain, and to him  suggested that the passengers should receive tickets, each with a number  denoting the number of the boat he should make for in case anything  untoward happened. I added that this detail would minimize difficulties  in the event of trouble.    \"The Captain replied that this suggestion was made after the disaster to  the Titanic. The Cunard people had thought it over and considered it  impracticable. He added that, of course, he could not act on the advice  given, because he should first have the authority of the Board of Trade.    \"I talked with the Captain generally about the torpedo scare, which  neither of us regarded as of any moment. The Captain (you understand, of  course, that we were smoking and chatting) explained his plans to me. He  said that they were then slowing down, (in fact, we were going only  about eighteen knots,) and that the ship would be slowed down until they  got somewhere further on the voyage, and then they would go at all speed  and get over the war zone.    \"I asked him what the war zone was, and he said 500 miles from  Liverpool.    \"According to the next day's run, ending about two hours before the  mishap occurred, we were about 380 or 390 miles from Liverpool. So we  were in the war zone, and we were going only at a speed of eighteen  knots at the critical moment.    \"For the two days previous, as well as I remember, the mileage was 506  and 501, and on Thursday the mileage was 488. On Friday I was playing  bridge when the pool was put up on the day's run and I heard twenty  numbers go from 480 to 499. I thought it would be a grand speculation to  buy the lowest number, as we were going so slow. I did buy it, and paid  $100. The amount in the pool was between $300 and $350, and when the  pool was declared, I was the winner.    \"The steward offered to hand over the money if I would go to his cabin,  but I said that he could pay me later.    \"Shortly after the steward had left me I was on the upper deck and  looking out to sea. I saw all at once the wash of a torpedo, indicated  by a snake-like churn of the surface of the water. It may have been  about thirty feet away. And then came a thud.\"    _Mr. Kessler told of the general rush for the deck and the second  explosion. Then he continued:_    \"Mr. Berth and his wife, from New York, first-class passengers, were the  last ones I spoke to. I should say that all the passengers in the dining  saloon had come up on deck. The upper deck was crowded, and, of course,  the passengers were wondering what was the matter, few really believing  what it proved to be. Still they began to lower boats, and then things  began to happen very quickly.    \"Mr. Berth was trying to persuade his wife to get into a boat. She said  she would not do so without him. He said, 'Oh, come along, my darling; I  will be all right,' and I added to his persuasions.    \"I saw him help her into the boat with the ropes of the davits. I fell  into the same boat, and we were slipped down into the water over the  side of the liner, which was bulging out, the list being the other way.  The boat struck the water, and after some seconds (it may have been a  minute) I looked up and cried out, 'My God, the Lusitania is gone!'    \"We saw the entire bulk, which had been almost upright just a few  seconds before, suddenly lurch over away from us. Then she seemed to  stand upright in the water, and the next instant the keel of the vessel  caught the keel of the boat in which we were floating, and we were  thrown into the water. There were only about thirty people in the boat,  and I should say that all were stokers or third-class passengers. There  may have been one or two first class; I cannot recall who they were.    \"When the boat was overturned I sank fifteen or twenty feet. I thought I  was gone. However, I had my lifebelt around me, and managed to rise  again to the surface. There I floated for possibly ten or fifteen  minutes, when I saw and made a grab at a collapsible lifeboat at which  other passengers were also grabbing. We managed to get it shipshape and  clamber in. There were eight or nine in the boat, all stokers except one  or two third-class passengers.    \"It was partly filled with water and in the scramble which occurred the  boat was overturned, and once more we were pitched into the water. This  occurred, I should say, eight times, the boat usually righting itself.  Before we were picked up by the Bluebell six of the party of eight or  nine were lying drowned in the bilge water which was in the bottom.\"    _When asked what he thought the effect of the sinking would be on the  United States, Mr. Kessler answered:_    \"My God! what can America do? Nothing will bring back these people to  life.    \"It was cold-blooded, deliberate murder, and nothing else--the greatest  murder the world has ever known. How will going to war mend that?\"    _To the question whether the loss of the liner could have been avoided,  Mr. Kessler said slowly:_    \"That is a very serious question, and I hesitate to give an opinion on  matters which are purely technical.    \"Still, it seems to me as a landsman, and one who has crossed the ocean  a great many times, that the safety of the Lusitania lay in speed. We  were in the war zone by 140 or 150 miles, and every moment that we  dawdled at fifteen or eighteen knots was an increase of our risk of  being torpedoed.    \"Again, (and of course I merely make the comment,) I cannot understand  why there were no destroyers or patrol boats about, as we certainly had  been led to expect there would be when we reached the war zone.    \"The ship was torpedoed at 2:05 P.M. My watch stopped at 2:30. It was 5  o'clock when I was picked up by the Bluebell, and it was 10 o'clock  before we were landed in Queenstown.\"      CHARLES FROHMAN'S DEATH.    [Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.]    _LONDON, May 10.--A highly interesting story was told tonight by Rita  Jolivet, the actress, who stood calmly chatting with Charles Frohman and  Alfred G. Vanderbilt during the last tense moments before the Lusitania  sank. The three of them, together with G.L.S. Vernon, Miss Jolivet's  brother-in-law, and Mr. Scott, who had come all the way from Japan to  enlist, joined hands and stood waiting to face death together. Miss  Jolivet said:_    We stood talking about the Germans and the rumor which had gained  currency that a man, obviously of German origin, had been arrested for  tampering with the wireless. The story was that the man had been  discovered at 1 o'clock in the morning a day or two before doing  something to the wireless apparatus and had been immediately imprisoned.  I did not see the man arrested, so I am not sure about the story's  truth, but there were good grounds for believing it.    We determined not to enter the boats, and just a minute or two before  the end Mr. Frohman said with a smile: \"Why fear death? It is the most  beautiful adventure that life gives us.\"    Mr. Scott fetched three lifebelts, one for Mr. Vanderbilt, one for Mr.  Frohman, and one for my brother-in-law. He said he was not going to wear  one himself, and my brother-in-law also refused to put his on. I hear  that Mr. Vanderbilt gave his to a lady, Mrs. Scott. I helped to put a  lifebelt on Mr. Frohman. My brother-in-law took hold of my hand and I  grasped the hand of Mr. Frohman, who, as you know, was lame. Mr. Scott  took hold of his other hand, and Mr. Vanderbilt joined the row, too. We  had made up our minds to die together.    Then Mr. Frohman, in a perfectly calm voice, said: \"They've done for us;  we had better get out.\" He knew that his beautiful adventure was about  to begin. He had hardly spoken when, with a tremendous roar, a great  wave swept along the deck and we were all divided in a moment. I have  not seen any of those brave men "]]]
