Besides, she had all these other Admirers set  out as Decoys to prove that if he didn't, somebody else might.    The Treasurer of the Shoe Factory got a large Rally on himself, and she  had to Give In and make a Promise.    He loves to tell Callers how he proposed to his Wife in the Kitchen, and  he doesn't know to this Day that she was Expecting it.    MORAL: _As soon as he begins to Frequent the Back Rooms of the House,  measure him for the Harness_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ MAN-GRABBER WHO WENT OUT _OF_ HIS CLASS      While standing in front of his Store, between two Dummies in Seersucker  Suits, one of the Chosen People spotted a Good Thing that resembled a  Three-Sheet of the Old Homestead. It was looking up at the Top Stories  and bumping against Hydrants and Unsurpassed Coffee Bulletins. The flip  Yahooda, with the City Education and Thirty Centuries of Commercial  Training to back him up, saw that here was a Chance to work off some Old  Stock. So when the mild old Gentleman with the strawcolored Sluggers and  the Freckles on his Wrists came near enough, he Closed with him and told  him to come inside and look at a New Style called the McKinley Overcoat  because the President had one just like it.    Uncle Eck replied that he did not really need an Overcoat, as he had  traded for one only a few Seasons before, but he was willing to go in  and Look Around, and if he did not buy anything he reckoned there  wouldn't be any Hard Feelings. Accordingly he walked straight into the  Trap and permitted Mr. Zangwill to show him an Assortment of Shoddy  Garments fastened together with Mucilage. The Crafty Merchant came down  from $38 to $6.50, and showed him a Confidential Letter from his Cousin  Sig to prove that the Goods had been Smuggled in, but old Peaceful  Valley refused to Bite. He allowed the Proprietor to talk himself out,  and then he walked up and down the Counters, careless-like, to see what  was on the Shelves, and he did some quiet Figuring in a Memorandum Book  such as they give away at Drug Stores. Before he left he had Traded 20  Acres of flinty Hillside in New Hampshire for the Clothing Store, the  Mortgage on the Land to be Assumed by the New Owner, and he had $75 to  Boot and an Agreement in Writing.    [Illustration: THE TRAPPER]    The Hauler-In is now Clerking and trying to Hold Out enough to give him  another Start.    MORAL: _Lower Broadway is not New England_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ INVETERATE JOKER WHO REMAINED _IN_ MONTANA      The Subject of this Fable started out in Life as a Town Cut-Up. He had a  keen Appreciation of Fun, and was always playing Jokes. If he wanted a  few Gum-Drops he would go into the Candy Store and get them, and then  ask the Man if he was willing to take Stamps. If the Man said he was,  then the Boy would stamp a couple of times, which meant that the Laugh  was on the Man. It was considered a Great Sell in Those Parts.    Or else he would go into a Grocery with another tricky Tad and get some  Article of Value, and they would pretend to Quarrel as to which should  Pay for it. One would ask the Proprietor if he cared who paid for it,  and if he said he did not, they would up and tell him to Pay for it  Himself. This one was so Cute that they had a little Piece in the Paper  about it.    Or they would go and Purchase a Watermelon to be paid for as soon as a  Bet was decided, and afterward it would Develop that the Bet was whether  the Saw-Mill would fall to the East or the West, in case the Wind blew  it over.    It was Common Talk that the Boy was Sharp as a Tack and Keen as a Brier  and a Natural-Born Humorist.    Once he sold a Calf to the Butcher, several Hours after the Calf had  been struck by Lightning. As for ordering Goods and having them charged  to his Father, that was one of the Slickest Things he ever did.    About the time the Joker was old enough to leave Home, he traveled out  through the Country selling Bulgarian Oats to the Farmers. When the  Contract for the Seed Oats got around to the Bank, it proved to be an  iron-clad and double-riveted Promissory Note. The Farmer always tried to  get out of Paying it, but when the Case came to Trial and the Jurors  heard how the Agent palavered the Hay-Seed they had to Snicker right out  in Court. They always gave Judgment for the Practical Joker, who would  take them out and buy Cigars for them, and they would hit him on the  Back and tell him he was a Case.    One Day the Joker had an Inspiration, and he had to tell it to a Friend,  who also was something of a Wag.    They bought a Cat-Tail Swamp remote from Civilization and divided it  into Building Lots. The Marsh was Advertised as a Manufacturing Suburb,  and they had side-splitting Circulars showing the Opera House, the Drill  Factory, Public Library, and the Congregational Church. Lots were sold  on the Instalment Plan to Widows, Cash-Boys, and Shirt-Factory Girls who  wanted to get Rich in from fifteen to twenty Minutes.    The Joker had a Lump of Bills in every Pocket. If asked how he made his  Roll, he would start to Tell, and then he would Choke Up, he was so full  of Laugh. He certainly had a Sunny Disposition.    [Illustration: MANUFACTURING SUBURB]    Finally he went to the State of Montana. He believed he could have a  Season of Merriment by depositing some Valuable Ore in a Deserted Mine,  and then selling the Mine to Eastern Speculators. While he was Salting  the Mine, pausing once in a while to Control his Mirth, a few Natives  came along, and were Interested. They were a slow and uncouth Lot, with  an atrophied Sense of Humor, and the Prank did not Appeal to them. They  asked the Joker to Explain, and before he could make it Clear to them or  consult his Attorney they had him Suspended from a Derrick. He did not  Hang straight enough to suit, so they brought a Keg of Nails and tied to  his Feet, and then stood off and Shot at the Buttons on the Back of his  Coat.    MORAL: _Don't Carry a Joke too far, and never Carry it into Montana_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ CRUEL INSULT _AND THE_ ARRIVAL _OF THE_ LOVER FROM  NO. 6      One Morning there came into the Dining Room of the Peerless Hotel at  Welby's Junction an English Tourist and the Advance Agent of the Mabel  Mooney Repertoire Company.    They took their Places at the Table underneath a Chromo representing a  Pyramid of Idealized Fruit. The Table was covered with Sail Cloth, and  in the Center was the Corroded Caster, which gave out a Sound similar to  that of the Galloping Horse in the War Drama whenever any one walked  across the Floor.    The English Traveler appeared to have received Bad News from Home, but  he had not. That was the Normal Expression. His Mustache was long and  wilted. Also the Weary Look around the Eyes. He traveled with a Cowhide  Bag that must have used up at least one Cow. The Clothes he wore  evidently had been cut from a Steamer Rug by his Mother, or some other  Aged Relative suffering from Astigmatism. He had been Sleeping in them.    As for the Second Traveler, he was an Advance Agent.    \"Cheer Up,\" said the Advance Agent to the English Tourist. \"It may not  be True, and if it is True it may be for the Best.\"    The English Tourist made no Response, fearing that his Fellow-Traveler  might be In Trade.    [Illustration: TOURIST]    Then the One that waited on the Table did the Glide from behind a  Screen.    She was very Pale, up to a certain Point.    Pausing about six feet from the English Tourist she looked resolutely at  a Knot-Hole in the Floor and said:    \"Beefsteakliverhamand.\"    \"My Good Woman,\" said the Man from Stoke-on-Tritham, just as if he meant  to Prorogue something. \"I should like a Rasher of Bacon, and have it  Jolly Well Done.\"    \"Ain't got no Bacon,\" she replied, feeling of her Brooch.    \"Dyuh-me! Then I should like some Boiled Eggs, and mind that they are  Fresh.\"    \"I'll give you Regular Aigs,\" she said, lifting her Head proudly, for  she was no Serf.    \"Approach me, Kit,\" said the Advance Agent, with gentle Voice.    \"Is tha-a-at so-o-o?\" she asked. \"I'll have you know, Smarty, my name  ain't Kit. So There!\"    \"Well, make it Genevieve,\" said the Advance Agent. \"Come close and hold  my Hand while I give you this Order. And merely as one Friend speaking  to another, I want to tell you that the Blending under the Left Ear is  very poor, and if you are not careful somebody will Sign you as a  Spotted Girl.\"    \"My Mother was a Lady,\" she said.    \"That being the Case, I would like to have you go out and Engage a nice  piece of Liver for me. And if you show yourself to be real Winsome and  Chic I may be able to use you with the Troupe.\"    \"Tea or Coffee?\"    \"Don't tell me which one you bring and see if I can Guess. And I would  like some Actual Potatoes.\"    \"I suppose, Sir, you think I have no Feelings.\"    \"That is none of my Business,\" he replied. \"I am merely passing through  your Beautiful Little City.\"    \"I wish Edmund was here,\" said she.    \"So do I,\" assented the Advance Agent, promptly. \"If he can wait on the  Table I wish he was here. Now see if you can make the Kitchen in two  Jumps.\"    [Illustration: ADVANCE AGENT]    \"He'd show you if you could get Flossy with a Lady, even though she  Works.\"    \"You are about to lose your Tip, standing around here trying to shoot it  back at the Handsome Guest,\" remarked the Advance Agent. \"Has Edmund  about finished his Fall Plowing?\"    \"He don't do no Fall Plowing,\" was the Bitter Reply. \"He Fires on Number  Six.\"    At that Moment there entered a Railroad Boy with Braid on his Clothes  and Coal-Dust on his Neck. He removed the Cap that had rested on his  flanging Ears and sat at the Table with the Advance Agent and the  English Tourist.    \"Feed me Everything, with One in the Light to come along,\" he said. \"If  any of the Cockroaches ask for me, tell them I'm for all Night with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11938"],[0,"Folklore of the Santal Parganas (#7)"],[1,"them up. So she went to the jungle and collected the leaves and then  sat down and cried and sang:--          \"I am to fetch leaves without a rope      I am to fetch leaves without a rope      How far have my brothers gone to trade?\"      and as she cried a _buka sobo_ snake came out and asked why she was  crying, and when she told it, it said that it would coil itself round  the leaves in place of a rope. So it stretched itself out straight  and she piled the leaves on the top of it and the snake coiled itself  tightly round them and so she was able to carry the bundle home on her  head. Her sisters-in-law ran to see how she managed it, but she put  the bundle down gently and the snake slipped away unperceived. Still  they resolved to try again; so the next day they sent her to fetch  a bundle of fire wood, but told her that she was to use no rope to  tie it with. So she went to the jungle and collected the sticks and  then sat down and cried:--          \"I am to bring wood without tying it,      I am to bring wood without tying it,      How far have my brothers gone to trade?\"      and as she cried a python came out and asked what was the matter,  and when it heard, it told her not to cry and said that it would act  as a rope to bind up the sticks; so it stretched itself out and she  laid the sticks on it and then it coiled itself round them and she  carried the bundle home.    As the sisters-in-law had been baffled thus, they resolved on another  plan and proposed that they should all go and gather sticks in the  jungle; and on the way they came to a _machunda_ tree in full flower  and they wanted to pick some of the flowers. The wicked sisters-in-law  at first began to climb the tree, but they pretended that they could  not and kept slipping down; then they hoisted their sister-in-law into  the branches and told her to throw down the flowers to them. But while  she was in the tree, they tied thorns round the trunk so that she could  not descend and then left her to starve. After she had been in the tree  a long time, her brothers passed that way on their return journey,  and sat down under the tree to rest; the girl was too weak to speak  but she cried and her tears fell on the back of her eldest brother,  and he looked up and saw her; then they rescued her and revived her  and listened to her story; and they were very angry and vowed to  have revenge. So they gave their sister some needles and put her in a  sack and put the sack on one of the pack-bullocks. And when they got  home, they took the sack off gently and told their wives to carry it  carefully inside the house, and on no account to put it down. But when  the wives took it up, the girl inside pricked them with the needles so  that they screamed and let the sack fall. Their husbands scolded them  and made them take it up again, and they had to carry it in, though  they were pricked till the blood ran down. Then the brothers enquired  about all that had happened in their absence, and at last asked after  their sister, and their wives said that she had gone to the jungle  with some friends to get firewood. But the brothers turned on them and  told how they had found her in the _machunda_ tree and had brought her  home in the sack, and their wives were dumbfounded. Then the brothers  said that they had made a vow to dig a well and consecrate it; so they  set to work to dig a well two fathoms across and three fathoms deep;  and when they reached water, they fixed a day for the consecration;  and they told their wives to put on their best clothes and do the  _cumaura_ (betrothal) ceremony at the well. So the wives went to the  well, escorted by drummers, and as they stood in a row round the well,  each man pushed his own wife into it and then they covered the well  with a wooden grating and kept them in it for a whole year and at  the end of the year they pulled them out again.                   *       *       *       *       *    Another version of this story gives three other tasks preliminary to  those given above and begins as follows:--    Once upon a time there was a girl named Hira who had seven  brothers. The brothers went away to a far country to trade leaving  her alone in the house with their wives; these seven sisters-in-law  hated Hira and did what they could to torment her; one day they sowed  a basketful of mustard seed in a field and then told her to go and  pick it all up; she went to the field and began to lament, singing:--          \"They have sown a basket of mustard seed!      Oh, how far away have my brothers gone to trade.\"      As she cried a flock of pigeons came rustling down and asked her what  was the matter, and when they heard, they told her to be comforted;  they at once set to work picking up the mustard grain by grain and  putting it into her basket; soon the basket was quite full and she  joyfully took it home and showed it to her sisters-in-law. Then they  set her another task and told her to bring them some bear's hair that  they might weave it into a hair armlet for her wedding. So she went off  to the jungle and sat down to cry; as she wept two bear cubs came up  and asked what was the matter; when she told her story they bade her  be of good cheer and took her into their cave and hid her. Presently  the mother bear came back and suckled her cubs, and when they had  finished they asked their mother to leave them some of her hair that  they might amuse themselves by plaiting it while she was away. She  did so and directly she had gone off to look for food, the cubs gave  the girl the hair and sent her home rejoicing. The sisters-in-law  were only made more angry by her success and plotted how to kill her,  so they ordered her to bring them some tiger's milk that they might  make it into curds for her wedding. Then she went off to the jungle  and began to weep, singing:--          \"I brought the hair of a bear:      How far away have my brothers gone to trade.\"      At the sound two tiger cubs came running up and asked what was the  matter; they told her to be comforted and they would manage to give  her what she wanted; and they took her and hid her near where they  were lying. Presently the tigress came back and suckled her cubs and  as she did so she declared that she smelt a human being, but the  cubs laughed at her and said that it must be they whom she smelt;  so she was satisfied, and as she was leaving them they asked her to  leave some of her milk in an earthern pot so that they might have  something to drink if she were long in coming back. The tigress did  so and directly she was gone the cubs gave the milk to the girl who  took it home.--The story then continues as before.          XI. How to Grow Rich.    Once upon a time there was a woman whose husband died while she was  pregnant, and she was very unhappy and used to pray daily to Singh  Chando to give her a man child in place of her husband; she was left  well off and among her property were three gold coins, and as she was  afraid of these being stolen she decided to place them in the care  of the village headman. So she took them to him and asked him to keep  them till her child was born; and no one was present at the time but  the headman's wife. In due time her child was born and by the mercy  of Singh Chando it was a son; and when the boy had grown a bit and  could run alone his mother decided to take back the gold coins, so she  went to the headman and asked him for them; but he and his wife said:  \"We do not understand what you are talking about? We know of no gold  coins: where are your witnesses? You must have had witnesses in such  a business.\" And they drove her out. She went away crying and called  the villagers together and asked them to decide the matter. So they  questioned her and the headman but as it was word against word they  could come to no decision; so they settled to put the parties on  oath, but the headman and the woman both swore that they had spoken  the truth, saying, \"May we die if we have spoken falsely.\" Then  the villagers made them swear by their children and the woman and  the headman laid their hands on the heads of their sons and swore;  and when the woman swore her son fell down dead and she took up the  dead body in her arms and ran away with it.    The villagers were very sorry for what had happened but the headman  and his wife abused them for not having believed their word. The  woman had not gone very far before she met a stranger who asked why  she was crying and when she told him, he said: \"Do not cry: you told  one falsehood and so your son has died. Take your child back to the  villagers and tell them that it was five gold coins and not three  that you gave to the headman and if you do this the child will come  to life again.\"    So the woman hastened back and found the villagers still assembled  and she told them as the stranger had directed; and she agreed to be  sworn again on the body of the child, and the headman promised to pay  five gold pieces if the child were restored to life. So the woman  laid her hands on the dead child and swore, and it was restored to  life. Then the headman was dumbfounded and reluctantly brought out  five gold pieces and gave them to the woman. She gave five rupees  to the villagers and they made the headman give them ten rupees for  having deceived them, and they bought pigs and had a feast.    In the course of time the boy grew up and his mother urged him to  marry. He asked her if she knew how to choose a wife and also what  sort of cattle to buy, and she said that she did not know; her husband  had not told her this. So the youth said that he would go to Singh  Chando and ask.    His mother washed his clothes for him and gave him food for the  journey and he set out. On the way he met a man who asked him where  he was going and he answered that he was going to make a petition to  Singh Chando. \"Then,\" said the man, \"make a petition for me also. I  have so"]]]
