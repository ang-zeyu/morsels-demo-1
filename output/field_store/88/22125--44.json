[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14080"],[0,"Custom and Myth (#7)"],[1,"the bull-roarer on the soil of ancient  Greece and in connection with the Dionysiac mysteries.  Clemens of  Alexandria, and Arnobius, an early Christian father who follows Clemens,  describe certain toys of the child Dionysus which were used in the  mysteries.  Among these are _turbines_, [Greek], and [Greek].  The  ordinary dictionaries interpret all these as whipping-tops, adding that  [Greek] is sometimes 'a magic wheel.'  The ancient scholiast on Clemens,  however, writes: 'The [Greek] is a little piece of wood, to which a  string is fastened, and in the mysteries it is whirled round to make a  roaring noise.' {39}  Here, in short, we have a brief but complete  description of the bull-roarer of the Australian turndun.  No single  point is omitted.  The [Greek], like the turndun, is a small object of  wood, it is tied to a string, when whirled round it produces a roaring  noise, and it is used at initiations.  This is not the end of the matter.    In the part of the Dionysiac mysteries at which the toys of the child  Dionysus were exhibited, and during which (as it seems) the [Greek], or  bull-roarer, was whirred, the performers daubed themselves all over with  clay.  This we learn from a passage in which Demosthenes describes the  youth of his hated adversary, AEschines.  The mother of AEschines, he  says, was a kind of 'wise woman,' and dabbler in mysteries.  AEschines  used to aid her by bedaubing the initiate over with clay and bran. {40a}  The word [Greek], here used by Demosthenes, is explained by Harpocration  as the ritual term for daubing the initiated.  A story was told, as  usual, to explain this rite.  It was said that, when the Titans attacked  Dionysus and tore him to pieces, they painted themselves first with clay,  or gypsum, that they might not be recognised.  Nonnus shows, in several  places, that down to his time the celebrants of the Bacchic mysteries  retained this dirty trick.  Precisely the same trick prevails in the  mysteries of savage peoples.  Mr. Winwood Reade {40b} reports the  evidence of Mongilomba.  When initiated, Mongilomba was 'severely flogged  in the Fetich House' (as young Spartans were flogged before the animated  image of Artemis), and then he was 'plastered over with goat-dung.'  Among  the natives of Victoria, {40c} the 'body of the initiated is bedaubed  with clay, mud, charcoal powder, and filth of every kind.'  The girls are  plastered with charcoal powder and white clay, answering to the Greek  gypsum.  Similar daubings were performed at the mysteries by the Mandans,  as described by Catlin; and the Zunis made raids on Mr. Cushing's black  paint and Chinese ink for like purposes.  On the Congo, Mr. Johnson found  precisely the same ritual in the initiations.  Here, then, not to  multiply examples, we discover two singular features in common between  Greek and savage mysteries.  Both Greeks and savages employ the  bull-roarer, both bedaub the initiated with dirt or with white paint or  chalk.  As to the meaning of the latter very un-Aryan practice, one has  no idea.  It is only certain that war parties of Australian blacks bedaub  themselves with white clay to alarm their enemies in night attacks.  The  Phocians, according to Herodotus (viii. 27), adopted the same 'aisy  stratagem,' as Captain Costigan has it.  Tellies, the medicine-man  ([Greek]), chalked some sixty Phocians, whom he sent to make a night  attack on the Thessalians.  The sentinels of the latter were seized with  supernatural horror, and fled, 'and after the sentinels went the army.'  In the same way, in a night attack among the Australian Kurnai, {41a}  'they all rapidly painted themselves with pipe-clay: red ochre is no use,  it cannot frighten an enemy.'  If, then, Greeks in the historic period  kept up Australian tactics, it is probable that the ancient mysteries of  Greece might retain the habit of daubing the initiated which occurs in  savage rites.    'Come now,' as Herodotus would say, 'I will show once more that the  mysteries of the Greeks resemble those of Bushmen.'  In Lucian's Treatise  on Dancing, {41b} we read, 'I pass over the fact that you cannot find a  single ancient mystery in which there is not dancing. . . . To prove this  I will not mention the secret acts of worship, on account of the  uninitiated.  But this much all men know, that most people say of those  who reveal the mysteries, that they \"dance them out.\"'  Here Liddell and  Scott write, rather weakly, 'to dance out, let out, betray, probably of  some dance which burlesqued these ceremonies.'  It is extremely  improbable that, in an age when it was still forbidden to reveal the  [Greek], or secret rites, those rites would be mocked in popular  burlesques.  Lucian obviously intends to say that the matter of the  mysteries was set forth in ballets d'action.  Now this is exactly the  case in the surviving mysteries of the Bushmen.  Shortly after the  rebellion of Langalibalele's tribe, Mr. Orpen, the chief magistrate in  St. John's Territory, made the acquaintance of Qing, one of the last of  an all but exterminated tribe.  Qing 'had never seen a white man, except  fighting,' when he became Mr. Orpen's guide.  He gave a good deal of  information about the myths of his people, but refused to answer certain  questions.  'You are now asking the secrets that are not spoken of.'  Mr.  Orpen asked, 'Do you know the secrets?'  Qing replied, 'No, only the  initiated men of that dance know these things.'  To 'dance' this or that  means, 'to be acquainted with this or that mystery;' the dances were  originally taught by Cagn, the mantis, or grasshopper god.  In many  mysteries, Qing, as a young man, was not initiated.  He could not 'dance  them out.' {42}    There are thus undeniably close resemblances between the Greek mysteries  and those of the lowest contemporary races.    As to the bull-roarer, its recurrence among Greeks, Zunis, Kamilaroi,  Maoris, and South African races, would be regarded, by some students, as  a proof that all these tribes had a common origin, or had borrowed the  instrument from each other.  But this theory is quite unnecessary.  The  bull-roarer is a very simple invention.  Anyone might find out that a bit  of sharpened wood, tied to a string, makes, when whirred, a roaring  noise.  Supposing that discovery made, it is soon turned to practical  use.  All tribes have their mysteries.  All want a signal to summon the  right persons together and warn the wrong persons to keep out of the way.  The church bell does as much for us, so did the shaken seistron for the  Egyptians.  People with neither bells nor seistra find the bull-roarer,  with its mysterious sound, serve their turn.  The hiding of the  instrument from women is natural enough.  It merely makes the alarm and  absence of the curious sex doubly sure.  The stories of supernatural  consequences to follow if a woman sees the turndun lend a sanction.  This  is not a random theory, without basis.  In Brazil, the natives have no  bull-roarer, but they have mysteries, and the presence of the women at  the mysteries of the men is a terrible impiety.  To warn away the women,  the Brazilians make loud 'devil-music' on what are called 'jurupari  pipes.'  Now, just as in Australia, _the women may not see the jurupari  pipes on pain of death_.  When the sound of the jurupari pipes is heard,  as when the turndun is heard in Australia, every woman flees and hides  herself.  The women are always executed if they see the pipes.  Mr.  Alfred Wallace bought a pair of these pipes, but he had to embark them at  a distance from the village where they were procured.  The seller was  afraid that some unknown misfortune would occur if the women of his  village set eyes on the juruparis. {44}    The conclusion from all these facts seems obvious.  The bull-roarer is an  instrument easily invented by savages, and easily adopted into the ritual  of savage mysteries.  If we find the bull-roarer used in the mysteries of  the most civilised of ancient peoples, the most probable explanation is,  that the Greeks retained both the mysteries, the bull-roarer, the habit  of bedaubing the initiate, the torturing of boys, the sacred obscenities,  the antics with serpents, the dances, and the like, from the time when  their ancestors were in the savage condition.  That more refined and  religious ideas were afterwards introduced into the mysteries seems  certain, but the rites were, in many cases, simply savage.  Unintelligible  (except as survivals) when found among Hellenes, they become intelligible  enough among savages, because they correspond to the intellectual  condition and magical fancies of the lower barbarism.  The same sort of  comparison, the same kind of explanation, will account, as we shall see,  for the savage myths as well as for the savage customs which survived  among the Greeks.          THE MYTH OF CRONUS.      In a Maori pah, when a little boy behaves rudely to his parents, he is  sometimes warned that he is 'as bad as cruel Tutenganahau.'  If he asks  who Tutenganahau was, he is told the following story:--    'In the beginning, the Heaven, Rangi, and the Earth, Papa, were the  father and mother of all things.  \"In these days the Heaven lay upon the  Earth, and all was darkness.  They had never been separated.\"  Heaven and  Earth had children, who grew up and lived in this thick night, and they  were unhappy because they could not see.  Between the bodies of their  parents they were imprisoned, and there was no light.  The names of the  children were Tumatuenga, Tane Mahuta, Tutenganahau, and some others.  So  they all consulted as to what should be done with their parents, Rangi  and Papa.  \"Shall we slay them, or shall we separate them?\"  \"Go to,\"  said Tumatuenga, \"let us slay them.\"  \"No,\" cried Tane Mahuta, \"let us  rather separate them.  Let one go upwards, and become a stranger to us;  let the other remain below, and be a parent to us.\"  Only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14091"],[0,"Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, (#7)"],[1,"him to any one in whom  he may not place confidence, as he might be a loser by such.
