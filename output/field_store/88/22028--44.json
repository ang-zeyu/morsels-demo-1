[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#7)"],[1,"negroes of this estate several thousand dollars for moss,  which is a very profitable article of traffic with them--they collect it  from the trees, dry and pick it, and then sell it to the people in Darien  for mattresses, sofas, and all sorts of stuffing purposes,--which, in my  opinion, it answers better than any other material whatever that I am  acquainted with, being as light as horse hair, as springy and elastic, and  a great deal less harsh and rigid. It is now bed-time, dear E----, and I  doubt not it has been sleepy time with you over this letter, long ere you  came thus far. There is a preliminary to my repose, however, in this  agreeable residence, which I rather dread, namely, the hunting for, or  discovering without hunting, in fine relief upon the white-washed walls of  my bed-room, a most hideous and detestable species of _reptile_, called  centipedes, which come out of the cracks and crevices of the walls, and  fill my very heart with dismay. They are from an inch to two inches long,  and appear to have not a hundred, but a thousand legs. I cannot ascertain  very certainly from the negroes whether they sting or not, but they look  exceedingly as if they might, and I visit my babies every night, in fear  and tremblings lest I should find one or more of these hateful creatures  mounting guard over them. Good night; you are well to be free from  centipedes--better to be free from slaves.           *       *       *       *       *      Dear E----. This morning I paid my second visit to the infirmary, and  found there had been some faint attempt at sweeping and cleaning, in  compliance with my entreaties. The poor woman Harriet, however, whose  statement, with regard to the impossibility of their attending properly to  their children, had been so vehemently denied by the overseer, was crying  bitterly. I asked her what ailed her, when, more by signs and dumb show  than words, she and old Rose informed me that Mr. O---- had flogged her  that morning, for having told me that the women had not time to keep their  children clean. It is part of the regular duty of every overseer to visit  the infirmary at least once a day, which he generally does in the morning,  and Mr. O----'s visit had preceded mine but a short time only, or I might  have been edified by seeing a man horsewhip a woman. I again and again  made her repeat her story, and she again and again affirmed that she had  been flogged for what she told me, none of the whole company in the room  denying it, or contradicting her. I left the room, because I was so  disgusted and indignant, that I could hardly restrain my feelings, and to  express them could have produced no single good result. In the next ward,  stretched upon the ground, apparently either asleep or so overcome with  sickness as to be incapable of moving, lay an immense woman,--her stature,  as she cumbered the earth, must have been, I should think, five feet seven  or eight, and her bulk enormous. She was wrapped in filthy rags, and lay  with her face on the floor. As I approached, and stooped to see what ailed  her, she suddenly threw out her arms, and, seized with violent  convulsions, rolled over and over upon the floor, beating her head  violently upon the ground, and throwing her enormous limbs about in a  horrible manner. Immediately upon the occurrence of this fit, four or five  women threw themselves literally upon her, and held her down by main  force; they even proceeded to bind her legs and arms together, to prevent  her dashing herself about; but this violent coercion and tight bandaging  seemed to me, in my profound ignorance, more likely to increase her  illness, by impeding her breathing, and the circulation of her blood, and  I bade them desist, and unfasten all the strings and ligatures, not only  that they had put round her limbs, but which, by tightening her clothes  round her body, caused any obstruction. How much I wished that, instead of  music and dancing and such stuff, I had learned something of sickness and  health, of the conditions and liabilities of the human body, that I might  have known how to assist this poor creature, and to direct her ignorant  and helpless nurses! The fit presently subsided, and was succeeded by the  most deplorable prostration and weakness of nerves, the tears streaming  down the poor woman's cheeks in showers, without, however, her uttering a  single word, though she moaned incessantly. After bathing her forehead,  hands, and chest with vinegar, we raised her up, and I sent to the house  for a chair with a back (there was no such thing in the hospital,) and we  contrived to place her in it. I have seldom seen finer women than this  poor creature and her younger sister, an immense strapping lass, called  Chloe--tall, straight, and extremely well made--who was assisting her  sister, and whom I had remarked, for the extreme delight and merriment  which my cleansing propensities seemed to give her, on my last visit to  the hospital. She was here taking care of a sick baby, and helping to  nurse her sister Molly, who, it seems, is subject to those fits, about  which I spoke to our physician here--an intelligent man, residing in  Darien, who visits the estate whenever medical assistance is required. He  seemed to attribute them to nervous disorder, brought on by frequent child  bearing. This woman is young, I suppose at the outside not thirty, and her  sister informed me that she had had ten children--ten children, E----!  Fits and hard labour in the fields, unpaid labour, labour exacted with  stripes--how do you fancy that? I wonder if my mere narration can make  your blood boil, as the facts did mine? Among the patients in this room  was a young girl, apparently from fourteen to fifteen, whose hands and  feet were literally rotting away piecemeal, from the effect of a horrible  disease, to which the negroes are subject here, and I believe in the West  Indies, and when it attacks the joints of the toes and fingers, the pieces  absolutely decay and come off, leaving the limb a maimed and horrible  stump! I believe no cure is known for this disgusting malady, which seems  confined to these poor creatures. Another disease, of which they  complained much, and which, of course, I was utterly incapable of  accounting for, was a species of lock-jaw, to which their babies very  frequently fall victims, in the first or second week after their birth,  refusing the breast, and the mouth gradually losing the power of opening  itself. The horrible diseased state of head, common among their babies, is  a mere result of filth and confinement, and therefore, though I never  anywhere saw such distressing and disgusting objects as some of these poor  little woolly skulls presented, the cause was sufficiently obvious.  Pleurisy, or a tendency to it, seems very common among them; also  peri-pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs, which is terribly prevalent,  and generally fatal. Rheumatism is almost universal; and as it proceeds  from exposure, and want of knowledge and care, attacks indiscriminately  the young and old. A great number of the women are victims to falling of  the womb and weakness in the spine; but these are necessary results of  their laborious existence, and do not belong either to climate or  constitution.    I have ingeniously contrived to introduce bribery, corruption, and  pauperism, all in a breath, upon this island, which, until my advent, was  as innocent of these pollutions, I suppose, as Prospero's isle of refuge.  Wishing, however, to appeal to some perception, perhaps a little less dim  in their minds than the abstract loveliness of cleanliness, I have  proclaimed to all the little baby nurses, that I will give a cent to every  little boy or girl whose baby's face shall be clean, and one to every  individual with clean face and hands of their own. My appeal was fully  comprehended by the majority, it seems, for this morning I was surrounded,  as soon as I came out, by a swarm of children carrying their little  charges on their backs and in their arms, the shining, and, in many  instances, wet faces and hands of the latter, bearing ample testimony to  the ablutions which had been inflicted upon them. How they will curse me  and the copper cause of all their woes, in their baby bosoms! Do you know  that little as grown negroes are admirable for their personal beauty (in  my opinion, at least), the black babies of a year or two old are very  pretty; they have for the most part beautiful eyes and eyelashes, the  pearly perfect teeth, which they retain after their other juvenile graces  have left them; their skins are all (I mean of blacks generally)  infinitely finer and softer than the skins of white people. Perhaps you  are not aware that among the white race the _finest grained_ skins  generally belong to persons of dark complexion. This, as a characteristic  of the black race, I think might be accepted as some compensation for the  coarse woolly hair. The nose and mouth, which are so peculiarly  displeasing in their conformation in the face of a negro man or woman,  being the features least developed in a baby's countenance, do not at  first present the ugliness which they assume as they become more marked;  and when the very unusual operation of washing has been performed, the  blood shines through the fine texture of the skin, giving life and  richness to the dingy colour, and displaying a species of beauty which I  think scarcely any body who observed it would fail to acknowledge. I have  seen many babies on this plantation, who were quite as pretty as white  children, and this very day stooped to kiss a little sleeping creature,  that lay on its mother's knees in the infirmary--as beautiful a specimen  of a sleeping infant as I ever saw. The caress excited the irrepressible  delight of all the women present--poor creatures! who seemed to forget  that I was a woman, and had children myself, and bore a woman's and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12423"],[0,"A Short History of the United States for School Use (#7)"],[1,"[Sidenote: Articles of Confederation, 1643.]    [Sidenote: New England towns. _Higginson_, 47-79.]    55. The New England Confederation, 1643.--Besides the settlements  that have already been described there were colonists living in New  Hampshire and in Maine. Massachusetts included the New Hampshire towns  within her government, for some of those towns were within her limits.  In 1640 the Long Parliament met in England, and in 1645 Oliver Cromwell  and the Puritans destroyed the royal army in the battle of Naseby. In  these troubled times England could do little to protect the New England  colonists, and could do nothing to punish them for acting independently.  The New England colonists were surrounded by foreigners. There were the  French on the north and the east, and the Dutch on the west. The  Indians, too, were living in their midst and might at any time turn on  the whites and kill them. Thinking all these things over, the four  leading colonies decided to join together for protection. They formed  the New England Confederation, and drew up a constitution. The colonists  living in Rhode Island and in Maine did not belong to the Confederation,  but they enjoyed many of the benefits flowing from it; for it was quite  certain that the Indians and the French and the Dutch would think twice  before attacking any of the New England settlements.    [Illustration: A CHILD'S HIGH CHAIR, ABOUT 1650.]    [Sidenote: Education.]    56. Social Conditions.--The New England colonies were all settled  on the town system, for there were no industries which demanded large  plantations--as tobacco-planting. The New Englanders were small farmers,  mechanics, ship-builders, and fishermen. There were few servants in New  England and almost no negro slaves. Most of the laborers were free men  and worked for wages as laborers now do. Above all, the New Englanders  were very zealous in the matter of education. Harvard College was  founded in 1636. A few years later a law was passed compelling every  town to provide schools for all the children in the town.          CHAPTER 7      NEW NETHERLAND AND NEW SWEDEN    [Sidenote: The Dutch East India Company.]    57. The Dutch.--At this time the Dutch were the greatest traders  and shipowners in the world. They were especially interested in the  commerce of the East Indies. Indeed, the Dutch India Company was the  most successful trading company in existence. The way to the East  Indies lay through seas carefully guarded by the Portuguese, so the  Dutch India Company hired Henry Hudson, an English sailor, to search for  a new route to India.    [Sidenote: Henry Hudson.]    [Sidenote: He discovers Hudson's River, 1609. _Higginson_, 88-90;  _Explorers_, 281-296.]    [Sidenote: His death. _Explorers_ 296-302.]    58. Hudson's Voyage, 1609.--He set forth in 1609 in the  _Half-Moon_, a stanch little ship. At first he sailed northward, but ice  soon blocked his way. He then sailed southwestward to find a strait,  which was said to lead through America, north of Chesapeake Bay. On  August 3, 1609, he reached the entrance of what is now New York harbor.  Soon the _Half-Moon_ entered the mouth of the river that still bears her  captain's name. Up, up the river she sailed, until finally she came to  anchor near the present site of Albany. The ship's boats sailed even  farther north. Everywhere the country was delightful. The Iroquois came  off to the ship in their canoes. Hudson received them most kindly--quite  unlike the way Champlain treated other Iroquois Indians at about the  same time, on the shore of Lake Champlain (p. 20). Then Hudson sailed  down the river again and back to Europe. He made one later voyage to  America, this time under the English flag. He was turned adrift by his  men in Hudson's Bay, and perished in the cold and ice.    [Sidenote: The Dutch fur-traders.]    [Sidenote: Settle on Manhattan Island.]    [Sidenote: New Netherland.]    59. The Dutch Fur-Traders.--Hudson's failure to find a new way to  India made the Dutch India Company lose interest in American  exploration. But many Dutch merchants were greatly interested in  Hudson's account of the \"Great River of the Mountain.\" They thought  that they could make money from trading for furs with the Indians. They  sent many expeditions to Hudson's River, and made a great deal of money.  Some of their captains explored the coast northward and southward as far  as Boston harbor and Delaware Bay. Their principal trading-posts were on  Manhattan Island, and near the site of Albany. In 1614 some of the  leading traders obtained from the Dutch government the sole right to  trade between New France and Virginia. They called this region New  Netherland.    [Sidenote: The Dutch West India Company, 1621. _Higginson_, 90-96;  _Explorers_, 303-307; _Source-book_, 42-44.]    [Sidenote: The patroons, 1628.]    60. The Founding of New Netherland.--In 1621 the Dutch West India  Company was founded. Its first object was trade, but it also was  directed \"to advance the peopling\" of the American lands claimed by the  Dutch. Colonists now came over; they settled at New Amsterdam, on the  southern end of Manhattan Island, and also on the western end of Long  Island. By 1628 there were four hundred colonists in New Netherland. But  the colony did not grow rapidly, so the Company tried to interest rich  men in the scheme of colonization, by giving them large tracts of land  and large powers of government. These great land owners were called  patroons. Most of them were not very successful. Indeed, the whole plan  was given up before long, and land was given to any one who would come  out and settle.    [Illustration: THE DUTCH COLONY OF NEW AMSTERDAM.]    [Sidenote: Governor Kieft.]    [Sidenote: Kieft orders the Indians to be killed.]    [Sidenote: Results of the massacre.]    61. Kieft and the Indians, 1643-44.--The worst of the early Dutch  governors was William Kieft (Keeft). He was a bankrupt and a thief, who  was sent to New Netherland in the hope that he would reform. At first he  did well and put a stop to the smuggling and cheating which were common  in the colony. Emigrants came over in large numbers, and everything  seemed to be going on well when Kieft's brutality brought on an Indian  war that nearly destroyed the colony. The Indians living near New  Amsterdam sought shelter from the Iroquois on the mainland opposite  Manhattan Island. Kieft thought it would be a grand thing to kill all  these Indian neighbors while they were collected together. He sent a  party of soldiers across the river and killed many of them. The result  was a fierce war with all the neighboring tribes. The Dutch colonists  were driven from their farms. Even New Amsterdam with its stockade was  not safe. For the Indians sometimes came within the stockade and killed  the people in the town. When there were less than two hundred people  left in New Amsterdam, Kieft was recalled, and Peter Stuyvesant was sent  as governor in his stead.    [Sidenote: Peter Stuyvesant. _Higginson_, 97.]    62. Stuyvesant's Rule.--Stuyvesant was a hot-tempered, energetic  soldier who had lost a leg in the Company's service. He ruled New  Netherland for a long time, from 1647 to 1664. And he ruled so sternly  that the colonists were glad when the English came and conquered them.  This unpopularity was not entirely Stuyvesant's fault. The Dutch West  India Company was a failure. It had no money to spend for the defence of  the colonists, and Stuyvesant was obliged to lay heavy taxes on  the people.    [Sidenote: The Swedes on the Delaware. _Higginson_, 106-108.]    [Sidenote: Stuyvesant conquers them.]    63. New Sweden.--When the French, the English, and the Dutch were  founding colonies in America, the Swedes also thought that they might as  well have a colony there too. They had no claim to any land in America.  But Swedish armies were fighting the Dutchmen's battles in Europe. So  the Swedes sent out a colony to settle on lands claimed by the Dutch.  As long as the European war went on, the Swedes were not interfered  with. But when the European war came to an end, Stuyvesant was told to  conquer them. This he did without much trouble, as he had about as many  soldiers as there were Swedish colonists. In this way New Sweden became  a part of New Netherland.    [Sidenote: Summary.]    [Sidenote: The Chesapeake Colonies.]    [Sidenote: The New England Colonies.]    64. Summary.--We have seen how the French, the Dutch, the Swedish,  and the English colonies were established on the Atlantic seashore and  in the St. Lawrence valley. South of these settlements there was the  earlier Spanish colony at St. Augustine. The Spanish colonists were very  few in number, but they gave Spain a claim to Florida. The Swedish  colony had been absorbed by the stronger Dutch colony. We have also seen  how very unlike were the two English groups of colonies. They were both  settled by Englishmen, but there the likeness stops. For Virginia and  Maryland were slave colonies. They produced large crops of tobacco. The  New England colonists on the other hand were practically all free. They  lived in towns and engaged in all kinds of industries. In the next  hundred years we shall see how the English conquered first the Dutch and  then the French; how they planted colonies far to the south of Virginia  and in these ways occupied the whole coast north of Florida.
