I had no doubt then that Steele intended to make him stand out before  this crowd as the real mayor of Linrock or as a man whose office was a  sham.    \"I've arrested a criminal,\" said Steele. \"Bud Snell. I charge him with  assault on Jim Hoden and attempted robbery--if not murder. Snell had a  shady past here, as the court will know if it keeps a record.\"    Then I saw Snell hunching down on a bench, a nerveless and shaken man  if there ever was one. He had been a hanger-on round the gambling dens,  the kind of sneak I never turned my back to.    Jim Hoden, the restaurant keeper, was present also, and on second glance  I saw that he was pale. There was blood on his face. I knew Jim, liked  him, had tried to make a friend of him.    I was not dead to the stinging interrogation in the concluding sentence  of Steele's speech. Then I felt sure I had correctly judged Steele's  motive. I began to warm to the situation.    \"What's this I hear about you, Bud? Get up and speak for yourself,\" said  Sampson, gruffly.    Snell got up, not without a furtive glance at Steele, and he had  shuffled forward a few steps toward the mayor. He had an evil front,  but not the boldness even of a rustler.    \"It ain't so, Sampson,\" he began loudly. \"I went in Hoden's place fer  grub. Some feller I never seen before come in from the hall an' hit him  an' wrastled him on the floor. Then this big Ranger grabbed me an'  fetched me here. I didn't do nothin'. This Ranger's hankerin' to arrest  somebody. Thet's my hunch, Sampson.\"    \"What have you to say about this, Hoden?\" sharply queried Sampson. \"I  call to your mind the fact that you once testified falsely in court, and  got punished for it.\"    Why did my sharpened and experienced wits interpret a hint of threat or  menace in Sampson's reminder? Hoden rose from the bench and with an  unsteady hand reached down to support himself.    He was no longer young, and he seemed broken in health and spirit. He  had been hurt somewhat about the head.    \"I haven't much to say,\" he replied. \"The Ranger dragged me here. I told  him I didn't take my troubles to court. Besides, I can't swear it was  Snell who hit me.\"    Sampson said something in an undertone to Judge Owens, and that worthy  nodded his great, bushy head.    \"Bud, you're discharged,\" said Sampson bluntly. \"Now, the rest of you  clear out of here.\"    He absolutely ignored the Ranger. That was his rebuff to Steele's  advances, his slap in the face to an interfering Ranger Service.    If Sampson was crooked he certainly had magnificent nerve. I almost  decided he was above suspicion. But his nonchalance, his air of  finality, his authoritative assurance--these to my keen and practiced  eyes were in significant contrast to a certain tenseness of line about  his mouth and a slow paling of his olive skin.    He had crossed the path of Vaughn Steele; he had blocked the way of this  Texas Ranger. If he had intelligence and remembered Steele's fame, which  surely he had, then he had some appreciation of what he had undertaken.    In that momentary lull my scrutiny of Sampson gathered an impression of  the man's intense curiosity.    Then Bud Snell, with a cough that broke the silence, shuffled a couple  of steps toward the door.    \"Hold on!\" called Steele.    It was a bugle-call. It halted Snell as if it had been a bullet. He  seemed to shrink.    \"Sampson, I _saw_ Snell attack Hoden,\" said Steele, his voice still  ringing. \"What has the court to say to that?\"    The moment for open rupture between Ranger Service and Sampson's idea of  law was at hand. Sampson showed not the slightest hesitation.    \"The court has to say this: West of the Pecos we'll not aid or abet or  accept any Ranger Service. Steele, we don't want you out here. Linrock  doesn't need you.\"    \"That's a lie, Sampson,\" retorted Steele. \"I've a pocket full of letters  from Linrock citizens, all begging for Ranger Service.\"    Sampson turned white. The veins corded at his temples. He appeared about  to burst into rage. He was at a loss for a quick reply.    Steele shook a long arm at the mayor.    \"I need your help. You refuse. Now, I'll work alone. This man Snell  goes to Del Rio in irons.\"    George Wright rushed up to the table. The blood showed black and thick  in his face; his utterance was incoherent, his uncontrollable outbreak  of temper seemed out of all proportion to any cause he should reasonably  have had for anger.    Sampson shoved him back with a curse and warning glare.    \"Where's your warrant to arrest Snell?\" shouted Sampson. \"I won't give  you one. You can't take him without a warrant.\"    \"I don't need warrants to make arrests. Sampson, you're ignorant of the  power of Texas Rangers.\"    \"You'll take Snell without papers?\" bellowed Sampson.    \"He goes to Del Rio to jail,\" answered Steele.    \"He won't. You'll pull none of your damned Ranger stunts out here. I'll  block you, Steele.\"    That passionate reply of Sampson's appeared to be the signal Steele had  been waiting for.    He had helped on the crisis. I believed I saw how he wanted to force  Sampson's hand and show the town his stand.    Steele backed clear of everybody and like two swift flashes of light his  guns leaped forth. He was transformed. My wish was fulfilled.    Here was Steele, the Ranger, in one of his lone lion stands. Not exactly  alone either, for my hands itched for my guns!    \"Men! I call on you all!\" cried Steele, piercingly. \"I call on you to  witness the arrest of a criminal opposed by Sampson, mayor of Linrock.  It will be recorded in the report sent to the Adjutant General at  Austin. Sampson, I warn you--don't follow up your threat.\"    Sampson sat white with working jaw.    \"Snell, come here,\" ordered Steele.    The man went as if drawn and appeared to slink out of line with the  guns. Steele's cold gray glance held every eye in the hall.    \"Take the handcuffs out of my pocket. This side. Go over to Gorsech with  them. Gorsech, snap those irons on Snell's wrists. Now, Snell, back here  to the right of me.\"    It was no wonder to me to see how instantly Steele was obeyed. He might  have seen more danger in that moment than was manifest to me; on the  other hand he might have wanted to drive home hard what he meant.    It was a critical moment for those who opposed him. There was death in  the balance.    This Ranger, whose last resort was gun-play, had instantly taken the  initiative, and his nerve chilled even me. Perhaps though, he read this  crowd differently from me and saw that intimidation was his cue. I  forgot I was not a spectator, but an ally.    \"Sampson, you've shown your hand,\" said Steele, in the deep voice that  carried so far and held those who heard. \"Any honest citizen of Linrock  can now see what's plain--yours is a damn poor hand!    \"You're going to hear me call a spade a spade. Your office is a farce.  In the two years you've been mayor you've never arrested one rustler.  Strange, when Linrock's a nest for rustlers! You've never sent a  prisoner to Del Rio, let alone to Austin. You have no jail.    \"There have been nine murders since you took office, innumerable street  fights and hold-ups. _Not one arrest!_ But you have ordered arrests for  trivial offenses, and have punished these out of all proportion.    \"There have been law-suits in your court--suits over water rights,  cattle deals, property lines. Strange how in these law-suits, you or  Wright or other men close to you were always involved! Stranger how it  seems the law was stretched to favor your interests!\"    Steele paused in his cold, ringing speech. In the silence, both outside  and inside the hall, could be heard the deep breathing of agitated men.    I would have liked to search for possible satisfaction on the faces of  any present, but I was concerned only with Sampson. I did not need to  fear that any man might draw on Steele.    Never had I seen a crowd so sold, so stiff, so held! Sampson was indeed  a study. Yet did he betray anything but rage at this interloper?    \"Sampson, here's plain talk for you and Linrock to digest,\" went  on Steele. \"I don't accuse you and your court of dishonesty. I  say--_strange_! Law here has been a farce. The motive behind all  this laxity isn't plain to me--yet. But I call your hand!\"          Chapter 3    SOUNDING THE TIMBER      When Steele left the hall, pushing Snell before him, making a lane  through the crowd, it was not any longer possible to watch everybody.    Yet now he seemed to ignore the men behind him. Any friend of Snell's  among the vicious element might have pulled a gun. I wondered if Steele  knew how I watched those men at his back--how fatal it would have been  for any of them to make a significant move.    No--I decided that Steele trusted to the effect his boldness had  created. It was this power to cow ordinary men that explained so many of  his feats; just the same it was his keenness to read desperate men, his  nerve to confront them, that made him great.    The crowd followed Steele and his captive down the middle of the main  street and watched him secure a team and buckboard and drive off on the  road to Sanderson.    Only then did that crowd appear to realize what had happened. Then my  long-looked-for opportunity arrived. In the expression of silent men  I found something which I had sought; from the hurried departure of  others homeward I gathered import; on the husky, whispering lips of yet  others I read words I needed to hear.    The other part of that crowd--to my surprise, the smaller part--was the  roaring, threatening, complaining one.    Thus I segregated Linrock that was lawless from Linrock that wanted law,  but for some reason not yet clear the latter did not dare to voice their  choice.    How could Steele and I win them openly to our cause? If that could be  done long before the year was up Linrock would be free of violence and  Captain Neal's Ranger Service saved to the State.    I went from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15586"],[0,"India, Old and New (#7)"],[1,"a  considerable portion of his time in the bamboo garden which King  Bimbisara presented to him on the outskirts of Rajagriha. There, and in  his annual wanderings through the country, he delivered to the poor and  to the rich, to the Brahman and to the sinner, to princes and peasants,  to women as well as to men, his message of spiritual and social  deliverance from the thraldom of the flesh and from the tyranny of  caste.    With the actual doctrines of Buddhism I do not propose to deal. There is  nothing in them that could not be reconciled with those of the Vedanta,  and they are especially closely akin to the Sankhya system. But the  driving force of Buddhism, as also of Jainism, which grew up at the same  time as Buddhism under the inspiration of another great reformer,  Mahavira, who is said to have been a cousin of King Bimbisara, was a  spirit of revolt against Brahmanical Hinduism, and a new sense of social  solidarity which appealed to all classes and castes, and to women as  well as to men. The Vedanta reserved the study of the scriptures to men  of the three \"twice-born\" castes, and placed it under the supreme  authority of the Brahmans. Both Buddha and Mahavira recognised no such  restrictions, though they did not refuse reverence to the Brahman as a  man of special learning. The religious orders which they founded were  open to all, and these orders included nuns as well as monks. This was  the rock on which they split with Hinduism. This was the social  revolution that, in spite of the religious and philosophical elasticity  of Hinduism, made Buddhists and Jains unpardonable heretics in the eyes  of the Brahmans, and produced a conflict which was to last for  centuries.    Though King Bimbisara welcomed the Buddha to his capital, and Buddhism  made rapid headway amongst the masses, he does not appear to have  himself embraced the new religion, and it is not till after Alexander  the Great's expedition had for the first time brought an European  conqueror on to Indian soil, and a new dynasty had transferred the seat  of government to Pataliputra, the modern Patna, on the Ganges, that  perhaps the greatest of Indian rulers, the Emperor Asoka, who reigned  from 272 to _circa_ 232 B.C., made Buddhism the state religion of his  Empire. Tradition has it, that when Buddha on his last wanderings  passed by the fort which King Ajatasatni was building at Pataliputra, he  prophesied for it a great and glorious future. It had already fulfilled  that prophecy when the Greek Ambassador, Megasthenes, visited it in 303  B.C. A few remains only are being laboriously rescued from the waters of  the Ganges, under which Pataliputra is for the most part buried. But at  that time it spread for ten miles along the river front; five hundred  and seventy towers crowned its walls, which were pierced by sixty-four  gates, and the total circumference of the city was twenty-four miles.  The palace rivalled those of the Kings of Persia, and a striking  topographical similarity has been lately traced between the artificial  features of the lay-out of Pataliputra and the natural features of  Persepolis, King Darius's capital in Southern Persia.    Pataliputra became the capital of India under Chandragupta Maurya, who,  soldier of fortune and usurper that he was, transformed the small  kingdom of Magadha into a mighty empire. Known to Greek historians as  Sandrokottos, young Chandragupta had been in Alexander's camp on the  Indus, and had even, it is said, offered his services to the Macedonian  king. In the confusion which followed Alexander's death, he had raised  an army with which he fell on the Macedonian frontier garrisons, and  then, flushed with victory, turned upon the King of Magadha, whom he  dethroned. After eighteen years of constant fighting he had extended his  frontiers to the Hindu Kush in the north, and nearly down to the  latitude of Madras in the south. He had, at the same time, established a  remarkable system of both civil and military administration by which he  was able to consolidate his vast conquests. His war office was  scientifically divided into six boards for maintaining and supplying his  huge fighting force of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 9000 elephants,  and 8000 war chariots, besides fully equipped transport and commissariat  services. No less scientific was the system of civil government as  illustrated by the municipal institutions of Pataliputra. There, again,  there were six boards dealing respectively with trade, industries,  wages, local taxation, the control of foreign residents and visitors,  and, perhaps most extraordinary of all, with vital statistics. Equally  admirable was the solicitude displayed for agriculture, then, as now,  the greatest of Indian industries, and for its handmaid, irrigation. The  people themselves, if we may believe Megasthenes, were a model people  well worthy of a model government, though if he does not exaggerate, one  is driven to wonder at the necessity for such fearful penalties as were  inflicted for the most trivial breaches of the law. But behind  Chandragupta the power of the Brahman was still clearly entrenched, for  his chief minister was a Brahman, Chanakya, who had followed his  fortunes from their first adventurous beginnings.    The stately fabric which Chandragupta built up during his own  twenty-five years' reign, _circa_ 322-297 B.C., endured during the reign  of his son Bendusara, of whom scarcely anything is known, and at the end  of another twenty-five years passed on, undiminished, to his great  successor, Asoka, whose unique experiment would have been scarcely  possible had he not succeeded to an empire already firmly consolidated  at home and abroad. When he came to the throne, about 272 B.C., Asoka  had served his apprenticeship in the art of government as viceroy, first  in the north at Taxila, and then in the west at Ujjain. He had been  brought up by Brahmans in the manner befitting his rank. Buddhist  tradition would have us believe that until his conversion he was a  monster of cruelty; but there is scarcely enough to warrant that  indictment in the fact that he began his reign with a war of aggression,  for which he afterwards expressed the deepest remorse. It was, indeed,  from that moment that he determined to be henceforth a prince of peace;  but it is quite as probable that his determination inclined him more and  more to turn his ear to Buddhist teaching as that Buddhist teaching  prompted his determination.    No monarch has ever recorded the laws which he gave to his people in  such imperishable shape. They are to be seen to the present day cut into  granite pillars or chiselled into the face of the living rock in almost  every part of what was then the Empire of the Mauryas, from the Peshawar  district in the north to Mysore and the Madras Presidency in the south,  from the Kathiawar Peninsula in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the  east. The pillars are often at the same time monuments of artistic  design and workmanship, as, above all, the Garnath pillar near Benares  with its magnificent capital of the well-known Persepolitan type and its  four lions supporting the stone Wheel of the Law, first promulgated on  that spot. Many more of Asoka's monuments may yet be discovered, but the  eleven pillar edicts and the fourteen rock edicts, not to speak of minor  inscriptions already brought to light and deciphered, constitute a body  of laws which well deserve to have been made thus imperishable. For no  temporal sovereign has ever legislated so fully and exclusively and with  such evident conviction for the spiritual advancement and moral  elevation of his people. Scarcely less important is the autobiographical  value of these inscriptions, which enable one to follow stage by stage  the evolution of the Apostle-Emperor's soul. Within a year of the  conquest of the Kalinjas, for which he afterwards publicly recorded his  remorse, Asoka became a lay disciple of the Buddhist law, and two and a  half years later studied as a Buddhist monk. In 257 B.C., the thirteenth  year of his reign, he began to preach his series of sermons in  stone--sermons that were at the same time laws given to his Empire. His  profession of faith was as lofty as it was simple:         The gods who were regarded as true all over India have been shown       to be untrue. For the fruit of exertion is not to be attained by a       great man only, because even by the small man who chooses to exert       himself immense heavenly bliss may be won.... Father and mother       must be hearkened to. Similarly, respect for living creatures must       be firmly established. Truth must be spoken. These are the virtues       of the law of piety which must be practised.... In it are included       proper treatment of slaves and servants, honour to teachers,       gentleness towards living creatures, and liberality towards       ascetics and Brahmans.... All men are my children, and just as I       desire for my children that they may enjoy every kind of prosperity       and happiness in both this world and the next, so I desire the same       for all men.    These principles are applied in all the instructions to his officials.  He commends to their special care the primitive jungle folk and the  untamed people of the borderlands. He bestows much thought on the  alleviation of human suffering, and his injunctions in restriction of  the slaughter and maiming of animals and the preservation of life are  minute and precise. It is in this connection that the influence of  Buddhism on Hinduism has been most permanent, for whilst the primitive  Aryan Hindus were beef-eaters, their descendants carried the vegetarian  doctrines of Buddhism to the extreme length of condemning cow-killing as  the most awful of crimes, next to the killing of a Brahman.    Determined to preserve the unity and discipline of his own church,  Asoka's large tolerance sees some good"]]]
