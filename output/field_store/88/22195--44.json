Still Grace felt confident that her team would rise to the occasion when  the game was called. They were two well-trained, too certain of their  powers to ever think of failing.    The bad weather had evidently not depressed the spirits of their  opponents. The juniors stood about laughing and talking. Julia Crosby  moved from one girl to the other whispering slyly.    \"Wretch!\" thought Grace. \"How disagreeable she is. She was born too late.  She should have lived in the middle ages, when plotting was the fashion.  She is anything but a credit to her class and dear old Oakdale High  School.\"    Grace's rather vehement reflections were cut short by the approach of Miss  Thompson, who stopped to say a word of cheer to the girls before taking  her seat in the gallery.    \"Well, Grace,\" she said, \"this is a rather bad day outside, but still  there will be a few loyal souls to cheer you on to victory. May the best  man win. You must put forth every energy if you expect to conquer the  juniors, however. They have held the championship a long time.\"    \"They will not hold it after to-day if we can help it,\" answered Grace.  \"We feel fairly sure that we can whip them.\"    \"That is the right spirit,\" said Miss Thompson. \"Confidence is first  cousin to success, you know.\"    \"Was there ever a teacher quite like Miss Thompson?\" asked Nora as the  principal left them to take her seat in the gallery.    \"She is a dear,\" said Marian Barber, \"and she's on our side, too.\"    \"There's the referee now!\" exclaimed Grace. \"Now, girls, make up your  minds to play as you never played before. Remember it's for the honor of  the sophomores.\"    By this time the gallery was half filled with an audience largely composed  of High School boys and girls. A few outsiders were present. Mrs. Harlowe  had come to see her daughter's team win the game, she said; for she knew  that Grace's heart was set on victory.    The referee, time-keeper and scorer chosen from the senior class took  their places. The whistle blew and the teams lined up. There was a round  of loud applause from the fans of both teams. The players presented a fine  appearance. The earnest, \"do or die\" expression on every face made the  spectators feel that the coming game would be well worth seeing.    The rival captains faced each other, ready to jump for the ball the  instant it left the referee's hands. There was a moment of expectant  silence; then the referee put the ball in play, the whistle blew and the  game began. Both captains sprang for the ball, but alas for the  sophomores, Julia Crosby caught it and threw it to the junior right  forward. It looked for a minute as though the juniors would score without  effort, but Nora O'Malley, who was left guard, succeeded so effectually in  annoying her opponent that when the bewildered goal-thrower did succeed in  throwing the ball, it fell wide of the basket. It had barely touched the  floor before there was a rush for it, and the fun waxed fast and furious.    During the first five minutes neither side scored; then the tide turned  in favor of the juniors and they netted the ball.    Grace Harlowe set her teeth, resolving to play harder than ever. The  juniors should not score again if she could help it. Nora had the ball and  was dribbling it for dear life. Grace signaled her team, who responded  instantly; but, to their consternation, the juniors seemed to understand  the signal as fully as did their own team, and quickly blocking their  play, scored again.    There was a howl of delight from the junior fans in the gallery. The  sudden triumph of the enemy seemed to daze the sophomores. They looked at  their captain in amazement, then sprang once more to their work. But the  trend the game was taking had affected them, and in their desperate  efforts to score they made mistakes. Miriam Nesbit ran with the ball and a  foul was called, which resulted in the juniors scoring a point.    Nora O'Malley, in her excitement, caught the forward she was guarding by  the arm, and again a foul was called; this time, however, the juniors made  nothing from it. But the precious time was flying and only four minutes of  the first half remained. Again Grace signaled for another secret play, and  again the juniors rose to the occasion and thwarted her.    It was maddening.    The score stood 7 to 0 in favor of the juniors. Miriam Nesbit had the ball  now, and was trying to throw it. She stood near the junior basket. Eluding  her guard, who was dancing about in front of her, she made a wild throw.  Whether by accident or design it was hard to tell, but the ball landed  squarely in the junior basket. A whoop went up from the gallery. The  whistle blew and the first half was over. The score stood 9 to 0 in favor  of the enemy. The last two points had been presented to the juniors.    Up in the gallery discussion ran rife. The admirers of the juniors were  loud in their praise of the superior ability of the team. The junior  class, who were sitting in a body at one end of the gallery, grew  especially noisy, and were laughing derisively at the downfall of the  sophomores.    Miss Thompson was puzzled.    \"I cannot imagine what ails my sophomores,\" she said to the teacher next  to her. \"I understood that they were such fine players. Yet they don't  seem to be able to hold their own. It looks as though their defeat were  inevitable, unless they do some remarkable playing during the next half.\"    Mrs. Harlowe, too, was disappointed. She wondered why Grace had boasted so  much of her team.    \"After all, they are little more than children,\" she thought. \"Those  juniors seem older to me.\"    As for Grace and her team--they were sitting in a room just off the  gymnasium gloomily discussing the situation. Tears of mortification stood  in Nora's eyes, while Grace was putting forth every effort to appear calm.  She knew that if she showed the least sign of faltering all would be lost.  Her players must feel that she still had faith in their ability to win.    \"We are not beaten yet, girls,\" she said, \"and I believe we shall make up  in the last half what we lost in the first. Work fast, but keep your wits  about you. Don't give the referee any chance to call a foul, we can't  spare a minute from now on. When I give the signal for a certain play, be  on the alert, and please, please don't any of you present those juniors  with any more points. I'm not blaming you, Miriam, for I know that last  throw of yours was an accident, but I could have cried when that ball went  into the basket.\"    Miriam's face flushed; then realizing that all eyes were turned toward  her, she said sarcastically:    \"Really, Miss Harlowe, it's so kind of you to look at it in that light.  However, anyone with common sense would have known without being told that  I never intended that ball for the juniors.\"    \"I am not so sure of that,\" muttered Nora, who, seeing the hurt look that  crept into Grace's eyes at Miriam's words, immediately rose in behalf of  her captain.    Miriam whirled on Nora.    \"What did you say?\" asked Miriam angrily.    Before Nora could answer the whistle blew. Intermission was over and the  second half was on. The teams changed baskets and stood in readiness for  work. Once more Grace and Julia Crosby faced each other. There was a  malicious gleam in Julia's eye and a look of determination in Grace's.  With a spring, Grace caught the ball as it descended and threw it to Nora,  who, eluding her guard, tossed it to Miriam. With unerring aim Miriam sent  the ball into the basket and the sophomores scored for the first time.    Their friends in the gallery applauded vigorously and began to take heart,  but their joy was short-lived, for as the play proceeded the sophomores  steadily lost what little ground they had gained. Try as they might, they  could make no headway. Grace called for play after play, only to find that  in some inexplicable way the enemy seemed to know just what she meant, and  acted accordingly.    The game neared its close and the sophomores fought with the desperation  of the doomed. They knew that they could not win save by a miracle, but  they resolved to die hard. The ball was in Miriam's hands and she made a  feint at throwing it to Nora, but whirled and threw it to Grace, who,  divining her intention, ran forward to receive it. There was a rush on the  part of the juniors. Julia Crosby, crossing in front of Grace, managed  slyly to thrust one foot forward. Grace tripped and fell to the floor,  twisting one leg under her. The ball rolled on, and was caught by the  enemy, who threw it to goal just as the whistle sounded for the last time.  The juniors had won. The score stood 17 to 2 in their favor. The scorer  attempted to announce it, but her voice was lost in the noisy yells of the  junior class in the gallery.    The fact that Grace Harlowe still sat on the gymnasium floor passed for a  moment unnoticed. In the final grand rush for the ball, the other players  failed to see that their valiant captain still occupied the spot where she  fell. Tumbles were not infrequent, and Grace was well able to take care of  herself.    Anne Pierson alone saw Julia Crosby's foot slide out, and, scenting  treachery, hastily left her seat in the gallery. She ran as fast as she  could to where Grace sat, reaching her a few seconds after the whistle  blew.    \"Good little Anne,\" called Grace. \"You have come to my rescue even though  the others have deserted me. Perhaps you can help me up. I tried it, but  my ankle hurts every time I try to stand.\"    Her face was very white, and Anne saw that she was in great pain.    By this time Grace's team, realizing she was not with them, began looking  about, and rushed over to her in a body. David, Reddy and Hippy appeared  on the scene, as did Mrs. Harlowe, accompanied by Miss Thompson.  Excitement reigned. The boys lifted Grace to her feet; but she cried"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15352"],[0,"Venereal Diseases in New Zealand (1922) (#7)"],[1," saw twenty years ago have  now disappeared.    \"In my experience of eighteen years' constant work amongst the Maoris  venereal disease has been comparatively rare. It disappeared amongst the  people, only to recrudesce in some localities as fresh infection was  introduced by the white man, or brought back to the settlements by  visits to the white towns. I see very little of it at present, but now  and again hear reports from medical officers that it has cropped up in  the settlements near them ... In all these cases I am convinced that the  origin is from a white source, and the problem amongst the Maoris is not  nearly so serious as amongst Europeans. It seems to me unjust that the  idea should be circulated that the Maoris are a source of danger to the  European community--the reverse is much more likely.    \"It is impossible for me to supply accurate data as to the incidence of  the disease amongst the Maori race at present, but I am confident that  reports have a natural tendency to become exaggerated. I do not consider  that returned Maori soldiers, owing to the treatment they received  before being discharged from the service, have been a factor in the  introduction of the disease amongst the settlements. If they have in  some areas, it has been from fresh infection, which their experience of  prostitution in Egypt and Europe has made them more liable to acquire  from professional and amateur prostitutes in towns. At the same time,  the experience of returned soldiers as to the value of treatment makes  them more likely to seek such aid.\"    (E.) _Death-certificates._    There are no trustworthy statistics in any part of the British Empire of  the deaths due to venereal disease. Many persons die from illnesses  which result from an initial syphilis contracted perhaps many years  prior to death. It is well known that medical practitioners, from a  laudable desire to spare the feelings of relatives, refrain from stating  the primary cause of death in such cases, and merely enter the secondary  or proximate cause. For the same reason, the statistics regarding deaths  due to alcoholism, and perhaps in a less degree some other factors in  the mortality returns, are incomplete and consequently useless.    Both the Royal Commission on Venereal Diseases and the Birth-rate  Commission recommended that the medical attendant should issue two  certificates--one, which would be a simple certificate of death, to be  handed to the relatives, and the other, a confidential certificate  giving the primary cause of death, which would be transmitted to the  Registrar.    The Registrar-General for New Zealand, Mr. W.W. Cook, in his evidence in  chief, stated that he did not favour these suggestions. A certificate of  death, he said, cannot be regarded as confidential, as the information  contained therein is recorded in the death entry, which may be inspected  by the public, and of which a copy may be obtained by any applicant. In  reply to questions, however, he stated that the law could no doubt be  altered so as to make the death-certificate confidential, the  information to be given up only on an order from a Court of justice.  Apart from the fact that the insurance companies might object, he did  not see any objection from the public point of view.    Mr. Malcolm Fraser, the Government Statistician, said that there was  considerable division of opinion on this question at the British Empire  Statistical Conference held in London in 1920, when statisticians from  all parts of the Empire were present. It was generally agreed that the  system was good theoretically, but some doubt was expressed whether in  practice there would be as much improvement as was expected, since the  system would depend entirely on the medical attendant strictly complying  therewith and disclosing the true cause of death in every case. Any  system of confidential information always had that failing. The witness  thought the register must be open for persons having a right to call for  copies of entries. In dealing with insurance claims at death the truth  or otherwise of the statement in the proposal form was important, and  might require verification by inspection of the death entry. At the  Conference Dr. Stevenson, the Statistician to the Registrar-General of  the United Kingdom, was very pronounced in his advocacy of the  confidential form of certificate. The Conference passed the following  resolutions: \"(1.) That the present system of open certification tends  to prevent candid statements of the causes of death, and thus introduces  a systematic error into death statistics. (2.) That the error would be  eliminated by a system of confidential certification.\"    The Committee, while agreeing that such a system of registration of  deaths would undoubtedly afford better means of approximating to correct  returns of mortality not only from venereal diseases but also from  alcoholism and some other diseases, would point out that, if New Zealand  were to adopt the reform while the rest of the Empire retained the  present system, the result would be to place the Dominion in an  apparently unfavourable light in comparison with other parts of the  Empire in regard to the mortality from these diseases.      SECTION 2.--CAUSES OF THE PREVALENCE OF VENEREAL DISEASES IN NEW  ZEALAND.    In discussing this order of reference the Committee desire it clearly  understood that these causes are not peculiar to New Zealand, and do not  operate more extensively in New Zealand than elsewhere. The Committee  are concerned, however, in discussing this question only as it affects  New Zealand.    The causes of the spread of venereal disease may be classified under two  main headings: (1) The presence of infected individuals acting as foci  of infection; (2) the occurrence of promiscuous sexual intercourse, by  which in the great majority of cases the disease is actually transmitted  from one individual to another.    (1.) _The Presence of Infected Individuals._    These sources of infection arise and persist for the following  reasons:--         (1.) Neglect by infected persons to undergo treatment. (2.) Neglect       to continue treatment till no longer infective. (3.) The treatment       of infected individuals by unqualified persons, such as chemists,       herbalists, chiropractors, &c. In these cases the disease becomes       chronic, and the best opportunity for its treatment and cure has       passed before the case is seen by a medical man. (4.) By the       introduction of venereal disease to this country from overseas.    (2.) _The Occurrence of Promiscuous Sexual Intercourse._    A striking portion of the evidence placed before the Committee was that  which showed the very small amount of professional prostitution in New  Zealand. This was supported by the valuable evidence of Mr. W. Dinnie,  ex-Commissioner of Police, and Mr. A.H. Wright, Commissioner of Police.  The latter witness stated that there were only 104 professional  prostitutes in the Dominion.    It would appear also that the professional prostitute, as a result of  her knowledge and experience, is less likely to transmit venereal  disease than the \"amateur.\" It is therefore principally to clandestine  or amateur prostitution that one must look for the dissemination of the  disease, and inquiry into the conditions which tend to the production of  the amateur prostitute is a direct inquiry into the causes of the  prevalence of venereal disease.    The evidence before the Committee shows that this promiscuity is very  prevalent, and that it is not confined to any particular social strata.  The fact is also strikingly demonstrated by Table A in the appendix.  From this table it will be seen that during the period 1913-21 there  were 10,841 illegitimate births and 33,738 legitimate first births  within one year after marriage. If to the illegitimate births we add the  total number of live births occurring within the first seven months of  marriage viz., 12,235--which may be safely considered to have been  conceived before marriage, we get a total of 23,076 births in which  conception took place extra-maritally. In other words, more than 50 per  cent. of total first births occurring within twelve months of marriage  result from sexual contact prior to marriage.    Some factors which contribute in a greater or less degree to the moral  laxity which leads to promiscuous sexual intercourse are:--         (1.) The relaxation of parental control, which was emphasized by       many witnesses. Girls stay less at home and assist less in the work       of the home, preferring whenever opportunity offers, to go to the       pictures or some other form of entertainment.         (2.) Lack of education of the young in the facts pertaining to sex.       Especially the Committee would call attention to the unfounded       belief of many that continence in young men is injurious to health.         (3.) Bad housing and general conditions of living. When members of       both sexes are crowded together in restricted accommodation in       which often insufficient conveniences are supplied, it is easy to       conceive of a relaxation of the proprieties of life which might       lead to acts of immorality.         In this connection the Committee desire to call attention to the       excellent work done by the Y.W.C.A. and other bodies in the       provision of hostels in which girls are provided with board and       lodging at very reasonable cost. The Committee were surprised to       learn that full advantage was not taken of these provisions, and       that the accommodation at these hostels was not fully occupied. It       would appear that many girls resent the very slight amount of       supervision and restraint exercised over them, precisely as they do       parental control.         (4.) The presence in the community of individuals, especially       girls, who are to some degree mentally defective or"]]]
