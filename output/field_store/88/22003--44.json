We can't no ways drink  unless the gent that's setting them out takes something himself. It  ain't done that way in our part of the land,\" said Ronicky.    \"It ain't?\"    \"Never!\"    \"Come, come! That's a good joke. But, even if I can't be with you,  boys, drink hearty.\"    Ronicky Doone shook his head. \"No joke at all,\" he said firmly.  \"Matter of politeness that a lot of gents are terrible hard set on out  where we come from.\"    \"Why, Ronicky,\" protested Bill Gregg, \"ain't you making it a little  strong? For my part I've drunk twenty times without having the gent  that set 'em up touch a thing. I reckon I can do it again. Here's  how!\"    \"Wait!\" declared Ronicky Doone. And there was a little jarring ring  in his voice that arrested the hand of Bill Gregg in the very act of  raising the glass.    Ronicky crossed the room quickly, took a glass from the washstand and,  returning to the center table, poured a liberal drink of the whisky  into it.    \"I dunno about my friend,\" he went on, almost sternly, to the  bewildered hotel keeper. \"I dunno about him, but some gents feel so  strong about not drinking alone that they'd sooner fight. Well, sir,  I'm one of that kind. So I say, there's your liquor. Get rid of it!\"    The fat man reached the center table and propped himself against it,  gasping. His whole big body seemed to be wilting, as though in a  terrific heat. \"I dunno!\" he murmured. \"I dunno what's got into you  fellers. I tell you, I never drink.\"    \"You lie, you fat fool!\" retorted Ronicky. \"Didn't I smell your  breath?\"    Bill Gregg dropped his own glass on the table and hurriedly came to  confront his host by the side of Ronicky.    \"Breath?\" asked the fat man hurriedly, still gasping more and more  heavily for air. \"I--I may have taken a small tonic after dinner. In  fact, think I did. That's all. Nothing more, I assure you. I--I have  to be a sober man in my work.\"    \"You got to make an exception this evening,\" said Ronicky, more  fiercely than ever. \"I ought to make you drink all three drinks for  being so slow about drinking one!\"    \"Three drinks!\" exclaimed the fat man, trembling violently. \"It--it  would kill me!\"    \"I think it would,\" said Ronicky. \"I swear I think it would. And maybe  even one will be a sort of a shock, eh?\"    He commanded suddenly: \"Drink! Drink that glass and clean out the last  drop of it, or we'll tie you and pry your mouth open and pour the  whole bottle down your throat. You understand?\"    A feeble moan came from the throat of the hotel keeper. He cast  one frantic glance toward the door and a still more frantic appeal  centered on Ronicky Doone, but the face of the latter was as cold as  stone.    \"Then take your own glasses, boys,\" he said, striving to smile, as he  picked up his own drink.    \"You drink first, and you drink alone,\" declared Ronicky. \"Now!\"    The movement of his hand was as ominous as if he had whipped out a  revolver. The fat man tossed off the glass of whisky and then stood  with a pudgy hand pressed against his breast and the upward glance of  one who awaits a calamity. Under the astonished eyes of Bill Gregg he  turned pale, a sickly greenish pallor. His eyes rolled, and his hand  on the table shook, and the arm that supported him sagged.    \"Open the window,\" he said. \"The air--there ain't no air. I'm  choking--and--\"    \"Get him some water,\" cried Bill Gregg, \"while I open the window.\"    \"Stay where you are, Bill.\"    \"But he looks like he's dying!\"    \"Then he's killed himself.\"    \"Gents,\" began the fat man feebly and made a short step toward them.  The step was uncompleted. In the middle of it he wavered, put out his  arms and slumped upon his side on the floor.    Bill Gregg cried out softly in astonishment and horror, but Ronicky  Doone knelt calmly beside the fallen bulk and felt the beating of his  heart.    \"He ain't dead,\" he said quietly, \"but he'll be tolerably sick for a  while. Now come along with me.\"    \"But what's all this mean?\" asked Bill Gregg in a whisper, as he  picked up his suit case and hurried after Ronicky.    \"Doped booze,\" said Ronicky curtly.    They hurried down the stairs and came out onto the dark street. There  Ronicky Doone dropped his suit case and dived into a dark nook beside  the entrance. There was a brief struggle. He came out again, pushing  a skulking figure before him, with the man's arm twisted behind his  back.    \"Take off this gent's hat, will you?\" asked Ronicky.    Bill Gregg obeyed, too dumb with astonishment to think. \"It's the taxi  driver!\" he exclaimed.    \"I thought so!\" muttered Ronicky. \"The skunk came back here to wait  till we were fixed right now. What'll we do with him?\"    \"I begin to see what's come off\" said Bill Gregg, frowning into the  white, scowling face of the taxi driver. The man was like a rat, but,  in spite of his fear, he did not make a sound.    \"Over there!\" said Bill Gregg, nodding toward a flight of cellar  steps.    They caught the man between them, rushed him to the steps and flung  him headlong down. There was a crashing fall, groans and then silence.    \"He'll have a broken bone or two, maybe,\" said Ronicky, peering calmly  into the darkness, \"but he'll live to trap somebody else, curse him!\"  And, picking up their suit cases again, they started to retrace their  steps.          Chapter Seven      _The First Clue_    They did not refer to the incidents of that odd reception in New York  until they had located a small hotel for themselves, not three blocks  away. It was no cheaper, but they found a pleasant room, clean and  with electric lights. It was not until they had bathed and were  propped up in their beds for a good-night smoke, which cow-punchers  love, that Bill Gregg asked: \"And what gave you the tip, Ronicky?\"    \"I dunno. In my business you got to learn to watch faces, Bill.  Suppose you sit in at a five-handed game of poker. One gent says  everything with his face, while he's picking up his cards. Another  gent don't say a thing, but he shows what he's got by the way he moves  in his chair, or the way he opens and shuts his hands. When you said  something about our wad I seen the taxi driver blink. Right after that  he got terrible friendly and said he could steer us to a friend of his  that could put us up for the night pretty comfortable. Well, it wasn't  hard to put two and two together. Not that I figured anything out.  Just was walking on my toes, ready to jump in any direction.\"    As for Bill Gregg, he brooded for a time on what he had heard, then he  shook his head and sighed. \"I'd be a mighty helpless kid in this here  town if I didn't have you along, Ronicky,\" he said.    \"Nope,\" insisted Ronicky. \"Long as you use another gent for a sort of  guide you feel kind of helpless. But, when you step off for yourself,  everything is pretty easy. You just were waiting for me to take the  lead, or you'd have done just as much by yourself.\"    Again Bill Gregg sighed, as he shook his head. \"If this is what New  York is like,\" he said, \"we're in for a pretty bad time. And this is  what they call a civilized town? Great guns, they need martial law and  a thousand policemen to the block to keep a gent's life and pocketbook  safe in this town! First gent we meet tries to bump us off or get our  wad. Don't look like we're going to have much luck, Ronicky.\"    \"We saved our hides, I guess.\"    \"That's about all.\"    \"And we learned something.\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Then I figure it was a pretty good night.    \"Another thing, Bill. I got an idea from that taxi gent. I figure that  whole gang of taxi men are pretty sharp in the eye. What I mean is  that we can tramp up and down along this here East River, and now  and then we'll talk to some taxi men that do most of their work from  stands in them parts of the town. Maybe we can get on her trail that  way. Anyways, it's an opening.\"    \"Maybe,\" said Bill Gregg dubiously. He reached under his pillow. \"But  I'm sure going to sleep with a gun under my head in this town!\" With  this remark he settled himself for repose and presently was snoring  loudly.    Ronicky presented a brave face to the morning and at once started  with Bill Gregg to tour along the East River. That first day Ronicky  insisted that they simply walk over the whole ground, so as to become  fairly familiar with the scale of their task. They managed to make the  trip before night and returned to the hotel, footsore from the hard,  hot pavements. There was something unkindly and ungenerous in those  pavements, it seemed to Ronicky. He was discovering to his great  amazement that the loneliness of the mountain desert is nothing at all  compared to the loneliness of the Manhattan crowd.    Two very gloomy and silent cow-punchers ate their dinner that night  and went to bed early. But in the morning they began the actual work  of their campaign. It was an arduous labor. It meant interviewing in  every district one or two storekeepers, and asking the mail carriers  for \"Caroline Smith,\" and showing the picture to taxi drivers. These  latter were the men, insisted Ronicky, who would eventually bring them  to Caroline Smith. \"Because, if they've ever drove a girl as pretty as  that, they'll remember for quite a while.\"    \"But half of these gents ain't going to talk to us, even if they  know,\" Bill Gregg protested, after he had been gruffly refused an  answer a dozen times in the first morning.    \"Some of 'em won't talk,\" admitted Ronicky, \"but that's probably  because they don't know. Take 'em by and large, most gents like to  tell everything they know, and then some!\"    As a matter of fact they met with rather more help than they wanted.  In spite of all their efforts to appear casual there was something  too romantic in this search for a girl to remain entirely unnoticed.  People whom they asked became excited and offered them a thousand  suggestions."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11887"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

With respect to the personal character of Robin Hood, it is generally  agreed that he was active, brave, prudent, patient, possessed of  uncommon bodily strength, and considerable military skill; just,  generous, and beloved by his followers. As proofs of his singular  popularity, his story and exploits have been made the subject of  various dramatic exhibitions, as well of innumerable poems, lyrics,  songs, and ballads; he has given rise to divers proverbs, and to swear  by him was a common practice. Some writers say his songs have been  preferred on solemn occasions, not only to the Psalms of David, but  to the New Testament, and his service to the word of God. We have the  opinion of Bishop Latimer on this head:--\"I came,\" says the bishop  (in his sixth sermon before King Edward VI.) \"to a place, riding on  a journey homeward from London, and I sent word over night into the  town, that I would preach there in the morning, because it was a  holyday, and methought it was a holydayes worke; the churche stode  in my way, and I toke my horse and my companye and went thither. I  thought I should have found a great companye in the churche, and when  I came there, the churche dore was faste locked; I tarried halfe  an houre and more, and at last the keye was founde, and one of the  parishe commes to me, and sayes, 'Syr, thys ys a busye day with us, we  cannot heare you; it is Robyn Hoode's day; the parishe is gone abroad  to gather for Robyn Hoode.' I pray you let them not, I was fayne there  to geve place to Robyn Hoode. I thought my rochet should have been  regarded thoughe I were not; but it woulde not serve, it was fayne  to give place to Robyn Hoode's men. It is no laughyng matter, my  friendes, it is a wepynge matter, a heavy matter under a pretence  for gatherynge for Robyn Hoode, a traytoure and a thefe, to put out  a preacher, to have his office lesse esteemed, to prefer Robyn Hoode  before the mynystration of God's word, and all thys hath come of  unpreachynge prelates. Thys realme hath been il provided, for that  it hath had suche corrupte judgementes in it, to prefer Robyn Hode  to Godde's worde. Yf the bysshoppes had bene preachers, there sholde  never have bene any such thynge,\" &c.    Robin Hood was believed to possess supernatural powers. In the parish  of Halifax is an immense stone or rock, supposed to be a Druidical  monument, there called Robin Hood's penny-stone, which he is said  to have used to pitch with at a mark, for his amusement. There was  likewise another of these stones of several tons weight, which the  country people would say he threw off an adjoining hill with a spade,  as he was digging. At Bitchover, where it was said he lived, among  several groups of rocks, were some stones called Robin Hood's Stride,  being two of the highest and most remarkable. He obtained also the  distinction of sainthood, in having a festival allotted to him, and  solemn games instituted in honour of his memory; a short account of  which will be found in _The Mirror_, No. 544, p. 259. These games were  celebrated till the latter end of the sixteenth century, not by the  populace only, but by kings and princes, and grave magistrates, in  Scotland and in England; being considered in the former country of the  highest political importance, and essential to the civil and religious  liberties of the people; the efforts of government to suppress them  frequently producing tumult and insurrection.    In Ray's Itineraries, 1760, we are told that Robin Hood's bow, one  of his arrows, his chair, his cap, and one of his slippers, were  preserved till within the above century. In Brome's Travels, is the  following notice of his relics: \"having pleased ourselves with the  antiquities of Nottingham, we took horse and went to visit the well,  and ancient chair, of Robin Hood, which is not far from hence, within  the Forest of Sherwood. Being placed in the chair, we had a cap  which they say was his, very formally put upon our heads, and having  performed the usual ceremonies befitting so great a solemnity, we  received the freedom of the chair, and were incorporated into the  society of that renowned brotherhood.\" In Hutton's Journey from  Birmingham to London, 1785, he states, \"I was much pleased with a  slipper, belonging to the famous Robin Hood, shown me, fifty years  ago, at St. Ann's Well, near Nottingham, a place upon the borders of  Sherwood Forest, to which he resorted.\" Over a spring called Robin  Hood's Well, four miles north of Doncaster, is a handsome stone arch,  erected by Lord Carlisle, where passengers from the coach used to  drink of the fair water, and give alms to two people who attended.    Thus, not only did those places retain his name which afforded him  security or amusement, but even the well at which he quenched his  thirst. There is also Robin Hood's Bay, on the coast of Yorkshire.  It is mentioned by Leland as \"a fischer tounlet of 20 bootes caulled  Robyn Huddes Bay, a dok or bosom of a mile yn length:\" in this bay he  often went fishing in the summer season, and not far from this he had  butts or marks set up, where he used to exercise his men in shooting  with the long bow.    After Robin's death, his company dispersed, and are supposed to have  been distinguished from the name of their gallant leader, by the title  of Roberdsmen. It may not be uninteresting to subjoin a short account  of the last days of Robin's friend and favourite, Little John. The  honour of his death and burial is contended by rival nations, first by  England. At the village of Hathersage, about six miles from Castleton,  in Derbyshire, is Little John's grave. Tradition states, some curious  person caused it to be opened, when there were found several bones of  uncommon size, which he preserved; but meeting afterwards with  many unlucky accidents, he carefully replaced them, partly at the  intercession of the sexton who had taken them up for him, and who had  in like manner been visited with misfortunes, but upon restoring  the bones all these troubles ceased. Secondly, by Scotland. In  Murray-land, according to the historian, Hector Boece, is \"the  Kirke of Pette, quhare the banis of Lytill Johne remainis in grete  admiratioun of pepill. He hes bene fourtene feet of hycht with square  membris effering thairto VI zeris,\" continues he, \"afore the cumyng of  this werk to lycht we saw his hanche-bane, als mekill as the hail  bane of ane man, lor we schot our arme in the mouth thairof. Be quhilk  apperis how strang and square pepill grew in our regioun afore they  were effeminat with lust and intemperance of mouth.\" Thirdly, by  Ireland. \"There stood,\" as Stanihurst relates, \"in Ostmantowne greene  an hillocke, named Little John his shot. The occasion,\" he says,  proceeded of this--\"In the yeere one thousand one hundred foure score  and nine, there ranged three robbers and outlaws in England, among  which Robert Hood and Little John weere cheefeteins, of all theeves  doubtlesse the most courteous. Robert Hood being betrayed at a nunrie  in Scotland, called Bricklies, the remnant of the crue was scattered,  and everie man forced to shift for himselfe; whereupon Little John was  faine to flee the realme by sailing to Ireland, where he sojornied  for a few daies at Dublin. The citizens beeing doone to understand the  wandering outcast to be an excellent archer, requested him hartilie to  trie how far he could shoote at random; who yeelding to their behest,  stood on the bridge of Dublin, and shot to that mole hill, leaving  behind him a monument, rather by his posteritie to be woondered, than  possiblie by anie man living to be counterscored. But as the repaire  of so notorious a champion to anie countrie would soone be published,  so his abode could not be long concealed, and therefore to eschew  the danger of laws, he fled into Scotland, where he died at a town or  village called Moravie.\" But, Mr. Walker, after observing, that \"poor  Little John's great practical skill in archery could not save him  from an ignominious fall,\" says \"it appeared from some records in  the Southwell family, that he was publicly executed for robbery on  Arbor-hill, Dublin.\"    A bow, said to have belonged to Little John, with the name of Nayler  upon it, is now in the possession of a gentleman in the West Riding of  Yorkshire.[6] SWAINE.
