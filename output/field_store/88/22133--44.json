This is  the law. Other men rule over territories more vast even than the  Congo. The King of England rules an empire upon which the sun never  sets. But he makes no claim to own it. Against the wishes of even  the humblest crofter, the King would not, because he knows he could  not, enter his cottage. Nor can we imagine even Kaiser William going  into the palm-leaf hut of a charcoal-burner in German East Africa  and saying: \"This is my palm-leaf hut. This is my charcoal. You must  not sell it to the English, or the French, or the American. If they  buy from you they are 'receivers of stolen goods.' To feed my  soldiers you must drag my river for my fish. For me, in my swamp and  in my jungle, you must toil twenty-four days of each month to  gather my rubber. You must not hunt the elephants, for they are my  elephants. Those tusks that fifty years ago your grandfather, with  his naked spear, cut from an elephant, and which you have tried to  hide from me under the floor of this hut, are my ivory. Because that  elephant, running wild through the jungle fifty years ago, belonged  to me. And you yourself are mine, your time is mine, your labor is  mine, your wife, your children, all are mine. They belong to me.\"     [Illustration: \"Tenants\" of Leopold, Who Claims that the Congo   Belongs to Him, and that These Native People Are There Only as His   Tenants.]    This, then, is the \"open door\" as I find it to-day in the Congo. It  is an incredible state of affairs, so insolent, so magnificent in  its impertinence, that it would be humorous, were it not for its  background of misery and suffering, for its hostage houses, its  chain gangs, its _chicottes_, its nameless crimes against the human  body, its baskets of dried hands held up in tribute to the Belgian  blackguard.          III    THE CAPITAL OF THE CONGO      Leopold's \"shop\" has its front door at Banana. Its house flag is a  golden star on a blue background. Banana is the port of entry to the  Congo. You have, no doubt, seen many ports of Europe--Antwerp,  Hamburg, Boulogne, Lisbon, Genoa, Marseilles. Banana is the port of  entry to a country as large as Western Europe, and while the imports  and exports of Europe trickle through all these cities, the commerce  of the Congo enters and departs entirely at Banana. You can then  picture the busy harbor, the jungle of masts, the white bridges and  awnings of the steamers. By the fat funnels and the flags you can  distinguish the English tramps, the German merchantmen, the French,  Dutch, Italian, Portuguese traders, the smart \"liners\" from  Liverpool, even the Arab dhows with bird-wing sails, even the steel,  four-masted schooners out of Boston, U.S.A. You can imagine the  toiling lighters, the slap-dash tenders, the launches with shrieking  whistles.    Of course, you suspect it is not a bit like that. But were it for  fourteen countries the \"open door\" to twenty millions of people,  that is how it might look.    Instead, it is the private entrance to the preserves of a private  individual. So what you really see is, on the one hand, islands of  mangrove bushes, with their roots in the muddy water; on the other,  Banana, a strip of sand and palm trees without a wharf, quay,  landing stage, without a pier to which you could make fast anything  larger than a rowboat.    In a canoe naked natives paddle alongside to sell fish; a peevish  little man in a sun hat, who, in order to save Leopold three  salaries, holds four port offices, is being rowed to the gangway; on  shore the only other visible inhabitant of Banana, a man with no  nerves, is disturbing the brooding, sweating silence by knocking the  rust off the plates of a stranded mud-scow. Welcome to our city!  Welcome to busy, bustling Banana, the port of entry of the Congo  Free State.     [Illustration: The Facilities for Landing at Banana, the Port of   Entry to the Congo, Are Limited.]    In a canoe we were paddled to the back yard of the cafe of Madame  Samuel, and from that bower of warm beer and sardine tins trudged  through the sun up one side of Banana and down the other. In between  the two paths were the bungalows and gardens of forty white men and  two white women. Many of the gardens, as was most of Banana, were  neglected, untidy, littered with condensed-milk tins. Others, more  carefully tended, were laid out in rigid lines. With all tropical  nature to draw upon, nothing had been imagined. The most ambitious  efforts were designs in whitewashed shells and protruding beer  bottles. We could not help remembering the gardens in Japan, of the  poorest and the most ignorant coolies. Do I seem to find fault with  Banana out of all proportion to its importance? It is because  Banana, the Congo's most advanced post of civilization, is typical  of all that lies beyond.    From what I had read of the Congo I expected a broad sweep of muddy,  malaria-breeding water, lined by low-lying swamp lands, gloomy,  monotonous, depressing.    But on the way to Boma and, later, when I travelled on the Upper  Congo, I thought the river more beautiful than any great river I had  ever seen. It was full of wonderful surprises. Sometimes it ran  between palm-covered banks of yellow sand as low as those of the  Mississippi or the Nile; and again, in half an hour, the banks were  rock and as heavily wooded as the mountains of Montana, or as white  and bold as the cliffs of Dover, or we passed between great hills,  covered with what looked like giant oaks, and with their peaks  hidden in the clouds. I found it like no other river, because in  some one particular it was like them all. Between Banana and Boma  the banks first screened us in with the tangled jungle of the  tropics, and then opened up great wind-swept plateaux, leading to  hills that suggested--of all places--England, and, at that,  cultivated England. The contour of the hills, the shape of the  trees, the shade of their green contrasted with the green of the  grass, were like only the cliffs above Plymouth. One did not look  for native kraals and the wild antelope, but for the square,  ivy-topped tower of the village church, the loaf-shaped hayricks,  slow-moving masses of sheep. But this that looks like a pasture  land is only coarse limestone covered with bitter, unnutritious  grass, which benefits neither beast nor man.    At sunset we anchored in the current three miles from Boma, and at  daybreak we tied up to the iron wharf. As the capital of the  government Boma contains the residence and gardens of the governor,  who is the personal representative of Leopold, both as a shopkeeper  and as a king by divine right. He is a figurehead. The real  administrator is M. Vandamme, the Secretaire-General, the  ubiquitous, the mysterious, whose name before you leave Southampton  is in the air, of whom all men, whether they speak in French or  English, speak well. It is from Boma that M. Vandamme sends  collectors of rubber, politely labeled inspecteurs, directeurs,  judges, capitaines, and sous-lieutenants to their posts, and  distributes them over one million square miles.    Boma is the capital of a country which is as large as six nations of  the European continent. For twenty-five years it has been the  capital. Therefore, the reader already guesses that Boma has only  one wharf, and at that wharf there is no custom-house, no warehouse,  not even a canvas awning under which, during the six months of rainy  season, one might seek shelter for himself and his baggage.    Our debarkation reminded me of a landing of filibusters. A wharf  forty yards long led from the steamer to the bank. Down this marched  the officers of the army, the clerks, the bookkeepers, and on the  bank and in the street each dumped his boxes, his sword, his  camp-bed, his full-dress helmet. It looked as though a huge eviction  had taken place, as though a retreating army, having gained the  river's edge, were waiting for a transport. It was not as though to  the government the coming of these gentlemen was a complete  surprise; regularly every three weeks at that exact spot a like  number disembark. But in years the State has not found it worth  while to erect for them even an open zinc shed. The cargo invoiced  to the State is given equal consideration.    \"Prisoners of the State,\" each wearing round his neck a steel ring  from which a chain stretches to the ring of another \"prisoner,\"  carried the cargo to the open street, where lay the luggage of the  officers, and there dropped it. Mingled with steamer chairs, tin  bathtubs, gun-cases, were great crates of sheet iron, green boxes of  gin, bags of Teneriffe potatoes, boilers of an engine. Upon the  scene the sun beat with vicious, cruel persistence. Those officers  who had already served in the Congo dropped their belongings under  the shadow of a solitary tree. Those who for the first time were  seeing the capital of the country they had sworn to serve sank upon  their boxes and, with dismay in their eyes, mopped their red and  dripping brows.     [Illustration: \"Prisoners\" of the State in Chains at Matadi.]    Boma is built at the foot of a hill of red soil. It is a town of  scattered buildings made of wood and sheet-iron plates, sent out in  crates, and held together with screws. To Boma nature has been  considerate. She has contributed many trees, two or three long  avenues of palms, and in the many gardens caused flowers to blossom  and flourish. In the report of the \"Commission of Enquiry\" which  Leopold was forced to send out in 1904 to investigate the  atrocities, and each member of which, for his four months' work,  received $20,000, Boma is described as possessing \"the daintiness  and _chic_ of a European watering-place.\"    Boma really is like a seaport of one of the Central"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#7)"],[1,"all parts of duty,\" said Lear. \"Goneril, I  will not trouble you further--yet I have left another daughter.\"    And his horses being saddled, he set out with his followers for the  castle of Regan. But she, who had formerly outdone her sister in  professions of attachment to the King, now seemed to outdo her in  undutiful conduct, saying that fifty knights were too many to wait on  him, and Goneril (who had hurried thither to prevent Regan showing any  kindness to the old King) said five were too many, since her servants  could wait on him.    Then when Lear saw that what they really wanted was to drive him away,  he left them. It was a wild and stormy night, and he wandered about the  heath half mad with misery, and with no companion but the poor Fool.  But presently his servant, the good Earl of Kent, met him, and at last  persuaded him to lie down in a wretched little hovel. At daybreak the  Earl of Kent removed his royal master to Dover, and hurried to the Court  of France to tell Cordelia what had happened.    Cordelia's husband gave her an army and with it she landed at Dover.  Here she found poor King Lear, wandering about the fields, wearing a  crown of nettles and weeds. They brought him back and fed and clothed  him, and Cordelia came to him and kissed him.    \"You must bear with me,\" said Lear; \"forget and forgive. I am old and  foolish.\"    And now he knew at last which of his children it was that had loved him  best, and who was worthy of his love.    Goneril and Regan joined their armies to fight Cordelia's army, and were  successful; and Cordelia and her father were thrown into prison. Then  Goneril's husband, the Duke of Albany, who was a good man, and had not  known how wicked his wife was, heard the truth of the whole story; and  when Goneril found that her husband knew her for the wicked woman she  was, she killed herself, having a little time before given a deadly  poison to her sister, Regan, out of a spirit of jealousy.    But they had arranged that Cordelia should be hanged in prison, and  though the Duke of Albany sent messengers at once, it was too late. The  old King came staggering into the tent of the Duke of Albany, carrying  the body of his dear daughter Cordelia, in his arms.    And soon after, with words of love for her upon his lips, he fell with  her still in his arms, and died.          TWELFTH NIGHT        Orsino, the Duke of Illyria, was deeply in love with a beautiful  Countess named Olivia. Yet was all his love in vain, for she disdained  his suit; and when her brother died, she sent back a messenger from the  Duke, bidding him tell his master that for seven years she would not  let the very air behold her face, but that, like a nun, she would walk  veiled; and all this for the sake of a dead brother's love, which she  would keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance.    The Duke longed for someone to whom he could tell his sorrow, and repeat  over and over again the story of his love. And chance brought him such a  companion. For about this time a goodly ship was wrecked on the Illyrian  coast, and among those who reached land in safety were the captain and  a fair young maid, named Viola. But she was little grateful for being  rescued from the perils of the sea, since she feared that her twin  brother was drowned, Sebastian, as dear to her as the heart in her  bosom, and so like her that, but for the difference in their manner of  dress, one could hardly be told from the other. The captain, for her  comfort, told her that he had seen her brother bind himself \"to a strong  mast that lived upon the sea,\" and that thus there was hope that he  might be saved.    Viola now asked in whose country she was, and learning that the young  Duke Orsino ruled there, and was as noble in his nature as in his name,  she decided to disguise herself in male attire, and seek for employment  with him as a page.    In this she succeeded, and now from day to day she had to listen to the  story of Orsino's love. At first she sympathized very truly with him,  but soon her sympathy grew to love. At last it occurred to Orsino that  his hopeless love-suit might prosper better if he sent this pretty lad  to woo Olivia for him. Viola unwillingly went on this errand, but when  she came to the house, Malvolio, Olivia's steward, a vain, officious  man, sick, as his mistress told him, of self-love, forbade the messenger  admittance.    Viola, however (who was now called Cesario), refused to take any denial,  and vowed to have speech with the Countess. Olivia, hearing how her  instructions were defied and curious to see this daring youth, said,  \"We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.\"    When Viola was admitted to her presence and the servants had been sent  away, she listened patiently to the reproaches which this bold messenger  from the Duke poured upon her, and listening she fell in love with the  supposed Cesario; and when Cesario had gone, Olivia longed to send some  love-token after him. So, calling Malvolio, she bade him follow the boy.    \"He left this ring behind him,\" she said, taking one from her finger.  \"Tell him I will none of it.\"    Malvolio did as he was bid, and then Viola, who of course knew perfectly  well that she had left no ring behind her, saw with a woman's quickness  that Olivia loved her. Then she went back to the Duke, very sad at heart  for her lover, and for Olivia, and for herself.    It was but cold comfort she could give Orsino, who now sought to ease  the pangs of despised love by listening to sweet music, while Cesario  stood by his side.    \"Ah,\" said the Duke to his page that night, \"you too have been in love.\"    \"A little,\" answered Viola.    \"What kind of woman is it?\" he asked.    \"Of your complexion,\" she answered.    \"What years, i' faith?\" was his next question.    To this came the pretty answer, \"About your years, my lord.\"    \"Too old, by Heaven!\" cried the Duke. \"Let still the woman take an elder  than herself.\"    And Viola very meekly said, \"I think it well, my lord.\"    By and by Orsino begged Cesario once more to visit Olivia and to plead  his love-suit. But she, thinking to dissuade him, said--    \"If some lady loved you as you love Olivia?\"    \"Ah! that cannot be,\" said the Duke.    \"But I know,\" Viola went on, \"what love woman may have for a man. My  father had a daughter loved a man, as it might be,\" she added blushing,  \"perhaps, were I a woman, I should love your lordship.\"    \"And what is her history?\" he asked.    \"A blank, my lord,\" Viola answered. \"She never told her love, but let  concealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek: she  pined in thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat, like  Patience on a monument, smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?\"    \"But died thy sister of her love, my boy?\" the Duke asked; and Viola,  who had all the time been telling her own love for him in this pretty  fashion, said--    \"I am all the daughters my father has and all the brothers-- Sir, shall  I go to the lady?\"    \"To her in haste,\" said the Duke, at once forgetting all about the  story, \"and give her this jewel.\"    So Viola went, and this time poor Olivia was unable to hide her love,  and openly confessed it with such passionate truth, that Viola left her  hastily, saying--    \"Nevermore will I deplore my master's tears to you.\"    But in vowing this, Viola did not know the tender pity she would feel  for other's suffering. So when Olivia, in the violence of her love,  sent a messenger, praying Cesario to visit her once more, Cesario had no  heart to refuse the request.    But the favors which Olivia bestowed upon this mere page aroused the  jealousy of Sir Andrew Aguecheek, a foolish, rejected lover of hers, who  at that time was staying at her house with her merry old uncle Sir Toby.  This same Sir Toby dearly loved a practical joke, and knowing Sir Andrew  to be an arrant coward, he thought that if he could bring off a duel  between him and Cesario, there would be rare sport indeed. So he induced  Sir Andrew to send a challenge, which he himself took to Cesario. The  poor page, in great terror, said--    \"I will return again to the house, I am no fighter.\"    \"Back you shall not to the house,\" said Sir Toby, \"unless you fight me  first.\"    And as he looked a very fierce old gentleman, Viola thought it best to  await Sir Andrew's coming; and when he at last made his appearance, in  a great fright, if the truth had been known, she tremblingly drew her  sword, and Sir Andrew in like fear followed her example. Happily for  them both, at this moment some officers of the Court came on the scene,  and stopped the intended duel. Viola gladly made off with what speed she  might, while Sir Toby called after her--    \"A very paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare!\"    Now, while these things were happening, Sebastian had escaped all  the dangers of the deep, and had landed safely in Illyria, where he  determined to make his way to the Duke's Court. On his way thither he  passed Olivia's house just as Viola had left it in such a hurry, and  whom should he meet but Sir Andrew and Sir Toby. Sir Andrew, mistaking  Sebastian for the cowardly Cesario, took his courage in both hands, and  walking up to him struck him, saying, \"There's for you.\"    \"Why, there's for you; and there, and there!\" said Sebastian, bitting  back a great deal harder, and again and again, till Sir Toby came to  the rescue of his friend. Sebastian, however, tore himself free from Sir  Toby's clutches, and drawing his sword would have fought them both, but  that Olivia herself, having heard of the quarrel, came running in, and  with many reproaches sent Sir Toby and his friend away. Then turning  to Sebastian, whom she too thought to be Cesario, she besought him with  many a pretty speech to come into the house with her.    Sebastian, half dazed and all delighted with her beauty and grace,  readily consented, and that very day, so great was"]]]
