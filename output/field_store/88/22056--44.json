It is now  generally believed that the close of the Brahma@na period was not later  than 500 B.C.      The Ara@nyakas.    As a further development of the Brahma@nas however we get the Ara@nyakas  or forest treatises. These works were probably composed for old men who  had retired into the forest and were thus unable to perform elaborate  sacrifices requiring a multitude of accessories and articles which could  not be procured in forests. In these, meditations on certain symbols  were supposed to be of great merit, and they gradually began to supplant  the sacrifices as being of a superior order. It is here that we find  that amongst a certain section of intelligent people the ritualistic ideas  began to give way, and philosophic speculations about the nature of  truth became gradually substituted in their place. To take an  illustration from the beginning of the B@rhadara@nyaka we find that  instead of the actual performance of the horse sacrifice (_as'vamedha_)  there are directions for meditating upon the dawn (_U@sas_) as the head  of the horse, the sun as the eye of the horse, the air as its life, and  so on. This is indeed a distinct advancement of the claims of speculation  or meditation over the actual performance of the complicated ceremonials  of sacrifice. The growth of the subjective speculation, as being capable  of bringing the highest good, gradually resulted in the supersession of  Vedic ritualism and the establishment of the claims of philosophic  meditation and self-knowledge as the highest goal of life. Thus  we find that the Ara@nyaka age was a period during which free thinking  tried gradually to shake off the shackles of ritualism which had fettered  it for a long time. It was thus that the Ara@nyakas could pave the way  for the Upani@sads, revive the germs of philosophic speculation in the  Vedas, and develop them in a manner which made the Upani@sads the source  of all philosophy that arose in the world of Hindu thought.      The @Rg-Veda, its civilization.    The hymns of the @Rg-Veda are neither the productions of a  single hand nor do they probably belong to any single age. They  were composed probably at different periods by different sages,  and it is not improbable that some of them were composed    15    before the Aryan people entered the plains of India. They were handed  down from mouth to mouth and gradually swelled through the new additions  that were made by the poets of succeeding generations. It was when the  collection had increased to a very considerable extent that it was  probably arranged in the present form, or in some other previous forms  to which the present arrangement owes its origin. They therefore reflect  the civilization of the Aryan people at different periods of antiquity  before and after they had come to India. This unique monument of a long  vanished age is of great aesthetic value, and contains much that is  genuine poetry. It enables us to get an estimate of the primitive  society which produced it--the oldest book of the Aryan race.  The principal means of sustenance were cattle-keeping and the  cultivation of the soil with plough and harrow, mattock and hoe,  and watering the ground when necessary with artificial canals.  \"The chief food consists,\" as Kaegi says, \"together with bread,  of various preparations of milk, cakes of flour and butter, many  sorts of vegetables and fruits; meat cooked on the spits or in pots,  is little used, and was probably eaten only at the great feasts and  family gatherings. Drinking plays throughout a much more important  part than eating [Footnote ref 1].\" The wood-worker built war-chariots  and wagons, as also more delicate carved works and artistic cups.  Metal-workers, smiths and potters continued their trade. The  women understood the plaiting of mats, weaving and sewing;  they manufactured the wool of the sheep into clothing for men  and covering for animals. The group of individuals forming a  tribe was the highest political unit; each of the different families  forming a tribe was under the sway of the father or the head of  the family. Kingship was probably hereditary and in some cases  electoral. Kingship was nowhere absolute, but limited by the  will of the people. Most developed ideas of justice, right and  law, were present in the country. Thus Kaegi says, \"the hymns  strongly prove how deeply the prominent minds in the people  were persuaded that the eternal ordinances of the rulers of the  world were as inviolable in mental and moral matters as in the  realm of nature, and that every wrong act, even the unconscious,  was punished and the sin expiated.\"[Footnote ref 2] Thus it is only right  and proper to think that the Aryans had attained a pretty high degree    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, 1886 edition, p. 13.]    [Footnote 2: _Ibid_. p. 18.]    16    of civilization, but nowhere was the sincere spirit of the Aryans  more manifested than in religion, which was the most essential and  dominant feature of almost all the hymns, except a few secular  ones. Thus Kaegi says, \"The whole significance of the Rigveda  in reference to the general history of religion, as has repeatedly  been pointed out in modern times, rests upon this, that it presents  to us the development of religious conceptions from the earliest  beginnings to the deepest apprehension of the godhead and its  relation to man [Footnote ref 1].\"      The Vedic Gods.    The hymns of the @Rg-Veda were almost all composed in  praise of the gods. The social and other materials are of secondary  importance, as these references had only to be mentioned incidentally  in giving vent to their feelings of devotion to the god.  The gods here are however personalities presiding over the diverse  powers of nature or forming their very essence. They have  therefore no definite, systematic and separate characters like the  Greek gods or the gods of the later Indian mythical works, the  Pura@nas. The powers of nature such as the storm, the rain, the  thunder, are closely associated with one another, and the gods  associated with them are also similar in character. The same  epithets are attributed to different gods and it is only in a few  specific qualities that they differ from one another. In the later  mythological compositions of the Pura@nas the gods lost their  character as hypostatic powers of nature, and thus became actual  personalities and characters having their tales of joy and sorrow  like the mortal here below. The Vedic gods may be contrasted  with them in this, that they are of an impersonal nature, as the  characters they display are mostly but expressions of the powers  of nature. To take an example, the fire or Agni is described, as  Kaegi has it, as one that \"lies concealed in the softer wood, as  in a chamber, until, called forth by the rubbing in the early  morning hour, he suddenly springs forth in gleaming brightness.  The sacrificer takes and lays him on the wood. When the priests  pour melted butter upon him, he leaps up crackling and neighing  like a horse--he whom men love to see increasing like their own  prosperity. They wonder at him, when, decking himself with    ___________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: _The Rigveda_, by Kaegi, p. 26.]    17    changing colors like a suitor, equally beautiful on all sides, he  presents to all sides his front.       \"All-searching is his beam, the gleaming of his light,     His, the all-beautiful, of beauteous face and glance,     The changing shimmer like that floats upon the stream,     So Agni's rays gleam over bright and never cease.\"    [Footnote ref 1] R.V.I. 143. 3.    They would describe the wind (Vata) and adore him and say       \"In what place was he born, and from whence comes he?     The vital breath of gods, the world's great offspring,     The God where'er he will moves at his pleasure:     His rushing sound we hear--what his appearance, no one.\"    [Footnote ref 2] R.V.X. 168. 3, 4.    It was the forces of nature and her manifestations, on earth  here, the atmosphere around and above us, or in the Heaven  beyond the vault of the sky that excited the devotion and  imagination of the Vedic poets. Thus with the exception of a  few abstract gods of whom we shall presently speak and some  dual divinities, the gods may be roughly classified as the  terrestrial, atmospheric, and celestial.      Polytheism, Henotheism and Monotheism.    The plurality of the Vedic gods may lead a superficial enquirer  to think the faith of the Vedic people polytheistic. But an intelligent  reader will find here neither polytheism nor monotheism but a simple  primitive stage of belief to which both of these may be said to owe  their origin. The gods here do not preserve their proper places as in  a polytheistic faith, but each one of them shrinks into insignificance  or shines as supreme according as it is the object of adoration or not.  The Vedic poets were the children of nature. Every natural phenomenon  excited their wonder, admiration or veneration. The poet is struck  with wonder that \"the rough red cow gives soft white milk.\" The appearance  or the setting of the sun sends a thrill into the minds of the Vedic  sage and with wonder-gazing eyes he exclaims:       \"Undropped beneath, not fastened firm, how comes it     That downward turned he falls not downward?     The guide of his ascending path,--who saw it?\"    [Footnote Ref 1] R.V. IV. 13. 5.

Yes, she had linked her destiny to such a man,  and now she felt the full import of the vow she had made, of the  pledge she had taken. She had done so wittingly, knowingly, with  consideration; but not until that moment had the full force of her  position burst upon her.    \"Dumiger,\" she again whispered in the small, still voice of love;  bending her lips to his hand at the same time,--\"Dumiger!\"    There was silence, for he slept.    But slowly, as though by a secret sympathy, he awoke to consciousness:  he looked wildly around the room, and then turned a keen, earnest gaze  on the form near him.    \"Marguerite, my love,\" he said gently, and then he put his arm around  her waist, and pressed his lips to hers, \"you promised me, Marguerite,  that you would let me toil through this night.\"    \"So I did, Dumiger,\" she replied; \"but I felt nervous and wretched; I  could not sleep: besides, look out, the night is already passed, it is  quite morning, and very chilly too,\" she said, as she drew her shawl  closer round her bosom.    \"Yes, you will catch cold, my darling. Leave me.\"    \"And you, Dumiger, will you remain here, poring over these volumes,  and torturing your brains? I am sure, that you will succeed far more  easily (for I never doubt your success, but lament the price you will  have to pay for it), you will succeed far better by giving yourself  more rest, and working by day instead of night; your cheek is quite  pale. Dumiger: now, in your boyhood, you have lines marked on your  forehead which in others are the result of pain and toil. Your eyes  have lost--\"    She was about to add, \"their brightness,\" when as though a sudden ray  of light had flashed through them, they gleamed with even more than  their wonted intelligence.    \"Marguerite, Marguerite,\" he exclaimed, clasping her in his arms, \"you  know not what you are saying. Look here!\" and he rose hurriedly from  his seat and drew her toward the window; \"do you see that star in the  east, how bright it is, that you can even distinguish the ray it sheds  from the gray light which breaks from behind those masses of clouds?  By that light I tell you I shall succeed in my most extravagant  expectations. How many anxious nights I have waited for that  star! Until I saw it I had no hope--now, my hope can scarcely find  expression. I am grateful to Thee, O Providence, for this revelation,  for the accomplishment of all my wishes;\" and he bowed his head as  though in adoration, and almost sank on his knees.    Marguerite looked at him as if she dreaded that his brain was turned.  Dumiger interpreted that look; for what look is there that love cannot  interpret?    \"No, Marguerite, I am not mad, believe me. This toil has not yet  turned my brain, though it might indeed have done so, for it is sad  and hard to labor night after night in pursuit of an object so distant  and yet so prized. You ask me why I labor through the night? Foolish  child! why you must know that the clock for which the city has offered  so extravagant a prize, and to obtain which, not I alone, but so many  others are wasting their health and squandering their youth--you must  know that this clock is not only to tell the hour of the day, and the  month of the year, but to contain within its works the secret of the  movements of the heavenly bodies;--that to obtain this prize they must  read the wonders of the skies, and penetrate its mysteries. It is a  wild and fearful study, Marguerite--a study, the pursuit of which is  not calculated by the hands on the dial-plate. Even now I marvel at  the audacity of the men who proposed such a design, and the boldness  of those who, like myself, have undertaken to fulfill it. You cannot  imagine, Marguerite, how such contemplations remove one from the  world in which we live. Until I knew you, Marguerite, I cared for and  thought of nothing else.\"    \"And even now, Dumiger, is this not the case?\" said she, with a gentle  smile.    \"No, to your love I owe all, Marguerite,\" he answered. \"It seemed  to purify my feelings, to elevate my mind to the height of this vast  argument--until I knew you there was a link wanting in my life. When I  used to ponder on the marvelous love of the Infinite, which could work  out this wondrous system, and give man the faculty and the desire  of comprehending it, I felt that the mind contained capacities long  concealed from its owner; I felt that even in this world there must be  at some time a perfect revelation of perfect love to man, beyond that  love of nature which is to be derived from the study of this world's  natural laws and those of the lights which rule it. I was then  unsatisfied, Marguerite, for there was a void in my heart which  nothing could fill up; and I remember once meeting with a passage in a  favorite author which said, that whosoever had a faculty or sensation  unemployed could not be happy. I was in that situation; but strange to  say, absorbing as the passion of love is, when I once understood this  great mystery I was better able to devote all my energies to science.  I had often heard it said, that a pure and holy affection is the  purest and surest source of energy and greatness--until I knew you,  Marguerite, I gave no credit to the saying.\"    \"And this star, Dumiger, which is growing fainter and fainter?\"    \"It was the one evidence wanting to prove the accuracy of my  calculations. Look here, Marguerite,\" and he rose from the table with  weak and faltering steps, and drew back a curtain which was drawn  across a corner of the small room. There she saw a small clock of  exquisite manufacture, a complicated mass of machinery--so complicated  that it would have looked like fabled labor to have even put it  into motion, or regulated it when in motion. \"Look here,\" continued  Dumiger, \"here is the result of two years' toil. I have already  adapted these works to each other: it is, as you may perceive, a  representation of the heavenly bodies; but I could not satisfy myself  that my own calculations were correct until I saw this star which I  expected to rise as it has risen this morning. Now, Marguerite, my  best beloved, you have seen it burning brightly in that spot of the  heavens, it is a pledge of our future love and of my great success--I  accept it with humility and gratitude. Yes, now. Marguerite, I will  retire with you; a great fact has been accomplished. If labor is  virtuous, if to exercise the faculties be a part of the discipline  of life, then, even if I die now, I have not lived unworthily, and my  labor has not been wholly in vain. What think you, my Marguerite?\"    She looked her answer in those dark, speaking, lustrous eyes. The  greatness of his mind had passed to hers; the mysterious sympathy of  kindred souls united them. She was proud of him; and her eyes flashed  lightning, and her cheek flushed deeply, as she replied--    \"I can forgive you now, Dumiger, all your neglect, in the hope of  seeing you famous and honored by all your fellow-townsmen.\"    \"Ay, Marguerite,\" replied Dumiger, \"there it is; it is fame for itself  I care for--to be great, powerful and wealthy, is a matter of but  small importance. One can live without rank, without power, without  wealth, and perhaps be all the happier for wanting them. This little  room, small and ill-furnished though it be, contains in it as much  happiness as any one heart can enjoy. If we have everything we  desire, what care I in how small a compass they may be expressed? For  instance, I would not yield one of your kisses, Marguerite, for all  the palace of the Grand Master can offer. Some of my friends have  richer abodes, but what matter? Where did Van Eyck, who immortalized  himself by that one painting, known throughout Europe as the Dantzic  picture, reside? Why, in one of those wretched buildings, ill  supported by props and pillars, near the Grime Thor, but which his  fellow-townsmen are at this moment prouder of than they are of the  Artimshof or the Stockthurm. How did Andreas Stock live? In obscurity  and penury, without one smile of good fortune to gild the darkness  of existence. But do you suppose that these men were unhappy? Oh no,  Marguerite, to make everything in nature beautiful there is but one  element in nature essential, and that is light. To make everything in  the heart rejoice there is but one sensation essential, it is love.  How think you, Marguerite?\"    Her only reply was a long, long kiss.    And they retired to rest as the bells of the city chimed in the merry  morning, arousing in that city its slumbering passions, fears, loves,  difficulties, and perils, which had been for long hours buried in  sleep. But amid the various sounds which began to echo through the  streets, there was one wanting to give evidence that the dawn, of a  great town was breaking. No clock worthy of the noble Dom, imitated by  Ritter of Strasburg from St. Sophia, arrested the attention of those  who were starting forth on their several pilgrimages of toil or joy:  none had yet been wrought worthy of the mighty majestic pile which  overshadowed the free city, and reared its towers lofty as the great  League to whose wealth it owed its origin. To construct such a clock  was the object for which Dumiger labored; and not he alone, but  hundreds of skilled workmen, toiled anxiously through the long autumn  nights, for the citizens of Dantzic loved that glorious fane whose  lofty towers looked upon their birth, and beneath whose shadow the  noblest of their freemen were buried. To connect their names with  that great monument, seemed to them to be an object well worthy of the  noblest and oldest commercial houses. Two years had been allowed for  the undertaking, and the time for deciding the prize was drawing near;  and amongst all who toiled to win it, none more zealously labored  in the work than Dumiger Lichtnau, known to history as Dumiger of  Dantzic.
