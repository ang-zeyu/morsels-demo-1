He was to furnish  vessels, goods, provisions, arms, ammunition, and all other requisites  for the enterprise at first cost and charges, provided that they did  not, at any time, involve an advance of more than four hundred thousand  dollars.    The stock of the company was to be divided into a hundred equal shares,  with the profits accruing thereon. Fifty shares were to be at the  disposition of Mr. Astor, and the other fifty to be divided among the  partners and their associates.    Mr. Astor was to have the privilege of introducing other persons into  the connection as partners, two of whom, at least, should be conversant  with the Indian trade, and none of them entitled to more than three  shares.    A general meeting of the company was to be held annually at Columbia  River, for the investigation and regulation of its affairs; at which  absent members might be represented, and might vote by proxy under  certain specified conditions.    The association, if successful, was to continue for twenty years; but  the parties had full power to abandon and dissolve it within the first  five years, should it be found unprofitable. For this term Mr. Astor  covenanted to bear all the loss that might be incurred; after which it  was to be borne by all the partners, in proportion to their respective  shares.    The parties of the second part were to execute faithfully such duties as  might be assigned to them by a majority of the company on the northwest  coast, and to repair to such place or places as the majority might  direct.    An agent, appointed for the term of five years, was to reside at the  principal establishment on the northwest coast, and Wilson Price Hunt  was the one chosen for the first term. Should the interests of the  concern at any time require his absence, a person was to be appointed,  in general meeting, to take his place.    Such were the leading conditions of this association; we shall now  proceed to relate the various hardy and eventful expeditions, by sea and  land, to which it gave rise.         * Carver's Travels, Introd. b. iii. Philad. 1796.         **Carver's Travels, p. 360.         *** On this point Mr. Jefferson's memory was in error. The       proposition alluded to was the one, already mentioned, for       the establishment of an American Fur Company in the Atlantic       States. The great enterprise beyond the mountains, that was       to sweep the shores of the Pacific, originated in the mind       of Mr. Astor, and was proposed by him to the government.

Two Expeditions Set on Foot.--The Tonquin and Her Crew.--       Captain Thorn, His Character.--The Partners and Clerks--       Canadian Voyageurs, Their Habits, Employments, Dress,       Character, Songs--Expedition of a Canadian Boat and Its Crew       by Land and Water.--Arrival at New York.--Preparations for a       Sea Voyage.--Northwest Braggarts.--Underhand Precautions--       Letter of Instructions.    IN prosecuting his great scheme of commerce and colonization, two  expeditions were devised by Mr. Astor, one by sea, the other by  land. The former was to carry out the people, stores, ammunition, and  merchandise, requisite for establishing a fortified trading post at  the mouth of Columbia River. The latter, conducted by Mr. Hunt, was to  proceed up the Missouri, and across the Rocky Mountains, to the same  point; exploring a line of communication across the continent and  noting the places where interior trading posts might be established. The  expedition by sea is the one which comes first under consideration.    A fine ship was provided called the Tonquin, of two hundred and ninety  tons burden, mounting ten guns, with a crew of twenty men. She carried  an assortment of merchandise for trading with the natives of the  seaboard and of the interior, together with the frame of a schooner,  to be employed in the coasting trade. Seeds also were provided for the  cultivation of the soil, and nothing was neglected for the necessary  supply of the establishment. The command of the ship was intrusted to  Jonathan Thorn, of New York, a lieutenant in the United States navy,  on leave of absence. He was a man of courage and firmness, who had  distinguished himself in our Tripolitan war, and, from being accustomed  to naval discipline, was considered by Mr. Astor as well fitted to take  charge of an expedition of the kind. Four of the partners were to embark  in the ship, namely, Messrs. M'Kay, M'Dougal, David Stuart, and his  nephew, Robert Stuart. Mr. M'Dougal was empowered by Mr. Astor to act as  his proxy in the absence of Mr. Hunt, to vote for him and in his name,  on any question that might come before any meeting of the persons  interested in the voyage.    Besides the partners, there were twelve clerks to go out in the ship,  several of them natives of Canada, who had some experience in the Indian  trade. They were bound to the service of the company for five years, at  the rate of one hundred dollars a year, payable at the expiration of  the term, and an annual equipment of clothing to the amount of forty  dollars. In case of ill conduct they were liable to forfeit their wages  and be dismissed; but, should they acquit themselves well, the confident  expectation was held out to them of promotion, and partnership. Their  interests were thus, to some extent, identified with those of the  company.    Several artisans were likewise to sail in the ship, for the supply of  the colony; but the most peculiar and characteristic part of this motley  embarkation consisted of thirteen Canadian \"voyageurs,\" who had enlisted  for five years. As this class of functionaries will continually recur  in the course of the following narrations, and as they form one of those  distinct and strongly marked castes or orders of people, springing up  in this vast continent out of geographical circumstances, or the varied  pursuits, habitudes, and origins of its population, we shall sketch a  few of their characteristics for the information of the reader.    The \"voyageurs\" form a kind of confraternity in the Canadas, like the  arrieros, or carriers of Spain, and, like them, are employed in long  internal expeditions of travel and traffic: with this difference, that  the arrieros travel by land, the voyageurs by water; the former with  mules and horses, the latter with batteaux and canoes. The voyageurs may  be said to have sprung up out of the fur trade, having originally been  employed by the early French merchants in their trading expeditions  through the labyrinth of rivers and lakes of the boundless interior.  They were coeval with the coureurs des bois, or rangers of the woods,  already noticed, and, like them, in the intervals of their long,  arduous, and laborious expeditions, were prone to pass their time in  idleness and revelry about the trading posts or settlements; squandering  their hard earnings in heedless conviviality, and rivaling their  neighbors, the Indians, in indolent indulgence and an imprudent  disregard of the morrow.    When Canada passed under British domination, and the old French trading  houses were broken up, the voyageurs, like the coureurs des bois, were  for a time disheartened and disconsolate, and with difficulty could  reconcile themselves to the service of the new-comers, so different in  habits, manners, and language from their former employers. By degrees,  however, they became accustomed to the change, and at length came to  consider the British fur traders, and especially the members of the  Northwest Company, as the legitimate lords of creation.    The dress of these people is generally half civilized, half savage.  They wear a capot or surcoat, made of a blanket, a striped cotton shirt,  cloth trousers, or leathern leggins, moccasins of deer-skin, and a  belt of variegated worsted, from which are suspended the knife,  tobacco-pouch, and other implements. Their language is of the same  piebald character, being a French patois, embroidered with Indian and  English words and phrases.    The lives of the voyageurs are passed in wild and extensive rovings, in  the service of individuals, but more especially of the fur traders.  They are generally of French descent, and inherit much of the gayety and  lightness of heart of their ancestors, being full of anecdote and song,  and ever ready for the dance. They inherit, too, a fund of civility and  complaisance; and, instead of that hardness and grossness which men in  laborious life are apt to indulge towards each other, they are mutually  obliging and accommodating; interchanging kind offices, yielding each  other assistance and comfort in every emergency, and using the familiar  appellations of \"cousin\" and \"brother\" when there is in fact no  relationship. Their natural good-will is probably heightened by a  community of adventure and hardship in their precarious and wandering  life.    No men are more submissive to their leaders and employers, more capable  of enduring hardship, or more good-humored under privations. Never are  they so happy as when on long and rough expeditions, toiling up rivers  or coasting lakes; encamping at night on the borders, gossiping round  their fires, and bivouacking in the open air. They are dextrous boatmen,  vigorous and adroit with the oar and paddle, and will row from  morning until night without a murmur. The steersman often sings an old  traditionary French song, with some regular burden in which they all  join, keeping time with their oars; if at any time they flag in spirits  or relax in exertion, it is but necessary to strike up a song of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13711"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#7)"],[1," person of low degree, dressed in a coarse woollen gown, and a plain  _Mutch_ cap, clasped under the chin with a silver brooch, which her  father had worn at the battle of Culloden.\" Of course she filled with  tales of Sir William Wallace and the Bruce the listening ears of the  lovely Saxon child, who treasured them in her heart and brain, until  they fructified in after years into \"The Scottish Chiefs.\" To these  two were added \"The Pastor's Fireside,\" and a number of other tales  and romances. She contributed to several annuals and magazines, and  always took pains to keep up the reputation she had won, achieving  a large share of the popularity, to which, as an author, she never  looked for happiness. No one could be more alive to praise or more  grateful for attention, but the heart of a genuine, pure, loving  woman, beat within Jane Porter's bosom, and she was never drawn out of  her domestic circle by the flattery that has spoiled so many, men as  well as women. Her mind was admirably balanced by her home affections,  which remained unsullied and unshaken to the end of her days. She  had, in common with her three brothers and her charming sister, the  advantage of a wise and loving mother--a woman pious without cant, and  worldly-wise without being worldly. Mrs. Porter was born at Durham,  and when very young bestowed her hand and heart on Major Porter.  An old friend of the family assures us that two or three of their  children were born in Ireland, and that certainly Jane was amongst the  number. Although she left Ireland when in early youth, perhaps almost  an infant, she certainly must be considered Irish, as her father was  so both by birth and descent, and esteemed during his brief life as a  brave and generous gentleman. He died young, leaving his lovely widow  in straitened circumstances, having only her widow's pension to depend  on. The eldest son--afterward Colonel Porter--was sent to school by  his grandfather.    We have glanced briefly at Sir Robert Ker Porter's wonderful  talents, and Anna Maria, when in her twelfth year, rushed, as  Jane acknowledged, \"prematurely into print.\" Of Anna Maria we knew  personally but very little, enough however to recall with a pleasant  memory her readiness in conversation and her bland and cheerful  manners. No two sisters could have been more different in bearing and  appearance; Maria was a delicate blonde, with a _riant_ face, and  an animated manner--we had said almost _peculiarly Irish_--rushing  at conclusions, where her more thoughtful and careful sister paused  to consider and calculate. The beauty of Jane was statuesque, her  deportment serious yet cheerful, a seriousness quite as natural as  her younger sister's gaiety; they both labored diligently, but Anna  Maria's labor was sport when compared to her eldest sister's careful  toil; Jane's mind was of a more lofty order, she was intense, and felt  more than she said, while Anna Maria often said more than she felt;  they were a delightful contrast, and yet the harmony between them was  complete; and one of the happiest days we ever spent, while trembling  on the threshold of literature, was with them at their pretty  road-side cottage in the village of Esher before the death of their  venerable and dearly beloved mother, whose rectitude and prudence had  both guided and sheltered their youth, and who lived to reap with  them the harvest of their industry and exertion. We remember the drive  there, and the anxiety as to how those very \"clever ladies\" would  look, and what they would say; we talked over the various letters  we had received from Jane, and thought of the cordial invitation to  their cottage--their \"mother's cottage\"--as they always called it. We  remember the old white friendly spaniel who looked at us with blinking  eyes, and preceded us up stairs; we remember the formal old-fashioned  courtesy of the venerable old lady, who was then nearly eighty--the  blue ribands and good-natured frankness of Anna Maria, and the noble  courtesy of Jane, who received visitors as if she granted an audience;  this manner was natural to her; it was only the manner of one whose  thoughts have dwelt more upon heroic deeds, and lived more with heroes  than with actual living men and women; the effect of this, however,  soon passed away, but not so the fascination which was in all she  said and did. Her voice was soft and musical, and her conversation  addressed to one person rather than to the company at large, while  Maria talked rapidly to every one, or _for_ every one who chose to  listen. How happily the hours passed!--we were shown some of those  extraordinary drawings of Sir Robert, who gained an artists reputation  before he was twenty, and attracted the attention of West and Shee[2]  in his mere boyhood. We heard all the interesting particulars of his  panoramic picture of the Storming of Seringapatam, which, the first  of its class, was known half over the world. We must not, however,  be misunderstood--there was neither personal nor family egotism in  the Porters; they invariably spoke of each other with the tenderest  affection--but unless the conversation was _forced_ by their  friends--they never mentioned their own, or each other's works, while  they were most ready to praise what was excellent in the works of  others; they spoke with pleasure of their sojourns in London; while  their mother said, it was much wiser and better for young ladies  who were not rich, to live quietly in the country, and escape the  temptations of luxury and display. At that time the \"young ladies\"  seemed to us certainly _not_ young: that was about two-and-twenty  years ago, and Jane Porter was seventy-five when she died. They talked  much of their previous dwelling at Thames Ditton, of the pleasant  neighborhood they enjoyed there, though their mother's health and  their own had much improved since their residence on Esher hill;  their little garden was bounded at the back by the beautiful park of  Claremont, and the front of the house overlooked the leading roads,  broken as they are by the village green, and some noble elms. The view  is crowned by the high trees of Esher Place; opening from the village  on that side of the brow of the hill. Jane pointed out the _locale_  of the proud Cardinal Wolsey's domain, inhabited during the days: of  his power over Henry VIII., and in their cloudy evening, when that  capricious monarch's favor changed to bitterest hate. It was the very  spot to foster her high romance, while she could at the same time  enjoy the sweets of that domestic converse she loved best of all.  We were prevented by the occupations and heart-beatings of our own  literary labors from repeating this visit; and in 1831, four years  after these well-remembered hours, the venerable mother of a family  so distinguished in literature and art, rendering their names known  and honored wherever art and letters flourish, was called HOME. The  sisters, who had resided ten years at Esher, left it, intending to  sojourn for a time with their second brother, Doctor Porter, (who  commenced his career as a surgeon in the navy) in Bristol; but within  a year the youngest, the light-spirited, bright-hearted Anna Maria  died; her sister was dreadfully shaken by her loss, and the letters  we received from her after this bereavement, though containing the  outpourings of a sorrowing spirit, were full of the certainty of  that re-union hereafter which became the hope of her life. She soon  resigned her cottage home at Esher, and found the affectionate welcome  she so well deserved in many homes, where friends vied with each  other to fill the void in her sensitive heart. She was of too wise  a nature, and too sympathizing a habit, to shut out new interests  and affections, but her _old ones_ never withered, nor were they  ever replaced; were the love of such a sister-friend--the watchful  tenderness and uncompromising love of a mother--ever \"replaced,\" to a  lonely sister _or_ a bereaved daughter! Miss Porters pen had been laid  aside for some time, when suddenly she came before the world as the  editor of \"Sir Edward Seward's Narrative\", and set people hunting over  old atlases to find out the island where he resided. The whole was  a clever fiction; yet Miss Porter never confided its authorship, we  believe, beyond her family circle; perhaps the correspondence and  documents, which are in the hands of one of her kindest friends (her  executor), Mr. Shepherd, may throw some light upon a subject which the  \"Quarterly\" honored by an article. We think the editor certainly used  her pen as well as her judgment in the work, and we have imagined that  it might have been written by the family circle, more in sport than in  earnest, and then produced to serve a double purpose.    [Footnote 2: In his early days the President of the Royal Academy  painted a very striking portrait of Jane Porter, as \"Miranda,\"  and Harlowe painted her in the canoness dress of the order of St.  Joachim.]    After her sister's death Miss Jane Porter was afflicted with so  severe an illness, that we, in common with her other friends, thought  it impossible she could carry out her plan of journeying to St.  Petersburgh to visit her brother, Sir Robert Ker Porter, who had  been long united to a Russian princess, and was then a widower; her  strength was fearfully reduced; her once round figure become almost  spectral, and little beyond the placid and dignified expression of  her noble countenance remained to tell of her former beauty; but her  resolve was taken; she wished, she said, to see once more her youngest  and most beloved brother, so distinguished in several careers, almost  deemed incompatible,--as a painter, an author, a soldier, and a  diplomatist, and nothing could turn her from her purpose: she reached  St. Petersburgh in safety, and with apparently improved health, found  her brother as much courted and beloved there as in his own"]]]
