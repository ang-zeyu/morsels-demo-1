The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daughter of one of the  laborers employed by the royal gardener; and she had come to help her  father weed the flower beds. It chanced that, like many of the poor people  in Prussia, she had received a good education. She was somewhat alarmed  when she found herself in the King's presence, but took courage when the  King told her that he only wanted her to read for him, as his eyes were  weak.    7. Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little girl) was fond of  reading aloud, and often many of the neighbors would assemble at her  father's house to hear her; those who could not read themselves would come  to her, also, with their letters from distant friends or children, and she  thus formed the habit of reading various sorts of handwriting promptly and  well.    8. The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly glanced through the  opening lines to get some idea of what it was about. As she read, her eyes  began to glisten, and her breast to heave. \"What is the matter?\" asked the  King; \"don't you know how to read?\" \"Oh, yes! sire,\" she replied,  addressing him with the title usually applied to him: \"I will now read it,  if you please.\"    9. The two pages wore about to leave the room. \"Remain,\" said the King.  The little girl began to read the petition. It was from a poor widow,  whose only son had been drafted to serve in the army, although his health  was delicate and his pursuits had been such as to unfit him for military  life. His father had been killed in battle, and the son had a strong  desire to become a portrait painter.    10. The writer told her story in a simple, concise manner, that carried to  the heart a belief of its truth; and Ernestine read it with so much  feeling, and with an articulation so just, in tones so pure and distinct,  that when she had finished, the King, into whose eyes the tears had  started, exclaimed, \"Oh! now I understand what it is all about; but I  might never have known, certainly I never should have felt, its meaning  had I trusted to these young gentlemen, whom I now dismiss from my service  for one year, advising them to occupy their time in learning to read.\"    11. \"As for you, my young lady,\" continued the King, \"I know you will ask  no better reward for your trouble than the pleasure of carrying to this  poor widow my order for her son's immediate discharge. Let me see whether  you can write as well as you can read. Take this pen, and write as I  dictate.\" He then dictated an order, which Ernestine wrote, and he signed.  Calling one of his guards, he bade him go with the girl and see that the  order was obeyed.    12. How much happiness was Ernestine the means of bestowing through her  good elocution, united to the happy circumstance that brought it to the  knowledge of the King! First, there were her poor neighbors, to whom she  could give instruction and entertainment. Then, there was the poor widow  who sent the petition, and who not only regained her son, but received  through Ernestine an order for him to paint the King's likeness; so that  the poor boy soon rose to great distinction, and had more orders than he  could attend to. Words could not express his gratitude, and that of his  mother, to the little girl.    13. And Ernestine had, moreover, the satisfaction of aiding her father to  rise in the world, so that he became the King's chief gardener. The King  did not forget her, but had her well educated at his own expense. As for  the two pages, she was indirectly the means of doing them good, also; for,  ashamed of their bad reading, they commenced studying in earnest, till  they overcame the faults that had offended the King. Both finally rose to  distinction, one as a lawyer, and the other as a statesman; and they owed  their advancement in life chiefly to their good elocution.      DEFINITIONS.--1.

NOTES.--Frederick II. of Prussia (b. 1712, d. 1788), or Frederick the  Great, as he was called, was one of the greatest of German rulers. He was  distinguished for his military exploits, for his wise and just government,  and for his literary attainments. He wrote many able works in the French  language. Many pleasant anecdotes are told of this king, of which the one  given in the lesson is a fair sample.        II. THE BLUEBELL.    1.  There is a story I have heard--      A poet learned it of a bird,      And kept its music every word--    2.  A story of a dim ravine,      O'er which the towering tree tops lean,      With one blue rift of sky between;    3.  And there, two thousand years ago,      A little flower as white as snow      Swayed in the silence to and fro.    4.  Day after day, with longing eye,      The floweret watched the narrow sky,      And fleecy clouds that floated by.    5.  And through the darkness, night by night,      One gleaming star would climb the height,      And cheer the lonely floweret's sight.    6.  Thus, watching the blue heavens afar,      And the rising of its favorite star,      A slow change came--but not to mar;    7.  For softly o'er its petals white      There crept a blueness, like the light      Of skies upon a summer night;    8.  And in its chalice, I am told,      The bonny bell was formed to hold      A tiny star that gleamed like gold.    9.  Now, little people, sweet and true,      I find a lesson here for you      Writ in the floweret's hell of blue:    10. The patient child whose watchful eye      Strives after all things pure and high,      Shall take their image by and by.       DEFINITIONS.--2. Rift, a narrow opening, a cleft. 3. Swayed, swung. 5.   Height (pro. hite), an elevated place. 7. Pet'als, the colored leaves of   a flower. 8. Chal'ice, a cup or bowl. Bon'ny, beautiful.        III. THE GENTLE HAND.    Timothy S. Arthur (b. 1809, d. 1885) was born near Newburgh, N.Y., but  passed most of his life at Baltimore and Philadelphia. His opportunities  for good schooling were quite limited, and he may be considered a  self-educated man. He was the author of more than a hundred volumes,  principally novels of a domestic and moral tone, and of many shorter  tales--magazine articles, etc. \"Ten Nights in a Barroom,\" and \"Three Years  in a Mantrap,\" are among his best known works.    1. When and where it matters not now to relate--but once upon a time, as I  was passing through a thinly peopled district of country, night came down  upon me almost unawares. Being on foot, I could not hope to gain the  village toward which my steps were directed, until a late hour; and I  therefore preferred seeking shelter and a night's lodging at the first  humble dwelling that presented itself.    2. Dusky twilight was giving place to deeper shadows, when I found myself  in the vicinity of a dwelling, from the small uncurtained windows of which  the light shone with a pleasant promise of good cheer and comfort. The  house stood within an inclosure, and a short distance from the road along  which I was moving with wearied feet.    3. Turning aside, and passing through the ill-hung gate, I approached the  dwelling. Slowly the gate swung on its wooden hinges, and the rattle of  its latch, in closing, did not disturb the air until I had nearly reached  the porch in front of the house, in which a slender girl, who had noticed  my entrance, stood awaiting my arrival.    4. A deep, quick bark answered, almost like an echo, the sound of the  shutting gate, and, sudden as an apparition, the form of an immense dog  loomed in the doorway. At the instant when he was about to spring, a light  hand was laid upon his shaggy neck, and a low word spoken.    5. \"Go in, Tiger,\" said the girl, not in a voice of authority, yet in her  gentle tones was the consciousness that she would be obeyed; and, as she  spoke, she lightly bore upon the animal with her hand, and he turned away  and disappeared within the dwelling.    6. \"Who's that?\" A rough voice asked the question; and now a heavy-looking  man took the dog's place in the door.    7. \"How far is it to G--?\" I asked, not deeming it best to say, in the  beginning, that I sought a resting place for the night.    8. \"To G--!\" growled the man, but not so harshly as at first. \"It's good  six miles from here.\"    9. \"A long distance; and I'm a stranger and on foot,\" said I. \"If you can  make room for me until morning, I will be very thankful.\"    10. I saw the girl's hand move quickly up his arm, until it rested on his  shoulder, and now she leaned to him still closer.    11. \"Come in. We'll try what can be done for you.\" There was a change in  the man's voice that made me wonder. I entered a large room, in which  blazed a brisk fire. Before the fire sat two stout lads, who turned upon  me their heavy eyes, with no very welcome greeting. A middle-aged woman  was standing at a table, and two children were amusing themselves with a  kitten on the floor.    12. \"A stranger, mother,\" said the man who had given me so rude a greeting  at the door; \"and he wants us to let him stay all night.\"    13. The woman looked at me doubtingly for a few moments, and then replied  coldly, \"We don't keep a public house.\"    14. \"I'm aware of that, ma'am,\" said I; \"but night has overtaken me, and  it's a long way yet to G--.\"    15. \"Too far for a tired man to go on foot,\" said the master of the house,  kindly, \"so it's no use talking about it, mother; we must give him a bed.\"      16. So unobtrusively that I scarce noticed the movement, the girl had  drawn to her mother's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15042"],[0,"A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert (#7)"],[1," take the trouble to read my  letter for me, which he readily comply'd with and was greatly moved and  affected at the contents; insomuch that he said he would undertake to  make a gathering for me, which he did and was the first to contribute to  it himself. The money was sent that evening to London by a person who  happen'd to be going there: nor was this All the goodness that I  experienced from these kind friends, for, as soon as my wife came about  and was fit to travel, they sent for her to me, and were at the whole  expence of her coming; so evidently has the love and mercy of God  appeared through every trouble that ever I experienced. We went on very  comfortably all the summer.--We lived in a little cottage near Mr.  _Handbarrar's_ House; but when the winter came on I was discharged, as  he had no further occasion for me. And now the prospect began to darken  upon us again. We thought it most adviseable to move our habitation a  little nearer to the Town, as the house we lived in was very cold, and  wet, and ready to tumble down.    The boundless goodness of GOD to me has been so very great, that with  the most humble gratitude I desire to prostrate myself before Him; for I  have been wonderfully supported in every affliction. My GOD never left  me. I perceived light still through the thickest darkness.    My dear wife and I were now both unemployed, we could get nothing to do.  The winter prov'd remarkably severe, and we were reduc'd to the greatest  distress imaginable.--I was always very shy of asking for any thing; I  could never beg; neither did I chuse to make known our wants to any  person, for fear of offending as we were entire strangers; but our last  bit of bread was gone, and I was obliged to think of something to do for  our support.--I did not mind for myself at all; but to see my dear wife  and children in want pierc'd me to the heart.--I now blam'd myself for  bringing her from London, as doubtless had we continued there we might  have found friends to keep us from starving. The snow was at this season  remarkably deep; so that we could see no prospect of being relieved. In  this melancholy situation, not knowing what step to pursue, I resolved  to make my case known to a Gentleman's Gardiner that lived near us, and  entreat him to employ me: but when I came to him, my courage failed me,  and I was ashamed to make known our real situation.--I endeavoured all I  could to prevail on him to set me to work, but to no purpose: he assur'd  me it was not in his power: but just as I was about to leave him, he  asked me if I would accept of some Carrots? I took them with great  thankfulness and carried them home: he gave me four, they were very  large and fine.--We had nothing to make fire with, so consequently could  not boil them: But was glad to have them to eat _raw_. Our youngest  child was quite an infant; so that my wife was obliged to chew it, and  fed her in that manner for several days.--We allowed ourselves but one  every day, least they should not last 'till we could get some other  supply. I was unwilling to eat at all myself; nor would I take any the  last day that we continued in this situation, as I could not bear the  thought that my dear wife and children would be in want of every means  of support. We lived in this manner, 'till our carrots were all gone:  then my Wife began to lament because of our poor babies: but I comforted  her all I could; still hoping, and believing that _my_ GOD would not  let us die: but that it would please Him to relieve us, which _He_ did  by almost a Miracle.    We went to bed, as usual, before it was quite dark, (as we had neither  fire nor candle) but had not been there long before some person knocked  at the door & enquir'd if _James Albert_ lived there? I answer'd in the  affirmative, and rose immediately; as soon as I open'd the door I found  it was the servant of an eminent Attorney who resided at  _Colchester_.--He ask'd me how it was with me? if I was not almost  starv'd? I burst out a crying, and told him I was indeed. He said his  master suppos'd so, and that he wanted to speak with me, and I must  return with him. This Gentleman's name was _Danniel_, he was a sincere,  good Christian. He used to stand and talk with me frequently when I  work'd in the road for Mr. _Handbarrar_, and would have employed me  himself, if I had wanted work.--When I came to his house he told me that  he had thought a good deal about me of late, and was apprehensive that I  must be in want, and could not be satisfied till he sent to enquire  after me. I made known my distress to him, at which he was greatly  affected; and generously gave me a guinea; and promis'd to be kind to me  in future. I could not help exclaiming. _O the boundless mercies of my  God!_ I pray'd unto Him, and He has heard me; I trusted in Him and He  has preserv'd me: where shall I begin to praise Him, or how shall I love  Him enough?    I went immediately and bought some bread and cheese and coal and carried  it home. My dear wife was rejoiced to see me return with something to  eat. She instantly got up and dressed our Babies, while I made a fire,  and the first Nobility in the land never made a more comfortable  meal.--We did not forget to thank the LORD for all his goodness to  us.--Soon after this, as the spring came on, Mr. Peter _Daniel_ employed  me in helping to pull down a house, and rebuilding it. I had then very  good work, and full employ: he sent for my wife, and children to  _Colchester_, and provided us a house where we lived very  comfortably.--I hope I shall always gratefully acknowledge his kindness  to myself and family. I worked at this house for more than a year, till  it was finished; and after that I was employed by several successively,  and was never so happy as when I had something to do; but perceiving  the winter coming on, and work rather slack, I was apprehensive that we  should again be in want or become troublesome to our friends.    I had at this time an offer made me of going to _Norwich_ and having  constant employ.--My wife seemed pleased with this proposal, as she  supposed she might get work there in the weaving-manufactory, being the  business she was brought up to, and more likely to succeed there than  any other place; and we thought as we had an opportunity of moving to a  Town where we could both be employ'd it was most adviseable to do so;  and that probably we might settle there for our lives.--When this step  was resolv'd on, I went first alone to see how it would answer; which I  very much repented after, for it was not in my power immediately to send  my wife any supply, as I fell into the hands of a Master that was  neither kind nor considerate; and she was reduced to great distress, so  that she was oblig'd to sell the few goods that we had, and when I sent  for her was under the disagreeable necessity of parting with our bed.    When she came to _Norwich_ I hired a room ready furnished.--I  experienced a great deal of difference in the carriage of my Master from  what I had been accustomed to from some of my other Masters. He was very  irregular in his payments to me.--My wife hired a loom and wove all the  leisure time she had and we began to do very well, till we were  overtaken by fresh misfortunes. Our three poor children fell ill of the  small pox; this was a great trial to us; but still I was persuaded in  myself we should not be forsaken.--And I did all in my power to keep my  dear partner's spirits from sinking. Her whole attention now was taken  up with the children as she could mind nothing else, and all I could get  was but little to support a family in such a situation, beside paying  for the hire of our room, which I was obliged to omit doing for several  weeks: but the woman to whom we were indebted would not excuse us, tho'  I promised she should have the very first money we could get after my  children came about, but she would not be satisfied and had the cruelty  to threaten us that if we did not pay her immediately she would turn us  all into the street.    The apprehension of this plunged me in the deepest distress,  considering the situation of my poor babies: if they had been in health  I should have been less sensible of this misfortune. But My GOD, _still  faithful to his promise_, raised me a friend. Mr. Henry Gurdney, a  Quaker, a gracious gentleman heard of our distress, he sent a servant of  his own to the woman we hired the room of, paid our rent, and bought all  the goods with my wife's loom and gave it us all.    Some other gentlemen, hearing of his design, were pleased to assist him  in these generous acts, for which we never can be thankful enough; after  this my children soon came about; we began to do pretty well again; my  dear wife work'd hard and constant when she could get work, but it was  upon a disagreeable footing as her employ was so uncertain, sometimes  she could get nothing to do and at other times when the weavers of  _Norwich_ had orders from London they were so excessively hurried, that  the people they employ'd were often oblig'd to work on the  _Sabbath-day_; but this my wife would never do, and it was matter of  uneasiness to us that we could not get our living in a regular manner,  though we were both diligent, industrious, and willing to work. I was  far from being happy in my Master, he did not use me well. I could  scarcely ever get my money from him; but I continued patient 'till it  pleased GOD to alter my situation.    My worthy friend Mr. Gurdney advised me to follow the employ of chopping  chaff, and bought me an instrument for that purpose. There were but few  people in the town that made this their business beside myself; so that  I did very well indeed and we became easy and happy.--But we did not  continue long in this comfortable state: Many of the inferior people  were envious and ill-natur'd and set up the same employ and work'd under  price on purpose to get my"]]]
