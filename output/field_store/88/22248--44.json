In 1635 he was patronized by King Charles I. on account of  his early and promising abilities; he took him into his service, and  appointed him resident at the court of Spain[1]. During his embassy  there, his chief business was, to demand reparation and punishment of  some free-booters, who had taken ships from the English, and to  endeavour the restoration of amity, trade and commerce.    When the civil war broke out, he returned to England, having  accomplished the purposes of his embassy abroad, and attached himself  with the utmost zeal to the Royal Standard; and during those  calamitous times was intrusted with many important matters of state.    In 1644, attending the court at Oxford, the degree of Doctor of Civil  Laws was conferred upon him[2], and the reputation of his parts every  day increasing, he was thought a proper person to be secretary to  Charles, Prince of Wales, whom he attended into the Western parts of  England, and from thence into the Isles of Scilly and Jersey.    In 1648 he was appointed treasurer of the navy, under the command of  Prince Rupert, in which office he continued till the year 1650, when  he was created a baronet by King Charles II. and sent envoy  extraordinary to the court of Spain. Being recalled thence into  Scotland, where the King then was, he served there in quality of  secretary of state, to the satisfaction of all parties,  notwithstanding he refused to take the covenant engagements, which  Charles II. forced by the importunity of the Presbyterians, entered  into, with a resolution to break them. In 1651 he was made prisoner at  the battle of Worcester and committed to close custody in London,  where he continued, 'till his confinement introduced a very dangerous  sickness; he then had liberty granted him, upon giving bail, to go for  the recovery of his health, into any place he should chuse, provided  he stirred not five miles from thence, without leave from the  Parliament.    In February, 1659, he repaired to the King at Breda, who knighted him  the April following. Upon his Majesty's reiteration, it was expected,  from his great services, and the regard the King had for him, that he  would have been made secretary of state, but at that period there were  so many people's merits to repay, and so great a clamour for  preferment, that Sir Richard was disappointed, but had the place of  master of requests conferred on him, a station, in those times, of  considerable profit and dignity.    On account of his being a good Latin scholar, he was also made a  secretary for that tongue[3]. In 1661, being one of the burgesses for  the university of Cambridge, he was sworn a privy counsellor for  Ireland, and having by his residence in foreign parts, qualified  himself for public employment, he was sent envoy extraordinary to  Portugal, with a dormant commission to the ambassador, which he was to  make use of as occasion should require. Shortly after, he was  appointed ambassador to that court, where he negotiated the marriage  between his master King Charles II. and the Infanta Donna Catharina,  daughter to King John VI. and towards the end of the same year he  returned to England. We are assured by Wood, that in the year 1662, he  was sent again ambassador to that court, and when he had finished his  commission, to the mutual satisfaction of Charles II. and Alphonso  King of Portugal, being recalled in 1663, he was sworn one of his  Majesty's Privy Council. In the beginning of the year 1644 he was sent  ambassador to Philip IV. King of Spain, and arrived February 29 at  Cadiz, where he met with a very extraordinary and unexpected  salutation, and was received with some circumstances of particular  esteem. It appears from one of Sir Richard's letters, that this  distinguishing respect was paid him, not only on his own, but on his  master's account; and in another of his letters he discovers the  secret why the Spaniard yielded him, contrary to his imperious proud  nature, so much honour, and that is, that he expected Tangier and  Jamaica to be restored to him by England, which occasioned his arrival  to be so impatiently longed for, and magnificently celebrated. During  his residence at this court King Philip died, September 17, 1665,  leaving his son Charles an infant, and his dominions under the regency  of his queen, Mary Anne, daughter of the emperor Ferdinand III. Sir  Richard taking the advantage of his minority, put the finishing hand  to a peace with Spain, which was sufficiently tired and weakened with  a 25 years war, for the recovery of Portugal, which had been  dismembered from the Spanish crown in 1640; the treaty of peace was  signed at Madrid December 6, 1665. About the 14th of January  following, his excellency took a journey into Portugal, where he staid  till towards the end of March; the design of his journey certainly was  to effect an accommodation between that crown and Spain, which however  was not produced till 1667, by the interposition of his Britannic  Majesty. Our author having finished his commission was preparing for  his return to England, when June 4, 1666, he was seized at Madrid with  a violent fever, which put an end to his valuable life, the 16th of  the same month, the very day he intended to set out for England: his  body being embalmed, it was conveyed by his lady, and all his  children, then living, by land to Calais, and so to London, whence  being carried to All Saints church in Hertford, it was deposited in  the vault of his father-in-law, Sir John Harrison. The Author of the  Short Account of his Life, prefixed to his letters, says, 'that he was  remarkable for his meekness, sincerity, humanity and piety, and also  was an able statesman and a great scholar, being in particular a  compleat master of several modern languages, especially the Spanish,  which he spoke and wrote with as much advantage, as if he had been a  native.' By his lady, eldest daughter of Sir John Harrison, he had six  sons, and eight daughters, whereof only one son and four daughters  survived him.    The following is an account of his works,    1. An English Translation in Rhyme, of the celebrated Italian  Pastoral, called Il Pastor Fido, or the Faithful Shepherd, written  originally by Battista Guarini, printed in London, 1644 in 4to. and  1664 8vo.    2. A Translation from English into Latin Verse, of the Faithful  Shepherders, a Pastoral, written originally by John Fletcher, Gent.  London, 1658.    3. In the octavo edition of the Faithful Shepherd, Anno 1664, are  inserted the following Poems of our author, viz. 1st, An Ode upon the  Occasion of his Majesty's Proclamation, 1630, commanding the Gentry to  reside upon their Estates in the Country. 2d, A Summary Discourse of  the Civil Wars of Rome, extracted from the best Latin Writers in Prose  and Verse. 3d, An English Translation of the Fourth Book of Virgil's  AEneid on the Loves of Dido and AEneas. 4th, Two Odes out of Horace,  relating to the Civil Wars of Rome, against covetous, rich Men.    4. He translated out of Portuguese into English, The Lusiad, or  Portugal's Historical Poem, written originally by Luis de Camoens,  London, 1655, &c. folio.    After his decease, namely, in 1671, were published these two  posthumous pieces of his in 4to, Querer per solo Querer, To Love only  for Love's sake, a Dramatic Romance, represented before the King and  Queen of Spain, and Fiestas de Aranjuez, Festivals at Aranjuez: both  written originally in Spanish, by Antonio de Mendoza, upon occasion of  celebrating the Birth-day of King Philip IV. in 1623, at Aranjuez;  they were translated by our author in 1654, during his confinement at  Taukerley-park in Yorkshire, which uneasy situation induced him to  write the following stanzas on this work, which are here inserted, as  a specimen of his versification.      Time was, when I, a pilgrim of the seas,    When I 'midst noise of camps, and courts disease,    Purloin'd some hours to charm rude cares with verse,    Which flame of faithful shepherd did rehearse.      But now restrain'd from sea, from camp, from court,    And by a tempest blown into a port;    I raise my thoughts to muse on higher things,    And eccho arms, and loves of Queens and Kings.      Which Queens (despising crowns and Hymen's band)    Would neither men obey, nor men command:    Great pleasure from rough seas to see the shore    Or from firm land to hear the billows roar.    We are told that he composed several other things remaining still in  manuscript, which he had not leisure to compleat; even some of the  printed pieces have not all the finishing so ingenious an author could  have bestowed upon them; for as the writer of his Life observes,  'being, for his loyalty and zeal to his Majesty's service, tossed from  place to place, and from country to country, during the unsettled  times of our anarchy, some of his Manuscripts falling into unskilful  hands, were printed and published without his knowledge, and before he  could give them the last finishing strokes.' But that was not the case  with his Translation of the Pastor Fido, which was published by  himself, and applauded by some of the best judges, particularly Sir  John Denham, who after censuring servile translators, thus goes on,      A new and nobler way thou dost pursue    To make translations and translators too.    They but preserve the ashes, these the flame,    True to his sense, but truer to his fame.    Footnotes:  1. Short Account of Sir Richard Fanshaw, prefixed to his Letters.  2.

What was the consequence? The  interest up to July last had been paid; in January of this year  L2,250 was due for interest, and there was not a penny to meet it.        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    To take up arms and fight was nonsense; to draw the sword would be to  draw the sword against God, for it was God's judgment that the State  was in the condition it was to-day; and it was their duty to inquire  whether they should immerse in blood the thousands of innocent  inhabitants of this country, and if so, what for? For an idea--for  something they had in their heads, but not in their hearts; for an  independence which was not prized. Let them make the best of the  situation, and get the best terms they possibly could; let them agree  to join their hands to those of their brethren in the south, and then  from the Cape to the Zambesi there would be one great people. Yes,  there was something grand in that--grander even than their idea of a  Republic--something which ministered to their national feeling. And  would this be so miserable? Yes; this would be miserable for those  who would not be under the law, for the rebel and revolutionist, but  welfare and prosperity for the men of law and order.        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    They must not underrate their real and many difficulties. He could  point to the south-western border, the Zulu, the goldfields, and  other questions, and show them that it was their duty to come to an  arrangement with the British Government, and to do so in a bold and  manly manner. An hon. member on Saturday last had spoken with a  fervent patriotism; but he had failed to appreciate the reference,  because it amounted to this--that they must shut their eyes to  everything, so as to keep their independence.    President Burgers, who left the Transvaal broken-hearted, more by the  cruel and mean intriguing and dissensions among, and disloyalty of,  his own people, which made the annexation possible, than by the Act  itself, when dying left a statement of the case. It is too long to  reproduce in its entirety. He shows how the English faction worked  for annexation, and how the Dopper party, headed by Kruger, allied  themselves with the former in intrigue against the Government,  thwarting all effort at reform and organization, and encouraging the  refusal to pay taxes. He states plainly that this course was pursued  by Kruger in order to oust him from power, and secure the Presidency  for himself. He shows how he opposed 'that other element which had  formerly worked in secret, viz., British interference, which got a  strong support from the Boers themselves, and one of their chief  leaders, P. Kruger, who had betrayed me, after promising me his and  his party's support.' He gives the final scene as follows:    The Volksraad had gone away, having done nothing but harm. The  members of the Executive had gone home, as if all were safe, and I  sat with a half-new Cabinet and part of an old one, half discharged.  Yet I made one attempt more, and drafted a letter to Shepstone,  intimating that I would oppose the annexation by force of arms, etc.;  and showed this to two members of the Executive. The response to my  appeal, however, was so weak (one of them being in league with the  English) that I had to abandon the project, and try to prepare for  the worst. When, therefore, Shepstone's announcement came--that he  could wait no longer, that he had given us time enough to reform, and  that he must issue his proclamation--I could do no more than advise a  protest, and an appeal to foreign powers. This having been agreed to  by my Government, I met Shepstone in presence of the Executive, and  what could be saved for the country, such as its language, its  legislature, the position of its officials, etc., was arranged.  Before issuing his proclamation, Shepstone desired to see copies of  both mine and the Government protest. This I promised, on condition  he showed me his proclamation before publication: to which he agreed.  To one clause I greatly objected, and protested--namely, the threat  of confiscation of property for disobeying the proclamation. I  pointed out that this was barbarous, and would be punishing a man's  innocent family for his actions. The clause was omitted. This is  the origin of the lie that I helped Shepstone in drawing up this  proclamation. In justice to Shepstone, I must say that I would not  consider an officer of my Government to have acted faithfully if he  had not done what Shepstone did; and if the act was wrong (which  undoubtedly it was), not he, but his Government, is to blame for it.    Messrs. Kruger and Jorissen left within a month to protest in England  against the annexation.    Sir T. Shepstone wrote (May 9): 'Mr. Paul Kruger and his colleague,  Dr. Jorissen, D.D., the Commission to Europe, leave to-day. I do not  think that either of them wishes the Act of Annexation to be  cancelled; Dr. Jorissen certainly does not.' And Mr. J.D. Barry,  Recorder of Kimberley, wrote to Frere (May 15): 'The delegates, Paul  Kruger and Dr. Jorissen, left Pretoria on the 8th, and even they do  not seem to have much faith in their mission. Dr. Jorissen thinks  that the reversal of Sir Theophilus's Act would not only be  impossible, but a great injury to the country.'    It is not necessary to seek hostile testimony to establish the fact  that the Boers as a whole acquiesced in the annexation; the  foregoing quotation from Aylward's book supplies all that is  needed--unintentionally, perhaps. The Zulu menace, which Aylward so  lightly dismisses, was a very serious matter; the danger a very real  one. It has frequently been asserted by the Boers and their friends  that the Zulu trouble was fomented by a section of the Natal people,  and that Sir Theophilus Shepstone himself, if he did not openly  encourage the Zulu King in his threats and encroachments on the  Transvaal, at any rate refrained from using his unique influence and  power with the Zulus in the direction of peace, and that he made a  none too scrupulous use of the Zulu question when he forced the  annexation of the Transvaal. It is stated that, in the first place,  there was no real danger, and in the next place, if there were, such  was Sir Theophilus's power with the Zulus that he could have averted  it; and in support of the first point, and in demolition of Sir T.  Shepstone's pro-annexation arguments, the following extract from the  latter's despatches is quoted by Aylward and others:    EXTRACT FROM DESPATCH, DATED UTRECHT, TRANSVAAL, JANUARY 29, 1878.    _Sir T. Shepstone to Sir H. Bulwer_.    Par. 12. 'Although this question has existed for many years, and the  settlement of it has been long postponed, yet on no former occasion  has it assumed so serious an aspect, or included so wide an area of  territory; never before has there existed any bar to the farmers  occupying their farms after an absence more or less temporary, caused  by a temporary and local scare. Practically, the line of occupied  farms has not been heretofore affected by the dispute about the  beaconed boundary, but now the prohibition to these has become  absolute by Zulu claims and action. Ruin is staring the farmers in  the face, and their position is, _for the time, worse under Her  Majesty's Government than ever it was under the Republic_.'    Had Sir T. Shepstone's power been as great as represented, it is fair  to suppose that it would have been exerted, and would have prevailed  in support of his own administration; but it seems clear that he  could do nothing; and as to the reality of the danger, nothing could  better establish that than the unpleasant admissions in the foregoing  extract and the initial disasters in the Zulu War a year later. The  Boers' protective power was not lessened by the annexation--quite  otherwise. It was supplemented by British money, arms, and soldiers,  and the prestige of the British flag, and yet things happened as  above described. What would they have been under the old conditions?    The day before he issued the proclamation Sir T. Shepstone sent a  messenger to Cetewayo, telling him that the Transvaal would be under  British sovereignty, and warning him against aggression in that  direction. Cetewayo replied: 'I thank my father Somtseu (Shepstone)  for his message. I am glad that he has sent it, because the Dutch  have tired me out, and I intended to fight with them once, only once,  and to drive them over the Vaal. Kabana, you see my impis are  gathered. It was to fight the Dutch I called them together. Now I  will send them back to their houses.' (C. 1883, p. 19.)    Colonel A.W. Durnford; R.E., in a memorandum of July 5, 1877, wrote:    About this time (April 10) Cetewayo had massed his forces in three  corps on the borders, and would undoubtedly have swept the Transvaal,  country not been taken over by the English. In my opinion, he would  have cleared the country to Pretoria.    'I am convinced,' wrote Sir A. Cunynghame, June 12, from Pretoria,  'that had this country not been annexed, it would have been ravaged  by the native tribes. Forty square miles of country had been overrun  by natives, and every house burned, just before the annexation.' And  he wrote again, July 6: 'Every day convinces me that unless this  country had been annexed it would have been a prey to plunder and  rapine from the natives on its border, joined by Secocoeni, Mapok,  and other tribes in the Transvaal. Feeling the influence of the  British Government, they are now tranquil.'    So much for the reality of the danger. As to the"]]]
