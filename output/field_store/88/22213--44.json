On the  instant her lips trembled and parted.    \"Oh, Daren--don't you know me?\" she asked.    \"Mel Iden!\" he burst out. \"Know you? I should smile I do. But it--it  was so sudden. And you're older--different somehow. Mel, you're  sweeter--why you're beautiful.\"    He clasped her hands and held on to them, until he felt her rather  nervously trying to withdraw them.    \"Oh, Daren, I'm glad to see you home--alive--whole,\" she said, almost  in a whisper. \"Are you--well?\"    \"No, Mel. I'm in pretty bad shape,\" he replied. \"Lucky to get home  alive--to see you all.\"    \"I'm sorry. You're so white. You're wonderfully changed, Daren.\"    \"So are you. But I'll say I'm happy it's not painted face and plucked  eyebrows.... Mel, what's happened to you?\"    She suddenly espied the decoration on his coat. The blood rose and  stained her clear cheek. With a gesture of exquisite grace and  sensibility that thrilled Lane she touched the medal. \"Oh! The _Croix  de Guerre_.... Daren, you were a hero.\"    \"No, Mel, just a soldier.\"    She looked up into his face with eyes that fascinated Lane, so  beautiful were they--the blue of corn-flowers--and lighted then with  strange rapt glow.    \"Just a soldier!\" she murmured. But Lane heard in that all the  sweetness and understanding possible for any woman's heart. She amazed  him--held him spellbound. Here was the sympathy--and something  else--a nameless need--for which he yearned. The moment was fraught  with incomprehensible forces. Lane's sore heart responded to her rapt  look, to the sudden strange passion of her pale face. Swiftly he  divined that Mel Iden gloried in the presence of a maimed and proven  soldier.    \"Mel, I'll come to see you,\" he said, breaking the spell. \"Do you  still live out on the Hill road? I remember the four big white oaks.\"    \"No, Daren, I've left home,\" she said, with slow change, as if his  words recalled something she had forgotten. All the radiance vanished,  leaving her singularly white.    \"Left home! What for?\" he asked, bluntly.    \"Father turned me out,\" she replied, with face averted. The soft  roundness of her throat swelled. Lane saw her full breast heave under  her coat.    \"What're you saying, Mel Iden?\" he demanded, as quickly as he could  find his voice.    Then she turned bravely to meet his gaze, and Lane had never seen as  sad eyes as looked into his.    \"Daren, haven't you heard--about me?\" she asked, with tremulous lips.    \"No. What's wrong?\"    \"I--I can't let you call on me.\"    \"Why not? Are you married--jealous husband?\"    \"No, I'm not married--but I--I have a baby,\" she whispered.    \"Mel!\" gasped Lane. \"A war baby?\"    \"Yes.\"    Lane was so shocked he could not collect his scattered wits, let alone  think of the right thing to say, if there were any right thing. \"Mel,  this is a--a terrible surprise. Oh, I'm sorry.... How the war played  hell with all of us! But for you--Mel Iden--I can't believe it.\"    \"Daren, so terribly true,\" she said. \"Don't I look it?\"    \"Mel, you look--oh--heartbroken.\"    \"Yes, I am broken-hearted,\" she replied, and drooped her head.    \"Forgive me, Mel. I hardly know what I'm saying.... But listen--I'm  coming to see you.\"    \"No,\" she said.    That trenchant word was thought-provoking. A glimmer of understanding  began to dawn in Lane. Already an immense pity had flooded his soul,  and a profound sense of the mystery and tragedy of Mel Iden. She had  always been unusual, aloof, proud, unattainable, a girl with a heart  of golden fire. And now she had a nameless child and was an outcast  from her father's house. The fact, the fatality of it, stunned Lane.    \"Daren, I must go in to see Dr. Bronson,\" she said. \"I'm glad you're  home. I'm proud of you. I'm happy for your mother and Lorna. You must  watch Lorna--try to restrain her. She's going wrong. All the young  girls are going wrong. Oh, it's a more dreadful time _now_ than before  or during the war. The let-down has been terrible.... Good-bye,  Daren.\"    In other days Manton's building on Main Street had appeared a  pretentious one to Lane's untraveled eyes. It was an old three-story  red-brick-front edifice, squatted between higher and more modern  structures. When he climbed the dirty dark stairway up to the second  floor a throng of memories returned with the sensations of creaky  steps, musty smell, and dim light. When he pushed open a door on which  MANTON & CO. showed in black letters he caught his breath. Long--long  past! Was it possible that he had been penned up for three years in  this stifling place?    Manton carried on various lines of business, and for Middleville, he  was held to be something of a merchant and broker. Lane was wholly  familiar with the halls, the several lettered doors, the large  unpartitioned office at the back of the building. Here his slow  progress was intercepted by a slip of a girl who asked him what he  wanted. Before answering, Lane took stock of the girl. She might have  been all of fifteen--no older. She had curly bobbed hair, and a face  that would have been comely but for the powder and rouge. She was  chewing gum, and she ogled Lane.    \"I want to see Mr. Manton,\" Lane said.    \"What name, please.\"    \"Daren Lane.\"    She tripped off toward the door leading to Manton's private offices,  and Lane's gaze, curiously following her, found her costume to be  startling even to his expectant eyes. Then she disappeared. Lane's  gaze sought the corner and desk that once upon a time had been his. A  blond young lady, also with bobbed hair, was operating a typewriter at  his desk. She glanced up, and espying Lane, she suddenly stopped her  work. She recognized him. But, if she were Hattie Wilson, it was  certain that Lane did not recognize her. Then the office girl  returned.    \"Step this way, please. Mr. Smith will see you.\"    How singularly it struck Lane that not once in three years had he  thought of Smith. But when he saw him, the intervening months were as  nothing. Lean, spare, pallid, with baggy eyes, and the nose of a  drinker, Smith had not changed.    \"How do, Lane. So you're back? Welcome to our city,\" he said,  extending a nerveless hand that felt to Lane like a dead fish.    \"Hello, Mr. Smith. Yes, I'm back,\" returned Lane, taking the chair  Smith indicated. And then he met the inevitable questions as best he  could in order not to appear curt or uncivil.    \"I'd like to see Mr. Manton to ask for my old job,\" interposed Lane,  presently.    \"He's busy now, Lane, but maybe he'll see you. I'll find out.\"    Smith got up and went out. Lane sat there with a vague sense of  absurdity in the situation. The click of a typewriter sounded from  behind him. He wanted to hurry out. He wanted to think of other  things, and twice he drove away memory of the girl he had just left at  Doctor Bronson's office. Presently Smith returned, slipping along in  his shiny black suit, flat-footed and slightly bowed, with his set  dull expression.    \"Lane, Mr. Manton asks you to please excuse him. He's extremely busy,\"  said Smith. \"I told him that you wanted your old job back. And he  instructed me to tell you he had been put to the trouble of breaking  in a girl to take your place. She now does the work you used to  have--very satisfactorily, Mr. Manton thinks, and at less pay. So, of  course, a change is impossible.\"    \"I see,\" returned Lane, slowly, as he rose to go. \"I had an idea that  might be the case. I'm finding things--a little different.\"    \"No doubt, Lane. You fellows who went away left us to make the best of  it.\"    \"Yes, Smith, we fellows 'went away,'\" replied Lane, with satire, \"and  I'm finding out the fact wasn't greatly appreciated. Good day.\"    On the way out the little office girl opened the door for him and  ogled him again, and stood a moment on the threshold. Ponderingly,  Lane made his way down to the street. A rush of cool spring air seemed  to refresh him, and with it came a realization that he never would  have been able to stay cooped up in Manton's place. Even if his  services had been greatly desired he could not have given them for  long. He could not have stood that place. This was a new phase of his  mental condition. Work almost anywhere in Middleville would be like  that in Manton's. Could he stand work at all, not only in a physical  sense, but in application of mind? He began to worry about that.    Some one hailed Lane, and he turned to recognize an old  acquaintance--Matt Jones. They walked along the street together,  meeting other men who knew Lane, some of whom greeted him heartily.  Then, during an ensuing hour, he went into familiar stores and the  post-office, the hotel and finally the Bradford Inn, meeting many  people whom he had known well. The sum of all their greetings left him  in cold amaze. At length Lane grasped the subtle import--that people  were tired of any one or anything which reminded them of the war. He  tried to drive that thought from lodgment in his mind. But it stuck.  And slowly he gathered the forces of his spirit to make good the  resolve with which he had faced this day--to withstand an appalling  truth.    At the inn he sat before an open fire and pondered between brief  conversations of men who accosted him. On the one hand it was  extremely trying, and on the other a fascinating and grim study--to  meet people, and find that he could read their minds. Had the war  given him some magic sixth sense, some clairvoyant power, some gift of  vision? He could not tell yet what had come to him, but there was  something.    Business men, halting to chat with Lane a few moments, helped along  his readjustment to the truth of the strange present. Almost all kinds  of business were booming. Most people had money to spend. And there  was a multitude, made rich by the war, who were throwing money to the  four winds. Prices of every commodity were at their highest peak, and  supply could not equal demand. An orgy of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#7)"],[1,"odities, and take of their principal  manufactures, namely striped cotton cloth which they carry with them to  Brazil. Here is also another ship comes hither from Portugal for sugar,  their other manufacture, and returns with it directly thither: for it is  reported that there are several small sugar-works on this island from  which they send home near 100 ton every year; and they have plenty of  cotton growing up in the country wherewith they clothe themselves, and  send also a great deal to Brazil. They have vines of which they make some  wine; but the European ships furnish them with better; though they drink  but little of any. Their chief fruits are (besides plantains in  abundance) oranges, lemons, citrons, melons (both musk and watermelons)  limes, guavas, pomegranates, quinces, custard-apples, and papaws, etc.    OF THE CUSTARD-APPLE, ST. JAGO ROAD.    The custard-apple (as we call it) is a fruit as big as a pomegranate, and  much of the same colour. The outside husk, shell, or rind, is for  substance and thickness between the shell of a pomegranate, and the peel  of a seville orange; softer than this, yet more brittle than that. The  coat or covering is also remarkable in that it is beset round with small  regular knobs or risings; and the inside of the fruit is full of a white  soft pulp, sweet and very pleasant, and most resembling a custard of any  thing, both in colour and taste; from whence probably it is called a  custard-apple by our English. It has in the middle a few small black  stones or kernels; but no core, for it is all pulp. The tree that bears  this fruit is about the bigness of a quince-tree, with long, small, and  thick-set branches spread much abroad: at the extremity of here and there  one of which the fruit grows upon a stalk of its own about 9 or 10 inches  long, slender and tough, and hanging down with its own weight. A large  tree of this sort does not bear usually above 20 or 30 apples, seldom  more. This fruit grows in most countries within the tropics, I have seen  of them (though I omitted the description of them before) all over the  West Indies, both continent and islands; as also in Brazil, and in the  East Indies.    The papaw too is found in all these countries, though I have not hitherto  described it. It is a fruit about the bigness of a musk-melon, hollow as  that is, and much resembling it in shape and colour, both outside and  inside: only in the middle, instead of flat kernels, which the melons  have, these have a handful of small blackish seeds about the bigness of  peppercorns; whose taste is also hot on the tongue somewhat like pepper.  The fruit itself is sweet, soft and luscious, when ripe; but while green  it is hard and unsavoury: though even then being boiled and eaten with  salt-pork or beef, it serves instead of turnips and is as much esteemed.  The papaw-tree is about 10 or 12 foot high. The body near the ground may  be a foot and a half or 2 foot diameter; and it grows up tapering to the  top. It has no branches at all, but only large leaves growing immediately  upon stalks from the body. The leaves are of a roundish form and jagged  about the edges, having their stalks or stumps longer or shorter as they  grow near to or further from the top. They begin to spring from out of  the body of the tree at about 6 or 7 foot height from the ground, the  trunk being bare below: but above that the leaves grow thicker and larger  still towards its top, where they are close and broad. The fruit grows  only among the leaves; and thickest among the thickest of them; insomuch  that towards the top of the tree the papaws spring forth from its body as  thick as they can stick one by another. But then lower down where the  leaves are thinner the fruit is larger, and of the size I have described:  and at the top where they are thick they are but small, and no bigger  than ordinary turnips; yet tasted like the rest.    Their chief land animals are their bullocks, which are said to be many;  though they ask us 20 dollars apiece for them; they have also horses,  asses, and mules, deer, goats, hogs, and black-faced long-tailed monkeys.  Of fowls they have cocks and hens, ducks, guinea-hens, both tame and  wild, parakeets, parrots, pigeons, turtledoves, herons, hawks,  crab-catchers, galdens (a larger sort of crab-catchers) curlews, etc.  Their fish is the same as at Mayo and the rest of these islands, and for  the most part these islands have the same beasts and birds also; but some  of the isles have pasturage and employment for some particular beasts  more than other; and the birds are encouraged, by woods for shelter, and  maize and fruits for food, to flock to some of the islands (as to this of  St. Jago) than to others.    FOGO.    St. Jago Road is one of the worst that I have been in. There is not clean  ground enough for above three ships; and those also must lie very near  each other. One even of these must lie close to the shore, with a  land-fast there: and that is the best for a small ship. I should not have  come in here if I had not been told that it was a good secure place; but  I found it so much otherways that I was in pain to be gone. Captain  Barefoot, who came to an anchor while I was here, in foul ground, lost  quickly 2 anchors; and I had lost a small one. The island Fogo shows  itself from this road very plain, at about 7 or 8 leagues distance; and  in the night we saw the flames of fire issuing from its top.      CHAPTER 2.    SOUTH OF THE LINE TO BRAZIL.    THE AUTHOR'S DELIBERATION ON THE SEQUEL OF HIS VOYAGE AND DEPARTURE FROM  ST. JAGO.    Having despatched my small affairs at the Cape Verde Islands I meditated  on the process of my voyage. I thought it requisite to touch once more at  a cultivated place in these seas, where my men might be refreshed, and  might have a market wherein to furnish themselves with necessaries: for,  designing that my next stretch should be quite to New Holland, and  knowing that after so long a run nothing was to be expected there but  fresh water, if I could meet even with that there, I resolved upon  putting in first at some port of Brazil, and to provide myself there with  whatever I might have further occasion for. Beside the refreshing and  furnishing my men I aimed also at the inuring them gradually and by  intervals to the fatigues that were to be expected in the remainder of  the voyage, which was to be in a part of the world they were altogether  strangers to: none of them, except two young men, having ever crossed the  Line.    HIS COURSE, AND THE WINDS, ETC. IN CROSSING THE LINE.    With this design I sailed from St. Jago on the 22nd of February with the  winds at east-north-east and north-east fair weather and a brisk gale. We  steered away south-south-east and south-south-east half east till in the  latitude of 7 degrees 50 minutes we met with many ripplings in the sea  like a tide or strong current, which setting against the wind caused such  a rippling. We continued to meet these currents from that latitude till  we came into the latitude of 3 degrees 22 north when they ceased. During  this time we saw some bonetas and sharks; catching one of these. We had  the true general tradewind blowing fresh at north-east till in the  latitude of 4 degrees 40 minutes north when the wind varied, and we had  small gales with some tornados. We were then to the east of St. Jago 4  degrees 54 minutes when we got into latitude 3 degrees 2 minutes north  (where I said the rippling ceased) and longitude to the east of St. Jago  5 degrees 2 minutes we had the wind whiffling between the south by east  and east by north small gales, frequent calms, very black clouds with  much rain. In the latitude of 3 degrees 8 minutes north and longitude  east from St. Jago 5 degrees 8 minutes we had the wind from the  south-south-east to the north-north-east faint, and often interrupted  with calms. While we had calms we had the opportunity of trying the  current we had met with hitherto and found that it set north-east by east  half a knot, which is 12 mile in 24 hours: so that here it ran at the  rate of half a mile an hour, and had been much stronger before. The rains  held us by intervals till the latitude of 1 degree 0 minutes north with  small gales of wind between south-south-east and south-east by east and  sometimes calm: afterwards we had the wind between the south and  south-south-east till we crossed the Line, small winds, calms, and pretty  fair weather. We saw but few fish beside porpoises; but of them a great  many and struck one of them.    It was the 10th of March, about the time of the equinox, when we crossed  the equator, having had all along from the latitude of 4 degrees 40  minutes north, where the true tradewind left us, a great swell out of the  south-east and but small uncertain gales, mostly southerly, so that we  crept to the southward but slowly. I kept up against these as well as I  could to the southward, and when we had now and then a flurry of wind at  east I still went away due south, purposely to get to the southward as  fast as I could; for while near the Line I expected to have but uncertain  winds, frequent calms, rains, tornados, etc. which would not only retard  my course but endanger sickness also among my men: especially those who  were ill provided with clothes, or were too lazy to shift themselves when  they were drenched with the rains. The heat of the weather made them  careless of doing this; but taking a dram of brandy which I gave them  when wet, with a charge to shift themselves, they would however lie down  in their hammocks with their wet clothes; so that when they turned out  they caused an ill smell wherever they came, and their hammocks would  stink sufficiently that I think the remedying of this is worth the care  of commanders that cross the Line; especially when they are, it may be, a  month or more before they get out of the rains, at some times of year, as  in June, July or"]]]
