He cannot be  confused either with Monet, or with Pissarro and Renoir. His  comprehension of light is a special one, his technique is not in  accordance with the system of colour-spots; it observes the theory of  complementary colours and of the division of tones without departing  from a grand style, from a classic stateliness, from a superb sureness.  Manet has not been the inventor of Impressionism which co-existed with  his work since 1865, but he has rendered it immense services, by taking  upon himself all the outbursts of anger addressed to the innovators, by  making a breach in public opinion, through which his friends have passed  in behind him. Probably without him all these artists would have  remained unknown, or at least without influence, because they all were  bold characters in art, but timid or disdainful in life. Degas, Monet  and Renoir were fine natures with a horror of polemics, who wished to  hold aloof from the Salons, and were resigned from the outset to be  misunderstood. They were, so to say, electrified by the magnificent  example of Manet's fighting spirit, and Manet was generous enough to  take upon himself the reproaches levelled, not only against his work,  but against theirs. His twenty years of open war, sustained with an  abnegation worthy of all esteem, must be considered as one of the most  significant phenomena of the history of the artists of all ages.    This work of Manet, so much discussed and produced under such tormenting  conditions, owes its importance beyond all to its power and frankness.  Ten years of developing the first manner, tragically limited by the war  of 1870; thirteen years of developing the second evolution, parallel  with the efforts of the Impressionists. The period from 1860 to 1870 is  logically connected with Hals and Goya; from 1870 to 1883 the artist's  modernity is complicated by the study of light. His personality appears  there even more original, but one may well give the palm to those works  of Manet which are painted in his classic and low-toned manner. He had  all the pictorial gifts which make the glory of the masters: full, true,  broad composition, colouring of irresistible power, blacks and greys  which cannot be found elsewhere since Velasquez and Goya, and a profound  knowledge of values. He has tried his hand at everything: portraits,  landscapes, seascapes, scenes of modern life, still-life and nudes have  each in their turn served his ardent desire of creation. His was a much  finer comprehension of contemporary life than seems to be admitted by  Realism: one has only to compare him with Courbet, to see how far more  nervous and intelligent he was, without loss to the qualities of truth  and robustness. His pictures will always remain documents of the  greatest importance on the society, the manners and customs of the  second Empire. He did not possess the gift of psychology. His _Christ  aux Anges_ and _Jesus insulte_ are obviously only pieces of painting  without idealism. He was, like the great Dutch virtuosos, and like  certain Italians, more eye than soul. Yet his _Maximilian_, the drawings  to Poe's _Raven_, and certain sketches show that he might have realised  some curious, psychological works, had he not been so completely  absorbed by the immediate reality and by the desire for beautiful paint.  A beautiful painter--this is what he was before everything else, this is  his fairest fame, and it is almost inconceivable that the juries of the  Salons failed to understand him. They waxed indignant over his subjects  which offer only a restricted interest, and they did not see the  altogether classic quality of this technique without bitumen, without  glazing, without tricks; of this vibrating colour; of this rich paint;  of this passionate design so suitable for expressing movement and  gestures true to life; of this simple composition where the whole  picture is based upon two or three values with the straightforwardness  one admires in Rubens, Jordaens and Hals.    [Illustration: MANET    DEJEUNER]    Manet will occupy an important position in the French School. He is the  most original painter of the second half of the nineteenth century, the  one who has really created a great movement. His work, the fecundity of  which is astonishing, is unequal. One has to remember that, besides the  incessant strife which he kept up--a strife which would have killed many  artists--he had to find strength for two grave crises in himself. He  joined one movement, then freed himself of it, then invented another and  recommenced to learn painting at a point where anybody else would have  continued in his previous manner. \"Each time I paint,\" he said to  Mallarme, \"I throw myself into the water to learn swimming.\" It is not  surprising that such a man should have been unequal, and that one can  distinguish in his work between experiments, exaggerations due to  research, and efforts made to reject the prejudices of which we feel the  weight no longer. But it would be unjust to say that Manet has only had  the merit of opening up new roads; that has been said to belittle him,  after it had first been said that these roads led into absurdity. Works  like the _Toreador_, _Rouviere_, _Mme. Manet_, the _Dejeuner_, the  _Musique aux Tuileries_, the _Bon Bock_, _Argenteuil_, _Le Linge_, _En  Bateau_ and the _Bar_, will always remain admirable masterpieces which  will do credit to French painting, of which the spontaneous, living,  clear and bold art of Manet is a direct and very representative product.    There remains, then, a great personality who knew how to dominate the  rather coarse conceptions of Realism, who influenced by his modernity  all contemporary illustration, who re-established a sound and strong  tradition in the face of the Academy, and who not only created a new  transition, but marked his place on the new road which he had opened. To  him Impressionism owes its existence; his tenacity enabled it to take  root and to vanquish the opposition of the School; his work has enriched  the world by some beautiful examples which demonstrate the union of the  two principles of Realism and of that technical Impressionism which was  to supply Manet, Renoir, Pissarro and Sisley with an object for their  efforts. For the sum total of all that is evoked by his name, Edouard  Manet certainly deserves the name of a man of genius--an incomplete  genius, though, since the thought with him was not on the level of his  technique, since he could never affect the emotions like a Leonardo or a  Rembrandt, but genius all the same through the magnificent power of his  gifts, the continuity of his style, and the importance of his part which  infused blood into a school dying of the anaemia of conventional art.  Whoever beholds a work of Manet's, even without knowing the conditions  of his life, will feel that there is something great, the lion's claw  which Delacroix had recognised as far back as 1861, and to which, it is  said, even the great Ingres had paid homage on the jury which examined  with disgust the _Guitarero_.    [Illustration: MANET    PORTRAIT OF MADAME M.L.]    To-day Manet is considered almost as a classic glory; and the progress  for which he had given the impulse, has been so rapid, that many are  astonished that he should ever have been considered audacious. Sight is  transformed, strife is extinguished, and a large, select public,  familiar with Monet and Renoir, judge Manet almost as a long defunct  initiator. One has to know his admirable life, one has to know well the  incredible inertia of the Salons where he appeared, to give him his full  due. And when, after the acceptance of Impressionism, the unavoidable  reaction will take place, Manet's qualities of solidity, truth and  science will appear such, that he will survive many of those to whom he  has opened the road and facilitated the success at the expense of his  own. It will be seen that Degas and he have, more than the others, and  with less apparent _eclat_, united the gifts which produce durable works  in the midst of the fluctuations of fashion and the caprices of taste  and views. Manet can, at the Louvre or any other gallery, hold his own  in the most crushing surroundings, prove his personal qualities, and  worthily represent a period which he loved.    An enormous amount has been written on him, from Zola's bold and  intelligent pamphlet in 1865, to the recent work by M. Theodore Duret.  Few men have provoked more comments. In an admirable picture, _Hommage a  Manet_, the delicate and perfect painter Fantin-Latour, a friend from  the first hour, has grouped around the artist some of his admirers,  Monet, Renoir, Duranty, Zola, Bazille, and Braquemond. The picture has  to-day a place of honour at the Luxembourg, where Manet is  insufficiently represented by _Olympia_, a study of a woman, and the  _Balcony_. A collection is much to be desired of his lithographs, his  etchings and his pastels, in which he has proved his diversified  mastery, and also of his portraits of famous contemporaries, Zola,  Rochefort, Desboutin, Proust, Mallarme, Clemenceau, Guys, Faure,  Baudelaire, Moore, and others, an admirable series by a visionary who  possessed, in a period of unrest and artificiality, the quality of rude  sincerity, and the love of truth of a Primitive.    [Illustration: MANET    THE HOTHOUSE]          IV    EDGAR DEGAS: HIS WORK, HIS INFLUENCE      I have said how vain it is to class artistic temperaments under a title  imposed upon them generally by circumstances and dates, rather than by  their own free will. The study of Degas will furnish additional proof  for it. Classed with the Impressionists, this master participates in  their ideas in the sphere of composition, rather than in that of colour.  He belongs to them through his modernity and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14060"],[0,"Mr. Britling Sees It Through (#7)"],[1," \"I think you'll find very soon it's the  old John Bull. Perhaps not Mrs. Humphry Ward's John Bull, or Mrs. Henry  Wood's John Bull but true essentially to Shakespeare, Fielding, Dickens,  Meredith....\"    \"I suppose,\" he added, \"there are changes. There's a new generation  grown up....\"    He looked at his barn and the swimming pool. \"It's a good point of yours  about the barn,\" he said. \"What you say reminds me of that very jolly  thing of Kipling's about the old mill-wheel that began by grinding corn  and ended by driving dynamos....    \"Only I admit that barn doesn't exactly drive a dynamo....    \"To be frank, it's just a pleasure barn....    \"The country can afford it....\"      Section 2    He left it at that for the time, but throughout the afternoon Mr. Direck  had the gratification of seeing his thought floating round and round in  the back-waters of Mr. Britling's mental current. If it didn't itself  get into the stream again its reflection at any rate appeared and  reappeared. He was taken about with great assiduity throughout the  afternoon, and he got no more than occasional glimpses of the rest of  the Dower House circle until six o'clock in the evening.    Meanwhile the fountains of Mr. Britling's active and encyclopaedic mind  played steadily.    He was inordinately proud of England, and he abused her incessantly. He  wanted to state England to Mr. Direck as the amiable summation of a  grotesque assembly of faults. That was the view into which the comforts  and prosperities of his middle age had brought him from a radicalism  that had in its earlier stages been angry and bitter. And for Mr.  Britling England was \"here.\" Essex was the county he knew. He took Mr.  Direck out from his walled garden by a little door into a trim paddock  with two white goals. \"We play hockey here on Sundays,\" he said in a way  that gave Mr. Direck no hint of the practically compulsory participation  of every visitor to Matching's Easy in this violent and dangerous  exercise, and thence they passed by a rich deep lane and into a high  road that ran along the edge of the deer park of Claverings. \"We will  call in on Claverings later,\" said Mr. Britling. \"Lady Homartyn has some  people there for the week-end, and you ought to see the sort of thing it  is and the sort of people they are. She wanted us to lunch there  to-morrow, but I didn't accept that because of our afternoon hockey.\"    Mr. Direck received this reason uncritically.    The village reminded Mr. Direck of Abbey's pictures. There was an inn  with a sign standing out in the road, a painted sign of the Clavering  Arms; it had a water trough (such as Mr. Weller senior ducked the  dissenter in) and a green painted table outside its inviting door. There  were also a general shop and a number of very pleasant cottages, each  marked with the Mainstay crest. All this was grouped about a green with  real geese drilling thereon. Mr. Britling conducted his visitor (through  a lych gate) into the church-yard, and there they found mossy,  tumble-down tombstones, one with a skull and cross-bones upon it, that  went back to the later seventeenth century. In the aisle of the church  were three huge hatchments, and there was a side chapel devoted to the  Mainstay family and the Barons Homartyn, with a series of monuments that  began with painted Tudor effigies and came down to a vast stained glass  window of the vilest commercial Victorian. There were also mediaeval  brasses of parish priests, and a marble crusader and his lady of some  extinguished family which had ruled Matching's Easy before the Mainstays  came. And as the two gentlemen emerged from the church they ran against  the perfect vicar, Mr. Dimple, ample and genial, with an embracing laugh  and an enveloping voice. \"Come to see the old country,\" he said to Mr.  Direck. \"So Good of you Americans to do that! So Good of you....\"    There was some amiable sparring between the worthy man and Mr. Britling  about bringing Mr. Direck to church on Sunday morning. \"He's terribly  Lax,\" said Mr. Dimple to Mr. Direck, smiling radiantly. \"Terribly Lax.  But then nowadays Everybody _is_ so Lax. And he's very Good to my Coal  Club; I don't know what we should do without him. So I just admonish  him. And if he doesn't go to church, well, anyhow he doesn't go anywhere  else. He may be a poor churchman, but anyhow he's not a dissenter....\"    \"In England, you see,\" Mr. Britling remarked, after they had parted from  the reverend gentleman, \"we have domesticated everything. We have even  domesticated God.\"    For awhile Mr. Britling showed Mr. Direck English lanes, and then came  back along narrow white paths across small fields of rising wheat, to  the village and a little gate that led into the park.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Direck, \"what you say about domestication does seem to  me to be very true indeed. Why! even those clouds up there look as  though they had a shepherd and were grazing.\"    \"Ready for shearing almost,\" said Mr. Britling.    \"Indeed,\" said Mr. Direck, raising his voice a little, \"I've seen  scarcely anything in England that wasn't domesticated, unless it was  some of your back streets in London.\"    Mr. Britling seemed to reflect for a moment. \"They're an excrescence,\"  he said....      Section 3    The park had a trim wildness like nature in an old Italian picture;  dappled fallow deer grouped close at hand and looked at the two men  fearlessly; the path dropped through oak trees and some stunted bracken  to a little loitering stream, that paused ever and again to play at  ponds and waterfalls and bear a fleet of water-lily leaves; and then  their way curved round in an indolent sweep towards the cedars and  shrubberies of the great house. The house looked low and extensive to an  American eye, and its red-brick chimneys rose like infantry in open  order along its extended line. There was a glimpse of flower-bright  garden and terraces to the right as they came round the corner to the  front of the house through a path cut in the laurel bushes.    Mr. Britling had a moment of exposition as they approached the entrance.    \"I expect we shall find Philbert from the Home Office--or is it the  Local Government Board?--and Sir Thomas Loot, the Treasury man. There  may be some other people of that sort, the people we call the Governing  Class. Wives also. And I rather fancy the Countess of Frensham is  coming, she's strong on the Irish Question, and Lady Venetia  Trumpington, who they say is a beauty--I've never seen her. It's Lady  Homartyn's way to expect me to come in--not that I'm an important item  at these week-end social feasts--but she likes to see me on the  table--to be nibbled at if any one wants to do so--like the olives and  the salted almonds. And she always asks me to lunch on Sunday and I  always refuse--because of the hockey. So you see I put in an appearance  on the Saturday afternoon....\"    They had reached the big doorway.    It opened into a large cool hall adorned with the heads of hippopotami  and rhinoceroses and a stuffed lion, and furnished chiefly with a vast  table on which hats and sticks and newspapers were littered. A  manservant with a subdued, semi-confidential manner, conveyed to Mr.  Britling that her ladyship was on the terrace, and took the hats and  sticks that were handed to him and led the way through the house. They  emerged upon a broad terrace looking out under great cedar trees upon  flower beds and stone urns and tennis lawns and yew hedges that dipped  to give a view of distant hills. On the terrace were grouped perhaps a  dozen people for the most part holding teacups, they sat in deck chairs  and folding seats about a little table that bore the tea-things. Lady  Homartyn came forward to welcome the newcomers.    Mr. Direck was introduced as a travelling American gratified to see a  typical English country house, and Lady Homartyn in an habituated way  ran over the points of her Tudor specimen. Mr. Direck was not accustomed  to titled people, and was suddenly in doubt whether you called a  baroness \"My Lady\" or \"Your Ladyship,\" so he wisely avoided any form of  address until he had a lead from Mr. Britling. Mr. Britling presently  called her \"Lady Homartyn.\" She took Mr. Direck and sat him down beside  a lady whose name he didn't catch, but who had had a lot to do with the  British Embassy at Washington, and then she handed Mr. Britling over to  the Rt. Honble. George Philbert, who was anxious to discuss certain  points in the latest book of essays. The conversation of the lady from  Washington was intelligent but not exacting, and Mr. Direck was able to  give a certain amount of attention to the general effect of the scene.    He was a little disappointed to find that the servants didn't wear  livery. In American magazine pictures and in American cinematograph  films of English stories and in the houses of very rich Americans living  in England, they do so. And the Mansion House is misleading; he had met  a compatriot who had recently dined at the Mansion House, and who had  described \"flunkeys\" in hair-powder and cloth of gold--like Thackeray's  Jeames Yellowplush. But here the only servants were two slim, discreet  and attentive young gentlemen in black coats with a gentle piety in  their manner instead of pride. And he was a little disappointed too by a  certain lack of splendour in the company. The ladies affected him as  being ill-dressed; there was none of the hard snap, the \"_There!_ and  what do you say to it?\" about them of the well-dressed American woman,  and the men too were not so much tailored as unobtrusively and yet  grammatically clothed.      Section 4    He was still only in the fragmentary stage of conversation when  everything was thrown into commotion by the important arrival of Lady  Frensham, and there was a general reshuffling of places. Lady Frensham  had arrived from London by automobile; she appeared in veils and  swathings and a tremendous "]]]
