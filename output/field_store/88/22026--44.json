Storm bars the harbour,  And snow keeps the pass                                                   5  In the blue mountains.    Bitter the wind whistles,  Pale is the sun,  And the days shorten.    Close to the hearthstone,                                                10  With long thoughts of thee,  Thy lonely lover    Sits now, remembering  All the spent hours  And thy fair beauty.                                                     15    Ah, when the hyacinth  Wakens with spring,  And buds the laurel,    Doubt not, some morning  When all earth revives,                                                  20  Hearing Pan's flute-call    Over the river-beds,  Over the hills,  Sounding the summons,    I shall look up and behold                                               25  In the door,  Smiling, expectant,    Loving as ever  And glad as of old,  My own lost Atthis!                                                      30          XC      A sad, sad face, and saddest eyes that ever    Beheld the sun,  Whence came the grief that makes of all thy beauty    One sad sweet smile?    In this bright portrait, where the painter fixed them,                    5    I still behold  The eyes that gladdened, and the lips that loved me,    And, gold on rose,    The cloud of hair that settles on one shoulder    Slipped from its vest.                                                 10  I almost hear thy Mitylenean love-song    In the spring night,    When the still air was odorous with blossoms,    And in the hour  Thy first wild girl's-love trembled into being,                          15    Glad, glad and fond.    Ah, where is all that wonder? What god's malice    Undid that joy  And set the seal of patient woe upon thee,    O my lost love?                                                        20          XCI      Why have the gods in derision  Severed us, heart of my being?  Where have they lured thee to wander,    O my lost lover?    While now I sojourn with sorrow,                                          5  Having remorse for my comrade,  What town is blessed with thy beauty,    Gladdened and prospered?    Nay, who could love as I loved thee,  With whom thy beauty was mingled                                         10  In those spring days when the swallows    Came with the south wind?    Then I became as that shepherd  Loved by Selene on Latmus,  Once when her own summer magic                                           15    Took hold upon her    With a sweet madness, and thenceforth  Her mortal lover must wander  Over the wide world for ever,    Like one enchanted.                                                    20          XCII      Like a red lily in the meadow grasses,  Swayed by the wind and burning in the sunlight,  I saw you, where the city chokes with traffic,  Bearing among the passers-by your beauty,  Unsullied, wild, and delicate as a flower.                                5  And then I knew, past doubt or peradventure,  Our loved and mighty Eleusinian mother  Had taken thought of me for her pure worship,  And of her favour had assigned my comrade  For the Great Mysteries,--knew I should find you                         10  When the dusk murmured with its new-made lovers,  And we be no more foolish but wise children,  And well content partake of joy together,  As she ordains and human hearts desire.          XCIII      When in the spring the swallows all return,  And the bleak bitter sea grows mild once more,  With all its thunders softened to a sigh;    When to the meadows the young green comes back,  And swelling buds put forth on every bough,                               5  With wild-wood odours on the delicate air;    Ah, then, in that so lovely earth wilt thou  With all thy beauty love me all one way,  And make me all thy lover as before?    Lo, where the white-maned horses of the surge,                           10  Plunging in thunderous onset to the shore,  Trample and break and charge along the sand!          XCIV      Cold is the wind where Daphne sleeps,  That was so tender and so warm  With loving,--with a loveliness  Than her own laurel lovelier.    Now pipes the bitter wind for her,                                        5  And the snow sifts about her door,  While far below her frosty hill  The racing billows plunge and boom.          XCV      Hark, where Poseidon's  White racing horses  Trample with tumult  The shelving seaboard!    Older than Saturn,                                                        5  Older than Rhea,  That mournful music,  Falling and surging    With the vast rhythm  Ceaseless, eternal,                                                      10  Keeps the long tally  Of all things mortal.    How many lovers  Hath not its lulling  Cradled to slumber  With the ripe flowers,                                                   15    Ere for our pleasure  This golden summer  Walked through the corn-lands  In gracious splendour!                                                   20    How many loved ones  Will it not croon to,  In the long spring-days  Through coming ages,    When all our day-dreams                                                  25  Have been forgotten,  And none remembers  Even thy beauty!    They too shall slumber  In quiet places,                                                         30  And mighty sea-sounds  Call them unheeded.          XCVI      Hark, my lover, it is spring!  On the wind a faint far call  Wakes a pang within my heart,  Unmistakable and keen.    At the harbour mouth a sail                                               5  Glimmers in the morning sun,  And the ripples at her prow  Whiten into crumbling foam,    As she forges outward bound  For the teeming foreign ports.                                           10  Through the open window now,  Hear the sailors lift a song!    In the meadow ground the frogs  With their deafening flutes begin,--  The old madness of the world                                             15  In their golden throats again.    Little fifers of live bronze,  Who hath taught you with wise lore  To unloose the strains of joy,  When Orion seeks the west?                                               20    And you feathered flute-players,  Who instructed you to fill  All the blossomy orchards now  With melodious desire?    I doubt not our father Pan                                               25  Hath a care of all these things.  In some valley of the hills  Far away and misty-blue,    By quick water he hath cut  A new pipe, and set the wood                                             30  To his smiling lips, and blown,  That earth's rapture be restored.    And those wild Pandean stops  Mark the cadence life must keep.  O my lover, be thou glad;                                                35  It is spring in Hellas now.          XCVII      When the early soft spring wind comes blowing  Over Rhodes and Samos and Miletus,  From the seven mouths of Nile to Lesbos,  Freighted with sea-odours and gold sunshine,    What news spreads among the island people                                 5  In the market-place of Mitylene,  Lending that unwonted stir of gladness  To the busy streets and thronging doorways?    Is it word from Ninus or Arbela,  Babylon the great, or Northern Imbros?                                   10  Have the laden galleons been sighted  Stoutly labouring up the sea from Tyre?    Nay, 'tis older news that foreign sailor  With the cheek of sea-tan stops to prattle  To the young fig-seller with her basket                                  15  And the breasts that bud beneath her tunic,    And I hear it in the rustling tree-tops.  All this passionate bright tender body  Quivers like a leaf the wind has shaken,  Now love wanders through the aisles of springtime.                       20          XCVIII      I am more tremulous than shaken reeds,  And love has made me like the river water.    Thy voice is as the hill-wind over me,  And all my changing heart gives heed, my lover.    Before thy least lost murmur I must sigh,                                 5  Or gladden with thee as the sun-path glitters.          XCIX      Over the wheat-field,  Over the hill-crest,  Swoops and is gone  The beat of a wild wing,  Brushing the pine-tops,                                                   5  Bending the poppies,  Hurrying Northward  With golden summer.    What premonition,  O purple swallow,                                                        10  Told thee the happy  Hour of migration?  Hark! On the threshold  (Hush, flurried heart in me!),  Was there a footfall?                                                    15  Did no one enter?    Soon will a shepherd  In rugged Dacia,  Folding his gentle  Ewes in the twilight,                                                    20  Lifting a level  Gaze from the sheepfold,  Say to his fellows,  \"Lo, it is springtime.\"    This very hour                                                           25  In Mitylene,  Will not a young girl  Say to her lover,  Lifting her moon-white  Arms to enlace him,                                                      30  Ere the glad sigh comes,  \"Lo, it is lovetime!\"          C      Once more the rain on the mountain,  Once more the wind in the valley,  With the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#7)"],[1,"him--yes--I love Joe--he has mastered me. Yet I wish he  were--like Jim--Jim who looked at me--so--with his deep eyes--and  I. . . .\"    Joe lifted her as if she were a baby, and carrying her down to the  raft, gently laid her by her sleeping sister.    The innocent words which he should not have heard were like a blow.  What she would never have acknowledged in her waking hours had been  revealed in her dreams. He recalled the glance of Jim's eyes as it  had rested on Nell many times that day, and now these things were  most significant.    He found at the end of the island a great, mossy stone. On this he  climbed, and sat where the moonlight streamed upon him. Gradually  that cold bitterness died out from his face, as it passed from his  heart, and once more he became engrossed in the silver sheen on the  water, the lapping of the waves on the pebbly beach, and in that  speaking, mysterious silence of the woods.                    *       *       *    When the first faint rays of red streaked over the eastern  hill-tops, and the river mist arose from the water in a vapory  cloud, Jeff Lynn rolled out of his blanket, stretched his long  limbs, and gave a hearty call to the morning. His cheerful welcome  awakened all the voyagers except Joe, who had spent the night in  watching and the early morning in fishing.    \"Wal, I'll be darned,\" ejaculated Jeff as he saw Joe. \"Up afore me,  an' ketched a string of fish.\"    \"What are they?\" asked Joe, holding up several bronze-backed fish.    \"Bass--black bass, an' thet big feller is a lammin' hefty 'un. How'd  ye ketch 'em?\"    \"I fished for them.\"    \"Wal, so it 'pears,\" growled Jeff, once more reluctantly yielding to  his admiration for the lad. \"How'd ye wake up so early?\"    \"I stayed up all night. I saw three deer swim from the mainland, but  nothing else came around.\"    \"Try yer hand at cleanin' 'em fer breakfast,\" continued Jeff,  beginning to busy himself with preparations for that meal. \"Wal,  wal, if he ain't surprisin'! He'll do somethin' out here on the  frontier, sure as I'm a born sinner,\" he muttered to himself,  wagging his head in his quaint manner.    Breakfast over, Jeff transferred the horses to the smaller raft,  which he had cut loose from his own, and, giving a few directions to  Bill, started down-stream with Mr. Wells and the girls.    The rafts remained close together for a while, but as the current  quickened and was more skillfully taken advantage of by Jeff, the  larger raft gained considerable headway, gradually widening the gap  between the two.    All day they drifted. From time to time Joe and Jim waved their  hands to the girls; but the greater portion of their attention was  given to quieting the horses. Mose, Joe's big white dog, retired in  disgust to the hut, where he watched and dozed by turns. He did not  fancy this kind of voyaging. Bill strained his sturdy arms all day  on the steering-oar.    About the middle of the afternoon Joe observed that the hills grew  more rugged and precipitous, and the river ran faster. He kept a  constant lookout for the wall of rock which marked the point of  danger. When the sun had disappeared behind the hills, he saw ahead  a gray rock protruding from the green foliage. It was ponderous,  overhanging, and seemed to frown down on the river. This was Shawnee  Rock. Joe looked long at the cliff, and wondered if there was now an  Indian scout hidden behind the pines that skirted the edge.  Prominent on the top of the bluff a large, dead tree projected its  hoary, twisted branches.    Bill evidently saw the landmark, for he stopped in his monotonous  walk to and fro across the raft, and pushing his oar amidships he  looked ahead for the other raft. The figure of the tall frontiersman  could be plainly seen as he labored at the helm.    The raft disappeared round a bend, and as it did so Joe saw a white  scarf waved by Nell.    Bill worked the clumsy craft over toward the right shore where the  current was more rapid. He pushed with all his strength, and when  the oar had reached its widest sweep, he lifted it and ran back  across the raft for another push. Joe scanned the river ahead. He  saw no rapids; only rougher water whirling over some rocks. They  were where the channel narrowed and ran close to the right-hand  bank. Under a willow-flanked ledge was a sand-bar. To Joe there  seemed nothing hazardous in drifting through this pass.    \"Bad place ahead,\" said Bill, observing Joe's survey of the river.    \"It doesn't look so,\" replied Joe.    \"A raft ain't a boat. We could pole a boat. You has to hev water to  float logs, an' the river's run out considerable. I'm only afeerd  fer the horses. If we hit or drag, they might plunge around a bit.\"    When the raft passed into the head of the bend it struck the rocks  several times, but finally gained the channel safely, and everything  seemed propitious for an easy passage.    But, greatly to Bill's surprise, the wide craft was caught directly  in the channel, and swung round so that the steering-oar pointed  toward the opposite shore. The water roared a foot deep over the  logs.    \"Hold hard on the horses!\" yelled Bill. \"Somethin's wrong. I never  seen a snag here.\"    The straining mass of logs, insecurely fastened together, rolled and  then pitched loose again, but the short delay had been fatal to the  steering apparatus.    Joe would have found keen enjoyment in the situation, had it not  been for his horse, Lance. The thoroughbred was difficult to hold.  As Bill was making strenuous efforts to get in a lucky stroke of the  oar, he failed to see a long length of grapevine floating like a  brown snake of the water below. In the excitement they heeded not  the barking of Mose. Nor did they see the grapevine straighten and  become taut just as they drifted upon it; but they felt the raft  strike and hold on some submerged object. It creaked and groaned and  the foamy water surged, gurgling, between the logs.    Jim's mare snorted with terror, and rearing high, pulled her halter  loose and plunged into the river. But Jim still held her, at risk of  being drawn overboard.    \"Let go! She'll drag you in!\" yelled Joe, grasping him with his free  hand. Lance trembled violently and strained at the rope, which his  master held with a strong grip.    CRACK!    The stinging report of a rifle rang out above the splashing of the  water.    Without a cry, Bill's grasp on the oar loosened; he fell over it  limply, his head striking the almost submerged log. A dark-red fluid  colored the water; then his body slipped over the oar and into the  river, where it sank.    \"My God! Shot!\" cried Jim, in horrified tones.    He saw a puff of white smoke rising above the willows. Then the  branches parted, revealing the dark forms of several Indian  warriors. From the rifle in the foremost savage's hand a slight veil  of smoke rose. With the leap of a panther the redskin sprang from  the strip of sand to the raft.    \"Hold, Jim! Drop that ax! We're caught!\" cried Joe.    \"It's that Indian from the fort!\" gasped Jim.    The stalwart warrior was indeed Silvertip. But how changed! Stripped  of the blanket he had worn at the settlement, now standing naked but  for his buckskin breech-cloth, with his perfectly proportioned form  disclosed in all its sinewy beauty, and on his swarthy, evil face an  expression of savage scorn, he surely looked a warrior and a chief.    He drew his tomahawk and flashed a dark glance at Joe. For a moment  he steadily regarded the young man; but if he expected to see fear  in the latter's face he was mistaken, for the look was returned  coolly.    \"Paleface steal shirt,\" he said in his deep voice. \"Fool paleface  play--Silvertip no forget.\"        Chapter V.    Silvertip turned to his braves, and giving a brief command, sprang  from the raft. The warriors closed in around the brothers; two  grasping each by the arms, and the remaining Indian taking care of  the horse. The captives were then led ashore, where Silvertip  awaited them.    When the horse was clear of the raft, which task necessitated  considerable labor on the part of the Indians, the chief seized the  grapevine, that was now plainly in sight, and severed it with one  blow of his tomahawk. The raft dashed forward with a lurch and  drifted downstream.    In the clear water Joe could see the cunning trap which had caused  the death of Bill, and insured the captivity of himself and his  brother. The crafty savages had trimmed a six-inch sapling and  anchored it under the water. They weighted the heavy end, leaving  the other pointing upstream. To this last had been tied the  grapevine. When the drifting raft reached the sapling, the Indians  concealed in the willows pulled hard on the improvised rope; the end  of the sapling stuck up like a hook, and the aft was caught and  held. The killing of the helmsman showed the Indians' foresight;  even had the raft drifted on downstream the brothers would have been  helpless on a craft they could not manage. After all, Joe thought,  he had not been so far wrong when he half fancied that an Indian lay  behind Shawnee Rock, and he marveled at this clever trick which had  so easily effected their capture.    But he had little time to look around at the scene of action. There  was a moment only in which to study the river to learn if the  unfortunate raftsman's body had appeared. It was not to be seen. The  river ran swiftly and hid all evidence of the tragedy under its  smooth surface. When the brave who had gone back to the raft for the  goods joined his companion the two hurried Joe up the bank after the  others.    Once upon level ground Joe saw before him an open forest. On the  border of this the Indians stopped long enough to bind the  prisoners' wrists with thongs of deerhide. While two of the braves  performed this office, Silvertip leaned against a tree and took no  notice of the brothers. When they were thus securely tied one of  their "]]]
