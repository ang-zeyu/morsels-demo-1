[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#7)"],[1,"   Dr. Arthur Conly rode briskly up the avenue at Roselands, dismounted,  throwing the bridle to a servant, and went up the steps into the veranda,  whistling softly to himself.    \"You seem in good spirits, Art,\" remarked Calhoun, who sat there with the  morning paper in his hand. \"I haven't heard you whistle before for--well I  should say something like a fortnight.\"    \"I am in good spirits, Cal, the Ion children are out of danger, and uncle  has just had a telegram from Ned announcing the safe arrival of their  party in New York in good season to take the steamer.\"    \"I presume this tells the same story, though I can't think why it isn't  directed to grandpa, or to me as the eldest son of the house,\" Calhoun  said, handing an unopened telegram to his brother.    Arthur tore it hastily open, glanced at the contents and paled to the very  lips.    \"What is it?\" cried Calhoun in alarm.    \"Mother!\" said Arthur huskily, putting the paper into his brother's  outstretched hand. \"She has been struck down with apoplexy. Cal, I must  take the first train for New York. Look at the paper, see when it leaves.  Thank God that those children are out of danger! But I must see whom I can  get to take charge of them and my other patients during my absence.\"    Then calling to a servant he directed a fresh horse to be saddled and  brought to the door with all speed, and hurrying into the house, summoned  his old mammy and bade her pack a valise with such clothing as he would  need on a journey to the North which might occupy a week or more.    \"You are acting very promptly,\" Calhoun said, following him in to give the  desired information in regard to the train.    \"Yes, there's not a minute to lose, Cal.\"    Calhoun's face was full of grief and anxiety. \"I think I should go, too,  Art, if--if you think there's any probability of--finding her alive.\"    \"It's impossible to tell. But we can hardly both be spared from home. It  should be kept from grandpa as long as possible, and if he saw us both  rushing off in the direction she has taken, he would know at once that  something very serious had happened her.\"    \"Yes, you are right, and for the first time I envy you your medical  knowledge and skill. She's with Virginia, the message is sent by her,\"  glancing again at the paper which he still held in his hand. \"I'm glad of  that--that she has at least one of her children with her, if----\"    He paused and Arthur finished the sentence. \"If she will be of any use or  comfort to her, you were about to say? Well, we can only hope that so  terrible an emergency has developed some hitherto unsuspected excellencies  in Virginia's character.\"    A horse came galloping up the avenue. Calhoun glanced from the window.    \"Another telegram!\" he cried, and both brothers dashed out upon the  veranda.    This was directed to Calhoun, sent from Philadelphia by their uncle Edward  Allison. He and Adelaide would be with Mrs. Conly in two hours, telegraph  at once in what condition they found her, and if practicable start with  her immediately for her home.    The brothers consulted together, and Arthur decided to go on with his  preparations, but delay setting out upon his journey until the coming of  the promised message.    It came in due time, and from it they learned that their mother was  already on her way home.    The sad tidings had now to be communicated to the other near relatives,  but it was deemed best to keep them from the younger children and the  feeble old father until the day when she might be expected to arrive.    As gently and tenderly as possible the old gentleman's son broke the news  to him.    He was much overcome. \"She will never get over it, I fear,\" he sighed, the  tears coursing down his furrowed cheeks. \"One bereavement is apt to tread  closely upon the heels of another, and she will probably soon follow her  sister. But oh if I only knew that she had been washed from her sins in  the precious blood of Christ, that she had accepted His invitation, 'Come  unto me,' so that death would be but falling asleep in Him, safe in His  arms, safe on His gentle breast--I think I could let her go almost  willingly, for my race is well nigh run, and it can hardly be long ere I  too shall get my summons home.\"    \"Dear father, if such be the will of God, may you be spared to us for many  years yet,\" returned his son with emotion. \"And Louise! We do not know her  exact condition, but let us hope that God will in His great mercy give her  yet more time--months or years--in which to prepare for eternity. We will  cry earnestly for her, and in the name of Christ, to Him who hath said, 'I  have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth,' but bids them 'Turn  yourselves and live ye.'\"    \"Yes; and whose promise is, 'If two of you shall agree on earth, as  touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my  Father which is in heaven!'\"    Silence fell between them for a moment, then the old gentleman asked,  \"What arrangements have the boys made? She will hardly be able to drive  home in a carriage.\"    \"Oh no! they will meet her at the depot with an ambulance, and I shall be  there with the carriage for Mr. Allison, Adelaide, and Virginia.\"    \"Virginia is coming too?\"    \"We do not know certainly, but expect to see her with the others.\"    \"I cannot say that I hope you will. I never saw a more useless person; she  will be only in the way; and--I cannot banish a suspicion that she has  brought this attack upon her poor mother. I strongly suspect that  Virginia's match has turned out a very bad one, and that she has heaped  reproaches upon her mother for the hand she had in bringing it about.\"    \"I hope not!\" his son exclaimed with energy; \"for if so it must surely be  the cause of life-long self-reproach to her. Will you go with us to the  depot, father?\"    \"No, no, my son! let my first sight of my poor stricken child be where we  will not be the gazing stock of an idle, curious crowd. I shall meet her  here at my own door.\"    The train steamed into the depot, and Mrs. Allison, glancing from a window  of the parlor-car, saw her brother and nephews standing near the track.    They saw her, too, and lifted their hats with a sad sort of smile. All  felt that the invalid must be unable to sit up or her face also would have  been in sight.    In another moment the train had come to a stand-still, and the next the  three gentlemen were beside the couch on which Mrs. Conly lay.    She looked up at her sons with eyes full of intelligence, made an effort  to speak, but in vain; and the big tears rolled down her cheeks.    They bent over her with hearts and eyes full to overflowing.    \"Mother, dear mother, we are glad you have come to us alive,\" Calhoun said  in low, tremulous tones.    \"And we hope we shall soon have you much better,\" added Arthur.    \"Yes,\" said Adelaide, \"she is already better than when we first saw her in  New York, but has not yet recovered her speech and can not help herself  at all. One side seems to be quite paralyzed.\"    \"We have an ambulance waiting,\" said Calhoun. \"As soon as the crowd is out  of the way it shall be brought close to the platform of this car and we  will lift her into it.\"    Greetings were exchanged while they waited.    \"Where is Virginia?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore.    \"She preferred to remain behind,\" replied Mrs. Allison in a low-toned  aside, \"and as she would have been of no use whatever, we did not urge her  to come.\"    \"It is just as well,\" was Mr. Dinsmore's comment.    Very tenderly and carefully the poor invalid was lifted and placed in the  ambulance by her sons and brothers. The former accompanied her in it,  while the latter, with Mrs. Allison, entered the Roselands family  carriage, and drove thither considerably in advance of the more slowly  moving ambulance.    \"Has Virginia made a really good match?\" Mr. Dinsmore asked, addressing  his sister Adelaide.    \"Good! it could hardly be worse!\" she exclaimed. \"Would you have believed  it? we found them in a tenement-house, living most wretchedly.\"    \"Is it possible! He was not wealthy then? Or has he lost his means since  the marriage?\"    \"As far as I can learn,\" said Mr. Allison, \"he has always lived by his  wits; he is a professional gambler now.\"    \"Dreadful! How does he treat his wife?\"    \"Very badly indeed, if we may credit her story. They live, as the saying  is, like cat and dog, actually coming to blows at times. They are both  bitterly disappointed, each having married the other merely for money;  which neither had.\"    Mr. Dinsmore looked greatly concerned. \"Virginia was never a favorite of  mine,\" he remarked, \"but I do not like to think of her as suffering from  either poverty or the abusive treatment of a bad husband. Can nothing be  done to better her condition?\"    \"I think not at present,\" said Adelaide; \"she has made her bed and will  have to lie in it. I don't believe the man would ever proceed to personal  violence if she did not exasperate him with taunts and reproaches; with  slaps, scratches, and hair pulling also, he says.\"    \"O disgraceful!\" exclaimed her uncle. \"I have no pity for her if she is  really guilty of such conduct.\"    \"She told me herself that on one occasion she actually threw a cup of  coffee in his face in return for his accusation that she and her mother  had inveigled him into the marriage by pretences to wealth they did not  possess. Poor Louise! I have no doubt her attack was brought on by the  discovery of the great mistake she and Virginia had made, and reproaches  heaped on her for her share in making the match.\"    \"'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap,'\" sighed Mr. Dinsmore.  \"I presume Virginia was too proud to show herself here among relatives  whose approval of the match had not been asked, and acquaintances who had  heard of it as a splendid affair?\"    \"Your conjecture is entirely correct,\" said Adelaide. \"She gave vent to  her feelings on the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#7)"],[1," \"You're  all right, old fellow!\"    But the dog backed off and his nose twitched warningly. He would fight  if these men bothered him. With a final growl of defiance Jan left the  stable, but he carried with him a new sense of power. He could make  people let him alone if he snarled and showed his teeth.    That night he prowled around until he found the garbage cans. So he  learned to hide in the daytime and forage like a wild animal at night.  If he passed one of the servants, he growled and braced himself stiffly,  while his hair rose in a ridge along his back. One glance at his  bloodshot eyes and big, white teeth was enough to make every one, man,  woman or child, hurry out of his way.    In the excitement of packing for the trip, Elizabeth had neglected to  have Jan's hair clipped. Maybe she told the servants to have it cut.  Now, the long fur heated and worried the dog constantly and the fleas  nearly drove him mad. Day and night, he bit and scratched, tearing out  tufts of matted hair until raw, bleeding spots made his body a mass of  sores. Each day he grew more savage. He hated every one now; the monks  who had sold him, Mr. Pixley who had taken him from the Hospice, Miss  Elizabeth who had deserted him, and the servants who abused him.    \"I wish I could tell the dogs at the Hospice not to help people who are  lost,\" he thought as he lay in the dark. \"If William were lost in the  snow and I found him, I would fasten my teeth in his throat.\"    So, the gentle Prince Jan, whose heart had been full of love and trust,  and who wanted to help every one, became a savage beast, ready to fight  all people and hating even those whom he once had loved and for whom he  would have died gladly.          Chapter VI    THE POUND      Six months went by and the Pixleys had not returned, but Jan did not  know that Mr. Pixley was still very ill. The dog hid or skulked if he  met any person, and his deep growls and twitching nose were so  threatening that no one dared to go nearer. His silky hair was rough and  ragged, raw bleeding spots scarred his body, his eyes were bloodshot and  his tail was almost bare of the long hair that had once made it a  beautiful plume.    His only refuge was the orange grove, where he spent the days sleeping  or licking the bones he stole from garbage pails, for no one ever  thought to put food or water where he could find it. The servants feared  and hated him, and he hated them but did not fear them. He knew his own  strength. If any one threatened to abuse him, Jan was ready to leap and  use his sharp teeth, but so long as people let him alone, he would not  fight.    Late one afternoon, he saw William and a kindly-looking old man with a  long, white beard, talking together. They were watching Jan, as the dog  lay quietly in the hole that was now his only home; his eyes rolled but  he did not lift his head as they came closer.    \"He has no use for me,\" said William, giving a rope to the other man.  \"Maybe you can handle him alone, but I don't believe it. He's as big and  strong as a lion.\"    William pulled a paper from his pocket and held it to the older man,  saying, \"Here's a letter from Miss Elizabeth Pixley; you can see what  she says. I wrote her about Jan and asked what we should do with him.\"    The name of Elizabeth caused Jan's ears to prick up and the fierce light  in his eyes faded. The strange man came close to the dog and spoke  gently. Jan wagged his tail slightly, but kept his eyes on the old man's  face.    \"You had better look out,\" warned William. \"He can't be trusted a  minute.\"    Jan glared at the stableman. \"I wanted to love and help people, not hurt  them, until you made me fight,\" he growled.    \"Look out!\" cried William. \"He's showing his teeth. He is the worst dog  I have ever seen in my life.\"    The older man studied the dog silently, then smiled and held out his  hand. Jan shrank back suspiciously but allowed the hand to touch his  back.    \"I think I can manage him,\" said the stranger, then he added, \"Come,  Jan. Come with me!\"    The dog rose to his feet and followed unresistingly down the pathway to  the front of the Pixley home, and past the lawn where he had spent so  many happy hours, along the firm sand on which he had so often raced  beside his mistress's pony in the days gone by. And as he trudged  slowly, he kept wondering if she had sent for him. He remembered how Mr.  Pixley had led him away from the Hospice at the end of a rope, but at  the end of the journey Jan had found Elizabeth and happiness. He lifted  his big head and his anxious eyes saw a pitying face as a gentle hand  lightly touched his back. It was quite a long walk and the dog was weak  from improper food and care. When they entered a little cottage, the old  man brought food and water, then sat and watched the dog devour them  ravenously. After the dish had been emptied of all food, Jan stood  wagging his tail to show his gratitude. The old man laughed.    \"Why, you're not any more vicious than I am, Prince Jan! But, you're in  pretty bad shape.\"    He did not tie the rope, but let it drop on the floor while he brought a  small tin tub full of warm suds, and gently sponged the dog's body. The  next thing was cool salve on the painful sores.    Then Jan was ready to follow this kind friend, and though his legs  trembled with weakness, he hastened with the old man into a large room  with dirt floor. It was late in the afternoon and the light from two  small windows left the place in partial darkness, so that Jan, coming  into it, could not see anything at first. But, he heard dogs whining and  barking all about him. When he grew accustomed to the dim light, the old  man had tied him and gone away.    A number of dogs were fastened by short ropes, and all were staring at  the big dog. Shrill yapping made Jan turn quickly to see a tiny, dirty  dog with long hair that had once been white but now was matted and  grimed, straining on its rope and squinting impudently at him.    \"Gracious! You're the biggest dog I ever saw!\" exclaimed the midget,  which was not much larger than a small kitten. \"What is your name, and  where on earth did you come from?\"    Prince Jan answered politely, then asked, \"Is this the kennel where they  train dogs to help people in the Land of No Snow?\"    \"You must be crazy! This is the pound!\" snapped the tiny creature,  thinking Jan was making fun of it.    \"The pound?\" echoed Prince Jan. \"What is that?\"    \"Silly! You haven't much sense, even if you are so big! If the  dog-catchers get us they bring us to the pound, and if our folks don't  come for us pretty soon, we are all shot!\"    Several dogs howled in despair, but the snippy little animal only  stretched out for a nap.    \"Don't you feel badly, too?\" questioned Jan.    \"Good gracious, no! I travel around with my folks and we live in hotels,  and they make me wear a collar. I manage to get away without my collar,  sometimes, and some one always takes me to the pound, and my family come  there for me as soon as I am lost. They'll be here for me before long.  I've been in lots of pounds.\"    [Illustration: \"'_You must be crazy! this is the pound!' snapped the  tiny creature._\"]    Without further remarks, the spoiled pet curled itself into a dirty  ball and was fast asleep when the door opened and two young ladies  rushed in and grabbed up the blinking rascal. He yawned in the face of  the girl who held him; then, petted and scolded, he was carried away.    With hopeless eyes, Jan watched them pass through the doorway. He  understood now, that Elizabeth had not sent for him, that nobody cared  what happened to him. He lay down and shut his eyes and tried to shut  his ears to the misery of the other dogs, but he could not sleep. Jan  kept thinking how he had wanted to do what was right and how hard he had  tried to remember what his mother had taught him. In this strange land,  with no snow and no work to do, he had failed; and now, he would die in  disgrace after a useless life that meant dishonour to his father and  Barry, and the other dogs who had lived and died doing their duty as St.  Bernards.    Through the long hours of the night, though darkness shut away the sight  of the other dogs, Jan could hear restless movements and choked  whimpers, so that he could not forget where he was, and at last, when  morning broke, he lifted his head slowly and looked at the dogs around  him. Then he remembered that morning at the Hospice when he had wakened  early, waiting impatiently for his first lesson on the trail. But these  dogs around him, now, were pitiful things, cowering and shivering; the  eyes that met his own were dull and hopeless, and the ears all drooped  dejectedly.    The dogs started nervously as a key scraped in the lock of the door.  Then the old man came into the room and went from one dog to the other,  patting each in turn as he placed clean, freshly cooked meat and a pan  of water within easy reach. The poor animals shrank back, but as they  saw that he did not threaten any of them, the ragged tails flopped and  the eyes that followed him were less timid. When he reached Jan, the man  stood looking at him and shaking his head slowly. The dog, still  suspicious of every human being, bunched his muscles and waited, but the  smile and gentle voice, \"You poor old fellow! I'm afraid I can't do  anything for you,\" made Jan look up with his great, wistful eyes  pleading for sympathy and kindness.    \"I'll do the best I can, though,\" the old man said, at last, as he  untied the rope and turned toward the door.    The dog rose stiffly, for every bone in his gaunt body ached, his legs  trembled from weakness due to lack of proper food, but he moved  trustingly beside this kindly stranger. As they reached once more the  door of the little house where Jan had been washed and fed the night  before, the wrinkled hand holding the rope reached out and Prince Jan's  hot tongue touched it in a light"]]]
