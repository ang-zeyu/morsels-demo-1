The  base of the candelabrum is a tripod, on which stands a group of three  female figures; representing Law, Justice, and Poetry, the two former  modeled from Flaxman's sculpture on Lord Mansfield's monument in  Westminster Abbey, the latter from a drawing of the Greek Antique,  bearing a scroll inscribed with the word \"Ion\" in Greek characters.  The arms of Mr. Talfourd and of the borough of Reading are engraved on  the base. The testimonial was presented to the Justice in the presence  of his family, including the venerable Mrs. Talfourd, his mother,  and a large circle of private friends. In answer to the gentleman who  presented the testimonial, Mr. Talfourd replied:    \"If I felt that the circumstances of this hour, and the eloquent  kindness which has enriched it, appealed for a response only to  personal qualities, I should be too conscious of the poverty of such  materials for an answer to attempt one; but the associations they  suggest expand into wider circles than self impels, and while they  teach me that this occasion is not for the indulgence of vanity,  but for the cultivation of humble thankfulness, they impart a nobler  significance to your splendid gift and to your delightful praise. They  remind me that my intellectual being has, from its first development,  been nurtured by the partiality of those whom, living and dead, you  virtually represent to-day; they concentrate the wide-spread instances  of that peculiar felicity in my lot whereby I have been privileged to  find aid, comfort, inspiration, and allowance in that local community  amidst which my life began; and they invite me, from that position  which once bounded my furthest horizon of personal hope, to live along  the line of past existence; to recognize the same influence everywhere  pervading it: and to perceive how its struggles have been assisted;  its errors softened down or vailed, and its successes enhanced, by the  constant presence of home-born regards. Embracing in a rapid glance  the events of many years, I call to mind how at an early age--earlier  than is generally safe or happy for youths--the incidents of life,  supplying an unusual stimulus to ordinary powers, gave vividness to  those dreams of human excellence and progress which, at some time,  visit all; how by the weakness which precluded them from assuming  those independent shapes which require the plastic force of higher  powers, they became associated with the scenes among which they were  cherished, and clove to them with earnest grasp; and how the fervid  expressions which that combination prompted, were accepted by generous  friends as indicating faculties 'beyond the reaches of my soul,'  and induced them to encourage me by genial prophecies which, with  unwearied purpose, they endeavored to fulfill. I renew that golden  season when such vague aspirations were at once cherished and  directed by the Christian wisdom of the venerated master of Reading  School--who, during his fifty years of authority, made the name of  our town a household word to successive generations of scholars,  who honored him in all parts of the world, and all departments of  society--whose long life was one embodied charity--and who gave  steadiness and object to those impulses in me which else might have  ended, as they began, in dreams. I remember, when pausing on the  slippery threshold of active life, and looking abroad on the desolate  future, how the earnestness of my friends gave me courage, and  emboldened me, with no patrons but themselves, to enter the profession  of my choice by its most dim and laborious avenue, and to brace myself  for four years of arduous pupilage; how they crowded with pleasures  the intervals of holiday I annually enjoyed among them during that  period, and another of equal length passed in a special pleader's  anxieties and toils; how they greeted with praise, sweeter than  the applause of multitudes to him who wins it, the slender literary  effusions by which I supplied the deficiency of professional income;  and how, when I dared the hazard of the bar, they provided for me  opportunities such as riper scholars and other advocates wait long  for, by confiding important matters to my untried hands; how they  encircled my first tremulous efforts by an atmosphere of affectionate  interest, roused my faint heart to exertion, absorbed the fever that  hung upon its beatings, and strengthened my first perceptions of  capacity to make my thoughts and impressions intelligible, on the  instant, to the minds of courts and juries. The impulse thus given to  my professional success at Reading, and in the sessions of Berkshire  during twelve years, gradually extended its influence through my  circuit, until it raised me to a position among its members beyond  my deserts and equal to my wishes. Another opening of fortune  soon dawned on me; in the maturity of life I aspired to a seat  in parliament--rather let me say, to _that_ seat which only I  coveted--and then, almost without solicitation, from many surviving  patrons of my childhood, and from the sons of others who inherited the  kindness of their fathers, I received an honor more precious to me as  the token of concentrated regards than as the means of advancement;  yet greatly heightened in practical importance by the testimony  it implied from the best of all witnesses. That honor, three times  renewed, was attended by passages of excitement which look dizzy even  in the distance--with much on my part requiring allowance, and much  allowance rendered by those to whom my utmost services were due; with  the painful consciousness of wide difference of opinion between some  of my oldest friends and myself, and with painful contests which those  differences rendered inevitable, yet cheered by attachments which  the vivid lights struck out in the conflict of contending passions  exhibited in scatheless strength, until I received that appointment  which dissolved the parliamentary connection, and with it annihilated  all the opposition of feeling which had sometimes saddened it, and  invested the close of my life with the old regard, as unclouded by  controversy as when it illumined its opening. And now the expressions  of your sympathy await me, when, by the gracious providence of God,  I have been permitted to enter on a course of less fervid action, of  serener thought, of plainer duty. For me political animosities are  forever hushed and absorbed in one desire, which I share with you  all, for the happiness and honor of our country, and the peaceful  advancement of our species; and all the feverish excitements and  perils of advocacy, its ardent partisanship with various interests,  anxieties, and passions, are displaced by the office of seeking to  discover truth and to maintain justice. I am no longer incited to  aspire to public favor, even under your auspices: my course is marked  right onward--to be steadily trodden, whether its duties may accord  with the prevalent feeling of the hour, or may oppose the temporary  injustice of its generous errors: but it is not forbidden me to prize  the esteem of those who have known me longest and best, and to indulge  the hope that I may retain it to the last. To encourage me in the  aim still to deserve that esteem, I shall look on this gift of those  numbers of my townsmen whose regards have just found such cordial  expression. I shall cherish it as a memorial of earliest hopes  that gleam out from the depth of years; as a memorial of a thousand  incentives to virtuous endeavor, of sacred trusts, of delighted  solaces; as a memorial of affections which have invested a being,  frail, sensitive, and weak, with strength not its own, and under God,  have insured for it an honorable destiny; as a memorial of this hour,  when, in the presence of those who are nearest and dearest to me on  earth, my course has been pictured in the light of those friendships  which have gladdened it--an hour of which the memory and the influence  will not pass away, but, I fondly trust, will incite those who will  bear my name after me, and to whose charge this gift will be confided  when I shall cease to behold it, better to deserve, though they cannot  more dearly appreciate, such a succession of kindnesses as that to  which the crowning grace is now added, and for which, with my whole  heart, I thank you.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Cultivate and exercise a serene faith, and you shall acquire wonderful  power and insight; its results are sure and illimitable, moulding and  moving to its purposes equally spirit, mind, and matter.

Under this head we have rarely to present so many articles as are  demanded by the foreign journals received during the week, and by the  melancholy disaster which caused the death of the MARCHESA D'OSSOLI,  with her husband, and Mr. SUMNER. Of MARGARET FULLER D'OSSOLI a sketch  is given in the preceding pages, and we reserve for our next number  an article upon the history of Sir ROBERT PEEL. The death of this  illustrious person has caused a profound sensation not only in Great  Britain, but throughout Europe. In the House of Lords, most eloquent  and impressive speeches upon the exalted character of the deceased,  and the irreparable loss of the country, were delivered by the Marquis  of Lansdowne, Lord Stanley, Lord Brougham, the Duke of Wellington,  and the Duke of Cleveland, and in the House of Commons, by Lord John  Russell, and Messrs. Hume, Gladstone, Goulburn, Herries, Napier,  Inglis and Somervile. The House, in testimony of its grief, adjourned  without business, an act without precedent, except in case of death  in the royal family. A noble tribute of respect was also paid by the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13647"],[0,"Nonsense Songs (#7)"],[1,"Gosky  Patties.
