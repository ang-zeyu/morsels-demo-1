[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#7)"],[1,", in spite of abilities, which, though  his genius was not yet known, his contemporaries clearly recognised, he  was still a struggling and unsuccessful man: ambitious to rise, for no  unworthy reasons, but needy, in weak health, with careless and expensive  habits, and embarrassed with debt. He had hoped to rise by the favour of  the Queen and for the sake of his father. For some ill-explained reason  he was to the last disappointed. Though she used him \"for matters of  state and revenue,\" she either did not like him, or did not see in him  the servant she wanted to advance. He went on to the last pressing his  uncle, Lord Burghley. He applied in the humblest terms, he made himself  useful with his pen, he got his mother to write for him; but Lord  Burghley, probably because he thought his nephew more of a man of  letters than a sound lawyer and practical public servant, did not care  to bring him forward. From his cousin, Robert Cecil, Bacon received  polite words and friendly assurances. Cecil may have undervalued him, or  have been jealous of him, or suspected him as a friend of Essex; he  certainly gave Bacon good reason to think that his words meant nothing.  Except Essex, and perhaps his brother Antony--the most affectionate and  devoted of brothers--no one had yet recognised all that Bacon was.  Meanwhile time was passing. The vastness, the difficulties, the  attractions of that conquest of all knowledge which he dreamed of, were  becoming greater every day to his thoughts. The law, without which he  could not live, took up time and brought in little. Attendance on the  Court was expensive, yet indispensable, if he wished for place. His  mother was never very friendly, and thought him absurd and extravagant.  Debts increased and creditors grumbled. The outlook was discouraging,  when his friendship with Essex opened to him a more hopeful prospect.    In the year 1593 the Attorney-General's place was vacant, and Essex, who  in that year became a Privy Councillor, determined that Bacon should be  Attorney-General. Bacon's reputation as a lawyer was overshadowed by his  philosophical and literary pursuits. He was thought young for the  office, and he had not yet served in any subordinate place. And there  was another man, who was supposed to carry all English law in his head,  full of rude force and endless precedents, hard of heart and voluble of  tongue, who also wanted it. An Attorney-General was one who would bring  all the resources and hidden subtleties of English law to the service of  the Crown, and use them with thorough-going and unflinching resolution  against those whom the Crown accused of treason, sedition, or invasion  of the prerogative. It is no wonder that the Cecils, and the Queen  herself, thought Coke likely to be a more useful public servant than  Bacon: it is certain what Coke himself thought about it, and what his  estimate was of the man whom Essex was pushing against him. But Essex  did not take up his friend's cause in the lukewarm fashion in which  Burghley had patronised his nephew. There was nothing that Essex pursued  with greater pertinacity. He importuned the Queen. He risked without  scruple offending her. She apparently long shrank from directly refusing  his request. The Cecils were for Coke--the \"_Huddler_\" as Bacon calls  him, in a letter to Essex; but the appointment was delayed. All through  1593, and until April, 1594, the struggle went on.    When Robert Cecil suggested that Essex should be content with the  Solicitor's place for Bacon, \"praying him to be well advised, for if his  Lordship had spoken of that it might have been of easier digestion to  the Queen,\" he turned round on Cecil--         \"Digest me no digesting,\" said the Earl; \"for the Attorneyship is       that I must have for Francis Bacon; and in that I will spend my       uttermost credit, friendship, and authority against whomsoever, and       that whosoever went about to procure it to others, that it should       cost both the mediators and the suitors the setting on before they       came by it. And this be you assured of, Sir Robert,\" quoth the       Earl, \"for now do I fully declare myself; and for your own part,       Sir Robert, I do think much and strange both of my Lord your father       and you, that can have the mind to seek the preferment of a       stranger before so near a kinsman; namely, considering if you weigh       in a balance his parts and sufficiency in any respect with those       of his competitor, excepting only four poor years of admittance,       which Francis Bacon hath more than recompensed with the priority of       his reading; in all other respects you shall find no comparison       between them.\"    But the Queen's disgust at some very slight show of independence on  Bacon's part in Parliament, unforgiven in spite of repeated apologies,  together with the influence of the Cecils and the pressure of so  formidable and so useful a man as Coke, turned the scale against Essex.  In April, 1594, Coke was made Attorney. Coke did not forget the  pretender to law, as he would think him, who had dared so long to  dispute his claims; and Bacon was deeply wounded. \"No man,\" he thought,  \"had ever received a more exquisite disgrace,\" and he spoke of retiring  to Cambridge \"to spend the rest of his life in his studies and  contemplations.\" But Essex was not discouraged. He next pressed eagerly  for the Solicitorship. Again, after much waiting, he was foiled. An  inferior man was put over Bacon's head. Bacon found that Essex, who  could do most things, for some reason could not do this. He himself,  too, had pressed his suit with the greatest importunity on the Queen, on  Burghley, on Cecil, on every one who could help him; he reminded the  Queen how many years ago it was since he first kissed her hand in her  service, and ever since had used his wits to please; but it was all in  vain. For once he lost patience. He was angry with Essex; the Queen's  anger with Essex had, he thought, recoiled on his friend. He was angry  with the Queen; she held his long waiting cheap; she played with him and  amused herself with delay; he would go abroad, and he \"knew her  Majesty's nature, that she neither careth though the whole surname of  the Bacons travelled, nor of the Cecils neither.\" He was very angry  with Robert Cecil; affecting not to believe them, he tells him stories  he has heard of his corrupt and underhand dealing. He writes almost a  farewell letter of ceremonious but ambiguous thanks to Lord Burghley,  hoping that he would impute any offence that Bacon might have given to  the \"complexion of a suitor, and a tired sea-sick suitor,\" and speaking  despairingly of his future success in the law. The humiliations of what  a suitor has to go through torment him: \"It is my luck,\" he writes to  Cecil, \"still to be akin to such things as I neither like in nature nor  would willingly meet with in my course, but yet cannot avoid without  show of base timorousness or else of unkind or suspicious strangeness.\"  And to his friend Fulke Greville he thus unburdens himself:         \"SIR,--I understand of your pains to have visited me, for which I       thank you. My matter is an endless question. I assure you I had       said _Requiesce anima mea_; but I now am otherwise put to my       psalter; _Nolite confidere_. I dare go no further. Her Majesty had       by set speech more than once assured me of her intention to call me       to her service, which I could not understand but of the place I had       been named to. And now whether _invidus homo hoc fecit_; or whether       my matter must be an appendix to my Lord of Essex suit; or whether       her Majesty, pretending to prove my ability, meaneth but to take       advantage of some errors which, like enough, at one time or other I       may commit; or what is it? but her Majesty is not ready to despatch       it. And what though the Master of the Rolls, and my Lord of Essex,       and yourself, and others, think my case without doubt, yet in the       meantime I have a hard condition, to stand so that whatsoever       service I do to her Majesty it shall be thought to be but       _servitium viscatum_, lime-twigs and fetches to place myself; and       so I shall have envy, not thanks. This is a course to quench all       good spirits, and to corrupt every man's nature, which will, I       fear, much hurt her Majesty's service in the end. I have been like       a piece of stuff bespoken in the shop; and if her Majesty will not       take me, it may be the selling by parcels will be more gainful. For       to be, as I told you, like a child following a bird, which when he       is nearest flieth away and lighteth a little before, and then the       child after it again, and so _in infinitum_, I am weary of it; as       also of wearying my good friends, of whom, nevertheless, I hope in       one course or other gratefully to deserve. And so, not forgetting       your business, I leave to trouble you with this idle letter; being       but _justa et moderata querimonia_; for indeed I do confess,       _primus amor_ will not easily be cast off. And thus again I commend       me to you.\"    After one more effort the chase was given up, at least for the moment;  for it was soon resumed. But just now Bacon felt that all the world was  against him. He would retire \"out of the sunshine into the shade.\" One  friend only encouraged him. He did more. He helped him when Bacon most  wanted help, in his straitened and embarrassed \"estate.\" Essex, when he  could do nothing more, gave Bacon an estate worth at least L1800.  Bacon's resolution is recorded in the following letter:         \"IT MAY PLEASE YOUR GOOD LORDSHIP,--I pray God her Majesty's       weighing be not like the weight of a balance, _gravia deorsum levia       sursum_. But I am as far from being altered in devotion towards       her, as I am from distrust that she will be altered in opinion"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#7)"],[1,"by Spain, the Executive is brought to the end of  his effort.    In my annual message of December last I said:      Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents    as belligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral    intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between    the contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party.    I speak not of forcible annexation, for that can not be thought of.    That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression.      Thereupon I reviewed these alternatives in the light of President  Grant's measured words, uttered in 1875, when, after seven years of  sanguinary, destructive, and cruel hostilities in Cuba, he reached the  conclusion that the recognition of the independence of Cuba was  impracticable and indefensible and that the recognition of belligerence  was not warranted by the facts according to the tests of public law.  I commented especially upon the latter aspect of the question, pointing  out the inconveniences and positive dangers of a recognition of  belligerence, which, while adding to the already onerous burdens of  neutrality within our own jurisdiction, could not in any way extend our  influence or effective offices in the territory of hostilities.    Nothing has since occurred to change my view in this regard, and  I recognize as fully now as then that the issuance of a proclamation of  neutrality, by which process the so-called recognition of belligerents  is published, could of itself and unattended by other action accomplish  nothing toward the one end for which we labor--the instant pacification  of Cuba and the cessation of the misery that afflicts the island.    Turning to the question of recognizing at this time the independence  of the present insurgent government in Cuba, we find safe precedents  in our history from an early day. They are well summed up in President  Jackson's message to Congress, December 21, 1836, on the subject of the  recognition of the independence of Texas. He said:      In all the contests that have arisen out of the revolutions of France,    out of the disputes relating to the crowns of Portugal and Spain, out    of the revolutionary movements of those Kingdoms, out of the separation    of the American possessions of both from the European Governments, and    out of the numerous and constantly occurring struggles for dominion in    Spanish America, so wisely consistent with our just principles has been    the action of our Government that we have under the most critical    circumstances avoided all censure and encountered no other evil than    that produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against    whom we have been by force of evidence compelled to decide.      It has thus been made known to the world that the uniform policy and    practice of the United States is to avoid all interference in disputes    which merely relate to the internal government of other nations, and    eventually to recognize the authority of the prevailing party, without    reference to our particular interests and views or to the merits of the    original controversy.             *       *       *       *       *      * * * But on this as on every trying occasion safety is to be found in    a rigid adherence to principle.      In the contest between Spain and her revolted colonies we stood aloof    and waited, not only until the ability of the new States to protect    themselves was fully established, but until the danger of their being    again subjugated had entirely passed away. Then, and not till then, were    they recognized. Such was our course in regard to Mexico herself. * * *    It is true that, with regard to Texas, the civil authority of Mexico has    been expelled, its invading army defeated, the chief of the Republic    himself captured, and all present power to control the newly organized    Government of Texas annihilated within its confines. But, on the other    hand, there is, in appearance at least, an immense disparity of physical    force on the side of Mexico. The Mexican Republic under another    Executive is rallying its forces under a new leader and menacing a fresh    invasion to recover its lost dominion.      Upon the issue of this threatened invasion the independence of Texas    may be considered as suspended, and were there nothing peculiar in the    relative situation of the United States and Texas our acknowledgment    of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regarded as    consistent with that prudent reserve with which we have heretofore    held ourselves bound to treat all similar questions.      Thereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded to consider the risk that there might  be imputed to the United States motives of selfish interest in view of  the former claim on our part to the territory of Texas and of the avowed  purpose of the Texans in seeking recognition of independence as an  incident to the incorporation of Texas in the Union, concluding thus:    Prudence, therefore, seems to dictate that we should still stand aloof  and maintain our present attitude, if not until Mexico itself or one of  the great foreign powers shall recognize the independence of the new  Government, at least until the lapse of time or the course of events  shall have proved beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of  that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the  Government constituted by them. Neither of the contending parties can  justly complain of this course. By pursuing it we are but carrying  out the long-established policy of our Government--a policy which  has secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence  at home.    These are the words of the resolute and patriotic Jackson. They are  evidence that the United States, in addition to the test imposed by  public law as the condition of the recognition of independence by a  neutral state (to wit, that the revolted state shall \"constitute in fact  a body politic, having a government in substance as well as in name,  possessed of the elements of stability,\" and forming _de facto_,  \"if left to itself, a state among the nations, reasonably capable of  discharging the duties of a state\"), has imposed for its own governance  in dealing with cases like these the further condition that recognition  of independent statehood is not due to a revolted dependency until the  danger of its being again subjugated by the parent state has entirely  passed away.    This extreme test was, in fact, applied in the case of Texas.  The Congress to whom President Jackson referred the question as  one \"probably leading to war,\" and therefore a proper subject for  \"a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be  declared and by whom all the provisions for sustaining its perils must  be furnished,\" left the matter of the recognition of Texas to the  discretion of the Executive, providing merely for the sending of a  diplomatic agent when the President should be satisfied that the  Republic of Texas had become \"an independent state.\" It was so  recognized by President Van Buren, who commissioned a charge d'affaires  March 7, 1837, after Mexico had abandoned an attempt to reconquer the  Texan territory, and when there was at the time no _bona fide_  contest going on between the insurgent province and its former  sovereign.    I said in my message of December last:      It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection    possesses beyond dispute the attributes of statehood, which alone    can demand the recognition of belligerency in its favor.      The same requirement must certainly be no less seriously considered  when the graver issue of recognizing independence is in question, for  no less positive test can be applied to the greater act than to the  lesser, while, on the other hand, the influences and consequences of the  struggle upon the internal policy of the recognizing state, which form  important factors when the recognition of belligerency is concerned, are  secondary, if not rightly eliminable, factors when the real question is  whether the community claiming recognition is or is not independent  beyond peradventure.    Nor from the standpoint of expediency do I think it would be wise  or prudent for this Government to recognize at the present time the  independence of the so-called Cuban Republic. Such recognition is not  necessary in order to enable the United States to intervene and pacify  the island. To commit this country now to the recognition of any  particular government in Cuba might subject us to embarrassing  conditions of international obligation toward the organization so  recognized. In case of intervention our conduct would be subject to the  approval or disapproval of such government. We would be required to  submit to its direction and to assume to it the mere relation of a  friendly ally.    When it shall appear hereafter that there is within the island a  government capable of performing the duties and discharging the  functions of a separate nation, and having as a matter of fact the  proper forms and attributes of nationality, such government can be  promptly and readily recognized and the relations and interests of the  United States with such nation adjusted.    There remain the alternative forms of intervention to end the war,  either as an impartial neutral, by imposing a rational compromise  between the contestants, or as the active ally of the one party or the  other.    As to the first, it is not to be forgotten that during the last few  months the relation of the United States has virtually been one of  friendly intervention in many ways, each not of itself conclusive, but  all tending to the exertion of a potential influence toward an ultimate  pacific result, just and honorable to all interests concerned. The  spirit of all our acts hitherto has been an earnest,"]]]
