[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#7)"],[1,"to Heliopolis?\"    The bird scrambled awkwardly on to the dressing-table.    \"Well, old man, how about it?\"    \"Steer a straight course for hell, old dear,\" came the muffled reply,  as the bird twisted its head under its wing, then untucked it to murmur  sleepily: \"T'hell!\"    So she made up her mind to move on the very day after the girl's  birthday, which fell in a fortnights time.  She would, indeed, have  left at once if it had not been that she had issued invitations on a  gigantic scale for a fancy-dress ball in honour of the anniversary.    Inwardly Damaris rebelled at the suggestion of moving on to Heliopolis;  outwardly she acquiesced without enthusiasm.    \"But if it will do that nasty little cough good, dearest, why wait for  the ball?\"    \"Do you want to go, Maris?\"    \"The desert will be so near,\" evaded the girl.  \"Half-an-hour's ride at  the most, so--so Ben Kelham told me, and there you see the desert,  miles upon miles of it stretching right away like the sea.\"    The hawk-eyes flashed across the girl's face, taking in the forced  indifference of the expression and the light which gleamed far down in  the eyes.    \"I had a letter from Ben this morning.  His lung has been troubling  him; that is why he hasn't been over.\"    \"Did you--has it--is it--?\" rather lamely replied the girl.    He had written Damaris a perfunctory note of welcome to the Land of the  Pharaohs; then, a week later, had come over to dine.  He had ached to  take his beautiful little chum up in his arms and shake her for her  haughtiness and by sheer strength of arms and will force her to say  \"yes\" to the question which it took him all his strength not to ask.    Since childhood he had been her slave, her door-mat, and the butt of  her various moods, feeling infinitely well rewarded by a careless smile  or word; so that he found it difficult, in fact well-nigh impossible,  to act up to her grace's plans and suddenly transpose himself into the  strong, silent man.    The girl, spoilt and accustomed to slavish devotion and used to his  worship, felt incensed, then hurt, and finally perplexed, and, to hide  it all, retired therewith into a shell of icy reserve.    He had adored her openly, and now, seemingly, looked upon her as just  one of the crowd of women in the hotel; she had taken his adoration for  granted and as a right, to waken one morning to find the gem she had  tossed in amongst the rubbish of her little experiences, gone!    Is there a greater mistake in the world than that of looking upon love  as an ordinary possession, instead of as a rare jewel?    They were both very young, so that they suffered the agonies of doubt  and uncertainty, whilst the worldly-wise old dame smiled up her sleeve.    From the hour of the early cup of tea until breakfast-time on the  morning of the ball, which was also the girl's birthday morning,  tarbusched, impudent young monkeys of messenger boys, bearing gifts and  flowers, arrived in a stream at the hotel.    Flowers in pots and vases and bunches lay everywhere in the suite;  shawls of many colours, silken veils, slippers, albums of views of  Egypt, rare antiques (made mostly in Birmingham), one mummied cat  (genuine), scarabs (suspicious), and one live gazelle littered the  place.    Ben Kelham had bought her a finger-napkin ring of dull gold; through it  he had forced some flowers, and sent it along.    She held it tight in her hand for a moment, then deliberately and  ostentatiously laid it amongst the clutter on the table, whilst her  grace peeped from behind the newspaper which she was reading in bed.    Arrived at the table in the breakfast-room, the girl suddenly flushed  pink and then went quite white.    Right in the centre, flanked on one side by the glass dish of glowing  fruit and the other by a cut-glass jar of Keiller's marmalade, stood a  cage tied at the top with silver ribbon and containing two cooing doves.    The doves were just ordinary ones, but their prison was no ordinary  cage.  Fair-sized and square, it was made of fine white bars of ivory.  The underside was also ivory, square and unblemished, and would have  made an ideal hairpin-tray; it stood upon ebony feet inlaid with  infinitesimal precious stones.    \"It has but just arrived, Miss Hethencourt,\" said the maitre d'hotel,  who had been fluttering around upon the tiptoe of a most unusual  curiosity.  \"There is no name, no message.\"    \"Please send it to my room,\" she replied indifferently, whilst, for  some unaccountable reason, her heart throbbed as she responded to the  birthday greetings which came from every corner of the room.          CHAPTER VI      \"_A mother is a mother still,    The holiest thing alive_.\"              COLERIDGE.      \"May the blessing of Allah who is God be upon thee, O woman!\"    The sonorous words, of the benediction rang through the room as Hugh  Carden Ali stood with the silken curtain drawn back in one hand and the  right raised in blessing upon his mother, who stood with arms  outstretched in the centre of the room.    Then he knelt to receive the benison of the woman he loved, smiled when  he felt the small hands upon his head and, leaping to his feet, swung  her up into his arms, covering her face with kisses.    \"You beautiful darling!\" he said, as he crushed her up, to the  derangement of her perfumed silks and satins and many jewels.  \"It's  just heavenly coming back to you, you dear, understanding mother.\"    The woman's heart leapt to battle, for in the last words, in the way  her beloved son looked down upon her in the tone of his voice, she knew  that, somewhere out in the world, he had received a hurt.  She knew so  little of him, had only had him for such a little, little while under  the influence of her love and in the shelter of her heart, and she  loved him, her firstborn, with a love beyond words.  Thinking to do the  best for him, and making the biggest mistake of all, beating down her  beloved husband's opposition, she had sent the boy to England, and in  the subsequent eight years had only seen him twice.    \"He is of the East, Woman of my Heart!  Behold, I have studied him,\"  had said the Sheikh, all those years ago.  \"Let him be, else evil may  befall him.\"    But Jill, his beautiful wife, had insisted, and his love for her being  beyond telling, the great Arab had submitted to her wish.    For so it had been written.    And what can be the outcome of the tragic mixing of blood?  Nothing but  pain.    \"Come to the roof and talk, Mother, under the stars.\"    So up the marble staircase, with his arm about her waist, to the roof  they went, where the silken awnings lay folded and the scented white  flowers hung asleep.    They stood under the canopy of purple night studded with flashing,  silvery points, as the soft winds carried to them the notes of a guitar  softly thrummed in the shade of the palms.    \"It is Mary, dear,\" happily whispered the woman.  \"She came with me to  welcome you.\"  And then she clasped her hands at the blaze of anger  which swept the man's face.    \"Most gracious Mother, I am master of my house, and, save for your  ever-esteemed, ever-desired presence, I cannot have woman set foot in  it without my consent.  When I have the desire for one as wife,  plaything or servant, then I will give orders.\"    \"But, Hugh, Mary is your sister!\"    \"Mary is my sister, and I do not deem it wise or seemly that she should  run about the country at her own wish or whim.\"    \"But, Hugh,------\"    \"Dear, let me speak.  I saw so much of woman in Europe that the  yashmak, the barku, the seclusion and modesty of the East have become  dear to me above all else.  Have you forgotten, dear, the restaurants,  the theatres, the parks and, Allah! the streets?  The half-stripped  bodies, the craving for excitement, the wine, the nights turned into  day!  Why, one has but to stretch the hand, for flowers to be laid  therein; the feet trip at every step with the trap of woman's hair; the  quarry stands waiting for the arrow; there is not even the incentive of  the chase, the hot pursuit, the lust of the kill.  I speak as my  father's son, and in my house I will have privacy and seclusion and  seemliness.  Women shall be brought to me when I desire their  presence.\"  And the steeliness of the voice brought the woman  up-sitting as he gave her an order cloaked in the guise of a favour  begged.  \"And I shall be glad if you will ask my sister to keep within  the women's quarters until I send for her.\"    \"But----\"    And she ripped the corner of her veil between perturbed fingers when,  upon the clapping of hands, a slave ran swiftly to learn his master's  pleasure, then hastened away to find the head body-woman of the  guesthouse assigned to women-visitors.    After which the sweet thrumming of the guitar instantly stopped.    On more than one night they talked under the stars, sitting on satin  cushions, or leaning on the marble fret-work of the balustrade looking  due east to where, so many miles away, flows the blue-green Nile, as it  has flowed through the centuries, all unheeding of the passing of  mighty kingdoms.    And yet had the mother learned nothing of the hurt reflected in her  firstborn's eyes.    \"Most precious Mother,\" he was saying, as he stood flicking the pages  of the latest illustrated paper just arrived from Cairo, but which was  really a volume of the Book of Life written, printed and published by  Fate.  \"If it pleases you to stay when I am gone, will you do so just  as long as you find happiness in my dwelling?\"    \"You are going, Hugh,--so soon--for long?\"    \"There has come a report of lion in the Nubian Desert, as far north as  Deir el-Bahari.  I can hardly believe it, for it is years and years  since a lion has been seen even in the Khor Baraka.  However, a runner  from Nubia came in this morning, so there may be something in it.

The Kahal of Vilna declared that the repressive policy, pursued during  the last few years by the \"Jewish Committee,\" had thrown a large part of  the Jewish people \"into utmost disorder,\" and had made the Jews \"shiver  and shudder at the thought that a general Jewish statute had been  drafted by the same Committee and had now been submitted to the Council  of State for revision.\" The petitioners go on to say that, weighed down  by a succession of cruel discriminations affecting not only their rights  but also their mode of discharging military service, the Jews would  succumb to utter despair, did they not repose their hopes in the  benevolence of the Tzar, who, on his recent trip through the Western  provinces, had expressed to the deputies of the Jewish communes his  imperial satisfaction with the loyalty to the throne displayed by the  Jews during the Polish insurrection of 1831. The Kahal of Vilna,  therefore, implored the Council of State \"to turn its attention to this  unfortunate and maligned people\" and to stop all further persecutions.    A more emphatic note of protest is sounded in the memorandum of Feigin.  By a string of references to the latest Government measures he  demonstrates the fact that \"the Jewish people is hunted down, not  because of its moral qualities but because of its faith.\"      The Jews, faced by the new statute, have lost all hope for a better lot,    inasmuch as the Government has embarked upon this measure without having    solicited the explanations or justifications of this people, whereas,    according to common legal procedure, even an individual may not be    condemned without having been called upon to justify himself.    The rebuke had no effect. The Government preferred to render its verdict  _in absentia_, without listening to counsel for the defence and without  any safeguards of fair play. In line with this attitude, it also denied  the petition of the Vilna Kahal to be allowed \"to send at least four  deputies to the capital as spokesmen of the entire Jewish people for the  purpose of submitting to the Government their explanations and  propositions concerning the reorganization of the Jews, after having  been presented with a draft of the statute.\" The final verdict was  pronounced in the spring of 1835, and in April the new \"Statute  concerning the Jews\" received the signature of the Tzar.    This \"Charter of Disabilities,\" which was destined to operate for many  decades, represents a combination of the Russian \"ground laws\"  concerning the Jews and the restrictive by-laws issued after 1804. The  Pale of Settlement was now accurately defined: it consisted of Lithuania  [1] and the South-western provinces, [2] without any territorial  restrictions, White Russia [3] minus the Villages, Little Russia [4]  minus the crown hamlets, New Russia [5] minus Nicholayev and Sevastopol,  the government of Kiev minus the city of Kiev, the Baltic provinces for  the old settlers only, while the rural settlements on the entire  fifty-verst zone along the Western frontier were to be closed to  newcomers. As for the interior provinces, only temporary \"furloughs\"  (limited to six weeks and to be certified by gubernatorial passports)  were to be granted for the execution of judicial and commercial affairs,  with the proviso that the travellers should wear Russian instead of  Jewish dress. The merchants affiliated with the first and second guilds  were allowed, in addition, to visit the two capitals, [6] the sea-ports,  as well as the fairs of Nizhni-Novgorod, Kharkov, and other big fairs  for wholesale buying or selling. [7]    [Footnote 1: The present governments of Kovno, Vilna, Grodno, and Minsk.]    [Footnote 2: The governments of Volhynia and Podolia.]    [Footnote 3: The governments of Vitebsk and Moghilev.]    [Footnote 4: The governments of Chernigov and Poltava.]    [Footnote 5: The governments of Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Tavrida, and  Bessarabia.]    [Footnote 6: St. Petersburg and Moscow.]    [Footnote 7: The time-limit was six months for the merchants of the  first guild and three months for those of the second.]    The Jews were further forbidden to employ Christian domestics for  permanent employment. They could hire Christians for occasional services  only, on condition that the latter live in separate quarters. Marriages  at an earlier age than eighteen for the bridegroom and sixteen for the  bride were forbidden under the pain of imprisonment--a prohibition which  the defective registration of births and marriages then in vogue made it  easy to evade. The language to be employed by the Jews in their public  documents was to be Russian or any other local dialect, but \"under no  circumstances the Hebrew language.\"    The function of the Kahal, according to the Statute, is to see to it  that the \"instructions of the authorities\" are carried out precisely and  that the state taxes and communal assessments are \"correctly remitted.\"  The Kahal elders are to be elected by the community every three years  from among persons who can read and write Russian, subject to their  being ratified by the gubernatorial administration. At the same time the  Jews are entitled to participation in the municipal elections; those who  can read and write Russian are eligible as members of the town councils  and magistracies--the supplementary law of 1836 fixed the rate at  one-third, [1] excepting the city of Vilna where the Jews were entirely  excluded from municipal self-government.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 368.]    Synagogues may not be built in the vicinity of churches. The Russian  schools of all grades are to be open to Jewish children, who \"are not  compelled to change their religion\" (Clause 106)--a welcome provision in  view of the compulsory methods which had then become habitual. The  coercive baptism of Jewish children was provided for in a separate  enactment, the Statute on Conscription, which is declared \"to remain in  force.\" In this way the Statute of 1835 reduces itself to a codification  of the whole mass of the preceding anti-Jewish legislation. Its only  positive feature was that it put a stop to the expulsion from the  villages which had ruined the Jewish population during the years  1804-1830.      6. THE RUSSIAN CENSORSHIP AND CONVERSIONIST ENDEAVORS    With all its discriminations, the promulgation of this general statute  was far from checking the feverish activity of the Government. With  indefatigable zeal, its hands went on turning the legislative wheel and  squeezing ever tighter the already unbearable vise of Jewish life. The  slightest attempt to escape from its pressure was punished ruthlessly.  In 1838 the police of St. Petersburg discovered a group of Jews in the  capital \"with expired passports,\" these Jews having extended their stay  there a little beyond the term fixed for Jewish travellers, and the Tzar  curtly decreed: \"to be sent to serve in the penal companies of  Kronstadt.\" [1] In 1840 heavy fines were imposed upon the landed  proprietors in the Great Russian governments for \"keeping over\" Jews on  their estates.    [Footnote 1: A fortress in the vicinity of St Petersburg.]    Considerable attention was bestowed by the Government on placing the  spiritual life of the Jews under police supervision. In 1836 a  censorship campaign was launched against Hebrew literature. Hebrew  books, which were then almost exclusively of a religious nature, such as  prayer-books, Bible and Talmud editions, rabbinic, cabalistic, and  hasidic writings, were then issuing from the printing presses of Vilna,  Slavuta, [1] and other places, and were subject to a rigorous censorship  exercised by Christians or by Jewish converts. Practically every Jewish  home-library consisted of religious works of this type. The suspicions  of the Government were aroused by certain Jewish converts who had  insinuated that the foreign editions of these works and those that had  appeared in Russia itself prior to the establishment of a censorship  were of an \"injurious\" character. As a result, all Jewish home-libraries  were subjected to a search. Orders were given to deliver into the hands  of the local police, in the course of that year, all foreign Hebrew  prints as well as the uncensored editions, published at any previous  time in Russia, and to entrust their revision to \"dependable\" rabbis.  These rabbis were instructed to put their stamp on the books approved by  them and return the books not approved by them to the police for  transmission to the Ministry of the Interior. The regulation involved  the entire ancient Hebrew literature printed during the sixteenth,  seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, prior to the establishment of the  Russian censorship. In order to \"facilitate the supervision\" over new  publications or reprints from older editions, all Jewish printing  presses which existed at that time in various cities and towns were  ordered closed, and only those of Vilna and Kiev, [2] to which special  censors were attached, were allowed to remain.    [Footnote 1: A town in Volhynia.]    [Footnote 2: The printing-press of Kiev was subsequently transferred to  Zhitomir.]    As the Hebrew authors of antiquity or the Middle Ages did not fully  anticipate the requirements of the Russian censors, many classic works  were found to contain passages which were thought to be \"at variance  with imperial enactments.\" By the ukase of 1836 all books of this kind,  circulating in tens of thousands of copies, had to be transported to St.  Petersburg under a police escort to await their final verdict. The  procedure, however, proved too cumbersome, and, in 1837, the emperor,  complying with the petitions of the governors, was graciously pleased to  command that all these"]]]
