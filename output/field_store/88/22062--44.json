Cart-loads of interesting documents, bound and  unbound, have been sold at various times as waste-paper,[1] when modern  red-tape thought them but rubbish. Some of them have been rescued and  resold at high prices, but some have been lost for ever.      [1] Nell Gwyn's private Housekeeping Book was among them, containing  most curious particulars of what was necessary in the time of Charles I  for a princely household. Fortunately it was among the rescued, and is  now in a private library.      In 1854 a very interesting series of blue books was commenced by the  authorities of the Patent Office, of course paid for out of the national  purse. Beginning with the year 1617 the particulars of every important  patent were printed from the original specifications and fac-simile  drawings made, where necessary, for the elucidation of the text. A  very moderate price was charged for each, only indeed the prime cost  of production. The general public, of course, cared little for such  literature, but those interested in the origin and progress of any  particular art, cared much, and many sets of Patents were purchased by  those engaged in research. But the great bulk of the stock was, to some  extent, inconvenient, and so when a removal to other offices, in 1879,  became necessary, the question arose as to what could be done with them.  These blue-books, which had cost the nation many thousands of pounds,  were positively sold to the paper mills as wastepaper, and nearly 100  tons weight were carted away at about L3 per ton. It is difficult to  believe, although positively true, that so great an act of vandalism  could have been perpetrated, even in a Government office. It is true  that no demand existed for some of them, but it is equally true that  in numerous cases, especially in the early specifications of the  steam engine and printing machine, the want of them has caused great  disappointment. To add a climax to the story, many of the \"pulped\"  specifications have had to be reprinted more than once since their  destruction.        CHAPTER VI. THE BOOKWORM.          THERE is a sort of busy worm        That will the fairest books deform,            By gnawing holes throughout them;        Alike, through every leaf they go,        Yet of its merits naught they know,            Nor care they aught about them.          Their tasteless tooth will tear and taint        The Poet, Patriot, Sage or Saint,            Not sparing wit nor learning.        Now, if you'd know the reason why,        The best of reasons I'll supply;            'Tis bread to the poor vermin.          Of pepper, snuff, or 'bacca smoke,        And Russia-calf they make a joke.            Yet, why should sons of science        These puny rankling reptiles dread?        'Tis but to let their books be read,            And bid the worms defiance.\"                                J. DORASTON.    A most destructive Enemy of books has been the bookworm. I say \"has  been,\" because, fortunately, his ravages in all civilised countries have  been greatly restricted during the last fifty years. This is due partly  to the increased reverence for antiquity which has been universally  developed--more still to the feeling of cupidity, which has caused  all owners to take care of volumes which year by year have become more  valuable--and, to some considerable extent, to the falling off in the  production of edible books.    The monks, who were the chief makers as well as the custodians of books,  through the long ages we call \"dark,\" because so little is known of  them, had no fear of the bookworm before their eyes, for, ravenous as  he is and was, he loves not parchment, and at that time paper was not.  Whether at a still earlier period he attacked the papyrus, the paper of  the Egyptians, I know not--probably he did, as it was a purely vegetable  substance; and if so, it is quite possible that the worm of to-day, in  such evil repute with us, is the lineal descendant of ravenous ancestors  who plagued the sacred Priests of On in the time of Joseph's Pharaoh, by  destroying their title deeds and their books of Science.    Rare things and precious, as manuscripts were before the invention of  typography, are well preserved, but when the printing press was invented  and paper books were multiplied in the earth; when libraries increased  and readers were many, then familiarity bred contempt; books were packed  in out-of-the-way places and neglected, and the oft-quoted, though  seldom seen, bookworm became an acknowledged tenant of the library, and  the mortal enemy of the bibliophile.    Anathemas have been hurled against this pest in nearly every European  language, old and new, and classical scholars of bye-gone centuries have  thrown their spondees and dactyls at him. Pierre Petit, in 1683, devoted  a long Latin poem to his dis-praise, and Parnell's charming Ode is well  known. Hear the poet lament:--     \"Pene tu mihi passerem Catulli,   Pene tu mihi Lesbiam abstulisti.\"    and then--     \"Quid dicam innumeros bene eruditos   Quorum tu monumenta tu labores       Isti pessimo ventre devorasti?\"    while Petit, who was evidently moved by strong personal feelings against  the \"invisum pecus,\" as he calls him, addresses his little enemy as  \"Bestia audax\" and \"Pestis chartarum.\"    But, as a portrait commonly precedes a biography, the curious reader  may wish to be told what this \"Bestia audax,\" who so greatly ruffles  the tempers of our eclectics, is like. Here, at starting, is a serious  chameleon-like difficulty, for the bookworm offers to us, if we are  guided by their words, as many varieties of size and shape as there are  beholders.    Sylvester, in his \"Laws of Verse,\" with more words than wit, described  him as \"a microscopic creature wriggling on the learned page, which,  when discovered, stiffens out into the resemblance of a streak of dirt.\"    The earliest notice is in \"Micrographia,\" by R. Hooke, folio, London,  1665. This work, which was printed at the expense of the Royal Society  of London, is an account of innumerable things examined by the author  under the microscope, and is most interesting for the frequent accuracy  of the author's observations, and most amusing for his equally frequent  blunders.    In his account of the bookworm, his remarks, which are rather long  and very minute, are absurdly blundering. He calls it \"a small white  Silver-shining Worm or Moth, which I found much conversant among books  and papers, and is supposed to be that which corrodes and eats holes  thro' the leaves and covers. Its head appears bigg and blunt, and its  body tapers from it towards the tail, smaller and smaller, being  shap'd almost like a carret.... It has two long horns before, which are  streight, and tapering towards the top, curiously ring'd or knobb'd and  brisled much like the marsh weed called Horses tail.... The hinder part  is terminated with three tails, in every particular resembling the two  longer horns that grow out of the head. The legs are scal'd and hair'd.  This animal probably feeds upon the paper and covers of books, and  perforates in them several small round holes, finding perhaps a  convenient nourishment in those husks of hemp and flax, which have  passed through so many scourings, washings, dressings, and dryings as  the parts of old paper necessarily have suffer'd. And, indeed, when I  consider what a heap of sawdust or chips this little creature (which is  one of the teeth of Time) conveys into its intrals, I cannot chuse but  remember and admire the excellent contrivance of Nature in placing in  animals such a fire, as is continually nourished and supply'd by the  materials convey'd into the stomach and fomented by the bellows of the  lungs.\" The picture or \"image,\" which accompanies this description, is  wonderful to behold. Certainly R. Hooke, Fellow of the Royal Society,  drew somewhat upon his imagination here, having apparently evolved both  engraving and description from his inner consciousness.[1]      [1] Not so! Several correspondents have drawn my attention to the  fact that Hooke is evidently describing the \"Lepisma,\" which, if not  positively injurious, is often found in the warm places of old houses,  especially if a little damp. He mistook this for the Bookworm.      Entomologists even do not appear to have paid much attention to the  natural history of the \"Worm.\" Kirby, speaking of it, says, \"the  larvae of Crambus pinguinalis spins a robe which it covers with its own  excrement, and does no little injury.\" Again, \"I have often observed the  caterpillar of a little moth that takes its station in damp old books,  and there commits great ravages, and many a black-letter rarity, which  in these days of bibliomania would have been valued at its weight in  gold, has been snatched by these devastators,\" etc., etc.    As already quoted, Doraston's description is very vague. To him he is  in one verse \"a sort of busy worm,\" and in another \"a puny rankling  reptile.\" Hannett, in his work on book-binding, gives \"Aglossa  pinguinalis\" as the real name, and Mrs. Gatty, in her Parables,  christens it \"Hypothenemus cruditus.\"    The, Rev. F. T. Havergal, who many years ago had much trouble with  bookworms in the Cathedral Library of Hereford, says they are a kind of  death-watch, with a \"hard outer skin, and are dark brown,\" another sort  \"having white bodies with brown spots on their heads.\" Mr. Holme, in  \"Notes and Queries\" for 1870, states that the \"Anobium paniceum\" has  done considerable injury to the Arabic manuscripts brought from Cairo,  by Burckhardt, and now in the University Library, Cambridge. Other  writers say \"Acarus eruditus\" or \"Anobium pertinax\" are the correct  scientific names.    Personally, I have come across but few specimens; nevertheless, from  what I have been told by librarians, and judging from analogy, I imagine  the following to be about the truth:--    There"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13029"],[0,"The Art of the Moving Picture (#7)"],[1,"implied purpose of the mass of books on the  photoplay subject. They are, indeed, a sickening array. Freeburg's book  is one of the noble exceptions. And I have paid tribute elsewhere to John  Emerson and Anita Loos. They have written a crusading book, and many  crusading articles.    After five years of exceedingly lonely art study, in which I had always  specialized in museum exhibits, prowling around like a lost dog, I began  to intensify my museum study, and at the same time shout about what I was  discovering. From nineteen hundred and five on I did orate my opinions to  a group of advanced students. We assembled weekly for several winters in  the Metropolitan Museum, New York, for the discussion of the  masterpieces in historic order, from Egypt to America. From that  standpoint, the work least often found, hardest to make, least popular in  the street, may be in the end the one most treasured in a world-museum as  a counsellor and stimulus of mankind. Throughout this book I try to bring  to bear the same simple standards of form, composition, mood, and motive  that we used in finding the fundamental exhibits; the standards which are  taken for granted in art histories and schools, radical or conservative,  anywhere.    Again we assume it is eight o'clock in the evening, friend reader, when  the chapter begins.    Just as the Action Picture has its photographic basis or fundamental  metaphor in the long chase down the highway, so the Intimate Film has its  photographic basis in the fact that any photoplay interior has a very  small ground plan, and the cosiest of enclosing walls. Many a worth-while  scene is acted out in a space no bigger than that which is occupied by an  office boy's stool and hat. If there is a table in this room, it is often  so near it is half out of the picture or perhaps it is against the front  line of the triangular ground-plan. Only the top of the table is seen,  and nothing close up to us is pictured below that. We in the audience are  privileged characters. Generally attending the show in bunches of two or  three, we are members of the household on the screen. Sometimes we are  sitting on the near side of the family board. Or we are gossiping  whispering neighbors, of the shoemaker, we will say, with our noses  pressed against the pane of a metaphoric window.    Take for contrast the old-fashioned stage production showing the room and  work table of a shoemaker. As it were the whole side of the house has  been removed. The shop is as big as a banquet hall. There is something  essentially false in what we see, no matter how the stage manager fills  in with old boxes, broken chairs, and the like. But the photoplay  interior is the size such a work-room should be. And there the awl and  pegs and bits of leather, speaking the silent language of picture  writing, can be clearly shown. They are sometimes like the engine in  chapter two, the principal actors.    Though the Intimate-and-friendly Photoplay may be carried out of doors to  the row of loafers in front of the country store, or the gossiping  streets of the village, it takes its origin and theory from the snugness  of the interior.    The restless reader replies that he has seen photoplays that showed  ballrooms that were grandiose, not the least cosy. These are to be  classed as out-of-door scenery so far as theory goes, and are to be  discussed under the head of Splendor Pictures. Masses of human beings  pour by like waves, the personalities of none made plain. The only  definite people are the hero and heroine in the foreground, and maybe one  other. Though these three be in ball-costume, the little triangle they  occupy next to the camera is in sort an interior, while the impersonal  guests behind them conform to the pageant principles of out-of-doors, and  the dancers are to the main actor as is the wind-shaken forest to the  charcoal-burner, or the bending grain to the reaper.    The Intimate Motion Picture is the world's new medium for studying, not  the great passions, such as black hate, transcendent love, devouring  ambition, but rather the half relaxed or gently restrained moods of human  creatures. It gives also our idiosyncrasies. It is gossip _in extremis_.  It is apt to chronicle our petty little skirmishes, rather than our  feuds. In it Colin Clout and his comrades return.    The Intimate Photoplay should not crowd its characters. It should not  choke itself trying to dramatize the whole big bloody plot of Lorna  Doone, or any other novel with a dozen leading people. Yet some gentle  episode from the John Ridd farm, some half-chapter when Lorna and the  Doones are almost forgotten, would be fitting. Let the duck-yard be  parading its best, and Annie among the milk-pails, her work for the  evening well nigh done. The Vicar of Wakefield has his place in this  form. The Intimate-and-friendly Motion Picture might very well give  humorous moments in the lives of the great, King Alfred burning the  cakes, and other legendary incidents of him. Plato's writings give us  glimpses of Socrates, in between the long dialogues. And there are  intimate scraps in Plutarch.    Prospective author-producer, do you remember Landor's Imaginary  Conversations, and Lang's Letters to Dead Authors? Can you not attain to  that informal understanding in pictorial delineations of such people?    The photoplay has been unjust to itself in comedies. The late John  Bunny's important place in my memory comes from the first picture in  which I saw him. It is a story of high life below stairs. The hero is the  butler at a governor's reception. John Bunny's work as this man is a  delightful piece of acting. The servants are growing tipsier downstairs,  but the more afraid of the chief functionary every time he appears,  frozen into sobriety by his glance. At the last moment this god of the  basement catches them at their worst and gives them a condescending but  forgiving smile. The lid comes off completely. He himself has been  imbibing. His surviving dignity in waiting on the governor's guests is  worthy of the stage of Goldsmith and Sheridan. This film should be  reissued in time as a Bunny memorial.    So far as my experience has gone, the best of the comedians is Sidney  Drew. He could shine in the atmosphere of Pride and Prejudice or  Cranford. But the best things I have seen of his are far from such. I beg  the pardon of Miss Jane Austen and Mrs. Gaskell while I mention Who's Who  in Hogg's Hollow, and A Regiment of Two. Over these I rejoiced like a  yokel with a pocketful of butterscotch and peanuts. The opportunities to  laugh on a higher plane than this, to laugh like Olympians, are seldom  given us in this world.    The most successful motion picture drama of the intimate type ever placed  before mine eyes was Enoch Arden, produced by Cabanne.    Lillian Gish takes the part of Annie, Alfred Paget impersonates Enoch  Arden, and Wallace Reid takes the part of Philip Ray. The play is in four  reels of twenty minutes each. It should have been made into three reels  by shortening every scene just a bit. Otherwise it is satisfying, and I  and my friends have watched it through many times as it has returned to  Springfield.    The mood of the original poem is approximated. The story is told with  fireside friendliness. The pale Lillian Gish surrounded by happy children  gives us many a genre painting on the theme of domesticity. It is a  photographic rendering in many ways as fastidious as Tennyson's  versification. The scenes on the desert island are some of them  commonplace. The shipwreck and the like remind one of other photoplays,  but the rest of the production has a mood of its own. Seen several months  ago it fills my eye-imagination and eye-memory more than that particular  piece of Tennyson's fills word-imagination and word-memory. Perhaps this  is because it is pleasing to me as a theorist. It is a sound example of  the type of film to which this chapter is devoted. If you cannot get your  local manager to bring Enoch Arden, reread that poem of Tennyson's and  translate it in your own mind's eye into a gallery of six hundred  delicately toned photographs hung in logical order, most of them cosy  interior scenes, some of the faces five feet from chin to forehead in the  more personal episodes, yet exquisitely fair. Fill in the out-of-door  scenes and general gatherings with the appointments of an idyllic English  fisher-village, and you will get an approximate conception of what we  mean by the Intimate-and-friendly Motion Picture, or the Intimate  Picture, as I generally call it, for convenience.    It is a quality, not a defect, of all photoplays that human beings tend  to become dolls and mechanisms, and dolls and mechanisms tend to become  human. But the haughty, who scorn the moving pictures, cannot rid  themselves of the feeling that they are being seduced into going into  some sort of a Punch-and-Judy show. And they think that of course one  should not take seriously anything so cheap in price and so appealing to  the cross-roads taste. But it is very well to begin in the  Punch-and-Judy-show state of mind, and reconcile ourselves to it, and  then like good democrats await discoveries. Punch and Judy is the  simplest form of marionette performance, and the marionette has a place  in every street in history just as the dolls' house has its corner in  every palace and cottage. The French in particular have had their great  periods of puppet shows; and the Italian tradition survived in America's  Little Italy, in New York for many a day; and I will mention in passing  that one of Pavlowa's unforgettable dance dramas is The Fairy Doll.  Prospective author-producer, why not spend a deal of energy on the  photoplay successors of the puppet-plays?    We have the queen of the marionettes already, without the play.    One description of the Intimate-and-friendly Comedy would be the Mary  Pickford kind of a story. None"]]]
