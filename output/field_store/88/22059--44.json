For we can hear scepticism crashing through the old ring of authorities,  and at the same moment we can see reason swaying upon her throne.  In so far as religion is gone, reason is going.  For they are both  of the same primary and authoritative kind.  They are both methods  of proof which cannot themselves be proved.  And in the act of  destroying the idea of Divine authority we have largely destroyed  the idea of that human authority by which we do a long-division sum.  With a long and sustained tug we have attempted to pull the mitre  off pontifical man; and his head has come off with it.         Lest this should be called loose assertion, it is perhaps  desirable, though dull, to run rapidly through the chief modern  fashions of thought which have this effect of stopping thought itself.  Materialism and the view of everything as a personal illusion have  some such effect; for if the mind is mechanical, thought cannot be  very exciting, and if the cosmos is unreal, there is nothing to think  about.  But in these cases the effect is indirect and doubtful.  In  some cases it is direct and clear; notably in the case of what is  generally called evolution.         Evolution is a good example of that modern intelligence which,  if it destroys anything, destroys itself.  Evolution is either  an innocent scientific description of how certain earthly things  came about; or, if it is anything more than this, it is an attack  upon thought itself.  If evolution destroys anything, it does not  destroy religion but rationalism.  If evolution simply means that  a positive thing called an ape turned very slowly into a positive  thing called a man, then it is stingless for the most orthodox;  for a personal God might just as well do things slowly as quickly,  especially if, like the Christian God, he were outside time.  But if it means anything more, it means that there is no such  thing as an ape to change, and no such thing as a man for him  to change into.  It means that there is no such thing as a thing.  At best, there is only one thing, and that is a flux of everything  and anything.  This is an attack not upon the faith, but upon  the mind; you cannot think if there are no things to think about.  You cannot think if you are not separate from the subject of thought.  Descartes said, \"I think; therefore I am.\"  The philosophic evolutionist  reverses and negatives the epigram.  He says, \"I am not; therefore I  cannot think.\"         Then there is the opposite attack on thought:  that urged by  Mr. H.G.Wells when he insists that every separate thing is \"unique,\"  and there are no categories at all.  This also is merely destructive.  Thinking means connecting things, and stops if they cannot be connected.  It need hardly be said that this scepticism forbidding thought  necessarily forbids speech; a man cannot open his mouth without  contradicting it.  Thus when Mr. Wells says (as he did somewhere),  \"All chairs are quite different,\" he utters not merely a misstatement,  but a contradiction in terms.  If all chairs were quite different,  you could not call them \"all chairs.\"         Akin to these is the false theory of progress, which maintains  that we alter the test instead of trying to pass the test.  We often hear it said, for instance, \"What is right in one age  is wrong in another.\"  This is quite reasonable, if it means that  there is a fixed aim, and that certain methods attain at certain  times and not at other times.  If women, say, desire to be elegant,  it may be that they are improved at one time by growing fatter and  at another time by growing thinner.  But you cannot say that they  are improved by ceasing to wish to be elegant and beginning to wish  to be oblong.  If the standard changes, how can there be improvement,  which implies a standard?  Nietzsche started a nonsensical idea that  men had once sought as good what we now call evil; if it were so,  we could not talk of surpassing or even falling short of them.  How can you overtake Jones if you walk in the other direction?  You cannot discuss whether one people has succeeded more in being  miserable than another succeeded in being happy.  It would be  like discussing whether Milton was more puritanical than a pig  is fat.         It is true that a man (a silly man) might make change itself his  object or ideal.  But as an ideal, change itself becomes unchangeable.  If the change-worshipper wishes to estimate his own progress, he must  be sternly loyal to the ideal of change; he must not begin to flirt  gaily with the ideal of monotony.  Progress itself cannot progress.  It is worth remark, in passing, that when Tennyson, in a wild and rather  weak manner, welcomed the idea of infinite alteration in society,  he instinctively took a metaphor which suggests an imprisoned tedium.  He wrote--         \"Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves  of change.\"    He thought of change itself as an unchangeable groove; and so it is.  Change is about the narrowest and hardest groove that a man can  get into.         The main point here, however, is that this idea of a fundamental  alteration in the standard is one of the things that make thought  about the past or future simply impossible.  The theory of a  complete change of standards in human history does not merely  deprive us of the pleasure of honouring our fathers; it deprives  us even of the more modern and aristocratic pleasure of despising them.         This bald summary of the thought-destroying forces of our  time would not be complete without some reference to pragmatism;  for though I have here used and should everywhere defend the  pragmatist method as a preliminary guide to truth, there is an extreme  application of it which involves the absence of all truth whatever.  My meaning can be put shortly thus.  I agree with the pragmatists  that apparent objective truth is not the whole matter; that there  is an authoritative need to believe the things that are necessary  to the human mind.  But I say that one of those necessities  precisely is a belief in objective truth.  The pragmatist tells  a man to think what he must think and never mind the Absolute.  But precisely one of the things that he must think is the Absolute.  This philosophy, indeed, is a kind of verbal paradox.  Pragmatism is  a matter of human needs; and one of the first of human needs  is to be something more than a pragmatist.  Extreme pragmatism  is just as inhuman as the determinism it so powerfully attacks.  The determinist (who, to do him justice, does not pretend to be  a human being) makes nonsense of the human sense of actual choice.  The pragmatist, who professes to be specially human, makes nonsense  of the human sense of actual fact.         To sum up our contention so far, we may say that the most  characteristic current philosophies have not only a touch of mania,  but a touch of suicidal mania.  The mere questioner has knocked  his head against the limits of human thought; and cracked it.  This is what makes so futile the warnings of the orthodox and the  boasts of the advanced about the dangerous boyhood of free thought.  What we are looking at is not the boyhood of free thought; it is  the old age and ultimate dissolution of free thought.  It is vain  for bishops and pious bigwigs to discuss what dreadful things will  happen if wild scepticism runs its course.  It has run its course.  It is vain for eloquent atheists to talk of the great truths that  will be revealed if once we see free thought begin.  We have seen  it end.  It has no more questions to ask; it has questioned itself.  You cannot call up any wilder vision than a city in which men  ask themselves if they have any selves.  You cannot fancy a more  sceptical world than that in which men doubt if there is a world.  It might certainly have reached its bankruptcy more quickly  and cleanly if it had not been feebly hampered by the application  of indefensible laws of blasphemy or by the absurd pretence  that modern England is Christian.  But it would have reached the  bankruptcy anyhow.  Militant atheists are still unjustly persecuted;  but rather because they are an old minority than because they  are a new one.  Free thought has exhausted its own freedom.  It is weary of its own success.  If any eager freethinker now hails  philosophic freedom as the dawn, he is only like the man in Mark  Twain who came out wrapped in blankets to see the sun rise and was  just in time to see it set.  If any frightened curate still says  that it will be awful if the darkness of free thought should spread,  we can only answer him in the high and powerful words of Mr. Belloc,  \"Do not, I beseech you, be troubled about the increase of forces  already in dissolution.  You have mistaken the hour of the night:  it is already morning.\"  We have no more questions left to ask.  We have looked for questions in the darkest corners and on the  wildest peaks.  We have found all the questions that can be found.  It is time we gave up looking for questions and began looking  for answers.         But one more word must be added.  At the beginning of this  preliminary negative sketch I said that our mental ruin has  been wrought by wild reason, not by wild imagination.  A man  does not go mad because he makes a statue a mile high, but he  may go mad by thinking it out in square inches.  Now, one school  of thinkers has seen this and jumped at it as a way of renewing  the pagan health of the world.  They see that reason destroys;  but Will, they say, creates.  The ultimate authority, they say,  is in will, not in reason.  The supreme point is not why  a man demands a thing, but the fact that he does demand it.  I have no space to trace or expound this philosophy of Will.  It came, I suppose, through Nietzsche, who preached something  that is called egoism.  That, indeed, was simpleminded enough;  for Nietzsche denied egoism simply by preaching"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#7)"],[1,"in so late,\" replied  Venters, slowly, and his glance sought Lassiter's. \"Cattle are usually  quiet after dark. Still, I've known even a coyote to stampede your white  herd.\"    \"I refuse to borrow trouble. Come,\" said Jane.    They mounted, and, with Jane in the lead, rode down the lane, and,  turning off into a cattle trail, proceeded westward. Venters's dogs  trotted behind them. On this side of the ranch the outlook was different  from that on the other; the immediate foreground was rough and the sage  more rugged and less colorful; there were no dark-blue lines of canyons  to hold the eye, nor any uprearing rock walls. It was a long roll and  slope into gray obscurity. Soon Jane left the trail and rode into the  sage, and presently she dismounted and threw her bridle. The men did  likewise. Then, on foot, they followed her, coming out at length on the  rim of a low escarpment. She passed by several little ridges of earth to  halt before a faintly defined mound. It lay in the shade of a sweeping  sage-brush close to the edge of the promontory; and a rider could have  jumped his horse over it without recognizing a grave.    \"Here!\"    She looked sad as she spoke, but she offered no explanation for the  neglect of an unmarked, uncared-for grave. There was a little bunch of  pale, sweet lavender daisies, doubtless planted there by Jane.    \"I only come here to remember and to pray,\" she said. \"But I leave no  trail!\"    A grave in the sage! How lonely this resting-place of Milly Erne! The  cottonwoods or the alfalfa fields were not in sight, nor was there any  rock or ridge or cedar to lend contrast to the monotony. Gray slopes,  tinging the purple, barren and wild, with the wind waving the sage,  swept away to the dim horizon.    Lassiter looked at the grave and then out into space. At that moment he  seemed a figure of bronze.    Jane touched Venters's arm and led him back to the horses.    \"Bern!\" cried Jane, when they were out of hearing. \"Suppose Lassiter  were Milly's husband--the father of that little girl lost so long ago!\"    \"It might be, Jane. Let us ride on. If he wants to see us again he'll  come.\"    So they mounted and rode out to the cattle trail and began to climb.  From the height of the ridge, where they had started down, Venters  looked back. He did not see Lassiter, but his glance, drawn irresistibly  farther out on the gradual slope, caught sight of a moving cloud of  dust.    \"Hello, a rider!\"    \"Yes, I see,\" said Jane.    \"That fellow's riding hard. Jane, there's something wrong.\"    \"Oh yes, there must be.... How he rides!\"    The horse disappeared in the sage, and then puffs of dust marked his  course.    \"He's short-cut on us--he's making straight for the corrals.\"    Venters and Jane galloped their steeds and reined in at the turning of  the lane. This lane led down to the right of the grove. Suddenly into  its lower entrance flashed a bay horse. Then Venters caught the fast  rhythmic beat of pounding hoofs. Soon his keen eye recognized the swing  of the rider in his saddle.    \"It's Judkins, your Gentile rider!\" he cried. \"Jane, when Judkins rides  like that it means hell!\"        CHAPTER IV. DECEPTION PASS    The rider thundered up and almost threw his foam-flecked horse in the  sudden stop. He was a giant form, and with fearless eyes.    \"Judkins, you're all bloody!\" cried Jane, in affright. \"Oh, you've been  shot!\"    \"Nothin' much Miss Withersteen. I got a nick in the shoulder. I'm some  wet an' the hoss's been throwin' lather, so all this ain't blood.\"    \"What's up?\" queried Venters, sharply.    \"Rustlers sloped off with the red herd.\"    \"Where are my riders?\" demanded Jane.    \"Miss Withersteen, I was alone all night with the herd. At daylight this  mornin' the rustlers rode down. They began to shoot at me on sight. They  chased me hard an' far, burnin' powder all the time, but I got away.\"    \"Jud, they meant to kill you,\" declared Venters.    \"Now I wonder,\" returned Judkins. \"They wanted me bad. An' it ain't  regular for rustlers to waste time chasin' one rider.\"    \"Thank heaven you got away,\" said Jane. \"But my riders--where are they?\"    \"I don't know. The night-riders weren't there last night when I rode  down, en' this mornin' I met no day-riders.\"    \"Judkins! Bern, they've been set upon--killed by Oldring's men!\"    \"I don't think so,\" replied Venters, decidedly. \"Jane, your riders  haven't gone out in the sage.\"    \"Bern, what do you mean?\" Jane Withersteen turned deathly pale.    \"You remember what I said about the unseen hand?\"    \"Oh!... Impossible!\"    \"I hope so. But I fear--\" Venters finished, with a shake of his head.    \"Bern, you're bitter; but that's only natural. We'll wait to see what's  happened to my riders. Judkins, come to the house with me. Your wound  must be attended to.\"    \"Jane, I'll find out where Oldring drives the herd,\" vowed Venters.    \"No, no! Bern, don't risk it now--when the rustlers are in such shooting  mood.\"    \"I'm going. Jud, how many cattle in that red herd?\"    \"Twenty-five hundred head.\"    \"Whew! What on earth can Oldring do with so many cattle? Why, a hundred  head is a big steal. I've got to find out.\"    \"Don't go,\" implored Jane.    \"Bern, you want a hoss thet can run. Miss Withersteen, if it's not too  bold of me to advise, make him take a fast hoss or don't let him go.\"    \"Yes, yes, Judkins. He must ride a horse that can't be caught. Which  one--Black Star--Night?\"    \"Jane, I won't take either,\" said Venters, emphatically. \"I wouldn't  risk losing one of your favorites.\"    \"Wrangle, then?\"    \"Thet's the hoss,\" replied Judkins. \"Wrangle can outrun Black Star an'  Night. You'd never believe it, Miss Withersteen, but I know. Wrangle's  the biggest en' fastest hoss on the sage.\"    \"Oh no, Wrangle can't beat Black Star. But, Bern, take Wrangle if you  will go. Ask Jerd for anything you need. Oh, be watchful, careful.... God  speed you.\"    She clasped his hand, turned quickly away, and went down a lane with the  rider.    Venters rode to the barn, and, leaping off, shouted for Jerd. The boy  came running. Venters sent him for meat, bread, and dried fruits, to  be packed in saddlebags. His own horse he turned loose into the nearest  corral. Then he went for Wrangle. The giant sorrel had earned his name  for a trait the opposite of amiability. He came readily out of the barn,  but once in the yard he broke from Venters, and plunged about with ears  laid back. Venters had to rope him, and then he kicked down a section  of fence, stood on his hind legs, crashed down and fought the rope. Jerd  returned to lend a hand.    \"Wrangle don't git enough work,\" said Jerd, as the big saddle went on.  \"He's unruly when he's corralled, an' wants to run. Wait till he smells  the sage!\"    \"Jerd, this horse is an iron-jawed devil. I never straddled him but  once. Run? Say, he's swift as wind!\"    When Venters's boot touched the stirrup the sorrel bolted, giving him  the rider's flying mount. The swing of this fiery horse recalled to  Venters days that were not really long past, when he rode into the sage  as the leader of Jane Withersteen's riders. Wrangle pulled hard on a  tight rein. He galloped out of the lane, down the shady border of  the grove, and hauled up at the watering-trough, where he pranced and  champed his bit. Venters got off and filled his canteen while the horse  drank. The dogs, Ring and Whitie, came trotting up for their drink. Then  Venters remounted and turned Wrangle toward the sage.    A wide, white trail wound away down the slope. One keen, sweeping glance  told Venters that there was neither man nor horse nor steer within the  limit of his vision, unless they were lying down in the sage. Ring loped  in the lead and Whitie loped in the rear. Wrangle settled gradually into  an easy swinging canter, and Venters's thoughts, now that the rush and  flurry of the start were past, and the long miles stretched before him,  reverted to a calm reckoning of late singular coincidences.    There was the night ride of Tull's, which, viewed in the light of  subsequent events, had a look of his covert machinations; Oldring and  his Masked Rider and his rustlers riding muffled horses; the report  that Tull had ridden out that morning with his man Jerry on the trail  to Glaze, the strange disappearance of Jane Withersteen's riders,  the unusually determined attempt to kill the one Gentile still in her  employ, an intention frustrated, no doubt, only by Judkin's magnificent  riding of her racer, and lastly the driving of the red herd. These  events, to Venters's color of mind, had a dark relationship. Remembering  Jane's accusation of bitterness, he tried hard to put aside his rancor  in judging Tull. But it was bitter knowledge that made him see the  truth. He had felt the shadow of an unseen hand; he had watched till he  saw its dim outline, and then he had traced it to a man's hate, to  the rivalry of a Mormon Elder, to the power of a Bishop, to the long,  far-reaching arm of a terrible creed. That unseen hand had made its  first move against Jane Withersteen. Her riders had been called in,  leaving her without help to drive seven thousand head of cattle. But to  Venters it seemed extraordinary that the power which had called in these  riders had left so many cattle to be driven by rustlers and harried by  wolves. For hand in glove with that power was an insatiate greed; they  were one and the same.    \"What can Oldring do with twenty-five hundred head of cattle?\" muttered  Venters. \"Is he a Mormon? Did he meet Tull last night? It looks like  a black plot to me. But Tull and his churchmen wouldn't ruin Jane  Withersteen unless the Church was to profit by that ruin. Where does  Oldring come in? I'm going to find out about these things.\"    Wrangle did the twenty-five miles in three hours and walked little of  the way. When he had gotten warmed up he had been allowed to choose his  own gait. The afternoon had well"]]]
