It is natural you should take his part, but you have  no cause of complaint against your neighbors. He has been  arrested for the murder of John Smith, on his own confession.    MRS. FALLON. The saints of heaven protect us! And what did he  want killing Jack Smith?    MAGISTRATE. It is best you should know all. He did it on account  of a love-affair with the murdered man's wife.    MRS. FALLON (_sitting down_). With Jack Smith's wife! With Kitty  Keary!--Ochone, the traitor!    THE CROWD. A great shame, indeed. He is a traitor, indeed.    MRS. TULLY. To America he was bringing her, Mrs. Fallon.    BAETLEY. What are you saying, Mary? I tell you--    MRS. FALLON. Don't say a word! I won't listen to any word you'll  say! (_Stops her ears._) Oh, isn't he the treacherous villain?  Ohone go deo!    BARTLEY. Be quiet till I speak! Listen to what I say!    MRS. FALLON. Sitting beside me on the ass car coming to the town,  so quiet and so respectable, and treachery like that in his  heart!    BARTLEY. Is it your wits you have lost, or is it I myself that  have lost my wits?    MRS. FALLON. And it's hard I earned you, slaving, slaving--and  you grumbling, and sighing, and coughing, and discontented, and  the priest wore out anointing you, with all the times you  threatened to die!    BARTLEY. Let you be quiet till I tell you!    MRS. FALLON. You to bring such a disgrace into the parish. A  thing that was never heard of before!    BARTLEY. Will you shut your mouth and hear me speaking?    MRS. FALLON. And if it was for any sort of a fine handsome woman,  but for a little fistful of a woman like Kitty Keary, that's not  four feet high hardly, and not three teeth in her head unless she  got new ones! May God reward you, Bartley Fallon, for the black  treachery in your heart and the wickedness in your mind, and the  red blood of poor Jack Smith that is wet upon your hand!    (_Voice of JACK SMITH heard singing_)      The sea shall be dry,      The earth under mourning and ban!    Then loud shall he cry      For the wife of the red-haired man!    BARTLEY. It's Jack Smith's voice--I never knew a ghost to sing  before. It is after myself and the fork he is coming! (_Goes back.  Enter_ JACK SMITH.) Let one of you give him the fork and I will be  clear of him now and for eternity!    MRS. TARPEY. The Lord have mercy on us! Red Jack Smith! The man  that was going to be waked!    JAMES RYAN. Is it back from the grave you are come?    SHAWN EARLY. Is it alive you are, or is it dead you are?    TIM CASEY. Is it yourself at all that's in it?    MRS. TULLY. Is it letting on you were to be dead?    MRS. FALLON. Dead or alive, let you stop Kitty Keary, your wife,  from bringing my man away with her to America!    JACK SMITH. It is what I think, the wits are gone astray on the  whole of you. What would my wife want bringing Bartley Fallon to  America?    MRS. FALLON. To leave yourself, and to get quit of you she wants,  Jack Smith, and to bring him away from myself. That's what the  two of them had settled together.    JACK SMITH. I'll break the head of any man that says that! Who is  it says it? (_To_ TIM CASEY) Was it you said it? (_To_ SHAWN EARLY)  Was it you?    ALL TOGETHER (_backing and shaking their heads_). It wasn't I said  it!    JACK SMITH. Tell me the name of any man that said it!    ALL TOGETHEB (_pointing to_ BARTLEY). It was _him_ that said  it!    JACK SMITH. Let me at him till I break his head!    (BARTLEY _backs in terror. Neighbors hold_ JACK SMITH _back._)    JACK SMITH (_trying to free himself_). Let me at him! Isn't he the  pleasant sort of a scarecrow for any woman to be crossing the  ocean with! It's back from the docks of New York he'd be turned  (_trying to rush at him again_), with a lie in his mouth and  treachery in his heart, and another man's wife by his side, and  he passing her off as his own! Let me at him, can't you?    (_Makes another rush, but is held back._)    MAGISTRATE (_pointing to_ JACK SMITH). Policeman, put the handcuffs  on this man. I see it all now. A case of false impersonation, a  conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice. There was a case in the  Andaman Islands, a murderer of the Mopsa tribe, a religious  enthusiast--    POLICEMAN. So he might be, too.    MAGISTRATE. We must take both these men to the scene of the  murder. We must confront them with the body of the real Jack  Smith.    JACK SMITH. I'll break the head of any man that will find my dead  body!    MAGISTRATE. I'll call more help from the barracks.    (_Blows POLICEMAN'S whistle._)    BARTLEY. It is what I am thinking, if myself and Jack Smith are  put together in the one cell for the night, the handcuffs will be  taken off him, and his hands will be free, and murder will be  done that time surely!    MAGISTRATE. Come on!

The windows of the palace are open, and from a  distance there comes the sound of a man's voice crying for bread._  THE KING _sits in a golden chair. A golden crown is on his head,  and he holds in his hand a sceptre which is also of gold. A_  SERVANT _stands by his side, fanning him with an enormous fan of  peacock feathers._      THE BEGGAR (_outside_). Bread. Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.    THE KING (_languidly_). Who is that crying in the street for bread?    THE SERVANT (_fanning_). O king, it is a beggar.    THE KING. Why does he cry for bread?    THE SERVANT. O king, he cries for bread in order that he may fill  his belly.    THE KING. I do not like the sound of his voice. It annoys me very  much. Send him away.    THE SERVANT (_bowing_). O king, he _has_ been sent away.    THE KING. If that is so, then why do I hear his voice?    THE SERVANT. O king, he has been sent away many times, yet each  time that he is sent away he returns again, crying louder than he  did before.    THE KING. He is very unwise to annoy me on such a warm day. He  must be punished for his impudence. Use the lash on him.    THE SERVANT. O king, it has been done.    THE KING. Then bring out the spears.    THE SEBVANT. O king, the guards have already bloodied their  swords many times driving him away from the palace gates. But it  is of no avail.    THE KING. Then bind him and gag him if necessary. If need be cut  out his tongue. I do not like the sound of the fellow's voice. It  annoys me very much.    THE SERVANT. O king, thy orders were obeyed even yesterday.    THE KING (_frowning_). No. That cannot be. A beggar cannot cry for  bread who has no tongue.    THE SERVANT. Behold he can--if he has grown another.    THE KING. What! Why, men are not given more than one tongue in a  lifetime. To have more than one tongue is treason.    THE SERVANT. If it is treason to have more than one tongue, O  king, then is this beggar surely guilty of treason.    THE KING (_pompously_). The punishment for treason is death. See to  it that the fellow is slain. And do not fan me so languidly. I am  very warm.    THE SERVANT (_fanning more rapidly_). Behold, O great and  illustrious king, all thy commands were obeyed even yesterday.    THE KING. How! Do not jest with thy king.    THE SERVANT. If I jest, then there is truth in a jest. Even  yesterday, O king, as I have told thee, the beggar which thou now  hearest crying aloud in the street was slain by thy soldiers with  a sword.    THE KING. Do ghosts eat bread? Forsooth, men who have been slain  with a sword do not go about in the streets crying for a piece of  bread.    THE SERVANT. Forsooth, they do if they are fashioned as this  beggar.    THE KING. Why, he is but a man. Surely he cannot have more than  one life in a lifetime.    THE SERVANT. Listen to a tale, O king, which happened yesterday.    THE KING. I am listening.    THE SERVANT. Thy soldiers smote this beggar for crying aloud in  the streets for bread, but his wounds are already healed. They  cut out his tongue, but he immediately grew another. They slew  him, yet he is now alive.    THE KING. Ah! that is a tale which I cannot understand at all.    THE SERVANT. O king, it may be well.    THE KING. I cannot understand what thou sayest, either.    THE SERVANT. O king, that may be well also.    THE KING. Thou art speaking now in riddles. I do not like  riddles. They confuse my brain.    THE SERVANT. Behold, O king, if I speak in riddles it is because  a riddle has come to pass.    (THE BEGGAR'S _voice suddenly cries out loudly._)    THE BEGGAR (_outside_). Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.    THE KING. Ah! He is crying out again. His voice seems to me  louder than it was before.    THE SERVANT. Hunger is as food to the lungs, O king.    THE KING. His lungs I will wager are well fed. Ha, ha!    THE SERVANT. But alas! his stomach is quite empty.    THE KING. That is not my business.    THE SERVANT. Should I not perhaps fling him a crust from the  window?    THE KING. No! To feed a beggar is always foolish. Every crumb  that is given to a beggar is an evil seed from which springs  another fellow like him.    THE BEGGAR (_outside_). Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.    THE SERVANT. He seems very hungry, O king.    THE KING. Yes. So I should judge.    THE SERVANT. If thou wilt not let me fling, him a piece of bread  thine ears must pay the debts of thy hand.    THE KING. A king can have no debts.    THE SERVANT. That is true, O king. Even so, the noise of this  fellow's begging must annoy thee greatly.    THE KING. It does.    THE SERVANT. Doubtless he craves only a small crust from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],[0,"The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#7)"],[1,"others ... those  golden days wherein were practised the Triumphs and Trophies of Cookery,  then was Hospitality esteemed and Neighbourhood preserved, the Poor  cherished and God honoured; then was Religion less talk't on and more  practis't, then was Atheism and Schisme less in Fashion, and then did men  strive to be good rather than to seem so.\" High-souled were the _chefs_ of  the seventeenth century!    The 1669 edition of _The Closet Opened_ is evidently the first. The  interleaved example mentioned in the Catalogue of the Digby Library is of  the same date. Whoever prepared it for the press and wrote the egregious  preface \"To the Reader\"--Hartman, or as I think, another--gave it the  title; but it was a borrowed one. Some years earlier, in 1655, had appeared  _The Queen's Closet Opened, Incomparable Secrets which were presented unto  the Queen by the most Experienced Persons of the Times, many wherof were  had in Esteem when she pleased to descend to Private Recreation_. The  Queen, of course, is Henrietta Maria, and chief among the \"Experienced  Persons\" referred to was certainly her Chancellor, Digby. Possibly he may  even have suggested the printing of the collection. Like titles are met  with again and again. _Nature's Cabinet Opened_, a medical work, was  attributed to Browne, though he repudiated it. Ruthven's book I have  already alluded to. _The Queen-like Closet_, a Rich Cabinet, by Hannah  Wolly, came out in 1670.    Of the two books, the Queen's and her Chancellor's, Digby's has afforded me  by far the most delight. Though many of the receipts are evidently given as  sent in, the stamp of his personality is on the whole; and he is the poet  of all these culinary artists. But on the score of usefulness to the  housewife I forbear all judgment. The recipes may be thought extravagant in  these late hard times--though epicurism has changed rather than vanished.  Lord Bacon's receipt for making \"Manus Christi for the Stomach\" begins,  \"Take of the best pearls very finely pulverised one drachm\"; and a health  resolution runs, \"To take once during supper wine in which gold is  quenched.\" Costly ingredients such as pearls and leaf gold appear only once  among Digby's receipts. The modern housewife may be aghast at the thought  of more than a hundred ways of making mead and metheglin. Mead recalls to  her perhaps her first history-book, wherein she learnt of it as a drink of  the primitive Anglo-Saxons. If she doubt the usefulness of the collection  in her own kitchen, let her take the little volume to her boudoir, and read  it there as gossiping notes of the _beau monde_ in the days when James I  and the Charleses ruled the land. She will find herself in lofty company,  and on intimate terms with them. They come down to our level, without any  show of condescension. Lords and ladies who were personages of a solemn  state pageant, are now human neighbourly creatures, owning to likes and  dislikes, and letting us into the secrets of their daily habits.    It pleases me to think of Henrietta Maria, in her exile, busying herself in  her still-room, and forgetting her dangers and sorrows in simpling and  stilling and kitchen messes; and of her devoted Sir Kenelm, in the moments  when he is neither abeting her Royalist plots, nor diverting her mind to  matters of high science, or the mysteries of the Faith, but bringing to her  such lowlier consolations as are hinted in \"Hydromel as I made it weak for  the Queen Mother.\" We are not waiting in a chill ante-chamber when we read,  \"The Queen's ordinary Bouillon de Sante in a morning was thus,\" or of the  Pressis which she \"used to take at nights--of great yet temperate  nourishment--instead of a Supper.\" And who can hint at Court scandals in  the face of such evidence of domesticity as \"The Queen useth to baste meat  with yolks of fresh eggs, &c.\" or \"The way that the Countess de Penalva  makes the Portuguese eggs for the Queen is this\"? We cannot help being  interested in the habits of Lady Hungerford, who \"useth to make her mead at  the end of summer, when she takes up her Honey, and begins to drink it in  Lent.\" My Lady Gower and her husband were of independent tastes. Each had  their own receipts. It must be remembered that Dr. Johnson said no woman  could write a cookery-book; and he threatened to write one himself. And Sir  Kenelm had many serious rivals among his own sex.    In such an _embarras de choix_ as given by all these drink receipts, we may  be in doubt whether to try \"My Lord Gorge's Meath,\" or \"The Countess of  Newport's\" cherry wine, or \"The sweet drink of my Lady Stuart,\" or of Lady  Windebanke, or \"Sir Paul Neile's way of making cider,\" or \"my Lord  Carlisle's Sack posset\"; but one is strongly influenced by such a note as  \"Sir Edward Bainton's Receipt which my Lord of Portland (who gave it me)  saith, was the best he ever drank.\" I had thought of Saint-Evremond as  warrior and wit, delightful satirist and letter-writer. But here is a  streak of new light upon him: \"Monsieur St. Euvremont makes thus his potage  de sante of boiled meat for dinner being very valetudinary.... When he is  in pretty good health, that he may venture upon more savoury hotter things,  &c.\" The most rigorous Protestants will relax to hear how \"To make a Pan  Cotto as the Cardinals use in Rome.\" And if \"My Lord Lumley's Pease  Pottage\" sounds homely, be it known, on the word of the eloquent Robert  May, that his lordship \"wanted no knowledge in the discerning this  mystery.\" What fastidious simplicity in the taste of the great is suggested  by \"My Lord d'Aubigny eats Red-herrings thus boiled\"!    But if Sir Kenelm consorted only with the great, it was with the great of  all social ranks. It was not merely on high questions of science he  discoursed with the discoverer of the circulation of the blood--witness  \"Dr. Harvey's pleasant water cider.\" Then there was that \"Chief Burgomaster  of Antwerpe,\" with whom he must have been on pretty intimate terms, to  learn that he \"used for many years to drink no other drink but this [mead];  at Meals and all times, even for pledging of healths. And though He was an  old man, he was of an extraordinary vigor every way, and had every year a  Child, had always a great appetite, and good digestion; and yet was not  fat.\" Digby was too great a gentleman to be above exchanging receipts with  the professors of the \"mystery,\" such as the Muscovian Ambassador's  steward; and when \"Master Webbe who maketh the King's meath,\" on the 1st of  September, 1663, came to his house to make some for him, Sir Kenelm stood  by, a little suspicious lest the other great artist was bamboozling him. He  had an eye for all--though it may have been one of his correspondents who  says of the remnants of a dish that it \"will make good Water-gruel for the  Servants.\"    The seriousness of the business is tremendous; and to ignore the fine  shades in the 106 receipts for mead and metheglin would have been a  frivolity unknown in Digby's circle. There is care; there is conscience;  there is rivalry. The ingredients are mingled with a nice discrimination  between the rights of the palate and the maintenance of health. \"Use only  Morello cherries (I think) for pleasure, and black ones for health.\" You  may not wait your own convenience in such serious business. \"It is best  made by taking all the Canicular days into your fermentation.\" Now and  again other methods of calculating than ours are used; but \"whiles you can  say the Miserere Psalm very leisurely\" is as easily computed as \"while your  Pulse beateth 200 stroaks.\" Quantities are a more difficult affair. How is  one to know how much smallage was got for a penny in mid-seventeenth  century? The great connoisseur Lord Lumley is very lax, and owns that his  are \"set down by guess.\"    It is a curious old world we get glimpses of, at once barbarous, simple,  and extravagant, when great ladies were expected to see to the milking of  their cows, as closely as Joan Cromwell supervised her milch-kine in St.  James's Park, and to the cleanliness of their servants' arms and hands, and  when huntsmen rode at the bidding of the cook; for in order that venison be  in good condition, \"before the deer be killed he ought to be hunted and  chased as much as possible.\" The perusal of the section, \"To Feed  Chickens,\" will shock our poultry-breeders. \"To make them prodigiously fat  in about twelve days,\" \"My Lady Fanshawe gives them strong ale. They will  be very drunk and sleep; then eat again. Let a candle stand all night over  the coop, and then they will eat much all the night.\"    \"Lord Denbigh's Almond Marchpane,\" and the 'current wine' of which it is  said \"You may drink safely long draughts of it,\" will appeal perhaps only  to the schoolboy of our weaker generation. Yet there are receipts,  doubtless gathered in Sir Kenelm's later years, that have the cautious  invalid in view. Of these are the \"Pleasant Cordial Tablets, which are  very comforting and strengthen nature much,\" and the liquor which is called  \"smoothing.\" \"In health you may dash the Potage with a little juyce of  Orange\" is in the same low key. The gruels are so many that we must wish  Mr. Woodhouse had known of the book. If the admixture of \"wood-sorrel and  currens\" had seemed to him fraught with peril, he could have fallen back on  the \"Oatmeal Pap of Sir John Colladon.\"    Where are all the old dishes vanished to? Who has ever known \"A smoothening  Quiddany of Quinces?\" Who can tell the composition of a Tansy? These are  tame days when we have forgotten how to make Cock-Ale. They drank 'Sack  with Clove-gilly-flowers' at the \"Mermaid,\" I am sure. What is Bragot? What  is Stepony? And what Slipp-coat Cheese? Ask the baker for a Manchet. The  old names call for a _Ballade. Ou sont les mets d'antan?_ And, cooks, with  all your exactness about pounds and ounces and minutes of the clock, can  you better directions like these?
