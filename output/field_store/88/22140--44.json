Got to the Cape. Where is the ship with  the things? Lost--gone to the bottom! And the box with the money?  Lost--nothing saved!    \"My wife wrote to the Duke of Wellington's nephew; I didn't wish her to;  she did it without my knowledge.    \"What did the man whose life I saved do? Did he send me thirty thousand  pounds? say, 'Bonaparte, my brother, here is a crumb?' No; he sent me  nothing.    \"My wife said, 'Write.' I said, 'Mary Ann, NO. While these hands have  power to work, NO. While this frame has power to endure, NO. Never shall  it be said that Bonaparte Blenkins asked of any man.'\"    The man's noble independence touched the German.    \"Your case is hard; yes, that is hard,\" said the German, shaking his  head.    Bonaparte took another draught of the soup, leaned back against the  pillows, and sighed deeply.    \"I think,\" he said after a while, rousing himself, \"I shall now wander  in the benign air, and taste the gentle cool of evening. The stiffness  hovers over me yet; exercise is beneficial.\"    So saying, he adjusted his hat carefully on the bald crown of his head,  and moved to the door. After he had gone the German sighed again over  his work:    \"Ah, Lord! So it is! Ah!\"    He thought of the ingratitude of the world.    \"Uncle Otto,\" said the child in the doorway, \"did you ever hear of ten  bears sitting on their tails in a circle?\"    \"Well, not of ten exactly: but bears do attack travellers every day. It  is nothing unheard of,\" said the German. \"A man of such courage, too!  Terrible experience that!\"    \"And how do we know that the story is true, Uncle Otto?\"    The German's ire was roused.    \"That is what I do hate!\" he cried. \"Know that is true! How do you know  that anything is true? Because you are told so. If we begin to question  everything--proof, proof, proof, what will we have to believe left?  How do you know the angel opened the prison door for Peter, except that  Peter said so? How do you know that God talked to Moses, except that  Moses wrote it? That is what I hate!\"    The girl knit her brows. Perhaps her thoughts made a longer journey than  the German dreamed of; for, mark you, the old dream little how their  words and lives are texts and studies to the generation that shall  succeed them. Not what we are taught, but what we see, makes us, and the  child gathers the food on which the adult feeds to the end.    When the German looked up next there was a look of supreme satisfaction  in the little mouth and the beautiful eyes.    \"What dost see, chicken?\" he asked.    The child said nothing, and an agonizing shriek was borne on the  afternoon breeze.    \"Oh, God! my God! I am killed!\" cried the voice of Bonaparte, as he,  with wide open mouth and shaking flesh, fell into the room, followed by  a half-grown ostrich, who put its head in at the door, opened its beak  at him, and went away.    \"Shut the door! shut the door! As you value my life, shut the door!\"  cried Bonaparte, sinking into a chair, his face blue and white, with  a greenishness about the mouth. \"Ah, my friend,\" he said tremulously,  \"eternity has looked me in the face! My life's thread hung upon a cord!  The valley of the shadow of death!\" said Bonaparte, seizing the German's  arm.    \"Dear, dear, dear!\" said the German, who had closed the lower half of  the door, and stood much concerned beside the stranger, \"you have had a  fright. I never knew so young a bird to chase before; but they will take  dislikes to certain people. I sent a boy away once because a bird would  chase him. Ah, dear, dear!\"    \"When I looked round,\" said Bonaparte, \"the red and yawning cavity was  above me, and the reprehensible paw raised to strike me. My nerves,\"  said Bonaparte, suddenly growing faint, \"always delicate--highly  strung--are broken--broken! You could not give a little wine, a little  brandy my friend?\"    The old German hurried away to the bookshelf, and took from behind  the books a small bottle, half of whose contents he poured into a cup.  Bonaparte drained it eagerly.    \"How do you feel now?\" asked the German, looking at him with much  sympathy.    \"A little, slightly, better.\"    The German went out to pick up the battered chimneypot which had fallen  before the door.    \"I am sorry you got the fright. The birds are bad things till you know  them,\" he said sympathetically, as he put the hat down.    \"My friend,\" said Bonaparte, holding out his hand, \"I forgive you; do  not be disturbed. Whatever the consequences, I forgive you. I know, I  believe, it was with no ill-intent that you allowed me to go out. Give  me your hand. I have no ill-feeling; none!\"    \"You are very kind,\" said the German, taking the extended hand, and  feeling suddenly convinced that he was receiving magnanimous forgiveness  for some great injury, \"you are very kind.\"    \"Don't mention it,\" said Bonaparte.    He knocked out the crown of his caved-in old hat, placed it on the table  before him, leaned his elbows on the table and his face in his hands,  and contemplated it.    \"Ah, my old friend,\" he thus apostrophized the hat, \"you have served me  long, you have served me faithfully, but the last day has come. Never  more shall you be borne upon the head of your master. Never more shall  you protect his brow from the burning rays of summer or the cutting  winds of winter. Henceforth bare-headed must your master go. Good-bye,  good-bye, old hat!\"    At the end of this affecting appeal the German rose. He went to the  box at the foot of his bed; out of it he took a black hat, which had  evidently been seldom worn and carefully preserved.    \"It's not exactly what you may have been accustomed to,\" he said  nervously, putting it down beside the battered chimneypot, \"but it might  be of some use--a protection to the head, you know.\"    \"My friend,\" said Bonaparte, \"you are not following my advice; you are  allowing yourself to be reproached on my account. Do not make yourself  unhappy. No; I shall go bare-headed.\"    \"No, no, no!\" cried the German energetically. \"I have no use for the  hat, none at all. It is shut up in the box.\"    \"Then I will take it, my friend. It is a comfort to one's own mind when  you have unintentionally injured any one to make reparation. I know the  feeling. The hat may not be of that refined cut of which the old one  was, but it will serve, yes, it will serve. Thank you,\" said Bonaparte,  adjusting it on his head, and then replacing it on the table. \"I shall  lie down now and take a little repose,\" he added; \"I much fear my  appetite for supper will be lost.\"    \"I hope not, I hope not,\" said the German, reseating himself at his  work, and looking much concerned as Bonaparte stretched himself on the  bed and turned the end of the patchwork quilt over his feet.    \"You must not think to make your departure, not for many days,\" said the  German presently. \"Tant Sannie gives her consent, and--\"    \"My friend,\" said Bonaparte, closing his eyes sadly, \"you are kind; but  were it not that tomorrow is the Sabbath, weak and trembling as I lie  here, I would proceed on my way. I must seek work; idleness but for a  day is painful. Work, labour--that is the secret of all true happiness!\"    He doubled the pillar under his head, and watched how the German drew  the leather thongs in and out.    After a while Lyndall silently put her book on the shelf and went  home, and the German stood up and began to mix some water and meal for  roaster-cakes. As he stirred them with his hands he said:    \"I make always a double supply on Saturday night; the hands are then  free as the thoughts for Sunday.\"    \"The blessed Sabbath!\" said Bonaparte.    There was a pause. Bonaparte twisted his eyes without moving his head,  to see if supper were already on the fire.    \"You must sorely miss the administration of the Lord's word in this  desolate spot,\" added Bonaparte. \"Oh, how love I Thine house, and the  place where Thine honour dwelleth!\"    \"Well, we do; yes,\" said the German; \"but we do our best. We meet  together, and I--well, I say a few words, and perhaps they are not  wholly lost, not quite.\"    \"Strange coincidence,\" said Bonaparte; \"my plan always was the same.  Was in the Free State once--solitary farm--one neighbour. Every Sunday  I called together friend and neighbour, child and servant, and said,  'Rejoice with me, that we may serve the Lord,' and then I addressed  them. Ah, those were blessed times,\" said Bonaparte; \"would they might  return.\"    The German stirred at the cakes, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred.  He could give the stranger his bed, and he could give the stranger his  hat, and he could give the stranger his brandy; but his Sunday service!    After a good while he said:    \"I might speak to Tant Sannie; I might arrange; you might take the  service in my place, if it--\"    \"My friend,\" said Bonaparte, \"it would give me the profoundest felicity,  the most unbounded satisfaction; but in these worn-out habiliments, in  these deteriorated garments, it would not be possible, it would not be  fitting that I should officiate in service of One whom, for respect, we  shall not name. No, my friend, I will remain here; and, while you are  assembling yourselves together in the presence of the Lord, I, in my  solitude, will think of and pray for you. No; I will remain here!\"    It was a touching picture--the solitary man there praying for them. The  German cleared his hands from the meal, and went to the chest from which  he had taken the black hat. After a little careful feeling about, he  produced a black cloth coat, trousers, and waistcoat, which he laid on  the table, smiling knowingly. They were of new shining cloth, worn twice  a year, when he went to the town to nachtmaal. He looked with great  pride at the coat as he unfolded it and held it up.    \"It's not the latest fashion, perhaps, not a West End cut, not exactly;  but it might do; it might serve at a push. Try it on, try it on!\" he"]]]
