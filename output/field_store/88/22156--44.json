It has appeared in the worship of the Church, the hymns of the  Church, the tendencies to asceticism, the depreciation of earth and man.  Christianity, therefore, fully meets Brahmanism on its positive side,  while it fulfils its negations, as we shall see hereafter, by adding as  full a recognition of man and nature.    The positive side of Buddhism is its cognition of the human soul and the  natural laws of the universe. Now, if we look into the New Testament and  into the history of the Church, we find this element also fully expressed.  It appears in all the parables and teachings of Jesus, in which man is  represented as a responsible agent, rewarded or punished according to the  exact measure of his works; receiving the government of ten or five cities  according to his stewardship. And when we look into the practical working  of Christianity we find almost an exaggerated stress laid on the duty of  saving one's soul. This excessive estimate is chiefly seen in the monastic  system of the Roman Church, and in the Calvinistic sects of Protestantism.  It also comes to light again, curiously enough, in such books as Combe's  \"Constitution of Man,\" the theory of which is exactly the same as that of  the Buddhists; namely, that the aim of life is a prudential virtue,  consisting in wise obedience to the natural laws of the universe. Both  systems substitute prudence for Providence as the arbiter of human  destiny. But, apart from these special tendencies in Christianity, it  cannot be doubted that all Christian experience recognizes the positive  truth of Buddhism in regarding the human soul as a substantial, finite,  but progressive monad, not to be absorbed, as in Brahmanism, in the abyss  of absolute being.    The positive side of the system of Confucius is the organization of the  state on the basis of the family. The government of the emperor is  paternal government, the obedience of the subject is filial obedience.  Now, though Jesus did not for the first time call God \"the Father,\" he  first brought men into a truly filial relation to God. The Roman Church is  organized on the family idea. The word \"Pope\" means the \"Father\"; he is  the father of the whole Church. Every bishop and every priest is also the  father of a smaller family, and all those born into the Church are its  children, as all born into a family are born sons and daughters of the  family. In Protestantism, also, society is composed of families as the  body is made up of cells. Only in China, and in Christendom, is family  life thus sacred and worshipful. In some patriarchal systems, polygamy  annuls the wife and the mother; in others the father is a despot, and the  children slaves; in other systems, the crushing authority of the state  destroys the independence of the household. Christianity alone accepts  with China the religion of family life with all its conservative elements,  while it fulfils it with the larger hope of the kingdom of heaven and  brotherhood of mankind.    This idea of the kingdom of heaven, so central in Christianity, is also  the essential motive in the religion of Zoroaster. As, in the Zend Avesta,  every man is a soldier, fighting for light or for darkness, and neutrality  is impossible; so, in the Gospel, light and good stand opposed to darkness  and evil as perpetual foes. A certain current of dualism runs through the  Christian Scriptures and the teaching of the Church. God and Satan, heaven  and hell, are the only alternatives. Every one must choose between them.  In the current theology, this dualism has been so emphasized as even to  exceed that of the Zend Avesta. The doctrine of everlasting punishment and  an everlasting hell has always been the orthodox doctrine in Christianity,  while the Zend Avesta probably, and the religion in its subsequent  development certainly, teaches universal restoration, and the ultimate  triumph of good over evil. Nevertheless, practically, in consequence of  the greater richness and fulness of Christianity, this tendency to dualism  has been neutralized by its monotheism, and evil kept subordinate; while,  in the Zend religion, the evil principle assumed such proportions as to  make it the formidable rival of good in the mind of the worshipper. Here,  as before, we may say that Christianity is able to do justice to all the  truth involved in the doctrine of evil, avoiding any superficial optimism,  and recognizing the fact that all true life must partake of the nature of  a battle.    The positive side of Egyptian religion we saw to be a recognition of the  divine element in nature, of that plastic, mysterious life which embodies  itself in all organisms. Of this view we find little stated explicitly in  the New Testament. But that the principles of Christianity contain it,  implicitly, in an undeveloped form, appears, (1.) Because Christian  monotheism differs from Jewish and Mohammedan monotheism, in recognizing  God \"_in all things_\" as well as God \"_above all things_.\" (2.) Because  Christian art and literature differ from classic art and literature in the  _romantic_ element, which is exactly the sense of this mysterious life in  nature. The classic artist is a [Greek: poietes], a maker; the romantic  artist is a troubadour, a finder. The one does his work in giving form to  a dead material; the other, by seeking for its hidden life. (3.) Because  modern science is _invention_, i.e. finding. It recognizes mysteries in  nature which are to be searched into, and this search becomes a serious  religious interest with all truly scientific men. It appears to such men a  profanity to doubt or question the revelations of nature, and they believe  in its infallible inspiration quite as much as the dogmatist believes in  the infallible inspiration of Scripture, or the churchman in the  infallible inspiration of the Church. We may, therefore, say, that the  essential truth in the Egyptian system has been taken up into our modern  Christian life.    And how is it, lastly, with that opposite pole of religious thought which  blossomed out in \"the fair humanities of old religion\" in the wonderful  Hellenic mind? The gods of Greece were men. They were not abstract ideas,  concealing natural powers and laws. They were open as sunshine, bright as  noon, a fair company of men and women idealized and gracious, just a  little way off, a little way up. It was humanity projected upon the skies,  divine creatures of more than mortal beauty, but thrilling with human life  and human sympathies. Has Christianity anything to offer in the place of  this charming system of human gods and goddesses?    We answer that the fundamental doctrine of Christianity is the  incarnation, the word made flesh. It is God revealed in man. Under some  doctrinal type this has always been believed. The common Trinitarian  doctrine states it in a somewhat crude and illogical form. Yet somehow the  man Christ Jesus has always been seen to be the best revelation of God.  But unless there were some human element in the Deity, he could not reveal  himself so in a human life. The doctrine of the incarnation, therefore,  repeats the Mosaic statement that \"man was made in the image of God.\"  Jewish and Mohammedan monotheism separate God entirely from the world.  Philosophic monotheism, in our day, separates God from man, by teaching  that there is nothing in common between the two by which God can be  mediated, and so makes him wholly incomprehensible. Christianity gives us  Emmanuel, God with us, equally removed from the stern despotic omnipotence  of the Semitic monotheism and the finite and imperfect humanities of  Olympus. We see God in Christ, as full of sympathy with man, God \"in us  all\"; and yet we see him in nature, providence, history, as \"above all\"  and \"through all.\" The Roman Catholic Church has, perhaps, humanized  religion too far. For every god and goddess of Greece she has given us, on  some immortal canvas, an archangel or a saint to be adored and loved.  Instead of Apollo and the Python we have Guido's St. Michael and the  Dragon; in place of the light, airy Mercury she provides a St. Sebastian;  instead of the \"untouched\" Diana, some heavenly Agnes or Cecilia. The  Catholic heaven is peopled, all the way up, with beautiful human forms;  and on the upper throne we have holiness and tenderness incarnate in the  queen of heaven and her divine Son. All the Greek humanities are thus  fulfilled in the ample faith of Christendom.    By such a critical survey as we have thus sketched in mere outline it will  be seen that each of the great ethnic religions is full on one side, but  empty on the other, while Christianity is full all round. Christianity is  adapted to take their place, not because they are false, but because they  are true as far as they go. They \"know in part and prophesy in part; but  when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be  done away.\"        Sec. 8. Comparative Theology will probably show that Ethnic Religions are  arrested, or degenerate, and will come to an End, while the Catholic  Religion is capable of a progressive Development.      The religions of Persia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, have come to an end; having  shared the fate of the national civilization of which each was a part. The  religions of China, Islam, Buddha, and Judaea have all been arrested, and  remain unchanged and seemingly unchangeable. Like great vessels anchored  in a stream, the current of time flows past them, and each year they are  further behind the spirit of the age, and less in harmony with its  demands. Christianity alone, of all human religions, seems to possess the  power of keeping abreast with the advancing civilization of the world. As  the child's soul grows with his body, so that when he becomes a man it is  a man's soul and not a child's, so the Gospel of Jesus continues the soul  of all human culture.

A Frenchman is not now impelled by any strong  interest either to exaggerate or to underrate the power of the Kings of  the house of Valois. The privileges of the States General, of the States  of Britanny, of the States of Burgundy, are to him matters of as little  practical importance as the constitution of the Jewish Sanhedrim or of  the Amphictyonic Council. The gulph of a great revolution completely  separates the new from the old system. No such chasm divides the  existence of the English nation into two distinct parts. Our laws and  customs have never been lost in general and irreparable ruin. With us  the precedents of the middle ages are still valid precedents, and are  still cited, on the gravest occasions, by the most eminent Statesmen.  For example, when King George the Third was attacked by the malady which  made him incapable of performing his regal functions, and when the most  distinguished lawyers and politicians differed widely as to the course  which ought, in such circumstances, to be pursued, the Houses of  Parliament would not proceed to discuss any plan of regency till all  the precedents which were to be found in our annals, from the earliest  times, had been collected and arranged. Committees were appointed to  examine the ancient records of the realm. The first case reported was  that of the year 1217: much importance was attached to the cases of  1326, of 1377, and of 1422: but the case which was justly considered  as most in point was that of 1455. Thus in our country the dearest  interests of parties have frequently been on the results of the  researches of antiquaries. The inevitable consequence was that our  antiquaries conducted their researches in the spirit of partisans.    It is therefore not surprising that those who have written, concerning  the limits of prerogative and liberty in the old polity of England  should generally have shown the temper, not of judges, but of angry and  uncandid advocates. For they were discussing, not a speculative matter,  but a matter which had a direct and practical connection with the most  momentous and exciting disputes of their own day. From the commencement  of the long contest between the Parliament and the Stuarts down to the  time when the pretensions of the Stuarts ceased to be formidable, few  questions were practically more important than the question whether the  administration of that family had or had not been in accordance with the  ancient constitution of the kingdom. This question could be decided only  by reference to the records of preceding reigns. Bracton and Fleta, the  Mirror of Justice and the Rolls of Parliament, were ransacked to find  pretexts for the excesses of the Star Chamber on one side, and of the  High Court of Justice on the other. During a long course of years every  Whig historian was anxious to prove that the old English government was  all but republican, every Tory historian to prove that it was all but  despotic.    With such feelings, both parties looked into the chronicles of the  middle ages. Both readily found what they sought; and both obstinately  refused to see anything but what they sought. The champions of the  Stuarts could easily point out instances of oppression exercised on  the subject. The defenders of the Roundheads could as easily produce  instances of determined and successful resistance offered to the Crown.  The Tories quoted, from ancient writings, expressions almost as servile  as were heard from the pulpit of Mainwaring. The Whigs discovered  expressions as bold and severe as any that resounded from the judgment  seat of Bradshaw. One set of writers adduced numerous instances in which  Kings had extorted money without the authority of Parliament. Another  set cited cases in which the Parliament had assumed to itself the power  of inflicting punishment on Kings. Those who saw only one half of the  evidence would have concluded that the Plantagenets were as absolute  as the Sultans of Turkey: those who saw only the other half would have  concluded that the Plantagenets had as little real power as the Doges  of Venice; and both conclusions would have been equally remote from the  truth.    The old English government was one of a class of limited monarchies  which sprang up in Western Europe during the middle ages, and which,  notwithstanding many diversities, bore to one another a strong family  likeness. That there should have been such a likeness is not strange The  countries in which those monarchies arose had been provinces of the same  great civilised empire, and had been overrun and conquered, about the  same time, by tribes of the same rude and warlike nation. They were  members of the same great coalition against Islam. They were in  communion with the same superb and ambitious Church. Their polity  naturally took the same form. They had institutions derived partly from  imperial Rome, partly from papal Rome, partly from the old Germany.  All had Kings; and in all the kingly office became by degrees strictly  hereditary. All had nobles bearing titles which had originally indicated  military rank. The dignity of knighthood, the rules of heraldry, were  common to all. All had richly endowed ecclesiastical establishments,  municipal corporations enjoying large franchises, and senates whose  consent was necessary to the validity of some public acts.    Of these kindred constitutions the English was, from an early period,  justly reputed the best. The prerogatives of the sovereign were  undoubtedly extensive. The spirit of religion and the spirit of chivalry  concurred to exalt his dignity. The sacred oil had been poured on his  head. It was no disparagement to the bravest and noblest knights to  kneel at his feet. His person was inviolable. He alone was entitled to  convoke the Estates of the realm: he could at his pleasure dismiss them;  and his assent was necessary to all their legislative acts. He was the  chief of the executive administration, the sole organ of communication  with foreign powers, the captain of the military and naval forces of the  state, the fountain of justice, of mercy, and of honour. He had large  powers for the regulation of trade. It was by him that money was  coined, that weights and measures were fixed, that marts and havens  were appointed. His ecclesiastical patronage was immense. His hereditary  revenues, economically administered, sufficed to meet the ordinary  charges of government. His own domains were of vast extent. He was also  feudal lord paramount of the whole soil of his kingdom, and, in that  capacity, possessed many lucrative and many formidable rights, which  enabled him to annoy and depress those who thwarted him, and to enrich  and aggrandise, without any cost to himself, those who enjoyed his  favour.    But his power, though ample, was limited by three great constitutional  principles, so ancient that none can say when they began to exist,  so potent that their natural development, continued through many  generations, has produced the order of things under which we now live.    First, the King could not legislate without the consent of his  Parliament. Secondly, he could impose no tax without the consent of  his Parliament. Thirdly, he was bound to conduct the executive  administration according to the laws of the land, and, if he broke those  laws, his advisers and his agents were responsible.    No candid Tory will deny that these principles had, five hundred years  ago, acquired the authority of fundamental rules. On the other hand,  no candid Whig will affirm that they were, till a later period, cleared  from all ambiguity, or followed out to all their consequences. A  constitution of the middle ages was not, like a constitution of the  eighteenth or nineteenth century, created entire by a single act,  and fully set forth in a single document. It is only in a refined  and speculative age that a polity is constructed on system. In rude  societies the progress of government resembles the progress of language  and of versification. Rude societies have language, and often copious  and energetic language: but they have no scientific grammar, no  definitions of nouns and verbs, no names for declensions, moods, tenses,  and voices. Rude societies have versification, and often versification  of great power and sweetness: but they have no metrical canons; and the  minstrel whose numbers, regulated solely by his ear, are the delight  of his audience, would himself be unable to say of how many dactyls and  trochees each of his lines consists. As eloquence exists before syntax,  and song before prosody, so government may exist in a high degree  of excellence long before the limits of legislative, executive, and  judicial power have been traced with precision.    It was thus in our country. The line which bounded the royal  prerogative, though in general sufficiently clear, had not everywhere  been drawn with accuracy and distinctness. There was, therefore, near  the border some debatable ground on which incursions and reprisals  continued to take place, till, after ages of strife, plain and durable  landmarks were at length set up. It may be instructive to note in what  way, and to what extent, our ancient sovereigns were in the habit of  violating the three great principles by which the liberties of the  nation were protected.    No English King has ever laid claim to the general legislative power.  The most violent and imperious Plantagenet never fancied himself  competent to enact, without the consent of his great council, that a  jury should consist of ten persons instead of twelve, that a widow's  dower should be a fourth part instead of a third, that perjury should  be a felony, or that the custom of gavelkind should be introduced into  Yorkshire. [2] But the King had the power of pardoning offenders; and  there is one point at which the power of pardoning and the "]]]
