If you take your stand firmly with France and Russia there  will be no war. If you fail them now, rivers of blood will flow, and you  will in the end be dragged into war.\" He was precisely right; but he did  not realize that war was exactly what our Junkers wanted. They did not  dare to tell themselves so; and naturally they did not dare to tell him  so. And perhaps his own interest in war was too strong to make him  regret the rejection of his honest advice. To break up the Austrian  Empire and achieve for Russia the Slav Caliphate of South-East Europe  whilst defeating Prussia with the help of France and of Russia's old  enemy and Prussia's old ally England, was a temptation so enormous that  Sazonoff, in resisting it so far as to shew Sir Edward Grey frankly the  only chance of preventing it, proved himself the most genuine  humanitarian in the diplomatic world.      *Number 123.*    The decisive communication between Sir Edward Grey and Prince Lichnowsky  is recorded in the famous No. 123. With the rather childish subsequent  attempt to minimize No. 123 on the ground that the Prince was merely an  amiable nincompoop who did not really represent his fiendish sovereign,  neither I nor any other serious person need be concerned. What is beyond  all controversy is that after that conversation Prince Lichnowsky could  do nothing but tell the Kaiser that the _Entente_, having at last got  his imperial head in chancery, was not going to let him off on any  terms, and that it was now a fight to a finish between the British and  German empires. Then the Kaiser said: \"We are Germans. God help us!\"  When a crowd of foolish students came cheering for the war under his  windows, he bade them go to the churches and pray. His telegrams to the  Tsar (the omission of which from the penny bluebook is, to say the  least, not chivalrous) were dignified and pathetic. And when the  Germans, taking a line from the poet they call \"unser Shakespeare,\"  said: \"Come the four quarters of the world in arms and we shall shock  them,\" it was, from the romantic militarist point of view, fine. What  Junker-led men could do they have since done to make that thrasonical  brag good. But there is no getting over the fact that, in Tommy Atkins's  phrase, they had asked for it. Their Junkers, like ours, had drunk to  The Day; and they should not have let us choose it after riling us for  so many years. And that is why Sir Edward had a great surprise when he  at last owned up in Parliament.      *How the Nation Took It.*    The moment he said that we could not \"stand aside with our arms folded\"  and see our friend and neighbour France \"bombarded and battered,\" the  whole nation rose to applaud him. All the Foreign Office distrust of  public opinion, the concealment of the Anglo-French plan of campaign,  the disguise of the _Entente_ in a quaker's hat, the duping of the  British public and the Kaiser with one and the same prevarication, had  been totally unnecessary and unpopular, like most of these ingenuities  which diplomatists think subtle and Machiavellian. The British Public  had all along been behind Mr. Winston Churchill. It had wanted Sir  Edward to do just what Sazonoff wanted him to do, and what I, in the  columns of _The Daily News_ proposed he should do nine months ago (I  must really be allowed to claim that I am not merely wise after the  event), which was to arm to the teeth regardless of an expense which to  us would have been a mere fleabite, and tell Germany that if she, laid a  finger on France we would unite with France to defeat her, offering her  at the same time as consolation for that threat, the assurance that we  would do as much to France if she wantonly broke the peace in the like  fashion by attacking Germany. No unofficial Englishman worth his salt  wanted to snivel hypocritically about our love of peace and our respect  for treaties and our solemn acceptance of a painful duty, and all the  rest of the nauseous mixture of school-master's twaddle, parish magazine  cant, and cinematograph melodrama with which we were deluged. We were  perfectly ready to knock the Kaiser's head off just to teach him that if  he thought he was going to ride roughshod over Europe, including our new  friends the French, and the plucky little Belgians, he was reckoning  without old England. And in this pugnacious but perfectly  straightforward and human attitude the nation needed no excuses because  the nation honestly did not know that we were taking the Kaiser at a  disadvantage, or that the Franco-Russian alliance had been just as much  a menace to peace as the Austro-German one. But the Foreign Office knew  that very well, and therefore began to manufacture superfluous,  disingenuous, and rather sickening excuses at a great rate. The nation  had a clean conscience, and was really innocent of any aggressive  strategy: the Foreign Office was redhanded, and did not want to be found  out. Hence its sermons.      *Mr. H.G. Wells Hoists the Country's Flag.*    It was Mr. H.G. Wells who at the critical moment spoke with the nation's  voice. When he uttered his electric outburst of wrath against \"this  drilling, trampling foolery in the heart of Europe\" he gave expression  to the pent-up exasperation of years of smouldering revolt against swank  and domineer, guff and bugaboo, calling itself blood and iron, and  mailed fist, and God and conscience and anything else that sounded  superb. Like Nietzsche, we were \"fed up\" with the Kaiser's imprisonments  of democratic journalists for _Majestaetsbeleidigung_ (monarch  disparagement), with his ancestors, and his mission, and his gospel of  submission and obedience for poor men, and of authority, tempered by  duelling, for rich men. The world had become sore-headed, and desired  intensely that they who clatter the sword shall perish by the sword.  Nobody cared twopence about treaties: indeed, it was not for us, who had  seen the treaty of Berlin torn up by the brazen seizure of Bosnia and  Herzegovina by Austria in 1909, and taken that lying down, as Russia  did, to talk about the sacredness of treaties, even if the wastepaper  baskets of the Foreign Offices were not full of torn up \"scraps of  paper,\" and a very good thing too; for General von Bernhardi's  assumption that circumstances alter treaties is not a page from  Machiavelli: it is a platitude from the law books. The man in the street  understood little or nothing about Servia or Russia or any of the cards  with which the diplomatists were playing their perpetual game of Beggar  my Neighbour. We were rasped beyond endurance by Prussian Militarism and  its contempt for us and for human happiness and common sense; and we  just rose at it and went for it. We have set out to smash the Kaiser  exactly as we set out to smash the Mahdi. Mr. Wells never mentioned a  treaty. He said, in effect: \"There stands the monster all freedom-loving  men hate; and at last we are going to fight it.\" And the public, bored  by the diplomatists, said: \"Now you're talking!\" We did not stop to ask  our consciences whether the Prussian assumption that the dominion of the  civilized earth belongs to German culture is really any more bumptious  than the English assumption that the dominion of the sea belongs to  British commerce. And in our island security we were as little able as  ever to realize the terrible military danger of Germany's geographical  position between France and England on her west flank and Russia on her  east: all three leagued for her destruction; and how unreasonable it was  to ask Germany to lose the fraction of a second (much less Sir Maurice  de Runsen's naive \"a few days' delay\") in dashing at her Western foe  when she could obtain no pledge as to Western intentions. \"We are now in  a state of necessity; and Necessity knows no law,\" said the Imperial  Chancellor in the Reichstag. \"It is a matter of life and death to us,\"  said the German Minister for Foreign Affairs to our Ambassador in  Berlin, who had suddenly developed an extraordinary sense of the  sacredness of the Treaty of London, dated 1839, and still, as it  happened, inviolate among the torn fragments of many subsequent and  similar \"scraps of paper.\" Our Ambassador seems to have been of Sir  Maurice's opinion that there could be no such tearing hurry. The Germans  could enter France through the line of forts between Verdun and Toul if  they were really too flustered to wait a few days on the chance of Sir  Edward Grey's persuasive conversation and charming character softening  Russia and bringing Austria to conviction of sin. Thereupon the Imperial  Chancellor, not being quite an angel, asked whether we had counted the  cost of crossing the path of an Empire fighting for its life (for these  Militarist statesmen do really believe that nations can be killed by  cannon shot). That was a threat; and as we cared nothing about Germany's  peril, and wouldn't stand being threatened any more by a Power of which  we now had the inside grip, the fat remained in the fire, blazing more  fiercely than ever. There was only one end possible to such a clash of  high tempers, national egotisms, and reciprocal ignorances.      *Delicate Position of Mr. Asquith.*    It seemed a splendid chance for the Government to place itself at the  head of the nation. But no British Government within my recollection has  ever understood the nation. Mr. Asquith, true to the Gladstonian  tradition (hardly just to Gladstone, by the way) that a Liberal Prime  Minister should know nothing concerning foreign politics and care less,  and calmly insensible to the real nature of the popular explosion, fell  back on 1839, picking up the obvious barrister's point about the  violation of the neutrality of Belgium, and tried the equally obvious  barrister's claptrap about \"an infamous proposal\" on the jury."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#7)"],[1,"im.\"    \"Koku know him next time,\" declared the giant.    \"Why! you didn't even see him this time,\" cried Tom.    \"See him boots. See marks him boots make. Know him boots.  Waugh!\"    \"'Waugh!' yourself,\" returned Tom, shaking his head. \"You are  altogether too sure, Koku. You couldn't tell a man from his bootprints  in the mud.\"    \"Koku know,\" said the giant, just as confidently. \"Wait. Him  catch--see--show Master.\"    \"Don't you go to grabbing every stranger who comes around the house or  the works for a spy, and make me trouble. Remember now.\"    Koku nodded gravely and went away. When he met Rad suddenly in the hall  with Mr. Swift's breakfast tray, the giant said \"boo!\" and almost cost  the old colored man the loss of the tray.    \"Dat big el'phant ought to be livin' in a barn,\" declared Rad.  \"Look  at dat spear he come near runnin' me t'rough wid! If he had, yo' could  ha' driv a tipcart full o' rubbish in after it.  Lawsy me!\"    But an hour later when Tom and his father started for the offices of  the Swift Construction Company down the street, Rad and Koku were  sitting before an enormous breakfast in the back kitchen and chatting  together as companionably as ever.    The old inventor and his son arrived at the offices of the Swift  Construction Company not long ahead of Mr. Richard Bartholomew. Tom had  merely found time to read over the contract that had been jointly  prepared by Ned Newton and the firm's legal advisers, before the  railroad man came.    \"No getting out of the provisions of that paper, Tom,\" Ned had  whispered, when he saw Mr. Bartholomew coming into the outer office.  \"Is this your man?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"A sharp looking little fellow,\" commented Ned. \"But even if he were  bent on tricking us, this contract would hold him. He is solvent and so  is his road--as yet. If it has a bad name in the market that is more  because of slander by the Montagne Lewis crowd than from any real  cause. I've found that out this morning.\"    \"Faithful Nero!\" chuckled Tom. \"Aren't going to let the Swifts get  done, are you?\"    \"Not if I can help it,\" declared Ned Newton emphatically.    A clerk brought Mr. Bartholomew into the private office and he was  introduced to Newton. If he considered the financial manager of the  Swift Construction Company very young for his responsible position,  after he had read the contract he felt considerable respect for Ned  Newton.    \"You've got me here, young man, hard and fast,\" Mr. Bartholomew said.  \"If I was inclined to want to wriggle out, I see no chance of it. But I  don't. You have set forth here exactly my meaning and intent. I want  your best efforts in this matter, Mr. Swift, and if you give them to me  I'll foot the bill as agreed.\"    \"You've got me interested, I confess,\" said Tom. \"By the way, were your  friends following you when you came here this morning?\"    \"My friends?\" repeated Mr. Bartholomew, for a moment puzzled.    \"The spy that you mentioned,\" said Tom, smiling.    \"That Andy O'Malley?\" exclaimed Bartholomew. \"Haven't spotted him  today.\"    \"He spotted me last night,\" said Tom grimly, and proceeded to relate  what had happened.    \"You fooled 'em that time, young man!\" exclaimed the railroad  president, with satisfaction. \"I am convinced that Montagne Lewis is  behind it. Look out for these fellows when you get to work, Mr. Swift.  They will stop at nothing. I tell you that the fight is on between the  Hendrickton & Pas Alos and the Hendrickton & Western. I have either got  to break them or they will break me.\"    \"You seem very sure that there is a conspiracy against you, Mr.  Bartholomew,\" said the senior Swift reflectively.    \"I am sure,\" was the reply. \"And I am likewise sure that this scheme of  electrification of my road through the Pas Alos Range is the only  salvation for my railroad.\"    \"I should call it a big contract,\" Ned Newton said, thoughtfully.    \"You have said it! But it is not a visionary scheme I have in mind. You  must know--you Swifts--how successful such an electrification through  the Rockies has been made by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway.\"    \"I've looked that up,\" confessed Tom, with enthusiasm. \"That was a  great piece of work.\"    \"It is. It is. But I hope for even a greater outcome of your  experiments, Mr. Swift. Of course, I do not expect to compete with that  great road. They had millions to spend, and they spent them. Those  Baldwin-Westinghouse locomotives the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul  built in nineteen hundred and nineteen are wonderful machines. They  have got forty-two freight locomotives, fifteen passenger locomotives  and four switchers of that new type.    \"The Jandel patent that my road uses is, in some degree, the equal of  those Baldwin-Westinghouse locomotives. At least, our machines equal  the C., M. & St. P. on our level road. They can reach a mile-a-minute  gait. But when it comes to speed and pull on steep grades--Ah! that is  where they fail.\"    \"You will have to get power in the hills for your stations,\" suggested  Tom, thoughtfully.    \"I know that. I know where the power is coming from. I gathered those  waterfalls in years ago. Lewis and his crowd can't shut me off from  them. But I have got to have a speedier and more powerful type of  electric locomotive than has ever yet been built to protect the  Hendrickton & Pas Alos Railroad from any rivalry.    \"I am looking to you Swifts to give me that. I am risking this  twenty-five thousand dollars upon your succeeding. And I am offering  you the hundred thousand dollars bonus for the right to purchase the  first successful locomotives that can be built covered by your patents.  Is it plain?\"    \"It is eminently satisfactory,\" said Mr. Swift, quietly.    \"I will do my very best,\" agreed Tom, warmly. \"There isn't a thing the  matter with the agreement,\" declared Ned Newton, with confidence.  \"Gentlemen, sign on the dotted line.\"    Five minutes later the twin contracts were in force. One went into the  safe of the Swift Construction Company. The other, Mr. Richard  Bartholomew bore away with him.          Chapter VII    The Man with Big Feet      The consultation in the private office of the Swift Construction  Company after the departure of Mr. Richard Bartholomew between the two  Swifts and Ned Newton had more to do with a vision of the future than  with mere present finances.    \"I expect you know just about how you are going to work on this new  invention, Tom?\" suggested the financial manager, and Tom's chum.    \"Haven't the first idea,\" rejoined the young inventor, promptly.    \"What do you mean?\" ejaculated Ned. \"You talked just now as though you  knew all about electric locomotives.\"    \"I know a good deal about those that have been built, both under the  Jandel patent and those built for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul in  the great Philadelphia shops.    \"But when you ask me if I know how I am going to improve on those  patents so as to make my locomotive twice as speedy and quite as  powerful as those other locomotives--well, I've got to tell you flat  that I have not as yet got the first idea.\"    \"Humph!\" grumbled Ned. \"You say it coolly enough.\"    \"No use getting all heated up about it,\" returned his friend.  \"I have  got to consider the situation first. I must look over the field of  electrical invention as applied to motive power. I must study things  out.\"    \"I don't just see myself,\" Ned Newton remarked thoughtfully, \"why there  should be such a great need for the electrification of locomotives,  anyway. Those great mountain-hogs that draw most of the mountain  railroad trains are very powerful, aren't they? And they are speedy.\"    \"Locomotives that use coal or oil have been developed about as far as  they can be,\" said Mr. Swift, quietly. \"A successful electric  locomotive has many advantages over the old-time engine.\"    \"What are those advantages?\" asked the business manager, quickly. \"I  confess, I do not understand the matter, Mr. Swift.\"    \"For instance,\" proceeded the old gentleman, \"there is the coal  question alone. Coal is rising in price. It is bulky. Using electricity  as motive power for railroads will do away with fuel trains, tenders,  coal handling, water, and all that. Of course, Mr. Bartholomew will  generate his electricity from water power--the cheapest power on earth.\"    \"Humph! I've got my answer right now,\" said Ned Newton. \"If there is no  other good reason, this is sufficient.\"    \"There are plenty of others,\" drawled Tom, smiling. \"Good ones.  For  instance, heat or cold has nothing to do with the even running of an  electric locomotive. It can bore right through a snowbank--a thing a  steam engine can't do. It runs at an even speed. Really, grade should  have nothing to do with its speed.  There is a fault somewhere in the  construction of the Jandel machine or the H. & P. A. would have little  trouble with those locomotives on its grades.    \"Then, all you have to do to start an electrified locomotive is to turn  a handswitch. No stoking or water-boiling. Does away with the fireboy.  One man runs it!\"    \"Why!\" cried Ned, \"I never stopped to think of all these things.\"    \"No ashes to dump,\" went on Tom. \"No flues to clean, no boilers to  inspect, and none to wear out. And they say that on the Chicago,  Milwaukee & St. Paul, at least, their freight locomotives handle twice  the load of a steam locomotive at a greatly reduced cost.\"    \"Sounds fine. Don't wonder Mr. Bartholomew is eager to electrify his  entire tine.\"    \"On the side of passenger traffic,\" continued Tom Swift, \"the electric  locomotive is smokeless, noiseless, dirtless, and doesn't jerk the  coaches in either stopping or starting. And in addition, the electric  locomotive is much easier on track and roadbed than the old 'iron  horse' driven by steam generated either from coal or oil.\"    \"It is a great field for your talents, Tom!\" cried Ned, warmly.    \"It is a big job,\" admitted Tom, and he said this"]]]
