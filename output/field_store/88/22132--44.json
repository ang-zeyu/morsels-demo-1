Among these may be mentioned the Sciapodes, or  men whose feet were so large that when it was hot they could rest  on their backs and lie in the shade. There is a dim remembrance  of these monstrosities in Shakespeare's reference to      \"The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads     Do grow beneath their shoulders.\"    In the mythical travels of Sir John Maundeville there are illustrations  of these curious beings, one of which is here reproduced. Other  tracts of country were supposed to be inhabited by equally monstrous  animals. Illustrations of most of these were utilised to fill up  the many vacant spaces in the mediaeval maps of Asia.    One author, indeed, in his theological zeal, went much further in  modifying the conceptions of the habitable world. A Christian merchant  named Cosmas, who had journeyed to India, and was accordingly known  as COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES, wrote, about 540 A.D., a work entitled  \"Christian Topography,\" to confound what he thought to be the erroneous  views of Pagan authorities about the configuration of the world. What  especially roused his ire was the conception of the spherical form  of the earth, and of the Antipodes, or men who could stand upside  down. He drew a picture of a round ball, with four men standing  upon it, with their feet on opposite sides, and asked triumphantly  how it was possible that all four could stand upright? In answer  to those who asked him to explain how he could account for day  and night if the sun did not go round the earth, he supposed that  there was a huge mountain in the extreme north, round which the sun  moved once in every twenty-four hours. Night was when the sun was  going round the other side of the mountain. He also proved, entirely  to his own satisfaction, that the sun, instead of being greater,  was very much smaller than the earth. The earth was, according to  him, a moderately sized plane, the inhabited parts of which were  separated from the antediluvian world by the ocean, and at the  four corners of the whole were the pillars which supported the  heavens, so that the whole universe was something like a big glass  exhibition case, on the top of which was the firmament, dividing  the waters above and below it, according to the first chapter of  Genesis.    [Illustration: THE HEREFORD MAP.]    Cosmas' views, however interesting and amusing they are, were too  extreme to gain much credence or attention even from the mediaeval  monks, and we find no reference to them in the various _mappoe  mundi_ which sum up their knowledge, or rather ignorance, about the  world. One of the most remarkable of these maps exists in England  at Hereford, and the plan of it given on p. 53 will convey as much  information as to early mediaeval geography as the ordinary reader  will require. In the extreme east, _i.e._ at the top, is represented  the Terrestrial Paradise; in the centre is Jerusalem; beneath this,  the Mediterranean extends to the lower edge of the map, with its  islands very carefully particularised. Much attention is given  to the rivers throughout, but very little to the mountains. The  only real increase of actual knowledge represented in the map is  that of the north-east of Europe, which had I naturally become  better known by the invasion of the Norsemen. But how little real  knowledge was possessed of this portion of Europe is proved by  the fact that the mapmaker placed near Norway the Cynocephali, or  dog-headed men, probably derived from some confused accounts of  Indian monkeys. Near them are placed the Gryphons, \"men most wicked,  for among their misdeeds they also make garments for themselves and  their horses out of the skins of their enemies.\" Here, too, is  placed the home of the Seven Sleepers, who lived for ever as a  standing miracle to convert the heathen. The shape given to the  British Islands will be observed as due to the necessity of keeping  the circular form of the inhabited world. Other details about England  we may leave for the present.    It is obvious that maps such as the Hereford one would be of no  practical utility to travellers who desired to pass from one country  to another; indeed, they were not intended for any such purpose.  Geography had ceased to be in any sense a practical science; it  only ministered to men's sense of wonder, and men studied it mainly  in order to learn about the marvels of the world. When William  of Wykeham drew up his rules for the Fellows and Scholars of New  College, Oxford, he directed them in the long winter evenings to  occupy themselves with \"singing, or reciting poetry, or with the  chronicles of the different kingdoms, or with the _wonders of the  world_.\" Hence almost all mediaeval maps are filled up with pictures  of these wonders, which were the more necessary as so few people  could read. A curious survival of this custom lasted on in map-drawing  almost to the beginning of this century, when the spare places in  the ocean were adorned with pictures of sailing ships or spouting  sea monsters.    When men desired to travel, they did not use such maps as these,  but rather itineraries, or road-books, which did not profess to  give the shape of the countries through which a traveller would  pass, but only indicated the chief towns on the most-frequented  roads. This information was really derived from classical times,  for the Roman emperors from time to time directed such road-books  to be drawn up, and there still remains an almost complete itinerary  of the Empire, known as the Peutinger Table, from the name of the  German merchant who first drew the attention of the learned world  to it. A condensed reproduction is given on the following page,  from which it will be seen that no attempt is made to give anything  more than the roads and towns. Unfortunately, the first section of  the table, which started from Britain, has been mutilated, and we  only get the Kentish coast. These itineraries were specially useful,  as the chief journeys of men were in the nature of pilgrimages; but  these often included a sort of commercial travelling, pilgrims  often combining business and religion on their journeys. The chief  information about Eastern Europe which reached the West was given  by the succession of pilgrims who visited Palestine up to the time  of the Crusades. Our chief knowledge of the geography of Europe  daring the five centuries between 500 and 1000 A.D. is given in  the reports of successive pilgrims.    [Illustration: THE PEUTINGER TABLE--WESTERN PART.]    This period may be regarded as the Dark Age of geographical knowledge,  during which wild conceptions like those contained in the Hereford  map were substituted for the more accurate measurements of the  ancients. Curiously enough, almost down to the time of Columbus  the learned kept to these conceptions, instead of modifying them by  the extra knowledge gained during the second period of the Middle  Ages, when travellers of all kinds obtained much fuller information  of Asia, North Europe, and even, as, we shall see, of some parts  of America.    It is not altogether surprising that this period should have been  so backward in geographical knowledge, since the map of Europe  itself, in its political divisions, was entirely readjusted during  this period. The thousand years of history which elapsed between 450  and 1450 were practically taken up by successive waves of invasion  from the centre of Asia, which almost entirely broke up the older  divisions of the world.    In the fifth century three wandering tribes, invaded the Empire, from  the banks of the Vistula, the Dnieper, and the Volga respectively. The  Huns came from the Volga, in the extreme east, and under Attila, \"the  Hammer of God,\" wrought consternation in the Empire; the Visigoths,  from the Dnieper, attacked the Eastern Empire; while the Vandals,  from the Vistula, took a triumphant course through Gaul and Spain,  and founded for a time a Vandal empire in North Africa. One of the  consequences of this movement was to drive several of the German  tribes into France, Italy, and Spain, and even over into Britain;  for it is from this stage in the world's history that we can trace  the beginning of England, properly so called, just as the invasion  of Gaul by the Franks at this time means the beginning of French  history. By the eighth century the kingdom of the Franks extended  all over France, and included most of Central Germany; while on  Christmas Day, 800, Charles the Great was crowned at Rome, by the  Pope, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, which professed to revive  the glories of the old empire, but made a division between the  temporal power held by the Emperor and the spiritual power held  by the Pope.    One of the divisions of the Frankish Empire deserves attention,  because upon its fate rested the destinies of most of the nations  of Western Europe. The kingdom of Burgundy, the buffer state between  France and Germany, has now entirely disappeared, except as the  name of a wine; but having no natural boundaries, it was disputed  between France and Germany for a long period, and it may be fairly  said that the Franco-Prussian War was the last stage in its history  up to the present. A similar state existed in the east of Europe,  viz. the kingdom of Poland, which was equally indefinite in shape,  and has equally formed a subject of dispute between the nations  of Eastern Europe. This, as is well known, only disappeared as  an independent state in 1795, when it finally ceased to act as a  buffer between Russia and the rest of Europe. Roughly speaking,  after the settlement of the Germanic tribes within the confines of  the Empire, the history of Europe, and therefore its historical  geography, may be summed up as a struggle for the possession of  Burgundy and Poland.    But there was an important interlude in the south-west of Europe,  which must engage our attention as a symptom"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#7)"],[1,", to mix       the curds at the time of milling, as a more distinct color is       secured. After milling, the sage extract flavoring is sprayed       over the curd with an atomizer. The curd is then salted and       pressed into the regular Cheddar shapes and sizes.         A very satisfactory Sage cheese is made at the New York State       College of Agriculture by simply dropping green coloring, made       from the leaves of corn and spinach, upon the curd, after       milling. An even green mottling is thus easily secured without       additional labor. Sage flavoring extract is sprayed over the curd       by an atomizer. One-half ounce of flavoring is usually sufficient       for a hundred pounds of curd and can be secured from dairy supply       houses.    A modern cheese authority reported on the current (1953) method:         Instead of sage leaves, or tea prepared from them, at present the       cheese is flavored with oil of Dalmatian wild sage because it has       the sharpest flavor. This piny oil, thujone, is diluted with       water, 250 parts to one, and either added to the milk or sprayed       over the curds, one-eighth ounce for 500 quarts of milk.    In scouting around for a possible maker of the real thing today, we  wrote to Vrest Orton of Vermont, and got this reply:         Sage cheese is one of the really indigenous and best native       Vermont products. So far as I know, there is only one factory       making it and that is my friend, George Crowley's. He makes a       limited amount for my Vermont Country Store. It is the fine       old-time full cream cheese, flavored with real sage.         On this hangs a tale. Some years ago I couldn't get enough sage       cheese (we never can) so I asked a Wisconsin cheesemaker if he       would make some. Said he would but couldn't at that time--because       the alfalfa wasn't ripe. I said, \"What in hell has alfalfa got to       do with sage cheese?\" He said, \"Well, we flavor the sage cheese       with a synthetic sage flavor and then throw in some pieces of       chopped-up alfalfa to make it look green.\"         So I said to hell with that and the next time I saw George       Crowley I told him the story and George said, \"We don't use       synthetic flavor, alfalfa or anything like that.\"         \"Then what do you use, George?\" I inquired.         \"We use real sage.\"         \"Why?\"         \"Well, because it's cheaper than that synthetic stuff.\"    The genuine Vermont Sage arrived. Here are our notes on it:         Oh, wilderness were Paradise enow! My taste buds come to full       flower with the Sage. There's a slight burned savor recalling       smoked cheese, although not related in any way. Mildly resinous       like that Near East one packed in pine, suggesting the well-saged       dressing of a turkey. A round mouthful of luscious mellowness,       with a bouquet--a snapping reminder to the nose. And there's just       a soupcon of new-mown hay above the green freckles of herb to       delight the eye and set the fancy free. So this is the _veritable       vert_, green cheese--the moon is made of it! _Vert veritable._ A       general favorite with everybody who ever tasted it, for       generations of lusty crumblers.      Old-Fashioned Vermont State Store Cheese    We received from savant Vrest Orton another letter, together with some  Vermont store cheese and some crackers.         This cheese is our regular old-fashioned store cheese--it's been       in old country stores for generations and we have been pioneers       in spreading the word about it. It is, of course, a natural aged       cheese, no processing, no fussing, no fooling with it. It's made       the same way it was back in 1870, by the old-time Colby method       which makes a cheese which is not so dry as Cheddar and also has       holes in it, something like Swiss. Also, it ages faster.         Did you know that during the last part of the nineteenth century       and part of the twentieth, Vermont was the leading cheesemaking       state in the Union? When I was a lad, every town in Vermont had       one or more cheese factories. Now there are only two left--not       counting any that make process. Process isn't cheese!         The crackers are the old-time store cracker--every Vermonter       used to buy a big barrel once a year to set in the buttery and       eat. A classic dish is crackers, broken up in a bowl of cold       milk, with a hunk of Vermont cheese like this on the side. Grand       snack, grand midnight supper, grand anything. These crackers are       not sweet, not salt, and as such make a good base for       anything--swell with clam chowder, also with toasted cheese....      Tillamook    It takes two pocket-sized, but thick, yellow volumes to record the  story of Oregon's great Tillamook. _The Cheddar Box_, by Dean Collins,  comes neatly boxed and bound in golden cloth stamped with a purple  title, like the rind of a real Tillamook. Volume I is entitled _Cheese  Cheddar_, and Volume II is a two-pound Cheddar cheese labeled  Tillamook and molded to fit inside its book jacket. We borrowed Volume  I from a noted _litterateur_, and never could get him to come across  with Volume II. We guessed its fate, however, from a note on the  flyleaf of the only tome available: \"This is an excellent cheese, full  cream and medium sharp, and a unique set of books in which Volume II  suggests Bacon's: 'Some books are to be tasted, others to be  swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.'\"      Wisconsin Longhorn    Since we began this chapter with all-American Cheddars, it is only  fitting to end with Wisconsin Longhorn, a sort of national standard,  even though it's not nearly so fancy or high-priced as some of the  regional natives that can't approach its enormous output. It's one of  those all-purpose round cheeses that even taste round in your mouth.  We are specially partial to it.    Most Cheddars are named after their states. Yet, putting all of these  thirty-seven states together, they produce only about half as much as  Wisconsin alone.    Besides Longhorn, in Wisconsin there are a dozen regional competitors  ranging from White Twin Cheddar, to which no annatto coloring has been  added, through Green Bay cheese to Wisconsin Redskin and Martha  Washington Aged, proudly set forth by P.H. Kasper of Bear Creek, who  is said to have \"won more prizes in forty years than any ten  cheesemakers put together.\"    To help guarantee a market for all this excellent apple-pie cheese,  the Wisconsin State Legislature made a law about it, recognizing the  truth of Eugene Field's jingle:        Apple pie without cheese      Is like a kiss without a squeeze.    Small matter in the Badger State when the affinity is made legal and  the couple lawfully wedded in Statute No. 160,065. It's still in  force:         _Butter and cheese to be served._ Every person, firm or       corporation duly licensed to operate a hotel or restaurant shall       serve with each meal for which a charge of twenty-five cents or       more is made, at least two-thirds of an ounce of Wisconsin butter       and two-thirds of an ounce of Wisconsin cheese.    Besides Longhorn, Wisconsin leads in Limburger. It produces so much  Swiss that the state is sometimes called Swissconsin.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Five_    Sixty-five Sizzling Rabbits           That nice little smoky room at the \"Salutation,\" which is even       now continually presenting itself to my recollection, with all       its associated train of pipes, egg-hot, welsh-rabbits,       metaphysics and poetry.         Charles Lamb, IN A LETTER TO COLERIDGE      Unlike the beginning of the classical Jugged Hare recipe: \"First catch  your hare!\" we modern Rabbit-hunters start off with \"First catch your  Cheddar!\" And some of us go so far as to smuggle in formerly forbidden  _fromages_ such as Gruyere, Neufchatel, Parmesan, and mixtures  thereof. We run the gamut of personal preferences in selecting the  Rabbit cheese itself, from old-time American, yellow or store cheese,  to Coon and Canadian-smoked, though all of it is still Cheddar, no  matter how you slice it.    Then, too, guests are made to run the gauntlet of all-American  trimmings from pin-money pickles to peanut butter, succotash and maybe  marshmallows; we add mustard, chill, curry, tabasco and sundry bottled  red devils from the grocery store, to add pep and piquance to the  traditional cayenne and black pepper. This results in Rabbits that are  out of focus, out of order and out of this world.    Among modern sins of omission, the Worcestershire sauce is left out by  braggarts who aver that they can take it or leave it. And, in these  degenerate days, when it comes to substitutions for the original beer  or stale pale ale, we find the gratings of great Cheddars wet down  with mere California sherry or even ginger ale--yet so far, thank  goodness, no Cokes. And there's tomato juice out of a can into the Rum  Turn Tiddy, and sometimes celery soup in place of milk or cream.    In view of all this, we can only look to the standard cookbooks for  salvation. These are mostly compiled by women, our thoughtful mothers,  wives and sweethearts who have saved the twin Basic Rabbits for us. If  it weren't for these Fanny Farmers, the making of a real aboriginal  Welsh Rabbit would be a lost art--lost in sporting male attempts to  improve upon the original.    The girls are still polite about the whole thing and protectively  pervert the original spelling of \"Rabbit\" to \"Rarebit\" in their  culinary guides. We have heard that once a club of ladies in high  society tried to high-pressure the publishers of Mr. Webster's  dictionary to change the old spelling in their favor. Yet there is a  lot to be said for this more genteel and appetizing rendering of the  word, for the Welsh masterpiece is, after all, a very rare bit of  cheesemongery, male or female.    Yet in dealing with \""]]]
