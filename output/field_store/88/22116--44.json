[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13937"],[0,"The Mysterious Rider (#7)"],[1,"my head at sight of you.\"    Columbine looked up at him and was reminded of how, as a boy, he had  always taken a quick, passionate longing for things he must and would  have. And his father had not denied him. It might really be that Jack  had suddenly fallen in love with her.    \"Would you want to take me without my--my love?\" she asked, very low. \"I  don't love you now. I might some time, if you were good--if you made dad  happy--if you conquered--\"    \"Take you! I'd take you if you--if you hated me,\" he replied, now in the  grip of passion.    \"I'll tell dad how I feel,\" she said, faintly, \"and--and marry you when  he says.\"    He kissed her, would have embraced her had she not put him back.    \"Don't! Some--some one will see.\"    \"Columbine, we're engaged,\" he asserted, with a laugh of possession.  \"Say, you needn't look so white and scared. I won't eat you. But I'd  like to.... Oh, you're a sweet girl! Here I was hating to come home. And  look at my luck!\"    Then with a sudden change, that seemed significant of his character, he  lost his ardor, dropped the half-bold, half-masterful air, and showed  the softer side.    \"Collie, I never was any good,\" he said. \"But I want to be better. I'll  prove it. I'll make a clean breast of everything. I won't marry you with  any secret between us. You might find out afterward and hate me.... Do  you have any idea where I've been these last three years?\"    \"No,\" answered Columbine.    \"I'll tell you right now. But you must promise never to mention it to  any one--or throw it up to me--ever.\"    He spoke hoarsely, and had grown quite white. Suddenly Columbine thought  of Wilson Moore! He had known where Jack had spent those years. He had  resisted a strong temptation to tell her. That was as noble in him as  the implication of Jack's whereabouts had been base.    \"Jack, that is big of you,\" she replied, hurriedly. \"I respect you--like  you for it. But you needn't tell me. I'd rather you didn't. I'll take  the will for the deed.\"    Belllounds evidently experienced a poignant shock of amaze, of relief,  of wonder, of gratitude. In an instant he seemed transformed.    \"Collie, if I hadn't loved you before I'd love you now. That was going  to be the hardest job I ever had--to tell you my--my story. I meant it.  And now I'll not have to feel your shame for me and I'll not feel I'm a  cheat or a liar.... But I will tell you this--if you love me you'll make  a man of me!\"        CHAPTER III    The rancher thought it best to wait till after the round-up before he  turned over the foremanship to his son. This was wise, but Jack did not  see it that way. He showed that his old, intolerant spirit had, if  anything, grown during his absence. Belllounds patiently argued with  him, explaining what certainly should have been clear to a young man  brought up in Colorado. The fall round-up was the most important time of  the year, and during the strenuous drive the appointed foreman should  have absolute control. Jack gave in finally with a bad grace.    It was unfortunate that he went directly from his father's presence out  to the corrals. Some of the cowboys who had ridden all the day before  and stood guard all night had just come in. They were begrimed with  dust, weary, and sleepy-eyed.    \"This hyar outfit won't see my tracks no more,\" said one, disgustedly.  \"I never kicked on doin' two men's work. But when it comes to rustlin'  day and night, all the time, I'm a-goin' to pass.\"    \"Turn in, boys, and sleep till we get back with the chuck-wagon,\" said  Wilson Moore. \"We'll clean up that bunch to-day.\"    \"Ain't you tired, Wils?\" queried Bludsoe, a squat, bow-legged cowpuncher  who appeared to be crippled or very lame.    \"Me? Naw!\" grunted Moore, derisively. \"Blud, you sure ask fool  questions.... Why, you--mahogany-colored, stump-legged, biped of a  cowpuncher, I've had three hours' sleep in four nights!\"    \"What's a biped?\" asked Bludsoe, dubiously.    Nobody enlightened him.    \"Wils, you-all air the only eddicated cowman I ever loved, but I'm a  son-of-a-gun if we ain't agoin' to come to blows some day,\"  declared Bludsoe.    \"He shore can sling English,\" drawled Lem Billings. \"I reckon he  swallowed a dictionary onct.\"    \"Wal, he can sling a rope, too, an' thet evens up,\" added Jim Montana.    Just at this moment Jack Belllounds appeared upon the scene. The cowboys  took no notice of him. Jim was bandaging a leg of his horse; Bludsoe was  wearily gathering up his saddle and trappings; Lem was giving his tired  mustang a parting slap that meant much. Moore evidently awaited a fresh  mount. A Mexican lad had come in out of the pasture leading several  horses, one of which was the mottled white mustang that Moore rode most  of the time.    Belllounds lounged forward with interest as Moore whistled, and the  mustang showed his pleasure. Manifestly he did not like the Mexican boy  and he did like Moore.    \"Spottie, it's drag yearlings around for you to-day,\" said the cowboy,  as he caught the mustang. Spottie tossed his head and stepped high until  the bridle was on. When the saddle was thrown and strapped in place the  mustang showed to advantage. He was beautiful, but not too graceful or  sleek or fine-pointed or prancing to prejudice any cowboy against his  qualities for work.    Jack Belllounds admiringly walked all around the mustang a little too  close to please Spottie.    \"Moore, he's a fair-to-middling horse,\" said Belllounds, with the air of  judge of horseflesh. \"What's his name?\"    \"Spottie,\" replied Moore, shortly, as he made ready to mount.    \"Hold on, will you!\" ordered Jack, peremptorily. \"I like this horse. I  want to look him over.\"    When he grasped the bridle-reins out of the cowboy's hand Spottie jumped  as if he had been shot at. Belllounds jerked at him and went closer. The  mustang reared, snorting, plunging to get loose. Then Jack Belllounds  showed the sudden temper for which he was noted. Red stained his  pale cheeks.    \"Damn you--come down!\" he shouted, infuriated at the mustang, and with  both hands he gave a powerful lunge. Spottie came down, and stood there,  trembling all over, his ears laid back, his eyes showing fright and  pain. Blood dripped from his mouth where the bit had cut him.    \"I'll teach you to stand,\" said Belllounds, darkly. \"Moore, lend me your  spurs. I want to try him out.\"    \"I don't lend my spurs--or my horse, either,\" replied the cowboy,  quietly, with a stride that put him within reach of Spottie.    The other cowboys had dropped their trappings and stood at attention,  with intent gaze and mute lips.    \"Is he your horse?\" demanded Jack, with a quick flush.    \"I reckon so,\" replied Moore, slowly. \"No one but me ever rode him.\"    \"Does my father own him or do you own him?\"    \"Well, if that's the way you figure--he belongs to White Slides,\"  returned the cowboy. \"I never bought him. I only raised him from a colt,  broke him, and rode him.\"    \"I thought so. Moore, he's mine, and I'm going to ride him now. Lend me  spurs, one of you cowpunchers.\"    Nobody made any motion to comply. There seemed to be a suspense at hand  that escaped Belllounds.    \"I'll ride him without spurs,\" he declared, presently, and again he  turned to mount the mustang.    \"Belllounds, it'd be better for you not to ride him now,\" said Moore,  coolly.    \"Why, I'd like to know?\" demanded Belllounds, with the temper of one who  did not tolerate opposition.    \"He's the only horse left for me to ride,\" answered the cowboy. \"We're  branding to-day. Hudson was hurt yesterday. He was foreman, and he  appointed me to fill his place. I've got to rope yearlings. Now, if you  get up on Spottie you'll excite him. He's high-strung, nervous. That'll  be bad for him, as he hates cutting-out and roping.\"    The reasonableness of this argument was lost upon Belllounds.    \"Moore, maybe it'd interest you to know that I'm foreman of White  Slides,\" he asserted, not without loftiness.    His speech manifestly decided something vital for the cowboy.    \"Ahuh!... I'm sure interested this minute,\" replied Moore, and then,  stepping to the side of the mustang, with swift hands he unbuckled the  cinch, and with one sweep he drew saddle and blanket to the ground.    The action surprised Belllounds. He stared. There seemed something  boyish in his lack of comprehension. Then his temper flamed.    \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded, with a strident note in his  voice. \"Put that saddle back.\"    \"Not much. It's my saddle. Cost sixty dollars at Kremmling last year.  Good old hard-earned saddle!... And you can't ride it. Savvy?\"    \"Yes, I savvy,\" replied Belllounds, violently. \"Now you'll savvy what I  say. I'll have you discharged.\"    \"Nope. Too late,\" said Moore, with cool, easy scorn. \"I figured that.  And I quit a minute ago--when you showed what little regard you had  for a horse.\"    \"You quit!... Well, it's damned good riddance. I wouldn't have you in  the outfit.\"    \"You couldn't have kept me, Buster Jack.\"    The epithet must have been an insult to Belllounds. \"Don't you dare call  me that,\" he burst out, furiously.    Moore pretended surprise. \"Why not? It's your range name. We all get a  handle, whether we like it or not. There's Montana and Blud and Lemme  Two Bits. They call me Professor. Why should you kick on yours?\"    \"I won't stand it now. Not from any one--especially not you.\"    \"Ahuh! Well, I'm afraid it'll stick,\" replied Moore, with sarcasm. \"It  sure suits you. Don't you bust everything you monkey with? Your old dad  will sure be glad to see you bust the round-up to-day--and I reckon the  outfit to-morrow.\"    \"You insolent cowpuncher!\" shouted Belllounds, growing beside himself  with rage. \"If you don't shut up I'll bust your face.\"    \"Shut up!... Me? Nope. It can't be did. This is a free country, Buster  Jack.\" There was no denying Moore's cool, stinging repetition of the  epithet that had so affronted Belllounds.    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13941"],[0,"The Divine Right of Church Government (#7)"],[1,"polity of the Church,  say some.[6] Of the kingdom of grace, say others.[7] Judicious  Calvin[8] interprets it partly of church government, saying, Luke  admonisheth us, that Christ did not so depart out of the world, as to  cast off all care of us: for by this doctrine he shows that he hath  constituted a perpetual government in his Church. Therefore Luke  signifies, that Christ departed not, before he had provided for his  Church's government. Now those expressions are set in the frontispiece,  to stamp the greater authority and obligatory power upon the acts after  recorded, being done according to Christ's commandments; Christ  intending their acts in the first founding of his kingdom and polity  ecclesiastic to be the rule for after churches. For what Christ spoke of  his kingdom to the apostles is like that, \"What I say to you, I say to  all,\" Matt. xiii. 37, as what was said to the apostles touching  preaching and baptizing, remitting and retaining of sins, was said to  all the apostles' successors, \"to the end of the world,\" John xx. 21,  23, with Matt, xxviii. 18-20.    2. By God's approving and commending such as were followers not only of  the doctrine, but also of the examples of the Lord, his apostles, and  primitive churches; \"And ye became followers\" (or imitators) \"of us and  of the Lord,\" 1 Thess. i. 6, 7; and again, \"Ye, brethren, became  followers\" (or imitators) \"of the churches of God, which in Judea are in  Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own  countrymen, even as they have of the Jews,\" 1 Thess. ii. 14. In which  places the Holy Ghost recites the Thessalonians imitating of the Lord,  of the apostles, and of the churches, to the praise of the  Thessalonians, by which they are given to understand that they did well,  and discharged their duty in such imitations: for God's condemning or  commending any thing, is virtually a prohibiting or prescribing thereof.    3. By the Lord's commanding some examples to be imitated. Commands of  this nature are frequent. In general, \"Beloved, imitate not that which  is evil, but that which is good,\" 3 John 11. In particular, 1. Imitating  of God and Christ; \"Be ye, therefore, followers of God as dear children:  and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us,\" Eph. v. 1, 2, with Eph.  iv. 32. \"He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also to walk,  even as he walked,\" 1 John ii. 6. 2. Imitating the apostles and other  saints of God. \"I beseech you, be ye imitators of me: for this cause  have I sent unto you Timothy--who shall bring you into remembrance of my  ways which be in Christ,\" 1 Cor. iv. 16, 17. \"Be ye imitators of me,  even as I also am of Christ,\" 1 Cor. xi. 1.    \"Those things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and  seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you,\" Phil. iv. 9.  \"Be not slothful, but imitators of them who through faith and patience  inherit the promises,\" Heb. vi. 12. \"Whose faith imitate, considering  the end of their conversation,\" Heb. xiii. 7. \"Take, my brethren, the  prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example\" (or  pattern) \"of suffering affliction, and of patience,\" James v. 10. These  and like divine commands infallibly evidence that many scripture  examples are obligatory, and do bind our consciences to the imitation of  them.    4. By consent of orthodox and learned writers, both ancient and modern,  acknowledging an obligatory force in some scripture examples, as being  left upon record for our imitation. As among others Chrysostom,[9] and  Greg. Nyssen[10] well observe.    Among modern writers, Mr. Perkins excellently observes, This is a rule  in divinity, that the ordinary examples of the godly approved in  Scripture, being against no general precept, have the force of a general  rule, and are to be followed. See also Pet. Martyr, Calvin, and  others.[11]    II. Thus, it is clear that some scripture examples are obligatory. Now  (to come closer to the matter) consider which scripture examples are  obligatory. 1. How many sorts of binding examples are propounded to us  in Scripture. 2. What rules we may walk by for finding out the  obligatory force of such examples.    How many sorts of binding examples are propounded unto us in Scripture,  and which are those examples? Ans. There are principally three sorts,  viz: Examples of God, of Christ, of Christians.    I. Of God. The example of God is propounded in Scripture as obligatory  on us in all moral excellencies and actions: e.g. Matt. v. 44, 45, 48;  Eph. v. 1; 1 Pet. i. 14-16; 1 John iv. 10, 11.    II. Of Christ. That the example of Christ is obligatory, and a binding  rule to us for imitation, is evident by these and like testimonies of  Scripture, Matt. xi. 29; 1 Cor. xi. 11; Eph. v. 2, 3, 25, &c.; 1 John  ii. 6; 1 Pet. ii. 21-23. \"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed  your feet, ye ought also to wash one another's feet. For I have given  you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you,\" John xiii. 14,  15. In this place we must follow the reason of the example, rather than  the individual act, viz: after Christ's example, we must be ready to  perform the lowest and meanest offices of love and service to one  another.    But which of Christ's examples are obligatory on Christians, will better  appear, by distinguishing the several sorts of Christ's actions.  Christ's actions were of several kinds; and to imitate them all is  neither needful, nor possible, nor warrantable. Orthodox writers thus  rank Christ's actions:    1. Some of Christ's actions were of divine power and virtue; as his  miracles, turning water into wine, John ii. 7, &c.; walking on the sea,  Mark vi. 48, 49; dispossessing of devils by his word, Mark i. 27; Luke  iv. 36; curing one born blind with clay and spittle, John ix.; healing  the sick by his word or touch, John iv. 50; Mark vi. 56; raising the  dead to life again, as John xii. 1; Matt. xi. 5; Luke vii. 22.    2. Some were acts of divine prerogative, as sending for the ass and  colt, without first asking the owner's leave, Matt. xxi. 2, &c.    3. Some mediatory, done by him as Mediator, Prophet, Priest, and King of  his Church: e.g. inditing the Scripture, called therefore the word of  Christ, Col. iii. 16; laying down his life _for the sheep_, John x. 15,  &c.; giving of the Spirit, John xx. 22; Acts ii.; appointing of his own  officers, and giving them commissions, Eph. iv. 7, 10, 11; Matt. x. and  xxviii. 18-20; instituting of new, and thereby abrogating of old  ordinances, Matt. xxviii. 18, 19; 1 Cor. xi. 23, &c.    4. Some accidental, occasional, incidental, or circumstantial, as in  the case of his celebrating his supper, that it was at night, not in the  morning; after supper, not before; with none but men, none but  ministers; with unleavened, not with leavened bread, &c.; these  circumstantials were accidentally occasioned by the passover, nature of  his family, &c.    5. Some acts of Christ were moral, as Matt. xi. 29; Eph. v. 2, 3, 25,  &c.; or at least founded upon a moral reason and foundation, as John  xiii. 14,15.    To imitate Christ in his three first sort of acts, is utterly unlawful,  and in part impossible. To imitate him in his circumstantial acts from  necessity, were to make accidentals necessary, and happily to border  upon superstition; for, to urge any thing above what is appointed, as  absolutely necessary, is to urge superstition; and to yield to any thing  above what is appointed, as simply necessary, were to yield to  superstition. But to imitate Christ in his moral acts, or acts grounded  upon a moral reason, is our duty: such acts of Christ ought to be the  Christian's rules.    III. Of prophets, apostles, saints, or primitive churches. That their  examples are obligatory, is evident by these places, 1 Cor. xi. 1; Phil.  iv. 8, 9; 1 Pet. iii. 4, 5, 6; 1 Thess. i. 6, and ii. 14; Heb. xiii. 7;  James v. 10, 11; 3 John 11.    Which of their examples are obligatory, may be thus resolved, by  distinguishing of their actions.    1. Some were sinful; written for our caution and admonition, not for our  imitation: as 1 Cor. x. 5, 6, 10, 12. That neither the just be lifted up  into pride by security, nor the unjust be hardened against the medicine  through despair. See the fourth rule following.    2. Some were heroical; done by singular instinct and instigation of the  Spirit of God; as divers acts may be presumed to be, (though we read not  the instinct clearly recorded:) as, Elias's calling for fire from  heaven, 2 Kings i. 10; which the very apostles might not imitate, not  having his spirit, Luke ix. 54, 55; Phinehas's killing the adulterer and  adulteress, Numb. xxv. 7, 8; Samson's avenging himself upon his enemies  by his own death, Judges xvi. 30, of which, saith Bernard, if it be  defended not to have been his sin, it is undoubtedly to be believed he  had private counsel, viz. from God, for his fact; David's fighting with  Goliath of Gath the giant, hand to hand, 1 Sam. xvii. 32, &c., which is  no warrant for private duels and quarrels. Such heroic acts are not  imitable but by men furnished with like heroic spirit, and instinct  divine.    3. Some were by special calling, and singular extraordinary  dispensation: as Abraham's call to leave his own country for pilgrimage  in Canaan, Gen. xii. 1, 4, which is no warrant for popish pilgrimages  to the holy land, &c.; Abraham's attempts, upon God's special trying  commands, to kill and sacrifice his son, Gen. xxii. 10, no warrant for  parents to kill or sacrifice their children; the Israelites borrowing  of, and robbing the Egyptians, Exod. xii. 35, no warrant for cozenage,  stealing, or for borrowing with intent not to pay again: compare Rom.  xiii. 8; 1 Thess. iv. 6; Psal. xxxvii. 21; the Israelites taking usury  of the Canaanitish strangers, (who were destined to ruin both in their  states and persons, Deut. xx. 15-17,) Deut. xxiii. 20, which justifies"]]]
