At the time Juan de Oliver  was preaching in that district, and it is exceedingly probable that  he helped the newcomers with the language, for Chirino speaks of him  in terms of highest praise. Henriquez \"learned the language in three  months and in six wrote a catechism in it, a confessionary, and a  book of sermons for all the gospels of the year in the said idiom,\"  [93] but he died on February 3, 1593 at Taytay. How thoroughly Chirino  himself had grasped the fundamentals of Tagalog is evident from his  three chapters [94] on the language and letters of the natives in  which he prints the Ave Maria in Tagalog and reproduces the Tagalog  alphabet--its first appearance in a European publication. But Chirino,  who remained in the provinces until 1595, would have mentioned his  participation and that of Henriquez in the Doctrina of 1593, so we  record them as possible but not probable consultants.        THE DOMINICANS      Had Aduarte written that the first books printed at Manila were two  Doctrinas issued by the Dominicans at San Gabriel in 1593, and given  some details of their production, we could conclude our study with  a quotation from him, but nowhere does he mention them. In fact,  his inference was that the first book was that printed for Blancas  de San Jose, and yet we know that this Doctrina preceded anything  that Blancas de San Jose could have written, since he did not come  to the Philippines until 1595. We can assume, as Retana did, that  by printing Aduarte meant printing from movable type, but this does  not explain away the fact that Aduarte, who recorded in detail events  of far less significance, did not speak of the Doctrinas at all. The  best--and it is a most unsatisfactory best--that we can do is ascribe  the omission to the frailty of man, and record that there is no notice  of the Dominican Doctrina of 1593 in the most complete contemporary  Dominican history of the Philippines.    The first members of the Order of St. Dominic [95] to land in the  Philippines were Bishop Salazar and his assistant, Christoval de  Salvatierra. But they were fully occupied with the administration of  the bishopric and could not devote themselves to regular missionary  work. It was not until July 25, 1587 that working Dominican  missionaries came. Then fifteen [96] under the leadership of Juan de  Castro arrived, and established the first Dominican province [97]  of the Philippines and China, thus consummating the hope expressed  as early as 1579. [98]    In consultation with the other orders it was decided that the  Dominicans should be given the ministry of the territories of  Pangasinan and Bataan, which had theretofore been spiritually  exploited by few priests. Almost immediately, on September 15, 1587,  the vicariate of Bataan was founded and settled. In speaking of it,  Aduarte stressed the importance of a knowledge of the language of the  natives, which there would have been Tagalog, to the success of the  mission. Domingo de Nieva, one of the four members of the mission,  learned it rapidly and well, and soon began to preach to the Indians  in their own tongue. His aptitude for languages and its usefulness to  the Dominicans must have been very great, for Aduarte in listing the  priests who originally volunteered in Spain makes few comments about  individuals, but of Nieva he remarks that he \"was afterwards of great  importance because of the great ease and skill with which he learned  languages, whether Indian or Chinese.\" [99] Unfortunately Nieva was  only a deacon, and so could not hear confession, a fact which was  greatly deplored, because during that first year no other priest  mastered the language sufficiently well to do it, but in September  1588 he reached the requisite age and was ordained. About that time  the friars in Bataan--one had died and another was ailing--were joined  by Juan de la Cruz, \"who, being young, succeeded very well with the  language,\" [100] and also succeeded in surviving the climate.    Early in 1588 Juan Cobo [101] arrived from Mexico. Shortly thereafter,  on June 12, 1588, the Dominican chapter held its first convocation. It  elected Juan de Castro the first provincial, adopted the general  ordinances [102] already made in Mexico, gave the convent at Manila  the title of priory, and designated as parts of the province four  vicariates. Of primary importance was the appointment then of Juan  Cobo to the mission for the Chinese.    From the very earliest days of the Spanish occupation of Manila,  the governors had had trouble with the Chinese and Sangleys. [103]  These people had long conducted a profitable trade between China  and the Philippines, and many had settled permanently near Manila,  while others stayed there regularly between trading voyages. The  Chinese merchants were in full control of the shops of the city, and  so monopolized retail trade that the early governors legislated [104]  against them to give the Spaniards a chance to establish themselves  in business. In 1588 there were as many as seven thousand of them in  and around Manila.    No one had objected to the Pangasinan and Bataan assignments, but when  it was suggested that the Dominicans also assume the responsibility for  the ministry over the Chinese and Sangleys in the suburbs of Manila,  the Augustinians vehemently resented what they considered an invasion  of their prior rights. Aduarte omits any account of a disagreement,  merely saying that since the Chinese had had no one to minister to  them the Dominicans assumed that responsibility, but in a letter [105]  from the Licentiate Gaspar de Ayala to Philip II, dated from Manila,  July 15, 1589, full details of the squabble are given. From this source  we learn that the Augustinians had a convent in the village of Tondo  in the Chinese district. There they had ministered to the natives in  their own language, but had rather neglected their Chinese-speaking  parishioners. Consequently after the arrival of the Dominicans the  Audiencia passed an ordinance requiring that the Bishop appoint  ministers of one order to administer to the Chinese in their own  language within thirty days. To meet the deadline the Augustinians  began to study Chinese at breakneck speed, but when the Bishop came  to Tondo to hear one of the friars, who was supposed to know the  language, preach in it, there was some trouble as a result of which  the Augustinian would not, or indeed could not, preach. Naturally,  when it was decided to award the territory to the Dominicans, the  Augustinians accused the Bishop of favoritism towards his own order.    The whole situation is best described in the report on the Chinese  made by Salazar to the King on June 24, 1590:          \"When I arrived in this land, I found that in a village called      Tondo--which is not far from this city, there being a river      between--lived many Sangleys, of whom some were Christians,      but the larger part infidels. In this city were also some      shops kept by Sangleys, who lived here in order to sell the      goods which they kept here year by year. These Sangleys were      scattered among the Spaniards, with no specific place assigned      to them, until Don Gonzalo Ronquillo allotted them a place      to live in, and to be used as a silk-market (which is here      called _Parian_), of four large buildings. Here, many shops      were opened, commerce increased, and more Sangleys came to this      city.... When I came, all the Sangleys were almost forgotten,      and relegated to a corner. No thought was taken for their      conversion, because no one knew their language or undertook      to learn it on account of its great difficulty; and because      the religious who lived here were too busy with the natives of      these islands. Although the Augustinian religious had charge      of the Sangleys of Tondo, they did not minister to or instruct      them in their own language, but in that of the natives or this      land; thus the Sangley Christians living here, were Christians      only in name, knowing no more of Christianity than if they      had never accepted it.... Then I appealed to all religious      orders to appoint some one of their religious to learn the      language and take charge of the Sangleys. Although all of them      showed a desire to do so, and some even began to learn it,      yet no one succeeded; and the Sangleys found themselves with      no one to instruct them and take up their conversion with the      necessary earnestness, until, in the year eighty-seven, God      brought to these islands the religious of St. Dominic.\" [106]      So we find, as the Dominicans undertook their mission, a large  settlement of Chinese, including both a settled and a floating  population, concentrated in the Parian, across the Pasig river from  the main city of Manila.    The dominating figure of the Chinese mission from the time of his  arrival in the Philippines was Juan Cobo. In a letter, written by him  from the Parian of Manila, July 13, 1589, probably to ecclesiastical  authorities in Mexico, he gives an account of the early days of  the mission:          \"The Order took a site next to this Parian, since there was      not a single house between Santo Domingo and the Parian. And      because of this opportunity the Order presently charged      itself with the Chinese, both Christians and infidels. And      upon P. Fr. Miguel de Benavides and P. Fr. Juan Maldonado was      imposed the responsibility for the care of the Chinese and for      learning their language. P. Fr. Miguel was less occupied with      other matters than Fr. Juan Maldonado, so that he progressed      in the language enough to begin to catechize in it. This was      the first year the Order was in Manila.        \"Presently in the second year when I came, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16130"],[0,"Judgments of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand on Proceedings to Review Aspects (#7)"],[1,"of. We have set them out in full and it will be seen that  they all relate to two flight bags. It had seemed that paragraph 359  (1), in its context, might have conveyed the impression that Captain  Gemmell had removed these bags from the McMurdo store and brought them  or their contents back from Antarctica. At our hearing, however, Mr  Davison, who was one of the counsel for the Pilots Association both  before the Commission and in this court, made it clear responsibly and  fairly that this is not suggested.    As to Captain Eden, it has already been stated that the transcript  shows that the allegation expressed or implied in paragraph 348 was  never put to him. Having said so plainly, we need only add as regards  this particular complaint that the allegation, although it would  naturally have caused concern to Captain Eden and Air New Zealand, was  not as serious as the others that are complained of.    Whether the Court has jurisdiction to quash particular passages in the  report in addition to the costs order is a difficult and technical  question. We prefer not to lengthen this judgment with an unnecessary  discussion of it.    In modern administrative law, as a result of developments in both case  and statute law, the power of the Courts to grant declarations and quash  decisions is wider than was thought in the _Reynolds_ case in 1909 (29  N.Z.L.R. at 40). It may be that in a sufficiently clear-cut case the  jurisdiction, either under the Act or at common law, will be found to  extend to parts of Commission reports even when they are not linked with  costs orders.    But in the end that jurisdictional question does not have to be decided  in this case, and we reserve our opinion on it. If the jurisdiction does  go so far, it must be discretionary, as the grant of declarations always  is. The Court would have to be satisfied that grounds so strong as to  require it to act in that unusual way had been made out. In our opinion  they would be made out clearly enough as regards paragraph 377, which  stands out from the general body of the report. But the quashing of the  costs order because of its association with that paragraph is enough to  do justice there.    The position is less clear as regards the other paragraphs complained  of. For various reasons they are all in a marginal category. What has  been said in this judgment may help to enable them to be seen in  perspective. On balance we would not be prepared to hold that as to  these other paragraphs the applicants have made out a sufficiently  strong case to justify this Court in interfering, assuming that there is  jurisdiction to do so.    In the result, the application for review having succeeded on the main  issue, we see no need to and are not prepared to go further in granting  relief. Our decision is simply that the $150,000 costs order be quashed  on the grounds already stated.    As to the costs of the present proceedings, they should be reserved, as  there has been no argument on the matter.      _Solicitors_    Russell McVeagh McKenzie Bartleet & Co., Auckland, for First and Second  Applicants.

AND McMULLIN J.--DELIVERED BY WOODHOUSE P.      On 28th November 1979 a DC10-30 aircraft owned and operated by Air New  Zealand Limited crashed during daylight hours at a point 1465 feet above  mean sea level on the ice-covered lower slopes of Mount Erebus in the  Antarctic. It was a tragedy in which 257 lives were lost. The magnitude  of the disaster resulted in two separate investigations into the causes  of and circumstances surrounding the accident. The second inquiry took  the form of a Royal Commission appointed by Letters Patent and also  pursuant to the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908. Mr  Justice Mahon, a Judge of the High Court at Auckland, was appointed sole  Commissioner on 11th June 1980. He prepared the Commission's Report and  presented it on 16th April 1981.    The case now before this Court is entirely concerned with that Report.  But lest there be any misunderstanding it is necessary to emphasize at  the outset that no attack can be or indeed has been made upon the  conclusions it reaches as to the cause of the crash. Instead the  proceedings are brought by way of judicial review under the Judicature  Amendment Act 1972 in order to challenge statements in the Report about  the conduct of certain officers of Air New Zealand.    Senior officers of the airline are severely criticized in the Report and  in one paragraph on the basis of \"a pre-determined plan of deception ...  to conceal a series of disastrous administrative blunders ... an  orchestrated litany of lies\". These findings are challenged on grounds  that they were made unfairly, in disregard of basic principles of  natural justice and without jurisdiction. We are satisfied that those  complaints of the applicants are justified and that the statements  should never have been made. It was done without authority of the terms  of reference of the Commission and without any warning to the officers  affected. Thus they were given no opportunity at all to answer and deny  as they claim in affidavits now before this Court they were in a  position to do.    Because of the view we take of some aspects of the facts and of the law  we would be prepared to go further than the other members of the Court  in regard to the formal order to be made in this case. We also find it  necessary to go further in our conclusions in regard to a number of  matters of fact. We feel sure, however, that reputation can be  vindicated and the interests of justice met by the formal decision of  this Court which will have the effect of quashing a penal order of the  Commissioner requiring Air New Zealand to pay the large sum of $150,000  as costs in the Royal Commission Inquiry.      The Two Inquiries    Before the Royal Commission was appointed and began its work a statutory  investigation had already been carried out in terms of the Civil  Aviation (Accident Investigation) Regulations 1978. Immediately it was  known that the aircraft had crashed on Mount Erebus the standard  procedures for aircraft accident investigation were invoked by the Chief  Inspector of Air Accidents, Mr R. Chippindale. And he arrived in the  Antarctic with a small team of experts on the day following the  disaster. They included mountaineers, police, surveyors, the chief pilot  of Air New Zealand (Captain Gemmell), and a representative of the  Airline Pilots Association, named in the present proceedings as the  fifth respondent (First Officer Rhodes).    Mr Chippindale conducted intensive inquiries at the site of the crash  and instructed that all reasonable steps were to be taken to recover  equipment that would bear upon the cause of the accident and any  documents which were still accessible before they were blown away into  crevasses or covered with snow. Two important items were soon  discovered: the cockpit voice recorder was found at once and after a  period of systematic digging into the snow the digital flight data  recorder was recovered as well. The first piece of equipment provided a  tape recording of much that was said on the flight deck during a period  of 30 minutes preceding the time of the collision with the ice slope.  The second, often described as the \"black box\", provided conclusive  information concerning course, altitude, and other data relating to the  flight and functioning of the aircraft at the relevant period of time.    Mr Chippindale continued his investigation in New Zealand where he  inspected records gathered from the airline. He also interviewed pilots  and other officers with relevant information. In addition he travelled  overseas. At that point he prepared an interim report so that he could  give notice of his tentative findings to all those whom he felt might  have some degree of responsibility for the accident. Thus the airline  and representatives of the deceased pilots and others were given an  opportunity to provide any appropriate answer to the chief inspector  before he completed his final report. All this was attended to and his  report, which is dated 31st May 1980, was made available to the Minister  of Transport on 3rd June 1980. The Minister then approved the report for  release as a public document on 12th June 1980. As mentioned, the Royal  Commission was appointed for the purpose of conducting a public inquiry  at that same time.    There is a difference in the two reports upon the cause of the accident.  Mr Chippindale considered the probable cause to have been pilot error.  On the other hand the Royal Commission exonerated the pilots completely  and spoke instead of \"incompetent administrative airline procedures\".  Since this case is concerned with allegations by the "]]]
