E'en the meanest garb    Gives to true beauty fresh attractiveness.    [S']AKOONTALA. [Looking before her.    Yon Ke[S']ara-tree[22] beckons to me with its young shoots, which,  as the breeze waves them to and fro, appear like slender fingers.  I will go and attend to it.                                                 [_Walks towards it_.    PRIYAMVADA.    Dear [S']akoontala, prithee, rest in that attitude one moment.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Why so?    PRIYAMVADA    The Ke[S']ara-tree, whilst your graceful form bends about its stem,  appears as if it were wedded to some lovely twining creeper.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Ah! saucy girl, you are most appropriately named Priyamvada  ('Speaker of flattering things').    KING.    What Priyamvada says, though complimentary, is nevertheless true.  Verily,      Her ruddy lip vies with the opening bud;    Her graceful arms are as the twining stalks;    And her whole form is radiant with the glow    Of youthful beauty, as the tree with bloom.    ANASUYA.    See, dear [S']akoontala, here is the young jasmine, which you  named 'the Moonlight of the Grove,' the self-elected wife of the  mango-tree. Have you forgotten it?    [S']AKOONTALA.    Rather will I forget myself.                        [_Approaching the plant and looking at it_.]    How delightful is the season when the jasmine-creeper and the  mango-tree seem thus to unite in mutual embraces! The fresh  blossoms of the jasmine resemble the bloom of a young bride, and  the newly-formed shoots of the mango appear to make it her  natural protector.                                           [_Continues gazing at it_.    PRIYAMVADA.    Do you know, my Anasuya, why [S']akoontala gazes so intently at the  jasmine?    ANASUYA.    No, indeed, I cannot imagine. I pray thee tell me.    PRIYAMVADA.    She is wishing that as the jasmine is united to a suitable tree,  so, in like manner, she may obtain a husband worthy of her.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Speak for yourself, girl; this is the thought in your own mind.                                   [_Continues watering the flowers_.    KING.    Would that my union with her were permissible[23]! and yet I  hardly dare hope that the maiden is sprung from a caste different  from that of the Head of the hermitage. But away with doubt:      That she is free to wed a warrior-king    My heart attests. For, in conflicting doubts,    The secret promptings of the good man's soul    Are an unerring index of the truth.    However, come what may, I will ascertain the fact.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                      [_In a flurry_.    Ah! a bee, disturbed by the sprinkling of the water, has left the  young jasmine, and is trying to settle on my face.                                        [_Attempts to drive it away_.    KING.                                  [_Gazing at her ardently_.    Beautiful! there is something charming even in her repulse.      Where'er the bee his eager onset plies,    Now here, now there, she darts her kindling eyes;    What love hath yet to teach, fear teaches now,    The furtive glances and the frowning brow.                                                 [_In a tone of envy_.      Ah, happy bee! how boldly dost thou try    To steal the lustre from her sparkling eye;    And in thy circling movements hover near,    To murmur tender secrets in her ear;    Or, as she coyly waves her hand, to sip    Voluptuous nectar from her lower lip!    While rising doubts my heart's fond hopes destroy,    Thou dost the fulness of her charms enjoy.    [S']AKOONTALA.    This impertinent bee will not rest quiet. I must move elsewhere.    [_Moving a few steps off, and casting a glance around_.]    How now! he is following me here. Help! my dear friends, help!  deliver me from the attacks of this troublesome insect.    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    How can we deliver you? Call Dushyanta to your aid. The sacred  groves are under the King's special protection.    KING.    An excellent opportunity for me to show myself.  Fear not--    [_Checks himself when the words are half-uttered; Aside_.]    But stay, if I introduce myself in this manner, they will know me  to be the King. Be it so, I will accost them, nevertheless.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                 [_Moving a step or two further off_.    What! it still persists in following me.    KING.                                       [_Advancing hastily_.      When mighty Puru's offspring sways the earth,    And o'er the wayward holds his threatening rod,    Who dares molest the gentle maids that keep    Their holy vigils here in Kanwa's grove?    [_All look at the_ KING, _and all are embarrassed_.    ANASUYA.    Kind Sir, no outrage has been committed; only our dear friend  here was teased by the attacks of a troublesome bee.                                            [_Points to_ [S']AKOONTALA.    KING.                                  [_Turning to_ [S']AKOONTALA.    I trust all is well with your devotional rites[24]?                          [[S']AKOONTALA _stands confused and silent_.]    ANASUYA.    All is well indeed, now that we are honoured by the reception of  a distinguished guest. Dear [S']akoontala, go, bring from the  hermitage an offering of flowers, rice, and fruit. This water  that we have brought with us will serve to bathe our guest's  feet[25].    KING.    The rites of hospitality are already performed; your truly kind  words are the best offering I can receive.    PRIYAMVADA.    At least be good enough, gentle Sir, to sit down awhile, and rest  yourself on this seat shaded by the leaves of the Sapta-parna  tree[26].    KING.    You, too, must all be fatigued by your employment.    ANASUYA.    Dear [S']akoontala, there is no impropriety in our sitting by the  side of our guest; come, let us sit down here.                                            [_All sit down together_.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                            [_Aside_.    How is it that the sight of this made me sensible of emotions  inconsistent with religious vows?    KING.                             [_Gazing at them all By turns_.    How charmingly your friendship is in keeping with the equality of  your ages and appearance!    PRIYAMVADA.                                  [_Aside to ANASUYA_.    Who can this person be, whose lively yet dignified manner, and  polite conversation, bespeak him a man of high rank?    ANASUYA.    I, too, my dear, am very curious to know. I will ask him myself.    [_Aloud_]    Your kind words, noble Sir, fill me with confidence, and prompt  me to inquire of what regal family our noble guest is the  ornament? what country is now mourning his absence? and what  induced a person so delicately nurtured to expose himself to the  fatigue of visiting this grove of penance?    [S']AKOONTALA.                                            [_Aside_.    Be not troubled, O my heart, Anasuya is giving utterance to thy  thoughts.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    How now shall I reply? shall I make myself known, or shall I  still disguise my real rank? I have it; I will answer her thus.  [_Aloud_.] I am the person charged by his Majesty, the descendant  of Puru, with the administration of justice and religion; and am  come to this sacred grove to satisfy myself that the rites of the  hermits are free from obstruction.    ANASUYA.    The hermits, then, and all the members of our religious society,  have now a guardian.                          [[S']AKOONTALA _gazes bashfully at the_ KING.      PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.          [_Perceiving the state of her feelings, and of the_ KING'S.                                            _Aside to_ [S']AKOONTALA.    Dear [S']akoontala, if father Kanwa were but at home to-day--    [S']AKOONTALA.                                           [_Angrily_.    What if he were?    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    He would honour this our distinguished guest with an offering of  the most precious of his possessions.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Go to! you have some silly idea in your minds, I will not listen  to such remarks.    KING.    May I be allowed, in my turn, to ask you maidens a few  particulars respecting your friend?    PRIYAMVADA AND ANASUYA.    Your request, Sir, is an honour.    KING.    The sage Kanwa lives in the constant practice of austerities.  How, then, can this friend of yours be called his daughter?    ANASUYA.    I will explain to you. Sir. You have heard of an illustrious sage  of regal caste, Vi[s']wamitra, whose family name is Kau[S']ika[27].    KING.    I have.    ANASUYA.    Know that he is the real father of our friend. The venerable  Kanwa is only her reputed father. He it was who brought her up,  when she was deserted by her mother.    KING.    'Deserted by her mother!' My curiosity is excited; pray let me  hear the story from the beginning.    ANASUYA.    You shall hear it, Sir. Some time since, this sage of regal  caste, while performing a most severe penance on the banks of the  river Godavari, excited the jealousy and alarm of the gods;  insomuch that they despatched a lovely nymph named Menaka to  interrupt his devotions.    KING.    The inferior gods, I am aware, are jealous[28] of the power which  the practice of excessive devotion confers on mortals.    ANASUYA.    Well, then, it happened that Vi[s']wamitra, gazing on the  bewitching beauty of that nymph at a season when, spring being in  its glory--                                [_Stops short, and appears confused_.    KING.    The rest may be easily divined. [S']akoontala, then, is the  offspring of the nymph.    ANASUYA.    Just so.    KING.    It is quite intelligible.      How would a mortal to such charms give birth?    The lightning's radiance flashes not from earth.           [[S']AKOONTALA _remains modestly seated with downcast eyes_.

Now, will you kindly explain to me how a man,  boxed up in a pitch-dark carriage, is going to identify any place to  which he may be carried?\"    \"The problem doesn't appear to me to present any serious difficulties,\"  he replied.    \"Doesn't it?\" said I. \"To me it looks like a pretty solid impossibility.  But what do you suggest? Should I break out of the house and run away up  the street? Or should I bore a hole through the shutter of the carriage  and peep out?\"    Thorndyke smiled indulgently. \"The methods proposed by my learned friend  display a certain crudity inappropriate to the character of a man of  science; to say nothing of the disadvantage of letting the enemy into  our counsels. No, no, Jervis; we can do something better than that.  Just excuse me for a minute while I run up to the laboratory.\"    He hurried away to Polton's sanctum on the upper floor, leaving me to  speculate on the method by which he proposed that a man should be  enabled, as Sam Weller would express it, \"to see through a flight of  stairs and a deal door\"; or, what was equally opaque, the wooden  shutters of a closed carriage.    \"Now,\" he said, when he returned a couple of minutes later with a small,  paper-covered notebook in his hand, \"I have set Polton to work on a  little appliance that will, I think, solve our difficulty, and I will  show you how I propose that you should make your observations. First of  all, we have to rule the pages of this book into columns.\"    He sat down at the table and began methodically to rule the pages each  into three columns, two quite narrow and one broad. The process occupied  some time, during which I sat and watched with impatient curiosity the  unhurried, precise movements of Thorndyke's pencil, all agog to hear the  promised explanation. He was just finishing the last page when there  came a gentle tap at the door, and Polton entered with a satisfied smile  on his dry, shrewd-looking face and a small board in his hand.    \"Will this do, sir?\" he asked.    As he spoke he handed the little board to Thorndyke, who looked at it  and passed it to me.    \"The very thing, Polton,\" my friend replied. \"Where did you find it?  It's of no use for you to pretend that you've made it in about two  minutes and a half.\"    Polton smiled one of his queer crinkly smiles, and remarking that \"it  didn't take much making,\" departed much gratified by the compliment.    \"What a wonderful old fellow that is, Jervis,\" Thorndyke observed as his  factotum retired. \"He took in the idea instantly and seems to have  produced the finished article by magic, as the conjurers bring forth  rabbits and bowls of goldfish at a moment's notice. I suppose you see  what your <i>modus operandi</i> is to be?\"    I had gathered a clue from the little appliance--a plate of white  fret-wood about seven inches by five, to one corner of which a  pocket-compass had been fixed with shellac--but was not quite clear as  to the details of the method.    \"You can read a compass pretty quickly, I think?\" Thorndyke said.    \"Of course I can. Used we not to sail a yacht together when we were  students?\"    \"To be sure we did; and we will again before we die. And now as to your  method of locating this house. Here is a pocket reading-lamp which you  can hook on the carriage lining. This notebook can be fixed to the board  with an india-rubber band--thus. You observe that the thoughtful Polton  has stuck a piece of thread on the glass of the compass to serve as a  lubber's line. This is how you will proceed. As soon as you are locked  in the carriage, light your lamp--better have a book with you in case  the light is noticed--take out your watch and put the board on your  knee, keeping its long side exactly in a line with the axis of the  carriage. Then enter in one narrow column of your notebook the time, in  the other the direction shown by the compass, and in the broad column  any particulars, including the number of steps the horse makes in a  minute. Like this.\"    He took a loose sheet of paper and made one or two sample entries on it  in pencil, thus--      \"9.40.  S.E.    Start from home.     9.41   S.W.    Granite setts.     9.43.  S.W.    Wood pavement. Hoofs 104.     9.47.  W. by S Granite crossing. Macadam--    and so on. Note every change of direction, with the time; and whenever  you hear or feel anything from outside, note it, with the time and  direction; and don't forget to note any variations in the horse's pace.  You follow the process?\"    \"Perfectly. But do you think the method is accurate enough to fix the  position of a house? Remember, this is only a pocket-compass with no  dial, and it will jump frightfully. And the mode of estimating distance  is very rough.\"    \"That is all perfectly true,\" Thorndyke answered. \"But you are  overlooking certain important facts The track-chart that you will  produce can be checked by other data. The house, for instance, has a  covered way by which you could identify it if you knew approximately  where to look for it. Then you must remember that your carriage is not  travelling over a featureless plain. It is passing through streets which  have a determined position and direction and which are accurately  represented on the ordnance map. I think, Jervis, that, in spite of the  apparent roughness of the method, if you make your observations  carefully, we shall have no trouble in narrowing down the inquiry to a  quite small area. If we get the chance, that is to say.\"    \"Yes, if we do. I am doubtful whether Mr. Weiss will require my services  again, but I sincerely hope he will. It would be rare sport to locate  his secret burrow, all unsuspected. But now I must really be off.\"    \"Good-bye, then,\" said Thorndyke, slipping a well-sharpened pencil  through the rubber band that fixed the notebook to the board. \"Let me  know how the adventure progresses--if it progresses at all--and  remember, I hold your promise to come and see me again quite soon in any  case.\"    He handed me the board and the lamp, and, when I had slipped them into  my pocket, we shook hands and I hurried away, a little uneasy at having  left my charge so long.          Chapter III    \"A Chiel's Amang Ye Takin' Notes\"      The attitude of the suspicious man tends to generate in others the kind  of conduct that seems to justify his suspicions. In most of us there  lurks a certain strain of mischief which trustfulness disarms but  distrust encourages. The inexperienced kitten which approaches us  confidingly with arched back and upright tail, soliciting caresses,  generally receives the gentle treatment that it expects; whereas the  worldly-wise tom-cat, who, in response to friendly advances, scampers  away and grins at us suspiciously from the fancied security of an  adjacent wall, impels us to accelerate his retreat with a well-directed  clod.    Now the proceedings of Mr. H. Weiss resembled those of the tom-cat  aforesaid and invited an analogous reply. To a responsible professional  man his extraordinary precautions were at once an affront and a  challenge. Apart from graver considerations, I found myself dwelling  with unholy pleasure on the prospect of locating the secret hiding-place  from which he seemed to grin at me with such complacent defiance; and I  lost no time and spared no trouble in preparing myself for the  adventure. The very hansom which bore me from the Temple to Kennington  Lane was utilized for a preliminary test of Thorndyke's little  apparatus. During the whole of that brief journey I watched the compass  closely, noted the feel and sound of the road-material and timed the  trotting of the horse. And the result was quite encouraging. It is true  that the compass-needle oscillated wildly to the vibration of the cab,  but still its oscillations took place around a definite point which was  the average direction, and it was evident to me that the data it  furnished were very fairly reliable. I felt very little doubt, after the  preliminary trial, as to my being able to produce a moderately  intelligible track-chart if only I should get an opportunity to exercise  my skill.    But it looked as if I should not. Mr. Weiss's promise to send for me  again soon was not fulfilled. Three days passed and still he made no  sign. I began to fear that I had been too outspoken; that the shuttered  carriage had gone forth to seek some more confiding and easy-going  practitioner, and that our elaborate preparations had been made in vain.  When the fourth day drew towards a close and still no summons had come,  I was disposed reluctantly to write the case off as a lost opportunity.    And at that moment, in the midst of my regrets, the bottle-boy thrust an  uncomely head in at the door. His voice was coarse, his accent was  hideous, and his grammatical construction beneath contempt; but I  forgave him all when I gathered the import of his message.    \"Mr. Weiss's carriage is waiting, and he says will you come as quickly  as you can because he's took very bad to-night.\"    I sprang from my chair and hastily collected the necessaries for the  journey. The little board and the lamp I put in my overcoat pocket; I  overhauled the emergency bag and added to its usual contents a bottle of  permanganate of potassium which I thought I might require. Then I tucked  the evening paper under my arm and went out.    The coachman, who was standing at the horse's head as I emerged, touched  his hat and came forward to open the door.    \"I have fortified myself for the long drive, you see,\" I remarked,  exhibiting the newspaper as I stepped into the carriage.    \"But you can't read in the dark,\" said he.    \"No, but I have provided myself with a lamp,\" I replied, producing it  and striking a match.    He watched me as I lit the lamp and hooked it on the back cushion, and  observed:    \"I suppose you found it rather a dull ride last time. It's a longish  way. They might have fitted the carriage with an inside"]]]
