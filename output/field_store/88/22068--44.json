They do not commence laying till May, and I have  taken eggs nearly fresh as late as the 15th August. I do not think the  bird breeds twice, as the earliest eggs taken were found on the 10th  May.    \"They build in hill oaks as a rule, the height of the nest from the  ground varying much, some being as low as 10 feet, others nearer 30  feet. The hen bird sits close, and sometimes (when the nest is high  up) does not even leave the nest when the tree is struck below.  The nest is a rough structure built close to the trunk, externally  consisting of twigs and roots and lined with fibres. The egg-cavity is  circular and shallow, not at all neatly lined. The outer part of  the nest is large compared to what I should call the true nest, and  consists of a heap of twigs, &c. like what is gathered together for  the platform of a Crow's nest.    \"The eggs, which are four in number, vary in length from 1.45 to 1.25,  and in breadth from 0.9 to 0.75. The ordinary type is an egg a good  deal pointed at the thinner end. The ground-colour is greenish white,  blotched and freckled with ruddy brown, with a ring at the larger end  of confluent spots. The young birds are of a very dull colour until  after the first month. The normal number of eggs laid appears to be  four.\"    Captain Cock wrote to me:--\"_U. flavirostris_ is common at Dhurmsala,  but the nest is rather difficult to find. I have only taken six in  three years. It is usually placed amongst the branches of the hill  oak, where it has been polled, and the thickly growing shoots afford a  good cover; but sometimes it is on the top of a small slender sapling.  The nest is a good-sized structure of sticks with a rather deep cup  lined with dried roots; in fact, it is very much like the nest of  _Garrulus lanceolatus_, only larger and much deeper. They generally  lay four eggs, which differ much in colour and markings.\"    Dr. Jerdon says:--\"I had the nest and eggs brought me once. The nest  was made of sticks and roots. The eggs, three in number, were of a  greenish-fawn colour very faintly blotched with brown.\"    The eggs are of the ordinary Indian Magpie type, scarcely, if at all,  smaller than those of _U. occipitalis_, and larger than the average of  eggs of either _Dendrocitta rufa_ or _D. himalayensis_. Doubtless  all kinds of varieties occur, as the eggs of this family are very  variable; but I have only seen two types--in the one the ground is a  pale dingy yellowish stone-colour, profusely streaked, blotched, and  mottled with a somewhat pale brown, more or less olivaceous in some  eggs, the markings even in this type being generally densest towards  the large end, where they form an irregular mottled cap: in the other  type the ground is a very pale greenish-drab colour; there is a dense  confluent raw-sienna-coloured zone round the large end, and only a few  spots and specks of the same colour scattered about the rest of the  egg. All kinds of intermediate varieties occur. The texture of the  shell is fine and compact, and the eggs are mostly more or less  glossy.    The eggs vary from 1.22 to 1.48 in length, and from 0.8 to 0.96 in  breadth; but the average of twenty-seven eggs is 1.3 by 0.92.      14. Cissa chinensis (Bodd.). _The Green Magpie_.

According to Mr. Hodgson's notes the Green Magpie breeds in Nepal in  the lower valleys and in the Terai from April to July. The nest is  built in clumps of bamboos and is large and cup-shaped, composed of  sticks and leaves, coated externally with bamboo-leaves and vegetable  fibres, and lined inside with fine roots. It lays four eggs, one of  which is figured as a broad oval, a good deal pointed towards one end,  with a pale stone-coloured ground freckled and mottled all over with  sepia-brown, and measuring 1.27 by 0.89.    Mr. Oates writes:--\"In the Pegu Hills on the 19th April I found the  nest of the Green Magpie, and shot the female off it.    \"The nest was placed in a small tree, about 20 feet from the ground,  in a nullah and well exposed to view. The nest was neatly built,  exteriorly of leaves and coarse roots, and finished off interiorly  with finer fibres and roots; depth about 2 inches; inside diameter 6  inches. Contained three eggs nearly hatched; all got broken; I have  the fragments of one. The ground-colour is greenish white, much  spotted and freckled with pale yellowish-brown spots and dashes, more  so at the larger end than elsewhere.\"    Sundry fragments that reached me, kindly sent to me by Mr. Oates, had  a dull white ground, very thickly freckled and mottled all over, as  far as I could judge, with dull, pale, yellowish brown and purplish  grey, the former preponderating greatly. As to size and shape, this  deponent sayeth nought.    Major Bingham writes from Tenasserim:--\"On the 18th April I found a  nest of this most lovely bird placed at a height of 5 feet from the  ground in the fork of a bamboo-bush. It was a broad, massive, and  rather shallow cup of twigs, roots, and bamboo-leaves outside, and  lined with finer roots. It contained three eggs of a pale greenish  stone-colour, thickly and very minutely speckled with brown, which  tend to coalesce and form a cap at the larger end. I shot the female  as she flew off the nest.\"    Major Bingham subsequently found another nest in Tenasserim, about  which he says:--    \"Crossing the Wananatchoung, a little tributary of the Thoungyeen, by  the highroad leading from Meeawuddy to the sources of the Thoungyeen,  I found in a small thorny tree on the 8th April a nest of the above  bird--a great, firmly-built but shallow saucer of twigs, 6 feet or so  above the ground, and lined with fine black roots. It contained three  fresh eggs of a dingy greyish white, thickly speckled chiefly at the  large end, where it forms a cap, with light purplish brown. The eggs  measure 1.25 x 0.89, 1.18 x 0.92, and 1.20 x 0.90.\"    Mr. James Inglis notes from Cachar:--\"This Jay is rather rare; it  frequents low quiet jungle. In April last a Kuki brought me three  young ones he had taken from a nest in a clump of tree-jungle; he said  the nest was some 20 feet from the ground and made of bamboo-leaves  and grass.\"    A nest of this species taken below Yendong in Native Sikhim, on the  28th April, contained four fresh eggs. It was placed on the branches  of a medium-sized tree at a height of about 12 feet from the ground;  it was a large oval saucer, 8 inches by 6, and about 2.5 in depth,  composed mainly of dry bamboo-leaves, bound firmly together with fine  stems of creepers, and was lined with moderately fine roots; the  cavity was 5 inches by 4, and about 1 in depth.    The eggs received from Major Bingham, as also others received from  Sikhim, where they were procured by Mr. Mandelli on the 21st and 28th  of April, are rather broad ovals, somewhat pointed towards the small  end. The shell is fine, but has only a little gloss. The ground-colour  is white or slightly greyish white, and they are uniformly freckled  all over with very pale yellowish and greyish brown. The frecklings  are always somewhat densest at the large end, where in some eggs  they form a dull brown cap or zone. In some eggs the markings are  everywhere denser, in some sparser, so that some eggs look yellower or  browner, and others paler.    The eggs are altogether of the _Garruline_ type, not of that of the  _Dendrocitta_ or _Urocissa_ type. I have eggs of _G. lanceolatus_,  that but for being smaller precisely match some of the _Cissa_ eggs.  Jerdon is, I think, certainly wrong in placing _Cissa_ between  _Urocissa_ and _Dendrocitta_, the eggs of which two last are of the  same and quite a distinct type[A].    [Footnote A: I am responsible, and not Mr. Hume, for calling this bird  a Magpie. Jerdon calls it a Jay, but places it among the Magpies,  which is, I consider, its proper position, notwithstanding the colour  of its eggs.--ED.]    The eggs vary from 1.15 to 1.26 in length, and from 0.9 to 0.95 in  breadth, but the average of eight is 1.21 by 0.92.      15. Cissa ornata (Wagler). _The Ceylonese Magpie_.    Cissa ornata (_Wagl._), _Hume, Cat._ no. 673 bis.    Colonel Legge writes in his 'Birds of Ceylon':--\"This bird breeds  during the cool season. I found its nest in the Kandapolla jungles  in January; it was situated in a fork of the top branch of a tall  sapling, about 45 feet in height, and was a tolerably bulky structure,  externally made of small sticks, in the centre of which was a deep  cup 5 inches in diameter by 21/2 in depth, made entirely of fine roots;  there was but one egg in the nest, which unfortunately got broken in  being lowered to the ground. It was ovate and slightly pyriform, of  a faded bluish-green ground thickly spotted all over with very light  umber-brown, over larger spots of bluish-grey. It measured 0.98 inch  in diameter by _about_ 1.3 in length.\"      16. Dendrocitta rufa (Scop.). _The Indian Tree-pie_.    Dendrocitta rufa (_Scop._), _Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 314; _Hume, Rough  Notes N. & E._ no. 674.    The Indian Tree-pie breeds throughout the continent of India, alike in  the plains and in the hills, up to an elevation of 6000 or 7000 feet.    I personally have found the nest with eggs in May, June, July,  and during the first week of August, in various districts in the  North-West Provinces, and have had them sent me from Saugor (taken  in July) and from Hansi (taken in April, May, and June); but perhaps  because the bird is so common scarcely any one has sent me notes about  its nidification, and I hardly know whether in other parts of India  and Burma its breeding-season is the same as with us.    The nest is always placed in trees, generally in a fork, near the top  of good large ones; babool and mango are very commonly chosen in the  North-West Provinces, though I have also found it on neem and sisso "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13119"],[0,"Jean François Millet (#7)"],[1,"a river may take in the life of French  country people. Sometimes it is the sole source of water for a  village. Then it is not only the common village laundry, in which all  clothing is washed, but it is also the great village fountain, from  which all drinking-water is drawn.    The women in our picture have come to the bank with big earthen jars  to fill. It is in the cool of early morning, and the mist still lies  thick over the marshes bordering the river. The sun, seen through the  mist, looks like a round ball. On the farther bank, where a group of  poplars grow, some horsemen ride up to ford the stream. They, too, are  setting forth early on their day's work. One is already half across.    The women have picked out, along the marshy bank, a point of land  jutting into the river like a miniature promontory, and seemingly of  firm soil. It is only large enough to hold one at a time, so they take  turns. One is now filling a bottle, while the other waits, standing  beside two jars.    The first woman kneels on the ground, and supporting herself firmly  by placing one hand on the edge of the bank, she grasps the jar by  the handle, with her free right hand, and swings it well out over the  water. Experience has taught her the most scientific way of filling  the jar with least muscular strain. She does not try to plunge it down  into the water, but holding it on its side, slightly tipped, draws it  along with the mouth half under the surface, sucking in the water as  it moves. We see what hard, firm muscles she has to hold the arm out  so tensely. Her arm acts like a compass describing the arc of a circle  through the water with the jar. As we look, we can almost see her  completing the circle, and drawing up the full jar upon the bank.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. FILLING THE  WATER-BOTTLES John Andrew & Son, Sc.]    The woman who waits her turn is capable of the same feat. There is  power in every line of her figure as she stands in what has been well  described by a critic as a \"majestic pose.\" She straightens back  to rest, with her arms on her hips, quite unconscious that there is  anything fine in her appearance.    Look a minute and you will see that she is the woman of the Angelus.  As we saw her in the other picture, with head bowed and hands clasped  on her breast, we did not realize how grand and strong she was. But  raising her head, throwing back her chest, and putting her arms on her  sides, she shows us now her full power.    Both women are dressed alike in the clothing which is now familiar  to us from the other pictures,--coarse gowns made with scanty skirts,  long aprons reaching nearly to the bottom of the dress, kerchiefs  fastened snugly about their heads, and wooden sabots. We could not  imagine anything that would become them better. It is part of the  French nature to understand the art of dressing, and this art is  found just as truly among the peasants of the provinces as in the  fashionable world at Paris.    The picture is a study in black and white which any one who cares for  drawing will wish to examine attentively. He was indeed a master who  could, with a single bit of charcoal, make us feel the witchery of  this early morning hour by the river-side. We note the many different  \"tones\" of the picture,--the faint soft mist of the distant atmosphere  over the marshes, growing darker on the poplars and the hilly bank in  the middle distance; the shadow of the bank in the river; the gleam of  the sunlight on the calm water mid-stream; the ripples about the jar;  the sharply defined figures of the women, dark on the side turned  from the sun; and the quivering shadow of the kneeling woman in the  ripple-broken water in front.    Among primitive peoples the hour of sunrise was a sacred time, when  hymns were sung and sacrifices were offered to the life-giving sun.  The painter Millet has expressed something of the mystic solemnity of  the hour in this picture. The sun has awakened the world to work, and  in its strength men and women go forth to labor.[1]      [Footnote 1: A fine passage on the morning occurs in Thoreau's second  chapter of _Walden_.]          IX    FEEDING HER BIRDS      As we have already seen in the picture of the Woman Feeding Hens, the  dooryard in French village homes is so shut in by walls, that it  has the privacy of a family living-room. This was the arrangement in  Millet's own home at Barbizon. The painter was among the fortunate  ones who had a garden beyond the dooryard. At the other end of this  was his studio, where he worked many hours of the day. It is said  that he used to leave the door open that he might hear the children's  voices at their play. Sometimes, indeed, he would call them in to  look at his pictures, and was always much pleased when they seemed to  understand and like them. We may be sure that he often looked across  the garden to the dooryard where the family life was going on, and  at such times he must have caught many a pretty picture. Perhaps our  picture of this mother feeding her children was suggested in this way.    Three healthy, happy children have been playing about in the yard,--a  girl of six, her younger sister, and a brother still younger. They are  dressed simply, so as to enjoy themselves thoroughly without fear  of injuring any fine clothes. All three wear long aprons and wooden  sabots. The little girls have their flying hair confined in close  bonnet caps tied under the chin. The boy rejoices in a round cap  ornamented on top with a button. The sisters take great care of their  little brother.    The toys are of a very rude sort and evidently of home manufacture. A  cart is constructed of a board set on clumsy wheels. A doll is roughly  shaped of wood and wrapped in a hood and blanket. There is a basket  besides, in which one can gather bits of treasure picked up here and  there in the yard.    By and by the play is interrupted by a familiar voice. The children  look up and see their mother standing smiling in the doorway. A bowl  which she has in her hand is still steaming, and an appetizing odor  reminds them that they are hungry. The basket and the cart are hastily  dropped, but not the doll, and they all run to the doorstep. The  brother is placed in the middle and the sisters seat themselves  on either side. The elder girl still holds her doll with maternal  solicitude; the other two children clasp hands, and the sister's arm  is put around the boy's neck.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. FEEDING HER BIRDS]    Meanwhile the mother has seated herself directly in front of them, on  a low stool such as is used by country people as a milking-stool. She  tips it a little as she leans over to feed the children in turn from a  long-handled wooden spoon. Of course the first taste is for the little  brother, and he stretches out his neck eagerly, opening his mouth wide  so as not to lose a drop. The sisters look on eagerly, the younger one  opening her own mouth a little, quite unconsciously. An inquisitive  hen runs up to see what good things there are to eat. In the garden  beyond, the father works busily at his spading.    The name which Millet gave to this picture is the French word  _Becquee_, which cannot be translated into any corresponding word in  English. It means a _beakful_, that is, the food which the mother bird  holds in her beak to give to the nestlings.    The painter had in mind, you see, a nestful of birds being fed. The  similarity between the family and the bird life is closely carried  out in the picture. The children sit together as snugly as birds in  a nest. The mother bends toward them in a brooding attitude which  is like the bird mother's. Her extended hand suggests a bird's beak,  tapering to a sharp point at the end of the spoon. The young bird's  mouth is wide open, and in pops the nice spoonful of broth! The  house itself is made to look like a cosy little nest by the vine that  embowers it. The sturdy stem runs up close by the doorstep and sends  out over door and window its broad branches of beautiful green leaves.    And just as the father bird watches the nest from his perch on some  branch of the tree, the father at work in the garden can look from  time to time at the little family circle in the doorway. As in the  picture of the Woman Feeding Hens, the house is built of stone covered  with plaster. The door casing is of large ill-matched blocks of stone.  The dooryard is made to appear much larger by the glimpse of the  orchard we get through the gateway. No out-of-door picture is complete  which does not show something of the beauty of nature. The dooryard  itself would be a bare place but for the shady garden beyond.          X    THE CHURCH AT GREVILLE      The village-commune of Greville has nothing to make it famous except  that it was the birthplace of the painter Millet. It is at the tip  of Cape La Hague, which juts abruptly from the French coast into the  English channel. The cape is a steep headland bristling with granite  rocks and needles, and very desolate seen from the sea. Inland it is  pleasant and fruitful, with apple orchards and green meadows.    The village life centres about the church, for the inhabitants of  Grenville are a serious and God-fearing people. The church is the spot  around which cluster the most sacred associations of life. Here the  babies are baptized, and the youths and maidens confirmed; here  the young people are married, and from here young and old alike are  carried to their last resting-place. The building is hallowed by the  memories of many generations of pious ancestors.    The Millet family lived in an outlying hamlet (Gruchy) of Grenville,  and were somewhat far from the church. Yet they had even more  associations with it than other village families. Here our painter's  father had early shown his talent for music at the head of the choir"]]]
