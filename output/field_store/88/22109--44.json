The sentence was rendered more severe than usual in such  cases by the fact that Meinhold, who appears to possess more talent  than temper, had previously been condemned for the same offense  against another party. The _Amber Witch_ is one of the \"curiosities of  literature\", for in the last German edition the author is obliged to  prove that it is entirely a work of imagination, and not, as almost  all the German critics believed it to be when it appeared, the reprint  of an old chronicle. It was, in fact, written as a trap for the  disciples of Strauss and his school, who had pronounced the Scriptures  of the Old and New Testaments to be a collection, of legends, from  historical research, assisted by \"internal evidence\". Meinhold did  not spare them when they fell into the snare, and made merry with the  historical knowledge and critical acumen that could not detect  the contemporary romancer under the mask of the chronicler of two  centuries ago, while they decided so positively as to the authority of  the most ancient writings in the world. He has been in prison before.           *       *       *       *       *    \"THE NIGHT SIDE OF NATURE[1]\", by Catharine Crowe, so well known as  one of the cleverest of the younger set of literary women in England,  we have already mentioned as in the press of Mr. Redfield; it is  now published, and we commend it as one of the most entertaining and  curious works that has ever appeared on the \"wonders of the invisible  world\". We quote from the judicious critic of the _Tribune_ the  following paragraphs in regard to it:    [Footnote 1: The Night side of Nature; or, Ghosts and Ghost Seers. By  Catherine Crowe. New York. J.S. Redfield.]    \"The author of this work is an accomplished German scholar. Without  being a slave to the superstitious love of marvels and prodigies, her  mind evidently leans toward the twilight sphere, which lies beyond  the acknowledged boundaries of either faith or knowledge. She seems  to be entirely free from the sectarian spirit; she can look at facts  impartially, without reference to their bearing on favorite dogmas;  nor does she claim such a full, precise and completely-rounded  acquaintance with the mysteries of the spiritual world, whether from  intuition or revelation, as not to believe that there may be more  \"things in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in our philosophy.\"  In this respect, it must be owned that she has not the advantage of  certain religious journals in this city, like the _Christian Inquirer_  and _The Independent_, for instance--which have been so fully  initiated into the secrets of universal truth as to regard all inquiry  into such subjects either as too vulgar for a Christian gentleman,  _comme il faut_, or as giving a \"sanction to the atheistic  delusion that there may be a spiritual or supernatural agency\" in  manifestations which are not accounted for by the New-England Primer.  Mrs. Crowe, on the contrary, supposes that there may be something  worthy of philosophical investigation in those singular phenomena,  which, surpassing the limits of usual experience, have not yet found  any adequate explanation.    \"The phrase 'Night Side of Nature' is borrowed from the Germans, who  derive it from the language of astronomers, designating the side of  a planet that is turned from the sun, as its night side. The Germans  draw a parallel between our vague and misty perceptions, when deprived  of the light of the sun, and the obscure and uncertain glimpses we  obtain of the vailed department of nature, of which, though comprising  the solution of the most important questions, we are in a state of  almost total ignorance. In writing a book on these subjects, the  author disclaims the intention of enforcing any didactic opinions. She  wishes only to suggest inquiry and stimulate observation, in order to  gain all possible light on our spiritual nature, both as it now exists  in the flesh and is to exist hereafter out of it.    \"It is but justice to say, that the present volume is a successful  realization of the purpose thus announced. It presents as full a  collection of facts on the subject as is probably to be found in any  work in the English language, furnishing materials for the formation  of theoretic views, and illustrating an obscure but most interesting  chapter in the marvelous history of human nature. It is written  with perfect modesty, and freedom from pretense, doing credit to the  ability of the author as a narrator, as well as to her fairness and  integrity as a reasoner.\"           *       *       *       *       *    MR.

HERBERT'S NEW BOOKS.--The _Southern Quarterly Review_ for July  has the following notice of \"Frank Forester's Fish and Fishing in the  United States and British Provinces,\" recently published by Stringer &  Townsend:    \"There are few of our writers so variously endowed and accomplished as  Mr. Herbert; of a mind easily warmed and singularly enthusiastic, the  natural bent of his talent inclines him to romance. He has accordingly  given us several stories abounding in stately scenes, and most  impressive portraiture. Well skilled in the use of the mother tongue,  as in the broad fields of classical literature, he has written essays  of marked eloquence, and criticisms of excellent discrimination and a  keen and thorough insight. His contributions to our periodicals have  been even more happy than his fictions. With a fine imagination, he  inherits a _penchant_ and a capacity for poetry, which has enabled him  to throw off, without an effort, some of the most graceful fugitive  effusions which have been written in America. His accomplishments are  as various as his talents. He can paint a landscape as sweetly as  he can describe it in words. He is a sportsman of eager impulse, and  relishes equally well the employments of the fisherman and hunter.  He is a naturalist, as well as a sportsman, and brings, to aid his  practice and experience, a large knowledge, from study, of the habits  of birds, beasts and fishes. He roves land and sea in this pursuit,  forest and river, and turns, with equal ease and readiness, from  a close examination of Greek and Roman literature, to an emulous  exercise of all the arts which have afforded renown to the aboriginal  hunter. The volume before us--one of many which he has given to this  subject--is one of singular interest to the lover of the rod and  angle. It exhibits, on every page, a large personal knowledge of  the finny tribes in all the northern portions of our country, and  well deserves the examination of those who enjoy such pursuits and  pastimes. The author's pencil has happily illustrated the labors of  his pen. His portraits of the several fishes of the United States are  exquisitely well done and truthful. It is our hope, in future pages,  to furnish an ample review of this, and other interesting volumes, of  similar character, from the hand of our author. We have drawn to them  the attention of some rarely endowed persons of our own region, who,  like our author, unite the qualities of the writer and the sportsman;  from whom we look to learn in what respects the habits and characters  of northern fish differ from our own, and thus supply the deficiency  of the work before us. The title of this work is rather too general.  The author's knowledge of the fish, and of fishing, in the United  States, is almost wholly confined to the regions north of the  Chesapeake, and he falls into the error, quite too common to the  North, of supposing this region to be the whole country. Another  each volume as that before us will be necessary to do justice to the  Southern States, whose possessions, in the finny tribes of sea and  river, are of a sort to shame into comparative insignificance all the  boasted treasures of the North. It would need but few pages in our  review, from the proper hands, to render this very apparent to the  reader. Meanwhile, we exhort him to seek the book of Mr. Herbert, as a  work of much interest and authority, so far as it goes.\"           *       *       *       *       *    MR.

It is now half completed.           *       *       *       *       *    M. Max Schlesinger, author of \"The War in Hungary, in 1848-9,\"--a  work which, from what we read of it in the foreign journals, is much  the most striking and attractive of all that have appeared upon its  subject in English,--is described in the _Athenaeum_, as by birth  a Hungarian, by the accidents of fortune a German. For some time a  resident in Prague, and more recently settled in Berlin, he has had  excellent opportunities of seeing the men and studying the questions  connected both in the literary and political sense with the present  movement of ideas and races in Eastern Europe. His acquaintance  with the aspects of nature in his native land--his knowledge of the  peculiar character of its inhabitants, their manners, modes of thought  and habits of life--his familiarity with past history--his right  conception of the leading men in the recent struggle--are all vouched  for as \"essentially accurate\" by no less an authority than Count  Pulszky. It would be an injustice merely to say that M. Schlesinger  has given in an original and picturesque way a general view of the  course of events in the late war, more complete and connected than is  afforded in any account hitherto presented to the public. He has done  more: he has enabled the German and English reader to understand the  miracle of a nation of four or five millions of men rising up at the  command of a great statesman, and doing successful battle with the  elaborately organized power of a first-class European state, shaking  it to its very foundations, and contending, not without hope,  against two mighty military empires,--until the treachery from within  paralyzed its power of resistance.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Mayo's new novel, \"The Berber, or the Mountaineer of the Atlas,\"  published by Putnam, promises to be scarcely less popular than his  \"Kaloolah.\" The _Evening Post_ says of it: \"Kaloolah was a sprightly  narrative of the wanderings of a Yankee, who seemed to combine in  his person the characteristics of Robinson Crusoe with those of Baron  Munchausen; but the Berber professes to be nothing more than a novel;  or, as the author says in his preface, his principal object has been  to tell an agreeable story in an agreeable way. In doing so, however,  an eye has been had to the illustration of Moorish manners, customs,  history, and geography; to the exemplification of Moorish life as  it actually is in Barbary in the present day, and not as it usually  appears in the vague and poetic glamour of the common Moorish romance.  It has also been an object to introduce to the acquaintance of the  reader a people who have played a most important part in the world's  history, but of whom very few educated people know anything more than  the name. As Dr. Mayo has traveled extensively over the regions he  describes, we presume that his descriptions may be taken as true. His  account of the Berbers, a tribe of ancient Asiatic origin, who inhabit  a range of the Atlas, and who live a semi-savage life like the Arabs,  is minute, and to the intelligent reader quite as interesting as the  more narrative parts of the work. It is, perhaps, the best evidence of  the merits of the book, that the whole first edition was exhausted by  orders from the country before the first number had appeared in the  city.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Col. Forbes, who was in Italy during the revolution, and many years  previous, and who was himself, both in a military and civic capacity,  one of the actors in that event, the _Evening Post_ informs us, is  about to give public lectures on the subject of Italy in the various  cities and towns of the United States. Col. Forbes was intimately  connected with the revolutionary chiefs during the brief existence  of the Roman Republic, and was directly and confidently employed by  Mazzini. His knowledge of the country, its people, its politics, and  its recent history, will supply him with materials for making his  lectures highly interesting and instructive.           *       *       *       *       *    The Gem of the Western World, edited by Mrs. Hewitt, and published by  Cornish & Co., Fulton street, is a very beautiful gift-book, and in  its literary character is deserving of a place with the most splendid  and; tasteful annuals of the season. Mrs. Hewitt's own contributions  to it embrace some of her finest compositions, and are of course among  its most brilliant contents.           *       *       *       *       *    FRENCH PERIODICALS.--A Parisian correspondent of the London _Literary  Gazette_ observes, that if we exclude the _Revue des Deux Mondes_--a,  sort of cross between the English _Quarterly_ and the monthlies,--if  we exclude also a few dry scientific periodicals, and one or two  theatrical or musical newspapers, we shall seek in vain for any  _Quarterly_, or _Blackwood_, or _Art Union_, or _Literary Gazette_;  and that even the periodicals and journals which make the nearest  approach to the weekly, monthly, or quarterly publications of England,  are either wretched compilations, or abominably ill-written and  ill-printed. The _feuilleton_ system of the newspapers is no doubt  the principal cause of the periodical literature being in such  an extremely low condition. But though literary and scientific  periodicals be, generally speaking, vile in quality, they can at least  boast of quantity. There are, it seems, not fewer than 300 of one  kind or another published in Paris alone. Among them are 44 devoted  to medicine, chemistry, natural science, &c.; 42, trade, commerce,  railways, advertisements; 34, fashions; 30, law; 22, administration,  public works, roads, bridges, mines; 19, archaeology, history,  biography, geography, numismatics; 19, public instruction and  education; 15, agriculture and horticulture; 8, bibliography and  typography; 10, army and navy; 7, literary; the rest theatrical,  musical, or of a character too hybrid to be classified.           *       *       *       *       *    THE ILLUSTRATED DOMESTIC BIBLE, edited by the Rev. Ingram Cobbin,  seems to us decidedly the best family Bible ever offered to the trade  in this country. It is printed with remarkable correctness and beauty;  illustrated with a very large number of maps and engravings on wood;  and its notes, written with much condensation and perspicuity, are  such as are necessary for the understanding of the text. Indeed, all  that is added to the letter of the Bible is legitimate and necessary  _illustration_. It is being published in a series of twenty-five  numbers, at twenty-five cents each, by S. Hueston, publisher of _The  Knickerbocker_, Nassau-street.           *       *       *       *       *    THE VIENNA UNIVERSITY, long one of the best in Europe, has not been  reopened since the insurrection of November, 1848, its principal  edifice having been occupied as barracks for a regiment of soldiers.  It is now proposed to restore it to its proper use, but great  difficulty is experienced in finding professors. The old ones  are scattered, some as exiles in foreign countries, on account of  democratic opinions,--some in prison for the same reason, others  employed elsewhere. Wackernagel, the eminent professor of the German  Language and Literature at Basle, Switzerland, tempted by liberal  offers, had promised to come to Vienna, and lend the aid of his  reputation and talents to the restoration of the University, but being  lately at Milan, on a wedding tour, as he and his wife were passing  through the _Piazza d'Armi_, their ears were saluted by cries of  pain, which on inquiry they found to proceed from sundry rebellious  Italians, of both sexes, who were receiving each from twenty-five to  fifty blows of the military baton, or cane, employed by the Austrians  in flogging soldiers. Madame Wackernagel at once declared that she  would never willingly inhabit a country whose laws and habits suffered  women to be so brutally punished for patriotism, and her husband could  only agree with her. He has accordingly broken off the engagement, and  the Government cannot hope to supply his place.           *       *       *       *       *    HINCKS ON LITERARY LARCENY.--A Canadian friend sends us the following  extract from a speech by Francis Hincks, a leading member of the  Canadian Ministry, touching the International Copyright question:        \"The American publisher steals the works of British authors,      because he is immoral enough to do it, because he is scoundrel      enough, and the nation is scoundrel enough to permit it.      (Ironical cheers.) Yes, because the nation is scoundrel enough      to permit it.\"    Our unknown friend who sends us this wants us to give Hincks a  thorough roasting for it, and evidently expects every hair on our head  to bristle with indignation. Now we have not the least objection to  roasting the Minister aforesaid, and will do it when a fair chance  presents itself, but we don't consider this such a chance. In fact,  though we think Francis has drawn rather a strong draught from \"the  well of English undefiled,\" yet essentially we regard his observations  above quoted as rather more than half right. It _is_ rascally to steal  a man's book, print it, sell it, read it, and refuse him any pay for  the labor of writing it; and we don't see that his being an Englishman  makes any material difference. There may be a cheaper way to get the  proceeds of another man's toil than by paying for it, but we don't  think there is any other strictly honest way.--_Tribune_.           *       *       *       *       *    HERR SCHUMANN's opera, \"Genevieve,\" was produced at Leipsic on the  28th ultimo. \"This work,\" says the _Gazette Musicale_, \"after having  been much recommended beforehand, does not seem to have satisfied  public expectation, being concert music,"]]]
