At the Democratic convention an anti woman suffragist spoke. The  applause in the gallery and in the standing groups filling the outside  aisles was uproarious and clearly represented an organized, carefully  planted claque. The leaders were an ex-brewer, an ex-saloonkeeper and  the chief liquor lobbyist of the state. It was evident that they were  there to intimidate the party, and they did. The Democrats threw  a bouquet to the women in the form of a plank and then quietly  repudiated it. Practically the same thing happened in the Republican  convention. They, too, endorsed a plank and \"double-crossed.\" There  was apparently no difference between the two dominant parties on that  score. Men who had always been pronounced suffragists weakly confessed  themselves afraid to speak for woman suffrage in the campaign lest  votes be lost for their party. Political campaigners who went into the  state, with the exception of Senator Borah and Raymond Robins, were  told not to mention suffrage, and they obeyed. The wets apparently had  the state literally by the throat and in order to save votes the great  fundamental principle of \"government by the people\" was refused a  public hearing. Election Day came. Women poll workers reported from  many parts of the state that drunken hoodlums were marched in line  into the precinct, saying boldly that they were going to vote \"agin  the ---- women.\" The women workers testified with remarkable unanimity  that their opposition was chiefly \"riffraff and illiterate negroes and  that it was under the direction of well-known 'wets.'\" Even an excise  commissioner under pay of the National Government worked against woman  suffrage all day in one precinct.    A premonition of what might happen appeared in September, when  Judge John M. Woods of the circuit court instructed a grand jury to  investigate the political situation in Berkely county. He declared, as  reported by the press, that election conditions had become intolerable  and that in his judgment one-third of the votes in the county were  purchasable. Elections, he said, had degenerated into \"an auction  wherein offices went to the highest bidder.\"    It was not surprising, therefore, that the cry of fraud arose from  many localities as soon as the election was over, and was so insistent  that the Governor called a special session of the Legislature for the  announced purpose of an investigation into the charges. Colonization,  bribery, repeating and every known form of corruption was alleged to  have been employed. One of the chief newspapers of the state declared  that the election scandals had surpassed all that had gone before.    The Legislature met but the Governor did not proceed with his proposed  investigation. No explanation was given, but to the onlooker it was  clear that one of two reasons, or perhaps both, was the cause of  silence on the part of the chief lawmaking body of the state--either  the lifted curtain would reveal \"the pot calling the kettle black,\" or  so extensive and noxious a mass of corruption was known to exist that  no means were available for correction of the wrongs perpetrated.    That money was used many women were willing to testify. For what  purpose it was used, who furnished it and who were the actual bribers  were questions not so readily answered. In one city it was reported  \"that warrants were out after the elect of the city and that this was  true in nearly every ward of the city.\" The warrants were based upon  the alleged use of money.    Other women poll workers reported that men boldly asked whether they  would be paid, and if so, how much. When they found there was no  reward for suffrage votes they scornfully but frankly confessed that  they could do better on the other side. Irregularities were numerous.  The amendment was ordered by the state officials printed on the main  ticket, but one county so far disobeyed instructions as to print the  amendment on a separate ballot, yet the vote was accepted. The returns  on the amendment were withheld for many days and in several counties  for weeks.    A few straws from the election show the way the wind blew in West  Virginia. In only four counties is the per cent, of illiteracy  among males of voting age less than 6 per cent. The returns in these  counties are found in the following table:    =================================================================  | Per Cent.  |        |  For     | Against  |                   |  | Illiteracy | County | Suffrage | Suffrage |                   |  | Voting Age |        | Amendment| Amendment|                   |  |   Males    |        |          |          |                   |  |------------+--------+----------+----------+-------------------|  |   5.5      | Brooke |   1,041  |     907  | Carried           |  |   5.8      | Morgan |     443  |   1,098  | 2-1/2 to 1 against|  |   4.7      | Ohio   |   4,513  |   6,014  | 1-1/3 to 1 against|  |   5.3      | Wood   |   3,260  |   3,960  | 1-1/4 to 1 against|  =================================================================    The returns from the five counties having the highest per cent. of  illiteracy are as follows:    ================================================================  | Per Cent   |        |  For     | Against  |                  |  | Illiteracy | County | Suffrage | Suffrage |                  |  | Voting Age |        | Amendment| Amendment|                  |  |   Males    |        |          |          |                  |  |------------+--------+----------+----------+------------------|  |    26.2    |Lincoln |    466   |  3,213   |7 to 1 against    |  |    26.4    |Boone   |    678   |  1,828   |3 lacking 6 votes |  |            |        |          |          |   to 1 against   |  |    27.7    |Logan   |    856   |  2,774   |3-1/4 to 1 against|  |    28.2    |Mingo   |    712   |  2,609   |3-2/3 to 1 against|  |    29.7    |McDowell|  1,436   |  4,832   |3-1/3 to 1 against|  ================================================================    In the first group the negro vote is under 5 per cent. of the whole.  In the second this is also true of Boone and Lincoln counties. The  number of negro males of voting age is nearly 6 per cent. in Logan  county, 11.2 per cent. in Mingo county and 34.1 per cent. in McDowell  county.    It is a matter of interest to observe that the counties giving the  largest majority against were Clay, 6 to 1; Grant, 7 to 1; Hardy,  7-2/3 to 1; Lincoln, 7 to 1; Raleigh, 5 to 1, and that in none of  these is the negro male population of voting age in excess of 5 per  cent. White illiteracy is high, the lowest in this group being that  found in Grant county, 13.3 per cent.    Had there been an honest election and a fair count in West Virginia,  it is possible, even probable, that woman suffrage would have been  defeated, but the fact remains that no human being can know that,  since the amendment went down to defeat in an election that can only  be described as \"The Shame of West Virginia.\"    In all three states the pending amendments were caught in the toils  of the \"wet and dry\" issue. The \"wets\" obsessed by the idea that woman  suffrage is \"next door to prohibition\" used their entire machinery  to defeat the amendments, while the \"drys\" regarded the amendments as  distinctly separate questions. These conditions may be regarded as  the inevitable hazards of a campaign. It is, however, not at all clear  that the amendments were defeated in any one of the three states  by the honest \"will of the majority.\" In none of them were women  permitted to serve as watchers over their amendment. In Iowa well  established proof of wilful or careless violations of laws throws  doubt over the returns, while in West Virginia the suspicion of fraud  rests upon the entire election. In Iowa four and in South Dakota nine  counties colonized by people of foreign birth or parentage deprived  the women of the state of their vote.    A Federal amendment ratified by the legislatures of the several states  would secure to the women of South Dakota and Iowa the rights for  which American and Americanized men have voted. The entire western  or most American part of South Dakota has been twice carried for  suffrage, that is, in 1914 and 1916. One county, Harding, adjacent to  Wyoming, has been carried for woman suffrage in the six referenda on  the question, the first one being held in 1890.    The only real argument against the Federal amendment thus far advanced  is that one group of states which want woman suffrage may force it  upon another group which does not want it. That argument works both  ways. _A group of counties_ which want woman suffrage may be deprived  of it for years because another group of un-Americanized, foreign-born  citizens do not want it. The first is said to be the principle of  \"American sovereignty,\" the second may fairly be called the principle  of \"foreign sovereignty.\"          CHAPTER V.    FEDERAL ACTION AND STATE RIGHTS    HENRY WADE ROGERS    Judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, New York City,  and Professor in the Yale University School of Law.      I do not propose to discuss the subject of woman suffrage in the  abstract. I am content with saying as regards the general question  that in a republic which theoretically is founded upon the principle  that government derives its just powers from the consent of the  governed I think it illogical, unreasonable and an injustice to deny  the vote to adult women who are citizens. With that statement I  shall address myself to the suggestion of the National American Woman  Suffrage Association that Congress should propose to the States an  amendment to the Constitution which shall in effect provide that no  State shall deny to any person the right to vote on account of sex.  And as respects that suggestion I shall deal with a single phase of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13575"],[0,"How to Observe in Archaeology (#7)"],[1,"them being too slender, and the  possibilities too wide. Nevertheless, coins when found should be  carefully quoted. Pottery naturally takes the largest place, as it  was abundant, and its fragments are a good guide to period, and being  practically indestructible and of no intrinsic value are most likely  to be met with. The difference between pottery made with the use of  the wheel and that made without is important to be noted. The use of  the wheel can usually be detected through the slight inequalities of  the clay that make a series of parallel lines on the inner surface.  The diagrammatic representations of the pot-forms characteristic of  various periods or of other objects ranging through a civilization  the main features of which can be shown in outline will, it is hoped,  be found useful. Simplified tables of alphabets, intended to make it  possible roughly to identify the script, if not the date, of an  inscription, are also given.          CHAPTER I      FLINT IMPLEMENTS    See Diagrams, [Illustrations II: Flint Implements]    As the development of Flint Implements follows more or less the same  course in all the districts with which this volume deals, a general  description is given here, to avoid repetition in the special  sections.    The earlier periods of man are so remote that geological changes,  wet, and decay, have removed nearly all his works except the flint  tools. It is to these chiefly that we must look for our knowledge of  his abilities. Flints are nearly all that we have for the early  stages, to supply what arts, history, and literature give in later  stages. To preserve and educe all we possibly can obtain from their  situation, and purpose, is a main duty to history. To destroy or  confuse the evidence, by removing specimens without a record, or by  shifting them to a different place, is a crime in science. As there  is no temptation to ignorant peasants to move flints until they are  induced by collectors, so the whole fault of the wreckage that has  taken place in many sites lies on the plundering collector. No money  or reward should be given for any flints; a few fine specimens may be  lost, but vastly more harm would be done by encouraging mere raiding.    The periods and styles that are now recognized are shown on the  diagram--and their conditions were:          Style              Climate                 Sea level    Eolithic (Pliocene)      ?  Rostrocarinate (Crag)    ?  Strepyan                 warmer                  lower  Chellean                 warm                    low  Acheulian                cooler                  rising  Mousterian               cold                    high  Aurignacian              less cold               lower  Solutrean                warmer                  low  Magdalenian              colder                  rising  Neolithic                            as present      Differences of heat may be 20 degrees or 30 degrees + or -  Differences of level may be 600-800 ft. + or -    The information required of all observers is the level and conditions  of all flint tools that they may see or collect.    Gravels  containing tools may be surface gravels on a plateau; note then the  level, and the relation of them to any cliffs; do they end abruptly  at a cliff edge, showing that the valley was filled up; or do they  fade away to the edge, showing that they are older than the valley  erosion? Gravels may be the filling up of a valley which was  previously eroded; note the highest level at which they can be  traced; often little pockets of deposit, or traces of sandy strata,  can be found clinging high up on cliffs; also note the depths in the  gravel at which any tools are found. Any shells or bones in the  gravels are of the greatest value; the depth at which they are found  should be written on them at once, with the locality.    Surface flints  should have levels noted on them. If sharp they show that probably  submergence has not reached that level since; if worn, then water has  been up to a higher level, from which they have been washed down.    Levelling  may be read from a contour map, if there is such available. In most  countries it must be done by reading feet on an aneroid barometer,  set with zero of level scale to 30 ins. or 760 mm. Then visit as soon  as possible some point where a level is marked on the map, as a hill  top, and read the barometer. This will give the correction to be made  to all the previous notes. If there is no level recorded, get down to  a stream bed (the larger the better) and read it there, recording the  exact place on the map. The level may then be worked out  approximately by points above and below on the stream, for accurate  reading, hold the aneroid face up, gently tap it, and read; then face  down similarly, and take the mean. Guard that the wind does not blow  against any keyhole in the case.    Pencil all levels and localities on flints as soon as found. Ink in  the notes on the least prominent parts of the flint, in small capital  letters, when in camp, with waterproof China ink.    Styles of flint work.  The Eoliths are worn pebbles, chipped as if for scraping. The Rostro-  carinate flints found at the base of the Crag are long bars with a  beak-end, suited for breaking up earth. The human origin of both of  these classes is contested. Flints of Strepy type are nodular and  partly trimmed into cutting edges, the smooth surface being left as a  handle. The Chelles types are remarkable for regularity and fine bold  flaking; the worn butt (though best for handling) was eventually  flaked away to obtain an artistic uniform finish. The St. Acheul  series has finer flaking, the crust being completely removed: there  is a tendency to ovate or almond shapes, and the edges are often  curved, the reverse S-curve being preferred, They diminish in size  towards the end of the period. The Chelles and St. Acheul series are  core implements, made by detaching flakes; and the succeeding (Le  Moustier) method is to use the flakes, generally for scraping. The  LA, EM the diagram is transitional from St. Acheul to Le Moustier.  The form marked M is the predecessor of the Solutrean form next below  it. The Aurignacian is a smaller flake industry, with many lumps more  or less conical, and often with careful parallel flaking or fluting.  The Solutre culture brought in a new style, particularly thin blades  with delicate surface flaking which seems to have reappeared in the  late Neolithic. The pointed borers, certain arrow-heads and minutely  chipped rods of flint are characteristic of the period, and flints of  this age are found on the Egyptian and Syrian deserts. Longer blades,  sometimes very coarse, with ends worn by scraping, mark the period of  La Madeleine. They are found in prehistoric Egyptian graves, along  with Neolithic knives and lances. As a technical advance on flaking  by blows or pressure, grinding and incidental polishing of flint  implements are regarded as characteristic of the Neolithic period;  and the practice may have started in areas devoid of flint, where it  was necessary to utilize local material that could not be flaked like  flint. In Europe generally, polished celts belong to the Megalithic  or latest division of the Neolithic, but this implement appeared much  earlier, and in a sense succeeded the Palaeolithic hand-axe. The  latter is not known to have been hafted, and its working edges were  at the pointed end; whereas in Neolithic times the implement had  become an axe in the modern sense, with the pointed end inserted in a  haft, and the cutting edge removed to the broader end. There are many  other Neolithic types, used with or without a haft, and only a small  proportion were finished by grinding on sandstone.          CHAPTER II      GREECE    [See the diagrams of flint implements, [Illustration II] of pottery,  [Illustration III]; and of alphabets, [Illustration IV]]    The Periods into which the subject must be divided are roughly as  follows:       I.
