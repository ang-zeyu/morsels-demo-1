Bet you a dollar, Ned, that I'm off to Slumberland before  you are.\"    \"I don't take the bet,\" said Ned, \"but I'll run you an even race.\"    In exactly five minutes the two, rolled in their own blankets, slept  soundly. All the others soon followed, except four, who, unlike the  Mexicans, kept a watch that missed nothing.          CHAPTER III    THE FIGHT WITH URREA      Morning came. Up rose the sun, pouring a brilliant light over the  desolate plains. Beads of water from the rain the night before sparkled  a little while and then dried up. But the day was cold, nevertheless,  and a sharp wind now began to search for the weakest point of every one.  Ned, Obed and the Panther were up betimes, but some of the rescued still  slept.    Ned, at the suggestion of the Panther, mounted one of the horses and  rode out on the plain a half mile to the south. Those keen eyes of his  were becoming all the keener from life upon the vast rolling plains. But  no matter how he searched the horizon he saw only a lonesome cactus or  two shivering in the wind. When he returned with his report the  redoubtable Panther said:    \"Then we'll just take our time. The pursuit's goin' to come, but since  it ain't in sight we'll brace up these new friends of ours with hot  coffee an' vittles. I guess we've got coffee enough left for all.\"    They lighted the fire anew and soon pleasant odors arose. The rescued  prisoners ate and drank hungrily, and Mr. Roylston was able to limp a  little. Now that Ned saw him in the full daylight he understood more  clearly than ever that this was indeed a most uncommon man. The brow and  eyes belonged to one who thought, planned and organized. He spoke little  and made no complaint, but when he looked at Ned he said:    \"You are young, my boy, to live among such dangers. Why do you not go  north into the states where life is safe?\"    \"There are others as young as I, or younger, who have fought or will  fight for Texas,\" said Ned. \"I belong here and I've got powerful  friends. Two of them have saved my life more than once and are likely to  do so again.\"    He nodded toward Obed and the Panther, who were too far away to hear.  Roylston smiled. The two men were in singular contrast, but each was  striking in his way. Obed, of great height and very thin, but  exceedingly strong, was like a steel lath. The Panther, huge in every  aspect, reminded one, in his size and strength, of a buffalo bull.    \"They are uncommon men, no doubt,\" said Roylston. \"And you expect to  remain with them?\"    \"I'd never leave them while this war lasts! Not under any  circumstances!\"    Ned spoke with great energy, and again Roylston smiled, but he said no  more.    \"It's time to start,\" said the Panther.    Roylston again mounted one of the horses. Ned saw that it hurt his pride  to have to ride, but he saw also that he would not complain when  complaints availed nothing. He felt an increasing interest in a man who  seemed to have perfect command over himself.    The boy, Will Allen, was fresh and strong again. His youthful frame had  recovered completely from all hardships, and now that he was free,  armed, and in the company of true friends his face glowed with pleasure  and enthusiasm. He was tall and strong, and now he carried a good rifle  with a pistol also in his belt. He and Ned walked side by side, and each  rejoiced in the companionship of one of his own age.    \"How long have you been with them?\" asked Will, looking at Obed and the  Panther.    \"I was first with Obed away down in Mexico. We were prisoners together  in the submarine dungeon of San Juan de Ulua. I'd never have escaped  without him. And I'd never have escaped a lot more things without him,  either. Then we met the Panther. He's the greatest frontiersman in all  the southwest, and we three somehow have become hooked together.\"    Will looked at Ned a little enviously.    \"What comrades you three must be!\" he said. \"I have nobody.\"    \"Are you going to fight for Texas?\"    \"I count on doing so.\"    \"Then why don't you join us, and we three will turn into four?\"    Will looked at Ned, and his eyes glistened.    \"Do you mean that?\" he asked.    \"Do I mean it? I think I do. Ho, there, Panther! You and Obed, just a  minute or two!\"    The two turned back. Ned and Will were walking at the rear of the little  company.    \"I've asked Will to be one of us,\" said Ned, \"to join our band and to  share our fortunes, good or bad.\"    \"Can he make all the signs, an' has he rid the goat?\" asked the Panther  solemnly.    \"Does he hereby swear never to tell any secret of ours to Mexican or  Indian?\" asked Obed. \"Does he swear to obey all our laws and by-laws  wherever he may be, and whenever he is put to the test?\"    \"He swears to everything,\" replied Ned, \"and I know that he is the kind  to make a trusty comrade to the death.\"    \"Then you are declared this minute a member of our company in good  standin',\" said the Panther to Will, \"an' with this grip I give you  welcome.\"    He crushed the boy's hand in a mighty grasp that made him wince, and  Obed followed with one that was almost equally severe. But the boy did  not mind the physical pain. Instead, his soul was uplifted. He was now  the chosen comrade of these three paladins, and he was no longer alone  in the world. But he merely said:    \"I'll try to show myself worthy.\"    They were compelled to stop at noon for rather a long rest, as walking  was tiresome. Fields, who was a good scout, went back and looked for  pursuers, but announced that he saw none, and, after an hour, they  started again.    \"I'm thinkin',\" said the Panther, \"that Urrea has already organized the  pursuit. Mebbe he has pow'ful glasses an' kin see us when we can't see  him. He may mean to attack to-night. It's a lucky thing for us that we  can find timber now an' then.\"    \"It's likely that you're right about to-night,\" said Obed, \"but there's  no night so dark that it doesn't have its silver lining. I guess  everybody in this little crowd is a good shot, unless maybe it's Mr.  Roylston, and as we have about three guns apiece we can make it mighty  hot for any force that Urrea may bring against us.\"    They began now to search for timber, looking especially for some clump  of trees that also inclosed water. They did not anticipate any great  difficulty in regard to the water, as the winter season and the heavy  rains had filled the dry creek beds, and had sent torrents down the  arroyos. Before dark they found a stream about a foot deep running over  sand between banks seven or eight feet high toward the Rio Grande. A  mile further on a small grove of myrtle oaks and pecans grew on its left  bank, and there they made their camp.    Feeling that they must rely upon their valor and watchfulness, and not  upon secrecy, they built a fire, and ate a good supper. Then they put  out the fire and half of them remained on guard, the other half going to  sleep, except Roylston, who sat with his back to a tree, his injured  legs resting upon a bed of leaves which the boys had raked up for him.  He had been riding Old Jack and the horse had seemed to take to him, but  after the stop Ned himself had looked after his mount.    The boy allowed Old Jack to graze a while, and then he tethered him in  the thickest of the woods just behind the sleeping man. He wished the  horse to be as safe as possible in case bullets should be flying, and he  could find no better place for him. But before going he stroked his nose  and whispered in his ear.    \"Good Old Jack! Brave fellow!\" he said. \"We are going to have troublous  times, you and I, along with the others, but I think we are going to  ride through them safely.\"    The horse whinnied ever so softly, and nuzzled Ned's arm. The  understanding between them was complete. Then Ned left him, intending to  take a position by the bank of the creek as he was on the early watch.  On the way he passed Roylston, who regarded him attentively.    \"I judge that your leader, Mr. Palmer, whom you generally call the  Panther, is expecting an attack,\" said the merchant.    \"He's the kind of man who tries to provide for everything,\" replied Ned.    \"Of course, then,\" said Roylston, \"he provides for the creek bed. The  Mexican skirmishers can come up it and yet be protected by its banks.\"    \"That is so,\" said the Panther, who had approached as he was speaking.  \"It's the one place that we've got to watch most, an' Ned an' me are  goin' to sit there on the banks, always lookin'. I see that you've got  the eye of a general, Mr. Roylston.\"    The merchant smiled.    \"I'm afraid I don't count for much in battle,\" he said, \"and least of  all hampered as I am now. But if the worst comes to the worst I can sit  here with my back to this tree and shoot. If you will kindly give me a  rifle and ammunition I shall be ready for the emergency.\"    \"But it is your time to sleep, Mr. Roylston,\" said the Panther.    \"I don't think I can sleep, and as I cannot I might as well be of use.\"    The Panther brought him the rifle, powder and bullets, and Roylston,  leaning against the tree, rifle across his knees, watched with bright  eyes. Sentinels were placed at the edge of the grove, but the Panther  and Ned, as arranged, were on the high bank overlooking the bed of the  creek. Now and then they walked back and forth, meeting at intervals,  but most of the time each kept to his own particular part of the ground.    Ned found an oak, blown down on the bank by some hurricane, and as there  was a comfortable seat on a bough with the trunk as a rest for his back  he remained there a long time. But his ease did not cause him to relax  his vigilance. He was looking toward the north, and he could see two  hundred yards or more up the creek bed to a point where it curved. The  bed itself was about thirty feet wide, although the water did not have a  width of more than ten feet.    Everything was now quite dry, as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],[0,"Germany, The Next Republic? (#7)"],[1,"to ignore it.  The Foreign Office was inclined to listen to  President Wilson's arguments.  Even the people, while they were  enthusiastic for a submarine war, did not want to estrange America if  they could prevent it.  The von Tirpitz press bureau, which knew that  public opposition to its plan could be overcome by raising the cry that  America was not neutral in aiding the Allies with supplies, launched an  anti-American campaign.  It came to a climax one night when Ambassador  Gerard was attending a theatre party.  As he entered the box he was  recognised by a group of Germans who shouted insulting remarks because  he spoke English.  Then some one else remarked that America was not  neutral by shipping arms and ammunition.    The Foreign Office apologised the next day but the Navy did not.  And,  instead of listening to the advice of Secretary of State von Jagow, the  Navy sent columns of inspired articles to the newspapers attacking  President Wilson and telling the German people that the United States  had joined the Entente in spirit if not in action.          CHAPTER III    THE GULF BETWEEN KIEL AND BERLIN    At the beginning of the war, even the Socialist Party in the Reichstag  voted the Government credits.  The press and the people unanimously  supported the Government because there was a very terrorising fear that  Russia was about to invade Germany and that England and France were  leagued together to crush the Fatherland.  Until the question of the  submarine warfare came up, the division of opinion which had already  developed between the Army and Navy clique and the Foreign Office was  not general among the people.  Although the army had not taken Paris, a  great part of Belgium and eight provinces of Northern France were  occupied and the Russians had been driven from East Prussia.  The  German people believed they were successful.  The army was satisfied  with what it had done and had great plans for the future.  Food and  economic conditions had changed very little as compared to the changes  which were to take place before 1917.  Supplies were flowing into  Germany from all neutral European countries.  Even England and Russia  were selling goods to Germany indirectly through neutral countries.  Considerable English merchandise, as well as American products, came in  by way of Holland because English business men were making money by the  transaction and because the English Government had not yet discovered  leaks in the blockade.  Two-thirds of the butter supply in Berlin was  coming from Russia.  Denmark was sending copper.  Norway was sending  fish and valuable oils.  Sweden was sending horses and cattle.  Italy  was sending fruit.  Spanish sardines and olives were reaching German  merchants.  There was no reason to be dissatisfied with the way the war  was going.  And, besides, the German people hated their enemies so that  the leaders could count upon continued support for almost an indefinite  period.  The cry of \"Hun and Barbarian\" was answered with the battle  cry \"Gott strafe England.\"    The latter part of April on my first trip to the front I dined at Great  Headquarters (Grosse Haupt Quartier) in Charleville, France, with Major  Nicolai, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff.  The next day, in company with other correspondents, we were guests of  General von Moehl and his staff at Peronne.  From Peronne we went to  the Somme front to St. Quentin, to Namur and Brussels.  The soldiers  were enthusiastic and happy.  There was plenty of food and considerable  optimism.  But the confidence in victory was never so great as it was  immediately after the sinking of the _Lusitania_.  That marked the  crisis in the future trend of the war.    Up to this time the people had heard very little about the fight  between the Navy and the Foreign Office.  But gradually rumours spread.  While there was previously no outlet for public opinion, the  _Lusitania_ issue was debated more extensively and with more vigour  than the White Books which were published to explain the causes of the  war.    With the universal feeling of self confidence, it was but natural that  the people should side with the Navy in demanding an unrestricted  submarine warfare.  When Admiral von Bachmann gave the order to First  Naval Lieutenant Otto Steinbrink to sink the Lusitania, he knew the  Navy was ready to defy the United States or any other country which  might object.  He knew, too, that von Tirpitz was very close to the  Kaiser and could count upon the Kaiser's support in whatever he did.  The Navy believed the torpedoing of the Lusitania would so frighten and  terrorise the world that neutral shipping would become timid and enemy  peoples would be impressed by Germany's might on the seas.  Ambassador  von Bernstorff had been ordered by the Foreign Office to put notices in  the American papers warning Americans off these ships.  The Chancellor  and Secretary von Jagow knew there was no way to stop the Admiralty,  and they wanted to avoid, if possible, the loss of American lives.    The storm of indignation which encircled the globe when reports were  printed that over a thousand people lost their lives on the Lusitania,  found a sympathetic echo in the Berlin Foreign Office.  \"Another navy  blunder,\" the officials said--confidentially.  Foreign Office officials  tried to conceal their distress because the officials knew the only  thing they could do now was to make preparation for an apology and try  to excuse in the best possible way what the navy had done.  On the 17th  of May like a thunderbolt from a clear sky came President Wilson's  first Lusitania note.      \"Recalling the humane and enlightened attitude hitherto assumed by the  Imperial German Government in matters of international life,  particularly with regard to the freedom of the seas; having learned to  recognise German views and German influence in the field of  international obligations as always engaged upon the side of justice  and humanity;\" the note read, \"and having understood the instructions  of the Imperial German Government to its naval commanders to be upon  the same plane of human action as those prescribed by the naval codes  of other nations, the government of the United States is loath to  believe--it cannot now bring itself to believe--that these acts so  absolutely contrary to the rules and practices and spirit of modern  warfare could have the countenance or sanction of that great  government. . . .  Manifestly submarines cannot be used against  merchantmen as the last few weeks have shown without an inevitable  violation of many sacred principles of justice and humanity.  American  citizens act within their indisputable rights in taking their ships and  in travelling wherever their legitimate business calls them upon the  high seas, and exercise those rights in what should be a well justified  confidence that their lives will not be endangered by acts done in  clear violation of universally acknowledged international obligations  and certainly in the confidence that their own government will sustain  them in the exercise of their rights.\"      And then the note which Mr. Gerard handed von Jagow concluded with  these words:      \"It (The United States) confidently expects therefore that the Imperial  German Government will disavow the acts of which the United States  complains, that they will make reparation as far as reparation is  possible for injuries which are without measure, and that they will  take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of anything so obviously  subversive of the principles of warfare, for which the Imperial German  Government in the past so wisely and so firmly contended.  The  Government and people of the United States look to the Imperial German  Government for just, prompt and enlightened action in this vital  matter. . . .  Expressions of regret and offers of reparation in the  case of neutral ships sunk by mistake, while they may satisfy  international obligations if no loss of life results, cannot justify or  excuse a practice, the natural necessary effect of which is to subject  neutral nations or neutral persons to new and immeasurable risks.  The  Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United  States to omit any word, or any act, necessary to the performance of  its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its  citizens, and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\"      Never in history had a neutral nation indicted another as the United  States did Germany in its first _Lusitania_ note without immediately  going to war.  Because the Foreign Office feared the reaction it might  have upon the people, the newspapers were not permitted to publish the  text until the press bureaus of the Navy and the Foreign Office had  mobilised the editorial writers and planned a publicity campaign to  follow the note's publication.  But the Navy and Foreign Office could  not agree on what should be done.  The Navy wanted to ignore Wilson.  Naval officers laughed at President Wilson's impertinence and, when the  Foreign Office sent to the Admiralty for all data in possession of the  Navy Department regarding the sinking of the _Lusitania_ the Navy  refused to acknowledge the request.    During this time I was in constant touch with the Foreign Office and  the American Embassy.  Frequently I went to the Navy Department but was  always told they had nothing to say.  When it appeared, however, that  there might he a break in diplomatic relations over the Lusitania the  Kaiser called the Chancellor to Great Headquarters for a conference.  Meanwhile Germany delayed her reply to the American note because the  Navy and Foreign Office were still at loggerheads.  On the 31st of May  von Jagow permitted me to quote him in an interview saying:      \"America can hardly expect us to give up any means at our disposal to  fight our enemy.  It is a"]]]
