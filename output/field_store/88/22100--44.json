V.        They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,--          To a land all covered with trees:      And they bought an owl, and a useful cart,          And a pound of rice, and a cranberry-tart,      And a hive of silvery bees;      And they bought a pig, and some green jackdaws,      And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws,      And forty bottles of ring-bo-ree,          And no end of Stilton cheese.

VI.        And in twenty years they all came back,--          In twenty years or more;      And every one said, \"How tall they've grown!          For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,      And the hills of the Chankly Bore.\"      And they drank their health, and gave them a feast      Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;      And every one said, \"If we only live,      We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,          To the hills of the Chankly Bore.\"              Far and few, far and few,          Are the lands where the Jumblies live:              Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;          And they went to sea in a sieve.          THE NUTCRACKERS AND THE SUGAR-TONGS.    [Illustration]                         I.        The Nutcrackers sate by a plate on the table;          The Sugar-tongs sate by a plate at his side;      And the Nutcrackers said, \"Don't you wish we were able          Along the blue hills and green meadows to ride?      Must we drag on this stupid existence forever,          So idle and weary, so full of remorse,      While every one else takes his pleasure, and never          Seems happy unless he is riding a horse?                           II.        \"Don't you think we could ride without being instructed,          Without any saddle or bridle or spur?      Our legs are so long, and so aptly constructed,          I'm sure that an accident could not occur.      Let us all of a sudden hop down from the table,          And hustle downstairs, and each jump on a horse!      Shall we try? Shall we go? Do you think we are able?\"          The Sugar-tongs answered distinctly, \"Of course!\"                           III.        So down the long staircase they hopped in a minute;          The Sugar-tongs snapped, and the Crackers said \"Crack!\"      The stable was open; the horses were in it:          Each took out a pony, and jumped on his back.      The Cat in a fright scrambled out of the doorway;          The Mice tumbled out of a bundle of hay;      The brown and white Rats, and the black ones from Norway,          Screamed out, \"They are taking the horses away!\"                           IV.        The whole of the household was filled with amazement:          The Cups and the Saucers danced madly about;      The Plates and the Dishes looked out of the casement;          The Salt-cellar stood on his head with a shout;      The Spoons, with a clatter, looked out of the lattice;          The Mustard-pot climbed up the gooseberry-pies;      The Soup-ladle peeped through a heap of veal-patties,          And squeaked with a ladle-like scream of surprise.                           V.        The Frying-pan said, \"It's an awful delusion!\"          The Tea-kettle hissed, and grew black in the face;      And they all rushed downstairs in the wildest confusion          To see the great Nutcracker-Sugar-tong race.      And out of the stable, with screamings and laughter          (Their ponies were cream-colored, speckled with brown),      The Nutcrackers first, and the Sugar-tongs after;          Rode all round the yard, and then all round the town.                           VI.        They rode through the street, and they rode by the station;          They galloped away to the beautiful shore;      In silence they rode, and \"made no observation,\"          Save this: \"We will never go back any more!\"      And still you might hear, till they rode out of hearing,          The Sugar-tongs snap, and the Crackers say \"Crack!\"      Till, far in the distance their forms disappearing,          They faded away; and they never came back!          CALICO PIE.    [Illustration]                         I.          Calico pie,        The little birds fly      Down to the calico-tree:        Their wings were blue,        And they sang \"Tilly-loo!\"        Till away they flew;          And they never came back to me!            They never came back,            They never came back,          They never came back to me!                           II.          Calico jam,        The little Fish swam      Over the Syllabub Sea.        He took off his hat        To the Sole and the Sprat,        And the Willeby-wat:          But he never came back to me;            He never came back,            He never came back,          He never came back to me.                   [Illustration]                           III.          Calico ban,        The little Mice ran      To be ready in time for tea;        Flippity flup,        They drank it all up,        And danced in the cup:          But they never came back to me;            They never came back,            They never came back,          They never came back to me.                   [Illustration]                           IV.          Calico drum,        The Grasshoppers come,      The Butterfly, Beetle, and Bee,        Over the ground,        Around and round,        With a hop and a bound;          But they never came back,            They never came back,            They never came back.          They never came back to me.                   [Illustration]          MR. AND MRS. SPIKKY SPARROW.    [Illustration]                         I.        On a little piece of wood      Mr. Spikky Sparrow stood:      Mrs. Sparrow sate close by,      A-making of an insect-pie      For her little children five,      In the nest and all alive;      Singing with a cheerful smile,      To amuse them all the while,         \"Twikky wikky wikky wee,          Wikky bikky twikky tee,              Spikky bikky bee!\"                           II.        Mrs. Spikky Sparrow said,      \"Spikky, darling! in my head      Many thoughts of trouble come,      Like to flies upon a plum.      All last night, among the trees,      I heard you cough, I heard you sneeze;      And thought I, 'It's come to that      Because he does not wear a hat!'          Chippy wippy sikky tee,          Bikky wikky tikky mee,              Spikky chippy wee!                           III.        \"Not that you are growing old;      But the nights are growing cold.      No one stays out all night long      Without a hat: I'm sure it's wrong!\"      Mr. Spikky said, \"How kind,      Dear, you are, to speak your mind!      All your life I wish you luck!      You are, you are, a lovely duck!          Witchy witchy witchy wee,          Twitchy witchy witchy bee,              Tikky tikky tee!                           IV.        \"I was also sad, and thinking,      When one day I saw you winking,      And I heard you sniffle-snuffle,      And I saw your feathers ruffle:      To myself I sadly said,      'She's neuralgia in her head!      That dear head has nothing on it!      Ought she not to wear a bonnet?'          Witchy kitchy kitchy wee,          Spikky wikky mikky bee,              Chippy wippy chee!                           V.        \"Let us both fly up to town:      There I'll buy you such a gown!      Which, completely in the fashion,      You shall tie a sky-blue sash on;      And a pair of slippers neat      To fit your darling little feet,      So that you will look and feel      Quite galloobious and genteel.          Jikky wikky bikky see,          Chicky bikky wikky bee,              Twicky witchy wee!\"                           VI.        So they both to London went,      Alighting on the Monument;      Whence they flew down swiftly--pop!      Into Moses' wholesale shop:      There they bought a hat and bonnet,      And a gown with spots upon it,      A satin sash of Cloxam blue,      And a pair of slippers too.          Zikky wikky mikky bee,          Witchy witchy mitchy kee,              Sikky tikky wee!                           VII.        Then, when so completely dressed,      Back they flew, and reached their nest.      Their children cried, \"O ma and pa!      How truly beautiful you are!\"      Said they, \"We trust that cold or pain      We shall never feel again;      While, perched on tree or house or steeple,      We now shall look like other people.          Witchy witchy witchy wee,          Twikky mikky bikky bee,              Zikky sikky tee!\"                   [Illustration]          THE BROOM, THE SHOVEL, THE POKER, AND THE TONGS.    [Illustration]                         I.        The Broom and the Shovel, the Poker and Tongs,        They all took a drive in the Park;      And they each sang a song, ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!        Before they went back in the dark.      Mr. Poker he sate quite upright in the coach;        Mr. Tongs made a clatter and clash;      Miss Shovel was dressed all in black (with a brooch);        Mrs. Broom was in blue (with a sash).          Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!          And they all sang a song.                           II.       \"O Shovely so lovely!\" the Poker he sang,       \"You have perfectly conquered my heart.      Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong! If you're pleased with my song,        I will feed you with cold apple-tart.      When you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,        You enrapture my life with delight,      Your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,        And your shape is so slender and bright!

The \"I\" is always the same, but  its apparent growth is the result of the mental unfoldment of the  individual. As we described it in one of the lessons of the \"_Advanced  Course_\" it is like an electric lamp that is encased in many wrappings of  cloth. As cloth after cloth is removed, the light seems to grow brighter  and stronger, and yet it has changed not, the change being in the removal  of the confining and bedimming coverings. We do not expect to make you  realize the \"I\" in all its fullness--that is far beyond the highest known  to man of to-day--but we do hope to bring you to a realization of the  highest conception of the \"I,\" possible to each of you in your present  stage of unfoldment, and in the process we expect to cause to drop from  you some of the confining sheaths that you have about outgrown. The  sheaths are ready for dropping, and all that is required is the touch of  a friendly hand to cause them to fall fluttering from you. We wish to  bring you to the fullest possible (to you) realization of the \"I,\" in  order to make an Individual of you--in order that you may understand, and  have courage to take up the tools and instruments lying at your hand, and  do the work before you.    And now, back to the Mental Drill. After you have satisfied yourself that  about everything that you are capable of thinking about is a \"not I\"  thing--a tool and instrument for your use--you will ask, \"And now, what  is there left that should not be thrown in the \"not I\" collection.\" To  this question we answer \"THE 'I' ITSELF.\" And when you demand a proof  we say, \"Try to set aside the 'I' for consideration!\" You may try from  now until the passing away of infinities of infinities, and you will  never be able to set aside the real \"I\" for consideration. You may think  you can, but a little reflection will show you that you are merely  setting aside some of your mental qualities or faculties. And in this  process what is the \"I\" doing? Simply setting aside and considering  things. Can you not see that the \"I\" cannot be both the _considerer_ and  the thing considered--the _examiner_ and the thing examined? Can the sun  shine upon itself by its own light? You may consider the \"I\" of some  other person, but it is _your_ \"I\" that is considering. But you cannot,  as an \"I,\" stand aside and see yourself as an \"I.\" Then what evidence  have we that there is an \"I\" to us? This: that you are always conscious  of being the considerer and examiner, instead of the considered and  examined thing--and then, you have the evidence of your consciousness.  And what report does this consciousness give us? Simply this, and nothing  more: \"I AM.\" That is all that the \"I\" is conscious of, regarding its  true self: \"I AM,\" but that consciousness is worth all the rest, for the  rest is but \"not I\" tools that the \"I\" may reach out and use.    And so at the final analysis, you will find that there is something that  refuses to be set aside and examined by the \"I.\" And that something is  the \"I\" itself--that \"I\" eternal, unchangeable--that drop of the Great  Spirit Ocean--that spark from the Sacred Flame.    Just as you find it impossible to imagine the \"I\" as dead, so will you  find it impossible to set aside the \"I\" for consideration--all that comes  to you is the testimony: \"I AM.\"    If you were able to set aside the \"I\" for consideration, who would be the  one to consider it? Who could consider except the \"I\" itself, and if it  be _here_, how could it be _there?_ The \"I\" cannot be the \"not I\" even in  the wildest flights of the imagination--the imagination with all its  boasted freedom and power, confesses itself vanquished when asked to do  this thing.    Oh, students, may you be brought to a realization of what you are. May  you soon awaken to the fact that you are sleeping gods--that you have  within you the power of the Universe, awaiting your word to manifest  in action. Long ages have you toiled to get this far, and long must you  travel before you reach even the first Great Temple, but you are now  entering into the conscious stage of Spiritual Evolution. No longer will  your eyes be closed as you walk the Path. From now on you will begin to  see clearer and clearer each step, in the dawning light of consciousness.    You are in touch with all of life, and the separation of your \"I\" from  the great Universal \"I\" is but apparent and temporary. We will tell you  of these things in our Third Lesson, but before you can grasp that you  must develop the \"I\" consciousness within you. Do not lay aside this  matter as one of no importance. Do not dismiss our weak explanation as  being \"merely words, words, words,\" as so many are inclined to do. We are  pointing out a great truth to you. Why not follow the leadings of the  Spirit which even now--this moment while you read--is urging you to walk  The Path of Attainment? Consider the teachings of this lesson, and  practice the Mental Drill until your mind has grasped its significance,  then let it sink deep down into your inner consciousness. Then will you  be ready for the next lessons, and those to follow.    Practice this Mental Drill until you are fully assured of the _reality_  of the \"I\" and the _relativity_ of the \"not \"I\" in the mind. When you  once grasp this truth, you will find that you will be able to use the  mind with far greater power and effect, for you will recognize that it is  your tool and instrument, fitted and intended to do your bidding. You  will be able to master your moods, and emotions when necessary, and will  rise from the position of a slave to a Master.    Our words seem cheap and poor, when we consider the greatness of the  truth that we are endeavoring to convey by means of them. For who can  find words to express the inexpressible? All that we may hope to do is to  awaken a keen interest and attention on your part, so that you will  practice the Mental Drill, and thus obtain the evidence of your own  mentality to the truth. Truth is not truth to you until you have proven  it in your own experience, and once so proven you cannot be robbed of it,  nor can it be argued away from you.    You must realize that in every mental effort You--the \"I\"--are behind it.  You bid the Mind work, and it obeys your Will. You are the Master, and  not the slave of your mind. You are the Driver, not the driven. Shake  yourself loose from the tyranny of the mind that has oppressed you for so  long. Assert yourself, and be free. We will help you in this direction  during the course of these lessons, but you must first assert yourself as  a Master of your Mind. Sign the mental Declaration of Independence from  your moods, emotions, and uncontrolled thoughts, and assert your Dominion  over them. Enter into your Kingdom, thou manifestation of the Spirit!    While this lesson is intended primarily to bring clearly into your  consciousness the fact that the \"I\" is a reality, separate and distinct  from its Mental Tools, and while the control of the mental faculties by  the Will forms a part of some of the future lessons, still, we think that  this is a good place to point out to you the advantages arising from a  realization of the true nature of the \"I\" and the relative aspect of the  Mind.    Many of us have supposed that our minds were the masters of ourselves,  and we have allowed ourselves to be tormented and worried by thoughts  \"running away\" with us, and presenting themselves at inopportune moments.  The Initiate is relieved from this annoyance, for he learns to assert his  mastery over the different parts of the mind, and controls and regulates  his mental processes, just as one would a fine piece of machinery. He is  able to control his conscious thinking faculties, and direct their work  to the best advantage, and he also learns how to pass on orders to the  subconscious mental region and bid it work for him while he sleeps, or  even when he is using his conscious mind in other matters. These subjects  will be considered by us in due time, during the course of lessons.    In this connection it may be interesting to read what Edward Carpenter  says of the power of the individual to control his thought processes. In  his book \"_From Adam's Peak to Eleplumta_,\" in describing his experience  while visiting a Hindu Gnani Yogi, he says:    \"And if we are unwilling to believe in this internal mastery over the  body, we are perhaps almost equally unaccustomed to the idea of mastery  over our own inner thoughts and feelings. That a man should be a prey to  any thought that chances to take possession of his mind, is commonly  among us assumed as unavoidable. It may be a matter of regret that he  should be kept awake all night from anxiety as to the issue of a lawsuit  on the morrow, but that he should have the power of determining whether  he be kept awake or not seems an extravagant demand. The image of an  impending calamity is no doubt odious, but its very odiousness (we say)  makes it haunt the mind all the more pertinaciously and it is useless to  try to expel it.    \"Yet this is an absurd position--for man, the heir of all the ages:  hag-ridden by the flimsy creatures of his own brain. If a pebble in our  boot torments us, we expel it. We take off the boot and shake it out.  And once the matter is fairly understood it is just as easy to expel an  intruding and obnoxious thought from the mind. About this there ought to  be no mistake, no two opinions. The thing is obvious, clear and  unmistakable. It should be as easy to expel an obnoxious thought from  your mind as it is to shake a stone out of your shoe; and till a man can  do that it is just nonsense to talk about his ascendancy over Nature, and  all the rest of it. He is a mere slave, and prey to the bat-winged  phantoms that flit through the corridors of his own brain.    \"Yet the weary and careworn faces that we meet by thousands, even among  the affluent"]]]
