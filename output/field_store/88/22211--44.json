ANONYMOUS          [Illustration]    AN INDIAN STORY--I    believe  tomahawks  signs  tongue      Many years ago two boys lived on a farm in New England.    It was so long ago that there were few white people in this country.    The farms were scattered, and around them were great forests.    The houses were made of logs, with strong, heavy doors.    Far away in the woods lived many Indians.    Sometimes the Indians would come down where the white people lived, and  would capture any white person whom they could find.    They even dared to attack, and often burned, the scattered log cabins.    The white prisoners would be taken to the Indian villages and would be  held there as captives.    One cold winter morning the two brothers, John and William, were going  skating on the river.    In order to reach the river, they had to pass through some woods.    John, the older brother, started first.    He threw his skates over his back and ran off whistling toward the  river.    William, the younger brother, had to stay behind to fill with wood the  huge box beside the fireplace.    Indians had not been seen near the farm for many years, so John was not  in the least afraid.    As he went through the woods toward the river two huge Indians, with  painted faces, jumped from behind the trees where they had been hiding.    Before John could run he was caught, and his hands were tied behind his  back.    Then they heard William shout as he ran down the path after his brother.    John knew that the Indians might kill him if he warned his brother.    But he was brave, and before they could stop him, he cried out,  \"Indians! Indians!\"    The Indians were angry and struck at John with their tomahawks.    But he was not afraid; he faced the Indians bravely.    William heard the shout of warning, and ran like a deer back to the log  cabin.    The heavy door was shut with a slam, and John's father, with his rifle,  waited for the Indian attack.    But the two Indians did not dare attack the log cabin.    Dragging John after them, they started up the river bank toward their  Indian town, many, many miles away.    All day long they traveled, and at night they built a small fire.    Over this fire they roasted a partridge which one of them had shot. John  was given his share of the bird and a handful of parched Indian corn.    The Indians looked at John's skates, which still hung over his shoulder.    They did not know what skates were. They thought they must be some of  the white man's magic.    On and on they traveled for many days, following an old Indian path.    All through the long march John still carried his skates.    At length they came to the Indian village.      AN INDIAN STORY--II    The Indian houses were long huts covered with strips of birch bark.    Four or five families lived in each of these houses.    John was given to an Indian woman who had lost her own boy the year  before.    John's Indian mother was good to him, and treated him as if he were her  own son.    One time the Indian boys thought they would test John's courage, so they  formed in two lines, while each boy held a stout stick.    Then they ordered John to run down between the two long lines.    They had their sticks all ready to beat him.    They thought John would be afraid and so would do as they told him.    But John was a strong lad, and jumping upon the first Indian boy, he  took his stick away from him.    [Illustration]    Armed with this stick, John struck right and left at the heads of the  boys until they were all glad to run away.    The Indian men liked to see John's courage, and laughed long and loud  when the Indian boys ran away.    After this the boys were glad to have John play with them.    With their bows and arrows they shot at a mark.    They swam in the river and played games of tag, hide and seek, and ball.    In the spring the Indian women planted the yellow corn.    When the corn was up, the squaws went into the fields to hoe out the  weeds. For a hoe they used a flat piece of stone tied to a wooden  handle.    As John was a white boy the squaws tried to make him help hoe the corn.    When John took the hoe, he hoed up the corn and left the weeds.    The angry squaws made signs to him that he must not do so.    Then John threw the hoe far from him.    \"Hoeing is fit for squaws, not for warriors,\" he shouted. He had learned  this from the Indian boys.    The old men were pleased. They thought John would make a fine warrior.      AN INDIAN STORY--III    John had lived with the Indians a year.    He had learned to speak their tongue, but they did not trust him.    Some of them were always with him, for they were afraid he would run  away.    All this time John had kept his skates carefully hidden.    One day the ice froze clear and smooth. John brought his skates down to  the river bank.    Many of the Indians followed to see what he was going to do.    They crowded around him on the ice.    John thought he would play a trick on them.    He strapped the skates upon the feet of an Indian boy.    The boy tried to stand up, but his feet slipped out from under him, and  down he bumped upon the ice.    How the Indians laughed!    They thought it was a great joke.    Each of them in turn tried on the skates.    How they sprawled and fell upon the ice!    What fun it was for the other Indians!    When they were tired of the sport they held out the skates to John and  asked him to put them on.    John strapped on the skates with great care. He was a good skater, but  he made believe that he could not skate at all.    He fell down and bumped his head.    He tripped over his toes and made great fun for the Indians.    They did not see that each time he fell he was a little farther out on  the ice.    All at once John jumped up.    Away he flew, skating for his life.    Down the river he went, swift as a bird.    The Indians rushed after him, but he had too great a start.    [Illustration]    The Indians were swift runners, but John, on his skates, was swifter  still.    He knew that the river must flow toward the ocean, and that near the  ocean lived the white people.    On and on he skated.    Two days later he saw the smoke of a white man's cabin and knew that he  was safe.    John soon found his father and mother.    How glad they were to see him!              A GOOD PLAY        We built a ship upon the stairs,      All made of the back-bedroom chairs,      And filled it full of sofa pillows,      To go a-sailing on the billows.        We took a saw and several nails,      And water in the nursery pails;      And Tom said, \"Let us also take      An apple and a slice of cake,\"--      Which was enough for Tom and me      To go a-sailing on, till tea.        We sailed along for days and days,      And had the very best of plays;      But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,      So there was no one left but me.        ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON          [Illustration]    DICK WHITTINGTON--I      Dick Whittington was a poor little boy who lived in the country.    His father and mother were both dead.    Poor little Dick was always willing to work, but sometimes there was no  work for him to do, so he often had nothing to eat.    Now Dick was a bright boy.    He kept both ears open to hear what was said around him.    He had heard many times about the great city of London.    Men said that in this great city the people were rich.    Dick had even heard that the streets were paved with gold.    \"How I should like to visit that great city,\" thought Dick, \"for I could  pick up gold from the streets!\"    Dick had earned a little money, so one day he set out to walk to London.    He walked and walked and walked, but London was a long way from his  home.    At last a man with a wagon came along. He was a kind man, and he gave  Dick a ride.    \"Where are you going?\" asked Dick.    \"I'm going to London,\" said the man.    \"You are very good to give me a ride. I am going there, too,\" said Dick.    It was dark when they reached London.    That night Dick slept in a barn with the horses.    The next morning he looked for the golden stones in the streets.

The  grand sculptures wherewith a king strove to perpetuate the memory of his  warlike exploits were travestied by satirists, who reproduced the scenes  upon papyrus as combats between cats and rats. The amorous follies of  the monarch were held up to derision by sketches of a harem interior,  where the kingly wooer was represented by a lion, and his favourites of  the softer sex by gazelles. Even in serious scenes depicting the trial  of souls in the next world, the sense of humour breaks out, where the  bad man, transformed into a pig or a monkey, walks off with a comical  air of surprise and discomfiture.    It does not, however, help us much towards the true knowledge of a  people to scan their frames or study their facial angle, or even to  contemplate the outer aspect of their daily life. We want to know their  thoughts, their innermost feelings, their hopes, their fears--in a word,  their belief. Nothing tells the character of a people so much as their  religion; and we are only dealing superficially with the outward shows  of things until we get down to the root of their being, the conviction,  or convictions, held in the recesses of a people's heart. What, then,  was the Egyptian religion? What did they worship? What did they  reverence? What future did they look forward to?    Enter the huge courts of an Egyptian temple, or temple-palace, and you  will see portrayed upon its lofty walls row upon row of deities. Here  the king makes his offering to Ammon, Maut, Khons, Neith, Mentu, Shu,  Seb, Nut, Osiris, Set, Horus; there he pours a libation to Phthah,  Sekhet, Tum, Pasht, Anuka, Thoth, Anubis; elsewhere, it may be, he pays  his court to Sati, Khem, Isis, Nephthys, Athor, Harmachis, Nausaas, and  Nebhept. One monarch erects an altar to Satemi, Tum, Khepra, Shu,  Tefnut, Seb, Netpe, Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys, Horus, and Thoth,  mentioning on the same monument Phthah, Num, Sabak, Athor, Pasht, Mentu,  Neith, Anubis, Nishem, and Kartak. Another represents himself on a  similar object as offering adoration to Ammon, Khem, Phthah-Sokari, Seb,  Nut, Thoth, Khons, Osiris, Isis, Horus, Athor, Uat (Buto), Neith,  Sekhet, Anata, Nuneb, Nebhept, and Hapi. All these deities are  represented by distinct forms, and have distinct attributes. Nor do they  at all exhaust the Pantheon. One modern writer enumerates seventy-three  divinities, and gives their several names and forms. Another has a list  of sixty-three \"_principal_ deities,\" and notes that there were \"others  which personified the elements, or presided over the operations of  nature, the seasons, and events.\" The Egyptians themselves speak not  unfrequently of \"the _thousand_ gods,\" sometimes further qualifying  them, as \"the gods male, the gods female, those which belong to the land  of Egypt.\" Practically, there were before the eyes of worshippers some  scores, if not some hundreds, of deities, who invited their approach and  challenged their affections.    Nor was this the whole, or the worst. The Egyptian was taught to pay a  religious regard to animals. In one place goats, in another sheep, in a  third hippopotami, in a fourth crocodiles, in a fifth vultures, in a  sixth frogs, in a seventh shrew-mice, were sacred creatures, to be  treated with respect and honour, and under no circumstances to be slain,  under the penalty of death to the slayer. And besides this local  animal-cult, there was a cult which was general. Cows, cats, dogs,  ibises, hawks, and cynocephalous apes, were sacred throughout the whole  of Egypt, and woe to the man who injured them! A Roman who accidentally  caused the death of a cat was immediately \"lynched\" by the populace.  Inhabitants of neighbouring villages would attack each other with the  utmost fury if the native of one had killed or eaten an animal held  sacred in the other. In any house where a cat or a dog died, the inmates  were expected to mourn for them as for a relation. Both these and the  other sacred animals were carefully embalmed after death, and their  bodies were interred in sacred repositories.    The animal-worship reached its utmost pitch of grossness and absurdity  when certain individual brute beasts were declared to be incarnate  deities, and treated accordingly. At Memphis, the ordinary capital,  there was maintained, at any rate from the time of Aahmes I. (about B.C.  1650), a sacred bull, known as Hapi or Apis, which was believed to be an  actual incarnation of the god Phthah, and was an object of the highest  veneration. The Apis bull dwelt in a temple of his own near the city,  had his train of attendant priests, his harem of cows, his meals of the  choicest food, his grooms and currycombers who kept his coat clean and  beautiful, his chamberlains who made his bed, his cup-bearers who  brought him water, &c., and on fixed days was led in a festive  procession through the main streets of the town, so that the inhabitants  might see him, and come forth from their dwellings and make obeisance.  When he died he was carefully embalmed, and deposited, together with  magnificent jewels and statuettes and vases, in a polished granite  sarcophagus, cut out of a single block, and weighing between sixty and  seventy tons! The cost of an Apis funeral amounted sometimes, as we are  told, to as much as L20,000. To contain the sarcophagi, several long  galleries were cut in the solid rock near Memphis, from which arched  lateral chambers went off on either side, each constructed to hold one  sarcophagus. The number of Apis bulls buried in the galleries was found  to be sixty-four.    Nor was this the only incarnate god of which Egypt boasted. Another  bull, called Mnevis, was maintained in the great temple of the Sun at  Heliopolis, and, being regarded as an incarnation of Ra or Tum, was as  much reverenced by the Heliopolites as Apis by the Memphites, A third,  called Bacis or Pacis, was kept at Hermonthis, which was also an  incarnation of Ra. And a white cow at Momemphis was reckoned an  incarnation of Athor. Who can wonder that foreign nations ridiculed a  religion of this kind--one that \"turned the glory\" of the Eternal  Godhead \"into the similitude of a calf that eateth hay\"?    The Egyptians had also a further god incarnate, who was not shut up out  of sight like the Apis and Mnevis and Bacis bulls and the Athor cow, but  was continually before their eyes, the centre of the nation's life, the  prime object of attention. This was the monarch, who for the time being  occupied the throne. Each king of Egypt claimed not only to be \"son of  the Sun,\" but to be an actual incarnation of the sun--\"the living  Horus.\" And this claim was, from an early date, received and allowed.  \"Thy Majesty,\" says a courtier under the twelfth dynasty, \"is the good  God ... the great God, the equal of the Sun-God. ... I live from the  breath which thou givest\" Brought into the king's presence, the courtier  \"falls on his belly,\" amazed and confounded. \"I was as one brought out  of the dark; my tongue was dumb; my lips failed me; my heart was no  longer in my body to know whether I was alive or dead;\" and this,  although \"the god\" had \"addressed him mildly.\" Another courtier  attributes his long life to the king's favour. Ambassadors, when  presented to the king, \"raised their arms in adoration of the good god,\"  and declared to him--\"Thou art like the Sun in all that thou doest: thy  heart realizes all its wishes; shouldest thou wish to make it day during  the night, it is so forthwith.... If thou sayest to the water, 'Come  from the rock,' it will come in a torrent suddenly at the words of thy  mouth. The god Ra is like thee in his limbs, the god Khepra in creative  force. Truly thou art the living image of thy father, Tum.... All thy  words are accomplished daily.\" Some of the kings set up their statues in  the temples by the side of the greatest of the national deities, to be  the objects of a similar worship.    Amid this wealth of gods, earthly and heavenly, human, animal, and  divine, an Egyptian might well feel puzzled to make a choice. In his  hesitation he was apt to turn to that only portion of his religion which  had the attraction that myth possesses--- the introduction into a  supramundane and superhuman world of a quasi-human element. The chief  Egyptian myth was the Osirid saga, which ran somewhat as follows: \"Once  upon a time the gods were tired of ruling in the upper sphere, and  resolved to take it in turns to reign over Egypt in the likeness of men.  So, after four of them had in succession been kings, each for a long  term of years, it happened that Osiris, the son of Seb and Nut, took the  throne, and became monarch of the two regions, the Upper and the Lower.  Osiris was of a good and bountiful nature, beneficent in will and words:  he set himself to civilize the Egyptians, taught them to till the fields  and cultivate the vine, gave them law and religion, and instructed them  in various useful arts. Unfortunately, he had a wicked brother, called  Set or Sutekh, who hated him for his goodness, and resolved to compass  his death. This he effected after a while, and, having placed the body  in a coffin, he threw it into the Nile, whence it floated down to the  sea. Isis, the sister and widow of Osiris, together with her sister  Nephthys, vainly sought for a long time her lord's remains, but at last  found them on the Syrian shore at Byblus, where they had been cast up by  the waves. She was conveying the corpse for embalmment and interment to  Memphis, when Set stole it from her, and cut it up into fourteen pieces,  which he concealed in various places. The unhappy queen set forth in a  light boat made of the papyrus plant, and searched Egypt from end to  end, until she had"]]]
