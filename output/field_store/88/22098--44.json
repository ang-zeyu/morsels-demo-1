During the last forty years leading chemists have continued to  experiment with a view to the production of a gunpowder which should be  smokeless. But not until the last few years has any considerable degree  of success been attained.    To be smokeless, a gunpowder must yield only gaseous products of  combustion. None of the so-called smokeless powders are entirely  smokeless, although some of them are very nearly so.    The smoke of common black gunpowder is largely due to minute particles  of solid matter which float in the air. About one-half of the total  products of combustion of black gunpowder of ordinary composition  consists of potassium carbonate in a finely divided condition and of  potassium sulphate, which is produced chiefly by the burning in the air  of potassium sulphide, another production of combustion, as on the  outrushing gases it is borne into the air in a fine state of division.    Another cause for the smoke of gunpowder is the formation of small  liquid vesicles which condense from some of the products of combustion  thrown into the air in a state of vapor, in the same manner as vesicles  of aqueous vapor form in the air on the escape of highly heated steam  from the whistle of a locomotive.    Broadly speaking, an explosive compound is one which contains, within  itself, all the elements necessary for its complete combustion, and  whose heated gaseous products occupy vastly more space than the original  compound. Such compound usually consists of oxygen, associated with  other elements, for which it has great affinity, and from which it is  held from more intimate union, or direct chemical combination, under  normal conditions, by being in combination as well with other elements  for which it has less affinity, but which it readily gives up for the  stronger affinities when explosion takes place, the other elements  either combining with one another to form new compounds or being set  free in an uncombined state.    An explosive is said to detonate when the above changes take place  instantaneously, the action being transmitted with the speed of  electricity by a sort of molecular rhythm from molecule to molecule  throughout the entire substance of the compound.    An explosive is said to explode when the above changes do not occur  instantaneously throughout the whole substance, but whose combustion  takes place from the surface inward of the particles or grains of which  it is composed, thus requiring some definite lapse of time.    The elements of an explosive compound may be associated chemically as in  nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton, which are chemical compounds, being the  results of definite reactions. Or, an explosive may be a mere mechanical  mixture of different substances comprising the necessary elements, as is  ordinary black gunpowder, which is a compound of charcoal, sulphur and  saltpeter, the saltpeter supplying the necessary oxygen.    No gunpowder can be smokeless in which saltpeter or any oxygen-bearing  salt having a metallic base is employed, for when the salt gives up its  oxygen, the base combines with other elements to produce a sulphate, a  carbonate, or other salt, which, being solid, produces smoke. Therefore,  to be smokeless, a gunpowder must contain no other elements than oxygen,  hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon, and in such proportions that the  products of combustion shall be wholly gaseous. The nitric  ethers--gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine--constitute such explosive  compounds. These substances were formerly thought to be  nitro-substitution compounds, but are now known to belong to the  compound ethers of nitric acid.    Gun-cotton, discovered by Schonbein, in 1845, has since been looked upon  as the most promising material for a smokeless gunpowder, it being a  very powerful explosive and burning with practically no smoke. To-day,  gun-cotton, in some form or other, constitutes the base of substantially  all of the smokeless powders with which have been attained any  considerable degree of success.    Gun-cotton alone and in its fibrous state has been found to be too  quick, or violent, for propulsive purposes, such as use in firearms; as  under such conditions of confinement it is very likely to detonate and  burst the gun. However, if gun-cotton be dissolved in a suitable  solvent, which is capable of being evaporated out, such as acetone, or  acetate of ethyl, which are very volatile, it becomes, when thus  dissolved and dried, a very hard, horn-like, amorphous substance, which  may be used for a smokeless gunpowder. But this substance taken alone is  very difficult to mould or granulate, and the loss of expensive solvents  must necessarily be quite considerable.    When gun-cotton is reduced to a collodial solid, as above, and used as a  smokeless gunpowder, the grains must be made comparatively small to  insure prompt and certain ignition, and consequently the pressures  developed in the gun are apt to be too great when charges sufficiently  large are used to give desired velocities.    If, however, a compound be made of gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine, in  about equal parts, by means of a volatile solvent or combining agent,  such as one of the before mentioned, and the solvent evaporated out, we  obtain practically a new substance and one which, as regards its  explosive nature, is quite unlike either of its two constituents taken  alone. The nitro-glycerine, furthermore, being itself a solvent of  gun-cotton, much less of the volatile ether is necessary to render the  compound of an amorphous character. Being quite plastic this substance  may be wrought or moulded into any desired size or form of grain.    This simple compound of nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton, or with some  slight modifications, has been found, when properly granulated, to be  the most smokeless powder that has yet been discovered or invented. If  pure chemicals are employed in the manufacture, and the gun-cotton and  nitro-glycerine be made of the highest nitration and best quality, we  have a smokeless powder which will possess the following desirable  qualities:    1st. It is absolutely smokeless, that is, its products of combustion are  entirely gaseous.    2d. Its products of combustion are in no way deleterious or unpleasant.    3d. It is perfectly safe to manufacture, handle and transport. There is  no more danger of its exploding accidentally than there would be of an  explosion of shavings or sawdust; for, unless well confined and set off  with a strong primer, it will not explode at all. In the open its  combustion is so slow as to in no way resemble or partake of the nature  of an explosion.    4th. It is perfectly stable, and will keep any length of time absolutely  without undergoing any change whatever, under all conditions of  temperature or exposure to which gunpowder would ever be subjected.    5th. It is not hygroscopic, and may be soaked in water without being at  all affected by it.    6th. It will not corrode the cartridge case.    7th. It will not foul the gun.    8th. It is sure of ignition with a good primer, and may be made to burn  as slowly as desired by varying the character and size of the grains.  Indeed, it may be made to burn so slowly as to fail of complete  combustion before the bullet leaves the gun, and after firing several  rounds, partly burned pieces of the powder may be picked up in front of  the gun.    9th. In a shoulder arm, a velocity of 2,000 feet per second may be  imparted to the bullet with this powder, and with a pressure in the  chamber of the gun of not more than fifteen English tons. This is, of  course, when the gun, cartridge case, primer, and projectile are adapted  to the use of smokeless powder, and the granulation of the powder is  adapted to them.    If what I have here claimed for the above smokeless powder be true, it  would appear that it may be taken as really an ideal smokeless powder.  Why, then, has it not already been universally adopted? Surely such a  powder is just what every government is seeking. In reply to this, let  me say that, in order for the above compound to be an effective and  successful smokeless powder, with the manifestation of the many  desirable qualities which I have recited, a great many other conditions  are necessary, some of which I will mention. To arrive at the knowledge  that this compound would constitute the best smokeless powder has  required a great deal of experimenting. It was first thought that  gun-cotton colloid, without any nitro-glycerine, that is, gun-cotton  dissolved and dried, would burn more slowly, keep better, and give  better ballistics than it would if combined with nitro-glycerine. It was  also thought that gun-cotton of a high degree of nitration when made  into colloidal form would even then burn too quickly to be suitable for  use in firearms. Consequently, the first experiments were with low grade  gun-cotton, what is called collodion cotton, such as is employed in the  manufacture of celluloid. But, as this would not explode without the  addition of some oxygen-bearing element, various oxygen-bearing salts  were combined with it, such as nitrate of potassium, nitrate of ammonia,  nitrate of baryta, etc. Also a great many of the first smokeless powders  were made of low grade gun-cotton combined with nitro-glycerine in  varying proportions. These powders would often give very good results  when first made; but low grade gun-cotton or di-nitro-cellulose, as it  is called, is a very unstable compound, and these powders, after giving  very promising results, were found to be constantly undergoing change,  sooner or later resulting in complete decomposition.

Upon inquiry she learned that it was to be opened as Colored  School Number 2. She went immediately to William D. Wilkins, a member of  the board of education, who, impressed with the personality of the young  woman, escorted her to the office of superintendent of schools, Duane  Dotty. After some discussion of the matter Miss Richards filed an  application, assured that she would be notified to take the next  examination. At the appointed time she presented herself along with  several other applicants who hoped to obtain the position. Miss Richards  ranked highest and was notified to report for duty the following  September. Early one morning she proceeded to her private school in time  to inform her forty pupils of the desirable change and conducted them in  a body to their new home.    Miss Richards taught in this building until 1871, when by a liberal  interpretation of the courts, the schools were mixed by ignoring race  distinction wherever it occurred in the school laws of Michigan. She was  then transferred to the Everett School where she remained until last  June when she was retired on a pension after having served that system  half a century. Although she taught very few colored children she said  to a reporter several years ago:        \"I have never been made to feel in any way that my race has been a      handicap to me. Neither my pupils nor the teachers have ever shown      prejudice; I do not doubt that it exists; I shall be in Heaven long      before it has all disappeared, but I say it is with a colored      teacher as it is with a white one. Her work is the only thing that      counts. I have never been called before the board for a reprimand in      all my years of teaching. The methods have changed a good deal since      the time that I started in and it would be easy to lag behind, but I      try not to. It means continual reading and study to keep up with the      modern way of doing things, but I manage to do it, and when the time      comes that I cannot do my work in a satisfactory manner I want the      Board of Education to discharge me and get some one else.\"    In testimony to these facts one of the daily papers of Detroit wrote her  up in 1910, saying that she had kept her interest in modern pedagogic  methods, maintained a high standard of scholarship in her school, and  retained her sympathy with little children, who had rewarded her  devotion to her work with their appreciation and love. To show how well  she is loved by her pupils the writer was careful to state that these  children as a gay group often surrounded her on her way to school,  clinging to her hands, crowding about her as best they may, all  chattering and pouring out accounts of their little doings.  \"Frequently,\" says this writer, \"she is stopped on the street by grown  men and women who long ago were her pupils and who have remembered her,  though with the passing of the years, and the new classes of little ones  who come to her every term, she has forgotten them.\"[11] Many have been  accustomed to bring their children to the Everett School and speak of  how glad they will be when these little ones will be under the care of  their parents' former teacher.    Miss Richards estimates that in the years of school work, she has had in  her room an average of fifty pupils a term, although sometimes the  attendance overflowed to a much greater number. With eighty-eight terms  of teaching to her credit, the number of pupils who owe part of their  education to \"this gentle and cultured woman\" amounts well up into the  tens of thousands, enough to populate a fair-sized city.    We can not close this article with a better testimonial than the  following letter from one of her former pupils, the Honorable Charles T.  Wilkins, a lawyer and an influential white citizen, who addressed her on  the occasion of her retirement last June.      \"_My dear Miss Richards_: The friendship of so long standing between  your family and mine, and the high esteem in which, as an educator, a  woman, and a Christian, you were always held by my father the late  Colonel William D. Wilkins, lead me to take the liberty of writing to  _congratulate_ you upon the well-earned retirement from active work,  which I have just learned from the press that you contemplate after so  many years well spent in faithful service to our community. As a citizen  and one who has always been most interested in the education of our  youth, I wish to add my thanks to those which are felt, if not expressed  by the many who know of your devotion to and success in leading the  young in the way in which they should go.    \"Though your active participation in this work is about to cease, may  you long be spared as an example to those who follow you is the earnest  hope of    \"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,    (Signed) \"Charles T.
