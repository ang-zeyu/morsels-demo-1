The legislature is  composed of two bodies, the members of which are elected by the people.  In limited monarchies where one branch of the legislature is elective,  the other is an aristocratic body, composed of men of wealth and  dignity, as the British house of lords.    Sec.5. The executive department is intrusted with the power of executing,  or carrying into effect, the laws of the state. There is in this  department a governor, assisted by a number of other officers, some of  whom are elected by the people; others are appointed in such manner as  the constitution or laws prescribe. The powers and duties of the  governor of a state will be more particularly described in another  place.    Sec.6. The judicial department is that by which justice is administered to  the citizens. It embraces the several courts of the state. All judges  and justices of the peace are judicial officers; and they have power,  and it is their business to judge of and apply the law in cases brought  before them for trial. A more particular description of the powers and  duties of judicial officers, and the manner of conducting trials in  courts of justice, will be given elsewhere. (Chap. XVII-XX.)    Sec.7. Experience has shown the propriety of dividing the civil power into  these three departments, and of confining the officers of each  department to the powers and duties belonging to the same. Those who  make the laws should not exercise the power of executing them; nor  should they who either make or execute the laws sit in judgment over  those who are brought before them for trial. A government in which the  different powers of making, executing, and applying the laws should be  united in a single body of men, however numerous, would be little better  than an absolute despotism.    Sec.8. Again, the legislative department of the civil power is divided.  Under all our state constitutions, the legislature consists of two  branches, both of which must agree to a proposed measure before it  becomes a law; and in many of the states, it must also be approved by  the governor. This is making the chief executive officer a third branch  of the law-making power; and is not in accordance with the principle of  keeping the several departments of the civil power separate and distinct  from each other. The reason for this departure from the general  principle mentioned, will be stated in another chapter. (Chap. XI. Sec.16.)          Chapter IX.    State Legislatures--how constituted.        Sec.1. The legislature of every state in the union is composed of two  houses--a senate and a house of representatives. The latter, or, as it  is sometimes called, the lower house, in the states of New York,  Wisconsin, and California, is called the assembly; in Maryland and  Virginia, the house of delegates; in North Carolina, the house of  commons; and in New Jersey, the general assembly. In most of the  states, the two houses together are called _general assembly_.    Sec.2. The senate, as well as the other house, is a representative body;  its members being elected by the people to represent them. Why, then, is  only one of the two branches called the house of representatives?  Perhaps for this reason: Under the governments of the colonies, while  yet subject to Great Britian, there was but one representative assembly.  The other branch of the legislature was called a _council_, consisting  of a small number of men who were appointed by the king. After the  colonies became free and independent states, a senate was substituted  for the old council, and although it is an elective body, the other  house, being much more numerous, is called, by way of distinction, the  _house of representatives_.    Sec.3. Senators are chosen annually in the six New England states, namely,  Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and  Connecticut. In the other states they are elected for terms of two,  three, or four years. In most of the states in which senators are  elected for longer terms than one year, they are not all elected at the  same time. They are divided into classes; and those of one class go out  of office one year, and those of another class another year; so that  only a part of the senators are elected every year, or every two, or  three, or four years.    Sec.4. The senate, as distinguished from the house of representatives, is  sometimes called the upper house. It was designed to be a more select  body, composed of men chosen with reference to their superior ability,  or their greater experience in public affairs.    Sec.5. Senators are differently apportioned in different states. In some  states they are apportioned among the several counties, so that the  number to be elected in each county shall be in proportion to the number  of its inhabitants. In others they are elected by districts, equal in  number to the number of senators to be chosen in the state, and a  senator is elected in each district. The districts are to contain, as  nearly as may be, an equal number of inhabitants; and sometimes they  comprise several counties.    Sec.6. Representatives are apportioned among the counties in proportion to  the population in each. In some states they are elected in districts of  equal population, counties being sometimes divided in the formation of  districts. In the New England states, representatives are apportioned  among the towns. In about one-half of the states, they are elected  annually; in the others, (including-most of the southern and western  states,) they are elected every two years.    Sec.7. The different modes of apportioning members of the legislature have  in view the same object--equal representation; that is, giving a member  to the same number of inhabitants in one county or district as to an  equal number in another. But in some counties the population increases  more rapidly than in others. The representation then becomes unequal,  being no longer in proportion to population.    Sec.8. In order to keep the representation throughout the state as nearly  equal as possible; in other words, to secure to the people of every  county or district their just proportion of the representatives, the  constitution requires that, at stated times, the people of the state  shall be numbered, and a new apportionment of senators and  representatives be made among the several counties according to the  number of inhabitants in each county; or if the state is one in which  members of the legislature are chosen in districts, a new division of  the state is made into districts.    Sec.9. But the periods of time between the enumerations of the people, are  not the same in all the states. In some states the enumerations are made  every ten years; in others, shorter periods have been fixed, from eight  down to four years. This enumeration or numbering of the people is  called taking the census. _Census_ is from the Latin, and was used by  the ancient Romans to signify a declaration or statement made before the  censors by the citizens, containing an enumeration or register of  themselves, their wives, children, servants, and their property and its  valuation. In the United States, although the census sometimes includes  a similar register, the word usually means simply an enumeration of the  people.    Sec.10. The constitution also prescribes the qualifications of senators and  representatives. If, as qualifications for an elector, full age,  citizenship, and a considerable term of residence in the state and  county, are properly required, as we have seen, (Chap. VI. Sec.2-5,) they  must be at least equally necessary for those who make the laws. In no  state, therefore, are any but qualified electors eligible to the office  of senator or representative. In some states, greater age and longer  residence are required; and in some, the age and term of residence have  been still further increased in the case of senators. The property  qualification formerly necessary for members of the legislature, as well  as for voters, has been almost entirely abolished. (Chap. VI. Sec.8.)    Sec.11. If a member of the legislature dies, or resigns his office before  the expiration of the term for which he was chosen, the vacancy is  filled by the election of another person at the next general election,  or at a special election called for that purpose, or in such other  manner as the constitution may provide. But a person chosen to fill a  vacancy, holds the office only for the remainder of the term of him  whose place he was chosen to supply.          Chapter X.    Meetings and Organization of the Legislature.        Sec.1. The legislature meets as often as the constitution requires, to  enact such laws as may be necessary to promote the public welfare, and  to perform such other duties as are assigned to it by the constitution  and the laws. In about half of the states, sessions are held annually;  in the others biennially, or once in two years. A legislative session  includes the daily meetings of a legislature from the time of its first  assembling, to the day of final adjournment. Thus we say the session  commenced in January and ended in March. The word _session_ has  reference also to a single sitting, from the hour at which the members  assemble on any day, to the time of adjournment on the same day. Thus we  say, the legislature holds a daily session of four hours; or, it holds  two sessions a day, as the case may be.    Sec.2. Meetings of the legislature are held at a place permanently fixed by  the constitution; at which place the principal state officers keep their  offices. Hence it is called the _seat of government_, or perhaps more  frequently, the _capital_ of the state. _Capital_ is from the Latin  _caput_, the head, and has come to mean chief, or the highest. A capital  city is therefore the chief city of a state or kingdom.

I have done  nothing to prejudice your case nor could I possibly have known until  my interview this morning with Miss Merlin, that it was she in whom  the late Sir Marcus was interested.\"    \"H'm,\" said Gatton, but still rather dubiously, his frank, wide-open  eyes regarding me in that naive manner which was so deceptive.    \"All that I learned,\" I continued, \"is unequivocally at your disposal.  Finally I may tell you--and I would confess it to few men--that Miss  Merlin is a very old friend and might have been something more if I  had not been a fool.\"    \"Oh!\" said Gatton, and his expression underwent a subtle change--\"Oh!  That's rather awkward; in fact\"--he frowned perplexedly--\"it's damned  awkward!\"    \"What do you mean?\" I demanded.    \"Well,\" said he, \"I don't know what account Miss Merlin gave to you of  her relations with Sir Marcus--\"    \"Relations!\" I said hotly, \"the man was a mere acquaintance; she  hadn't even seen him, except from the stage, for some months past.\"    \"Oh,\" replied Gatton, \"is that so?\" He looked at me very queerly. \"It  doesn't seem to dovetail with the evidence of the stage-doorkeeper.\"    I felt myself changing color, and:    \"What, then, does the stage-doorkeeper assert?\" I asked.    Gatton continued to look at me in that perplexed way, and believing  that I detected the trend of his reflections:    \"Look here, Inspector,\" I said, \"let us understand one another.  Whatever may be the evidence of stage-doorkeepers and others, upon one  point you can be assured. Miss Merlin had nothing whatever to do with  this horrible crime. The idea is unthinkable. So confident am I of  this, that you can be perfectly open with me and I give you my word of  honor that I shall be equally frank with you. The truth of the matter  cannot possibly injure her in the end and I am as anxious to discover  it as you are.\"    Gatton suddenly extended his hand, and:    \"Good!\" he said. \"We understand one another, but how is Miss Merlin  going to explain this?\"    He drew a note-book from his pocket, turned over several leaves, and  then:    \"On no fewer than six occasions,\" he said, \"I have approximate dates  here, Sir Marcus sent his card to Miss Merlin's dressing-room.\"    \"I know,\" I interrupted him; \"he persecuted her, but she never saw  him.\"    \"Wait a minute. Last night\"--Gatton glanced at me sharply--\"Marie,  the maid, came down after Sir Marcus's card had been sent to the  dressing-room and talked for several minutes to the late baronet, just  by the doorkeeper's box, but out of earshot. That was at ten o'clock.  At eleven, that is after the performance, Sir Marcus returned, and  again Marie came down to see him. They went out into the street  together and Sir Marcus entered a cab which was waiting and drove off.  Miss Merlin left a quarter of an hour later.\"    Our glances met and a silence of some moments' duration fell between  us; then:    \"You suggest,\" I said, \"that Miss Merlin had arranged a rendezvous  with him and to save appearances had joined him there later?\"    \"Well\"--Gatton raised his eyebrows--\"what do _you_ suggest?\"    I found myself temporarily at a loss for words, but:    \"Knowing nothing of this,\" I explained, \"naturally I was not in a  position to tax Miss Merlin with it. Possibly you have done so. What  is her explanation?\"    \"I have not seen her,\" confessed Gatton; \"I arrived at her flat ten  minutes after she had gone out--with you.\"    \"You saw Marie?\"    \"Unfortunately Marie was also out, but I saw an old charwoman who  attends daily, I understand, and it was from her that I learned of  your visit.\"    \"Marie,\" I said, \"may be able to throw some light on the matter.\"    \"I don't doubt it!\" replied Gatton grimly. \"Meanwhile we have  sufficient evidence to show that Sir Marcus drove from the New Avenue  Theater to this house.\"    \"He may not have driven here at all,\" I interrupted; \"he may have  driven somewhere else and performed the latter part of his journey  here--\"    \"In the crate!\" cried Gatton. \"Yes, you are right; his body may  actually have been inside the crate at the time that you and Bolton  arrived here last night; for that would be fully an hour after Sir  Marcus left the stage-door.\"    \"But who can have rung up the police station last night?\" I cried,  \"and what can have been the object of this unknown person?\"    \"That we have to find out,\" said Gatton quietly; \"undoubtedly it  formed part of a scheme planned with extraordinary cunning; it was not  an accident or an oversight, I mean. The men who are assisting me  haven't been idle, for we have already learned some most amazing facts  about the case. I haven't yet visited the house myself, but I have  here the report of one of my assistants who has done so; also I have  the keys. The garage I will inspect more carefully later on.\"    He glanced quickly about the place before we left it, then, leaving  the door locked behind us, we walked along to the gate before which  the constable stood on duty, and from thence proceeded up the drive to  the front entrance. There was a deep porch supported by pillars and  densely overgrown with creeper. I noted, too, a heavy and unhealthy  odor as of decaying leaves, and observed that a perfect carpet of  these lay on the path. In the shade of the big trees it was  comparatively cool, but the heavy malarious smell did not please me  and I imagined that it must have repelled more than one would-be  lessee.    As we approached the porch I saw that the windows of the rooms  immediately left and right of it had been stripped of the agent's  bills, for I could see where fragments of paper still adhered to the  glass. There were no bills in the porch either; but when Gatton opened  the front door I uttered an exclamation of surprise.    We stood in a small lounge-hall. There was a staircase on the left and  three doors opened on to the hall. But although the Red House was  palpably unoccupied, the hall was furnished! There were some rugs upon  the polished floor, a heavy bronze club-fender in front of the grate,  several chairs against the walls and a large palm in a Chinese pot.    \"Why,\" I exclaimed, \"the place is furnished and the stairs are  carpeted too!\"    \"Yes,\" said Gatton, looking keenly about him, \"but according to report  if you will step upstairs you will get a surprise.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Well, suppose we go and see.\"    Gatton led the way and I followed up the stairs as far as the first  landing. Here I paused in amazement. For at this point all attempts at  furnishing ceased. The landing was quite bare and so were the stairs  above it! Seeing my expression of incredulous surprise:    \"Yes,\" said Gatton, smiling, \"it's a strange arrangement, isn't it?\"    We descended again to the furnished hall.    \"Look here,\" continued my companion.    He unlocked a door on the left, having tried several keys from the  bunch which he carried without success, but finally discovering the  right one.    A long rectangular room was revealed, evidently intended for a  dining-room. It was empty and unfurnished, odds and ends of newspaper  and other rubbish lying here and there upon the floor. My astonishment  was momentarily increasing. A second door, that in the center, Gatton  opened, revealing another empty room, but:    \"I have reserved this one for the last,\" he said: \"you will find that  it is unlocked.\"    He pointed to the third door, that on the right, and as he evidently  intended me to open it, I stepped forward, turned the handle and  entered a small square room, exquisitely furnished.    A heavy Persian carpet was spread upon the floor and the windows were  draped with some kind of brightly colored Madras. Tastefully-framed  water-colors hung upon the wall. There was a quaint cabinet in the  room, too; a low cushioned settee and two armchairs. In the center was  a table upon which stood a lamp with a large mosaic shade. Two  high-backed chairs were set to the table--and the table was laid for  supper! A bottle of wine stood in an ice-pail, in which the ice had  long since melted, and a tempting cold repast was spread. The table  was decorated with a bowl of perfect white roses. The silver was good;  the napery was snowy.    Like a fool I stood gaping at the spectacle, until, noting the  direction of Gatton's glance, I turned my attention to the mantelpiece  upon which a clock was ticking with a dull and solemn note.    Standing beside the clock, in a curious carved frame, was a large  photograph of Isobel!          CHAPTER VI    THE VOICE      \"This is where the mystery centers,\" said Gatton.    I made no reply, for I had not yet recovered from the shock of that  discovery in the deserted supper room. It was so wholly unexpected and  yet it so cruelly confirmed the Inspector's undisguised suspicions  that it seemed to me to have created a sort of impalpable barrier  between us. Of this Gatton was evidently conscious. He endeavored to  arouse my interest in the inquiries which he was conducting in the  garage, but for long enough I saw nothing of the place in which we  stood; I could only see that photograph smiling at me inquiringly  through a haze of doubt, and my companion's words reached me in a  muffled fashion. Finally, however, I succeeded in rousing myself from  this dazed condition, and confident as ever that Isobel was innocent  of all"]]]
