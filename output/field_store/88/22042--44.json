These were the Princes Ernest and Albert, sons  of her mother's eldest brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg. This time  the Princess was more particular in her observations. \"Ernest,\" she  remarked, \"is as tall as Ferdinand and Augustus; he has dark hair, and  fine dark eyes and eyebrows, but the nose and mouth are not good; he has  a most kind, honest, and intelligent expression in his countenance,  and has a very good figure. Albert, who is just as tall as Ernest but  stouter, is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as  mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a  very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance  is his expression, which is most delightful; c'est a la fois full of  goodness and sweetness, and very clever and intelligent.\" \"Both my  cousins,\" she added, \"are so kind and good; they are much more formes  and men of the world than Augustus; they speak English very well, and I  speak it with them. Ernest will be 18 years old on the 21st of June, and  Albert 17 on the 26th of August. Dear Uncle Ernest made me the present  of a most delightful Lory, which is so tame that it remains on your  hand and you may put your finger into its beak, or do anything with  it, without its ever attempting to bite. It is larger than Mamma's grey  parrot.\" A little later, \"I sat between my dear cousins on the sofa and  we looked at drawings. They both draw very well, particularly Albert,  and are both exceedingly fond of music; they play very nicely on the  piano. The more I see them the more I am delighted with them, and the  more I love them... It is delightful to be with them; they are so fond  of being occupied too; they are quite an example for any young person.\"  When, after a stay of three weeks, the time came for the young men  and their father to return to Germany, the moment of parting was a  melancholy one. \"It was our last HAPPY HAPPY breakfast, with this dear  Uncle and those DEAREST beloved cousins, whom I DO love so VERY VERY  dearly; MUCH MORE DEARLY than any other cousins in the WORLD. Dearly as  I love Ferdinand, and also good Augustus, I love Ernest and Albert MORE  than them, oh yes, MUCH MORE... They have both learnt a good deal, and  are very clever, naturally clever, particularly Albert, who is the most  reflecting of the two, and they like very much talking about serious  and instructive things and yet are so VERY VERY merry and gay and happy,  like young people ought to be; Albert always used to have some fun and  some clever witty answer at breakfast and everywhere; he used to play  and fondle Dash so funnily too... Dearest Albert was playing on the  piano when I came down. At 11 dear Uncle, my DEAREST BELOVED cousins,  and Charles, left us, accompanied by Count Kolowrat. I embraced both my  dearest cousins most warmly, as also my dear Uncle. I cried bitterly,  very bitterly.\" The Princes shared her ecstasies and her italics  between them; but it is clear enough where her secret preference  lay. \"Particularly Albert!\" She was just seventeen; and deep was the  impression left upon that budding organism by the young man's charm  and goodness and accomplishments, and his large blue eyes and beautiful  nose, and his sweet mouth and fine teeth.    IV    King William could not away with his sister-in-law, and the Duchess  fully returned his antipathy. Without considerable tact and considerable  forbearance their relative positions were well calculated to cause  ill-feeling; and there was very little tact in the composition of the  Duchess, and no forbearance at all in that of his Majesty. A bursting,  bubbling old gentleman, with quarterdeck gestures, round rolling eyes,  and a head like a pineapple, his sudden elevation to the throne after  fifty-six years of utter insignificance had almost sent him crazy. His  natural exuberance completely got the best of him; he rushed about doing  preposterous things in an extraordinary manner, spreading amusement  and terror in every direction, and talking all the time. His tongue  was decidedly Hanoverian, with its repetitions, its catchwords--\"That's  quite another thing! That's quite another thing!\"--its rattling  indomitability, its loud indiscreetness. His speeches, made repeatedly  at the most inopportune junctures, and filled pell-mell with all the  fancies and furies that happened at the moment to be whisking about  in his head, were the consternation of Ministers. He was one part  blackguard, people said, and three parts buffoon; but those who knew  him better could not help liking him--he meant well; and he was really  good-humoured and kind-hearted, if you took him the right way. If you  took him the wrong way, however, you must look out for squalls, as the  Duchess of Kent discovered.    She had no notion of how to deal with him--could not understand him in  the least. Occupied with her own position, her own responsibilities, her  duty, and her daughter, she had no attention to spare for the peppery  susceptibilities of a foolish, disreputable old man. She was the mother  of the heiress of England; and it was for him to recognise the fact--to  put her at once upon a proper footing--to give her the precedence of a  dowager Princess of Wales, with a large annuity from the privy purse.  It did not occur to her that such pretensions might be galling to a king  who had no legitimate child of his own, and who yet had not altogether  abandoned the hope of having one. She pressed on, with bulky vigour,  along the course she had laid out. Sir John Conroy, an Irishman with  no judgment and a great deal of self-importance, was her intimate  counsellor, and egged her on. It was advisable that Victoria should  become acquainted with the various districts of England, and through  several summers a succession of tours--in the West, in the Midlands, in  Wales--were arranged for her. The intention of the plan was excellent,  but its execution was unfortunate. The journeys, advertised in  the Press, attracting enthusiastic crowds, and involving official  receptions, took on the air of royal progresses. Addresses were  presented by loyal citizens, the delighted Duchess, swelling in sweeping  feathers and almost obliterating the diminutive Princess, read aloud,  in her German accent, gracious replies prepared beforehand by Sir  John, who, bustling and ridiculous, seemed to be mingling the roles  of major-domo and Prime Minister. Naturally the King fumed over his  newspaper at Windsor. \"That woman is a nuisance!\" he exclaimed. Poor  Queen Adelaide, amiable though disappointed, did her best to smooth  things down, changed the subject, and wrote affectionate letters to  Victoria; but it was useless. News arrived that the Duchess of Kent,  sailing in the Solent, had insisted that whenever her yacht appeared it  should be received by royal salutes from all the men-of-war and all the  forts. The King declared that these continual poppings must cease; the  Premier and the First Lord of the Admiralty were consulted; and they  wrote privately to the Duchess, begging her to waive her rights. But  she would not hear of it; Sir John Conroy was adamant. \"As her Royal  Highness's CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER,\" he said, \"I cannot recommend her  to give way on this point.\" Eventually the King, in a great state of  excitement, issued a special Order in Council, prohibiting the firing  of royal salutes to any ships except those which carried the reigning  sovereign or his consort on board.    When King William quarrelled with his Whig Ministers the situation grew  still more embittered, for now the Duchess, in addition to her other  shortcomings, was the political partisan of his enemies. In 1836 he  made an attempt to prepare the ground for a match between the Princess  Victoria and one of the sons of the Prince of Orange, and at the same  time did his best to prevent the visit of the young Coburg princes to  Kensington. He failed in both these objects; and the only result of  his efforts was to raise the anger of the King of the Belgians, who,  forgetting for a moment his royal reserve, addressed an indignant letter  on the subject to his niece. \"I am really ASTONISHED,\" he wrote, \"at  the conduct of your old Uncle the King; this invitation of the Prince  of Orange and his sons, this forcing him on others, is very  extraordinary... Not later than yesterday I got a half-official  communication from England, insinuating that it would be HIGHLY  desirable that the visit of YOUR relatives SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE  THIS YEAR--qu'en dites-vous? The relations of the Queen and the King,  therefore, to the God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals and rule  the land, when YOUR RELATIONS are to be FORBIDDEN the country, and  that when, as you know, the whole of your relations have ever been very  dutiful and kind to the King. Really and truly I never heard or saw  anything like it, and I hope it will a LITTLE ROUSE YOUR SPIRIT;  now that slavery is even abolished in the British Colonies, I do not  comprehend WHY YOUR LOT ALONE SHOULD BE TO BE KEPT A WHITE LITTLE SLAVEY  IN ENGLAND, for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought you, as I am  not aware of their ever having gone to any expense on that head, or  the King's ever having SPENT A SIXPENCE FOR YOUR EXISTENCE... Oh,  consistency and political or OTHER HONESTY, where must one look for  you!\"    Shortly afterwards King Leopold came to England himself, and his  reception was as cold at Windsor as it was warm at Kensington. \"To hear  dear Uncle speak on any subject,\" the Princess wrote in her diary,  \"is like reading a highly instructive book; his conversation is so  enlightened, so clear. He is universally admitted to be one of the first  politicians now extant.

Score the wood deeply with a carpenter's  gauge inside and out 3-1/2 in. from the top of the box. With  repeated scoring the wood will be almost cut through or in shape  to finish the cut with a knife. Now you will have the box in two  pieces. The lower part, 8-1/2 in. deep over all, we will call the  basket, and the smaller part will be known as the tray.    Remove the band from the cover and cut the boards to fit in the  tray flush with the lower edge, to make the bottom. Fasten with  3/4-in brads. The kind of wood used in making these boxes cracks  easily and leaves a rough surface which should be well  sandpapered.    The four legs are each 3/4-in. square and 30-1/2 in. long. The  tops should be beveled to keep them from splintering at the edges.  With a string or tape measure, find the circumference of the tray  or basket and divide this into four equal parts, arranging the lap  seam on both to come midway between two of the marks. When  assembling, make these seams come between the two back legs.    The tray is placed 1-1/4 in. from the top end and the basket 6-3/4  in. from the bottom end of the legs. Notch the legs at the lower  point about 1/8 in. deep and 1-1/4 in. wide to receive the band at  the lower end of the basket. Fasten with 3/4-in. screws, using  four to each leg, three of which are in the basket. Insert the  screws from the inside of the box into the legs.    Stain the wood before putting in the    [Illustration: Work Basket]    lining. If all the parts are well sandpapered, the wood will take  the stain nicely: Three yards of cretonne will make a very  attractive lining. Cut two sheets of cardboard to fit in the  bottom of the tray and basket. Cover them with the cretonne,  sewing on the back side. Cut four strips for the sides from the  width of the goods 5-1/2 in. wide and four strips 10 in. wide. Sew  them end to end and turn down one edge to a depth of 1 in. and  gather it at that point, also the lower edge when necessary. Sew  on to the covered cardboards. Fasten them to the sides of the tray  and basket with the smallest upholsterers' tacks. The product of  your labor will be a very neat and useful piece of furniture.  --Contributed by Stanley H.

The folded part in the center is pasted together. Each  aeroplane is fastened with a small thread from the point A as  shown. A figure of an airman can be pasted to each aeroplane. One  or more of the aeroplanes can be fastened in the blast of an  electric fan and kept in flight the same as a kite. The fan can be  concealed to make the display more real. When making the display,  have the background of such    [Illustration: Paper Aeroplanes in Draft]    a color as to conceal the small threads holding the aeroplanes.  --Contributed by Frederick Hennighausen, Baltimore, Md.        ** How to Make a Flint Arrowhead [23]    If you live where flints abound, possess the requisite patience  and the knack of making things, you can, with the crudest of tools  and a little practice, chip out as good arrowheads as any painted  savage that ever drew a bow.    Select a piece of straight-grained flint as near the desired shape  as possible. It may be both longer and wider than the finished  arrow but it should not be any thicker. The side, edge and end  views of a suitable fragment are shown in Fig. 1. Hold the piece  with one edge or end resting on a block of wood and strike the  upper edge lightly with a hammer, a small boulder or anything that  comes handy until the piece assumes the shape shown in Fig. 2.    [Illustration: Fig.2  Fig.3  The Stone Chipped into Shape]    The characteristic notches shown in the completed arrow, Fig. 3,  are chipped out by striking the piece lightly at the required  points with the edge of an old hatchet or a heavy flint held at  right angles to the edge of the arrow. These heads can be made so  that they cannot be distinguished from the real Indian arrowheads.  --Contributed by B. Orlando Taylor, Cross Timbers, Mo.        ** An Opening Handle for a Stamp Pad [23]    A stamp pad is a desk necessity and the cleanliness of one depends  on keeping it closed when it is not in use. The opening and  closing of a pad requires both hands and consequently the closing  of a pad is often neglected in order to avoid soiling the fingers.  This trouble can be avoided if the pad is fitted with a small  handle as shown in the sketch. Take the ordinary pad and work the  hinge until it opens freely.    [Illustration: Handle on Cover]    If necessary apply a little oil and spread the flanges of the  cover slightly.    Saw off the top of a common wood clothespin just above the slot,  saving all the solid part. Fasten this to the cover near the back  side in an upright position with a screw. A tap on the front side  of the pin will turn it over backward until the head rests on the  desk thus bringing the cover up in the upright position. When  through using the pad, a slight tap on the back side of the cover  will turn it down in place.  --Contributed by H. L. Crockett, Gloversville, N.

[Illustration: Finished Kennel]    This mission style would be in keeping with the now popular  mission and semi-mission style home, and, with slight  modifications, it could be made to conform with the ever beautiful  colonial home. It is not difficult to    [Illustration: Concrete Forms]    build and will keep in good shape for many years.

Make an oval    [Illustration: Photograph in the Shell]    opening by filing or grinding. If a file is used, it should be new  and sharp. After this is done, take a small half round file and  smooth the edges into shape and good form.    The photograph print should be quite small--less than 1/2 in.  across the face. Trim the print to a size a little larger than the  opening in the shell, and secure it in place with glue or paste.  It may be well to fill the shell with cotton. Mount the shell on a  small card with glue, or if desired, a mount of different shape  can be made of burnt woodwork.  --Contributed by C. S. Bourne, Lowell, Mass.        ** Spoon Holder on a Kettle [24]    In making marmalade and jellies the ingredients must be stirred  from time to time as the cooking proceeds. After stirring, some of  the mixture always remains on the spoon. Cooks often lay the spoon  on a plate or stand it against the cooking utensil with the handle  down. Both of these methods are wasteful. The accompanying  illustration shows a device made of sheet copper to hold the spoon  so that the drippings will return to the cooking utensil. The  copper is not hard to bend and it can be shaped so that the device  can be used on any pot or kettle.  --Contributed by Edwin Marshall, Oak Park, Ill.    [Illustration: Spoon Holder]        ** Repairing Cracked Gramophone Records [24]    Some time ago I received two gramophone records that were cracked  in shipment but the parts were held together with the paper label.  As these were single-faced disk records, I used the following  method to stick them together: I covered the back of one with  shellac and laid the two back to back centering the holes with the  crack in one running at right angles to the crack in the other.  These were placed on a flat surface and a weight set on them.  After several hours' drying, I cleaned the surplus shellac out of  the holes and played them.    As the needle passed over the cracks the noise was hardly audible.  These records have been played for a year and they sound almost as  good as new.  --Contributed by Marion P.

He fixed a funnel to the end of the intake tube of a  vacuum cleaner and hung it under a globe. The insects came to the  light, circled over the funnel and disappeared. He captured  several pounds in a few hours.  --Contributed by Geo. F. Turl, Canton, Ill.        ** Filtering with a Small Funnel [25]    In filtering a large amount of solution one usually desires some  means other than a large funnel and something to make the watching  of the process unnecessary. If a considerable quantity of a  solution be placed in a large bottle or flask, and a cork with a  small hole in it inserted in the mouth, and the apparatus  suspended in an inverted position over a small funnel so that the  opening of the cork is just below the water level in the funnel,  the filtering process goes on continuously with no overflow of the  funnel.    As soon as the solution in the funnel is below the cork, air is  let into the flask and a small quantity of new solution is let  down into the funnel. The process works well and needs no  watching, and instead of the filtrate being in a large filter  paper, it is on one small piece and can be handled with ease.  --Contributed by Loren Ward, Des Moines, Iowa.        ** A Postcard Rack [25]    The illustration shows a rack for postcards.
