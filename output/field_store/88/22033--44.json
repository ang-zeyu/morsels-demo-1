It was no great compliment that was passed on him by the  French minister, when he called the protector \"the first captain of the  age.\" His courage and conduct in the field were undoubtedly admirable:  he had a dignity of soul which the greatest dangers and difficulties  rather animated than discouraged, and his discipline and government of  the army, in all respects, was the wonder of the world. It was no  diminution of this part of his character, that he was wary in his  conduct, and that, after he was declared protector, he wore a coat of  mail concealed beneath his dress. Less caution than he made use of, in  the place he held, and surrounded as he was by secret and open enemies,  would have deserved the name of negligence. As to his political  sincerity, which many think had nothing to do with his religious  opinions, he was, to the full, as honest as the first or second Charles.  Of a truth, that same sincerity, it would appear, is no kingly virtue!  Cromwell loved justice as he loved his own life, and wherever he was  compelled to be arbitrary, it was only where his authority was  controverted, which, as things then were, it was not only right to  establish for his own sake, but for the peace and security of the  country over whose proud destinies he had been called to govern. \"The  dignity of the crown,\" to quote his own words, \"was upon the account of  the nation, of which the king was only the representative head, and  therefore, the nation being still the same, he would have the same  respect paid to his ministers as if he had been a king.\" England ought  to write the name of Cromwell in letters of gold, when she remembers  that, within a space of four or five years, he avenged all the insults  that had been lavishly flung upon her by every country in Europe  throughout a long, disastrous, and most perplexing civil war.  Gloriously did he retrieve the credit that had been mouldering and  decaying during two weak and discreditable reigns of nearly fifty years'  continuance--gloriously did he establish and extend his country's  authority and influence in remote nations--gloriously acquire the real  mastery of the British Channel--gloriously send forth fleets that went  and conquered, and never sullied the union flag by an act of dishonour  or dissimulation. Not a single Briton, during the protectorate, but  could demand and receive either reparation or revenge for injury,  whether it came from France, from Spain, from any open foe or  treacherous ally; not an oppressed foreigner claimed his protection but  it was immediately and effectually granted. Were things to be compared  to this in the reign of either Charles? England may blush at the  remembrance of the insults she sustained during the reigns of the first  most amiable, yet most weak--of the second most admired, yet most  contemptible--of these legal kings. What must she think of the treatment  of the elector palatine, though he was son-in-law to king James? And let  her ask herself how the Duke of Rohan was assisted in the Protestant war  at Rochelle, notwithstanding the solemn engagement of king Charles under  his own hand! But we are treading too fearlessly upon ground on which,  in our humble capacity, we have scarcely the right to enter. Alas! alas!  the page of history is but a sad one; and the Stuarts and the Cromwells,  the roundheads and the cavaliers, the pennons and the drums, are but  part and parcel of the same dust--the dust we, who are made of dust  animated for a time by a living spirit, now tread upon! Their words,  that wrestled with the winds and mounted on the air, have left no trace  along that air whereon they sported:--the clouds in all their beauty cap  our isle with their magnificence, as in those by-gone days; the rivers  are as blue, the seas as salt; the flowers, those sweet things! remain  fresh within our fields, as when God called them into existence in  Paradise, and are bright as ever. But the change is over us, as it has  been over them: we, too, are passing. O England! what should this teach?  Even three things--wisdom, justice, and mercy. Wisdom to watch  ourselves, and then our rulers, so that we neither do nor suffer wrong;  justice to the memory of the mighty dead, whether born to thrones or  footstools; mercy, inasmuch as we shall deeply need it from our  successors.           *       *       *       *       *      THE \"WHY AND BECAUSE\" OF CHRISTMAS.      [We can vouch for the abridgement and collation of the following facts,  connected with this joyous season of old. Probably a few of the notes  may have been discussed in the course of our twenty-volume career; but  to omit such notices on the present occasion, would be to drop a link in  the little chain:]    Why is the evening before Christmas-day celebrated?    Because Christmas-day, in the primitive Church, was always observed as  the Sabbath-day, and, like it, preceded by an eve, or vigil.--_Brand._    It was once believed, that if we were to go into a cow-house, at twelve  o'clock at night, all the cattle would be found kneeling. Many also  firmly believed that bees sung in their hives on Christmas-eve, to  welcome the approaching day.    Why is Christmas-day so called?    Because of its derivation from _Christi Missa_, the mass of Christ;  and thence the Roman Catholic Liturgy is termed their _Missal_, or  _Mass-book_. About the year 500 the observation of this day became  general in the Catholic Church.    Why was the word _Yule_ formerly used to signify Christmas?    Because of its derivation from the word _ol_, ale, which was much used  in the festivities and merry meetings of this period; and the _I_ in  _Iol, icol_. Cimb. as the _ze_ and _zi_ in _zehol, zeol, ziol_, Sax. are  premised only as intensives, to add a little to the signification, and  make it more emphatical. _Ol_, or _Ale_, did not only signify the liquor  then made use of, but gave denomination to the greatest festivals, as  that of _zehol_, or _Yule_, at Midwinter; and as is yet plainly to be  discovered in that custom of the Whitsun ale at the other great  festival.    Why are certain initials affixed to crucifixes?    Because of their signifying the titular tributes paid to the Saviour of  the world. Thus, I.N.R.I. are universally agreed to be the initials of  the Latin words _Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum_; i.e. Jesus of  Nazareth, King of the Jews, a title which Pilot wrote and affixed to the  cross.--See John, ch. xix. The initials I.H.C., appended to other  crosses, are said to imply, _Jesus Humanitatis Consolator_, Jesus  the Consoler of Mankind; and the I.H.S. imply _Jesus Hominum  Salvator_, Jesus the Saviour of Men. The first-mentioned initials  are, however, found on the most ancient crosses.    Why is a certain song called a carol?    Because of its derivation from _cantare_, to sing, and _rola_,  an interjection of joy.--_Bourne_.    Bishop Taylor observes that the \"Gloria in excelsis,\" the well-known  hymn sung by the angels to the shepherds at our Lord's nativity, was  the earliest Christmas carol. Bourne cites Durand to prove that  in the earlier ages of the churches, the bishops were accustomed, on  Christmas-day, to sing carols among their clergy. Fosbroke says--\"It was  usual, in ancient feasts, to single out a person, and place him in the  midst, to sing a song to God.\" And Mr. Davies Gilbert, late President  of the Royal Society, in a volume which he has edited on the subject,  states, that till lately, in the West of England, on Christmas-eve,  about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, festivities were commenced,  and \"the singing of carols begun, and continued late into the night.  On Christmas-day, these carols took the place of psalms in all the  churches, especially at afternoon service, the whole congregation  joining; and at the end it was usual for the parish-clerk to declare,  in a loud voice, his wishes for a merry Christmas and a happy new year  to all the parishioners.\"    Mr. Hone observes, in his work on \"Ancient Mysteries,\" that \"the custom  of singing carols at Christmas prevails in Ireland to the present time.  In Scotland, where no church fasts have been kept since the days of John  Knox, the custom is unknown. In Wales it is still preserved to a greater  extent, perhaps, than in England: at a former period, the Welsh had  carols adapted to most of the ecclesiastical festivals, and the four  seasons of the year; but at this time they are limited to that of  Christmas. After the turn of midnight, on Christmas-eve, service is  performed in the churches, followed by singing carols to the harp.  Whilst the Christmas holidays continue, they are sung in like manner in  the houses; and there are carols especially adapted to be sung at the  doors of the houses by visitors before they enter. _Lffyr Carolan_,  or the Book of Carols, contains sixty-six for Christmas, and five summer  carols. _Blodengerdd Cymrii_, or the Anthology of Wales, contains  forty-eight Christmas carols, nine summer carols, three May carols, one  winter carol, one nightingale carol, and a carol to Cupid. On the  Continent, the custom of carolling at Christmas is almost universal.  During the last days of Advent, Calabrian minstrels enter Rome, and are  to be seen in every street, saluting the shrines of the Virgin mother  with their wild music, under the traditional notion of charming her  labour pains on the approaching Christmas.\"    Why do the Christmas carols of the present day differ from the carols of  earlier times?    Because the present carols were substituted, by those enemies of  innocent mirth, the Puritans, for the original carols, which were festal  chansons for enlivening the merriment of the Christmas celebrity; and  not such religious songs as are current at this day, with the common  people, under the same title.    Dr. Johnson, in a note on _Hamlet_, tells us, that the pious  chansons, a kind of Christmas carol, containing some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#7)"],[1,"settlements of the Upit river,  and may be influenced by the beliefs held in that section. [67]    Certain individuals appear to have intimate dealings with the natural  spirits, in some instances even being joined to them in marriage. The  afterbirth child, Sayen, is believed to have lived \"not very long  ago\", yet we find his life and actions quite similar to those of  the heroes in \"the first times\", while his foster mother--the _alan_  [68]--takes the same part as did the _alan_ of old.    Relations 63 to 74 appear as pure explanatory tales, accounting  for the existence and appearance of celestial bodies and animals in  their present state; they also account for the possession of fire and  of many prized objects, such as jars and agate beads. Incidentally  many essential traits and old customs come out, such, for instance,  as those of war and mourning, which appear in connection with the  origin of the _kalau_ [69].    With few exceptions the myths of this division correspond to present  beliefs; the spirits are those known to-day; the towns mentioned are  now existing or their former locations are well known. They have thus  the appearance of being of more recent origin than those of the first  division, yet it is worthy of note that there is little in them which  seems foreign to or out of keeping with the older tales.      Fables    The last division may be said to be made up of fables, for the story  tellers without hesitation label them as fictions. The last of these  appears to be only a worked over incident of myth 56, in which the  big bird Banog carries the hero to its nest, from which he escapes  by holding to the wings of the young birds. It is possible that more  of these fables are likewise incidents in tales prevalent among the  Tinguian, but not heard by the writer. Whether or no this be true, it  is certain that most of these stories are well known to the Ilocano  of the coast and the other Christianized natives throughout the  archipelago. Comparison with the folk-lore from other regions shows  that these stories are by no means confined to the Philippines. The  chief incidents in the narrative of the turtle and the monkey have been  recorded from the Kenyah of Borneo [70] and from the northern peninsula  of Celebes [71]; the race between the shell and the carabao is told in  British North Borneo [72] in regard to the plandok and crab, while it  is known to European children as the race between the turtle and the  hare. The threat of the mosquito in 84 is almost identical with that  recorded by Evans in Borneo [73]; while many incidents in the fable  of Dogidog [74] are found in the Iban story of Simpang Impang [75].    When comparing the Tinguian versions of these fables with those of the  Ilocano, one is impressed with the fact that while the incidents upon  which they are founded are often identical, the stories themselves  have frequently been moulded and changed by the tellers, who have  introduced bits of old customs and beliefs until they reflect, in a  way, the prevalent ideas of the people. Thus in the story of the magic  _poncho_ [76], which is evidently of Spanish introduction, the owner  is identified as the _banbantay_--a well-known minor spirit. Again,  the first part of tale 85 is identical with that of the Ilocano,  but ends with the parents of the groom preparing the things used in  the _pakalon_--a very necessary part of the Tinguian marriage ceremony.    The footnotes have called attention to the many incidents which have  their parallels in other districts. Reference to these shows that  a large percentage are found in the islands toward the south. While  recognizing that similarity of incidents does not necessarily mean  identity of origin, we must still give full credit to the effects  of borrowing, even over great distances. The easy communication  along the coast during the past four hundred years and the contact  with Spanish and Christianized officials and traders will readily  explain the likeness of the tales in Division III to those held in  distant islands, or even in Europe, but, as just noted, these are  now undergoing change. Doubtless a similar inflow had been taking  place, although at a slower rate, long before the Spaniards reached  the Islands, and Tinguian mythology has grown up as the result of  blending of native tales with those of other areas, the whole being  worked over and reshaped until it fitted the social setting.    Previous writers--among them Ratzel and Graebner [77]--have sought  to account for certain resemblances in culture, between Malaysia,  Polynesia, and America, by historical connection. A part of our  material--such as that of the blood-clot child (p. 125), [78] the  rape of the maiden by the vine which carries her to the sky (p. 33),  the magic flight (p. 75), and magic growth (p. 38) [79]--may seem  to lend support to such a theory. These similarities are assuredly  suggestive and interesting, but it appears to the writer that the  material is too scanty and the folklore of intervening lands too  little known to justify us in considering them as convincing proof  of borrowing over such immense distances. [80]      General Results    Our study has brought out certain general results. We have seen  that Tinguian folklore has much in common with that of other tribes  and lands. While a part of this similarity is doubtless due to  borrowing--a process which can still be seen at work--a considerable  portion of the tales is probably of local and fairly recent origin,  while the balance appears to be very old. These older tales are so  intimately interwoven with the ceremonies, beliefs, and culture of this  people that they may safely be considered as having been developed by  them. They are doubtless much influenced by present day conditions,  for each story teller must, even unconsciously, read into them some  of his own experiences and the current beliefs of the tribe. At the  same time these traditional accounts doubtless exercise a potent  influence on the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of the people. In  Tinguian society, where custom still holds undisputed sway, these  well-known tales of past times must tend to cast into the same mould  any new facts or experiences which come to them.    We believe that we are justified when we take the viewpoint of  the Tinguian and consider \"the stories of the first times\" as  essentially very old. How old it is impossible to state definitely,  but a careful analysis of our material justifies us in believing that  they reflect a time before the people possessed terraced rice fields,  when domestic work animals were still unknown, and the horse had not  yet been introduced into their land. That these are not recent events  is attested by the great part they all now play in the ceremonial  and economic life. It is evident that outside influences of great  importance were introduced at a period later than the time when the  Chinese first began to trade along the coasts of the Philippines for  the prized jars, which play such an important role in the mythology,  are not to be identified as those of native make but are ancient  Chinese vessels dating back at least to the fourteenth and perhaps  even to the tenth century [81].    It is probable that the glass, porcelain, and agate beads, which  are second only to the jars in importance, are exceedingly old. Many  ancient specimens are still in use and are held for as fabulous prices  as are those found among the interior tribes of Borneo. Nieuwenhuis  has shown that the manufacture of beads had become a great industry  in the middle ages, and had extended even to China and Japan, whence  the products may have spread contemporaneously with the pottery [82].    We have seen that, for the most part, the life, customs, and beliefs  which appear in our reconstruction of \"the first times\" agrees  closely with present conditions; certain things which seem formerly  to have been of prime importance--such as the sending of a betel-nut  covered with gold to invite guests to a festival or ceremony--appear  to have their echo in present conditions. The betel-nut which played  such a momentous part in the old times still holds its place in the  rituals of the many ceremonies, although it is not now much used in  daily life. The magic of to-day is less powerful than formerly, but is  still a tremendous force. The communication of the ancient people with  other members of the animate world, as well as with the inanimate and  spiritual, and their metamorphosis into animals and the like, offers  nothing strange or inconsistent to the people of to-day. They even now  talk to jars, they converse with spirits who come to them through the  bodies of their mediums, and people only recently deceased are known to  have had the power of changing themselves, at will, into other forms.    In short, there is no sharp break between the mode of thought of to-day  and that exhibited in the folklore. It is true that the tales give  sanction to some things not in agreement with Tinguian usage--such,  for instance, as the marriage of relatives, or the method of disposing  of the dead--and it may be that we have here a remembrance of customs  which long ago fell into disuse.    In a previous paper [83] the writer showed that there have been many  migrations into Abra from the north, south, and west. A part of the  emigrants have become thoroughly amalgamated with the Tinguian people  and have doubtless introduced some part of their material culture  and beliefs. This helps us to understand such conflicts as we have  already noted in regard to the place held by thunder and lightning  in the spirit world, as to the future abode of the spirits of the  departed, as well as other discrepancies which the limits of this  paper have prevented us from discussing.    It is not impossible that those customs of \"the first times,\" which  are at variance with those of to-day, may"]]]
