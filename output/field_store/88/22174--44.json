About 11 o'clock twenty-five men, some armed with rifles and shotguns,    came up to the jail. They unlocked the door and held a conference among    themselves as to what they should do. Some were in favor of hanging the    five, while others insisted that only two of the brothers should be    strung up. This was finally agreed to, and the two doomed negroes were    hurried to a pasture one hundred yards distant, and there asked to take    their last chance of saving their lives by making a confession, but the    Negroes made no reply. They were then told to kneel down and pray. One    did so, the other remained standing, but both prayed fervently. The    taller Negro was then hoisted up. The shorter Negro stood gazing at the    horrible death of his brother without flinching. Five minutes later he    was also hanged. The mob decided to take the remaining brother out to    Camp Parapet and hang him there. The other two were to be taken out and    flogged, with an order to get out of the parish in less than half an    hour. The third brother, Paul, was taken out to the camp, which is about    a mile distant in the interior, and there he was hanged to a tree.    Another young man, who was in no way related to Julian, who perhaps did  not even know the man and who was entirely innocent of any offense in  connection therewith, was murdered by the same mob. The same paper says:      During the search for Julian on Saturday one branch of the posse visited    the house of a Negro family in the neighborhood of Camp Parapet, and    failing to find the object of their search, tried to induce John Willis,    a young Negro, to disclose the whereabouts of Julian. He refused to do    so, or could not do so, and was kicked to death by the gang.      AN INDIANA CASE    Almost equal to the ferocity of the mob which killed the three brothers,  Julian and the unoffending, John Willis, because of the murder of Judge  Estopinal, was the action of a mob near Vincennes, Ind. In this case a  wealthy colored man, named Allen Butler, who was well known in the  community, and enjoyed the confidence and respect of the entire country,  was made the victim of a mob and hung because his son had become unduly  intimate with a white girl who was a servant around his house. There was  no pretense that the facts were otherwise than as here stated. The woman  lived at Butler's house as a servant, and she and Butler's son fell in  love with each other, and later it was found that the girl was in a  delicate condition. It was claimed, but with how much truth no one has  ever been able to tell, that the father had procured an abortion, or  himself had operated on the girl, and that she had left the house to go  back to her home. It was never claimed that the father was in any way  responsible for the action of his son, but the authorities procured the  arrest of both father and son, and at the preliminary examination the  father gave bail to appear before the Grand Jury when it should convene.  On the same night, however, the mob took the matter in hand and with the  intention of hanging the son. It assembled near Sumner, while the boy, who  had been unable to give bail, was lodged in jail at Lawrenceville. As it  was impossible to reach Lawrenceville and hang the son, the leaders of the  mob concluded they would go to Butler's house and hang him. Butler was  found at his home, taken out by the mob and hung to a tree. This was in  the lawabiding state of Indiana, which furnished the United States its  last president and which claims all the honor, pride and glory of northern  civilization. None of the leaders of the mob were apprehended, and no  steps whatever were taken to bring the murderers to justice.      KILLED FOR HIS STEPFATHER'S CRIME    An account has been given of the cremation of Henry Smith, at Paris,  Texas, for the murder of the infant child of a man named Vance. It would  appear that human ferocity was not sated when it vented itself upon a  human being by burning his eyes out, by thrusting a red-hot iron down his  throat, and then by burning his body to ashes. Henry Smith, the victim of  these savage orgies, was beyond all the power of torture, but a few miles  outside of Paris, some members of the community concluded that it would be  proper to kill a stepson named William Butler as a partial penalty for the  original crime. This young man, against whom no word has ever been said,  and who was in fact an orderly, peaceable boy, had been watched with the  severest scrutiny by members of the mob who believed he knew something of  the whereabouts of Smith. He declared from the very first that he did not  know where his stepfather was, which statement was well proven to be a  fact after the discovery of Smith in Arkansas, whence he had fled through  swamps and woods and unfrequented places. Yet Butler was apprehended,  placed under arrest, and on the night of February 6, taken out on Hickory  Creek, five miles southeast of Paris, and hung for his stepfather's crime.  After his body was suspended in the air, the mob filled it with bullets.      LYNCHED BECAUSE THE JURY ACQUITTED HIM    The entire system of the judiciary of this country is in the hands of  white people. To this add the fact of the inherent prejudice against  colored people, and it will be clearly seen that a white jury is certain  to find a Negro prisoner guilty if there is the least evidence to warrant  such a finding.    Meredith Lewis was arrested in Roseland, La., in July of last year. A  white jury found him not guilty of the crime of murder wherewith he stood  charged. This did not suit the mob. A few nights after the verdict was  rendered, and he declared to be innocent, a mob gathered in his vicinity  and went to his house. He was called, and suspecting nothing, went  outside. He was seized and hurried off to a convenient spot and hanged by  the neck until he was dead for the murder of a woman of which the jury had  said he was innocent.      LYNCHED AS A SCAPEGOAT    Wednesday, July 5, about 10 o'clock in the morning, a terrible crime was  committed within four miles of Wickliffe, Ky. Two girls, Mary and Ruby  Ray, were found murdered a short distance from their home. The news of  this terrible cowardly murder of two helpless young girls spread like wild  fire, and searching parties scoured the territory surrounding Wickliffe  and Bardwell. Two of the searching party, the Clark brothers, saw a man  enter the Dupoyster cornfield; they got their guns and fired at the  fleeing figure, but without effect; he got away, but they said he was a  white man or nearly so. The search continued all day without effect, save  the arrest of two or three strange Negroes. A bloodhound was brought from  the penitentiary and put on the trail which he followed from the scene of  the murder to the river and into the boat of a fisherman named Gordon.  Gordon stated that he had ferried one man and only one across the river  about about half past six the evening of July 5; that his passenger sat in  front of him, and he was a white man or a very bright mulatto, who could  not be told from a white man. The bloodhound was put across the river in  the boat, and he struck a trail again at Bird's Point on the Missouri  side, ran about three hundred yards to the cottage of a white farmer named  Grant and there lay down refusing to go further.    Thursday morning a brakesman on a freight train going out of Sikeston,  Mo., discovered a Negro stealing a ride; he ordered him off and had hot  words which terminated in a fight. The brakesman had the Negro arrested.  When arrested, between 11 and 12 o'clock, he had on a dark woolen shirt,  light pants and coat, and no vest. He had twelve dollars in paper, two  silver dollars and ninety-five cents in change; he had also four rings in  his pockets, a knife and a razor which were rusted and stained. The  Sikeston authorities immediately jumped to the conclusion that this man  was the murderer for whom the Kentuckians across the river were searching.  They telegraphed to Bardwell that their prisoner had on no coat, but wore  a blue vest and pants which would perhaps correspond with the coat found  at the scene of the murder, and that the names of the murdered girls were  in the rings found in his possession.    As soon as this news was received, the sheriffs of Ballard and Carlisle  counties and a posse(?) of thirty well-armed and determined Kentuckians,  who had pledged their word the prisoner should be taken back to the scene  of the supposed crime, to be executed there if proved to be the guilty  man, chartered a train and at nine o'clock Thursday night started for  Sikeston. Arriving there two hours later, the sheriff at Sikeston, who had  no warrant for the prisoner's arrest and detention, delivered him into the  hands of the mob without authority for so doing, and accompanied them to  Bird's Point. The prisoner gave his name as Miller, his home at  Springfield, and said he had never been in Kentucky in his life, but the  sheriff turned him over to the mob to be taken to Wickliffe, that Frank  Gordon, the fisherman, who had put a man across the river might identify  him.    In other words, the protection of the law was withdrawn from C.J. Miller,  and he was given to a mob by this sheriff at Sikeston, who knew that the  prisoner's life depended on one man's word. After an altercation with the  train men, who wanted another $50 for taking the train back to Bird's  Point, the crowd arrived there at three o'clock, Friday morning. Here was  anchored _The Three States_, a ferryboat plying between Wickliffe, Ky,  Cairo, Ill., and Bird's Point, Mo. This boat left Cairo at twelve o'clock,  Thursday, with nearly three hundred of Cairo's best(?) citizens and thirty  kegs of beer on board. This was consumed while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14980"],[0,"Outwitting Our Nerves: A Primer of Psychotherapy (#7)"],[1," isolation. It is this  \"herd-instinct,\" too, which makes man so extremely sensitive to the  opinions of the society in which he lives. Because of this impulse to  go with the crowd, ideas received through education are accepted as  imperative and are backed up by all the force of the instinct of  self-regard. When the teachings of society happen to run counter to  the laws of our being, the possibilities of conflict are indeed  great.[10]    [Footnote 10: For a thorough discussion of the importance of this  instinct, see Trotter's _Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War_.]    =Acquisition.= Another fundamental disposition in both animals and  men is the instinct for possession, the instinct whose function it is  to provide for future needs. Squirrels and birds lay up nuts for the  winter; the dog hides his bone where only he can find it. Children  love to have things for their \"very own,\" and almost invariably go  through the hoarding stage in which stamps or samples or bits of  string are hoarded for the sake of possession, quite apart from their  usefulness or value. Much of the training of children consists in  learning what is \"mine\" and what is \"thine,\" and respect for the  property of others can develop only out of a sense of one's own  property rights.    =Construction.= There is an innate satisfaction in making  something,--from a doll-dress to a poem,--and this satisfaction rests  on the impulse to construct, to fashion something with our own hands  or our own brain. The emotion accompanying this instinct is too  indefinite to have a name but it is nevertheless a real one and plays  a large part in the sense of power which results from the satisfaction  of good work well done. Later it will be seen how closely related is  this impulse to the creative instinct of reproduction and how useful  it can be in drawing off the surplus energy of that much denied  instinct.    =Pugnacity and Anger.= What is it that makes us angry? A little  thought will convince us that the thing which arouses our fury is not  the sight of any special object, but the blocking of any one of the  other instincts. Watch any animal at bay when its chance for flight  has gone. The timidest one will turn and fight with every sign of  fury. Watch a mother when her young are threatened,--bear, or cat or  lion or human. Fear has no place then. It is entirely displaced by  anger over the balking of the maternal instinct of protection.  Strictly speaking, pugnacity belongs among the instincts neither of  self-preservation nor of race-preservation, but is a special device  for reinforcing both groups.    As fear supplies the energy for running, so anger fits us for  fight,--and for nothing but fight. The mechanism is almost identical  with that of fear. Brain and liver, adrenals and thyroid are the  means, but the emotion presses the button and releases the energy,  stopping all digestion and energizing all combat-muscles. The blood is  flooded with fuel and with substances which, if not used, are harmful  to the body. We were never meant to be angry without fighting. The  habit of self-control has its distinct advantages, but it is hard on  the body, which was patterned before self-control came into fashion.  The wise man, once he is aroused, lets off steam at the woodpile or on  a long, vigorous walk. He probably does not say to himself that he is  a motor animal integrated for fight and that he must get rid of  glycogen and adrenalin and thyroid secretion. He only knows that he  feels better \"on the move.\"    The wiser man does not let himself get angry in the first place unless  the situation calls for fight. However, the fight need not be a  hand-to-hand combat with one's fellow man. William James has pointed  out that there is a \"moral equivalent for war,\" and that the energy of  this instinct may be used to reinforce other impulses and help  overcome obstacles of all sorts. A good deal of the business man's  zest, the engineer's determination, and the reformer's zeal spring  from the fight-instinct used in the right way. As James, Cannon, and  others have pointed out, the way to end war may be to employ man's  instinct of pugnacity in fighting the universal enemies of the  race--fire, flood, famine, disease, and the various social  evils--rather than let it spend its force in war between nations. Even  our sports may be offshoots of the fight-instinct, for McDougall holds  that the play-tendency has its root in the instinct of rivalry, a  modified form of pugnacity. Evidently fighting-blood is a useful  inheritance, even to-day, and rightly directed is a necessary part of  a complete and forceful personality.    This, then, completes the list of self-preservative instincts, those  which are commonly called egoistic and which have been given us for  the maintenance of our own individual personal lives. But our  endowment includes another set of impulses which are no less important  and which must be reckoned with if human conduct is to be understood.          CHAPTER IV    _In which we learn more about ourselves_    THE STORY OF THE INSTINCTS (Continued)    II. THE RACE-PRESERVATIVE INSTINCTS      =Looking beyond Ourselves.= We sometimes speak of self-preservation as  though it were the only law of life, while as a matter of fact it is  but half the story. Nature has seen to it that there shall be planted  in every living creature an innate urge toward the larger life of the  race. Although the creature may never give a conscious thought to the  welfare of the race, he still bears within himself a set of instincts  which have as their end and aim, not the individual at all, but  society as a whole, and the life of generations that are to come. He  is bigger than he knows. Although he may have no notion why he feels  and acts as he does, and although he may pervert the purpose for his  own selfish end, he is continually being moved by the mighty impulse  of the race-life, an impulse which often outrivals the desire I or his  own personal existence. The craving to reproduce ourselves and the  craving to cherish and protect our young are among the most dynamic  forces in life. The two desires are so closely bound together that  they are often spoken of as one under the name of the sex-instinct, or  the family instincts. Let us look first at that part of the yearning  which urges toward perpetuating our own life in offspring.    =Watching Nature Work.= It is wonderful, indeed, to watch Nature in  the long process of Evolution, as she adapts her methods to the  growing complexity of the organism. With a variety and ingenuity of  means, but always with the same steady purpose, she works from the  lowest levels,--where there is no true reproduction, only  multiplication by division,--on through the beginning of reproduction  proper, where a single parent produces the offspring; then on to the  level where it takes two parents of different structure to produce a  new organism, and sex-life begins. At first Nature does not even  demand that father and mother shall come near each other. In the  water, the female of this type lays an egg, and the male, guided by  his instinct, swims to it and deposits his fertilizing fluid. In plant  life, bird and bee, attracted by wonderfully planned perfumes and  color and honey, are called in to carry the pollen from male to female  cell.    But it is when we come to the highest level that we find even more  subtle ways planned to accomplish the desired end. Here we enter the  realm of individual initiative, for it is not now enough to leave to  external forces the joining of the two life-elements. In order to make  a new individual, father and mother must be drawn together, and so  there enters into the situation a personal relationship with all that  that implies. Because Nature has had to provide ways of drawing  individuals to one another, she has put into the higher types of life  the power of mutual attraction,--a power which in man, the highest of  all types, is responsible for many outgrowths that seem far removed  from the original purpose.    =The Love-Motif.= On the one hand, there is the persistent desire to  be attractive, which manifests itself in the subtlest ways. How many  of the yearnings and activities of human life have their roots in this  ancient and honorable desire! The love of pretty clothes,--however it  may seem to be motivated and however it may be complicated by other  motives,-draws its energy, fundamentally, from the same need that  provides the gay plumage and limpid song of the bird or the painted  wings of the butterfly.    On the other hand, there is the capability of being attracted, with  all the personal relationships which spring from the power of admiring  and loving another person. The interest in others does not expend its  whole force on its primary objects,--mate and children. It flows out  into all human relationships, developing all the possibilities of  loving which mean so much in human life; the love of man for man and  woman for woman, as well as mutual love of man and woman. A force like  this, once planted, especially in the higher types of life, does not  spend all its energies in its main trunk. It sends out branches in  many directions, bearing by-products which are rich in value for all  of life.    Many of our richest relationships, our best impulses, and our most  firmly fixed social habits spring from the family instincts of  reproduction and parental care. The social life of our young people,  so well calculated to bring young men and women together; all the  beauty of family life and, as we shall later see, all the broader  benevolent activities for society in general, are energized by the  same love-instincts which form so large a part of human nature.      LEARNING TO LOVE    =A Four-Grade School.= It is impossible to watch the growth of the  love-life of a human being, to trace its development from babyhood up  to its culmination in mating"]]]
