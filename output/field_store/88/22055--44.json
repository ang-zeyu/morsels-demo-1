At one of  this description, belonging to Mr. Blaxland, and which is situated on the  bank of the Lower Wollombi, Mr. White and I arrived towards evening, and  passed the night.    November 28.    We left the hospitable station of Mr. Blaxland at an early hour, and  proceeded on our way to join the party. We found the country across which  we rode, very much parched from the want of rain. The grass was  everywhere yellow, or burnt up, and in many parts on fire, so that the  smoke which arose from it obscured the sun, and added sensibly to the  heat of the atmosphere.    We lost ourselves, and, consequently, a good portion of the day, from  having rode too carelessly through the forest country, while engaged in  conversation respecting the intended journey. We nevertheless reached the  place of rendezvous on Foy Brook long before night, and I encamped on a  spot where the whole party was to join me in the morning. Mr. White left  me here for the purpose of making some arrangements at home, and  respecting the supplies which I had calculated on obtaining in this part  of the country.    VALLEY OF THE HUNTER.    During the day's route, we traversed the valley of the river Hunter, an  extensive tract of country, different from that mountainous region from  which I had descended, inasmuch as it consists of low undulating land,  thinly wooded, and bearing, in most parts, a good crop of grass.    Portions of the surface near Mr. Blaxland's establishment, bore that  peculiar, undulating character which appears in the southern districts,  where it closely resembles furrows, and is termed ploughed ground. This  appearance usually indicates a good soil, which is either of a red or  very dark colour, and in which small portions of trap-rock, but more  frequently concretions of indurated marl, are found. Coal appears in the  bed and banks of the Wollombi, near Mr. Blaxland's station, and at no  great distance from his farm is a salt spring, also in the bed of this  brook. The waters in the lesser tributaries, on the north bank of the  river Hunter, become brackish when the current ceases. In that part of  the bed of this river, which is nearest to the Wollombi (or to Wambo  rather) I found an augitic rock, consisting of a mixture of felspar and  augite.    FOSSILS OF THE HUNTER.    Silicified fossil wood of a coniferous tree, is found abundantly in the  plains, and in rounded pebbles in the banks and bed of the river, also  chalcedony and compact brown haematite. A hill of some height on the  right bank, situate twenty-six miles from the seashore, is composed  chiefly of a volcanic grit of greenish grey colour, consisting  principally of felspar, and being in some parts slightly, in other parts  highly calcareous when the rock assumes a compact aspect. This deposit  contains numerous fossil shells, consisting chiefly of four distinct  species of a new genus, nearest to hippopodium; also a new species of  trochus; Atrypa glabra, and Spirifer, a shell occurring also in older  limestones of England.*    (*Footnote. These shells having been submitted to Mr. James De Carl  Sowerby, I am indebted to that gentleman for the following description:    Class Conchifera. Order, Dimyaria. Genus Megadesmus.    Valves equal, inequilateral, thick, their edges even; umbones nearly  central; hinge sunk, with an antiquated area and one ? or two ? large  teeth in each valve; ligament external, large; impressions of the  abducter muscles strong, nearly equal, united by the impression of the  mantle, at the posterior extremity of which is a small shallow sinus; no  lunette.    A genus of heavy shells in some respects resembling Astarte, in others  especially in having a striated area within the beaks, Hippopodium, from  which it is distinguished by the position of the umbones and the presence  of a thick tooth in the hinge. There appear to be four species, which may  be named Megadesmus globosus (Plate 2) M. laevis (figure 1) M. antiquatus  (figure 2) and M. cuneatus (figure 3 Plate 3) the cuneatus differs from  antiquatus, only in having the shell a little contracted towards the  anterior side.    The large shell (Plate 4 figures 1 and 2) is near to Isocardia, but Mr.  Sowerby would not venture to say it belongs to that genus.    The Trochus (Plate 4 figures 3 and 4) may be called T. oculus.)    Amongst these remains was also found embedded a very perfect specimen of  fossil wood. I may add, that in the bed of the Glindon Brook, which flows  from the left bank of the Hunter, rocks of argillaceous limestone are  found in large round boulders, some of which are more than 15 feet in  diameter.*    (*Footnote. The fossil vegetation seems to consist chiefly of the  Glossopteris brownii (of Brongniart) a fern which occurs in a stratum of  ironstone at Newcastle, and in one of the same mineral on the southern  coast, also in sandstone in the valley of the Hunter, and abundantly in  the shale near the coal wrought at Newcastle.)    November 29.    The whole equipment came up at half-past nine, whereupon I distributed  such articles as were necessary to complete the organisation of the  party, and the day was passed in making various arrangements for the  better regulation of our proceedings, both on encamping and in  travelling. I obtained from Assistant-Surveyor Dixon, then employed in  this neighbourhood, some account of Liverpool Plains--this officer having  surveyed the ranges which separate these interior regions from the  appropriated lands of the colony. The heat of this day was exceedingly  oppressive, the thermometer having been as high as 100 degrees in the  shade, but after a thundershower it fell to 88 degrees.    MEN EMPLOYED ON THE EXPEDITION.    November 30.    At length I had the satisfaction to see my party move forward in  exploring order; it consisted of the following persons, namely:    Alexander Burnett and Robert Whiting, Carpenters.  William Woods, John Palmer, Thomas Jones and William Worthington,  Sailors.  James Souter, Medical Assistant.  Robert Muirhead, Daniel Delaney and James Foreham, Bullock-Drivers.  Joseph Jones, Groom.  Stephen Bombelli, Blacksmith.  Timothy Cussack, Surveyor's Man.  Anthony Brown, Servant to me.  Henry Dawkins, Servant to Mr. White.    These were the best men I could find. All were ready to face fire or  water, in hopes of regaining by desperate exploits, a portion, at least,  of that liberty which had been forfeited to the laws of their country.  This was always a favourite service with the best disposed of the convict  prisoners, for in the event of their meriting, by their good conduct, a  favourable report on my return, the government was likely to grant them  some indulgence. I chose these men either from the characters they bore,  or according to their trade or particular qualifications: thus:    Burnett was the son of a respectable house-carpenter on the banks of the  Tweed, where he had been too fond of shooting game, his only cause of  trouble.    Whiting, a Londoner, had been a soldier in the Guards.    Woods had been found useful in the department as a surveyor's man; in  which capacity he first came under my notice, after he had been long  employed as a boatman in the survey of the coast, and having become, in  consequence, ill from scurvy, he made application to me to be employed on  shore. The justness of his request, and the services he had performed,  prepossessed me in his favour, and I never afterwards had occasion to  change my good opinion of him.    John Palmer was a sailmaker as well as a sailor, and both he and Jones  had been on board a man-of-war, and were very handy fellows.    Worthington was a strong youth, recently arrived from Nottingham. He was  nicknamed by his comrades Five-o'clock, from his having, on the outset of  the journey, disturbed them by insisting that the hour was five o'clock  soon after midnight, from his eagerness to be ready in time in the  morning.    I never saw Souter's diploma, but his experience and skill in surgery  were sufficient to satisfy us, and to acquire for him from the men the  appellation of The Doctor.    Robert Muirhead had been a soldier in India, and banished, for some  mutiny, to New South Wales; where his steady conduct had obtained for him  an excellent character.    Delaney and Foreham were experienced men in driving cattle.    Joseph Jones, originally a London groom, I had always found intelligent  and trustworthy.    Bombelli could shoe horses, and was afterwards transferred to my service  by Mr. Sempill in lieu of a very turbulent character, whom I left behind,  and who declared it to be his firm determination to be hanged.    Cussack had been a bog surveyor in Ireland; he was an honest creature,  but had got somehow implicated in a charge of administering unlawful  oaths.    Brown had been a soldier, and subsequently was assistant coachman to the  Marquis of ----.    Dawkins was an old tar, in whom Mr. White, himself formerly an officer in  the Indian navy, placed much confidence.    EQUIPMENT.    Thus it had been my study, in organising this party, to combine proved  men of both services with some neat-handed mechanics, as engineers, and  it now formed a respectable body of men, for the purpose for which it was  required.    Our materiel consisted of eight muskets, six pistols; and our small stock  of ammunition, including a box containing skyrockets, was carried on one  of the covered carts.    Of these tilted carts we had two, so constructed that they could be drawn  either by one or two horses. They were also so light, that they could be  moved across difficult passes by the men alone. Three stronger carts or  drays were loaded with our stock of provisions, consisting of flour, pork  (which had been boned in order to diminish the bulk as much as possible)  tea, tobacco, sugar and soap. We had, besides, a sufficient number of  packsaddles for the draught animals, that, in case of necessity, we might  be able to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12929"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 1 (#7)"],[1,"at the head of the Gulph; as is also that of _Maria_,  the daughter of the governor, to whom our navigator is said to have been  attached.

THREE DUTCH VESSELS. 1705.    The President De Brosses* gives, from the miscellaneous tracts of  _Nicolas Struyck_, printed at Amsterdam, 1753, the following account of  another, and last voyage of the Dutch, for the discovery of the North  Coast.    [* _Hist. des Nav. aux Terres Aust_. Tome I. page 439.]    \"March 1, 1705, three Dutch vessels were sent from _Timor_, with order to  explore the north coast of _New Holland_, better than it had before been  done. They carefully examined the coasts, sand banks, and reefs. In their  route to it, they did not meet with any land, but only some rocks above  water, in 11 deg. 52' south latitude:\" (probably the south part of the great  _Sahul Bank_; which, according to captain Peter Heywood, who saw it in  180l, lies in 11 deg. 40'.) \"They saw the west coast of New Holland 4 deg. to the  eastward of the east point of Timor. From thence they continued their  route towards the north; and passed a point, off which lies a bank of  sand above water, in length _more than five German miles_ of fifteen to a  degree. After which, they made sail to the east, along the coast of New  Holland; observing every thing with care, until they came to a gulph, the  head of which they did not quite reach. I (Struyck) have seen a chart  made of these parts.\"    What is here called the _West_, must have been the North-west Coast;  which the vessels appear to have made somewhat to the south of the  western _Cape Van Diemen_. The point which they passed, was probably this  same Cape itself; and in a chart, published by Mr. Dalrymple, Aug. 27,  1783, from a Dutch manuscript (possibly a copy of that which Struyck had  seen), a shoal, of _thirty geographic miles_ in length, is marked as  running off, from it; but incorrectly, according to Mr. Mc. Cluer. The  gulph here mentioned, was probably a deep bay in Arnhem's Land; for had  it been the Gulph of Carpentaria, some particular mention of the great  change in the direction of the coast, would, doubtless, have been made.    From this imperfect account of the voyage of these three vessels, very  little satisfactory information is obtained; and this, with some few  exceptions, is the case with all the accounts of the early Dutch  discoveries; and has usually been attributed to the monopolizing spirit  of their East-India Company, which induced it to keep secret, or to  destroy, the journals.    COOK. 1770.    The north coast of Terra Australis does not appear to have been seen by  any succeeding navigator, until the year 1770; when our celebrated  captain JAMES COOK passed through _Endeavour's Strait_, between Cape York  and the Prince of Wales' Islands; and besides clearing up the doubt  which, till then, existed, of the actual separation of Terra Australis  from New Guinea, his more accurate observations enabled geographers to  assign something like a true place to the former discoveries of the  Dutch, in these parts. Captain Cook did not land upon the main; but, at  _Possession Island_, he saw ten natives: \"Nine of them were armed with  such lances as we had been accustomed to see, and the tenth had a _bow_,  and a bundle of _arrows_, which we had never seen in the possession of  the natives of this country before.\" *    [* _Hawkesworth's Voyages_, Vol. III. page 211.]    Mc. CLUER. 1791.    At the end of the year 1791, lieutenant JOHN Mc. CLUER of the Bombay  marine, in returning from the examination of the west side of New Guinea,  made the Land of _Arnhem_, in longitude 1351/4 deg., east of Greenwich. He then  sailed westward, along the shore, to 129 deg. 55'; when the coast was found  to take a southern direction. The point of turning is placed in 11 deg. 15'  south latitude; and is, doubtless, the Cape Van Diemen of the old charts,  and the west extremity of the north coast of Terra Australis.    It does not appear that any other account has been given of this  navigation, than the chart published by Mr. Dalrymple, in 1792. According  to it, though lieutenant Mc. Cluer constantly had soundings, in from 7 to  40 fathoms; yet he was generally at such a distance from the land, that  it was not often seen; and, consequently, he was unable to identify the  particular points. No landing seems to have been effected upon the main;  but some service was rendered to navigation, by ascertaining the  positions of several small islands, shoals, and projecting parts of the  coast; and in conferring a certain degree of authenticity upon the  discoveries of the early Dutch navigators.    Lieutenant Mc. Cluer is the last person, who can strictly be said to have  added to our knowledge of the north coast of Terra Australis, previously  to the time in which the voyage of the Investigator was planned; but  several navigators had followed captain Cook through Torres' Strait, and  by considerably different routes: these it will be proper to notice; as  their discoveries are intimately connected with the present subject.    BLIGH. 1789.    After the mutineers of the _Bounty_ had forced their commander,  lieutenant (now rear-admiral) WILLIAM BLIGH, to embark in the _launch_,  near the island _Tofoa_; he steered for Coepang, a Dutch settlement, at  the south-west end of _Timor_. In the way, he made the east coast of New  South Wales, in about 121/2 deg. of South latitude; and, sailing northward,  passed round Cape York and the Prince of Wales' Islands.    It was not to be supposed, that captain Bligh, under the circumstances of  extreme distress, of fatigue, and difficulty of every kind, could do much  for navigation and geography; yet, he took views and made such  observations and notes, as enabled him to construct a chart of his track,  and of the lands and reefs seen from the launch. And as captain Bligh  passed to the _north_ of the Prince of Wales' Islands, whereas captain  Cook had passed to the south, his interesting narrative, with the  accompanying chart, made an useful addition to what little was yet known  of Torres'Strait.*    [* Bligh's \"_Voyage to the South Seas in H. M. Ship Bounty_,\" page  218-221.]    EDWARDS. 1791.    CAPTAIN (now admiral) EDWARD EDWARDS of HIS Majesty's frigate _Pandora_,  on his return from the island Taheity,* made the reefs of Torres' Strait,  on Aug. 25; in about the latitude 10 deg. south, and _two degrees_ of  longitude to the east of Cape York. Steering from thence westward, he  fell in with three islands, rather high, which he named MURRAY'S; lying  in latitude 9 deg. 57' south, and longitude 143 deg. 42' east;** and some canoes,  with two masts, were seen running within side of the reef which lay  between the islands and the ship. This reef was of considerable extent;  and, during the whole of August 26, captain Edwards ran along it to the  southward, without finding any passage through. On the 27th, the search  was continued, without success; but on the 28th, a boat was despatched to  examine an opening in the reef; and the ship stood off and on, waiting  the result. At five in the evening, the boat made a signal for a passage  being found; but fearing to venture through, so near sunset, without more  particular information, captain Edwards called the boat on board. In the  mean time, a current, or tide, set the Pandora upon the reef; and, after  beating there till ten o'clock, she went over it into deep water; and  sunk in 15 fathoms, at daylight of the 29th.    [* Commonly written _Otaheite_; but the 0 is either an article or a  preposition, and forms no part of the name: Bougainville writes it  Taiti.]    [** In Plates I. and XIII. Murray's Islands are laid down according to  their situations afterwards ascertained in the Investigator; and the  reefs, seen by the Pandora, are placed in their relative positions to  those islands.]    A dry sand bank was perceived within the opening, at the distance of four  miles; and thither the boats repaired with the remaining officers and  people; thirty-nine men having lost their lives in this melancholy  disaster. This opening was ascertained to lie in latitude 11 deg. 24' and  longitude 143 deg. 38'; and is represented as very practicable for ships.    Not being able to save any thing from the wreck, captain Edwards, almost  destitute of provisions and water, set sail on Aug. 30, with his squadron  of four boats; and steered for the north-east part of Terra Australis. No  reefs, or other dangers, appear to have been encountered in the way to  the coast; but in the course northward, along it, some islands and reefs  were seen. From one part of the coast, two canoes with three black men in  each, paddled hard after the boats; but though they waved and made many  signs, it was not thought prudent to wait for them. At one of the York  Isles, the natives, for some trifling presents, filled a keg of water for  captain Edwards; but refused to bring down any more; and, soon afterward,  they let fly a shower of arrows amongst the unfortunate sufferers.  Happily no person was wounded; and the aggressors were put to flight, by  a volley of musketry.    At the Prince of Wales' Islands, good water was found; and much  alleviated the distress of captain Edwards and his people. They heard  here the howling of wolves, (probably of wild dogs,) and \"discovered a  _morai_, or rather heap of bones. There were amongst them two human  skulls, the bones of some large animals, and some turtle bones. They were  heaped together in the form of a grave; and a long paddle, supported at  each end by a bifurcated branch of a tree, was laid horizontally along  it. Near to this, there were marks of a fire having been recently made;  and the ground about was"]]]
