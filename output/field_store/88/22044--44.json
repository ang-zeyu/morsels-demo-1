It might not have been expected, that occasions for convening the court  of civil judicature could frequently have occurred in an infant  settlement such as this; or that, when assembled, it could have had  business to occupy it above a day; yet one of these courts assembled on  the first, and continued sitting by adjournments until the fourteenth,  for the decision of many civil concerns. Among these was the recovery of  debts, several of which had been contracted very improperly, and which  were likely to involve many in ruin.    It appeared, that, to obtain spirituous liquors, these people, the  settlers, had incurred debts to so great an amount, as to preclude the  most distant hope of liquidating them, except by selling their farms.  Thus all their former industry must be sacrificed to discharge debts  which were contracted for the temporary gratification of being steeped in  beastly intoxication for a certain length of time. All the cautions which  had occasionally been inserted in the public orders against this  dangerous practice, had not proved of any advantage to those whose  benefit they were intended to promote; and it was observed with concern,  that several scenes of shameful imposition, which had been practised by  the retail dealers in this article, were brought to light by this  investigation.    Several convicts, who had served their respective terms of  transportation, having applied to be discharged from the victualling  books of the colony, and allowed to provide for themselves, it was  determined, that once during a given time certificates of their having so  served their several sentences should be granted to them, together with  the permission which they solicited. There was not any difficulty in  ascertaining the term of the convicts sent from England, as correct lists  of their several sentences from the Secretary of State's office  accompanied them: but it was not so with those who had been sent from  Ireland, and who were more likely to be dissatisfied with any  disappointment on this rather nice subject, than any other, people in  the settlement. This was an evil of some magnitude; and a representation  of it had been made to the government of that kingdom, but as yet no  answer had been received.    The season for cropping the ground being near at hand, the settlers were  informed, that such of them as had lent their men to repair the roads  would have them returned for the time that would be required to sow the  grain; after that was performed, they were expected again to come  forward, and finish what they had so well begun.    The natives excited some little degree of curiosity about this time, a  large party from Broken Bay having assembled in the lower part of the  harbour, whither those belonging to Sydney immediately repaired, for the  purpose, it was reported, of meeting them in fight; but it turned out to  be nothing more than the usual ceremony which a native of Broken Bay  underwent, of having several spears thrown at him, for having, it was  said, killed a person belonging to this part of the country. He went off  unhurt, after sustaining the appearance of much rage and violence from  the friends of the deceased.    A gang having been for some time employed in making bricks, the  foundation of a building for two assistant surgeons was marked in this  month. This was one of the necessary works already mentioned, as the  miserable quarters which those gentlemen occupied were originally  constructed only of split cabbage trees, and were at this time quite  decayed.    Some heavy rain fell during the first and latter parts of the month,  which it was hoped would extinguish the still glowing embers of the vast  fires which had surrounded the place, and which, being scattered over the  country every dry and windy day; occasioned new and dreadful  conflagrations.    There were not any arrivals during the month, except that of the Colonial  schooner from the Hawkesbury, with a cargo of Indian corn, and some wheat  that had been damaged by the weevil, an enemy which had been imported  among the rice from India.    March.] It appeared by the books in which were entered the certificates  granted to the convicts who had again become free people, that there were  at this time not less than 600 men off the store and working for  themselves in the colony; forming a vast deduction of labouring people  from the public strength, and adding a great many chances against the  safety of private and public property, as well as personal security.    An extraordinary theft was committed about the middle of the month, which  very forcibly marked the inherent depravity of some of these miscreants.  While the miller was absent for a short time, part of the sails belonging  to the mill were stolen. Now this machine was at work for the benefit of  those very incorrigible vagabonds who had thus, for a time, prevented its  being of use to any one, and who, being too lazy to grind for themselves,  had formerly been obliged to pay one third of their whole allowance of  wheat, to have the remainder ground for them by hand mills, an expense  that was saved to them by bringing their corn to the public mill.    Twice during this month it became necessary to assemble the court of  criminal judicature: at one of which, a man named Mobbs was capitally  convicted of robbing the public stores, upon the evidence of an  accomplice, who was admitted on the part of the crown. They had stolen at  different times an incredible quantity of clothing, provisions, and  various other articles, and ought to have been much sooner detected.  Mobbs suffered death, and exhibited himself at the gallows as a wicked  and hardened offender.    For offenders not deserving of capital punishment, Norfolk Island had  been for some time a place of banishment; and the convicts in general  felt this second transportation more severely than the first:  notwithstanding which, they continued to commit offences that they knew  must end in that punishment. Four prisoners, one of them a soldier, were  at this time sentenced to seven years exile to that island, for different  offences; and when viewed in this light, as a place of confinement for  some of her worst members, Norfolk Island might be considered as an  useful appendage to the principal settlement.    In pursuance of the order which was issued in January last, recommending  the settlers to appoint meetings, at which they should fix the rate of  wages that it might be proper to pay for the different kinds of labour  which their farms should require, the settlers had met, and submitted to  the governor the several resolutions that they had entered into; by which  he was enabled to fix a rate that he conceived to be fair and equitable  between the farmer and the labourer.    The following prices of labour were now established, viz                                                             L  s  d  Falling forest timber, per acre                            0  9  0  Do. in brush ground,      do                               0 10  6  Burning off open ground,  do                               1  5  0  Do. brush ground,         do                               1 10  0  Breaking up new ground,   do                               1  4  0  Chipping fresh ground,    do                               0 12  3  Chipping in wheat,        do                               0  7  0  Breaking up stubble or corn ground, 1 1/4d. per rod, or do 0 16  8  Planting Indian Corn,     do                               0  7  0  Hilling,       do         do                               0  7  0  Reaping wheat,            do                              10 10  0  Threshing do per bushel,  do                               0  0  9  Pulling and husking Indian corn, per bushel                0  0  6  Splitting paling of seven feet long, per hundred           0  3  0  Do of five feet long  do                                   0  1  6  Sawing plank,         do                                   0  7  0  Ditching per rod, three feet wide and three feet deep      0  0 10  Carriage of wheat, per bushel, per mile                    0  0  2  Do Indian corn, neat                                       0  0  3  Yearly wages for labour, with board                       10  0  0  Wages per week, with provisions, consisting of     4 lib. of salt pork or 6 lib. of fresh,     and 21 lib. of wheat, with vegetables                   0  6  0  A day's wages, with board                                  0  1  0  Do without board                                           0  2  6  A government man allowed to officers or settlers     in their own time                                       0  0 10  Price of an axe                                            0  2  0  New steeling do                                            0  0  6  A new hoe                                                  0  1  9  A sickle                                                   0  1  6  Hire of a boat to carry grain, per day                     0  5  0    The settlers were reminded, that, in order to prevent any kind of dispute  between the master and servant, when they should have occasion to hire a  man for any length of time, they would find it most convenient to engage  him for a quarter, half year, or year, and to make their agreement in  writing; on which should any dispute arise, an appeal to the magistrates  would settle it.    A person,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#7)"],[1," the river's  mouth by lines of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like  amphibious monsters reposing in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea  sparkled beneath the sun's rays. To the south a sharp point closed the  horizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that  direction, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made  this coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay  the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider  curve. There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great  banks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then  returned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the  snow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles.  From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread  vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the  presence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the  shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here  and there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little  river; they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the  mountain, among which it seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor  had left his raft of wood, it began to run between the two high granite  walls; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on  the right bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides  changed to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle  running to the extremity of the point.    \"Are we on an island?\" murmured the sailor.    \"At any rate, it seems to be big enough,\" replied the lad.    \"An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!\" said Pencroft.    But this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect  survey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island  or continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied  in its productions.    \"This is satisfactory,\" observed Pencroft; \"and in our misfortune, we  must thank Providence for it.\"    \"God be praised!\" responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of  gratitude to the Author of all things.    Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which  they had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an  inspection what the future had in store for them.    They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite  platform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most  whimsical shapes. Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the  holes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole  flock of these winged creatures.    \"Oh!\" cried he, \"those are not gulls nor sea-mews!\"    \"What are they then?\" asked Pencroft.    \"Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!\"    \"Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by  the double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their  slate-colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs  must be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in  their nests!\"    \"We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an  omelet!\" replied Pencroft merrily.    \"But what will you make your omelet in?\" asked Herbert; \"in your hat?\"    \"Well!\" replied the sailor, \"I am not quite conjuror enough for that;  we must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to  despatch the hardest!\"    Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite,  and they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being  collected, were packed in the sailor's handkerchief, and as the time  when the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began  to redescend towards the watercourse. When they arrived there, it was  an hour after midday. The tide had already turned. They must now avail  themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not  intend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither  did he mean to embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never  at a loss when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft  rapidly twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This  vegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the  sailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with  a long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded capitally. The  enormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very  equal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before  two o'clock they arrived at the river's mouth, a few paces from the  Chimneys.        Chapter 5    Pencroft's first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave  habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand,  stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the  south winds. One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to  lead out the smoke and to make the fire draw. The cave was thus divided  into three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would  scarcely have been contented deserved the name. But they were dry, and  there was space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which  occupied the center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking  all in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better.    \"Perhaps,\" said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, \"our  companions have found a superior place to ours.\"    \"Very likely,\" replied the seaman; \"but, as we don't know, we must work  all the same. Better to have two strings to one's bow than no string at  all!\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Herbert, \"how jolly it will be if they were to find  Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!\"    \"Yes, indeed!\" said Pencroft, \"that was a man of the right sort.\"    \"Was!\" exclaimed Herbert, \"do you despair of ever seeing him again?\"    \"God forbid!\" replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft  declared himself very well satisfied.    \"Now,\" said he, \"our friends can come back when they like. They will  find a good enough shelter.\"    They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper--an easy  task. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the  narrow passage which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take  the heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature  inside. Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor  laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood. The seaman was busy with  this, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.    \"Certainly,\" replied Pencroft, \"and I may say happily, for without  matches or tinder we should be in a fix.\"    \"Still we might get fire as the savages do,\" replied Herbert, \"by  rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other.\"    \"All right; try, my boy, and let's see if you can do anything besides  exercising your arms.\"    \"Well, it's a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of  the Pacific.\"    \"I don't deny it,\" replied Pencroft, \"but the savages must know how to  do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to  get fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer  matches. By the bye, where are my matches?\"    Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there,  for he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the  pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover  the box.    \"Here's a go!\" said he, looking at Herbert. \"The box must have  fallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have  something--a tinder-box--anything that can possibly make fire!\"    \"No, I haven't, Pencroft.\"    The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the  rocks, near the river's bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain.  The box was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.    \"Pencroft,\" asked Herbert, \"didn't you throw it out of the car?\"    \"I knew better than that,\" replied the sailor; \"but such a small article  could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I  would rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?\"    \"Look here, the tide is going down,\" said Herbert; \"let's run to the  place where we landed.\"    It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves  had rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well  to try. Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had  landed the day before, about two hundred feet from the cave. They hunted  there, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing.  If the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the  waves. As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with  no result. It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the  time irreparable. Pencroft could not hide his vexation; he looked very  anxious, but said not a word. Herbert tried to console him by observing,  that if they had found the matches, they would, very likely, have been  wetted by the sea and useless.    \"No, my boy,\" replied the sailor; \"they were in a copper box which shut  very tightly; and now what are we to do?\"    \"We shall certainly find some way of making a fire,\" said Herbert.  \"Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Pencroft; \"but in the meantime we are without fire, and  our companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.\"    \"But,\" said Herbert quickly, \"do you think it possible that they have no  tinder or matches?\"    \"I doubt it,\" replied the sailor, shaking his head, \"for neither Neb nor  Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep  his note-book than his match-box.\"    Herbert did not reply."]]]
