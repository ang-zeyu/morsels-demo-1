Merchants residing in these  countries are hence still considered British subjects.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Hostile character acquired by Trade.]    Again, a National Character may be acquire by Trade, or, as it is  called, by _commercial domicile_. In general, the national character  of a person, as neutral or enemy, is determined by that of his  domicile; but the property of a person may acquire a hostile character  independently of his personal national character derived from personal  domicile. A person carrying on trade habitually in the country of the  enemy, though not personally resident there, should have time given  him to withdraw from that commerce; it would press too heavily on  neutrals to say, that immediately on the first breaking out of a war,  their goods should become subject to confiscation. But if a person  enters into a house of trade in the enemy's country, in time of war,  or continued that connexion during the war, he cannot protect himself  by mere residence in a neutral country. \"It is a _doctrine_ supported  by strong principles and equity,\" says Sir William Scott, \"_that there  is a traffic which stamps a National Character_ on the individual,  independent of _that Character_ which _mere personal residence_ may  give him.\"[70] The principle does not go to the extent of saying that  a man, having a house of trade in the enemy's country, as well as in a  neutral country, should be considered in his whole concerns as an  enemy's merchant, as well in those which respected solely his neutral  house, as in those which belong to his belligerent domicile.[71]    His lawful trade is exonerated from the operation of his unlawful  trade, in all cases, and under all phases. All trade that does not  originate from the belligerent country is protected, but not so, if it  can be traced so to arise in not too remote a degree.    The same protection however is not extended to the case of a merchant  residing in the hostile country, and having a share of a house of  trade in an enemy's country. Residence in a neutral country will not  protect his share in a house established in the enemy's country,  though residence in the enemy's country will condemn his share in a  house established in a neutral country.[72]    [Sidenote: Rule of 1756.]    The next mode in which a hostile character may be given to those not  naturally bearing it, is by dealing in those branches of commerce  which are confined in the time of peace to the subjects of the enemy:  _i.e._ the ships and cargoes of a Neutral engaged in the colonial or  coasting trade of the enemy (not open to foreigners in time of peace),  are liable to the penal consequences of confiscation. This point; was  first mooted in the war of 1756, and is called the rule of 1756.[73]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: National Character of Ships.]    When there is nothing particular or special in the conduct of the  vessel itself, the national character is determined by the Residence  of the Owner; but there may be circumstances arising from that conduct  which will lead to a contrary conclusion. It is a known and  established rule with respect to a vessel, that if she is navigating  under the pass of a foreign country, she is considered as bearing the  national character of the nation under whose pass she sails; she makes  a part of its navigation, and is in every respect liable to be  considered as a vessel of that country. In like manner, and on similar  principles, if a vessel, purchased in the enemy's country, is by  constant and habitual occupation continually employed in the trade of  that country, commencing with the war, continuing during the war, and  evidently on account of the war, that vessel is deemed a ship of the  country from which she is so navigating, in the same manner as if she  evidently belonged to the inhabitants of it.[74] Further, when parties  agree to take the pass and flag of another country, they are not  permitted, in case any inconvenience should afterwards arise, to aver  against the flag and pass to which they have attached themselves, and  to claim the benefit of their real character. They are likewise  subject to this further inconvenience, that their own real character  may be pleaded against them by others. Such is the state of double  disadvantage to which persons expose themselves by assuming the flag  and pass of a foreign state.[75]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidebar: Distinction as to Cargoes]    A distinction is made in England between the Ship and the Cargo. Some  countries have gone so far as to make the flag and pass conclusive on  the cargo also; but in England it is held that goods have no  dependence upon the authority of the state, and may be differently  considered. If the cargo is laden in time of peace, though documented  as foreign property, in the same manner as the ship, the sailing under  a foreign flag and pass has not been held conclusive as to the  cargo.[76]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidebar: Hostile Property cannot be Transferred _in Transitu_.]    Property which has a hostile character at the commencement of a  voyage, cannot change that character by assignment while it is _in  transitu_, so as to protect it from capture.[77]    In the ordinary course of things, in the time of peace, such a  transfer _in transitu_ can certainly be made. When war intervenes,  another rule is set up by the Courts of Admiralty, which interferes  with the ordinary practice. In a state of war, _existing_ or  _imminent_, it is held that the property shall be deemed to continue  as it was at the time of shipment, till actual delivery; this arises  out of a state of war, which gives a belligerent a right to stop the  goods of his enemy. If such a rule did not exist, all goods shipped in  an enemy's country would be protected by transfers, which it would be  impossible to detect.[78]          CHAPTER II.        SECTION I.        _Actual War_.--_Its Effects_.        [Sidenote: Objects of War.]    Vattel tells us         \"The end of a just war is to _avenge or prevent injury_;       that is to say, to obtain justice by force, when not       obtainable by any other method; to compel an unjust       adversary to repair an injury already done, or to give us       securities against any wrong with which we are threatened by       him. As soon therefore as we have declared war, we have a       right to do against the enemy whatever we find necessary for       the attainment of that end, for the purpose of bringing him       to reason, and obtaining justice and security from him.         \"The lawfulness of the end does not give us any thing       further than barely the means necessary for the attainment       of that end. Whatever we do beyond that, is reprobated by       the law of nature--is faulty and condemnable at the tribunal       of conscience. Hence it is that the right to such acts       varies according to circumstance. What is just and perfectly       innocent in one situation is not always so on other       occasions. Right goes hand in hand with necessity and the       exigency of the case, but never exceeds them.\"    Such are some of the arguments that Vattel puts forth with all the  strength of reason and eloquence, against all unnecessary cruelty, and  all mean and perfidious warfare.    There was no limit to the career of violence and destruction,  justified by some of the earlier writers; they considered a state of  war as a dissolution of all moral ties, and a licence for every  disorder and fierceness: even such authors as Bynkershoek and Wolff,  who lived in the most learned and not the least civilized nations of  Europe, and were the contemporaries of that galaxy of talent that  adorned the commencement of the eighteenth century, held that every  thing done against an enemy was lawful. He might be destroyed, though  unarmed, harmless, defenceless; fraud, even poison, might be used  against him. A foe was a criminal and an outlaw, who had forfeited his  rights, and whose life, liberty, and property, lay at the mercy of the  victor.    But such was not the public opinion or practice of enlightened Europe  at the time they wrote. Grotius had long before, even in opposition to  his own authorities, but influenced by religion and humanity,  mentioned that many things were not fit and commendable, though they  might be strictly lawful. He held that the Law of Nations prohibited  the use of poisoned arms, the employment of assassins, violence to  women or the dead, or making slaves of prisoners. Montesquieu followed  in the same humane spirit. He writes, that the civilians said,         \"That the law of nations, to prevent prisoners being put to       death, has allowed them to be made slaves.... The reasons of       the civilians are all false. It is false, that killing in       war is lawful, unless in case of absolute necessity; but       when a man has made another his slave, he cannot be said to       be under a necessity of taking away his life, since he       actually did not take it away. War gives no other right over       prisoners than to disable them from doing any further harm,       by securing their persons. All nations concur in detesting       the murdering of prisoners in cold blood.\"[79]    Thus, it is now the established Law of Nations, that necessity is the  measure of violence in war, and humanity, its tempering spirit; or, as  it has been otherwise enunciated, the rights of war are to be measured  by the objects of the war.    Although we have a right to kill our enemies in war; it is only when  we find gentler methods insufficient to conquer their resistance and  bring them to terms, that we have a right to put them to death.[80]    Under the name of enemies are comprehended not only the first author  of the war, but also those who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#7)"],[1,"s; and thereafter, from time to  time, directed glances of furtive curiosity at Draper as he stood,  pallid and haggard, confronting the court, with a burly rural constable  on either side.    The medical evidence was taken first. Dr. Burrows, having been sworn,  began, with sarcastic emphasis, to describe the condition of the lungs  and liver, until he was interrupted by the coroner.    \"Is all this necessary?\" the latter inquired. \"I mean, is it material to  the subject of the inquiry?\"    \"I should say not,\" replied Dr. Burrows. \"It appears to me to be quite  irrelevant, but Dr. Thorndyke, who is watching the case for the defence,  thought it necessary.\"    \"I think,\" said the coroner, \"you had better give us only the facts that  are material. The jury want you to tell them what you consider to have  been the cause of death. They don't want a lecture on pathology.\"    \"The cause of death,\" said Dr. Burrows, \"was a penetrating wound of the  chest, apparently inflicted with a large knife. The weapon entered  between the second and third ribs on the left side close to the sternum  or breast-bone. It wounded the left lung, and partially divided both the  pulmonary artery and the aorta--the two principal arteries of the body.\"    \"Was this injury alone sufficient to cause death?\" the coroner asked.    \"Yes,\" was the reply; \"and death from injury to these great vessels  would be practically instantaneous.\"    \"Could the injury have been self-inflicted?\"    \"So far as the position and nature of the wound are concerned,\" replied  the witness, \"self-infliction would be quite possible. But since death  would follow in a few seconds at the most, the weapon would be found  either in the wound, or grasped in the hand, or, at least, quite close  to the body. But in this case no weapon was found at all, and the wound  must therefore certainly have been homicidal.\"    \"Did you see the body before it was moved?\"    \"Yes. It was lying on its back, with the arms extended and the legs  nearly straight; and the sand in the neighbourhood of the body was  trampled as if a furious struggle had taken place.\"    \"Did you notice anything remarkable about the footprints in the sand?\"    \"I did,\" replied Dr. Burrows. \"They were the footprints of two persons  only. One of these was evidently the deceased, whose footmarks could be  easily identified by the circular rubber heels. The other footprints  were those of a person--apparently a man--who wore shoes, or boots, the  soles of which were studded with nails; and these nails were arranged in  a very peculiar and unusual manner, for those on the soles formed a  lozenge or diamond shape, and those on the heel were set out in the form  of a cross.\"    \"Have you ever seen shoes or boots with the nails arranged in this  manner?\"    \"Yes. I have seen a pair of shoes which I am informed belong to the  accused; the nails in them are arranged as I have described.\"    \"Would you say that the footprints of which you have spoken were made  by those shoes?\"    \"No; I could not say that. I can only say that, to the best of my  belief, the pattern on the shoes is similar to that in the footprints.\"    This was the sum of Dr. Burrows' evidence, and to all of it Thorndyke  listened with an immovable countenance, though with the closest  attention. Equally attentive was the accused man, though not equally  impassive; indeed, so great was his agitation that presently one of the  constables asked permission to get him a chair.    The next witness was Arthur Jezzard. He testified that he had viewed the  body, and identified it as that of Charles Hearn; that he had been  acquainted with deceased for some years, but knew practically nothing of  his affairs. At the time of his death deceased was lodging in the  village.    \"Why did he leave the yacht?\" the coroner inquired. \"Was there any kind  of disagreement!\"    \"Not in the least,\" replied Jezzard. \"He grew tired of the confinement  of the yacht, and came to live ashore for a change. But we were the best  of friends, and he intended to come with us when we sailed.\"    \"When did you see him last?\"    \"On the night before the body was found--that is, last Monday. He had  been dining on the yacht, and we put him ashore about midnight. He said  as we were rowing him ashore that he intended to walk home along the  sands ss the tide was out. He went up the stone steps by the  watch-house, and turned at the top to wish us good-night. That was the  last time I saw him alive.\"    \"Do you know anything of the relations between the accused and the  deceased?\" the coroner asked.    \"Very little,\" replied Jezzard. \"Mr. Draper was introduced to us by the  deceased about a month ago. I believe they had been acquainted some  years, and they appeared to be on excellent terms. There was no  indication of any quarrel or disagreement between them.\"    \"What time did the accused leave the yacht on the night of the murder?\"    \"About ten o'clock. He said that he wanted to get home early, as his  housekeeper was away and he did not like the house to be left with no  one in it.\"    This was the whole of Jezzard's evidence, and was confirmed by that of  Leach and Pitford. Then, when the fisherman had deposed to the discovery  of the body, the sergeant was called, and stepped forward, grasping a  carpet-bag, and looking as uncomfortable as if he had been the accused  instead of a witness. He described the circumstances under which he saw  the body, giving the exact time and place with official precision.    \"You have heard Dr. Burrows' description of the footprints?\" the coroner  inquired.    \"Yes. There were two sets. One set were evidently made by deceased. They  showed that he entered St. Bridget's Bay from the direction of Port  Marston. He had been walking along the shore just about high-water mark,  sometimes above and sometimes below. Where he had walked below  high-water mark the footprints had of course been washed away by the  sea.\"    \"How far back did you trace the footprints of deceased?\"    \"About two-thirds of the way to Sundersley Gap. Then they disappeared  below high-water mark. Later in the evening I walked from the Gap into  Port Marston, but could not find any further traces of deceased. He  must have walked between the tide-marks all the way from Port Marston to  beyond Sundersley. When these footprints entered St. Bridget's Bay they  became mixed up with the footprints of another man, and the shore was  trampled for a space of a dozen yards as if a furious struggle had taken  place. The strange man's tracks came down from the Shepherd's Path, and  went up it again; but, owing to the hardness of the ground from the dry  weather, the tracks disappeared a short distance up the path, and I  could not find them again.\"    \"What were these strange footprints like?\" inquired the coroner.    \"They were very peculiar,\" replied the sergeant. \"They were made by  shoes armed with smallish hob-nails, which were arranged in a  diamond-shaped pattern on the holes and in a cross on the heels. I  measured the footprints carefully, and made a drawing of each foot at  the time.\" Here the sergeant produced a long notebook of funereal  aspect, and, having opened it at a marked place, handed it to the  coroner, who examined it attentively, and then passed it on to the jury.  From the jury it was presently transferred to Thorndyke, and, looking  over his shoulder, I saw a very workmanlike sketch of a pair of  footprints with the principal dimensions inserted.    Thorndyke surveyed the drawing critically, jotted down a few brief  notes, and returned the sergeant's notebook to the coroner, who, as he  took it, turned once more to the officer.    \"Have you any clue, sergeant, to the person who made these footprints?\"  he asked.    By way of reply the sergeant opened his carpet-bag, and, extracting  therefrom a pair of smart but stoutly made shoes, laid them on the  table.    \"Those shoes,\" he said, \"are the property of the accused; he was wearing  them when I arrested him. They appear to correspond exactly to the  footprints of the murderer. The measurements are the same, and the nails  with which they are studded are arranged in a similar pattern.\"    [Illustration: The Sergeant's Sketch    Extreme length, 113/4 inches.  Width at A, 41/2 inches.  Length of heel, 31/4 inches  Width of heel at cross, 3 inches.]    \"Would you swear that the footprints were made with these shoes?\" asked  the coroner.    \"No, sir, I would not,\" was the decided answer. \"I would only swear to  the similarity of size and pattern.\"    \"Had you ever seen these shoes before you made the drawing?\"    \"No, sir,\" replied the sergeant; and he then related the incident of the  footprints in the soft earth by the pond which led him to make the  arrest.    The coroner gazed reflectively at the shoes which he held in his hand,  and from them to the drawing; then, passing them to the foreman of the  jury, he remarked:    \"Well, gentlemen, it is not for me to tell you whether these shoes  answer to the description given by Dr. Burrows and the sergeant, or  whether they resemble the drawing which, as you have heard, was made by  the officer on the spot and before he had seen the shoes; that is a  matter for you to decide. Meanwhile, there is another question that we  must consider.\" He turned to the sergeant and asked: \"Have you made any  inquiries as to the movements of the accused on the night of the  murder?\"    \"I have,\" replied the sergeant, \"and I find that, on that night, the  accused was alone in the house, his housekeeper having gone over to  Eastwich. Two men saw him in the town about ten o'clock, apparently  walking in the direction of Sundersley.\"    This concluded the sergeant's evidence, and when one or two more  witnesses had been examined without eliciting any fresh facts, the  coroner briefly recapitulated the evidence, and requested the jury to  consider their verdict. Thereupon a solemn hush fell upon "]]]
