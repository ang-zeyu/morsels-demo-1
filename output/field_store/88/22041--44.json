Now it just happened that Old Mr. Toad started up the Crooked Little Path,  and it just happened that Mr. Blacksnake was coming down the Crooked Little  Path. Now when people are very much afraid, they almost always seem to  think that danger is behind instead of in front of them. It was so with Old  Mr. Toad. Instead of watching out in front as he hopped along, he kept  watching over his shoulder, and that was his second mistake. He was so sure  that Mr. Blacksnake was somewhere behind him that he didn't look to see  where he was going, and you know that people who don't look to see where  they are going are almost sure to go headfirst right into trouble.    Old Mr. Toad went hopping up the Crooked Little Path as fast as he could,  which wasn't very fast, because he never can hop very fast. And all the  time he kept looking behind for Mr. Blacksnake. Presently he came to a turn  in the Crooked Little Path, and as he hurried around it, he almost ran into  Mr. Blacksnake himself. It was a question which was more surprised. For  just a wee second they stared at each other. Then Mr. Blacksnake's eyes  began to sparkle.    \"Good morning, Mr. Toad. Isn't this a beautiful morning? I was just  thinking about you,\" said he.    But poor Old Mr. Toad didn't say good morning. He didn't say anything. He  couldn't, because he was too scared. He just gave a frightened little  squeal, turned around, and started down the Crooked Little Path twice as  fast as he had come up. Mr. Blacksnake grinned and started after him, not  very fast because he knew that he wouldn't have to run very fast to catch  Old Mr. Toad, and he thought the exercise would do him good.    And this is how it happened that summer morning that jolly, bright Mr. Sun,  looking down from the blue, blue sky and smiling to see how happy everybody  seemed, suddenly discovered that there was one of the little meadow people  who wasn't happy, but instead was terribly, terribly unhappy. It was Old  Mr. Toad hopping down the Crooked Little Path for his life, while after  him, and getting nearer and nearer, glided Mr. Blacksnake.          XVIII      JIMMY SKUNK IS JUST IN TIME    Jimmy Skunk ambled slowly along, chuckling as he thought of what a hurry  Mr. Toad had been in, when he had heard that Mr. Blacksnake had asked after  him. It had been funny, very funny indeed, to see Mr. Toad try to hurry.    Suddenly Jimmy stopped chuckling. Then he stopped ambling along the Crooked  Little Path. He turned around and looked back, and as he did so he  scratched his head thoughtfully. He had just happened to think that Old Mr.  Toad had gone up the Crooked Little Path, and it was _up_ the Crooked  Little Path that Mr. Blacksnake had shown himself that morning.    \"If he's still up there,\" thought Jimmy, \"Old Mr. Toad is hopping right  straight into the very worst kind of trouble. How stupid of him not to have  asked me where Mr. Blacksnake was! Well, it's none of my business. I guess  I'll go on.\"    But he had gone on down the Crooked Little Path only a few steps when he  stopped again. You see, Jimmy is really a very kind-hearted little fellow,  and somehow he didn't like to think of what might happen to Old Mr. Toad.    \"I hate to go way back there,\" he grumbled, for you know he is naturally  rather lazy. \"Still, the Green Meadows wouldn't be quite the same without  Old Mr. Toad. I should miss him if anything happened to him. I suppose it  would be partly my fault, too, for if I hadn't pulled over that piece of  bark, he probably would have stayed there the rest of the day and been  safe.\"    \"Maybe he won't meet Mr. Blacksnake,\" said a little voice inside of Jimmy.    \"And maybe he will,\" said Jimmy right out loud. And with that, he started  back up the Crooked Little Path, and strange to say Jimmy hurried.    He had just reached a turn in the Crooked Little Path when who should run  right plump into him but poor Old Mr. Toad. He gave a frightened squeal and  fell right over on his back, and kicked foolishly as he tried to get on his  feet again. But he was all out of breath, and so frightened and tired that  all he could do was to kick and kick. He hadn't seen Jimmy at all, for he  had been looking behind him, and he didn't even know who it was he had run  into.    Right behind him came Mr. Blacksnake. Of course he saw Jimmy, and he  stopped short and hissed angrily.    \"What were you going to do to Mr. Toad?\" demanded Jimmy.    \"None of your business!\" hissed Mr. Blacksnake. \"Get out of my way, or  you'll be sorry.\"    Jimmy Skunk just laughed and stepped in front of poor Old Mr. Toad. Mr.  Blacksnake coiled himself up in the path and darted his tongue out at Jimmy  in the most impudent way. Then he tried to make himself look very fierce.  Then he jumped straight at Jimmy Skunk with his mouth wide open, but he  took great care not to jump quite far enough to reach Jimmy. You see, he  was just trying to scare Jimmy. But Jimmy didn't scare. He knows all  about Mr. Blacksnake and that really he is a coward. So he suddenly gritted  his teeth in a way not at all pleasant to hear and started for Mr.  Blacksnake. Mr. Blacksnake didn't wait. No, Sir, he didn't wait. He  suddenly turned and glided back up the Crooked Little Path, hissing  angrily. Jimmy followed him a little way, and then he went back to Old Mr.  Toad.    \"Oh,\" panted Mr. Toad, \"you came just in time! I couldn't have hopped  another hop.\"    \"I guess I did,\" replied Jimmy. \"Now you get your breath and come along  with me.\" And Old Mr. Toad did.          XIX      OLD MR. TOAD GETS HIS STOMACH FULL      Pray do not tip your nose in scorn      At things which others eat,    For things to you not good at all      To others are most sweet.    There are ants, for instance. You wouldn't want to eat them even if you  were dreadfully hungry. But Old Mr. Toad and Buster Bear think there is  nothing much nicer. Now Buster Bear had found Old Mr. Toad catching ants,  one at a time, as he kept watch beside their home, and it had pleased  Buster to find some one else who liked ants. Right away he invited Old Mr.  Toad to dine with him. But poor Old Mr. Toad was frightened almost to death  when he heard the deep, grumbly-rumbly voice of Buster Bear, for he had  been so busy watching the ants that he hadn't seen Buster coming.    He fell right over on his back, which wasn't at all dignified, and made  Buster Bear laugh. That frightened Mr. Toad more than ever. You see he  didn't have the least doubt in the world that Buster Bear meant to eat him,  and when Buster invited him to dinner, he was sure that that was just a  joke on Buster's part.    But there was no way to escape, and after a little Old Mr. Toad thought it  best to be polite, because, you know, it always pays to be polite. So he  said in a very faint voice that he would be pleased to dine with Buster.  Then he waved his feet feebly, trying to get on his feet again. Buster  Bear laughed harder than ever. It was a low, deep, grumbly-rumbly laugh,  and sent cold shivers all over poor Old Mr. Toad. But when Buster reached  out a great paw with great cruel-looking claws Mr. Toad quite gave up. He  didn't have strength enough left to even kick. He just closed his eyes and  waited for the end.    What do you think happened? Why, he was rolled over on to his feet so  gently that he just gasped with surprise. It didn't seem possible that such  a great paw could be so gentle.    \"Now,\" said Buster Bear in a voice which he tried to make sound pleasant,  but which was grumbly-rumbly just the same, \"I know where there is a fine  dinner waiting for us just a little way from here. You follow me, and we'll  have it in no time.\"    So Buster Bear led the way, and Old Mr. Toad followed as fast as he could,  because he didn't dare not to. Presently Buster stopped beside a big  decayed old log. \"If you are ready, Mr. Toad, we will dine now,\" said he.    Old Mr. Toad didn't see anything to eat. His heart sank again, and he shook  all over. \"I--I'm not hungry,\" said he in a very faint voice.    Buster Bear didn't seem to hear. He hooked his great claws into the old log  and gave a mighty pull. Over rolled the log, and there were ants and ants  and ants, hurrying this way and scurrying that way, more ants than Mr. Toad  had seen in all his life before!    \"Help yourself,\" said Buster Bear politely.    Old Mr. Toad didn't wait to be told twice. He forgot all about his fright.  He forgot all about Buster Bear. He forgot that he wasn't hungry. He  forgot his manners. He jumped right in among those ants, and for a little  while he was the busiest Toad ever seen. Buster Bear was busy too. He swept  his long tongue this way, and he swept it that way, and each time he drew  it back into his mouth, it was covered with ants. At last Old Mr. Toad  couldn't hold another ant. Then he remembered Buster Bear and looked up a  little fearfully. Buster was smacking his lips, and there was a twinkle in  each eye.    \"Good, aren't they?\" said he.    \"The best I ever ate,\" declared Old Mr. Toad with a sigh of satisfaction.    \"Come dine with me again,\" said Buster Bear, and somehow this time Old Mr.  Toad didn't mind because his voice sounded grumbly-rumbly.    \"Thank you, I will,\" replied Old Mr. Toad.          XX      OLD MR. TOAD IS PUFFED UP    Old Mr. Toad hopped slowly down the Lone Little Path. He usually does hop  slowly, but this time he hopped slower than ever. You see, he was so puffed  up that he couldn't have hopped fast if he had wanted to, and he didn't  want to. In the first place his stomach was so full of ants that there  wasn't room for another one. No, Sir, Old Mr. Toad couldn't have swallowed  another ant if he had tried. Of course they made his stomach stick out, but  it wasn't the ants that puffed him out all over. Oh, my, no! It was pride.  That's what it was--pride. You know nothing can puff any one up quite like  foolish "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#7)"],[1,"in  the two towers of a Gothic cathedral and the intervening screen  wall of the nave. In the palaces of the Renaissance a threefold  division--vertically by means of quoins or pilasters, and horizontally  by means of cornices or string courses--was common, as was also the  division into a principal and two subordinate masses (Illustration  23).    [Illustration 22: THE LAW OF TRINITY. THE TRINITY OF HORIZONTAL VERTICAL  AND CURVED LINES.]    The architectural \"orders\" are divided threefold into pedestal or  stylobate, column and entablature; and each of these is again divided  threefold: the first into plinth, die and cornice; the second into  base, shaft and capital; the third into architrave, frieze and  cornice. In many cases these again lend themselves to a threefold  subdivision. A more detailed analysis of the capitals already shown to  be twofold reveals a third member: in the Greek Doric this consists  of the annulets immediately below the abacus; in the other orders, the  necking which divides the shaft from the cap.      CONSONANCE    \"As is the small, so is the great\" is a perpetually recurring phrase  in the literature of theosophy, and naturally so, for it is a succinct  statement of a fundamental and far-reaching truth. The scientist  recognizes it now and then and here and there, but the occultist  trusts it always and utterly. To him the microcosm and the macrocosm  are one and the same in essence, and the forth-going impulse  which calls a universe into being and the indrawing impulse which  extinguishes it again, each lasting millions of years, are echoed and  repeated in the inflow and outflow of the breath through the nostrils,  in nutrition and excretion, in daily activity and nightly rest, in  that longer day which we name a lifetime, and that longer rest in  _Devachan_--and so on until time itself is transcended.    [Illustration 23]    In the same way, in nature, a thing is echoed and repeated throughout  its parts. Each leaf on a tree is itself a tree in miniature, each  blossom a modified leaf; every vertebrate animal is a complicated  system of spines; the ripple is the wave of a larger wave, and that  larger wave is a part of the ebbing and flowing tide. In music this  law is illustrated in the return of the tonic to itself in the octave,  and its partial return in the dominant; also in a more extended sense  in the repetition of a major theme in the minor, or in the treble and  again in the bass, with modifications perhaps of time and key. In  the art of painting the law is exemplified in the repetition with  variation of certain colors and combinations of lines in different  parts of the same picture, so disposed as to lead the eye to some  focal point. Every painter knows that any important color in his  picture must be echoed, as it were, in different places, for harmony  of the whole.    [Illustration 24]    In the drama the repetition of a speech or of an entire scene, but  under circumstances which give it a different meaning, is often most  effective, as when Gratiano, in the trial scene of _The Merchant  of Venice_ taunts Shylock with his own words, \"A Daniel come to  judgment!\" or, as when in one of the later scenes of _As You Like It_  an earlier scene is repeated, but with Rosalind speaking in her proper  person and no longer as the boy Ganymede.    These recurrences, these inner consonances, these repetitions with  variations are common in architecture also. The channeled triglyphs of  a Greek Doric frieze echo the fluted columns below (Illustration 24).  The balustrade which crowns a colonnade is a repetition, in some sort,  of the colonnade itself. The modillions of a Corinthian cornice are  but elaborated and embellished dentils. Each pinnacle of a Gothic  cathedral is a little tower with its spire. As Ruskin has pointed out,  the great vault of the cathedral nave, together with the pointed roof  above it, is repeated in the entrance arch with its gable, and the  same two elements appear in every statue-enshrining niche of the  doorway. In classic architecture, as has been shown, instead of the  arch and gable, the column and entablature everywhere recur under  different forms. The minor domes which flank the great dome of the  cathedral of Florence enhance and reinforce the latter, and prepare  the eye for a climax which would otherwise be too abrupt. The central  pavilion of the Chateau Maintenon, with its two turrets, echoes the  entire facade with its two towers. Like the overture to an opera, it  introduces themes which find a more extended development elsewhere  (Illustration 26).    [Illustration 25]    [Illustration 26]    [Illustration 27]    This law of Consonance is operative in architecture more obscurely  in the form of recurring numerical ratios, identical geometrical  determining figures, parallel diagonals and the like, which will be  discussed in a subsequent essay. It has also to do with style and  scale, the adherence to substantially one method of construction and  manner of ornament, just as in music the key, or chosen series of  notes, may not be departed from except through proper modulations, or  in a specific manner.    Thus it is seen that in a work of art, as in a piece of tapestry,  the same thread runs through the web, but goes to make up different  figures. The idea is deeply theosophic: one life, many manifestations;  hence, inevitably, echoes, resemblances--_Consonance_.      DIVERSITY IN MONOTONY    Another principle of natural beauty, closely allied to the foregoing,  its complement as it were, is that of _Diversity in Monotony_--not  identity, but difference. It shows itself for the most part as a  perceptible and piquant variation between individual units belonging  to the same class, type, or species.    No two trees put forth their branches in just the same manner, and no  two leaves from the same tree exactly correspond; no two persons  look alike, though they have similiar members and features; even the  markings on the skin of the thumb are different in every human hand.  Browning says,      \"As like as a hand to another hand!    Whoever said that foolish thing,    Could not have studied to understand--\"    Now every principle of natural beauty is but the presentment of some  occult law, some theosophical truth; and this law of Diversity in  Monotony is the presentment of the truth that identity does not  exclude difference. The law is binding, yet the will is free: all men  are brothers united by the ties of brotherhood, yet each is unique, a  free agent, and never so free as when most bound by the Good Law. This  truth nature beautifully proclaims, and art also. In architecture it  is admirably exemplified in the metopes of the Parthenon frieze: seen  at a distance these must have presented a scarcely distinguishable  texture of sunlit marble and cool shadow, yet in reality each is  a separate work of art. So with the capitals of the columns of the  wonderful sea-arcade of the Venetian Ducal palace: alike in general  contour they differ widely in detail, and unfold a Bible story.  In Gothic cathedrals, in Romanesque monastery cloisters, a teeming  variety of invention is hidden beneath apparent uniformity. The  gargoyles of Notre Dame make similiar silhouettes against the sky,  but seen near at hand what a menagerie of monsters! The same spirit of  controlled individuality, of liberty subservient to the law of all, is  exemplified in the bases of the columns of the temple of Apollo near  Miletus--each one a separate masterpiece of various ornamentation  adorning an established architectural form (Illustration 28).    [Illustration 28]    [Illustration 29]    The builders of the early Italian churches, instinctively obeying this  law of Diversity in Monotony, varied the size of the arches in the  same arcade (Illustration 29), and that this was an effect of art and  not of accident or carelessness Ruskin long ago discovered, and the  Brooklyn Institute surveys have amply confirmed his view. Although  by these means the builders of that day produced effects of deceptive  perspective, of subtle concord and contrast, their sheer hatred of  monotony and meaningless repetition may have led them to diversify  their arcades in the manner described, for a rigidly equal and regular  division lacks interest and vitality.      BALANCE    If one were to establish an axial plane vertically through the center  of a tree, in most cases it would be found that the masses of foliage,  however irregularly shaped on either side of such an axis, just about  balanced each other. Similarly, in all our bodily movements, for every  change of equilibrium there occurs an opposition and adjustment of  members of such a nature that an axial plane through the center of  gravity would divide the body into two substantially equal masses,  as in the case of the tree. This physical plane law of Balance  shows itself for the most part on the human plane as the law of  Compensation, whereby, to the vision of the occultist, all accounts  are \"squared,\" so to speak. It is in effect the law of Justice, aptly  symbolized by the scales.    The law of Balance finds abundant illustration in art: in music by  the opposition, the answering, of one phrase by another of the same  elements and the same length, but involving a different sequence of  intervals; in painting by the disposition of masses in such a way that  they about equalize one another, so that there is no sense of \"strain\"  in the composition.    In architecture the common and obvious recognition of the law of  Balance is in the symmetrical disposition of the elements, whether of  plan or of elevation, on either side of axial lines. A far more subtle  and vital illustration of the law occurs when the opposed elements do  not exactly match, but differ from each other, as in the case of the  two towers of Amiens, for example. This sort of balance may be said to  be characteristic of Gothic, as"]]]
