This mysterious instrument was  called _magrepha_, and although but one Levite (the Levites were  the professional musicians among the Hebrews) was required to  play it, and although it was only about three feet in length,  its sound was so tremendous that it could be heard ten miles  away. Hieronymus speaks of having heard it on the Mount of  Olives when it was played in the Temple at Jerusalem. To add  to the mystery surrounding this instrument, it has been proved  by several learned authorities that it was merely a large drum;  and, to cap the climax, other equally respected writers have  declared that this instrument was simply a large shovel which,  after being used for the sacrificial fire in the temple, was  thrown to the ground with a great noise, to inform the people  that the sacrifice was consummated.    It is reasonably certain that the seemingly incongruous titles  to the Psalms were merely given to denote the tune to which  they were to be sung, just as in our modern hymns we use the  words _Canterbury_, _Old Hundredth_, _China_, etc.    The word _selah_ has never been satisfactorily explained, some  readings giving as its meaning \"forever,\" \"hallelujah,\" etc.,  while others say that it means repeat, an inflection of the  voice, a modulation to another key, an instrumental interlude,  a rest, and so on without end.    Of one thing we may be certain regarding the ancient Hebrews,  namely, that their religion brought something into the world  that can never again be lost. It fostered idealism, and gave  mankind something pure and noble to live for, a religion  over which Christianity shed the sunshine of divine mercy  and hope. That the change which was to be wrought in life was  sharply defined may be seen by comparing the great songs of the  different nations. For up to that time a song of praise meant  praise of a _King_. He was the sun that warmed men's hearts,  the being from whom all wisdom came, and to whom men looked  for mercy. If we compare the Egyptian hymns with those of the  Hebrews, the difference is very striking. On the walls of the  great temples of Luxor and the Ramesseum at Thebes, as well as  on the wall of the temple of Abydos and in the main hall of the  great rock-hewn temple of Abu-Simbel, in Nubia, is carved the  \"Epic of Pentaur,\" the royal Egyptian scribe of Rameses II:        My king, his arms are mighty, his heart is firm. He      bends his bow and none can resist him. Mightier      than a hundred thousand men he marches forward. His      counsel is wise and when he wears the royal crown,      Alef, and declares his will, he is the protector of      his people. His heart is like a mountain of iron. Such      is King Rameses.    If we turn to the Hebrew prophets, this is their song:        The mountains melted from before the Lord and before      Him went the pestilence; burning coals went forth at      His feet. Hell is naked before Him and destruction      hath no covering. He hangeth the earth upon nothing      and the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished      at His reproof. Though He slay me, yet will I trust      in Him. For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and at      the last day He shall stand upon the earth.    As with the Hebrews, music among the Hindus was closely  bound to religion. When, 3000 years before the Christian era,  that wonderful, tall, white Aryan race of men descended upon  India from the north, its poets already sang of the gods,  and the Aryan gods were of a different order from those known  to that part of the world; for they were beautiful in shape,  and friendly to man, in great contrast to the gods of the  Davidians, the pre-Aryan race and stock of the Deccan. These  songs formed the _Rig-Veda_, and are the nucleus from which  all Hindu religion and art emanate.    We already know that when the auxiliary speech which we call  music was first discovered, or, to use the language of all  primitive nations, when it was first bestowed on man by the  gods, it retained much of the supernatural potency that its  origin would suggest. In India, music was invested with divine  power, and certain hymns--especially the prayer or chant of  Vashishtha--were, according to the _Rig-Veda_, all powerful in  battle. Such a magic song, or chant, was called a _brahma_,  and he who sang it a _brahmin_. Thus the very foundation of  Brahminism, from which rose Buddhism in the sixth century  B.C., can be traced back to the music of the sacred songs of  the _Rig-Veda_ of India. The priestly or Brahmin caste grew  therefore from the singers of the Vedic hymns. The Brahmins  were not merely the keepers of the sacred books, or Vedas, the  philosophy, science, and laws of the ancient Hindus (for that is  how the power of the caste developed), but they were also the  creators and custodians of its secular literature and art. Two  and a half thousand years later Prince Gautama or Buddha died,  after a life of self-sacrifice and sanctity. On his death five  hundred of his disciples met in a cave near Rajagriha to gather  together his sayings, and chanted the lessons of their great  master. These songs became the bible of Buddhism, just as the  _Vedas_ are the bible of Brahminism, for the Hindu word for  a Buddhist council means literally \"a singing together.\"    Besides the sacred songs of the Brahmins and Buddhists, the  Hindus had many others, some of which partook of the occult  powers of the hymns, occult powers that were as strongly marked  as those of Hebrew music. For while the latter are revealed in  the playing of David before Saul, in the influence of music on  prophecy, the falling of the walls of Jericho at the sound of  the trumpets of Joshua, etc., in India the same supernatural  power was ascribed to certain songs. For instance, there were  songs that could be sung only by the gods, and one of them, so  the legend runs, if sung by a mortal, would envelop the singer  in flames. The last instance of the singing of this song was  during the reign of Akbar, the great Mogul emperor (about 1575  A.D.). At his command the singer sang it standing up to his  neck in the river Djaumna, which, however, did not save him,  for, according to the account, the water around him boiled,  and he was finally consumed by a flame of fire. Another of  Akbar's singers caused the palace to be wrapped in darkness  by means of one of these magic songs, and another averted a  famine by causing rain to fall when the country was threatened  by drought. Animals were also tamed by means of certain songs,  the only relic of which is found in the serpent charmers'  melodies, which, played on a kind of pipe, seem to possess the  power of controlling cobras and the other snakes exhibited by  the Indian fakirs.    Many years before Gautama's time, the brahmas or singers of  sacred songs of ancient India formed themselves into a caste or  priesthood; and the word \"Brahma,\" from meaning a sacred singer,  became the name of the supreme deity; in time, as the nation  grew, other gods were taken into the religion. Thus we find in  pre-Buddha times the trinity of gods: Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva,  with their wives, Sarasvati or learning, Lakshmi or beauty,  and Paravati, who was also called Kali, Durga, and Mahadevi,  and was practically the goddess of evil. Of these gods Brahma's  consort, Sarasvati, the goddess of speech and learning, brought  to earth the art of music, and gave to mankind the _Vina_.    This instrument is still in use and may be called the national  instrument of India. It is composed of a cylindrical pipe,  often bamboo, about three and a half feet long, at each end  of which is fixed a hollow gourd to increase the tone. It is  strung lengthwise with seven metal wires held up by nineteen  wooden bridges, just as the violin strings are supported by a  bridge. The scale of the instrument proceeds in half tones from  [F: a,] to [G: b''] The tones are produced by plucking the  strings with the fingers (which are covered with a kind of  metal thimble), and the instrument is held so that one of  the gourds hangs over the left shoulder, just as one would  hold a very long-necked banjo.    It is to the Krishna incarnation of Vishnu that the Hindu scale  is ascribed. According to the legend, Krishna or Vishnu came to  earth and took the form of a shepherd, and the nymphs sang to  him in many thousand different keys, of which from twenty-four  to thirty-six are known and form the basis of Hindu music. To  be sure these keys, being formed by different successions of  quarter-tones, are practically inexhaustible, and the 16,000  keys of Krishna are quite practicable. The differences in tone,  however, were so very slight that only a few, of them have  been retained to the present time.    The Hindus get their flute from the god Indra, who, from being  originally the all-powerful deity, was relegated by Brahminism  to the chief place among the minor gods--from being the god  of light and air he came to be the god of music. His retinue  consisted of the _gandharvas_, and _apsaras_, or celestial  musicians and nymphs, who sang magic songs. After the rise and  downfall of Buddhism in India the term _raga_ degenerated to  a name for a merely improvised chant to which no occult power  was ascribed.    The principal characteristics in modern Hindu music are a  seemingly instinctive sense of harmony; and although the actual  chords are absent, the melodic formation of the songs plainly  indicates a feeling for modern harmony, and even form. The  actual scale resembles our European scale of twelve semitones  (twenty-two _s'rutis_, quarter-tones), but the modal development  of these sounds has been extraordinary. Now a \"mode\" is the  manner in which the notes of a scale are arranged. For instance,  in our major mode the scale is arranged as follows: tone,  tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone. In India there  are at present seventy-two modes in use which are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#7)"],[1,"on.

Difficulty of coming to an Understanding with Gipsies.--The  Cabman.--Rommany for French.--\"Wanderlust.\"--Gipsy Politeness.--The  Tinker and the Painting.--Secrets of Bat-catching.--The Piper of Hamelin,  and the Tinker's Opinion of the Story.--The Walloon Tinker of Spa.--Argot.    One summer day in London, in 1871, I was seated alone in an artist's  studio.  Suddenly I heard without, beneath the window, the murmur of two  voices, and the sleepy, hissing, grating sound of a scissors-grinder's  wheel.    By me lay a few tools, one of which, a chisel, was broken.  I took it,  went softly to the window, and looked down.    There was the wheel, including all the apparatus of a travelling tinker.  I looked to see if I could discover in the two men who stood by it any  trace of the Rommany.  One, a fat, short, mind-his-own-business, ragged  son of the roads, who looked, however, as if a sturdy drinker might be  hidden in his shell, was evidently not my \"affair.\"  He seemed to be the  \"Co.\" of the firm.    But by him, and officiating at the wheeling smithy, stood a taller  figure--the face to me invisible--which I scrutinised more nearly.  And  the instant I observed his _hat_ I said to myself, \"This looks like it.\"    For dilapidated, worn, wretched as that hat was, there was in it an  attempt, though indescribably humble, to be something melo-dramatic,  foreign, Bohemian, and poetic.  It was the mere blind, dull, dead germ of  an effort--not even _life_--only the ciliary movement of an antecedent  embryo--and yet it _had_ got beyond Anglo-Saxondom.  No costermonger, or  common cad, or true Englishman, ever yet had that indefinable touch of  the opera-supernumerary in the streets.  It _was_ a sombrero.    \"That's the man for me,\" I said.  So I called him, and gave him the  chisel, and after a while went down.  He was grinding away, and touched  his hat respectfully as I approached.    Now the reader is possibly aware that of all difficult tasks one of the  most difficult is to induce a disguised Gipsy, or even a professed one,  to utter a word of Rommany to a man not of the blood.  Of this all  writers on the subject have much to say.  For it is so black-swanish, I  may say so centenarian in unfrequency, for a gentleman to speak Gipsy,  that the Zingaro thus addressed is at once subjected to morbid  astonishment and nervous fears, which under his calm countenance and  infinite \"cheek\" are indeed concealed, but which speedily reduce  themselves to two categories.    1.  That Rommany is the language of men at war with the law; therefore  you are either a detective who has acquired it for no healthy purpose, or  else you yourself are a scamp so high up in the profession that it  behooves all the little fish of outlawdom to beware of you.    2.  Or else--what is quite as much to be dreaded--you are indeed a  gentleman, but one seeking to make fun of him, and possibly able to do  so.  At any rate, your knowledge of Rommany is a most alarming coin of  vantage.  Certainly, reader, you know that a regular London streeter, say  a cabman, would rather go to jail than be beaten in a chaffing match.  I  nearly drove a hansom into sheer convulsions one night, about the time  this chapter happened, by a very light puzzler indeed.  I had hesitated  between him and another.    \"You don't know _your own mind_,\" said the disappointed candidate to me.    \"_Mind your own_ business,\" I replied.  It was a poor palindrome, {38}  reader--hardly worth telling--yet it settled him.  But he swore--oh, of  course he did--he swore beautifully.    Therefore, being moved to caution, I approached calmly and gazed  earnestly on the revolving wheel.    \"Do you know,\" I said, \"I think a great deal of your business, and take a  great interest in it.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I can tell you all the names of your tools in French.  You'd like to  hear them, wouldn't you?\"    \"Wery much indeed, sir.\"    So I took up the chisel.  \"This,\" I said, \"is a _churi_, sometimes called  a _chinomescro_.\"    \"That's the French for it, is it, sir?\" replied the tinker, gravely.  Not  a muscle of his face moved.    \"The _coals_,\" I added, \"are _hangars_ or _wongurs_, sometimes called  _kaulos_.\"    \"Never heerd the words before in my life,\" quoth the sedate tinker.    \"The bellows is a _pudemengro_.  Some call it a _pishota_.\"    \"Wery fine language, sir, is French,\" rejoined the tinker.  In every  instance he repeated the words after me, and pronounced them correctly,  which I had not invariably done.  \"Wery fine language.  But it's quite  new to me.\"    \"You wouldn't think now,\" I said, affably, \"that _I_ had ever been on the  roads!\"    The tinker looked at me from my hat to my boots, and solemnly replied--    \"I should say it was wery likely.  From your language, sir, wery likely  indeed.\"    I gazed as gravely back as if I had not been at that instant the worst  sold man in London, and asked--    \"Can you _rakher Rommanis_?\" (_i.e_., speak Gipsy.)    And _he_ said he _could_.    Then we conversed.  He spoke English intermingled with Gipsy, stopping  from time to time to explain to his assistant, or to teach him a word.  This portly person appeared to be about as well up in the English Gipsy  as myself--that is, he knew it quite as imperfectly.  I learned that the  master had been in America, and made New York and Brooklyn glad by his  presence, while Philadelphia, my native city had been benefited as to its  scissors and morals by him.    \"And as I suppose you made money there, why didn't you remain?\" I  inquired.    The Gipsy--for he was really a Gipsy, and not a half-scrag--looked at me  wistfully, and apparently a little surprised that I should ask him such a  question.    \"Why, sir, _you_ know that _we_ can't keep still.  Somethin' kept telling  me to move on, and keep a movin'.  Some day I'll go back again.\"    Suddenly--I suppose because a doubt of my perfect Freemasonry had been  aroused by my absurd question--he said, holding up a kettle--    \"What do you call this here in Rommanis?\"    \"I call it a _kekavi_ or a _kavi_,\" I said.  \"But it isn't _right_  Rommany.  It's Greek, which the Rommanichals picked up on their way  here.\"    And here I would remark, by the way, that I have seldom spoken to a Gipsy  in England who did not try me on the word for kettle.    \"And what do you call a face?\" he added.    \"I call a face a _mui_,\" I said, \"and a nose a _nak_; and as for _mui_, I  call _rikker tiro mui_, 'hold your jaw.'  That is German Rommany.\"    The tinker gazed at me admiringly, and then said, \"You're 'deep' Gipsy, I  see, sir--that's what _you_ are.\"    \"_Mo rov a jaw_; _mo rakker so drovan_?\" I answered.  \"Don't talk so  loud; do you think I want all the Gorgios around here to know I talk  Gipsy?  Come in; _jal adree the ker and pi a curro levinor_.\"    The tinker entered.  As with most Gipsies there was really, despite the  want of \"education,\" a real politeness--a singular intuitive refinement  pervading all his actions, which indicated, through many centuries of  brutalisation, that fountain-source of all politeness--the Oriental.  Many  a time I have found among Gipsies whose life, and food, and dress, and  abject ignorance, and dreadful poverty were far below that of most  paupers and prisoners, a delicacy in speaking to and acting before  ladies, and a tact in little things, utterly foreign to the great  majority of poor Anglo-Saxons, and not by any means too common in even  higher classes.    For example, there was a basket of cakes on the table, which cakes were  made like soldiers in platoons.  Now Mr Katzimengro, or Scissorman, as I  call him, not being familiar with the anatomy of such delicate and  winsome maro, or bread, was startled to find, when he picked up one  biscuit de Rheims, that he had taken a row.  Instantly he darted at me an  astonished and piteous glance, which said--    \"I cannot, with my black tinker fingers, break off and put the cakes back  again; I do not want to take all--it looks greedy.\"    So I said, \"Put them in your pocket.\"  And he did so, quietly.  I have  never seen anything done with a better grace.    On the easel hung an unfinished picture, representing the Piper of  Hamelin surrounded by rats without number.  The Gipsy appeared to be much  interested in it.    \"I used to be a rat-catcher myself,\" he said.  \"I learned the business  under old Lee, who was the greatest rat-catcher in England.  I suppose  you know, of course, sir, how to _draw_ rats?\"    \"Certainly,\" I replied.  \"Oil of rhodium.  I have known a house to be  entirely cleared by it.  There were just thirty-six rats in the house,  and they had a trap which held exactly twelve.  For three nights they  caught a dozen, and that finished the congregation.\"    \"Aniseed is better,\" replied the Gipsy, solemnly.  (By the way, another  and an older Gipsy afterwards told me that he used caraway-oil and the  heads of dried herrings.)  \"And if you've got a rat, sir, anywhere in  this here house, I'll bring it to you in five minutes.\"    He did, in fact, subsequently bring the artist as models for the picture  two very pretty rats, which he had quite tamed while catching them.    \"But what does the picture mean, sir?\" he inquired, with curiosity.    \"Once upon a time,\" I replied, \"there was a city in Germany which was  overrun with rats.  They teased the dogs and worried the cats, and bit  the babies in the cradle, and licked the soup from the cook's own ladle.\"    \"There must have been an uncommon lot of them, sir,\" replied the tinker,  gravely.    \"There was.  Millions of them.  Now in those days there were no  Rommanichals, and consequently no rat-catchers.\"    \"'Taint so "]]]
