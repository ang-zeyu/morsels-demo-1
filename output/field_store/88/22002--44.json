The man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, his arms tightly  folded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of  destruction gripped in his hand. His mood was a singular mixture of fear  and exultation. Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could  accomplish his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of  the awfulness of his crime. But his exultation far exceeded his fear. No  Anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his. Ravachol,  Vaillant, all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied  dwindled into insignificance beside him. He had only to make sure of the  water supply, and break the little tube into a reservoir. How brilliantly  he had planned it, forged the letter of introduction and got into the  laboratory, and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity! The world  should hear of him at last. All those people who had sneered at him,  neglected him, preferred other people to him, found his company  undesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death, death! They had  always treated him as a man of no importance. All the world had been in a  conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it is to  isolate a man. What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew's Street,  of course! How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The  Bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind. That was bad. He would be  caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for money, and found half a  sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into  the man's face. \"More,\" he shouted, \"if only we get away.\"    The money was snatched out of his hand. \"Right you are,\" said the cabman,  and the trap slammed, and the lash lay along the glistening side of the  horse. The cab swayed, and the Anarchist, half-standing under the trap,  put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve  his balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken half of it  rang upon the floor of the cab. He fell back into the seat with a curse,  and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron.    He shuddered.    \"Well, I suppose I shall be the first. _Phew!_ Anyhow, I shall be a  Martyr. That's something. But it is a filthy death, nevertheless. I wonder  if it hurts as much as they say.\"    Presently a thought occurred to him--he groped between his feet. A little  drop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to make  sure. It was better to make sure. At any rate, he would not fail.    Then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the  Bacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got  out. He slipped on the step, and his head felt queer. It was rapid stuff,  this cholera poison. He waved his cabman out of existence, so to speak,  and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting  the arrival of the Bacteriologist. There was something tragic in his pose.  The sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He greeted his  pursuer with a defiant laugh.    \"Vive l'Anarchie! You are too late, my friend, I have drunk it. The  cholera is abroad!\"    The Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his  spectacles. \"You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now.\" He was about to  say something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the corner  of his mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at which  the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards  Waterloo Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many  people as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision  of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the  appearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and  overcoat. \"Very good of you to bring my things,\" he said, and remained  lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the Anarchist.    \"You had better get in,\" he said, still staring. Minnie felt absolutely  convinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own  responsibility. \"Put on my shoes? Certainly, dear,\" said he, as the cab  began to turn, and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the  distance, from his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him, and  he laughed. Then he remarked, \"It is really very serious, though.    \"You see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist.  No--don't faint, or I cannot possibly tell you the rest. And I wanted to  astonish him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation  of that new species of Bacterium I was telling you of that infest, and I  think cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and, like a fool, I  said it was Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the water  of London, and he certainly might have made things look blue for this  civilised city. And now he has swallowed it. Of course, I cannot say what  will happen, but you know it turned that kitten blue, and the three  puppies--in patches, and the sparrow--bright blue. But the bother is, I  shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some more.    \"Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs. Jabber.  My dear, Mrs. Jabber is not a draught. But why should I wear a coat on a  hot day because of Mrs.-----. Oh! _very_ well.\"            IV.      THE FLOWERING OF THE STRANGE ORCHID.      The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour. You  have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the rest you  must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good luck, as your  taste may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a  respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps--for the thing  has happened again and again--there slowly unfolds before the delighted  eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety, some novel  richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or some subtler colouration or  unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom together on one  delicate green spike, and, it may be, even immortality. For the new  miracle of nature may stand in need of a new specific name, and what so  convenient as that of its discoverer? \"John-smithia\"! There have been  worse names.    It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made Winter  Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales--that hope, and also,  maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest to do  in the world. He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual man, provided with  just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity, and not enough  nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments. He might have  collected stamps or coins, or translated Horace, or bound books, or  invented new species of diatoms. But, as it happened, he grew orchids, and  had one ambitious little hothouse.    \"I have a fancy,\" he said over his coffee, \"that something is going to  happen to me to-day.\" He spoke--as he moved and thought--slowly.    \"Oh, don't say _that_!\" said his housekeeper--who was also his remote  cousin. For \"something happening\" was a euphemism that meant only one  thing to her.    \"You misunderstand me. I mean nothing unpleasant...though what I do mean I  scarcely know.    \"To-day,\" he continued, after a pause, \"Peters' are going to sell a batch  of plants from the Andamans and the Indies. I shall go up and see what  they have. It may be I shall buy something good unawares. That may be it.\"    He passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee.    \"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of  the other day?\" asked his cousin, as she filled his cup.    \"Yes,\" he said, and became meditative over a piece of toast.    \"Nothing ever does happen to me,\" he remarked presently, beginning to  think aloud. \"I wonder why? Things enough happen to other people. There is  Harvey. Only the other week; on Monday he picked up sixpence, on Wednesday  his chicks all had the staggers, on Friday his cousin came home from  Australia, and on Saturday he broke his ankle. What a whirl of  excitement!--compared to me.\"    \"I think I would rather be without so much excitement,\" said his  housekeeper. \"It can't be good for you.\"    \"I suppose it's troublesome. Still ... you see, nothing ever happens to  me. When I was a little boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as  I grew up. Never married... I wonder how it feels to have something  happen to you, something really remarkable.    \"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six--twenty years younger than  myself--when he died. And he had been married twice and divorced once; he  had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke his thigh. He killed  a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart. And in the end  he was killed by jungle-leeches. It must have all been very troublesome,  but then it must have been very interesting, you know--except, perhaps,  the leeches.\"    \"I am sure it was not good for him,\" said the lady with conviction.    \"Perhaps not.\" And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. \"Twenty-three  minutes past eight. I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so that  there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket--it is  quite warm enough--and my grey felt hat and brown shoes. I suppose--\"    He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and then  nervously at his cousin's face.    \"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to London,\" she  said in a voice that admitted of no denial. \"There's all between here and  the station coming back.\"    When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement. He had made a  purchase.

That is a good  mongoose, I am sure; he'll clear out all such vermin round here,\" said  Mr. Salton.    Adam went quietly on with his breakfast.  Killing a few snakes in a  morning was no new experience to him.  He left the room the moment  breakfast was finished and went to the study that his uncle had arranged  for him.  Both Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton took it that he wanted to be  by himself, so as to avoid any questioning or talk of the visit that he  was to make that afternoon.  They saw nothing further of him till about  half-an-hour before dinner-time.  Then he came quietly into the smoking-  room, where Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel were sitting together, ready  dressed.    \"I suppose there is no use waiting.  We had better get it over at once,\"  remarked Adam.    His uncle, thinking to make things easier for him, said: \"Get what over?\"    There was a sign of shyness about him at this.  He stammered a little at  first, but his voice became more even as he went on.    \"My visit to Mercy Farm.\"    Mr. Salton waited eagerly.  The old diplomatist simply smiled.    \"I suppose you both know that I was much interested yesterday in the  Watfords?\"  There was no denial or fending off the question.  Both the  old men smiled acquiescence.  Adam went on: \"I meant you to see it--both  of you.  You, uncle, because you are my uncle and the nearest of my own  kin, and, moreover, you couldn't have been more kind to me or made me  more welcome if you had been my own father.\"  Mr. Salton said nothing.  He  simply held out his hand, and the other took it and held it for a few  seconds.  \"And you, sir, because you have shown me something of the same  affection which in my wildest dreams of home I had no right to expect.\"  He stopped for an instant, much moved.    Sir Nathaniel answered softly, laying his hand on the youth's shoulder.    \"You are right, my boy; quite right.  That is the proper way to look at  it.  And I may tell you that we old men, who have no children of our own,  feel our hearts growing warm when we hear words like those.\"    Then Adam hurried on, speaking with a rush, as if he wanted to come to  the crucial point.    \"Mr. Watford had not come in, but Lilla and Mimi were at home, and they  made me feel very welcome.  They have all a great regard for my uncle.  I  am glad of that any way, for I like them all--much.  We were having tea,  when Mr. Caswall came to the door, attended by the negro.  Lilla opened  the door herself.  The window of the living-room at the farm is a large  one, and from within you cannot help seeing anyone coming.  Mr. Caswall  said he had ventured to call, as he wished to make the acquaintance of  all his tenants, in a less formal way, and more individually, than had  been possible to him on the previous day.  The girls made him  welcome--they are very sweet girls those, sir; someone will be very happy  some day there--with either of them.\"    \"And that man may be you, Adam,\" said Mr. Salton heartily.    A sad look came over the young man's eyes, and the fire his uncle had  seen there died out.  Likewise the timbre left his voice, making it sound  lonely.    \"Such might crown my life.  But that happiness, I fear, is not for me--or  not without pain and loss and woe.\"    \"Well, it's early days yet!\" cried Sir Nathaniel heartily.    The young man turned on him his eyes, which had now grown excessively  sad.    \"Yesterday--a few hours ago--that remark would have given me new hope--new  courage; but since then I have learned too much.\"    The old man, skilled in the human heart, did not attempt to argue in such  a matter.    \"Too early to give in, my boy.\"    \"I am not of a giving-in kind,\" replied the young man earnestly.  \"But,  after all, it is wise to realise a truth.  And when a man, though he is  young, feels as I do--as I have felt ever since yesterday, when I first  saw Mimi's eyes--his heart jumps.  He does not need to learn things.  He  knows.\"    There was silence in the room, during which the twilight stole on  imperceptibly.  It was Adam who again broke the silence.    \"Do you know, uncle, if we have any second sight in our family?\"    \"No, not that I ever heard about.  Why?\"    \"Because,\" he answered slowly, \"I have a conviction which seems to answer  all the conditions of second sight.\"    \"And then?\" asked the old man, much perturbed.    \"And then the usual inevitable.  What in the Hebrides and other places,  where the Sight is a cult--a belief--is called 'the doom'--the court from  which there is no appeal.  I have often heard of second sight--we have  many western Scots in Australia; but I have realised more of its true  inwardness in an instant of this afternoon than I did in the whole of my  life previously--a granite wall stretching up to the very heavens, so  high and so dark that the eye of God Himself cannot see beyond.  Well, if  the Doom must come, it must.  That is all.\"    The voice of Sir Nathaniel broke in, smooth and sweet and grave.    \"Can there not be a fight for it?  There can for most things.\"    \"For most things, yes, but for the Doom, no.  What a man can do I shall  do.  There will be--must be--a fight.  When and where and how I know not,  but a fight there will be.  But, after all, what is a man in such a  case?\"    \"Adam, there are three of us.\"  Salton looked at his old friend as he  spoke, and that old friend's eyes blazed.    \"Ay, three of us,\" he said, and his voice rang.    There was again a pause, and Sir Nathaniel endeavoured to get back to  less emotional and more neutral ground.    \"Tell us of the rest of the meeting.  Remember we are all pledged to  this.  It is a fight _a l'outrance_, and we can afford to throw away or  forgo no chance.\"    \"We shall throw away or lose nothing that we can help.  We fight to win,  and the stake is a life--perhaps more than one--we shall see.\"  Then he  went on in a conversational tone, such as he had used when he spoke of  the coming to the farm of Edgar Caswall: \"When Mr. Caswall came in, the  negro went a short distance away and there remained.  It gave me the idea  that he expected to be called, and intended to remain in sight, or within  hail.  Then Mimi got another cup and made fresh tea, and we all went on  together.\"    \"Was there anything uncommon--were you all quite friendly?\" asked Sir  Nathaniel quietly.    \"Quite friendly.  There was nothing that I could notice out of the  common--except,\" he went on, with a slight hardening of the voice,  \"except that he kept his eyes fixed on Lilla, in a way which was quite  intolerable to any man who might hold her dear.\"    \"Now, in what way did he look?\" asked Sir Nathaniel.    \"There was nothing in itself offensive; but no one could help noticing  it.\"    \"You did.  Miss Watford herself, who was the victim, and Mr. Caswall, who  was the offender, are out of range as witnesses.  Was there anyone else  who noticed?\"    \"Mimi did.  Her face flamed with anger as she saw the look.\"    \"What kind of look was it?  Over-ardent or too admiring, or what?  Was it  the look of a lover, or one who fain would be?  You understand?\"    \"Yes, sir, I quite understand.  Anything of that sort I should of course  notice.  It would be part of my preparation for keeping my  self-control--to which I am pledged.\"    \"If it were not amatory, was it threatening?  Where was the offence?\"    Adam smiled kindly at the old man.    \"It was not amatory.  Even if it was, such was to be expected.  I should  be the last man in the world to object, since I am myself an offender in  that respect.  Moreover, not only have I been taught to fight fair, but  by nature I believe I am just.  I would be as tolerant of and as liberal  to a rival as I should expect him to be to me.  No, the look I mean was  nothing of that kind.  And so long as it did not lack proper respect, I  should not of my own part condescend to notice it.  Did you ever study  the eyes of a hound?\"    \"At rest?\"    \"No, when he is following his instincts!  Or, better still,\" Adam went  on, \"the eyes of a bird of prey when he is following his instincts.  Not  when he is swooping, but merely when he is watching his quarry?\"    \"No,\" said Sir Nathaniel, \"I don't know that I ever did.  Why, may I  ask?\"    \"That was the look.  Certainly not amatory or anything of that kind--yet  it was, it struck me, more dangerous, if not so deadly as an actual  threatening.\"    Again there was a silence, which Sir Nathaniel broke as he stood up:    \"I think it would be well if we all thought over this by ourselves.  Then  we can renew the subject.\"          CHAPTER VII--OOLANGA      Mr. Salton had an appointment for six o'clock at Liverpool.  When he had  driven off, Sir Nathaniel took Adam by the arm.    \"May I come with you for a while to your study?  I want to speak to you  privately without your uncle knowing about it, or even what the subject  is.  You don't mind, do you?  It is not idle curiosity.  No, no.  It is  on the subject to which we are all committed.\"    \"Is it necessary to keep my uncle in the dark about it?  He might be  offended.\"    \"It is not necessary; but it is advisable.  It is for his sake that I  asked.  My friend is an old man, and it might concern him unduly--even  alarm him.  I promise you there shall be nothing that could cause him  anxiety in our silence, or at which he could take umbrage.\"    \"Go on, sir!\" said Adam simply.    \"You see, your uncle is now an old man.  I know it, for we were boys  together.  He has led an uneventful and somewhat self-contained life, so  that any such condition of things as has now arisen is apt to perplex him  from its very strangeness.  In fact, any new matter is trying to old  people.  It has its own disturbances and its own anxieties, and neither  of"]]]
