By and by he used his magical power, and many betel-nuts grew in the  field, and when they bore fruit it was covered with gold,    \"This is good,\" said Dumalawi, \"for I will scatter these betel-nuts  and they shall become people, [50] who will be my neighbors.\"    So in the middle of the night he cut the gold-covered betel-nuts into  many small pieces which he scattered in all directions. And in the  early morning, when he awoke, he heard many people talking around  the house, and many roosters crowed. Then Dumalawi knew that he  had companions, and upon going out he walked about where the people  were warming themselves [51] by fires in their yards, and he visited  them all.    In one yard was a beautiful maiden, Dapilisan, and after Dumalawi  had talked with her and her parents, he went on to the other yards,  but she was ever in his thoughts. As soon as he had visited all the  people, he returned to the house of Dapilisan and asked her parents if  he might marry her. They were unwilling at first, for they feared that  the parents of Dumalawi might not like it; but after he had explained  that his father and mother did not want him, they gave their consent,  and Dapilisan became his bride.    Soon after the marriage they decided to perform a ceremony [52] for  the spirits. So Dapilisan sent for the betel-nuts which were covered  with gold, [53] and when they were brought to her, she said:    \"You betel-nuts that are covered with gold, come here and oil  yourselves and go and invite all the people in the world to come to  our ceremony.\"    So the betel-nuts oiled themselves and went to invite the people in  the different towns.    Soon after this Aponibolinayen, the mother of Dumalawi, sat alone in  her house, still mourning the loss of her son, when suddenly she was  seized with a desire to chew betel-nut.    \"What ails me?\" she said to herself; \"why do I want to chew? I had  not intended to eat anything while Dumalawi was away.\"    So saying, she took down her basket that hung on the wall, and saw in  it a betel-nut covered with gold, and when she was about to cut it,  it said:    \"Do not cut me, for I have come to invite you to the ceremony which  Dumalawi and his wife are to make.\"    Aponibolinayen was very happy, for she knew now that her son still  lived, and she told all the people to wash their hair and prepare  to go to the rite. So they washed their clothes and their hair and  started for the home of Dumalawi; and Aponitolau, the father of the  boy, followed, but he looked like a crazy man. When the people reached  the river near the town, Dumalawi sent alligators to take them across,  but when Aponitolau got on the alligator's back it dived, and he was  thrown back upon the bank of the river. All the others were carried  safely over, and Aponitolau, who was left on the bank alone, shouted  as if crazy until Dumalawi sent another alligator to carry him across.    Then Dumalawi had food brought [54] and Dapilisan passed basi in  a little jar that looked like a fist, [55] and though each guest  drank a cupful of the sweet wine the little jar was still a third  full. After they had eaten and drunk, Aponibolinayen spoke, and,  telling all the people that she was glad to have Dapilisan for a  daughter-in-law, added:    \"Now we are going to pay the marriage price [56] according to our  custom. We shall fill the spirit house [57] nine times with different  kinds of jars.\"    Then she called, \"You spirits [58] who live in different springs, get  the jars which Dumalawi must pay as a marriage price for Dapilisan,\"    The spirits did as they were commanded, and when they brought the  jars and had filled the spirit house nine times, Aponibolinayen said  to the parents of Dapilisan:    \"I think that now we have paid the price for your daughter.\"    But Dalonagan, the mother of Dapilisan, was not satisfied, and said:    \"No, there is still more to pay.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Aponibolinayen. \"Tell us what it is and we will  pay it.\"    Then Dalonagan called a pet spider and said:    \"You big spider, go all around the town, and as you go spin a thread  [59] on which Aponibolinayen must string golden beads.\" So the spider  spun the thread and Aponibolinayen again called to the spirits of  the springs, and they brought golden beads which they strung on the  thread. Then Dalonagan hung on the thread, and when it did not break  she declared that the debt was all paid.    After this the people feasted and made merry, and when at last they  departed for home Dumalawi refused to go with his parents, but remained  with his wife in the town he had created.        The Story of Kanag    _Tinguian_      When the rice [60] had grown tall and it was near the time for it to  ripen, Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen grew fearful lest the wild pigs  should break in and destroy all their crop, so they sent their son,  Kanag, to the field to guard the grain. Kanag willingly went to the  place, but when he found that the fences were all strong so that the  pigs could not get in, and he was left with nothing to do, life in the  little watch-house [61] grew lonely, and the boy became very unhappy.    Each day Aponitolau carried cooked rice and meat to his son in the  field, but Kanag could not eat and always bade his father hang it in  the watch-house until he should want it Each time Aponitolau found  the food of the day before still untouched, and he began to suspect  that the boy was unhappy at having to guard the grain. But he said  nothing of his fears to Aponibolinayen.    One day after his father had returned home, Kanag was so lonely that  he used his magical power and became a little bird and flew up into  the top of a tree. The next day when Aponitolau came to the field  he looked everywhere for his son, and when he could not find him  he called, and from the top of a bamboo tree a little bird answered  him. Realizing what had happened, the father was very sad and begged  his son to come back and be a boy again, but Kanag only answered:    \"I would rather be a bird [62] and carry the messages of the spirits  to the people.\"    At last the father went home alone, and he and the boy's mother were  filled with grief that they had lost their son.    Some time after this, Aponitolau prepared to go out to fight. He  took his spear and shield and head-ax and started early one morning,  but when he reached the gate of the town, Kanag flew over him, giving  him a bad sign, so he turned back. The next morning he started again,  and this time the little bird gave him a good sign, and knowing that  nothing would injure him, he went on.    After a long journey he reached a hostile town where the people said  they were glad to see him, and added that because he was the first  of his people who had dared to enter their town they intended to keep  him there.    \"Oh,\" said Aponitolau, \"if you say that I cannot return home, call  all your people together and we will fight.\"    \"You are very brave,\" answered his enemies, \"if you wish to fight  us all.\"    And when the people had gathered together they laughed at him and said,  \"Why, one of our fingers would fight you.\"    Nevertheless, Aponitolau prepared to fight, and when the bravest of the  enemy threw his spear and head-ax at him he jumped and escaped. They  noticed that he jumped very high, so they all ran at him, throwing  their spears and trying to kill him.    But Aponitolau caught all their weapons, and then while they were  unarmed he threw his own spear, and it flew about among them until  it had killed them all. Then he sent his head-ax, and it cut off all  the heads of the enemy; and he used magical power so that these heads  went to his home in Kadalayapan.    After that Aponitolau sat down by the gate of the town to rest,  and the little bird, flying over his head, called down:    \"The sign that I gave you was good, Father, and you have killed all  your enemies.\"    \"Yes,\" said the man, and as he started on the home-ward journey the  little bird always flew near him. When he reached home, he stuck the  heads around the town, [63] and commanded the people to go out all  over the world and invite everyone and especially the pretty girls  to come to a party in celebration of his victory.    The people came from all parts of the world, and while they played  on the gongs and danced, Aponitolau called to Kanag and said:    \"Come down, my son; do not stay always in the tops of the trees. Come  and see the pretty girls and see which one you want to marry. Get  the golden cup and give them basi to drink.\"    But Kanag answered, \"I would rather stay in the tops of the trees  and give the signs when anyone goes to fight.\"    Then the father and mother pleaded with him to become a boy once  more, begging his forgiveness and promising never again to send him  to guard the rice. But he would not listen to them, and only flew away.    Finding that they could not win him that way, Aponitolau and  Aponibolinayen called the spirit servants, and commanded them to  follow Kanag wherever he went, and to find a girl whom he would want  to marry. So the spirit servants went after him, and wherever he went  they followed.    By and by they stopped near a well, and there the spirit servants  used magic so that all the pretty girls nearby felt very hot; and  in the early morning, they came to the well to bathe. One among them  was so beautiful that she looked like a flame of fire [64] among the  betel-nut blossoms, and when the servants saw her washing her hair  they ran to Kanag and begged him to come and see her. At first he  would not listen to them, but after a while he flew into the top of  a betel-nut tree near by, and when he caught sight of her, he flew  into the tree above her head.    \"But,\" said he to the servants, \"what can I do if I become a man now,  for I have no clothes and no head-band?\"    \"Do not worry about that,\" said the spirit servants, \"for we have  everything"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12815"],[0,"American Cookery: The Art of Dressing Viands, Fish, Poultry, and Vegetables (#7)"],[1,"flour,  into which pour one pound butter, melted in one pint milk, nine eggs,  one gill emptins, (carroway seed and currants, or raisins if you  please) make into two loaves, bake one and half hour.      _Queens Cake_.
