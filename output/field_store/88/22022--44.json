Within the elastic limit the relative stretching and contraction  of the fibres is directly[9] proportional to their distances  from a plane intermediate between them--the ~neutral plane~.  (N_{1} P in Fig. 15.) Thus the fibres half-way between the  neutral plane and the outer surface experience only half as much  shortening or elongation as the outermost or extreme fibres.  Similarly for other distances. The elements along the neutral  plane experience no tension or compression in an axial  direction. The line of intersection of this plane and the plane  of section is known as the ~neutral axis~ (N A in Fig. 15) of  the section.    [Footnote 9: While in reality this relationship does not exactly  hold, the formulae for beams are based on its assumption.]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Diagram of a simple beam. N_{1} P =  neutral plane, N A = neutral axis of section R S.]    If the bar is symmetrical and homogeneous the neutral plane is  located half-way between the upper and lower surfaces, so long  as the deflection does not exceed the elastic limit of the  material. Owing to the fact that the tensile strength of wood is  from two to nearly four times the compressive strength, it  follows that at rupture the neutral plane is much nearer the  convex than the concave side of the bar or beam, since the sum  of all the compressive stresses on the concave portion must  always equal the sum of the tensile stresses on the convex  portion. The neutral plane begins to change from its central  position as soon as the elastic limit has been passed. Its  location at any time is very uncertain.    The external forces acting to bend the bar also tend to rupture  it at right angles to the neutral plane by causing one  transverse section to slip past another. This stress at any  point is equal to the resultant perpendicular to the axis of the  forces acting at this point, and is termed the ~transverse  shear~ (or in the case of beams, ~vertical shear~).    In addition to this there is a shearing stress, tending to move  the fibres past one another in an axial direction, which is  called ~longitudinal shear~ (or in the case of beams,  ~horizontal shear~). This stress must be taken into  consideration in the design of timber structures. It is maximum  at the neutral plane and decreases to zero at the outer elements  of the section. The shorter the span of a beam in proportion to  its height, the greater is the liability of failure in  horizontal shear before the ultimate strength of the beam is  reached.      _Beams_    There are three common forms of beams, as follows:    (1) ~Simple beam~--a bar resting upon two supports, one near  each end. (See Fig. 16, No. 1.)    (2) ~Cantilever beam~--a bar resting upon one support or  fulcrum, or that portion of any beam projecting out of a wall or  beyond a support. (See Fig. 16, No. 2.)    (3) ~Continuous beam~--a bar resting upon more than two  supports. (See Fig. 16, No. 3.)    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Three common forms of beams. 1. Simple.  2. Cantilever. 3. Continuous.]      _Stiffness of Beams_    The two main requirements of a beam are stiffness and strength.  The formulae for the _modulus of elasticity (E)_ or measure of  stiffness of a rectangular prismatic simple beam loaded at the  centre and resting freely on supports at either end is:[10]    [Footnote 10: Only this form of beam is considered since it is  the simplest. For cantilever and continuous beams, and beams  rigidly fixed at one or both ends, as well as for different  methods of loading, different forms of cross section, etc.,  other formulae are required. See any book on mechanics.]               P' l^{3}       E = -------------            4 D b h^{3}       b = breadth or width of beam, inches.     h = height or depth of beam, inches.     l = span (length between points of supports) of beam, inches.     D = deflection produced by load P', inches.    P' = load at or below elastic limit, pounds.    From this formulae it is evident that for rectangular beams of  the same material, mode of support, and loading, the deflection  is affected as follows:    (1) It is inversely proportional to the width for beams of the  same length and depth. If the width is tripled the deflection is  one-third as great.    (2) It is inversely proportional to the cube of the depth for  beams of the same length and breadth. If the depth is tripled  the deflection is one twenty-seventh as great.    (3) It is directly proportional to the cube of the span for  beams of the same breadth and depth. Tripling the span gives  twenty-seven times the deflection.    The number of pounds which concentrated at the centre will  deflect a rectangular prismatic simple beam one inch may be  found from the preceding formulae by substituting D = 1\" and  solving for P'. The formulae then becomes:                                  4 E b h^{3}       Necessary weight (P') = -------------                                   l^{3}    In this case the values for E are read from tables prepared from  data obtained by experimentation on the given material.      _Strength of Beams_    The measure of the breaking strength of a beam is expressed in  terms of unit stress by a _modulus of rupture_, which is a  purely hypothetical expression for points beyond the elastic  limit. The formulae used in computing this modulus is as follows:              1.5 P l       R = ---------            b h{^2}      b, h, l = breadth, height, and span, respectively, as in      preceding formulae.    R = modulus of rupture, pounds per square inch.    P = maximum load, pounds.    In calculating the fibre stress at the elastic limit the same  formulae is used except that the load at elastic limit (P_{1}) is  substituted for the maximum load (P).    From this formulae it is evident that for rectangular prismatic  beams of the same material, mode of support, and loading, the  load which a given beam can support varies as follows:    (1) It is directly proportional to the breadth for beams of the  same length and depth, as is the case with stiffness.    (2) It is directly proportional to the square of the height for  beams of the same length and breadth, instead of as the cube of  this dimension as in stiffness.    (3) It is inversely proportional to the span for beams of the  same breadth and depth and not to the cube of this dimension as  in stiffness.    The fact that the strength varies as the _square_ of the height  and the stiffness as the _cube_ explains the relationship of  bending to thickness.

CHAPTER IV.      Directions for Various Ways of Dressing Meat and Poultry.    INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.    Boiling is the most simple manner of cooking, the great art in  this process is to boil the article sufficiently, without its being  overdone, the necessity of slow boiling cannot be too strongly  impressed upon the cook, as the contrary, renders it hard and of a bad  color; the average time of boiling for fresh meat is half an hour to  every pound, salt meat requires half as long again, and smoked meat  still longer; the lid of the saucepan should only be removed for  skimming, which is an essential process.    Roasting chiefly depends on the skilful management of the fire, it is  considered that a joint of eight pounds requires two hours roasting;  when first put down it should be basted with fresh dripping, and  afterwards with its own dripping, it should be sprinkled with salt,  and repeatedly dredged with flour, which browns and makes it look rich  and frothy.    Broiling requires a steady clear fire, free from flame and smoke, the  gridiron should be quite hot before the article is placed on it, and  the bars should be rubbed with fat, or if the article is thin-skinned  and delicate, with chalk; the gridiron should be held aslant to  prevent the fat dripping into the fire; the bars of a gridiron should  be close and fine. Frying is easier than broiling, the fat, oil or  butter in which the article is fried must be boiling, but have ceased  to bubble before it is put in the pan, or it will be greasy and black:  there is now a new description of fryingpan, called a saute pan, and  which will be found extremely convenient for frying small cutlets or  collops.    Stewing is a more elaborate mode of boiling; a gentle heat with  frequent skimmings, are the points to be observed.    Glazing is done by brushing melted jelly over the article to be glazed  and letting it cool, and then adding another coat, or in some cases  two or three, this makes any cold meats or poultry have an elegant  appearance.    Blanching makes the article plump and white. It should be set on the  fire in cold water, boil up and then be immersed in cold water,  where it should remain some little time. Larding (the French term is  _Pique_, which the inexperienced Jewish cook may not be acquainted  with, we therefore use the term in common use) is a term given to  a certain mode of garnishing the surface of meat or poultry: it  is inserting small pieces of the fat of smoked meats, truffles, or  tongue, which are trimmed into slips of equal length and size, into  the flesh of the article at regular distances, and is effected by  means of larding pins.    Poelee and Blanc, are terms used in modern cookery for a very  expensive mode of stewing: it is done by stewing the article with  meat, vegetables, and fat of smoked meats, all well seasoned; instead  of placing it to stew in water it is placed on slices of meat covered  with slices of fat and the vegetables and seasoning added, then water  enough to cover the whole is added.    Blanc differs from Poelee, in having a quantity of suet added, and  being boiled down before the article is placed to stew in it.    Braising is a similar process to Poelee, but less meat and vegetable  is used.           *       *       *       *       *    TO CLARIFY SUET.    Melt down with care fine fresh suet, either beef or veal, put it into  a jar, and set it in a stew-pan of water to boil, putting in a sprig  of rosemary, or a little orange flower water while melting, this is  a very useful preparation and will be found, if adopted in English  kitchens, to answer the purpose of lard and is far more delicate and  wholesome: it should be well beaten till quite light with a wooden  fork.           *       *       *       *       *    OLIO.    Put eight pounds of beef in sufficient water to cover it, when the  water boils take out the meat, skim off the fat, and then return the  meat to the stew-pan, adding at the same time two fine white cabbages  without any of the stalk or hard parts; season with pepper, salt, and  a tea-spoonful of white sugar, let it simmer on a slow fire for  about five hours, about an hour before serving, add half a pound of  _chorisa_, which greatly improves the flavor.           *       *       *       *       *    AN EXCELLENT RECEIPT FOR STEWING A RUMP OF BEEF.    Chop fine a large onion, four bay leaves, and a little parsley, add to  these half an ounce of ground ginger, a tea-spoonful of salt, a blade  of mace, a little ground allspice, some lemon sliced, and some of the  peel grated; rub all these ingredients well into the meat, then place  it into a stew-pan with three parts of a cup of vinegar, a calf's-foot  cut in small pieces and a pint of water, stew gently till tender,  when the fat must be carefully skimmed off the gravy, which must be  strained and poured over the meat.           *       *       *       *       *    ALAMODE BEEF, OR SOUR MEAT.    Cover a piece of the ribs of beef boned and filletted, or a piece of  the round with vinegar diluted with water, season with onions, pepper,  salt, whole allspice, and three or four bay leaves, add a cup full  of raspings, and let the whole stew gently for three or four hours,  according to the weight of the meat; this dish is excellent when cold.  A rump steak stewed in the same way will be found exceedingly fine.           *       *       *       *       *    KIMMEL MEAT.    Place a small piece of the rump of beef, or the under cut of a sirloin  in a deep pan with three pints of vinegar, two ounces of carraway  seeds tied in a muslin bag, salt, pepper, and spices, cover it down  tight, and bake thoroughly in a slow oven. This is a fine relish for  luncheons.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF AND BEANS.    Take a piece of brisket of beef, cover it with water, when boiling  skim off the fat, add one quarter of French beans cut small, two  onions cut in quarters, season with pepper and salt, and when nearly  done take a dessert-spoonful of flour, one of coarse brown sugar, and  a large tea-cup full of vinegar, mix them together and stir in with  the beans, and continue stewing for about half an hour longer.           *       *       *       *       *    KUGEL AND COMMEAN.    Soak one pint of Spanish peas and one pint of Spanish beans all night  in three pints of water; take two marrow bones, a calf's-foot, and  three pounds of fine gravy-beef, crack the bones and tie them to  prevent the marrow escaping, and put all together into a pan; then  take one pound of flour, half a pound of shred suet, a little grated  nutmeg and ground ginger, cloves and allspice, one pound of coarse  brown sugar, and the crumb of a slice of bread, first soaked in water  and pressed dry, mix all these ingredients together into a paste,  grease a quart basin and put it in, covering the basin with a plate  set in the middle of the pan with the beans, meat, &c. Cover the pan  lightly down with coarse brown paper, and let it remain all the night  and the next day, (until required) in a baker's oven, when done, take  out the basin containing the pudding, and skim the fat from the gravy  which must be served as soup; the meat, &c., is extremely savory and  nutritious, but is not a very seemly dish for table. The pudding must  be turned out of the basin, and a sweet sauce flavored with lemon and  brandy is a fine addition.           *       *       *       *       *    SAUER KRAUT.    Boil about seven or eight pounds of beef, either brisket or a fillet  off the shoulder, in enough water to cover it, when it has boiled for  one hour, add as much sauer kraut, which is a German preparation,  as may be approved, it should then stew gently for four hours and be  served in a deep dish. The Germans are not very particular in removing  the fat, but it is more delicate by so doing.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF WITH CELERY, AND WHITE BEANS AND PEAS.    Soak for twelve hours one pint of dried white peas, and half a pint of  the same kind of beans, they must be well soaked, and if very dry, may  require longer than twelve hours, put a nice piece of brisket of about  eight pounds weight in a stew-pan with the peas and beans, and three  heads of celery cut in small pieces, put water enough to cover, and  season with pepper and salt only, let it all stew slowly till the meat  is extremely tender and the peas and"]]]
