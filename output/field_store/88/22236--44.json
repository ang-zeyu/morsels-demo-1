And he kept on sinking  nearer to the earth, down, down, nearer and nearer--and then, quite  suddenly, he seemed to forget everything.    The next thing Neville remembered was feeling something wet and warm  upon his cheek. He opened his eyes and saw that the little dog was  licking his face. Sitting up, he looked about him. He was in the grass  on the top of the bald hill; night was very near, and the first star  was just beginning to twinkle.    Then, quite suddenly, Neville remembered the Cloud horse and the  little yellow man and the little silver man and the head scene-shifter  and the wonderful journey and all the rest of it.    \"Well, what a remarkable dream,\" said Neville, stretching his arms.  And, as he did so, the Sky Flower fell from his hand.    So it was not a dream after all; for, if it was, how could he explain  that Sky Flower? He picked it up and carried it very tenderly, as he  set off home to dinner, his little dog trotting at his heels.    \"What a beautiful flower!\" said Neville's mother when he got home.  \"Where ever did you get it?\"    \"It is a piece of the genuine sky,\" said Neville proudly, as he gave  it to her.    His mother smiled at him as she said, \"That is a very nice thing to  say, and it certainly does look like a little piece of the sky. But,  of course, it couldn't possibly be a real piece.\"    Then Neville knew that if he were to tell the story of his wonderful  ride, and tried to explain that he had been right around the world  since since he went out to play, his parents would find it very, very  hard to believe. So he said nothing, but ate a very good dinner.    But Neville's mother put the flower in a vase upon the mantel; and to  this day it is still there, as fresh and bright as ever. It will not  fade. Neville's mother thinks that is a very strange and wonderful  thing. And so it is.    Since that day, when Neville goes to the top of the bald hill to watch  a sunset, he is almost sure that, just as the golden light is fading,  he can see a little yellow man by the gateway; and it seems to him  that the little yellow man waves a cheery greeting. But, whether this  is so or not, Neville always waves back; and he feels very happy to  think that he has a good friend inside the sunset.        THE TRAM-MAN    I'd like to be a Tram-man, and ride about all day,  Calling out, \"Fares, please!\" in quite a 'ficious way,  With pockets full of pennies which I'd make the people pay.  But in the hottest days I'd take my tram down to the Bay;  And when I saw the nice cool sea I'd shout \"Hip, hip, hooray!\"  But I wouldn't be a Tram-man if. . . .                 I couldn't stop and play.                                     Would you?        THE AXE-MAN    High on the hills, where the tall trees grow,  There lives an axeman that I know.  From his little hut by a ferny creek,  Day after day, week after week,  He goes each morn with his shining axe,  Trudging along by the forest tracks;  And he chops and he chops     till the daylight goes--  High on the hills, where the blue-gum grows.    (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  There's a log to move and a branch to lop.  Now to the felling!  His sharp axe bites  Into a tree on the forest heights,  And scarce for a breath does the axeman stop--  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Bell-birds watch him; and in the fern  Wallabies listen awhile, and turn  Back through the bracken, and off they hop.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Patient and tireless, blow on blow  The axeman swings as the minutes go;  While the echoes ring from the mountain-top.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)    Round about him the rabbits play,  Skipping and scampering all the day,  And the sweet young grass by the logs they crop.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)    Crimson parrots above him climb,  Chattering, chattering all the time,  As down from the branches the twigs they drop.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip!          Chop!)  Steadily, surely, on he goes,  Shaking the tree with his mighty blows:  There's never a pause and there's never a stop.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)    Out from the bush beyond is heard  The swaggering song of the butcher-bird  Seeking a joint for his butcher's shop.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Deeper and deeper the cut creeps in,  While the parrots shriek with a deafening din,  And the chips fly out with a flip and a flop.  (Chip!     Chop!       Chip!      Chop!)  Yellow robins come  flocking round,  Watching the chips  as they fall to ground,  Darting to catch the grubs that drop.  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip!    . . Chop!)    The blows come quicker. The   axe-biade hums,  Stand well back, there, before she comes!  Hark! How the splinters crack and pop--  (Chip! . . Chop! . . Chip! . . Chop!)  Listen!  Listen!  She's creaking now!  Look, high up, at that trembling bough!  Another second, and down she'll smash,  Shaking the earth with a mighty crash;  Look at her! Look at her! (Chip!      Chop!  Chip! . . . . . . . .Chip!)                 Wee--E--E--E--E--E---                                                  FLOP!        THE DROVERS    Out across the spinifex, out across the sand,  Out across the saltbush to Never Never land     That's the way the drovers go, jogging down the track--     That's the way the drovers go. But how do they come back?  Back across the saltbush from Never Never land.  Back across the spinifex, back across the sand.        THE LONG ROAD HOME    When I go back from Billy's place I always have to roam  The mazy road, the crazy road that leads the long way home.  Ma always says, \"Why don't you come through Mr Donkin's land?  The footbridge track will bring you back.\" Ma doesn't understand.  I cannot go that way, you know, because of Donkin's dog;  So I set forth and travel north, and cross the fallen log.    Last week, when I was coming by, that log had lizards in it;  And you can't say I stop to play if I just search a minute.  I look around upon the ground and, if there are no lizards,  I go right on and reach the turn in front of Mrs Blizzard's.  I do not seek to cross the creek, because it's deep and floody,  And Ma would be annoyed with me if I came home all muddy.    Perhaps I throw a stone or so at Mrs Blizzard's tank,  Because it's great when I aim straight to hear the stone go \"Plank!\"  Then west I wend from Blizzard's Bend, and not a moment wait,  Except, perhaps, at Mr Knapp's, to swing upon his gate.  So up the hill I go, until I reach the little paddock  That Mr Jones at present owns and rents to Mr Craddock.    For boys my size the sudden rise is quite a heavy pull,  And yet I fear a short-cut here because of Craddock's bull;  So I just tease the bull till he's as mad as he can get,  And then I face the corner place that's been so long to let.  It's very well for Ma to tell about my dawdling habits.  What would you do, suppose you knew the place was thick with rabbits?    I do not stay for half a day, as Ma declares I do.  No, not for more than half-an-hour--perhaps an hour--or two.  Then down the drop I run, slip-slop, where all the road is slithy.  And have to go quite close, you know, to Mr Horner's smithy.  A moment I might tarry by the fence to watch them hammer,  And, I must say, learn more that way than doing sums and grammar.    And, if I do sometimes climb through, I do not mean to linger.  Though I did stay awhile the day Bill Homer burst his finger.  I just stand there to see the pair bang some hot iron thing  And watch Bill Horner swing the sledge and hit the anvil--Bing!  (For Mr Horner and his son are great big brawny fellows:  Both splendid chaps!) And then, perhaps, they let me blow the bellows.    A while I stop beside the shop, and talk to Mr Horner;  Then off I run, and race like fun around by Duggan's Corner.  It's getting late, and I don't wait beside the creek a minute,  Except to stop, maybe, and drop a few old pebbles in it.  A few yards more, and here's the store that's kept by Mr Whittle--  And you can't say I waste the day if I 'ust wait . . .  a little.    One day, you know, a year ago, a man gave me a penny,  And Mr Whittle sold me sweets (but not so very many).  You never know your luck, and so I look to see what's new  In Mr Whittle's window.  There's a peppermint or two,  Some buttons and tobacco (Mr Whittle calls it \"baccy\"),  And fish in tins, and tape, and pins. . . . And then a voice calls, \"Jacky!\"    \"I'm coming, Ma.  I've been so far-around by Duggan's Corner.  I had to stay awhile to say 'Good day' to Mr Horner.  I feel so fagged; I've tramped and dragged through mud and over logs, Ma--  I could not go short-cuts, you know, because of bulls and dogs, Ma.  The creek, Ma? Why, it's very high! You don't call that a gutter?  Bill Horner chews tobacco, Ma . . . . I'd like some bread and butter.\"        THE BAND    Hey, there!  Listen awhile!  Listen awhile, and come.  Down in the street there are marching feet, and I hear the beat of a drum.  Bim!  Boom!!  Out of the room!  Pick up your hat and fly!  Isn't it grand?  The band!  The band!  The band is marching by!    Oh, the clarinet is the finest yet, and the uniforms are gay.       Tah, rah!  We don't go home--       Oom, pah!  We won't go home--  Oh, we shan't go home, and we can't go home when the band begins to play.    Oh, see them swinging along, swinging along the street!  Left, right! buttons so bright, jackets and caps so neat.  Ho, the Fire Brigade, or a dress parade of the Soldier-men is grand;  But everyone, for regular fun, wants a Big-Brass-Band.    The slide-trombone is a joy alone, and the drummer!  He's a treat!       So, Rackety-rumph!  We don't go home--       Boom, Bumph!  We won't go home--  Oh, we shan't go home, and we can't go home while the band is in the street.       Tooral-ooral, Oom-pah!

'Will you make yourselves quite at home and help me to entertain these  other visitors till Johnny comes in?  I don't know what keeps him so  long.  If you'll excuse me I'll go and look for him.  There are the  pictures in the portfolio that you might like to show to these little  girls.  And there's the admiral, our redbird, and Bessie, the parrot.  Maybe they would like to look at them.'    \"The two girls whom she had designated as Jessica and Frances looked at  the strange children a minute but made no movement to carry out Mrs.  Morris' wishes.  Instead they drew a little apart and began to talk to  each other.  Mary Ethel, a round-faced girl who giggled a great deal  behind her fan, crossed over to where sat the large girl who had  mentioned the ice-cream, and started a conversation by remarking that  it was a warm day.  The girl made no audible answer, only nodded.    \"'Do you like to go to school?' inquired Mary Ethel.    \"The girl again nodded.  There was a little pause.  Mary Ethel, who was  bent on carrying out Mrs. Morris' suggestion to help her entertain  them, began again on the weather.  I suppose she couldn't think of  anything new to say, so she observed:    \"'It's a nice warm day for the first of September, don't you think?'    \"The girl's head once more wagged up and down in assent, but not a word  did she utter.  At this a subdued titter came from Frances and Jessica.  Mary Ethel's face grew red and she frowned at them.    \"Just at this moment in ran Johnny.  He had put on his best suit.  His  yellow hair was freshly brushed and his face was wreathed in smiles.  He reminded one of a dancing sunbeam.  It was wonderful to see how  quickly he set the social wheel moving in the parlor.  In three minutes  he had them all acquainted and talking to each other.  At one side I  noticed Naomi and Jessica who were trying to make the parrot talk for  the big girl.  Mary Ethel was turning the crank of a small music box,  around which were clustered a group of the stranger children.  On a  sofa three or four others had the portfolio of pictures spread out.  Others came to my cage coaxing me to whistle for them, while Johnny  capered hither and thither and joked and had more funny things to say  than anybody in the room.  When he let Bessie out of her cage and put  her on the piano to sing the 'Mocking Bird,' the joy of the visitors  knew no bounds.    \"'Have you a parrot, Jeannette?' he asked one of the little barefooted  girls, whose dancing black eyes showed how much she enjoyed Bessie's  performance.    \"'No, but I have two lovely cats.'  She made the announcement as if  very proud of their ownership.    \"'I have a cat too.   He dresses in black and wears long white  whiskers, and looks just like a respectable old colored man.'  This  description amused the children very much.    \"'What's your cat's name?' they shouted.    \"'Jett.  What do you call your cats, Jeannette?'    \"'The big one is _Boule de Neige_ and the little one is _Jaune  Jaquette_.'    \"'What queer names!'  exclaimed Mary Ethel.  'How did you happen to  select such names for them?'    \"'Oh, miss, because the names do suit them so well.'    \"'They don't sound like any cats' names that ever I heard.  I don't  understand how they would suit.'  Mary Ethel looked perplexed.    \"'Why, miss, on account of the color of those cats, to be sure,' said  Jeannette in surprise.    \"'Pooh!' explained Johnny, 'that's easy.  _Boule de neige_ is the  French for snowball, and _jaune_ means yellow, so _jaune jaquette_  means yellow jacket.  I learned that in our French reader.  I expect  one of the cats is all white and the other is a yellow one.  Is that  it, Jeannette?'    \"'Yes, sir,' said the French child, and she tipped him a polite little  bow that was very pretty indeed.    \"'_Boule de Neige_! what a funny name.  I haven't named our white  kitten yet.  I believe I'll call it _Boule de Neige_ for a change,'  said Karl.    \"Then Jett was brought in and Bessie pounced upon him for a ride, she  chuckling and singing and looking from side to side with proud  satisfaction, knowing she was being observed by everybody.  The  children almost screamed with delight at this performance.    \"'Now, Bessie,' said Johnny, as the poor cat at last shook her off and  slank away.  'You did that beautifully, and you deserve something to  eat.  I am going to let you have some bread and milk right here in the  parlor, and the company can see how nicely you can feed yourself with a  spoon.'    \"'All right,' croaked the parrot.  Sarah brought in a saucer in which  was a little bread moistened with milk, and two spoons with it.  A  cloth was spread over one corner of the table and Bessie crawled up to  the top of a chair which had been placed with its back close to the  table.  This brought the bird almost in line with the saucer.  Johnny  took his seat beside her and broke the bread into tiny pieces with his  spoon, shoving the particles into the other spoon as fast as Bessie  disposed of them.  She gravely clasped her spoon with one claw and  brought it to her mouth quite dextrously and ate the contents with  evident relish, though it was plain that she enjoyed being admired for  being able to do it really more than she enjoyed the bread.  Once in a  while her grasp was uncertain and the food was spilled on her breast  feathers or fell to the floor.  At this she scolded herself roundly and  seemed quite ashamed.    \"'One of these days, when I get time, I am going to train her to use a  napkin when she eats,' said Johnny.    \"'She'll be a perfectly accomplished lady then,' added Mary Ethel.    \"By this time some of the stranger children had left the table and had  come over to my cage to look at me.    \"'The admiral's an awful purty feller,' said one.    \"'Wouldn't his tail be sweet on a Sunday hat?' suggested another.    \"'Oh, I choose his wings for my hat,' exclaimed a third.    \"'I choose his head and breast for mine,' said the first one who had  spoken.  'And Naomi chooses his whole body for her hat, I expect,' she  added as Naomi joined them.    \"'No,' said Naomi, 'we don't wear birds any more in our family.  My  sister and I used to have our hats trimmed with them, but we've quit.  I had a lovely one on my blue velvet hat last year.  It was a beautiful  hat,\" and she smiled at the recollection.  'But we've quit now,' she  added gravely.    \"'Why?' asked the other girls in a breath.    \"'Oh, because my mother thinks it is wrong to wear them.  Little boy,  little boy, be careful or you'll let the bird out,' she called hastily.    \"But the warning was too late.  While the girls had been talking the  small boy who was with them had been entertaining himself by slightly  opening my cage door and letting it spring back to its fastening.  Suddenly he was seized with fright at discovering that it had stuck  while half-way back, and refused to come together.    \"Oh, dear!' he called.  'He's out.'    \"'Mercy on us!  Oh, dear!' screamed the girls as I made a dash through  the opening, and flew to the top of a picture frame.  'Johnny, Johnny,  your redbird's out,' they called.    \"All was confusion in an instant.  Boys and girls ran hither and  thither, tumbling over each other, and over the chairs and stools, and  all talking and screaming at once.    \"'Bring a broom or a flagpole, Johnny,' called Philip.  'I'll shoo him  down for you while you stand underneath and catch him.'    \"'Shoo, shoo!' said Jeannette, catching her dress skirt with both hands  and waving it back and forth rapidly.  In a minute all the girls were  waving their dress skirts at me and saying 'shoo.'    \"'Oh, my pretty Admiral Dewey, my dear old admiral,' wailed Johnny,  almost in tears.    \"I didn't wait for the broom or the flagpole to help me from the  picture frame.  I balanced myself steadily and then I flew out of the  open window and away into the world, without saying good-bye to  anybody.  I suppose they all crowded to the window to look after me as  I disappeared, for the last thing I heard was Mrs. Morris' voice  saying, 'Don't, Johnny; you'll fall out if you lean over so far.  Papa  will get you another bird.  Don't grieve so hard.  Don't, Johnny.'\"    \"Did you ever see Johnny afterward?\" we asked the redbird.    \"Yes, once I saw him cantering along slowly on Jock.  He could not go  very fast because he was holding a great bunch of red and pink roses in  one hand.  His cheeks were as pink as the flowers and his yellow hair  curled up under the edge of his cap the same as it used to.  I knew him  in a minute.  A great many carriages were on the street trimmed in  flags and flowers.  Little flags were fastened to the horses' harness.  Jock had one on each side of his head, which made him look very pretty.  Children were running about carrying wreaths.  On a corner of the  street where a band was playing some men were holding banners.  I heard  some one say it was Decoration Day, and that everybody strewed flowers  on the graves in the big cemetery that day.  I thought it was a very  beautiful custom.  Through all the buzz and confusion I kept an eye on  Johnny.  He didn't seem to be riding anywhere in particular, but was  just looking around for the fun of the thing.  Presently he drew up to  the sidewalk where a little ragged boy was leaning up against a tree.  He had a wistful look, as if he would like to be taking part.    \"'Hello!' said Johnny, as he reined Jock in.  'Aren't you going to help  to decorate?'    \"'Naw--ain't got any posies, I tell you.'  The boy said this in a  sullen tone.    \"'Here, take these.  I brought you a big bunch so you could divide 'em  with some of your friends.  There's enough for all of you boys to have  a few flowers to take to the cemetery.'  Johnny extended the roses with  a smile as he spoke.    \"The boy grabbed them eagerly.  'My!  You're a jolly one, I'll say that  for you,' he said heartily"]]]
