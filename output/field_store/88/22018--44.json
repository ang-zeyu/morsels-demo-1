On each such visit she  would act the tyrant, would storm and rage furiously, would subject him to  stinging rebukes and deliver biting tongue-lashings, causing him in  consequence to be much upset and nervous the rest of the day. The very  morning on which he had had the attack, which was followed by his present  trouble (partial aphonia and partial hemiplegia) his wife had paid him one  of these unusually stormy and noisy, and, to say the least, unwelcome  visits.  She had carried the attack to such a point that our patient became  so emotionally upset (he is a harmless, emotional, kindly, unassuming and  indifferent sort of old fellow) that he suddenly was attacked with nausea  and vomiting, and, frightened, fell to the floor, with the consequences  above detailed. I need not go further into the history and analysis of this  case, but the story thus far elicited is more than sufficient to show that  here we have a specific instance in which, by the analysis of a single  dream, we have arrived at the genesis of an hysterical paralytic syndrome of  four months' duration.  The analysis took but a few minutes. It may be  mentioned, in parentheses, that a full knowledge of the cause of the  condition did not lead to a disappearance of the palsy. In other words, as  we all know, knowledge per se does not lead to action or to the assertion or  development of the will-power. I may say, also, that the events here related  were not suppressed or repressed, for, as soon as the question of his wife  was taken up, the patient admitted that it was she who was the real cause of  his present conditions, and he thereupon detailed the story above related.  He assured me that he had always been fully aware that it was she who had  brought about his present condition, although, of course, he did not know  whether he had had an hysterical, apoplectic or other sort of attack. In  fact he believed his condition was permanent and incurable-- especially  since he had been treated at various neurological clinics for many weeks  past without the slightest improvement or progress.    Were we to follow up this history we could unearth the full life history of  this patient, including the genesis of his early attack of aphonia. But I  deem this unnecessary and inadvisable in this paper, as mentioned  previously.    Here, then, we have a definite case in which by the analysis of a single and  incidentally the first dream we have arrived at the genesis of the  psychoneurotic disorder.    From this same standpoint I have studied another case, a married woman of  twenty-nine, with marked neurasthenic and hysterical symptoms (including  astasia-abasia, anesthesias, palpitation of the heart, throbbing sensations  in the stomach and a great many other symptoms). This case I studied for  upwards of four months, with almost daily visits to the hospital where she  was being cared for.  I made quite an intensive study of her dream life and  of her past life history, and I find that had I taken the very first dream  which I obtained from her and conducted a thorough analysis with this dream  as my first mile-post, I would have arrived at a full genesis of the  condition, which was of ten years' duration.  In this case, also, I must  repeat, there was no indication of repression, the patient having always  understood very well the origin and cause of her condition. Here, too, we  find that the knowledge alone did not lead to her recovery. This case I  shall report in detail at a later date.    In this connection, I cannot keep from reciting the dream of a young girl of  twelve which I had the good fortune to study. She came to me complaining  about her throat.  There was something dry, \"a sticking\" in her throat.  She  did not know what it was. Would I look at her throat?  I found nothing  abnormal, and was about to dismiss her when I observed that her hands were  bluish. I felt them.  They were cold.  I thought at once of probable heart  disease.  I was soon informed that she had heart disease. She had been told  so by other doctors.  This proved to be the case, as I learned on examining  her.    Being keenly interested in this subject of dreams, I wondered whether, if  she were subject to periods of cardiac decompensation of varying degree, she  did not have dreams of a terrifying nature (about burglars, robbery and the  like), because of embarrassment of breathing during sleep, resulting from  her cardiac insufficiency and consequent circulatory and respiratory  disturbance. I asked her whether she had been dreaming much of late. She  told me she had had a dream the preceding night. What was it?  I inquired.    She had dreamed that she had died.  Her mother had put her in a coffin,  carried her to the cemetery and then proceeded to bury her.  Her mother had  first forced something into her mouth (it seemed to be a whitish powder),  and then lowered her into the grave and filled the grave with dirt. That is  all that she could remember.    I shall not enter into a complete analysis or interpretation of this dream.  There is no doubt, however, to every psychoanalyst who has devoted his  attention to dreams, that the analysis of such a dream should prove most  interesting.  It is also apparent that by taking up the various elements of  the dream and following them untiringly along the various trails and  ramifications which lead on in various directions, one could unmask the  entire life history of this twelve-year-old girl.    I wish, however, to direct the reader's attention to only one aspect of this  dream--the death of the dreamer. She denied that she feared death or that  she thought of death because of her heart disease or from any other cause. I  next inquired:  \"Do you wish or have you ever wished you were dead?\"  The  reaction of the girl was immediate and intense. She stood frightened,  embarrassed; her eyelids twitched convulsively in rapid succession, her face  gradually assumed a suppressed crying expression, tears came to her eyes,  they soon flowed freely and rolled down her cheeks; she sobbed, and, through  her tears, she uttered, almost inarticulately, the one word, \"Yes.\"  A  convulsive, inspiratory grunt, a bashful, receding, turning away of the head  and body, a raising of the hands to cover her face and hide her tears, and  hasty, running steps to get away, while murmuring audibly \"Let me go away,\"  followed rapidly one upon the other. I gently seized her hand, calmed and  reassured her. And, through sobs and tears, in almost inaudible tones, in  starts and spurts, and reluctantly replying to questions which were forced  upon her, producing replies which were literally drawn from her against her  will, she told me this little story: A little boy cousin of hers, three  years her junior, had begun school two years or so later than she, and yet,  in spite of this handicap, this little relative had outstripped her in  school, he being now in a higher grade than she herself was. She would not  be so much concerned or worried about this not-to-be-proud-of performance,  had not the boy's mother that week visited her home and there, in the  presence of other people, talked considerably about her boy's progress in  school, his rapid advance as compared with that of our little dreamer, her  relative stupidity and backwardness.  And so this boy's mother had continued  for some time in the same strain. This caused our little girl to feel much  embarrassed--in fact, ashamed and mortified.  She had felt that way for  several days past, it had made her cry, had made her feel miserable and  unhappy; so much so that she had wished she were dead. I shall not continue  this analysis further.  But it is plainly seen that here too, by a single  dream, we have come upon life-experiences, viewpoints and mental material  which affords us efficient and sufficient weapons to boldly attack the  fortress of her full life history, her mental qualities, her trends, her  psychic depth, her mental makeup in its entirety, in its every dimension.    It is interesting to note that on the morning following the experience which  I had with this child, she came to see me a second time, and, on my  examining her throat, it presented the typical picture of bilateral  tonsillitis, the final result of the initial sticking sensation in her  throat, which she had experienced the day before.  After taking a culture  from her throat as a matter of routine to exclude a possible diphtheria, the  patient, greatly disturbed because of her newly-discovered trouble, burst  forth into bitter tears, and, still sobbing, rushed abruptly from the room.    A week later, when I saw her again, she had regained her emotional  equilibrium and we reviewed her dream and its analysis without any special  signs of emotional disturbance.    Very interesting, also, was my experience about a week following this when,  casually reciting this little girl's dream, its significance and her  conduct, to an old lady whom I know very well, I found that she too was  presenting all the signs of emotional upset, for, as I proceeded with my  recital, tears gradually came to her eyes, her face assumed a suppressed  crying expression, she tried to smile through her tears, and finally, unable  to control her emotions, she broke out into a free and unrestrained weeping  spell, following which I learned from her that the recital of this girl's  condition, her dream and its meaning, recalled to her mind her darling  daughter, a noble girl of sixteen years of age, who had died some fifteen  years ago, after a long period of incapacitation and a miserable existence  brought on by tonsillitis, chorea, rheumatism and, finally, heart disease,  with all the extreme signs and symptoms of broken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12261"],[0,"Balder the Beautiful, Volume I.

Outside  the fence of the enclosure every lad deposits his bamboo on a couple of  forked sticks and covers it up with nut leaves.[23] Among the Carrier  Indians of North-Western America, who burned their dead, the ashes of a  chief used to be placed in a box and set on the top of a pole beside his  hut: the box was never allowed to touch the ground.[24] In the Omaha  tribe of North American Indians the sacred clam shell of the Elk clan  was wrapt up from sight in a mat, placed on a stand, and never suffered  to come in contact with the earth.[25] The Cherokees and kindred Indian  tribes of the United States used to have certain sacred boxes or arks,  which they regularly took with them to war. Such a holy ark consisted of  a square wooden box, which contained \"certain consecrated vessels made  by beloved superannuated women, and of such various antiquated forms, as  would have puzzled Adam to have given significant names to each.\" The  leader of a war party and his attendant bore the ark by turns, but they  never set it on the ground nor would they themselves sit on the bare  earth while they were carrying it against the enemy. Where stones were  plentiful they rested the ark on them; but where no stones were to be  found, they deposited it on short logs. \"The Indian ark is deemed so  sacred and dangerous to be touched, either by their own sanctified  warriors, or the spoiling enemy, that they durst not touch it upon any  account. It is not to be meddled with by any, except the war chieftain  and his waiter, under the penalty of incurring great evil. Nor would the  most inveterate enemy touch it in the woods, for the very same reason.\"  After their return home they used to hang the ark on the leader's  red-painted war pole.[26] At Sipi, near Simla, in Northern India, an  annual fair is held, at which men purchase wives. A square box with a  domed top figures prominently at the fair. It is fixed on two poles to  be carried on men's shoulders, and long heavily-plaited petticoats hang  from it nearly to the ground. Three sides of the box are adorned with  the head and shoulders of a female figure and the fourth side with a  black yak's tail. Four men bear the poles, each carrying an axe in his  right hand. They dance round, with a swinging rhythmical step, to the  music of drums and a pipe. The dance goes on for hours and is thought to  avert ill-luck from the fair. It is said that the box is brought to  Simla from a place sixty miles off by relays of men, who may not stop  nor set the box on the ground the whole way.[27] In Scotland, when water  was carried from sacred wells to sick people, the water-vessel might not  touch the earth.[28] In some parts of Aberdeenshire the last bunch of  standing corn, which is commonly viewed as very sacred, being the last  refuge of the corn-spirit retreating before the reapers, is not suffered  to touch the ground; the master or \"gueedman\" sits down and receives  each handful of corn as it is cut on his lap.[29]    [Sacred food not allowed to touch the earth.]    Again, sacred food may not under certain circumstances be brought into  contact with the earth. Some of the aborigines of Victoria used to  regard the fat of the emu as sacred, believing that it had once been the  fat of the black man. In taking it from the bird or giving it to another  they handled it reverently. Any one who threw away the fat or flesh of  the emu was held accursed. \"The late Mr. Thomas observed on one  occasion, at Nerre-nerre-Warreen, a remarkable exhibition of the effects  of this superstition. An aboriginal child--one attending the  school--having eaten some part of the flesh of an emu, threw away the  skin. The skin fell to the ground, and this being observed by his  parents, they showed by their gestures every token of horror. They  looked upon their child as one utterly lost. His desecration of the bird  was regarded as a sin for which there was no atonement.\"[30] The  Roumanians of Transylvania believe that \"every fresh-baked loaf of  wheaten bread is sacred, and should a piece inadvertently fall to the  ground, it is hastily picked up, carefully wiped and kissed, and if  soiled, thrown into the fire--partly as an offering to the dead, and  partly because it were a heavy sin to throw away or tread upon any  particle of it.\"[31] At certain festivals in south-eastern Borneo the  food which is consumed in the common house may not touch the ground;  hence, a little before the festivals take place, foot-bridges made of  thin poles are constructed from the private dwellings to the common  house.[32] When Hall was living with the Esquimaux and grew tired of  eating walrus, one of the women brought the head and neck of a reindeer  for him to eat. This venison had to be completely wrapt up before it was  brought into the house, and once in the house it could only be placed on  the platform which served as a bed. \"To have placed it on the floor or  on the platform behind the fire-lamp, among the walrus, musk-ox, and  polar-bear meat which occupy a goodly portion of both of these places,  would have horrified the whole town, as, according to the actual belief  of the Innuits, not another walrus could be secured this year, and there  would ever be trouble in catching any more.\"[33] But in this case the  real scruple appears to have been felt not so much at placing the  venison on the ground as at bringing it into contact with walrus  meat.[34]    [Magical implements and remedies thought to lose their virtue by contact  with the ground.]    Sometimes magical implements and remedies are supposed to lose their  virtue by contact with the ground, the volatile essence with which they  are impregnated being no doubt drained off into the earth. Thus in the  Boulia district of Queensland the magical bone, which the native  sorcerer points at his victim as a means of killing him, is never by any  chance allowed to touch the earth.[35] The wives of rajahs in Macassar,  a district of southern Celebes, pride themselves on their luxuriant  tresses and are at great pains to oil and preserve them. Should the hair  begin to grow thin, the lady resorts to many devices to stay the ravages  of time; among other things she applies to her locks a fat extracted  from crocodiles and venomous snakes. The unguent is believed to be very  efficacious, but during its application the woman's feet may not come  into contact with the ground, or all the benefit of the nostrum would be  lost.[36] Some people in antiquity believed that a woman in hard labour  would be delivered if a spear, which had been wrenched from a man's body  without touching the ground, were thrown over the house where the  sufferer lay. Again, according to certain ancient writers, arrows which  had been extracted from a body without coming into contact with the  earth and laid under sleepers, acted as a love-charm.[37] Among the  peasantry of the north-east of Scotland the prehistoric weapons called  celts went by the name of \"thunderbolts\" and were coveted as the sure  bringers of success, always provided that they were not allowed to fall  to the ground.[38]    [Serpents eggs or Snake Stones.]    In ancient Gaul certain glass or paste beads attained great celebrity as  amulets under the name of serpents' eggs; it was believed that serpents,  coiling together in a wriggling, writhing mass, generated them from  their slaver and shot them into the air from their hissing jaws. If a  man was bold and dexterous enough to catch one of these eggs in his  cloak before it touched the ground, he rode off on horseback with it at  full speed, pursued by the whole pack of serpents, till he was saved by  the interposition of a river, which the snakes could not pass. The proof  of the egg being genuine was that if it were thrown into a stream it  would float up against the current, even though it were hooped in gold.  The Druids held these beads in high esteem; according to them, the  precious objects could only be obtained on a certain day of the moon,  and the peculiar virtue that resided in them was to secure success in  law suits and free access to kings. Pliny knew of a Gaulish knight who  was executed by the emperor Claudius for wearing one of these  amulets.[39] Under the name of Snake Stones (_glain neidr_) or Adder  Stones the beads are still known in those parts of our own country where  the Celtic population has lingered, with its immemorial superstitions,  down to the present or recent times; and the old story of the origin of  the beads from the slaver of serpents was believed by the modern  peasantry of Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland as by the Druids of ancient  Gaul. In Cornwall the time when the serpents united to fashion the beads  was commonly said to be at or about Midsummer Eve; in Wales it was  usually thought to be spring, especially the Eve of May Day, and even  within recent years persons in the Principality have affirmed that they  witnessed the great vernal congress of the snakes and saw the magic  stone in the midst of the froth. The Welsh peasants believe the beads to  possess medicinal virtues of many sorts and to be particularly  efficacious for all maladies of the eyes. In Wales and Ireland the beads  sometimes went by the name of the Magician's or Druid's Glass (_Gleini  na Droedh_ and _Glaine nan Druidhe_). Specimens of them may be seen in  museums; some have been found in British barrows. They are of glass of  various colours, green, blue, pink, red, brown, and so forth, some plain  and some ribbed. Some are streaked with brilliant hues. The beads are  perforated, and in the Highlands of Scotland the hole is explained by  saying that when the bead has just been conflated by the serpents  jointly, one of the reptiles sticks his tail through the still viscous  glass. An Englishman who visited Scotland in 1699 found many of these  beads in use throughout the country. They were hung from children's  necks to"]]]
