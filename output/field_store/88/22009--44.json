The general looked with wondering admiration at this young and beautiful  woman, who claimed to be the mother of a lad grown up to manhood. Her  enchanting face beamed with youth and beauty, and a sea of warmth and  passion streamed from her large, dark eyes, while the gentle,  love-enticing smile that played around her mouth revealed the tender  feminine gentleness and amiability of her disposition. Bonaparte had  never mastered the art of flattering women in the light, frivolous style  of the fashionable coxcomb; and when he attempted it his compliments  were frequently of so unusual and startling a character that they might  just as well contain an affront as a tribute of eulogy.    \"Ah! ah! How striking that looks!\" he once said, while he was emperor,  to the charming Duchess de Chevreuse. \"What remarkable red hair  you have!\"    \"Possibly so, sire,\" she replied, \"but this is the first time that a  man ever told me so.\"    And the duchess was right; for her hair was not red, but of a very  handsome blond[3].    [Footnote 3: The Duchess de Chevreuse was shortly afterward banished to  Tours, because she refused to serve us a lady of honor to the Queen  of Spain.]    To another lady, whose round, white arms pleased him, he once said: \"Ah,  good Heavens, what red arms you have!\" Then, again, to another: \"What  beautiful hair you have; but what an ugly head-dress that is! Who could  have put it up for you in such ridiculous style?\"    Bonaparte, as I have said, did not know how to compliment women with  words; but Josephine well understood the flattering language that his  eyes addressed to her. She knew that she had, in that very hour,  conquered the bold young lion, and she felt proud and happy at the  thought; for the unusually imposing appearance of the young hero had  awakened her own heart, which she had thought was dead, to livelier  palpitations.    From that time forth they saw each other more frequently, and, ere long,  Josephine heard from Bonaparte's own lips the glowing confession of his  love. She reciprocated it, and promised him her hand. In vain her  powerful friends, Tallien and Barras, endeavored to dissuade her from  marrying this young, penniless general; in vain did they remind her that  he might be killed in the very next battle, and that she might thus  again be left a reduced widow. Josephine shook her handsome curls with  a peculiar smile. Perhaps she was thinking of the prophecy of the  negress at Martinique; perhaps she had read in the fiery glances of  Bonaparte's eye, and on his broad, thoughtful brow, that he might be the  very man to bring that prophecy to its consummation; perhaps she loved  him ardently enough to prefer an humble lot, when shared with him, to  any richer or more brilliant alliance. The representations of her  friends did not frighten her away, and she remained firm in her  determination to become the wife of the young general, poor as he was.  Their wedding-day was fixed, and both hastened with joyous impatience to  make their modest little preparations for their new housekeeping  establishment. Yet Bonaparte had not been able to complete his dream of  happiness; he possessed neither house nor carriage, and Josephine, too,  was without an equipage.    Thus both of them often had to content themselves with going on foot  through the streets, and it may be that, in this halcyon period of their  felicity, they regarded the circumstance rather as a favor than as a  scurvy trick of Fortune. Their tender and confidential communications  were not disturbed by the loud rattle of the wheels, and they were not  obliged to interrupt their sweet interchange of sentiment while getting  into and out of a vehicle. Arm-in-arm, they strolled together along the  promenades, he smiling proudly when the passers-by broke out in  spontaneous exclamations of delight at Josephine's beauty, and she happy  and exultant as she overheard the whispered admiration and respect with  which the multitude everywhere greeted Bonaparte, as she pressed with  the general through the throng.    One day, Bonaparte accompanied the viscountess on a visit to Ragideau,  the smallest man but the greatest lawyer in Paris. He had been the  business attorney of the Beauharnais family for a long time, and  Josephine now wished to withdraw from his hands, for her own disposal, a  sum of money belonging to her that had been deposited with him.  Bonaparte remained in the anteroom while Josephine went into the  adjoining apartment, which was Ragideau's office.    \"I have come to tell you that I am going to marry again,\" said  Josephine, with her winning smile, to Ragideau.    The little attorney gave a friendly nod, as he replied: \"You do well,  and I congratulate you with all my heart, viscountess, for I am  satisfied that you have made no other than a worthy choice.\"    \"Undoubtedly, a very worthy choice,\" exclaimed Josephine, with the proud  and happy look of a person really in love. \"My future husband is General  Bonaparte!\"    The little great man (of a lawyer) fairly started with alarm. \"How?\"  said he, \"You!--the Viscountess Beauharnais, you--marry this little  General Bonaparte, this general of the republic, which has already  deposed him once, and may depose him again to-morrow, and throw him back  into insignificance?\"    Josephine's only reply was this: \"I love him.\"    \"Yes you love him, now,\" exclaimed Ragideau, warmly. \"But you are wrong  in marrying him, and you will one day, rue it. You are committing a  folly, viscountess, for you want to marry a man who has nothing but his  hat and his sword.\"    \"But who also has a future,\" said Josephine, gayly, and then, turning  the conversation, she began to speak of the practical matters that had  brought her thither.    When her business with the notary had been concluded, Josephine returned  to the anteroom where Bonaparte was waiting for her. He came, smiling,  to meet her, but, at the same moment, he gave the notary, who was with  her, so fierce and wrathful a glance that the latter shrank back in  consternation. Josephine also remarked that Bonaparte's countenance was  paler that day than usual, and that he was less communicative and less  disposed to chat with her; but she had already learned that it was not  advisable to question him as to the cause of his different moods. So,  she kept silent on that score, and her cheerfulness and amiability soon  drove away the clouds that had obscured the general's brow.    The nuptials of Bonaparte and Josephine followed, on the 9th of March,  1796; and the witnesses, besides Eugene and Hortense, Josephine's  children, were Barras, Jean Lemarois, Tallien, Calmelet, and Leclerq.  The marriage-contract contained, along with the absolutely requisite  facts of the case, a very pleasant piece of flattery for Josephine,  since, in order to establish an equality of ages between the two  parties, Bonaparte had himself put down a year older, and Josephine four  years younger, than they really were. Bonaparte was not, as the contract  states, born on the 5th of February, 1768 but on the 15th of August,  1769; and Josephine not, as the document represents, on the 23d of July,  1767, but on the 23d of June, 1763[4].    [Footnote 4: Bourrienne, vol. i., p. 350.]    Josephine acknowledged this gallant act of her young spouse in queenly  fashion, for she brought him, as her wedding-gift, his appointment to  the command of the Italian army, which Barras and Tallien had granted to  her, at her own request.    But, before the young bridegroom repaired to his new scene of activity,  there to win fresh laurels and renown, he passed a few happy weeks with  his lovely wife and his new family, in the small residence in the Rue  Chautereine, which he had purchased a short time before his marriage,  and which Josephine had fitted up with that elevated and refined good  taste that had always distinguished her.    One-half of Bonaparte's darling wish was at length fulfilled. He had his  house, which was large enough to receive his friends. There was now only  a carriage to be procured in order to make the general the \"happiest  of men.\"    But, as the wishes of men always aspire still farther the farther they  advance, Bonaparte was no longer content with the possession of a small  house in Paris. He now wanted an establishment in the country also.    \"Look me up a little place in your beautiful valley of the Yonne,\" he  wrote about this time to Bourrienne, who was then living on his property  near Sens; \"and as soon as I get the money, I will buy it. Then I will  retire to it. Now, don't forget that I do not want any of the national  domains[5].\"    [Footnote 5: Bourrienne, vol. i., p. 103.]    As for the carriage, the peace of Campo Formio brought the victorious  General Bonaparte a magnificent team of six gray horses, which was a  present to the general of the French Republic from the Emperor of  Austria, who did not dream that, scarcely ten years later, he would have  him for a son-in-law.    These superb grays, however, were--excepting the laurels of Arcola,  Marengo, and Mantua, the only spoils of war that Bonaparte brought back  with him from his famous Italian campaign--the only gift which the  general had not refused to accept.    It is true that the six grays could not be very conveniently hitched to  a simple private carriage, but they had an imposing look attached to the  gilded coach of state in which, a year later, the first consul made his  solemn entry into the Tuileries.        CHAPTER VI.    BONAPARTE IN ITALY.    Josephine, now the wife of General Bonaparte, had but a few weeks in  which to enjoy her new happiness, and then remained alone in Paris,  doubly desolate, because she had to be separated, not only from her  husband, but from her children. Eugene accompanied his young"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12027"],[0,"Crime: Its Cause and Treatment (#7)"],[1,"in this kind of a life. The adjustment of  heredity and environment is not an easy task to one who lives an  unsheltered life. The ordinary person, thrown on his own resources, is  poorly equipped for existence. His opinions on most matters are not  sound. He uses poor judgment as to how he shall spend the little money  he gets. He is generally driven by debts and harassed in all his efforts  to get a living. A large family adds to his trouble and his existence is  a constant struggle with what, to him, is an almost hopeless fate.    Industrial conditions for the most part are relentless and hard. The  poor man is thrown into competition with his fellows for work. He may  get along when work is easy to get and wages are good, but in dull times  he falls behind, and is in hopeless trouble. His life is a long, hard  struggle to make adjustments to his environment, and it is not strange  that he goes down so often before the heavy task. Failure to make proper  adjustments directly and indirectly often means prison to him.    Again, the ordinary and especially the weak man is hopelessly puzzled by  his environment. It must never be overlooked that man has a lowly  origin. The marks of his humble birth are in his whole structure and  life. His make-up has been the work of the ages. He is a late  development of a life that knew nothing of law, as law is understood  today. His ancestors were hungry and went out after food, they killed  their prey and took their food by main strength whenever they had the  power. They were subject to certain customs which were very strict, but  which were few and did not seriously complicate life. They knew only the  law of force. Their existence was simple and primal, and they were  governed by no \"rights,\" except such simple ones as were made by might  and custom.    Civilization is a constant building-up of limitations around heredity; a  persistent growth of environmental control as it progresses, or at least  moves along. This structure, especially the legal structure, is built by  the more intelligent and always by the strong men. It is always shifting  and moving, and it is impossible for the inferior man to adjust his  emotions and his life rapidly to the changes. Things which are not  condemned by his feelings of right and wrong are condemned by laws that  meet with no response from his emotions and moral ideas. To him at least  these are not different from the things that are done by others with  impunity and without rebuke. Especially is this true of the rapidly  growing class of property laws that have had no counterpart in the early  history of man. This list has grown so fast that it is beyond the power  of a large class of men to find in their feelings any response to many  of these criminal statutes. The ever-growing social restrictions are of  the same modern growth, and it is equally impossible to feel and  understand them. What we call civilization has moved so fast that the  structure and instincts of man have not been able to become adjusted to  it. The structure is too cumbersome, too intense, too hard, and if not  breaking down of its own weight, it is at least destroying thousands who  cannot adjust themselves to its changing demands. Not only are the  effects of this growing body of social and legal restrictions shown  directly by their constant violation, generally by the inferior and the  poor, but indirectly in their strain on the nervous system; by the  irritation and impatience that they generate, and which, under certain  conditions cause acts of violence.          VI    PSYCHOLOGY OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT      No one can understand conduct without knowing something of the  psychology of human action. First of all, it must be understood that  reason, which so many have idealized and placed in control of the human  machine, has little to do with the actions of men. It is a common habit  with most men to find fault with and bewail the fact that human beings  do not act from reason. However much the truth is impressed upon us, we  never seem to realize that the basis of action is in instinct and  emotion. It is really useless to quarrel with Nature. Whether it would  have been better to have made man some other way is not worth  discussing. He has been evolved in a certain way and we must take him as  he is. Our impatience with the method that Nature has provided for  influencing human conduct is largely due to our idea of the meaning of  life.    Man has fancied himself in a position in the animal world that facts of  life and nature do not sustain. We seem to feel that man has some high  calling; that he should make something of himself which cannot be  accomplished; that he should form some sort of a perfect order that he  never can reach; in short that man has a purpose and a mission. It is  manifest that all we know is but a mite compared with the unknown, and  it may be that sometime a purpose will be revealed of which man never  dreamed. Still from all that we can see and understand, Nature has but  one desire, and that is the preservation and perpetuation of life. This  is its purpose or, rather, its strongest urge not only with men but with  all animal life. Sometimes to create one fish a million eggs are  spawned. Nature is profligate both in spawning life and compassing its  destruction. In the human species the capacity for life is immeasurably  beyond its fruition. A large portion of those who are born die an early  death. And that human life shall not be extinct, Nature plants the  life-giving desire deep in the constitution of man. The creation of life  comes from an instinct so profound and absorbing that it carries a train  of evils in its wake. Many are overweighted by the sex instinct to their  positive harm. Nature somehow did not trust such a fundamental duty as  the preservation of the race to reason. If intellectual processes were  responsible for life, the world no doubt would soon be bare of animate  things. Neither could the care of the young be trusted to anything but  the deep-seated instinct that causes the mother to forget her own life  in the preservation of the life of her child.    The functions of body, on which life is founded, do not depend upon  reason. The heart begins to beat before birth; it continues to beat  until the end of life. The reason has nothing to do with the heart  performing its function. Man goes to sleep at night confident that it  will still be beating in the morning. The blood circulates in the veins  independent of the thoughts of man. The digestive processes go on  whether he sleeps or is awake. Many of his muscles never rest from birth  to death. Life could not be preserved through the intellectual  processes.    Human action is governed largely by instinct and emotion. These  instincts and emotions are incident to every living machine and are the  motor forces that impel the organism. They do not think. They act, and  act at once. All the mind can do is to place some restraint on such  instincts and emotions through experience, education and settled habits.  If the actions are never inhibited, the machine will tear itself to  pieces. If too easily inhibited, it will do no work. It is manifest that  the perfect machine does not exist.    Man is moved by his instinct of flight and his emotion of fear, which  are set in motion by apprehended dangers and by unaccustomed sights or  sounds. Terror sometimes becomes so intense that it prevents flight and  brings convulsions and death. It is idle to reason with one in terror.  It is idle to reason with a mob in terror or a nation in terror. One  might as well expect to calm a tempestuous sea with soft words.    The instinct of repulsion brings hatred and dislike and, combined with  the instinct of pugnacity, may lead to crimes of violence. When these  instincts are strong enough, the weak and superficial barriers cannot  stand against them. An electrical flash showing the scaffold with the  noose above it would have no force to stop an instinct and emotion fully  aroused. Through seeing, feeling, hearing, tasting or smelling, some  instinct is called into action. Many times several conflicting instincts  are aroused. The man is like a tree bent back and forth by the storm. If  the storm is hard enough, sooner or later it will break. Which way the  tree falls has nothing to do with the consciousness of the tree, but has  to do only with the direction of the prevailing and controlling force.    The instinct of gregariousness draws animals or men together into  communities and close relations. This is one of the strongest instincts  and not only preserves life but is fundamental to those human  associations that are the basis of civilization. Except for this,  animals would live a lonely life and probably perish from the earth.  Through this instinct, man builds his villages and cities and organizes  his states and nations. With the gregarious instinct and the parental  instinct drawing men together, and the instincts and emotions of flight,  fear and pugnacity, repelling and pushing them apart, conflict is  inevitable. All that can be done is to create and cultivate as strong  habits, customs and laws as possible to stand against the power of  instinct and emotion in time of need, and to remove the main inciting  causes so far as man has the intelligence and power to remove them. It  is evident that this can never be complete. There are too many weak  machines, too many defective nervous systems, too many badly organized  brains. Accidents are inevitable, and some accidents are called  \"crimes.\" When the accident is international or world-wide, it means  war. Those who believe that there is any power to stop all the harmful  manifestations of man's instincts, either individually or _en masse_, do  not understand the fundamental nature of man.    Many and probably all instincts work both for good and ill. Flight,  pugnacity, repulsion, sex--all are life-pr"]]]
