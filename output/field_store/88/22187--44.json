The wave, of  course growing less in intensity, traveled across the whole Indian  Ocean, 5,000 miles, to the Cape of Good Hope and around it into the  Atlantic. The waves in the atmosphere traveled around the globe three  times at the rate of 700 miles per hour. The dust from the volcano was  carried up into the atmosphere fully twenty miles and the finest of it  was distributed through the whole body of air. The reader doubtless  remembers the beautiful reddish or purple glow at sunrise and sunset  for fully six months after August, 1883--that glow was caused by  volcanic dust in the atmosphere interfering with the passage of the  sun's rays of the upper part of the solar spectrum, more manifest at  sun rising and setting than at other times during the day, because at  these periods the sun's rays have to travel obliquely through the  atmosphere, and consequently penetrating a very deep layer, were  deprived of all their colors except the red.    The loss of life was appalling. The last sight on earth to 35,000  people was that of the awful eruption. Engulfed in the ocean or  covered with heaps of ashes, a few hours after the eruption commenced  the awful work was done, and that vast multitude had vanished from off  the face of the earth. The fact that in the neighborhood of the  mountain there was a sparse population accounts for there not being  even a far greater loss of life.    Notwithstanding the awfulness of volcanic and earthquake phenomena,  there is some silver lining to the dark clouds. They prove that the  earth is yet a _living_ planet. Centuries must pass away before it  will become like the moon--a dead planet--without water, air or life.  Our satellite is a prophecy indeed of what the earth must eventually  become when all its life forces, its internal energies, are dissipated  into space.--_Granville F. Foster, Min. Sci. Press_.           *       *       *       *       *          PENTAPTERYGIUM SERPENS.      This is one of five species of Himalayan plants which, until recently,  were included in the genus vaccinium. The new name for them is ugly  enough to make one wish that they were vacciniums still.  Pentapterygium serpens is the most beautiful of the lot, and, so far  as I know, this and P. rugosum are the only species in cultivation in  England. The former was collected in the Himalayas about ten years ago  by Captain Elwes, who forwarded it to Kew, where it grows and flowers  freely under the same treatment as suits Cape heaths. Sir Joseph  Hooker says it is abundant on the Sikkim mountains at from 3,000 to  8,000 feet elevation, and that it usually grows on the stout limbs of  lofty trees. In this it resembles many of the rhododendrons of that  region, and it has been suggested that they are epiphytic from force  of circumstances, not from choice. On the ground they would have no  chance against the other vegetation, which would strangle or starve  them out. Remove them from this struggle for existence, and they at  once show their preference for rich soil and plenty of it. All the  pentapterygiums have the lower part of the stem often swelling out  into a prostrate trunk, as thick as a man's leg sometimes, and sending  out stout branching roots which cling tightly round the limbs of the  tree upon which it grows. These swollen stems are quite succulent, and  they serve as reservoirs of moisture and nourishment. In the wet  season they push out new shoots, from which grow rapidly wands three  or four feet long, clothed with box-like leaves, and afterward with  numerous pendulous flowers. These are elegant in shape and richly  colored. They are urn-shaped, with five ribs running the whole length  of the corolla, and their color is bright crimson with deeper colored  V-shaped veins, as shown in the illustration of the flowers of almost  natural size. They remain fresh upon the plant for several weeks. The  beautiful appearance of a well grown specimen when in flower may be  seen from the accompanying sketch of the specimen at Kew, which was at  its best in July, and remained in bloom until the middle of September.      [Illustration: PENTAPTERYGIUM SERPENS (FLOWERS NEARLY NATURAL SIZE)]    P. rugosum is also grown as a greenhouse plant at Kew, where it has  been in cultivation about twenty years. It has larger leaves and a  more bushy habit than P. serpens, while the flowers are produced in  fascicles on the old wood. They are as large as those here figured,  but differ in color, being whitish, with brown-red V-shaped marks.  Both species may be propagated from cuttings. The plants thrive in  sandy peat, and they like plenty of moisture at all times.--_W.  Watson, in The Gardeners' Magazine_.

The subject of the relations and adaptations which exist between  flowers and insects does not appear to excite as much popular  attention as many other branches of natural science which are no more  interesting. Sprengel, Darwin, and Hermann Muller have been the chief  authors in giving us our present knowledge and interest in the study;  Sir John Lubbock has helped to popularize it, and Prof. W. Trelease  and others have carried on the work in this country.    The perforation as well as the fertilization of flowers has received  attention, but there is a wide field for further study for those who  have leisure to pursue it, as it requires much time and patience, as  well as closeness and accuracy of observation.    The accompanying figures, from drawings by Mr. C.E. Faxon, show a few  characteristic perforations and mutilations, and also represent two of  the principal kinds of insects which make them.    Any one interested in the subject will find an excellent brief review  of the work already done, a fair bibliography, and a list of  perforated flowers in Professor L.H. Pammel's paper on the  \"Perforation of Flowers,\" in the _Transactions of the St. Louis  Academy of Science_, vol. v., pp. 246-277.    The general beauty of flowers is usually not greatly marred by the  perforations except in a few cases, as when the spurs of columbines  and corollas of trumpet creepers are much torn, which frequently  happens.    The great object of the perforations by insects is the obtaining of  the concealed nectar in an easy way. Very naturally, flowers which  depend on insect agency for fertilization rarely produce seed when  punctured if they are not also entered in the normal way. Perforating  is only practiced by a small number of species of insects, and many  but not all of the perforators do so because their tongues are too  short to reach the nectar by entering the flower. Some obtain nectar  from the same kind of flower both in the normal way and by  perforating.    The chief perforators of flowers, in this part of the continent at  least, appear to be some kinds of humble bees (Bombus) and carpenter  bees (Xylocopa). These insects have developed an unerring instinct as  to the proper point to perforate the corollas from the outside, in  order to readily get at the nectar. The holes made by the humble bees  and by the carpenter bees are usually quite different and easily  distinguished.    The humble bees have short, stout, blunt jaws, ill adapted for  cutting, and the perforations made by them are apparently always  irregular in shape, and have jagged edges. It has been stated that the  humble bees often bore through the tubes of their corollas with their  maxillae, but in all cases observed by me the mandibles were first  brought into use in effecting an opening. The noise caused by the  tearing is often audible for a distance of several feet.    The true jaws of the carpenter bees are not any more prominent or  better adapted for making clean-cut perforations than those of the  humble bees; but behind the jaws there is a pair of long,  sharp-pointed, knife-like, jointed organs (maxillae) which seem to be  exclusively used on all ordinary occasions in making perforations. The  inner edges of these maxillae are nearly straight, and when brought  together they form a sharp-pointed, wedge-shaped, plow-like instrument  which makes a clean, narrow, longitudinal slit when it is inserted in  the flower and shoved forward. The slits made by it are often not  readily seen, because the elasticity of the tissues of some flowers  causes them to partially close again. When not in use the instrument  can be folded back, so that it is not conspicuous. The ordinary  observer usually sees no difference between the humble bees and the  carpenter bees, but they may be readily distinguished by a little  close observation.

Corydalis  bulbosa.]    No doubt, in some of the recorded cases of perforations, carpenter  bees have been mistaken for humble bees. The heads of all our Northern  humble bees are rather narrow, retreating from the antennae toward the  sides, and with a more or less dense tuft of hair between the antennae.  The abdomen, as well as the thorax, is always quite densely covered  with hair, which may be black or yellowish or in bands of either  color. With possibly one or two exceptions, the only species I have  seen doing the puncturing is Bombus affinis, Cresson.    The carpenter bees (Xylocopa Virginica) of this region have the head  very broad and square in front, and with no noticeable hair between  the antennae. The heads of the male and female differ strikingly. In  the male the eyes are lighter colored and are hardly half as far apart  as in the female,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15199"],[0,"The Reformed Librarie-Keeper (1650) (#7)"],[1,"opportunities to provoke them to the right use thereof, by giving them  Objects from our store; and furnishing them with tasks and matters to  bee elaborated, which cannot bee diverted from the scope of God's glorie  to bee made known unto all men in Jesus Christ, for there is nothing of  knowledg in the minde of man, which may not bee conveniently referred to  the virtues of God in Christ, whereby the humane nature is to bee  exalted to that dignitie whereunto hee hath received it, that it should  by him rule over the whole Creation.
