And Redruff felt it thrill him through and through. He sprang with  joyous vigor on a stump and sent rolling down the little valley, again  and again, a thundering '_Thump, thump, thump, thunderrrrrrrrr_,' that  wakened dull echoes as it rolled, and voiced his gladness in the coming  of the spring.    Away down the valley was Cuddy's shanty. He heard the drum-call on the  still morning air and 'reckoned there was a cock patridge to git,' and  came sneaking up the ravine with his gun. But Redruff skimmed away in  silence, nor rested till once more in Mud Creek Glen. And there he  mounted the very log where first he had drummed and rolled his loud  tattoo again and again, till a small boy who had taken a short cut to  the mill through the woods, ran home, badly scared, to tell his mother  he was sure the Indians were on the war-path, for he heard their  war-drums beating in the glen.    Why does a happy boy holla? Why does a lonesome youth sigh? They don't  know any more than Redruff knew why every day now he mounted some dead  log and thumped and thundered to the woods; then strutted and admired  his gorgeous blazing ruffs as they flashed their jewels in the sunlight,  and then thundered out again. Whence now came the strange wish for  someone else to admire the plumes? And why had such a notion never come  till the Pussywillow Moon?         _'Thump, thump, thunder-r-r.r-r-r-rrrr'_       _'Thump, thump, thunder-r-r-r-r-r-rrrr'_    he rumbled again and again.    Day after day he sought the favorite log, and a new beauty, a rose-red  comb, grew out above each clear, keen eye, and the clumsy snow-*shoes  were wholly shed from his feet. His ruff grew finer, his eye brighter,  and his whole appearance splendid to behold, as he strutted and flashed  in the sun. But-oh! he was _so lonesome now_.    Yet what could he do but blindly vent his hankering in this daily  drum-parade, till on a day early in loveliest May, when the trilliums  had fringed his log with silver stars, and he had drummed and longed,  then drummed again, his keen ear caught a sound, a gentle footfall in  the brush. He turned to a statue and watched; he knew he had been  watched. Could it be possible? Yes! there it was--a form--another--a shy  little lady grouse, now bashfully seeking to hide. In a moment he was by  her side. His whole nature swamped by a new feeling--burnt up with  thirst--a cooling spring in sight. And how he spread and flashed his  proud array! How came he to know that that would please? He puffed his  plumes and contrived to stand just right to catch the sun, and strutted  and uttered a low, soft chuckle that must have been just as good as the  'sweet nothings' of another race, for clearly now her heart was won.  Won, really, days ago, if only he had known. For full three days she had  come at the loud tattoo and coyly admired him from afar, and felt a  little piqued that he had not yet found her out, so close at hand. So it  was not quite all mischance, perhaps, that that little stamp had caught  his ear. But now she meekly bowed her head with sweet, submissive  grace--the desert passed, the parch-burnt wanderer found the spring at  last.           *       *       *       *       *    Oh, those were bright, glad days in the lovely glen of the unlovely  name. The sun was never so bright, and the piney air was balmier sweet  than dreams. And that great noble bird came daily on his log, sometimes  with her and sometimes quite alone, and drummed for very joy of being  alive. But why sometimes alone? Why not forever with his Brownie bride?  Why should she stay to feast and play with him for hours, then take some  stealthy chance to slip away and see him no more for hours or till next  day, when his martial music from the log announced him restless for her  quick return? There was a woodland mystery here he could not clear. Why  should her stay with him grow daily less till it was down to minutes,  and one day at last she never came at all. Nor the next, nor the next,  and Redruff, wild, careered on lightning wing and drummed on the old  log, then away up-stream on another log, and skimmed the hill to another  ravine to drum and drum. But on the fourth day, when he came and loudly  called her, as of old, at their earliest tryst, he heard a sound in the  bushes, as at first, and there was his missing Brownie bride with ten  little peeping partridges following after.    Redruff skimmed to her side, terribly frightening the bright-eyed  downlings, and was just a little dashed to find the brood with claims  far stronger than his own. But he soon accepted the change, and  thenceforth joined himself to the brood, caring for them as his father  never had for him.          VI      Good fathers are rare in the grouse world. The mother-grouse builds her  nest and hatches out her young without help. She even hides the place of  the nest from the father and meets him only at the drum-log and the  feeding-ground, or perhaps the dusting-place, which is the club-house of  the grouse kind.    When Brownie's little ones came out they had filled her every thought,  even to the forgetting of their splendid father. But on the third day,  when they were strong enough, she had taken them with her at the  father's call.    Some fathers take no interest in their little ones, but Redruff joined  at once to help Brownie in the task of rearing the brood. They had  learned to eat and drink just as their father had learned long ago, and  could toddle along, with their mother leading the way, while the father  ranged near by or followed far behind.    The very next day, as they went from the hill-side down toward the creek  in a somewhat drawn-out string, like beads with a big one at each end, a  red squirrel, peeping around a pine-trunk, watched the processing of  downlings with the Runtie straggling far in the rear. Redruff, yards  behind, preening his feathers on a high log, had escaped the eye of the  squirrel, whose strange, perverted thirst for birdling blood was roused  at what seemed so fair a chance. With murderous intent to cut off the  hindmost straggler, he made a dash. Brownie could not have seen him  until too late, but Redruff did. He flew for that red-haired cutthroat;  his weapons were his fists, that is, the knob-joints of the wings, and  what a blow he could strike! At the first onset he struck the squirrel  square on the end of the nose, his weakest spot, and sent him reeling;  he staggered and wriggled into a brush-pile, where he had expected to  carry the little grouse, and there lay gasping with red drops trickling  down his wicked snout. The partridges left him lying there, and what  became of him they never knew, but he troubled them no more.    The family went on toward the water, but a cow had left deep tracks in  the sandy loam, and into one of these fell one of the chicks and peeped  in dire distress when he found he could not get out.    This was a fix. Neither old one seemed to know what to do, but as they  trampled vainly round the edge, the sandy bank caved in, and, running  down, formed a long slope, up which the young one ran and rejoined his  brothers under the broad veranda of their mother's tail.    Brownie was a bright little mother, of small stature, but keen of wit  and sense, and was, night and day, alert to care for her darling chicks.  How proudly she stepped and clucked through the arching woods with her  dainty brood behind her; how she strained her little brown tail almost  to a half-circle to give them a broader shade, and never flinched at  sight of any foe, but held ready to fight or fly, whichever seemed the  best for her little ones.    [Illustration: Redruff saving Runtie.]    Before the chicks could fly they had a meeting with old Cuddy; though it  was June, he was out with his gun. Up the third ravine he went, and  Tike, his dog, ranging ahead, came so dangerously near the Brownie brood  that Redruff ran to meet him, and by the old but never-failing trick led  him on a foolish chase away back down the valley of the Don.    But Cuddy, as it chanced, came right along, straight for the brood, and  Brownie, giving the signal to the children, '_Krrr, krrr_' (Hide, hide),  ran to lead the man away just as her mate had led the dog. Full of a  mother's devoted love, and skilled in the learning of the woods she ran  in silence till quite near, then sprang with a roar of wings right in  his face, and tumbling on the leaves she shammed a lameness that for a  moment deceived the poacher. But when she dragged one wing and whined  about his feet, then slowly crawled away, he knew just what it  meant--that it was all a trick to lead him from her brood, and he struck  at her a savage blow; but little Brownie was quick, she avoided the blow  and limped behind a sapling, there to beat herself upon the leaves  again in sore distress, and seem so lame that Cuddy made another try to  strike her down with a stick. But she moved in time to balk him, and  bravely, steadfast still to lead him from her helpless little ones, she  flung herself before him and beat her gentle breast upon the ground, and  moaned as though begging for mercy. And Cuddy, failing again to strike  her, raised his gun, and firing charge enough to kill a bear, he blew  poor brave, devoted Brownie into quivering, bloody rags.    This gunner brute knew the young must be hiding near, so looked about to  find them. But no one moved or peeped. He saw not one, but as he tramped  about with heedless, hateful feet, he crossed and crossed again their  hiding-ground, and more than one of the silent little sufferers he  trampled to death, and neither knew nor cared.    Redruff had taken the yellow brute away off down-stream, and now  returned to where he left his mate. The murderer had gone, taking her  remains, to be thrown to the dog. Redruff sought about and found the  bloody spot with feathers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#7)"],[1,"others just  like it.\"    \"Oh, nothing in the world is easier,\" said I.    \"Nothing _can_ be easier,\" said they: so I went on my way.    Now this Sir G. Vans was a giant, and a bottle-maker. And as all giants  who _are_ bottle-makers usually pop out of a little thumb-bottle from  behind the door, so did Sir G. Vans.    \"How d'ye do?\" says he.    \"Very well, I thank you,\" says I.    \"Have some breakfast with me?\"    \"With all my heart,\" says I.    So he gave me a slice of beer, and a cup of cold veal; and there was a  little dog under the table that picked up all the crumbs.    \"Hang him,\" says I.    \"No, don't hang him,\" says he; \"for he killed a hare yesterday. And if  you don't believe me, I'll show you the hare alive in a basket.\"    So he took me into his garden to show me the curiosities. In one corner  there was a fox hatching eagle's eggs; in another there was an iron  apple tree, entirely covered with pears and lead; in the third there was  the hare which the dog killed yesterday alive in the basket; and in the  fourth there were twenty-four _hipper switches_ threshing tobacco, and  at the sight of me they threshed so hard that they drove the plug  through the wall, and through a little dog that was passing by on the  other side. I, hearing the dog howl, jumped over the wall; and turned it  as neatly inside out as possible, when it ran away as if it had not an  hour to live. Then he took me into the park to show me his deer: and I  remembered that I had a warrant in my pocket to shoot venison for his  majesty's dinner. So I set fire to my bow, poised my arrow, and shot  amongst them. I broke seventeen ribs on one side, and twenty-one and a  half on the other; but my arrow passed clean through without ever  touching it, and the worst was I lost my arrow: however, I found it  again in the hollow of a tree. I felt it; it felt clammy. I smelt it; it  smelt honey. \"Oh, ho,\" said I, \"here's a bee's nest,\" when out sprang a  covey of partridges. I shot at them; some say I killed eighteen; but I  am sure I killed thirty-six, besides a dead salmon which was flying over  the bridge, of which I made the best apple-pie I ever tasted.          Tom Hickathrift      Before the days of William the Conqueror there dwelt a man in the marsh  of the Isle of Ely whose name was Thomas Hickathrift, a poor day  labourer, but so stout that he could do two days' work in one. His one  son he called by his own name, Thomas Hickathrift, and he put him to  good learning, but the lad was none of the wisest, and indeed seemed to  be somewhat soft, so he got no good at all from his teaching.    Tom's father died, and his mother being tender of him, kept him as well  as she could. The slothful fellow would do nothing but sit in the  chimney-corner, and eat as much at a time as would serve four or five  ordinary men. And so much did he grow that when but ten years old he was  already eight feet high, and his hand like a shoulder of mutton.    One day his mother went to a rich farmer's house to beg a bottle of  straw for herself and Tom. \"Take what you will,\" said the farmer, an  honest charitable man. So when she got home she told Tom to fetch the  straw, but he wouldn't and, beg as she might, he wouldn't till she  borrowed him a cart rope. So off he went, and when he came to the  farmer's, master and men were all a-trashing in the barn.    \"I'm come for the straw,\" said Tom.    \"Take as much as thou canst carry,\" said the farmer.    So Tom laid down his rope and began to make his bottle.    \"Your rope is too short,\" said the farmer by way of a joke; but the joke  was on Tom's side, for when he had made up his load there was some  twenty hundred-weight of straw, and though they called him a fool for  thinking he could carry the tithe of it, he flung it over his shoulder  as if it had been a hundred-weight, to the great admiration of master  and men.    Tom's strength being thus made known there was no longer any basking by  the fire for him; every one would be hiring him to work, and telling  him 't was a shame to live such a lazy life. So Tom seeing them wait on  him as they did, went to work first with one, then with another. And one  day a woodman desired his help to bring home a tree. Off went Tom and  four men besides, and when they came to the tree they began to draw it  into the cart with pulleys. At last Tom, seeing them unable to lift it,  \"Stand away, you fools,\" said he, and taking the tree, set it on one end  and laid it in the cart. \"Now,\" said he, \"see what a man can do.\"  \"Marry, 't is true,\" said they, and the woodman asked what reward he'd  take. \"Oh, a stick for my mother's fire,\" said Tom; and espying a tree  bigger than was in the cart, he laid it on his shoulders and went home  with it as fast as the cart and six horses could draw it.    Tom now saw that he had more strength than twenty men, and began to be  very merry, taking delight in company, in going to fairs and meetings,  in seeing sports and pastimes. And at cudgels, wrestling, or throwing  the hammer, not a man could stand against him, so that at last none  durst go into the ring to wrestle with him, and his fame was spread more  and more in the country.    Far and near he would go to any meetings, as football play or the like.  And one day in a part of the country where he was a stranger, and none  knew him, he stopped to watch the company at football play; rare sport  it was; but Tom spoiled it all, for meeting the ball he took it such a  kick that away it flew none could tell whither. They were angry with Tom  as you may fancy, but got nothing by that as Tom took hold of a big  spar, and laid about with a will, so that though the whole country-side  was up in arms against him, he cleared his way wherever he came.    It was late in the evening ere he could turn homeward, and on the road  there met him four lusty rogues that had been robbing passengers all  day. They thought they had a good prize in Tom, who was all alone, and  made cocksure of his money.    \"Stand and deliver!\" said they.    \"What should I deliver?\" said Tom.    \"Your money, sirrah,\" said they.    \"You shall give me better words for it first,\" said Tom.    \"Come, come, no more prating; money we want, and money we'll have before  you stir.\"    \"Is it so?\" said Tom, \"nay, then come and take it.\"    The long and the short of it was that Tom killed two of the rogues and  grieviously wounded the other two, and took all their money, which was  as much as two hundred pounds. And when he came home he made his old  mother laugh with the story of how he served the football players and  the four thieves.    But you shall see that Tom sometimes met his match. In wandering one day  in the forest he met a lusty tinker that had a good staff on his  shoulder, and a great dog to carry his bag and tools.    \"Whence come you and whither are you going?\" said Tom, \"this is no  highway.\"    \"What's that to you?\" said the tinker; \"fools must needs be meddling.\"    \"I'll make you know,\" said Tom, \"before you and I part, what it is to  me.\"    \"Well,\" said the tinker, \"I'm ready for a bout with any man, and I hear  there is one Tom Hickathrift in the country of whom great things are  told. I'd fain see him to have a turn with him.\"    \"Ay,\" said Tom, \"methinks he might be master with you. Anyhow, I am the  man; what have you to say to me?\"    \"Why, verily, I'm glad we are so happily met.\"    \"Sure, you do but jest,\" said Tom.    \"Marry, I'm in earnest,\" said the tinker. \"A match?\" \"'T is done.\" \"Let  me first get a twig,\" said Tom. \"Ay,\" said the tinker, \"hang him that  would fight a man unarmed.\"    So Tom took a gate-rail for his staff, and at it they fell, the tinker  at Tom, and Tom at the tinker, like two giants they laid on at each  other. The tinker had a leathern coat on, and at every blow Tom gave the  tinker his coat roared again, yet the tinker did not give way one inch.  At last Tom gave him a blow on the side of his head which felled him.    \"Now tinker where are you?\" said Tom.    But the tinker being a nimble fellow, leapt up again, gave Tom a blow  that made him reel again, and followed his blow with one on the other  side that made Tom's neck crack again. So Tom flung down his weapon and  yielded the tinker the better on it, took him home to his house, where  they nursed their bruises and from that day forth there was no  stauncher pair of friends than they two.    Tom's fame was thus spread abroad till at length a brewer at Lynn,  wanting a good lusty man to carry his beer to Wisbeach went to hire Tom,  and promised him a new suit of clothes from top to toe, and that he  should eat and drink of the best, so Tom yielded to be his man and his  master told him what way he should go, for you must understand there was  a monstrous giant who kept part of the marsh-land, so that none durst go  that way.    So Tom went every day to Wisbeach a good twenty miles by the road. 'T  was a wearisome journey thought Tom and he soon found that the way kept  by the giant was nearer by half. Now Tom had got more strength than  ever, being well kept as he was and drinking so much strong ale as he  did. One day, then, as he was going to Wisbeach, without saying anything  to his master or any of his fellow servants, he resolved to take the  nearest road or to lose his life; as they say, to win horse or lose  saddle. Thus resolved, he took the near road, flinging open the gates  for his cart and horses to go through. At last the giant spied him, and  came up speedily, intending to take his beer for a prize.    He met Tom like a lion as though he would have swallowed him. \"Who gave  you authority to come this way?\" roared he. \"I'll make you an example  for all rogues under the sun. See how many heads hang on yonder tree.  Yours shall hang higher than all the rest for a warning.\"    But Tom made him answer, \"A fig in your teeth you shall not find me like  one of them, traitorly rogue that you are.\"    The giant"]]]
