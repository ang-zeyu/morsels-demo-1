Sadly, but with a great love, he had gone about the  country on his self-imposed task. To do this work he had given up the  business of a saddler, in which he had prospered, had sacrificed his  possessions, and renounced the ease that comes with wealth; had courted  unheard-of hardships, and wedded himself for better and worse to poverty  and unremitting endeavor. Nothing did he esteem too dear to relinquish  for the slave. Neither wife nor children did he withhold. Neither the  summer's heat nor the winter's cold was able to daunt him or turn him  from his object. Though diminutive and delicate of body, no distance or  difficulty of travel was ever able to deter him from doing what his  humanity had bidden him do. From place to place, through nineteen  States, he had traveled, sowing as he went the seeds of his holy  purpose, and watering them with his life's blood. Not Livingstone nor  Stanley on the dark continent exceeded in sheer physical exertion and  endurance the labors of this wonderful man. He belongs in the category  of great explorers, only the irresistible passion and purpose, which  pushed him forward, had humanity, not geography, as their goal. Where,  in the lives of either Stanley or Livingstone do we find a record of  more astonishing activity and achievement than what is contained in  these sentences, written by Garrison of Lundy, in the winter of 1828?  \"Within a few months he has traveled about twenty-four hundred miles, of  which upwards of nineteen hundred were performed _on foot!_ during which  time he has held nearly fifty public meetings. Rivers and mountains  vanish in his path; midnight finds him wending his solitary way over an  unfrequented road; the sun is anticipated in his rising. Never was moral  sublimity of character better illustrated.\" Such was the marvelous man,  whose visit to Boston, in the month of March, of the year 1828, dates  the beginning of a new epoch in the history of America. The event of  that year was not the \"Bill of Abominations,\" great as was the national  excitement which it produced; nor was it yet the then impending  political struggle between Jackson and Adams, but the unnoticed meeting  of Lundy and Garrison. Great historic movements are born not in the  whirlwinds, the earthquakes, and the pomps of human splendor and power,  but in the agonies and enthusiasms of grand, heroic spirits. Up to this  time Garrison had had, as the religious revivalist would say, no  \"realizing sense\" of the enormity of slave-holding. Occasionally an  utterance had dropped from his pen which indicated that his heart was  right on the subject, but which evinced no more than the ordinary  opposition to its existence, nor any profound convictions as to his own  or the nation's duty in regard to its extinction. His first reference to  the question appeared in connection with a notice made by him in the  _Free Press_ of a spirited poem, entitled \"Africa,\" in which the  authoress sings of:      \"The wild and mingling groans of writhing millions,    Calling for vengeance on my guilty land.\"      He commended the verses \"to all those who wish to cherish female genius,  and whose best feelings are enlisted in the cause of the poor oppressed  sons of Africa.\" He was evidently impressed, but the impression belonged  to the ordinary, transitory sort. His next recorded utterance on the  subject was also in the _Free Press_. It was made in relation with some  just and admirable strictures on the regulation Fourth of July oration,  with its \"ceaseless apostrophes to liberty, and fierce denunciations of  tyranny.\" Such a tone was false and mischievous--the occasion was for  other and graver matter. \"There is one theme,\" he declares, \"which  should be dwelt upon, till our whole country is free from the curse--it  is slavery.\" The emphasis and energy of the rebuke and exhortation lifts  this second allusion to slavery, quite outside of merely ordinary  occurrences. It was not an ordinary personal occurrence for it served to  reveal in its lightning-like flash the glow and glare of a conscience  taking fire. The fire slumbered until a few weeks before Lundy entered  Boston, when there were again the glow and glare of a moral sense in the  first stages of ignition on the enormity of slave institutions. The act  of South Carolina in making it illegal to teach a colored person to read  and write struck this spark from his pen: \"There is something  unspeakably pitiable and alarming,\" he writes in the _Philanthropist_,  \"in the state of that society where it is deemed necessary, for  self-preservation, to seal up the mind and debase the intellect of man  to brutal incapacity.... Truly the alternatives of oppression are  terrible. But this state of things cannot always last, nor ignorance  alone shield us from destruction.\" His interest in the question was  clearly growing. But it was still in the gristle of sentiment waiting to  be transmuted into the bone and muscle of a definite and determined  purpose, when first he met Lundy. This meeting of the two men, was to  Garrison what the fourth call of God was to Samuel, the Hebrew lad, who  afterward became a prophet. As the three previous calls of God and the  conversations with Eli had prepared the Jewish boy to receive and  understand the next summons of Jehovah, so had Garrison's former  experience and education made him ready for the divine message when  uttered in his ears by Lundy. All the sense of truth and the passion for  righteousness of the young man replied to the voice, \"Here am I.\" The  hardening process of growth became immediately manifest in him. Whereas  before there was sentimental opposition to slavery, there began then an  opposition, active and practical. When Lundy convened many of the  ministers of the city to expose to them the barbarism of slavery,  Garrison sat in the room, and as Lundy himself records, \"expressed his  approbation of my doctrines.\" The young reformer must needs stand up and  make public profession of his new faith and of his agreement with the  anti-slavery principles of the older. But it was altogether different  with the assembled ministers. Lundy, as was his wont on such occasions,  desired and urged the formation of an anti-slavery society, but these  sons of Eli of that generation were not willing to offend their  slave-holding brethren in the South. Eyes they had, but they refused to  see; ears, which they stopped to the cry of the slave breaking in  anguish and appeal from the lips of this modern man of God. Garrison,  eleven years later, after the lips, which were eloquent then with their  great sorrow, were speechless in the grave, told the story of that  ministers' meeting. And here is the story:    \"He (Lundy) might as well have urged the stones in the streets to cry  out in behalf of the perishing captives. Oh, the moral cowardice, the  chilling apathy, the criminal unbelief, the cruel skepticism, that were  revealed on that memorable occasion! My soul was on fire then, as it is  now, in view of such a development. Every soul in the room was heartily  opposed to slavery, but, it would terribly alarm and enrage the South to  know that an anti-slavery society existed in Boston. But it would do  harm rather than good openly to agitate the subject. But _perhaps a  select_ committee might be formed, to be called by some name that would  neither give offence, nor excite suspicion as to its real design! One or  two only were for bold and decisive action; but as they had neither  station nor influence, and did not rank among the wise and prudent,  their opinion did not weigh very heavily, and the project was finally  abandoned. Poor Lundy! that meeting was a damper to his feelings.\" There  is no doubt that Garrison was one of the very few present, who \"were for  bold and decisive action\" against the iniquity. The grief and  disappointment of his brave friend touched his heart with a brother's  affection and pity. The worldly wisdom and lukewarmness of the clergy  kindled a righteous indignation within his freedom-loving soul. This was  his first bitter lesson from the clergy. There were, alas, many and  bitterer experiences to follow, but of them he little recked at the  time. As this nineteenth-century prophet mused upon the horrible thing  the fires of a life purpose burned within him. And oftener thenceforth  we catch glimpses of the glow and glare of a soul bursting into flame.  The editorials in the _Philanthropist_, which swiftly followed Lundy's  visit, began to throw off more heat as the revolving wheels of an  electrical machine throw off sparks. The evil that there was in the  world, under which, wherever he turned, he saw his brother man  staggering and bleeding, was no longer what it had been, a vague and  shadowy apparition, but rather a terrible and tremendous reality against  which he must go forth to fight the fight of a lifetime. And so he  girded him with his life purpose and flung his moral earnestness against  the triple-headed curse of intemperance, slavery, and war. A mighty  human love had begun to flow inward and over him. And as the tide  steadily rose it swallowed and drowned all the egoism of self and race  in the altruism of an all-embracing humanity. When an apprentice in the  office of the Newburyport _Herald_, and writing on the subject of South  American affairs he grew hot over the wrongs suffered by American  vessels at Valparaiso and Lima. He was for finishing \"with cannon what  cannot be done in a conciliatory and equitable manner, where justice  demands such proceedings.\" This was at seventeen when he was a boy with  the thoughts of a boy.

Yet this  heath was very extensive and very barren, and, as Mr. Darwin remarks, no  one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and so  effectually searched it for food.    In the case of animals, the competition and struggle are more obvious.  The vegetation of a given district can only support a certain number of  animals, and the different kinds of plant-eaters will compete together  for it. They will also have insects for their competitors, and these  insects will be kept down by birds, which will thus assist the mammalia.  But there will also be carnivora destroying the herbivora; while small  rodents, like the lemming and some of the field-mice, often destroy so  much vegetation as materially to affect the food of all the other groups  of animals. Droughts, floods, severe winters, storms and hurricanes will  injure these in various degrees, but no one species can be diminished in  numbers without the effect being felt in various complex ways by all the  rest. A few illustrations of this reciprocal action must be given.      _Illustrative Cases of the Struggle for Life_.    Sir Charles Lyell observes that if, by the attacks of seals or other  marine foes, salmon are reduced in numbers, the consequence will be that  otters, living far inland, will be deprived of food and will then  destroy many young birds or quadrupeds, so that the increase of a marine  animal may cause the destruction of many land animals hundreds of miles  away. Mr. Darwin carefully observed the effects produced by planting a  few hundred acres of Scotch fir, in Staffordshire, on part of a very  extensive heath which had never been cultivated. After the planted  portion was about twenty-five years old he observed that the change in  the native vegetation was greater than is often seen in passing from  one quite different soil to another. Besides a great change in the  proportional numbers of the native heath-plants, twelve species which  could not be found on the heath flourished in the plantations. The  effect on the insect life must have been still greater, for six  insectivorous birds which were very common in the plantations were not  to be seen on the heath, which was, however, frequented by two or three  different species of insectivorous birds. It would have required  continued study for several years to determine all the differences in  the organic life of the two areas, but the facts stated by Mr. Darwin  are sufficient to show how great a change may be effected by the  introduction of a single kind of tree and the keeping out of cattle.    The next case I will give in Mr. Darwin's own words: \"In several parts  of the world insects determine the existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay  offers the most curious instance of this; for here neither cattle nor  horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and  northward in a feral state; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this  is caused by the greater numbers, in Paraguay, of a certain fly which  lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. The  increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually  checked by some means, probably by other parasitic insects. Hence, if  certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic  insects would probably increase; and this would lessen the number of the  navel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses would become feral, and  this would greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South  America) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects,  and this, as we have just seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous  birds, and so onward in ever-increasing circles of complexity. Not that  under nature the relations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within  battle must be continually recurring with varying success; and yet in  the long run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature  remains for a long time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle  would give the victory to one organic being over another.\"[7]    Such cases as the above may perhaps be thought exceptional, but there  is good reason to believe that they are by no means rare, but are  illustrations of what is going on in every part of the world, only it is  very difficult for us to trace out the complex reactions that are  everywhere occurring. The general impression of the ordinary observer  seems to be that wild animals and plants live peaceful lives and have  few troubles, each being exactly suited to its place and surroundings,  and therefore having no difficulty in maintaining itself. Before showing  that this view is, everywhere and always, demonstrably untrue, we will  consider one other case of the complex relations of distinct organisms  adduced by Mr. Darwin, and often quoted for its striking and almost  eccentric character. It is now well known that many flowers require to  be fertilised by insects in order to produce seed, and this  fertilisation can, in some cases, only be effected by one particular  species of insect to which the flower has become specially adapted. Two  of our common plants, the wild heart's-ease (Viola tricolor) and the red  clover (Trifolium pratense), are thus fertilised by humble-bees almost  exclusively, and if these insects are prevented from visiting the  flowers, they produce either no seed at all or exceedingly few. Now it  is known that field-mice destroy the combs and nests of humble-bees, and  Colonel Newman, who has paid great attention to these insects, believes  that more than two-thirds of all the humble-bees' nests in England are  thus destroyed. But the number of mice depends a good deal on the number  of cats; and the same observer says that near villages and towns he has  found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which he  attributes to the number of cats that destroy the mice. Hence it  follows, that the abundance of red clover and wild heart's-ease in a  district will depend on a good supply of cats to kill the mice, which  would otherwise destroy and keep down the humble-bees and prevent them  from fertilising the flowers. A chain of connection has thus been found  between such totally distinct organisms as flesh-eating mammalia and  sweet-smelling flowers, the abundance or scarcity of the one closely  corresponding to that of the other!    The following account of the struggle between trees in the forests of  Denmark, from the researches of M. Hansten-Blangsted, strikingly  illustrates our subject.[8] The chief combatants are the beech and the  birch, the former being everywhere successful in its invasions. Forests  composed wholly of birch are now only found in sterile, sandy tracts;  everywhere else the trees are mixed, and wherever the soil is favourable  the beech rapidly drives out the birch. The latter loses its branches at  the touch of the beech, and devotes all its strength to the upper part  where it towers above the beech. It may live long in this way, but it  succumbs ultimately in the fight--of old age if of nothing else, for the  life of the birch in Denmark is shorter than that of the beech. The  writer believes that light (or rather shade) is the cause of the  superiority of the latter, for it has a greater development of its  branches than the birch, which is more open and thus allows the rays of  the sun to pass through to the soil below, while the tufted, bushy top  of the beech preserves a deep shade at its base. Hardly any young plants  can grow under the beech except its own shoots; and while the beech can  nourish under the shade of the birch, the latter dies immediately under  the beech. The birch has only been saved from total extermination by the  facts that it had possession of the Danish forests long before the beech  ever reached the country, and that certain districts are unfavourable to  the growth of the latter. But wherever the soil has been enriched by the  decomposition of the leaves of the birch the battle begins. The birch  still flourishes on the borders of lakes and other marshy places, where  its enemy cannot exist. In the same way, in the forests of Zeeland, the  fir forests are disappearing before the beech. Left to themselves, the  firs are soon displaced by the beech. The struggle between the latter  and the oak is longer and more stubborn, for the branches and foliage of  the oak are thicker, and offer much resistance to the passage of light.  The oak, also, has greater longevity; but, sooner or later, it too  succumbs, because it cannot develop in the shadow of the beech. The  earliest forests of Denmark were mainly composed of aspens, with which  the birch was apparently associated; gradually the soil was raised, and  the climate grew milder; then the fir came and formed large forests.  This tree ruled for centuries, and then ceded the first place to the  holm-oak, which is now giving way to the beech. Aspen, birch, fir, oak,  and beech appear to be the steps in the struggle for the survival of the  fittest among the forest-trees of Denmark.    It may be added that in the time of the Romans the beech was the  principal forest-tree of Denmark as it is now, while in the much earlier  bronze age, represented by the later remains found in the peat bogs,  there were no beech-trees, or very few, the oak being the prevailing  tree, while in the still earlier stone period the fir was the most  abundant. The beech is a tree essentially of the temperate zone, having  its northern limit considerably southward of the oak, fir, birch, or  aspen, and its entrance into Denmark was no doubt due to the  amelioration of the climate after the glacial epoch had entirely passed  away. We thus see how changes of climate, which are continually  occurring owing either to cosmical or geographical causes, may initiate  a struggle among plants which may continue"]]]
