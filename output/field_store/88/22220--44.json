Lawton, although he knew it not, was elected from that  moment.    The ritual of the club, while stern toward initiates, is not brutal.  Since you are bursar for the lunch, said the secretary, I will buy  the ferry tickets, and he did so. On the boat these carefree men  gazed blithely upon the shipping. \"Little did I think,\" said Lawton,  \"that I was going for a sea voyage.\" \"That,\" said the club, \"is the  kind of fellows we are. Whimsical. As soon as we think of a thing,  we don't do it.\"    \"Is that the _Leviathan_ up there?\" said one of the members,  pointing toward a gray hull on the Hoboken horizon. No one knew, but  the secretary was reminded of an adventure during the war. \"One time  I was crossing on this ferry,\" he said, \"and the _Leviathan_ passed  right by us. It was just at dusk and her camouflage was wonderful.  Her blotches and stripes were so arranged that from a little  distance, in the twilight, she gave the impression of a much smaller  vessel, going the other way. All her upper works seemed to fade out  in the haze and she became a much smaller ship.\" \"That would be a  wonderful plan for some of these copious dowagers one sees,\" said  the irreverent Lawton. \"Yes,\" we said; \"instead of a stout lady  going in to dinner, you would see a slim flapper coming out.\"    Something was then said about a good friend of the club who had at  one time worked for the Y.M.C.A. \"What is he doing now?\" asked one.  \"He's with Grace and Company,\" said the secretary. The candidate was  unabashed. \"Think,\" he said, \"of a Y.M.C.A. man getting grace at  last.\"    The club found the Jersey City terminal much as usual, and to our  surprise the candidate kept up his courage nobly as he was steered  toward the place of penance, being the station lunch counter. The  club remembered this as a place of excellent food in days gone by,  when trains from Philadelphia stopped here instead of at the Penn.  Station. Placing the host carefully in the middle, the three sat  down at the curving marble slab. The waiters immediately sensed that  something unusual was toward. Two dashed up with courteous  attentions. It was surmised by the club that the trio had happened  to sit at a spot where the jurisdictions of two waiters met. Both  the wings of the trio waved the waiters toward the blushing novice,  making it plain that upon him lay all responsibility. \"It is  obvious,\" remarked the secretary, \"that you, Lawton, are right on  the boundary line where two waiters meet. You will have to tip them  both.\"    The new member was game. \"Well,\" he said, without a trace of  nervousness; \"what'll you have?\" The choice fell upon breast of  lamb. The secretary asked for iced tea. Endymion, more ruthless,  ordered ginger ale. When the ginger ale came, Lawton, still waggish,  observed the label, which was one of the many imitations of a  well-known brand. \"The man who invented the diamond-shaped label,\"  said Lawton, \"was certainly a pathfinder in the wilderness of the  ginger ale business. This ginger ale,\" said Lawton, tasting it, \"is  carefully warmed, like old claret.\"    The club sought to keep their host's mind off the painful topic of  viands. \"Sitting here makes one feel as though he ought to be going  to take a train somewhere,\" said one. \"Yes, the express for  Weehawken,\" said the vivacious host. From this it was only a step to  speaking of Brooklyn. The secretary explained that the club had  outlined a careful itinerary in that borough for proximate pursuit.  Lawton told that he had at one time written an essay on the effect  of Brooklyn on the dialogue of the American drama. \"It is the butt  end of Long Island,\" he cried, with cruel mirth. Lovers of Brooklyn  in the club nearly blackballed him for this.    With ice cream and cottage pudding, the admirable menu proceeded.  The waiters conferred secretly together. They carefully noted the  cheerful carving of the host's brow. They will know him again. A man  who bursts in suddenly upon a railroad lunch counter and pays for  three such meals, here is an event in the grim routine! But perhaps  the two charter members were feeling pangs of conscience. \"Come,\"  they said, \"at least let us split the ginger ale checks.\" But  Lawton was seeing it through. Not a drum was heard, not a funeral  note, as our host to the cashier we hurried. The secretary bought a  penny box of matches and lit the great man's cigarette for him.  Endymion, equally stirred, ran to buy the ferry tickets for the  return voyage. \"This time,\" he said, \"I will be the ferry  godmother.\"    On the homeward passage a little drowse fell upon the two charter  members. They had lunched more richly than was their wont. \"Oh,  these distressing, heavy lunches!\" as Aldous Huxley cries in one of  his poems. But Lawton was still of bright vivacity. At that time the  club was perturbed by the coming Harding-Cox election. \"Which of the  vice-presidents are you going to vote for?\" he cried, and then said:  \"It looks to me like Debs or dubs.\"    Endymion and the secretary looked at each other solemnly. The time  had come. \"I, Endymion,\" said the chairman, \"take thee, Lawton, to  have and to hold, as a member of the club.\"    And the secretary tenderly pronounced the society's formula for such  occasions: \"There is no inanition in an initiation.\"            [Illustration]        CREED OF THE THREE HOURS FOR LUNCH CLUB      It has been suggested that the Three Hours for Lunch Club is an  immoral institution; that it is founded upon an insufficient respect  for the devotions of industry; that it runs counter to the form and  pressure of the age; that it encourages a greedy and rambling humour  in the young of both sexes; that it even punctures, in the bosoms of  settled merchants and rotarians, that capsule of efficiency and  determination by which Great Matters are Put Over. It has been said,  in short, that the Three Hours for Lunch Club should be more  clandestine and reticent about its truancies.    Accordingly, it seems good to us to testify concerning Lunches and  the philosophy of Lunching.    There are Lunches of many kinds. The Club has been privileged to  attend gatherings of considerable lustre; occasions when dishes of  richness and curiosity were dissected; when the surroundings were  not devoid of glamour and surreptitious pomp. The Club has been  convened in many different places: in resorts of pride and in  low-ceiled reeky taphouses; in hotels where those clear cubes of  unprofitable ice knock tinklingly in the goblets; in the brightly  tinted cellars of Greenwich Village; in the saloons of ships. But  the Club would give a false impression of its mind and heart if it  allowed any one to suppose that Food is the chief object of its  quest. It is true that Man, bitterly examined, is merely a vehicle  for units of nourishing combustion; but on those occasions when the  Club feels most truly Itself it rises above such considerations.    The form and pressure of the time (to repeat Hamlet's phrase) is  such that thoughtful men--and of such the Club is exclusively  composed: men of great heart, men of nice susceptibility--are  continually oppressed by the fumbling, hasty, and insignificant  manner in which human contacts are accomplished. Let us even say,  _masculine_ contacts: for the first task of any philosopher being to  simplify his problem so that he can examine it clearly and with less  distraction, the Club makes a great and drastic purge by sweeping  away altogether the enigmatic and frivolous sex and disregarding it,  at any rate during the hours of convivial session. The Club is  troubled to note that in the intolerable rabies and confusion of  this business life men meet merely in a kind of convulsion or horrid  passion of haste and perplexity. We see, ever and often, those in  whose faces we discern delightful and considerable secrets, messages  of just import, grotesque mirth, or improving sadness. In their  bearing and gesture, even in hours of haste and irritation, the Club  (with its trained and observant eye) notes the secret and rare sign  of Thought. Such men are marked by an inexorable follow-up system.  Sooner or later their telephones ring; secretaries and go-betweens  are brushed aside; they are bidden to appear at such and such a time  and place; no excuses are accepted. Then follow the Consolations of  Intercourse. Conducted with \"shattering candour\" (as one has said  who is in spirit a member of this Club, though not yet, alas,  inducted), the meetings may sometimes resolve themselves into a  ribaldry, sometimes into a truthful pursuit of Beauty, sometimes  into a mere logomachy. But in these symposiums, unmarred by the  crude claim of duty, the Club does with single-minded resolve pursue  the only lasting satisfaction allowed to humanity, to wit, the  sympathetic study of other men's minds.    This is clumsily said: but we have seen moments when eager and  honourable faces round the board explained to us what we mean. There  is but one indefeasible duty of man, to say out the truth that is in  his heart. The way of life engendered by a great city and a modern  civilization makes it hard to do so. It is the function of the Club  to say to the City and to Life Itself: \"Stand back! Fair play! We  see a goodly matter inditing in our friend's spirit. We will take  our ease and find out what it is.\"    For this life of ours (asserts the Club) is curiously compounded of  Beauty and Dross. You ascend the Woolworth Building, let us say--one  of man's noblest and most poetic achievements. And at the top, what  do you find, just before going out upon that gallery to spread your  eye upon man's reticulated concerns? Do you find a little temple or  cloister for meditation, or any way of marking in your mind the  beauty and significance of the place? No, a man in uniform will  thrust into your hand a booklet of well-intentioned description (but  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],[0,"The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#7)"],[1,"well.\"    \"Humph!\" Lew Flapp stared at the eldest Rover harder than ever.  \"Perhaps you think you can do it,\" he sneered.    \"I didn't say that.\"    \"But your words implied it.\"    \"Dick Rover can do every bit as well,\" said a cadet who overheard the  talk.    \"I want to see him do it.\"    \"I didn't come here to punch the bag,\" said Dick as calmly as ever. \"I  just thought I'd take a look around.\"    \"Humph! Afraid to try, eh?\"    \"Oh, no.\"    \"I dare you to show what you can do,\" sneered Lew Flapp.    \"Very well, I'll show you,\" came from Dick, and he began to take off  his coat, collar, and tie.          CHAPTER VIII    A SCENE IN THE GYMNASIUM      Lew Flapp spoke in such a loud, overbearing voice that a crowd began to  collect in the corner where the punching apparatus was located.    \"What's up?\" asked more than one cadet.    \"Lew Flapp and Dick Rover are going to try to beat each other at  punching the bag,\" was the report.    \"Rover will have to do his best then. Flapp is a prime one at bag  punching. It's about the only thing he can do real well.\"    \"This isn't a fair contest,\" put in another student. \"Flapp took  lessons from a man who used to do bag-punching on the vaudeville  stage.\"    \"If that's so I wouldn't try to beat him, if I was Dick Rover.\"    Dick heard some of this talk but said nothing. He was soon ready for  the trial, and stepping up to the punching bag he began to undo the top  strap.    \"That bag is all right,\" blustered Lew Flapp.    \"Yes--for you,\" answered Dick. \"But you must remember, I am not quite  so tall. I must have it an inch lower.\"    \"It seems to me you are mighty particular.\"    \"I have a right to be. When you do your punching you can raise the bag  as high as you please.\"    \"That's the talk,\" came from several standing near.    By this time Larry was on the floor again, and he came up to learn what  Dick was doing.    \"Dick, they tell me he is the best bag-puncher here,\" whispered Larry.    \"I can't help it.\"    \"He will crow over you if you don't do as well as he can do.\"    \"Let him.\"    Dick began his punching exercise slowly, for he had not tried it for  some time, and was afraid he was a little stiff. But, it may be added  here, there was a punching bag in the barn at the Rovers' farm, so the  youth knew exactly what he was doing.    \"Oh, anybody can do that,\" remarked Lew Flapp presently. \"That's as  simple as A. B. C.\"    \"Well, can you do this?\" returned Dick, and branched off into something  a trifle more difficult.    \"To be sure I can.\"    \"Then what about this?\" and now Dick settled down to some real work.  Clap! clap! went the bag, this way and that.    \"Yes, I can do that, too,\" answered the tall boy.    \"I'd like to see you.\"    Lew Flapp was only too anxious to show his skill, and having adjusted  the bag to suit him, he went at the work once again, doing just what  Dick had done.    \"Now do this!\" he cried, and gave a performance of his most difficult  exercise. It was certainly well executed and at the conclusion many of  the cadets began to applaud.    \"Dick Rover will have to hump himself to do that,\" remarked one.    \"I don't believe he can touch it,\" said another.    With care Dick fixed the bag and went at the exercise. It was something  he had not practiced for a considerable time, yet he did not miss a  stroke, and he wound up with a speed fully equal to that exhibited by  his opponent.    \"Good for you, Dick!\" cried Larry heartily.    \"They'll have to call it a tie,\" suggested another cadet.    \"I'm not done yet,\" said Dick. \"Can you do this?\" he asked of Lew  Flapp, and then commenced an exercise he had learned some time before,  from a boxing instructor. It was full of intricate movements, all  executed so rapidly that the eye could scarcely follow them. The cadets  looked on in wonder, Lew Flapp staring angrily at the performance.    \"Wonderful!\"    \"I didn't know Dick Rover could do such punching!\"    \"Say, Flapp, you'll have to get up early in the morning to beat that.\"    \"Oh, you shut your mouth!\" retorted Lew Flapp angrily. \"I can do ten  times better, if I want to.\"    \"Let us see you.\"    \"I--I--I'm in no condition to go ahead just now. Remember, I was  punching the bag for an hour before Rover got here.\"    \"How can that be, when all of us just came from the mess hall?\"  questioned Larry.    \"He's trying to sneak out of the trial,\" said a voice in the rear of  the crowd.    \"I'll sneak you!\" roared Lew Flap, in a rage. \"I want you all to know  that I ain't afraid of Dick Rover, or anybody else.\"    \"Do you want the trial to continue?\"  questioned Dick, in an even tone.    \"Didn't I just say I was tired out? But I'll show you what I can do  some time,\" blustered Lew Flapp.    \"Oh; all right.\"    \"You needn't think you're king-pin of the punching bag,\" went on the  tall boy, who had lost control of his temper because of the exhibition.    \"Thank you, Flapp, what I think and what I don't think isn't any of  your business.\"    \"Pooh! I've heard about you and your two brothers, Dick Rover. They  tell all sorts of stories about you, but I don't believe the half of  them.\"    \"Come, come, what's the use of quarreling,\" put in Larry pleasantly.    \"I'm sure I don't want to quarrel,\" answered Dick. \"He challenged me to  punch the bag against him, and I did so, that's all.\"    \"You're dead stuck on yourself, Rover,\" went on Lew Flapp slangily.  \"You think you're the only toad in the puddle. But you ain't, let me  tell you that. As soon as I heard about you, I made up my mind I  wouldn't knuckle under to you.\"    \"This isn't right!\" cried Larry. \"Dick is my friend, and let me say he  never asks any cadet to knuckle under to him, unless the cadet did  something that wasn't on the level.\"    \"That's true! That's true!\" came from half a dozen of the students.  \"Dick Rover is all right!\"    \"So you're all turning against me, eh?\" burst out Lew Flapp fiercely,  his face growing dark with rage. \"I was warned of this before I came  here.\"    \"Who warned you?\" asked Tom, who had just put in an appearance.    \"A gentleman who used to teach here.\"    \"What was his name?\" questioned several.    \"Mr. Jasper Grinder. He said he had left because the Rover boys tried  to run everything.\"    \"That old fraud!\" cried Larry.    \"He left because he was kicked out,\" came from another.    \"And he is a criminal,\" put in Dick. \"I can prove it, if he wants me to  do it.\"    \"Oh, you can talk all you please,\" growled Lew Flapp. \"I know what I  know, and don't you forget it. And what is more, Dick Rover, don't you  expect me to knuckle under to you. If you try that game, you'll get  what you least expect,\" and so speaking Lew Flapp forced his way out of  the crowd and left the gymnasium.    \"Well, of all the idiots I ever met!\" came from Tom. \"He believes in  meeting trouble three-quarters of the way, doesn't he?\"    \"I think Jasper Grinder must have stuffed him full of stories about  us,\" said Dick. \"That's the way that rascally teacher expects to get  square on Captain Putnam--by ruining the reputation of the school.\"    \"Oh, it's mostly Lew Flapp's fault,\" put in a pupil who had been at the  Hall for some time. \"The very first day Flapp arrived he had a row with  little Tommy Browne, and knocked Tommy down, and a few days after that  he had a fight with Jack Raymond, and was pounding Jack good when Mr.  Strong came up and made them run off in different directions. He's a  good deal of the same kind of a bully that Dan Baxter was.\"    \"If that's the case, he had better keep his distance,\" said Dick  determinedly. \"I don't want any quarrels, but I despise a bully  thoroughly.\"    \"So do I.\"    \"I wonder if this Flipflap ever heard of Dan Baxter,\" put in Tom. \"If  he has he ought to profit by the example.\"    \"Hullo, Tom's got a new name for Flapp,\" said one of the boys.    \"Isn't his name Flipflap?\" questioned Tom innocently. \"Or is it  Flapjack?\"    \"It will be Flopdown, if he ever gets into a fight with Dick,\" said  Larry, and then followed a general laugh.    \"I really don't want any more fights,\" said Dick, when he could be  heard. \"I came back to Putnam Hall to dig in and learn something. I've  had enough adventures to last a lifetime. If the others will only leave  me alone I'll leave them alone.\"    \"But if they won't leave you alone, Dick?\" asked George Granbury.    \"Then they had better look out for themselves, that's all,\" was the  reply of the eldest Rover.          CHAPTER IX    SETTLING DOWN TO STUDY      Dick meant what he said concerning coming back to Putnam Hall for the  sake of learning something. He felt that he had lost too much time from  school already to lose more, and he pitched in with a vigor that was  indeed surprising.    \"I don't see how you can do it,\" said Tom one day. \"I can't, to save my  life.\" Yet Tom was by no means a poor scholar, and if he did not stand  at the head of his class he was not far from it. Sam was also doing his  best, and all of this gratified Captain Putnam exceedingly.    \"It shows they can work as well as play,\" was what the captain told  himself, and he wrote Anderson Rover a long letter, in which he praised  the boys for their efforts.    The boys fell into their places at the academy with a naturalness that  was surprising when one considered the adventures that had but lately  befallen them. Over and over again did they have to tell of their  doings while on the Pacific, and as Crusoes, and some of the cadets  never tired of listening to the stories. A few, including Lew Flapp,  did not believe them true, but the majority did, and that was enough  for the Rovers.    Dick was now advancing in years, and he knew that before long he would  either have to go into business or to college, which he had not yet  fully decided. To tell the truth, the thought of separating from his  brothers was exceedingly distasteful to him.    \"If I went to college I'd like you fellows to be with me,\" he said one  day to Tom "]]]
