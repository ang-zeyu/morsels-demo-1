The  happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness.  I  have no faith in misanthropes.  (Fine word!  Just learned it.) You are  not a misanthrope are you, Daddy?    I started to tell you about the campus.  I wish you'd come for a little  visit and let me walk you about and say:    'That is the library.  This is the gas plant, Daddy dear.  The Gothic  building on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor Romanesque beside  it is the new infirmary.'    Oh, I'm fine at showing people about.  I've done it all my life at the  asylum, and I've been doing it all day here.  I have honestly.    And a Man, too!    That's a great experience.  I never talked to a man before (except  occasional Trustees, and they don't count). Pardon, Daddy, I don't mean  to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees.  I don't consider that you  really belong among them.  You just tumbled on to the Board by chance.  The Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent.  He pats one  on the head and wears a gold watch chain.    That looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any  Trustee except you.    However--to resume:    I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man.  And with a  very superior man--with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia; her  uncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say; he's as tall as you.)  Being in town on business, he decided to run out to the college and  call on his niece.  He's her father's youngest brother, but she doesn't  know him very intimately.  It seems he glanced at her when she was a  baby, decided he didn't like her, and has never noticed her since.    Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper with  his hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie with  seventh-hour recitations that they couldn't cut.  So Julia dashed into  my room and begged me to walk him about the campus and then deliver him  to her when the seventh hour was over.  I said I would, obligingly but  unenthusiastically, because I don't care much for Pendletons.    But he turned out to be a sweet lamb.  He's a real human being--not a  Pendleton at all.  We had a beautiful time; I've longed for an uncle  ever since.  Do you mind pretending you're my uncle?  I believe they're  superior to grandmothers.    Mr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty  years ago.  You see I know you intimately, even if we haven't ever met!    He's tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the  funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just  wrinkles up the corners of his mouth.  And he has a way of making you  feel right off as though you'd known him a long time.  He's very  companionable.    We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic  grounds; then he said he felt weak and must have some tea.  He proposed  that we go to College Inn--it's just off the campus by the pine walk.  I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn't  like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous.  So  we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and ice-cream  and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony.  The inn was quite  conveniently empty, this being the end of the month and allowances low.    We had the jolliest time!  But he had to run for his train the minute  he got back and he barely saw Julia at all.  She was furious with me  for taking him off; it seems he's an unusually rich and desirable  uncle.  It relieved my mind to find he was rich, for the tea and things  cost sixty cents apiece.    This morning (it's Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by  express for Julia and Sallie and me.  What do you think of that?  To be  getting candy from a man!    I begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling.    I wish you'd come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you.  But wouldn't it be dreadful if I didn't? However, I know I should.    Bien!  I make you my compliments.                               'Jamais je ne t'oublierai.'                                                         Judy      PS.  I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly new  dimple that I'd never seen before.  It's very curious.  Where do you  suppose it came from?                                                         9th June    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Happy day!  I've just finished my last examination Physiology.  And now:    Three months on a farm!    I don't know what kind of a thing a farm is.  I've never been on one in  my life.  I've never even looked at one (except from the car window),  but I know I'm going to love it, and I'm going to love being FREE.    I am not used even yet to being outside the John Grier Home.  Whenever  I think of it excited little thrills chase up and down my back.  I feel  as though I must run faster and faster and keep looking over my  shoulder to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn't after me with her arm  stretched out to grab me back.    I don't have to mind any one this summer, do I?    Your nominal authority doesn't annoy me in the least; you are too far  away to do any harm.  Mrs. Lippett is dead for ever, so far as I am  concerned, and the Semples aren't expected to overlook my moral  welfare, are they?  No, I am sure not.  I am entirely grown up.  Hooray!    I leave you now to pack a trunk, and three boxes of teakettles and  dishes and sofa cushions and books.                                       Yours ever,                                                 Judy      PS.  Here is my physiology exam.  Do you think you could have passed?                                     LOCK WILLOW FARM,                                                 Saturday night    Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,    I've only just come and I'm not unpacked, but I can't wait to tell you  how much I like farms.  This is a heavenly, heavenly, HEAVENLY spot!  The house is square like this:  And OLD.  A hundred years or so.  It  has a veranda on the side which I can't draw and a sweet porch in  front.  The picture really doesn't do it justice--those things that  look like feather dusters are maple trees, and the prickly ones that  border the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks.  It stands on the  top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows to another  line of hills.    That is the way Connecticut goes, in a series of Marcelle waves; and  Lock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave.  The barns used to  be across the road where they obstructed the view, but a kind flash of  lightning came from heaven and burnt them down.    The people are Mr. and Mrs. Semple and a hired girl and two hired men.  The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and Judy in the  dining-room. We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey and jelly-cake  and pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supper--and a great deal of  conversation.  I have never been so entertaining in my life; everything  I say appears to be funny.  I suppose it is, because I've never been in  the country before, and my questions are backed by an all-inclusive  ignorance.    The room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed, but  the one that I occupy.  It's big and square and empty, with adorable  old-fashioned furniture and windows that have to be propped up on  sticks and green shades trimmed with gold that fall down if you touch  them.  And a big square mahogany table--I'm going to spend the summer  with my elbows spread out on it, writing a novel.    Oh, Daddy, I'm so excited!  I can't wait till daylight to explore.  It's 8.30 now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to  sleep.  We rise at five.  Did you ever know such fun?  I can't believe  this is really Judy.  You and the Good Lord give me more than I  deserve.  I must be a very, very, VERY good person to pay.  I'm going  to be.  You'll see.                                   Good night,                                                 Judy      PS.  You should hear the frogs sing and the little pigs squeal and you  should see the new moon!  I saw it over my right shoulder.                                                       LOCK WILLOW,                                                         12th July    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow?  (That isn't a  rhetorical question.  I am awfully curious to know.) For listen to  this:  Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm, but now he has given  it to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse.  Did you ever hear of such a  funny coincidence?  She still calls him 'Master Jervie' and talks about  what a sweet little boy he used to be.  She has one of his baby curls  put away in a box, and it is red--or at least reddish!    Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much in her  opinion.  Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best  introduction one can have at Lock Willow.  And the cream of the whole  family is Master Jervis--I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an  inferior branch.    The farm gets more and more entertaining.  I rode on a hay wagon  yesterday.  We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, and you  should see them eat.  They are pigs!  We've oceans of little baby  chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls.  You must be mad to  live in a city when you might live on a farm.    It is my daily business to hunt the eggs.  I fell off a beam in the  barn loft yesterday, while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that  the black hen has stolen.  And when I came in with a scratched knee,  Mrs. Semple bound it up with witch-hazel, murmuring all the time,  'Dear! Dear!  It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off that  very same beam and scratched this very same knee.'    The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful.  There's a valley and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15707"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. I (#7)"],[1,"and organs of sense, possess a  power of contraction. The circumstances attending the exertion of this  power of CONTRACTION constitute the laws of animal motion, as the  circumstances attending the exertion of the power of ATTRACTION constitute  the laws of motion of inanimate matter.    II. The spirit of animation is the immediate cause of the contraction of  animal fibres, it resides in the brain and nerves, and is liable to general  or partial diminution or accumulation.    III. The stimulus of bodies external to the moving organ is the remote  cause of the original contractions of animal fibres.    IV. A certain quantity of stimulus produces irritation, which is an  exertion of the spirit of animation exciting the fibres into contraction.    V. A certain quantity of contraction of animal fibres, if it be perceived  at all, produces pleasure; a greater or less quantity of contraction, if it  be perceived at all, produces pain; these constitute sensation.    VI. A certain quantity of sensation produces desire or aversion; these  constitute volition.    VII. All animal motions which have occurred at the same time, or in  immediate succession, become so connected, that when one of them is  reproduced, the other has a tendency to accompany or succeed it. When  fibrous contractions succeed or accompany other fibrous contractions, the  connection is termed association; when fibrous contractions succeed  sensorial motions, the connexion is termed causation; when fibrous and  sensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other, it is termed  catenation of animal motions. All these connections are said to be produced  by habit, that is, by frequent repetition. These laws of animal causation  will be evinced by numerous facts, which occur in our daily exertions; and  will afterwards be employed to explain the more recondite phaenomena of the  production, growth, diseases, and decay of the animal system.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. V.    OF THE FOUR FACULTIES OR MOTIONS OF THE SENSORIUM.        1. _Four sensorial powers._ 2. _Irritation, sensation, volition,      association defined._ 3. _Sensorial motions distinguished from fibrous      motions._    1. The spirit of animation has four different modes of action, or in other  words the animal sensorium possesses four different faculties, which are  occasionally exerted, and cause all the contractions of the fibrous parts  of the body. These are the faculty of causing fibrous contractions in  consequence of the irritations excited by external bodies, in consequence  of the sensations of pleasure or pain, in consequence of volition, and in  consequence of the associations of fibrous contractions with other fibrous  contractions, which precede or accompany them.    These four faculties of the sensorium during their inactive state are  termed irritability, sensibility, voluntarity, and associability; in their  active state they are termed as above, irritation, sensation, volition,  association.    2. IRRITATION is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the  sensorium residing in the muscles or organs of sense, in consequence of the  appulses of external bodies.    SENSATION is an exertion or change of the central parts of the sensorium,  or of the whole of it, _beginning_ at some of those extreme parts of it,  which reside in the muscles or organs of sense.    VOLITION is an exertion or change of the central parts of the sensorium, or  of the whole of it, _terminating_ in some of those extreme parts of it,  which reside in the muscles or organs of sense.    ASSOCIATION is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the sensorium  residing in the muscles or organs of sense, in consequence of some  antecedent or attendant fibrous contractions.    3. These four faculties of the animal sensorium may at the time of their  exertions be termed motions without impropriety of language; for we cannot  pass from a state of insensibility or inaction to a state of sensibility or  of exertion without some change of the sensorium, and every change includes  motion. We shall therefore sometimes term the above described faculties  _sensorial motions_ to distinguish them from _fibrous motions_; which  latter expression includes the motions of the muscles and organs of sense.    The active motions of the fibres, whether those of the muscles or organs of  sense, are probably simple contractions; the fibres being again elongated  by antagonist muscles, by circulating fluids, or sometimes by elastic  ligaments, as in the necks of quadrupeds. The sensorial motions, which  constitute the sensations of pleasure or pain, and which constitute  volition, and which cause the fibrous contractions in consequence of  irritation or of association, are not here supposed to be fluctuations or  refluctuations of the spirit of animation; nor are they supposed to be  vibrations or revibrations, nor condensations or equilibrations of it; but  to be changes or motions of it peculiar to life.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. VI.    OF THE FOUR CLASSES OF FIBROUS MOTIONS.        I. _Origin of fibrous contractions._ II. _Distribution of them into      four classes, irritative motions, sensitive motions, voluntary motions,      and associate motions, defined._    I. All the fibrous contractions of animal bodies originate from the  sensorium, and resolve themselves into four classes, correspondent with the  four powers or motions of the sensorium above described, and from which  they have their causation.    1. These fibrous contractions were originally caused by the irritations  excited by objects, which are external to the moving organ. As the  pulsations of the heart are owing to the irritations excited by the  stimulus of the blood; and the ideas of perception are owing to the  irritations excited by external bodies.    2. But as painful or pleasurable sensations frequently accompanied those  irritations, by habit these fibrous contractions became causeable by the  sensations, and the irritations ceased to be necessary to their production.  As the secretion of tears in grief is caused by the sensation of pain; and  the ideas of imagination, as in dreams or delirium, are excited by the  pleasure or pain, with which they were formerly accompanied.    3. But as the efforts of the will frequently accompanied these painful or  pleasureable sensations, by habit the fibrous contractions became causable  by volition; and both the irritations and sensations ceased to be necessary  to their production. As the deliberate locomotions of the body, and the  ideas of recollection, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards.    4. But as many of these fibrous contractions frequently accompanied other  fibrous contractions, by habit they became causable by their associations  with them; and the irritations, sensations, and volition, ceased to be  necessary to their production. As the actions of the muscles of the lower  limbs in fencing are associated with those of the arms; and the ideas of  suggestion are associated with other ideas, which precede or accompany  them; as in repeating carelessly the alphabet in its usual order after  having began it.    II. We shall give the following names to these four classes of fibrous  motions, and subjoin their definitions.    1. Irritative motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which is  caused by the appulses of external bodies, either simply subsides, or is  succeeded by sensation, or it produces fibrous motions; it is termed  irritation, and irritative motions are those contractions of the muscular  fibres, or of the organs of sense, that are immediately consequent to this  exertion or change of the sensorium.    2. Sensitive motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which  constitutes pleasure or pain, either simply subsides, or is succeeded by  volition, or it produces fibrous motions; it is termed sensation, and the  sensitive motions are those contractions of the muscular fibres, or of the  organs of sense, that are immediately consequent to this exertion or change  of the sensorium.    3. Voluntary motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which  constitutes desire or aversion, either simply subsides, or is succeeded by  fibrous motions; it is then termed volition, and voluntary motions are  those contractions of the muscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, that  are immediately consequent to this exertion or change of the sensorium.    4. Associate motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which  accompanies fibrous motions, either simply subsides, or is succeeded by  sensation or volition, or it produces other fibrous motions; it is then  termed association, and the associate motions are those contractions of the  muscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, that are immediately consequent  to this exertion or change of the sensorium.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. VII.    OF IRRITATIVE MOTIONS.        I. 1. _Some muscular motions are excited by perpetual irritations._ 2.      _Others more frequently by sensations._ 3. _Others by volition. Case of      involuntary stretchings in paralytic limbs._ 4. _Some sensual motions      are excited by perpetual irritations._ 5. _Others more frequently by      sensation or volition._        II. 1. _Muscular motions excited by perpetual irritations occasionally      become obedient sensation and to volition._ 2. _And the sensual      motions._        III. 1. _Other muscular motions are associated with the irritative      ones._ 2. _And other ideas with irritative ones. Of letters, language,      hieroglyphics. Irritative ideas exist without our attention to them._    I. 1. Many of our muscular motions are excited by perpetual irritations, as  those of the heart and arterial system by the circumfluent blood. Many  other of them are excited by intermitted irritations, as those of the  stomach and bowels by the aliment"]]]
