She raised her eyes to God, and prayed:  \"I supplicate Thy grace, O God, Thou who givest ear to  the cry of the distressed in the hour of his need, answer me,  that I may be spared to bring forth the three holy children,  who will be ready to suffer death by fire, for the sake of the  glory of Thy Name.\" And God granted her petition, and  sent the angel Michael down to succor her. He put the  pledges in a place in which Tamar could not fail to see them,  and she took them, and threw them before the feet of the  judges, with the words: \"By the man whose these are am  I with child, but though I perish in the flames, I will not  betray him. I hope in the Lord of the world, that He will  turn the heart of the man, so that he will make confession  thereof.\" Then Judah rose up, and said: \"With your permission,  my brethren, and ye men of my father's house, I  make it known that with what measure a man metes, it shall  be measured unto him, be it for good or for evil, but happy  the man that acknowledgeth his sins. Because I took the  coat of Joseph, and colored it with the blood of a kid, and  then laid it at the feet of my father, saying, Know now  whether it be thy son's coat or not, therefore must I now  confess, before the court, unto whom belongeth this signet,  this mantle, and this staff. But it is better that I be put to  shame in this world than I should be put to shame in the  other world, before the face of my pious father. It is better  that I should perish in a fire that can be extinguished than  I should be cast into hell fire, which devoureth other fires.  Now, then, I acknowledge that Tamar is innocent. By me  is she with child, not because she indulged in illicit passion,  but because I held back her marriage with my son Shelah.\"  Then a heavenly voice was heard to say: \"Ye are both  innocent! It was the will of God that it should happen!\"[89]    The open confession of Judah induced his oldest brother  Reuben to make public acknowledgment of the sin he had  committed against his father, for he had kept it a secret until  then.[90]    Tamar gave birth to twin sons, Perez and Zerah, both  resembling their father in bravery and piety.[91] She called  the first Perez, \"mighty,\" because she said, \"Thou didst  show thyself of great power, and it is meet and proper that  thou shouldst be strong, for thou art destined to possess the  kingdom.\"[92] The second son was called Zerah, because he  appeared from out of the womb before his brother, but he  was forced back again to make way for Perez.[93] These two,  Perez and Zerah. were sent out as spies by Joshua, and the  line that Rahab bound in the window of her house as a  token to the army of the Israelites, she received from Zerah.  It was the scarlet thread that the midwife had bound upon  his hand, to mark him as the child that appeared first and  withdrew.[94]      THE WIVES OF THE SONS OF JACOB    Judah was the first of the sons of Jacob to enter wedlock.  After the sale of Joseph to the Midianites, his brethren had  said to Judah, \"If conditions were as before, our father  would provide wives for us now. As it is, he is entirely absorbed  by his grief for Joseph, and we must look about for  wives ourselves. Thou art our chief, and thou shouldst  marry first.\"    Judah's marriage with Alit the daughter of the noble  merchant Shua, which was consummated at Adullam, the  residence of his friend Hirah, or, as he was called later,  Hiram, king of Tyre, was not happy. His two oldest sons  died, and shortly thereafter his wife also. It was Judah's  punishment for having begun a good deed and left it unfinished,  for \"he who begins a good deed, and does not execute  it to the end, brings down misfortune upon his own head.\"  Judah had rescued Joseph from death, but it was his suggestion  to sell him into slavery. Had he urged them to  restore the lad to his father, his brethren would have obeyed  his words. He was lacking in constancy to persist until he  had completed the work of Joseph's deliverance, which he  had begun.[95]    In the same year, the year of Joseph's misfortune, all his  other brethren married, too. Reuben's wife was named  Elyoram, the daughter of the Canaanite Uzzi of Timnah.  Simon married his sister Dinah first, and then a second wife.  When Simon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem, Dinah  refused to leave the city and follow her brethren, saying,  \"Whither shall I carry my shame?\" But Simon swore he  would marry her, as he did later, and when she died in  Egypt, he took her body to the Holy Land and buried it  there. Dinah bore her brother a son,[96] and from her union  with Shechem, the son of Hamor, sprang a daughter, Asenath  by name, afterward the wife of Joseph. When this daughter  was born to Dinah, her brethren, the sons of Jacob,  wanted to kill her, that the finger of men might not point at  the fruit of sin in their father's house. But Jacob took a  piece of tin, inscribed the Holy Name upon it, and bound it  about the neck of the girl, and he put her under a thornbush,  and abandoned her there. An angel carried the babe  down to Egypt, where Potiphar adopted her as his child,  for his wife was barren. Years thereafter, when Joseph  travelled through the land as viceroy, the maidens threw  gifts at him, to make him turn his eyes in their direction  and give them the opportunity of gazing upon his beauty.  Asenath possessed nothing that would do as a present, therefore  she took off the amulet suspended from her neck, and  gave it to him. Thus Joseph became acquainted with her  lineage, and he married her, seeing that she was not an  Egyptian, but one connected with the house of Jacob  through her mother.[97]    Beside the son of Dinah, Simon had another son, whose  name was Saul, by Bunah, the damsel he had taken captive  in the campaign against Shechem.    Levi and Issachar married two daughters of Jobab, the  grandson of Eber; the wife of the former was named  Adinah, the wife of the latter, Aridah. Dan's wife was  Elflalet, a daughter of the Moabite Hamudan. For a long  time their marriage remained childless, finally they had a  son, whom they called Hushim. Gad and Naphtali married  women from Haran, two sisters, daughters of Amoram, a  grandson of Nahor. Naphtali's wife, Merimit, was the  older of the two, and the younger, the wife of Gad, was  named Uzit.    Asher's first wife was Adon, the daughter of Ephlal, a  grandson of Ishmael. She died childless, and he married a  second wife, Hadorah, a daughter of Abimael, the grandson  of Shem. She had been married before, her first husband  having been Malchiel, also a grandson of Shem, and the  issue of this first marriage was a daughter, Serah by  name. When Asher brought his wife to Canaan, the three  year old orphan Serah came with them. She was raised in  the house of Jacob, and she walked in the way of pious  children, and God gave her beauty, wisdom, and sagacity.    Zebulon's wife was Maroshah, the daughter of Molad, a  grandson of Midian, the son of Abraham by Keturah.    For Benjamin, when he was but ten years old, Jacob took  Mahlia to wife, the daughter of Aram, the grandson of  Terah, and she bore him five sons. At the age of eighteen  he married a second wife, Arbat, the daughter of Zimran,  a son of Abraham by Keturah, and by her also he had five  sons.[98]      JOSEPH THE SLAVE OF POTIPHAR    When Joseph was sold as a slave to the Ishmaelites, he  kept silent out of respect for his brethren, and did not tell  his masters that he was a son of Jacob, a great and powerful  man. Even when he came to the Midianites with the Ishmaelites,  and the former asked after his parentage, he still  said he was a slave, only in order not to put his brethren to  shame. But the most distinguished of the Midianites rebuked  Joseph, saying, \"Thou art no slave, thy appearance  betrayeth thee,\" and he threatened him with death unless he  acknowledged the truth. Joseph, however, was steadfast,  he would not act treacherously toward his brethren.    Arrived in Egypt, the owners of Joseph could come to no  agreement regarding him. Each desired to have sole and  exclusive possession of him. They therefore decided to  leave him with a shopkeeper until they should come back to  Egypt again with their merchandise. And God let Joseph  find grace in the sight of the shopkeeper. All that he had,  his whole house, he put into Joseph's hand, and therefore  the Lord blessed him with much silver and gold, and Joseph  remained with him for three months and five days.    At that time there came from Memphis the wife of Potiphar,  and she cast her eyes upon Joseph, of whose comeliness  of person she had heard from the eunuchs. She  told her husband how that a certain shopkeeper had grown  rich through a young Hebrew, and she added: \"But it is  said that the youth was stolen away out of the land of  Canaan. Go, therefore, and sit in judgment upon his owner,  and take the youth unto thy house, that the God of the  Hebrews may bless thee, for the grace of heaven rests upon  the youth.\"    Potiphar summoned the shopkeeper, and when he appeared  before him, he spoke harshly to him, saying: \"What  is this I hear? that thou stealest souls from the land of  Canaan, and dost carry on traffic with them?\" The shop-keeper  protested his innocence, and he could not be made to  recede from his assertion, that a company of Ishmaelites  had left Joseph in his charge temporarily, until they should  return. Potiphar had him stripped naked and beaten, but  he continued to reiterate the same statement.    Then Potiphar summoned Joseph. The youth prostrated  himself before this chief of the eunuchs, for he was third in  rank of the officers of Pharaoh. And he addressed Joseph,  and said, \"Art thou a slave or a free-born man?\" and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14958"],[0,"Mother West Wind 'Why' Stories (#7)"],[1,"and yellow  waistcoat and half closed his eyes, as if looking way, way back into  the past.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" he began. \"A long, long time ago, when the world was  young, there was very little dry land, and most of the animals lived  in the water. Yes, Sir, most of the animals lived in the water, as  sensible animals do to-day.\"    Peter nudged Johnny Chuck. \"He means himself and his family,\" he  whispered with a chuckle.    \"After a time,\" continued Grandfather Frog, \"there began to be more  land and still more. Then some of the animals began to spend most of  their time on the land. As there got to be more and more land, more  and more of the animals left the water, until finally most of them  were spending nearly all of the time on land. Now Old Mother Nature  had been keeping a sharp watch, as she always does, and when she found  that they were foolish enough to like the land best, she did all that  she could to make things comfortable for them. She taught them how to  run and jump and climb and dig, according to which things they liked  best to do, so that it wasn't very long before a lot of them forgot  that they ever had lived in the water, and they began to look down on  those who still lived in the water, and to put on airs and hold their  heads very high.    \"Now, of course, Old Mother Nature didn't like this, and to punish  them she said that they should no longer be able to live in the water,  even if they wanted to. At first they only laughed, but after a while  they found that quite often there were times when it would be very  nice to be at home in the water as they once had been. But it was of  no use. Some could swim as long as they could keep their heads above  water, but as soon as they put their heads under water they were  likely to drown. You know that is the way with you to-day, Peter  Rabbit.\"    Peter nodded. He knew that he could swim if he had to, but only for a  very little way, and he hated the thought of it.    \"Now there were a few animals, of whom old Mr. Muskrat, the  grandfather a thousand times removed of Jerry Muskrat, was one, who  learned to walk and run on dry land, but who still loved the water,\"  continued Grandfather Frog. \"One day Old Mother Nature found Mr.  Muskrat sitting on a rock, looking very mournful.    \"'What's the matter, Mr. Muskrat?' she asked.    \"Mr. Muskrat looked very much ashamed as he finally owned up that he  was envious of his cousins and some of the other animals, because they  had such fine houses on the land.    \"'Then why don't you build you a fine house on the land?' asked Old  Mother Nature.    \"Mr. Muskrat hesitated. 'I--I--love the water too well to want to stay  on land all the time,' said he, 'and--and--well, I was put in the  water in the first place, and I ought to be contented with what I have  got and make the best of it.'    \"Old Mother Nature was so pleased with Mr. Muskrat's reply that right  away she made up her mind that he should have a finer house than any  of the others, so she took him over to a quiet little pool, where the  water was not too deep and she showed him how to build a wonderful  house of mud and rushes and twigs, with a nice warm bedroom lined  with grass above the water, and an entrance down under the water, so  that no one except those who still lived most of the time in the water  could possibly get into it. None of his friends on land had such a  big, fine house, and Mr. Muskrat was very proud of it. But with all  his pride he never forgot that it was a reward for trying to be  content with his surroundings and making the best of them.    \"So from that day to this, the Muskrats have built their houses in the  water, and have been among the most industrious, contented, and happy  of all the animals. And that is why Jerry Muskrat has built that fine  house in the Smiling Pool and has so few enemies,\" concluded  Grandfather Frog.    Peter Rabbit drew a long breath, which was almost a sigh. \"I almost  wish my grandfather a thousand times removed had been content to stay  in the water, too,\" he said.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" retorted Grandfather Frog. \"If he had, you wouldn't have  the dear Old Briar-patch. Be content with what you've got,\"    \"I think I will,\" said Peter.          VIII    WHY OLD MAN COYOTE HAS MANY VOICES      Of course Old Man Coyote has only one voice, but that one is such a  wonderful voice that he can make it sound like a great many voices,  all yelping and howling and shouting and laughing at the same time. So  those who hear him always say that he has many voices, and that  certainly is the way it seems. The first time Peter Rabbit heard Old  Man Coyote, he was sure, absolutely sure, that there was a whole crowd  of strangers on the Green Meadows, and you may be sure that he kept  very close to his dear Old Briar-patch. If you had been there and  tried to tell Peter that all that noise was made by just one voice,  he wouldn't have believed you. No, Sir, he wouldn't have believed you.  And you couldn't have blamed him.    It was the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind who first told  Peter who the stranger was and warned him to watch out, because Old  Man Coyote is just as fond of Rabbit as Granny or Reddy Fox, and is  even more crafty and sly than they. Peter thanked the Merry Little  Breezes for the warning, and then he asked them how many of his family  Old Man Coyote had brought with him. Of course the Merry Little  Breezes told Peter that Old Man Coyote was all alone, and they became  very indignant when Peter laughed at them. He just couldn't help it.    \"Why,\" said he, \"every night I hear a whole crowd yelping and howling  together.\"    \"But you don't!\" insisted the Merry Little Breezes. \"It is Old Man  Coyote alone who makes all that noise.\"    \"Don't you suppose I know what I hear?\" demanded Peter.    \"No!\" retorted the Merry Little Breezes. \"You may have big ears and be  able to hear a great deal, sometimes a great deal more than you have  any business to hear, but you are old enough by this time to have  learned that you cannot believe all you hear.\" And with that the Merry  Little Breezes indignantly raced away to spread the news all over the  Green Meadows.    Now Peter was quite as indignant because they thought he couldn't or  shouldn't believe his own ears, as they were because he wouldn't  believe what they told him, and all the rest of that day he couldn't  put the matter out of his mind. He was still thinking of it as the  Black Shadows came creeping down from the Purple Hills across the  Green Meadows. Suddenly Peter saw a dark form skulking among the Black  Shadows. At first he thought it was Reddy Fox, only somehow it looked  bigger. Peter, safe in the dear Old Briar-patch, watched. Presently  the dark form came out from among the Black Shadows where Peter could  see it clearly, sat down, pointed a sharp nose up at the first  twinkling little stars, opened a big mouth, and out of it poured such  a yelping and howling as made Peter shiver with fright. And now Peter  had to believe his eyes rather than his ears. His ears told him that  there were many voices, but his eyes told him that all that dreadful  sound was coming out of one mouth. It was hard, very hard, to believe,  but it was so.    \"The Merry Little Breezes were right,\" muttered Peter to himself, as  Old Man Coyote trotted away in the direction of the Green Forest, and  he felt a wee bit ashamed to think that he had refused to believe  them.    After that, Peter could think of nothing but Old Man Coyote's  wonderful voice that sounded like many voices, and at the very first  opportunity he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to ask Grandfather  Frog what it meant.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog. \"It means simply that Old Man  Coyote comes of a very smart family, and that he knows how to make the  most of the gift of Old Mother Nature to his grandfather a thousand  times removed.\"    This sounded so much like a story that Peter straightway teased  Grandfather Frog to tell him all about it. At last, to get rid of him  and enjoy a little quiet and peace, Grandfather Frog did so.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" he began, as he always does. \"The  great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Old Man Coyote, who lived  long, long ago when the world was young, was very much as Old Man  Coyote is to-day. He was just as smart and just as clever. Indeed, he  was smart enough and clever enough not to let his neighbors know that  he was smart and clever at all. Those were very peaceful times at  first, and everybody was on the best of terms with everybody else, as  you know. There was plenty to eat without the trouble to steal, and  everybody was honest simply because it was easier to be honest than it  was to be dishonest. So Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest, and  everybody was happy and contented.    \"But there came a time when food was scarce, and it was no longer  easy to get plenty to eat. It was then that the stronger began to  steal from the weaker, and by and by even to prey upon those smaller  than themselves. The times grew harder and harder, and because hunger  is a hard and cruel master, it made the larger and stronger people  hard and cruel, too. Some of them it made very sly and cunning, like  old Mr. Fox. Mr. Coyote was another whom it made sly and cunning. He  was smart in the first place, even smarter than Mr. Fox, and he very  early made up his mind that if he would live, it must be by his wits,  for he wasn't big enough or strong enough to fight with his neighbors  such as his big cousin, Mr. Timber Wolf, or Mr. Lynx, or Mr. Panther  or Old King Bear, who was king no longer. And yet he liked the same  things to eat.    \"So he used to study and plan how he could outwit them without danger  to himself. 'A whole skin is better than a full stomach, but both a  whole skin and a full stomach are better still,' said he to himself;  as he thought and schemed. For a while he was content to catch what he  could"]]]
