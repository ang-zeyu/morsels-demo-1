The following extract, taken from a letter of a subsequent date, in  addition to the above letter, throws still further light upon the  heart-rending affair, and shows Mr. Johnston's deep sympathy with the  sufferers and the oppressed generally--        EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM REV. N.R. JOHNSTON.            My heart bleeds when I think of those poor, hunted and      heart-broken fugitives, though a most interesting family, taken      back to bondage ten-fold worse than Egyptian. And then poor      Concklin! How my heart expanded in love to him, as he told me      his adventures, his trials, his toils, his fears and his hopes!      After hearing all, and then seeing and communing with the      family, now joyful in hopes of soon seeing their husband and      father in the land of freedom; now in terror lest the human      blood-hounds should be at their heels, I felt as though I could      lay down my life in the cause of the oppressed. In that hour or      two of intercourse with Peter's family, my heart warmed with      love to them. I never saw more interesting young men. They would      make Remonds or Douglasses, if they had the same opportunities.        While I was with them, I was elated with joy at their escape,      and yet, when I heard their tale of woe, especially that of the      mother, I could not suppress tears of deepest emotion.        My joy was short-lived. Soon I heard of their capture. The      telegraph had been the means of their being claimed. I could      have torn down all the telegraph wires in the land. It was a      strange dispensation of Providence.        On Saturday the sad news of their capture came to my ears. We      had resolved to go to their aid on Monday, as the trial was set      for Thursday. On Sabbath, I spoke from Psalm xii. 5. \"For the      oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I      arise,\" saith the Lord: \"I will set him in safety from him that      puffeth at (from them that would enslave) him.\" When on Monday      morning I learned that the fugitives had passed through the      place on Sabbath, and Concklin in chains, probably at the very      time I was speaking on the subject referred to, my heart sank      within me. And even yet, I cannot but exclaim, when I think of      it--O, Father! how long ere Thou wilt arise to avenge the wrongs      of the poor slave! Indeed, my dear brother, His ways are very      mysterious. We have the consolation, however, to know that all      is for the best. Our Redeemer does all things well. When He hung      upon the cross, His poor broken hearted disciples could not      understand the providence; it was a dark time to them; and yet      that was an event that was fraught with more joy to the world      than any that has occurred or could occur. Let us stand at our      post and wait God's time. Let us have on the whole armor of God,      and fight for the right, knowing, that though we may fall in      battle, the victory will be ours, sooner or later.                 *       *       *       *       *          May God lead you into all truth, and sustain you in your labors,      and fulfill your prayers and hopes. Adieu.        N.R. JOHNSTON.          LETTERS FROM LEVI COFFIN.      The following letters on the subject were received from the untiring and  devoted friend of the slave, Levi Coffin, who for many years had  occupied in Cincinnati a similar position to that of Thomas Garrett in  Delaware, a sentinel and watchman commissioned of God to succor the  fleeing bondman--          CINCINNATI, 4TH MO., 10TH, 1851.        FRIEND WM. STILL:--We have sorrowful news from our friend      Concklin, through the papers and otherwise. I received a letter      a few days ago from a friend near Princeton, Ind., stating that      Concklin and the four slaves are in prison in Vincennes, and      that their trial would come on in a few days. He states that      they rowed seven days and nights in the skiff, and got safe to      Harmony, Ind., on the Wabash river, thence to Princeton, and      were conveyed to Vincennes by friends, where they were taken.      The papers state, that they were all given up to the Marshal of      Evansville, Indiana.        We have telegraphed to different points, to try to get some      information concerning them, but failed. The last information is      published in the _Times_ of yesterday, though quite incorrect in      the particulars of the case. Inclosed is the slip containing it.      I fear all is over in regard to the freedom of the slaves. If      the last account be true, we have some hope that Concklin will      escape from those bloody tyrants. I cannot describe my feelings      on hearing this sad intelligence. I feel ashamed to own my      country. Oh! what shall I say. Surely a God of justice will      avenge the wrongs of the oppressed.        Thine for the poor slave,        LEVI COFFIN.        N.B.--If thou hast any information, please write me forthwith.                CINCINNATI, 5TH MO., 11TH, 1851.        WM. STILL:--_Dear Friend_--Thy letter of 1st inst., came duly to      hand, but not being able to give any further information      concerning our friend, Concklin, I thought best to wait a little      before I wrote, still hoping to learn something more definite      concerning him.        We that became acquainted with Seth Concklin and his hazardous      enterprises (here at Cincinnati), who were very few, have felt      intense and inexpressible anxiety about them. And particularly      about poor Seth, since we heard of his falling into the hands of      the tyrants. I fear that he has fallen a victim to their inhuman      thirst for blood.        I seriously doubt the rumor, that he had made his escape. I fear      that he was sacrificed.        Language would fail to express my feelings; the intense and deep      anxiety I felt about them for weeks before I heard of their      capture in Indiana, and then it seemed too much to bear. O! my      heart almost bleeds when I think of it. The hopes of the dear      family all blasted by the wretched blood-hounds in human shape.      And poor Seth, after all his toil, and dangerous, shrewd and      wise management, and almost unheard of adventures, the many      narrow and almost miraculous escapes. Then to be given up to      Indianians, to these fiendish tyrants, to be sacrificed. O!      Shame, Shame!!        My heart aches, my eyes fill with tears, I cannot write more. I      cannot dwell longer on this painful subject now. If you get any      intelligence, please inform me. Friend N.R. Johnston, who took      so much interest in them, and saw them just before they were      taken, has just returned to the city. He is a minister of the      Covenanter order. He is truly a lovely man, and his heart is      full of the milk of humanity; one of our best Anti-Slavery      spirits. I spent last evening with him. He related the whole      story to me as he had it from friend Concklin and the mother and      children, and then the story of their capture. We wept together.      He found thy letter when he got here.        He said he would write the whole history to thee in a few days,      as far as he could. He can tell it much better than I can.        Concklin left his carpet sack and clothes here with me, except a      shirt or two he took with him. What shall I do with them? For if      we do not hear from him soon, we must conclude that he is lost,      and the report of his escape all a hoax.        Truly thy friend,        LEVI COFFIN.      Stunning and discouraging as this horrible ending was to all concerned,  and serious as the matter looked in the eyes of Peter's friends with  regard to Peter's family, he could not for a moment abandon the idea of  rescuing them from the jaws of the destroyer. But most formidable  difficulties stood in the way of opening correspondence with reliable  persons in Alabama. Indeed it seemed impossible to find a merchant,  lawyer, doctor, planter or minister, who was not too completely  interlinked with slavery to be relied upon to manage a negotiation of  this nature. Whilst waiting and hoping for something favorable to turn  up, the subjoined letter from the owner of Peter's family was received  and is here inserted precisely as it was written, spelled and  punctuated--        McKIERNON'S LETTER.

So he sat there in the  bushes thinking what he had better do, when all at once, before he could  wiggle his ears more than four times, a great big, bad, ugly dog sprang at  him, barking, oh! so loudly.    \"Come on, Browser!\" cried this dog to another one. \"Here is a fat rabbit  that we can catch for dinner. Come on, let's chase him!\"    Well, you can just imagine how frightened Uncle Wiggily was. He didn't sit  there, waiting for that dog to catch him, either. No, indeed, and a bag of  popcorn besides! Up jumped Uncle Wiggily, with his crutch and his valise,  and he hopped as hard and as fast as he could run. My! How his legs did  twist in and out.    \"Come on! Come!\" barked the first dog to the second one.    \"I'm coming! I'm coming! Woof! Woof! Bow-w-w Bow-wow!\" barked the second  dog.    Poor Uncle Wiggily's heart beat faster and faster, and he didn't know  which way to run. Every way he turned the dogs were after him, and soon  more of the savage animals came to join the first two, until all the dogs  in that Gypsy camp were chasing the poor old gentleman rabbit.    \"I guess I'll have to drop my satchel or my crutch,\" thought Uncle  Wiggily. \"I can't carry them much farther. Still, I don't want to lose  them.\" So he held on to them a little longer, took a good breath and ran  on some more.    He thought he saw a chance to escape by running across in front of the  fortune-telling tent, and he started that way, but a Gypsy man, with a  gun, saw him and fired at him. I'm glad to say, however, that he didn't  shoot Uncle Wiggily, or else I couldn't tell any more stories about him.    Uncle Wiggily got safely past the tent, but the dogs were almost up to him  now. One of them was just going to catch him by his left hind leg, when  one of the Gypsy men cried out:    \"Grab him, Biter! Grab him! We'll have rabbit potpie for dinner; that's  what we'll have!\"    Wasn't that a perfectly dreadful way to talk about our Uncle Wiggily? But  just wait, if you please.    Biter, the bad dog, was just going to grab the rabbit, when all of a  sudden, Uncle Wiggily saw a big hole in the ground.    \"That's what I'm looking for!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm going down there, and  hide away from these dogs!\"    So into the hole he popped, valise, crutch and all, and oh! how glad he  was to get into the cool, quiet darkness, leaving those savage, barking  dogs outside. But wait a moment longer, if you please.    Biter and Browser stopped short at the hole.    \"He's gone--gotten clean away!\" exclaimed Browser. \"Isn't that too bad?\"    \"No, we'll get him yet!\" cried Biter. \"Here, you watch at this hole, while  I go get a pail of water. We'll pour the water down, under the ground  where the rabbit is, and that will make him come out, and we'll eat him.\"    \"Good!\" cried Browser. So while he stood there and watched, Biter went  for the water. But, mind you, Uncle Wiggily had sharp ears and he heard  what they were saying, and what do you think he did?    Why, with his sharp claws he went right to work, and he dug, and dug, and  dug in the back part of that underground place, until he had made another  hole, far off from the first one, and he crawled out of that, with his  crutch and valise, just as Biter was pouring the water down the first  hole.    \"Ah, ha! I think this will astonish those dogs!\" thought Uncle Wiggily,  and he took a peep at them from behind a bush where they couldn't see him,  and then he hopped on through the woods, to look for more adventures,  leaving the dogs still pouring water.    And one happened to him shortly after that, as I shall tell you on the  next page, when, in case the rocking chair doesn't tip over backwards and  spill out the sofa cushion into the rubber plant, the story will be about  Uncle Wiggily and the monkey.          STORY X    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MONKEY      Let me see, we left those two bad dogs pouring water down the hole, to get  Uncle Wiggily out, didn't we? And the old gentleman rabbit fooled them,  didn't he? He got out of another hole that he dug around by the back door,  you remember.    Well, I just wish you could have seen those two dogs, after they had  poured pail after pail of water down the hole, and no rabbit came floating  up.    \"This hole must go all the way down to China!\" said Browser, breathing  very fast.    \"Yes, I'm tired of carrying water,\" said Biter. And just then another dog  cried out:    \"Why, foolish dogs, the water's all running out the back way!\" And, surely  enough, it was. Then they knew Uncle Wiggily had escaped, and they were as  angry as anything, but it served them right, I think.    \"My! I wonder what will happen next?\" thought the old gentleman rabbit, as  he hopped along. \"That was a narrow escape.\"    So, having nothing else to do, Uncle Wiggily sat down on a nice, smooth  stump, and he ate some lunch out of his valise. And a red ant came up, and  very politely asked if she might not pick up the crumbs which the old  rabbit dropped.    \"Of course you may,\" said Uncle Wiggily kindly. \"And I'll give you a whole  slice of bread and butter, also.\"    \"Oh, you are too generous,\" spoke the red ant. \"I never could carry a  slice of bread and butter. But if you will leave it on the stump I'll get  some of my friends, and we'll bite off little crumbs, a few at a time, and  in that way carry it to our houses.\"    So that's what Uncle Wiggily did, and the ants had a fine feast, and they  were very thankful. Uncle Wiggily asked them if they knew where he could  find his fortune.    \"Why don't you go to work, instead of traveling around so much?\" asked the  biggest red ant. \"The best fortune is the one you work for.\"    \"Is it? I never thought of that,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I will look for  work at once. I wonder if you ants have any for me.\"    \"We'd like to help you,\" they said, \"but you see you are so large that you  couldn't get into our houses to do any work. You had much better travel  along, and work for some one larger than we are.\"    \"I will,\" decided the old gentleman rabbit. \"I'll ask every one I meet if  they want me to work for them.\"    So he started off once more, and the first place he came to was a house  where a mouse lady lived.    \"Have you any work I can do?\" asked Uncle Wiggily politely.    \"What work can you do?\" asked the mouse lady.    \"Well, I can peel carrots or turnips with my teeth,\" said Uncle Wiggily,  \"and I can look after children, and tell them stories, and I can do some  funny tricks----\"    \"Then you had better go join a circus,\" interrupted the mouse lady. \"I  have no children, and I can peel my own carrots, thank you. As for  turnips, I never eat them.\"    \"Then I must go on a little further,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he picked up  his valise, and walked off on his crutch. So he went on, until he came to  another house in the woods, and he knocked on the door.    \"Have you any work I can do?\" inquired Uncle Wiggily politely.    \"No! Get away and don't bother me!\" growled a most unpleasant voice, and  the rabbit was just going down the steps, when the door opened a crack,  and a long, sharp nose and a mouth full of sharp teeth, and some long  legs with sharp claws on them, were stuck out.    \"Oh, hold on!\" cried the voice. \"I guess I can find some work for you  after all. You can get up a dinner for me!\" and then the savage creature,  who had opened the door, made a grab for the rabbit and nearly caught him.  Only Uncle Wiggily jumped away, just in time, and the wolf, for he it was  who had called out, caught his own tail in the crack of the door and  howled most frightfully.    \"Come back! Come back!\" cried the wolf, but, of course, Uncle Wiggily  wouldn't do such a foolish thing as that, and the wolf couldn't chase  after him, for his tail was fast in the door hinge.    \"My, I must be more careful after this how I knock at doors, and ask for  work,\" the old gentleman rabbit thought. \"I was nearly caught that time.  I'll try again, and I may have better luck.\"    So he walked along through the woods, and pretty soon he heard a voice  singing, and this is the song, as nearly as I can remember it:        Here I sit and wonder      What I'm going to do.      I've no one to help me,      I think it's sad; don't you?        I have to play the fiddle,      But still I'd give a cent      To any one who'd keep the boys      From crawling in the tent.    \"Well, I wonder who that can be?\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"He'll give a  cent, eh? to any one who keeps the boys from crawling in the tent. Now, if  that isn't a bear or a fox or a wolf maybe I can work for him, and earn  that money. I'll try.\"    So he peeped out of the bushes, and there he saw a nice monkey, all  dressed up in a clown's suit, spotted red, white and blue. And the monkey  was playing a tune on a fiddle. Then, all of a sudden, he laid aside the  fiddle, and began to beat the bass drum. Then he blew on a horn, next he  jumped up and down, and turned a somersault, and then, finally, he grabbed  up a whip with a whistle in the tail--I mean in the end--and that monkey  began to pretend he was chasing make-believe boys from around a real tent  that was in a little place under the trees.    \"Oh, I guess that monkey won't hurt me,\" said Uncle Wiggily as he stepped  boldly out, and as soon as the monkey saw the rabbit, he called most  politely:    \"Well, what do you want?\"    \"I want to earn a cent, by chasing boys from out the tent,\" replied Uncle  Wiggily.    \"Good!\" cried the monkey. \"So you heard me sing? I'm tired of being the  whole show. I need some one to help me. Come over here and I'll explain  all about it. If you like it, you can go to work for me, and if you do,  your fortune is as good as made.\"    \"That's fine!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"And I can do tricks in the show,  too.\"    \"Fine!\" exclaimed the monkey, hanging by his tail from a green apple tree.  \"Now,"]]]
