He had  inherited through his mother, from her grim old Puritan ancestors, the  positive opinions and unquenchable sense of duty that constitute the  far-famed New England conscience. He was born with a repugnance to  slavery, whether of the will or of the body, and grew to manhood in the  days when the question of the extension of negro slavery to the states  and territories was the subject of fierce debate throughout the union.  He had fixed convictions on the subject when he left Newfane, and he  carried them with him to the farther bank of the Mississippi.    It is to the uncompromising New England conscience of Roswell Field  that his countrymen owe the institution of the proceedings that finally  developed into the Dred Scott case, in which the question of the legal  status of a negro was passed upon by the Supreme Court of the United  States. This is very properly regarded as the most celebrated of the  many important cases adjudicated by our highest tribunal, for not only  did it settle the status of Dred Scott temporarily, but the decision  handed down by Chief Justice Taney is the great classic of a great  bench. It denied the legal existence of the African race as persons in  American society and in constitutional law, and also denied the  supremacy of Congress over the territories and the constitutionality of  the \"Missouri Compromise.\" Four years of civil war were necessary to  overrule this sweeping opinion of Chief Justice Taney's, which is still  referred to with awe and veneration by a large minority, if not by a  majority, of the legal profession.    To Roswell Field belongs the honor of instituting the original action  for Dred Scott, without fee or expectation of compensation. The details  of this celebrated case, after it got into the United States courts,  are a part of the history of our country. What I am about to relate is  scarcely known outside of the old Court House and Hall of Records in  St. Louis.    Dred Scott was a negro slave of Dr. Emerson, a surgeon in the United  States Army, then stationed in Missouri. Dr. Emerson took Scott with  him when, in 1834, he moved to Illinois, a free state, and subsequently  to Fort Snelling, Wis. This territory, being north of 36 degrees and 30  minutes, was free soil under the Missouri Compromise of 1820. At Fort  Snelling, Scott married a colored woman who had also been taken as a  slave from Missouri. When Dr. Emerson returned to Missouri he brought  Dred Scott, his wife, and child with him. The case came to the  attention of Roswell Field, and at once enlisted all his human sympathy  and great legal ability. His first petition to the Circuit Court for  the County of St. Louis is too important and unique a human document  not to be preserved in full. It reads:      Your petitioner, a man of color, respectfully represents that    sometime in the year 1835 your petitioner was purchased as a slave    by one John Emerson, since deceased, who afterwards, to wit, about    the year 1836 or 1839, conveyed your petitioner from the State of    Missouri to Fort Snelling, a fort then occupied by the troops of the    United States, and under the jurisdiction of the United States,    situated in the territory ceded by France to the United States under    the name of Louisiana, lying North of 36 degrees and 30 minutes    North latitude, not included within the limits of the State of    Missouri; and resided and continued to reside at said Fort Snelling    for upwards of one year, and holding your petitioner in slavery at    said Fort during all that time; in violation of the act of Congress    of March 6th, 1820, entitled \"An act to authorize the people of    Missouri Territory to form a constitution and State government and    for the admission of such state into the Union on an equal footing    with the original states and to prohibit slavery in certain    territories.\"      Your petitioner avers that said Emerson has since departed this    life, leaving a widow, Irene Emerson, and an infant child whose name    is unknown to your petitioner, and that one Alexander Sandford has    administered upon the estate of said Emerson and that your    petitioner is now unlawfully held by said Sandford as said    Administrator and said Irene Emerson who claims your petitioner as    part of the estate of said Emerson and by one said Samuel Russell.      Your petitioner therefore prays your Honorable Court to grant him    leave to sue as a free person in order to establish his right to    freedom and that the necessary orders may be made in the premises.      (Signed) DRED SCOTT.      his DRED X SCOTT mark      Sworn to and subscribed before me this 1st day July, 1847,    PETER W. JOHNSTONE, J.P.      Upon reading the above petition this day, it being the opinion of    the Judge of the Circuit Court that the said petition contains    sufficient matter to authorize the commencement of a suit for his    freedom, it is hereby ordered that the said petitioner, Dred Scott,    be allowed to sue, on giving security satisfactory to the Clerk of    the Circuit Court for all costs that may be adjudged against him,    and that he have reasonable liberty to attend his counsel and the    Court as occasion may require, and that he be not subjected to any    severity on account of this application for his freedom and that he    be not removed out of the jurisdiction of the Court.      A. HAMILTON,    _Judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court, 8th Judicial Circuit, Mo._    July 2d, 1847.    Having obtained the desired leave to sue from Judge Alexander Hamilton,  Roswell Field procured Joseph Charless, one of the leading citizens of  St. Louis, to execute the necessary bond for costs. Then he lost no  time in filing the following complaint, which I have no doubt Eugene  Field would have mortgaged many weeks' salary to number among his most  precious possessions. He would have cherished it above the Gladstone  axe, for, while that felled mighty oaks, this brief document laid the  axe at the root of a deadly upas-tree which threatened the destruction  of a free republic. I offer no apology for its insertion here:      STATE OF MISSOURI, ) COUNTY OF ST. LOUIS) ss.      CIRCUIT COURT OF ST. LOUIS, ST. LOUIS COUNTY. November Term, 1847.      Dred Scott, a man of color, by his attorneys, plaintiff in this    suit, complains of Alexander Sandford as administrator of the estate    of John Emerson deceased, Irene Emerson and Samuel Russell,    defendants of a plea of trespass. For that the said defendants    heretofore, to wit on the 1st day of July in the year 1846 at to wit    the County of St. Louis aforesaid with force and arms assaulted the    said plaintiff and then and there, beat, bruised, and ill-treated    him and then and there imprisoned and kept and detained him in    prison there without any reasonable or probable cause whatsoever,    for a long time, to wit for the space of one year, then next    following, contrary to law and against the will of the said    plaintiff; and the said plaintiff avers that before and at the time    of the committing of the grievances aforesaid, he the said plaintiff    was then and there and still is a free person, and that the said    defendants held and still hold him in slavery, and other wrongs to    the said plaintiff then and there did against the peace of the State    of Missouri to the damage of the said plaintiff in the sum of ($300)    Three Hundred Dollars, and therefore he sues.      FIELD & HALL, _Attys. for Plff._    With this brief and bald complaint for trespass to the person and false  imprisonment was begun a long and stubbornly fought litigation,  extending over ten years, and which was destined to end in Chief  Justice Taney declaring:      They [negroes] had for more than a century before [the Declaration    of Independence] been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and    altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social    or political relations; and so far inferior that they had no rights    which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might    justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was    bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise    and traffic whenever a profit could be made by it.    From the beginning of his connection with this case Roswell Field  contended for the broad principle enunciated by Lord Mansfield that  \"Slavery is so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it but  positive law.\" He consented to a discontinuance of the original action  because of the variance of the complaint from the subsequently  discovered facts. In the second suit Dred Scott and his family were  declared free by the local court, but the judgment was reversed on  appeal to the Supreme Court of the state. Judge Gamble, in dissenting  from the opinion of the majority of the Court, held that \"In Missouri  it has been recognized from the beginning of the Government as a  correct position in law that a master who takes his slave to reside in  a state or territory where slavery is prohibited thereby emancipates  his slave.\"    The subsequent sale of Dred Scott to a citizen of New York named  Sandford afforded Roswell Field the opportunity to renew the fight for  Scott's freedom in the United States Circuit Court at St. Louis. The  case was tried in May, 1854, and it was again declared that Scott and  his family \"were negro slaves, the lawful property of Sandford.\"  Roswell Field immediately appealed by writ of error to the Supreme  Court of the United States, where the appeal was first argued early in  1856, and a second time in December of the same year. Mr. Field's  connection with the case ended when he prepared the papers on appeal  and sent his brief to Montgomery Blair, with whom was associated for  Scott on the second hearing George Ticknor Curtis. Both of these  eminent lawyers emulated the example of Eugene Field's father, who for  nearly "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12985"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions — Volume 2 (#7)"],[1," e'er invoke        Thy knightly aid in vain.      \"Such--such a gentle knight thou art,    And it is solace to my heart        To have so fair a friend.    No better, sweeter boon I pray    Than thy affection--by the way,        Hast thou a stamp to lend?\"      \"Aye, marry, 'tis my sweet delight    To succor such an honest knight!\"        Sir Thompson straight replied.    Field caught the proffered treasure up,    Then tossing off a stirrup-cup        From out the castle hied.      July 2d, 1885._      [1] In this specimen of Field's privately circulated verse, as in    his letters, his own punctuation and capitalization are followed.    He had a system of his own which, when complicated with the    office style of the News, resulted in most admirable confusion    and inconsistency.    Was ever request for so small a \"boon\" couched in such lordly pomp of  phrase and in such insinuating rhyme?    It was shortly after Field secured this boon that he had his first  opportunity to waste postage stamps on me. With a party of friends I  went up to Mackinac Island to spend a few days. By the first mail that  reached the island after I had registered at the old Island House, I  received a letter bearing in no less than five different colored inks  the following unique superscription:      For that Most Illustrious and Puissant Knight Errant,    _Sir Slosson Thompson_,    Erstwhile of Chicago, but now illumining    _Mackinac Island, Michigan,_      Where, under civic guise, he is accomplishing prodigious slaughter    among the fish that do infest that coast.    It may be taken for granted that the clerks and the hotel guests were  consumed with curiosity as to the contents of an envelope over which  they had a chance to speculate before it reached me. These were:      CHICAGO, July 19th, 1885.      SWEET KNIGHT:      Heedful of the promise I made to thee prior to thy setting out for    the far-distant province of Mackinac, I am minded to temporarily lay    aside the accoutrements of war and the chase, and pen thee this    missive wherein I do discourse of all that has happened since thy    departure. Upon Saturday I did lunch with that ill-tempered knight,    Sir P----, and in the evening did I discuss a goodly feast with Sir    Cowan, than whom a more hospitable knight doth not exist--saving only    and always thyself, which art the paragon of courtesy. This day did I    lunch at my own expense, but in very sooth I had it charged, whereat    did the damned Dutchman sorely lament. Would to God I were now    assured at whose expense I shall lunch upon the morrow and the many    days that must elapse ere thy coming hence.      By this courier I send thee divers rhymes which may divert thee.    Soothly they are most honest chronicles, albeit in all modesty I may    say they do not o'erpraise me.      The good Knight Melville crieth it from the battlements that he will    go into a far country next week. Meanwhile the valorous Sir    Ballantyne saweth wood but sayeth naught. That winsome handmaiden    Birdie quitteth our service a week hence; marry, I shall miss the    wench.      The fair lady Julia doth commend thy prudence in getting out of the    way ere she reproaches thee for seducing the good Knight into that    Milwaukee journey, of the responsibility of which naughtiness I have    in very sooth washed my hands as clean as a sheep's liver.      By what good fortune, too, hast thou escaped the heat and toil of    this irksome weather. By my halidom the valor trickleth down my    knightly chin as I pen these few lines, and my shirt cleaveth to my    back like a porous plaster. The good knight of the Talking Cat    speaketh to me of taking his vacation in the middle of August,    whereat I much grieve, having a mind to hie me away at that sweet    season myself.      One sumptuous feast have we already had at thy expense at Boyle's, as    by the check thou shalt descry on thy return. Sir Harper did send me    a large fish from Lake Okeboji to-day, which the same did I and my    heirdom devour triumphantly this very evening. I have not beheld the    Knight of the Lawn since thy departure. Make fair obeisance to the    sweet ladies who are with thee, and remember me in all courtesy to    Sir Barbour, the good Knight of the Four Winds.      Kissing thy hand a thousand times, I sign myself    Thy loyal and sweet servant,      FIELD,    The Good and Honest Knight.    Under another cover addressed ostentatiously:    \"For the Good and Generous Knight, Sir Slosson Thompson, now summering  amid rejoicings and with triumphant cheer at Mackinac Island, Michigan,\"    came the following poem, entitled:      _THE GOOD SIR SLOSSON'S EPISODE WITH THE GARRULOUS SIR BARBOUR      Sir Slosson and companions three--    With hearts that reeked with careless glee--        Strode down the golden sand,    And pausing on the pebbly shore,    They heard the sullen, solemn roar        Of surf on every hand.      Then Lady Florence said \"I ween\"--    \"Nay, 'tis not half so grand a scene,\"        Sir Barbour quickly cried,    \"As you may see in my fair state,    Where swings the well-greased golden gate        Above the foamy tide.\"      Sir Slosson quoth, \"In very sooth\"--    \"Nay, say not so, impetuous youth,\"        Sir Barbour made his boast:    \"This northern breeze will not compare    With that delicious perfumed air        Which broods upon our coast.\"      Then Lady Helen fain would say    Her word, but in his restless way        Sir Barbour nipped that word;    The other three were dumb perforce--    Except Sir Barbour's glib discourse,        No human sound was heard.      And even that majestic roar    Of breakers on the northern shore        Sank to a murmur low;    The winds recoiled and cried, \"I' sooth,    Until we heard this 'Frisco youth,        We reckoned we could blow!\"      Sir Slosson paled with pent-up ire--    His eyes emitted fitful fire--        With rage his blood congealed;    Yet, exercising sweet restraint,    He swore no vow and breathed no plaint--        But pined for Good Old Field.      The ladies, too, we dare to say,    (If they survived that fateful day),        Eschew all 'Frisco men,    Who, as perchance you have inferred,    Won't let a person get a word        In edgewise now and then._    The subject of the good-natured and clever satire was our mutual  friend, Barbour Lathrop, with whom I had been associated in journalism  in San Francisco and who is famous from the Bohemian Club literally  around the globe and in many of its most out-of-the-way islands as a  most entertaining, albeit incessant, story-teller and conversationalist.  Pretty nearly all subjects that interest humanity have engaged his  attention. He could no more rest from travel than Ulysses; and he  brought to those he associated with all the fruits that faring forth  in strange lands could give to a mind singularly alert for education  and experience under any and all conditions. His fondness for  monologue frequently exposed him to raillery, like the above, in the  column where Field daily held a monopoly of table talk.    But the episode with the \"Garrulous Sir Barbour\" was not the rhyme of  chief interest (to Field and me) forwarded by \"this courier.\"    This was confided to a third envelope even more elaborately addressed  and embellished than either of the others, as follows:      For the valorous, joyous, Triumphant and Glorious Knight,    The ever gentle and Courteous Flower of Chivalry,    Cream of Knight Errantry and Pole Star of Manly virtues,    _Sir Slosson Thompson_,    who doth for the nonce sojourn at    _Mackinac Island, Michigan_,      Where under the guise of a lone Fisherman he is    regaled with sumptuous   cheer and divers rejoicings,    wherein he doth right merrily disport.    The rhyme under this cover in which the impecunious knight did not  \"overpraise\" himself bore the title \"How the Good Knight protected Sir  Slosson's Credit,\" and was well calculated to fill me with forebodings.  It ran in this wise:      _One midnight hour, Sir Ballantyne    Addressed Old Field: \"Good comrade mine,          The times i' faith are drear;    Since you have not a son to spend    I would to God our generous friend          Sir Slosson now were here!\"      Then spake the Impecunious Knight,    Regardful of his piteous plight:          \"Odds bobs, you say the truth;    For since our friend has gone away,    It doth devolve on thee to pay--          Else would I starve i' sooth.\"      Emerging from their lofty lair    This much bereaved but worthy pair          Proceeded unto Boyle's,    Agreed that buttered toast would do.    Although they were accustomed to          The choicest roasts and broils.      \"Heyday, sir knights,\" a varlet cried    ('Twas Charlie, famous far and wide          As Boyle's devoted squire);    \"Sir Slosson telegraphs me to    Deliver straightway unto you          Whatever you desire.\"      The knights with radiant features saw    The message dated Mackinaw--          Then ordered sumptuous cheer;    Two dollars' worth, at least, they \"cheered\"    While from his counter Charlie leered          An instigating leer.      I wot poor Charlie did not dream    The telegram was but a scheme          To mulct Sir Slosson's pelf;    For in the absence of his friend    The Honest Knight made bold to send          That telegram himself.      Oh, honest Field I to keep aright    The credit of an absent Knight--          And undefiled his name!    Upon such service for thy friends    Such knightly courtesies depends          Thy everlasting fame!_    Two days later I received a postal written in a disguised hand by  Ballantyne, I think, and purporting to come from \"Charlie,\" showing  the progress of the conspiracy to mulct Sir Slosson's pelf. It read:      FRIEND THOMPSON,      Fields and Ballantyne gave me the telegram tonight ordering one    supper. But they have been eating all the week at your expense. Is    it"]]]
