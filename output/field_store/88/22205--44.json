It will be nurtured and  well looked after, and the one regret will be that it does not bring  in an annual income in proportion to the original amount.    [Illustration: PRESIDENT KRUGER.]    The Boer's politics are summed up in the single word 'Defence.' He is  not aggressive, but he is strong on Defence. Possession with him is  ten points of the law--it is everything. Let the independence of his  country be threatened, and he is at once a man of action. He  figuratively converts his ploughshare into a sword, although the uses  of that weapon are unknown to him. At the time of the Jameson Raid it  may safely be asserted that there did not exist a single Boer--young  or old--who was not in possession of a serviceable firearm and the  full complement of ammunition. The Kantoors--i.e., the Government  offices--were daily besieged by eager men as eager to possess  themselves of the instruments and munitions of war. Every man was  ready; farmers were no longer farmers, but soldiers, prepared to face  the worst in the defence of their only love--their country.          CHAPTER VI      The Boer is not what one would call a sentimental person; he is  practical in all his ways. If he sees a thunderstorm approaching, he  does not go into raptures over the magnificence of the lightning; he  watches that thunderstorm calmly and philosophically. And if he had  anything to do with the order of the elements, he would have that  thunderstorm come his way, and he would detain it exactly three days  over his particular farm, so that the rain should leave a lasting  impression upon his mealies and forage. The Boer likes wet weather,  probably because he gets so little of it.    I have said that the Boer is practical in all things; he is even so in  love. The old story concerning the 'opzit' candle may have applied in  former days, but the Boer of the present day does not waste his time  in any such fashion. He has probably become cognisant of the  match-making methods practised by other nations, and he has,  therefore, abandoned that affected by his forefathers. It is still a  common thing, however, to see him astride a horse with a sleek skin  and noble appearance and plenty of life in it, cantering gaily towards  the residence of his beloved or intended. Sometimes, too, in order,  perhaps, to add more lustre to his own appearance, he is to be seen  suffering untold agony under the unyielding brim of a tall, white felt  hat, trimmed with green veiling. He likes to look imposing, and so he  gets under that hat. This in many instances may account for the  restiveness of his steed, which is as yet unaccustomed to the weight  of a person with such a grotesque headgear.    The Boer has several methods of courting. There is one thing he  objects very strongly to, however--he doesn't like courting in a  drawing-room; he prefers a dark and quiet corner on the veranda. Let  us picture a little scene in this connection. Observe young Piet,  dressed in his best Sunday suit, and wearing a worried look in  addition, sitting on one end of a long form that stands on the veranda  of the house; and observe also a fair young damsel, who has just been  initiated into the art of doing her hair up on top, sitting on the  other extreme end of that form. The night may be dark and only the  stars visible, or the moon may be shining brightly overhead, casting  shadows awry here and there, and endeavouring to catch a furtive  glimpse of the lovers under cover of the veranda.    A painful silence takes the place of conversation at the outset, and  young Piet occasionally coughs in an apologetic manner. When he does  sum up sufficient courage, the moon has travelled a considerable  distance; but then Piet is not so sentimental as to make any reference  whatever to the moon.    'That's a fine horse your father has bought of Dirk Odendaal,' says  Piet, in a tone which suggests that his new paper collar, purchased  for the occasion, is choking him.    A two minutes' pause ensues.    'Ja! Piet,' agreeably assents the maiden after an interval which Piet  reckons must be at least half an hour--and he has forgotten about the  new horse altogether.    'Your father's oxen are looking well after the rain,' continues Piet  some minutes later; and this time he has reduced the space between  himself and the maiden by about three inches.    After the lapse of another few minutes, the maiden, who is evidently  bashful, ventures again, 'Ja! Piet.'    Piet's eyes wander away across the open veldt in front of him, and  gradually from the observation of kopjes, they wander upwards towards  the pale moon; but, as has already been remarked, that luminary  suggests no new theme in the mind of Piet.    'The last Nachtmaal was very good.'    With this he once more edges away from his end of the form and covers  an additional three inches.    'Ja! Piet.'    Another person would have become exasperated at this stage, but not so  Piet.    'The new minister preaches very well,' is followed up by an advance of  three more inches.    'Ja, Piet!'    The form may be an inconveniently long one, and this naturally hampers  Piet somewhat, because by the time he has covered half the distance,  his stock of remarks may be exhausted. But he gets close up in time,  by the exercise of perseverance, and when he is at last in a position  to manipulate his left arm in connection with the maiden's waist, he  does so with a sigh of relief.    'I think I love you a great deal,' is what he says when he has placed  his arm to his satisfaction. The maiden whispers 'Ja, Piet!' and the  thing is done.    But the young Boer does not attach so much importance to pleasant  features and agreeable dispositions, as he does to the worldly  standing of the lady's parents. If there is the slightest prospect of  a handsome dowry in the shape of one or two farms, the inducement to  enter into married bliss is, of course, greater than in the case of  the young lady who merely brings with her a nice set of false teeth  and a pleasant countenance. Young widows are in great demand  throughout the country, because, as a rule, they are in possession of  farms and stock which require the undivided attention of a responsible  man, and that man must be a husband.    Such an instance occurred only the other day. This very fortunate  young man, before his betrothal, could conveniently count his riches  on the fingers of his left hand--in pence! But he is happy now,  because he can bring in a load of wool every year with his own waggon  and oxen, and talk to the merchant with all the swagger and assurance  of a full-blown capitalist.    It must not be supposed that such occurrences are uncommon; they  happen almost every week, which would seem to indicate that rich young  widows are very plentiful.    In these latter days a Boer wedding is arranged on a very grand scale.  No matter if the young couple reside fifty miles from the nearest  town, they all come in to church to get fixed up. Friends and  relations arrive, with great ostentation, in conveyances drawn by  four, six, and sometimes eight, horses, the number depending on the  wealth of the families. They come from far and near. You can see them  coming to town when they are yet miles away across the veldt--that is,  if the day is bright. The dresses of the women-folks flash gaily in  the sun, and the old vrouw would not change places with the Queen of  Holland as she proudly surveys her offspring seated around her in the  wagonette. The old man presides unctuously at the ribbons, and he  cracks his whip every now and then just to let his team know that he  is there, and that he is a very capable person.    [Illustration: DUTCH CHURCH (PRETORIA)]    The generality of weddings are uninteresting, but occasionally  something unique is introduced. In the town of Harrismith a very long  time ago, a transport-rider decided to take unto himself a fair  partner. He was a practical sort of person, and in cases of this kind  he did not believe in allowing business to become a secondary  consideration. Transport-riding in those days paid very handsomely,  and the intervention of side issues might have meant a serious loss.  Accordingly, this particular gentleman (who had meantime been loading  up coal) repaired to his tent-waggon at the appointed hour, and  proceeded to attire himself in the conventional black suit. In order  to economize time, he pulled his best clothes over his working  garments, and hastily rubbing his face and hands with a coarse towel,  he hurried towards the church. Within ten minutes he was back again  loading up coal, his better half being occupied in preparing dinner.    The Dutch are not a musical nation, and for convincing proof it is  only necessary to attend Divine service in any of their churches.  Their rendition of psalm-tunes reminds me of A.K.H.B.'s story  regarding the lonely Italian, who, passing the Iron Church in  Edinburgh one Sunday morning while the congregation were engaged in  praise, and on inquiring of the beadle 'What that horrible noise was?'  remarked very sorrowfully, 'Then their God must have no ear for  music' It is strange, nevertheless, that no matter how poor a Boer may  be, he will have an organ in his house. There are instances  innumerable where the only respectable piece of furniture in the house  is an organ. It does not, of course, follow that every Boer is a  musician, but it is a fact that nearly every Boer knows how to produce  at least one tune, even if it is only the Volkslied or national  anthem. They will come into the stores, and the first thing they do is  to sit down at an organ and show people generally what they can do. In  the meantime the English merchant and his clerks fume around and vow  all sorts of things under their breath, but the indefatigable Boer  knows nothing of all this, and he would not care if he did.          CHAPTER VII      Besides the everlasting worry of keeping"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1557"],[0,"Men of Iron (#7)"],[1,"le, wilt thou?\"    Myles made no answer. He flung down his sheepskin and sat him gloomily  down upon the side of the cot.    \"I said that I would sooner die than fetch water for them,\" said he.    \"Aye, aye,\" said Gascoyne; \"but that was spoken in haste.\"    Myles said nothing, but shook his head.    But, after all, circumstances shape themselves. The next morning when he  rose up through the dark waters of sleep it was to feel some one shaking  him violently by the shoulder.    \"Come!\" cried Gascoyne, as Myles opened his eyes--\"come, time passeth,  and we are late.\"    Myles, bewildered with his sudden awakening, and still fuddled with the  fumes of sleep, huddled into his doublet and hose, hardly knowing what  he was doing; tying a point here and a point there, and slipping  his feet into his shoes. Then he hurried after Gascoyne, frowzy,  half-dressed, and even yet only half-awake. It was not until he was  fairly out into the fresh air and saw Gascoyne filling the three  leathern buckets at the tank, that he fully awakened to the fact that he  was actually doing that hateful service for the bachelors which he had  protested he would sooner die than render.    The sun was just rising, gilding the crown of the donjon-keep with a  flame of ruddy light. Below, among the lesser buildings, the day was  still gray and misty. Only an occasional noise broke the silence of the  early morning: a cough from one of the rooms; the rattle of a pot or  a pan, stirred by some sleepy scullion; the clapping of a door or a  shutter, and now and then the crowing of a cock back of the long row of  stables--all sounding loud and startling in the fresh dewy stillness.    \"Thou hast betrayed me,\" said Myles, harshly, breaking the silence at  last. \"I knew not what I was doing, or else I would never have come  hither. Ne'theless, even though I be come, I will not carry the water  for them.\"    \"So be it,\" said Gascoyne, tartly. \"An thou canst not stomach it,  let be, and I will e'en carry all three myself. It will make me two  journeys, but, thank Heaven, I am not so proud as to wish to get me  hard knocks for naught.\" So saying, he picked up two of the buckets and  started away across the court for the dormitory.    Then Myles, with a lowering face, snatched up the third, and, hurrying  after, gave him his hand with the extra pail. So it was that he came to  do service, after all.    \"Why tarried ye so long?\" said one of the older bachelors, roughly, as  the two lads emptied the water into the wooden trough. He sat on the  edge of the cot, blowzed and untrussed, with his long hair tumbled and  disordered.    His dictatorial tone stung Myles to fury. \"We tarried no longer than  need be,\" answered he, savagely. \"Have we wings to fly withal at your  bidding?\"    He spoke so loudly that all in the room heard him; the younger squires  who were dressing stared in blank amazement, and Blunt sat up suddenly  in his cot.    \"Why, how now?\" he cried. \"Answerest thou back thy betters so pertly,  sirrah? By my soul, I have a mind to crack thy head with this clog for  thy unruly talk.\"    He glared at Myles as he spoke, and Myles glared back again with right  good-will. Matters might have come to a crisis, only that Gascoyne and  Wilkes dragged their friend away before he had opportunity to answer.    \"An ill-conditioned knave as ever I did see,\" growled Blunt, glaring  after him.    \"Myles, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, almost despairingly, \"why wilt thou  breed such mischief for thyself? Seest thou not thou hast got thee  the ill-will of every one of the bachelors, from Wat Blunt to Robin de  Ramsey?\"    \"I care not,\" said Myles, fiercely, recurring to his grievance. \"Heard  ye not how the dogs upbraided me before the whole room? That Blunt  called me an ill-conditioned knave.\"    \"Marry!\" said Gascoyne, laughing, \"and so thou art.\"    Thus it is that boldness may breed one enemies as well as gain one  friends. My own notion is that one's enemies are more quick to act than  one's friends.        CHAPTER 8    Every one knows the disagreeable, lurking discomfort that follows a  quarrel--a discomfort that imbitters the very taste of life for the time  being. Such was the dull distaste that Myles felt that morning after  what had passed in the dormitory. Every one in the proximity of such  an open quarrel feels a reflected constraint, and in Myles's mind was a  disagreeable doubt whether that constraint meant disapproval of him or  of his late enemies.    It seemed to him that Gascoyne added the last bitter twang to his  unpleasant feelings when, half an hour later, they marched with the  others to chapel.    \"Why dost thou breed such trouble for thyself, Myles?\" said he,  recurring to what he had already said. \"Is it not foolish for thee to  come hither to this place, and then not submit to the ways thereof, as  the rest of us do?\"    \"Thou talkest not like a true friend to chide me thus,\" said Myles,  sullenly; and he withdrew his arm from his friend's.    \"Marry, come up!\" said Gascoyne; \"an I were not thy friend, I would let  thee jog thine own way. It aches not my bones to have thine drubbed.\"    Just then they entered the chapel, and words that might have led to a  quarrel were brought to a close.    Myles was not slow to see that he had the ill will of the head of their  company. That morning in the armory he had occasion to ask some question  of Blunt; the head squire stared coldly at him for a moment, gave him a  short, gruff answer, and then, turning his back abruptly, began talking  with one of the other bachelors. Myles flushed hot at the other's  insulting manner, and looked quickly around to see if any of the others  had observed what had passed. It was a comfort to him to see that all  were too busy arming themselves to think of anything else; nevertheless,  his face was very lowering as he turned away.    \"Some day I will show him that I am as good a man as he,\" he muttered to  himself. \"An evil-hearted dog to put shame upon me!\"    The storm was brewing and ready to break.      That day was exceptionally hot and close, and permission had been asked  by and granted to those squires not on duty to go down to the river for  a bath after exercise at the pels. But as Myles replaced his arms in  the rack, a little page came with a bidding to come to Sir James in his  office.    \"Look now,\" said Myles, \"here is just my ill-fortune. Why might he not  have waited an hour longer rather than cause me to miss going with ye?\"    \"Nay,\" said Gascoyne, \"let not that grieve thee, Myles. Wilkes and I  will wait for thee in the dormitory--will we not, Edmund? Make thou  haste and go to Sir James.\"    Sir James was sitting at the table studying over a scroll of parchment,  when Myles entered his office and stood before him at the table.    \"Well, boy,\" said he, laying aside the parchment and looking up at the  lad, \"I have tried thee fairly for these few days, and may say that I  have found thee worthy to be entered upon the rolls as esquire of the  body.\"    \"I give thee thanks, sir,\" said Myles.    The knight nodded his head in acknowledgement, but did not at once give  the word of dismissal that Myles had expected. \"Dost mean to write thee  a letter home soon?\" said he, suddenly.    \"Aye,\" said Myles, gaping in great wonderment at the strangeness of the  question.    \"Then when thou dost so write,\" said Sir James, \"give thou my deep  regards to thy father.\" Then he continued, after a brief pause. \"Him did  I know well in times gone by, and we were right true friends in hearty  love, and for his sake I would befriend thee--that is, in so much as is  fitting.\"    \"Sir,\" said Myles; but Sir James held up his hand, and he stopped short  in his thanks.    \"But, boy,\" said he, \"that which I sent for thee for to tell thee was of  more import than these. Dost thou know that thy father is an attainted  outlaw?\"    \"Nay,\" cried Myles, his cheeks blazing up as red as fire; \"who sayeth  that of him lieth in his teeth.\"    \"Thou dost mistake me,\" said Sir James, quietly. \"It is sometimes no  shame to be outlawed and banned. Had it been so, I would not have told  thee thereof, nor have bidden thee send my true love to thy father, as  I did but now. But, boy, certes he standest continually in great  danger--greater than thou wottest of. Were it known where he lieth hid,  it might be to his undoing and utter ruin. Methought that belike thou  mightest not know that; and so I sent for thee for to tell thee that it  behoovest thee to say not one single word concerning him to any of these  new friends of thine, nor who he is, nor what he is.\"    \"But how came my father to be so banned?\" said Myles, in a constrained  and husky voice, and after a long time of silence.    \"That I may not tell thee just now,\" said the old knight, \"only  this--that I have been bidden to make it known to thee that thy father  hath an enemy full as powerful as my Lord the Earl himself, and  that through that enemy all his ill-fortune--his blindness and  everything--hath come. Moreover, did this enemy know where thy father  lieth, he would slay him right speedily.\"    \"Sir,\" cried Myles, violently smiting his open palm upon the table,  \"tell me who this man is, and I will kill him!\"    Sir James smiled grimly. \"Thou talkest like a boy,\" said he. \"Wait until  thou art grown to be a man. Mayhap then thou mayst repent thee of these  bold words, for one time this enemy of thy father's was reckoned the  foremost knight in England, and he is now the King's dear friend and a  great lord.\"    \"But,\" said Myles, after another long time of heavy silence, \"will not  my Lord then befriend me for the sake of my father, who was one time his  dear comrade?\"    Sir James shook his head. \"It may not be,\" said he. \"Neither thou nor  thy father must look for open favor from the Earl. An he befriended  Falworth, and it came to be known that he had given him aid or succor,  it might belike be to his own undoing. No,"]]]
