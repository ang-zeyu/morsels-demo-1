He invited Lambert  Bernardi and his sons to decorate the whole of the vaulting of the  cathedral. This they did by covering it with beautifully painted  designs. But unfortunately, excepting the small remnant now on the  vault in the lady-chapel (see page 92), their work was entirely  destroyed early in the nineteenth century. Some idea of its original  beauty may be formed by an examination of similar work by other hands  that may yet be seen in S. Anastasia at Verona, in two churches at  Liege, and at S. Albans Abbey. An engraving by T. King, of about 1814,  shows some details of the design that was painted on the vault of the  choir in the bay next but one to the central tower. The cathedral was  at this time an open book, with its walls covered with painted  stories. The reredos, the stalls of the canons, as well as the walls,  were rich with colour. Now all has gone except a meagre, faded scrap  under the arch from the present library into the transept, and one or  two other slight remnants. Sherburne also had some large pictures  painted by the Bernardis. They represented the kings of England and  the bishops of Chichester, and used to hang upon the west and east  walls of the south transept.    From Sherburne's death until the seventeenth century little but a tale  of destruction is to be recorded; for this period witnessed the  dissolution of the monasteries, the beginning of a wholesale system of  spoliation urged by self-interest and hypocrisy, and the establishment  of \"Reformation\" methods of procedure in Church and State. By each of  these both the fabric and the diocese suffered, even though by some  they gained. But especially did vandalism help to destroy,  unnecessarily, many things which, legitimately used, might still have  been allowed to remain as evidences of the artistic influence of the  Church in England. For though some of them were dedicated to uses  which the reformation necessarily condemned the wholesale destruction  of much beautiful workmanship must be regretted by any who are  interested in such treasures. In 1538 it was ordered that all shrines  should be abolished. This seriously affected Chichester, as the fate  of the feretory of S. Richard was involved by the mandate. Two  commissioners were named, whose duty was to see that his shrine was  removed. The instructions issued served a double purpose, since in  this case, as in others, \"reformation\" helped to satisfy the claims of  avarice. Henry told the commissioners that         \"We, wylyng such superstitious abuses and idolatries to be       taken away, command you with all convenient diligence to       repayre unto the said cathedral church of Chichester and       there to take down that shrine and bones of that bishop       called S. Richard within the same, with all the sylver,       gold, juells, and ornamentes aforesaid, to be safely and       surely conveighed and brought unto our Tower of London,       there to be bestowed as we shall further determine at your       arrival. And also that ye shall see bothe the place where       the same shryne standyth to be raysed and defaced even to       the very ground, and all such other images of the church as       any notable superstition hath been used to be taken and       conveyed away.\" [16]      [16] Walcott, p. 34.    Then in 1550         \"there were letters sent to every bishop to pluck down the       altars, in lieu of them to set up a table in some convenient       place of the chancel within every church or chapel to serve       for the ministration of the Blessed Communion.\"    Bishop Daye replied that         \"he could not conform his conscience to do what he was by       the said letter commanded.\"    In explanation of his attitude towards this order he wrote that         \"he stycked not att the form, situation, or matter [_as       stone or wood_] whereof the altar was made, but I then toke,       as I now take, those things to be indifferent.... But the       commandment which was given to me to take downe all altars       within my diocese, and in lieu of them 'to sett up a table'       implying in itselffe [_as I take it_] a playne abolyshment       of the altare [_both the name and the things_] from the use       and ministration of the Holy Communion, I could not with my       conscience then execute.\"    The churches were so ransacked and destroyed in this way that Bishop  Harsnett [17] said he found the cathedral and the buildings about the  close had been criminally neglected for years, so that they were in a  decayed and almost ruinous condition. Such was the deliberate opinion  which he expressed early in the seventeenth century.      [17] \"Records.\"    During the first half of the sixteenth century a stone parapet, or  screen wall (taken away in 1829), was built up in front of the  triforium arcade. It rose to a height of about four feet six inches,  and was continued throughout the whole length of the church. It has  been supposed that it was intended to render this gallery available as  a place from which some of the congregation might observe the great  ceremonials. So we see that after the close of the fifteenth century  little but decline is to be recorded. Since Sherburne's day no care  had been taken of the fabric; and except that an organ was introduced  above the Arundel screen, no new schemes were devised, no new building  done. It should be remembered, however, that the Reformation did not  at once destroy all the beauties of mediaeval art that the cathedral  contained. Certain things, such as shrines, altars, chantries, and  chapels, were removed, dismantled, or totally wrecked. It was with the  coming of the Parliamentary army to the city that wholesale pillage  and destruction began.    The removal of the altar and other derangements of the building had  been effected during the preceding century; but now the vestments,  plate, and ornaments were stolen. The decorative and other paintings  on the walls, and all parts that could easily be reached, were  scratched, scraped, and hacked about until they were mere wretched,  disfiguring excrescences; and in this mutilated condition they waited  for the whitewash that came later, to cover up these vulgar excesses  with a cheap but clean decency. Such criminal procedure culminated in  the wilful wreckage of all the beautiful glass. The store of three  centuries of labour and consummate skill was destroyed till it lay all  strewn in broken fragments, mere rubbish, about the floors. But the  decorations on the vaults were saved, because they could not be  reached without expensive scaffolding. They were thus preserved to be  dealt with by the wisdom and taste of a later century.    Let me quote the remarks of one who lived when these things were done.  He says they         \"plundered the Cathedral, seized upon the vestments and       ornaments of the Church, together with the consecrated plate       serving for the altar; they left not so much as a cushion       for the pulpit, nor a chalice for the Blessed Sacraments;       the common soldiers brake down the organs, and dashing the       pipes with their pole-axes, scoffingly said, 'hark how the       organs go!' They brake the rail, which was done with that       fury that the Table itself escaped not their madness. They       forced open all the locks, whether of doors or desks,       wherein the singing men laid up their common prayer books,       their singing books, their gowns and surplices; they rent       the books in pieces, and scattered the torn leaves all over       the church even to the covering of the pavement, the gowns       and surplices they reserved to secular uses. In the south       cross ile the history of the church's foundation, the       picture of the Kings of England, and the picture of the       bishops of Selsey and Chichester, begun by Robert Sherborn       the 37th Bishop of that see, they defaced and mangled with       their hands and swords as high as they could reach. On the       Tuesday following, after the sermon, possessed and       transported by a bacchanalian fury, they ran up and down the       church with their swords drawn, defacing the monuments of       the dead, hacking and hewing the seats and stalls, and       scraping the painted walls. Sir William Waller and the rest       of the commanders standby as spectators and approvers of       these barbarous impieties.\" [18]      [18] \"Mercurius Rusticus\" (1642). Quoted by Walcott.    This is a history in little of what took place in nearly every  cathedral and other church in the kingdom, and this after the  Reformation and its best work had been a fact for a century.    The most important disaster to the fabric during the seventeenth  century was that which so seriously affected the structure at the west  end. It is difficult to decide exactly when and how north-west tower  fell or was removed. Professor Willis [19] is content to say:         \"Mr. Butler informs me that there is evidence to show that       the north tower was taken down by the advice of Sir       Christopher Wren, on account of its ruinous condition.\"      [19] \"Archaeological History,\" Chichester, p. 6, note _c_.    But Praecentor Ede, in a paper written about 1684 A.D. and quoted by  Praecentor Walcott, [20] gives         \"an account of Dr. Christopher Wren's opinion concerning the       rebuilding of one of the great towers at the west end of the       Cathedral Church of Chichester, one third part of which,       from top to bottom, fell down above fifty years since, which       he gave after he had for about two hours viewed it both       without and within, and above and below, and had also       observed the great want of repairs, especially in the inside       of the other great west tower, and having well surveyed the       whole of the west end of the said Church, which was in       substance as followeth; that there could be no secure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13334"],[0,"The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce — Volume 2: In the Midst of Life: Tales of (#7)"],[1,"in the  wall and hedge. He means, if not killed, to ride through and overlook  the country beyond.    You are not to forget the nature of this man's act; it is not permitted  to you to think of it as an instance of bravado, nor, on the other hand,  a needless sacrifice of self. If the enemy has not retreated he is in  force on that ridge. The investigator will encounter nothing less than a  line-of-battle; there is no need of pickets, videttes, skirmishers, to  give warning of our approach; our attacking lines will be visible,  conspicuous, exposed to an artillery fire that will shave the ground the  moment they break from cover, and for half the distance to a sheet of  rifle bullets in which nothing can live. In short, if the enemy is  there, it would be madness to attack him in front; he must be manoeuvred  out by the immemorial plan of threatening his line of communication, as  necessary to his existence as to the diver at the bottom of the sea his  air tube. But how ascertain if the enemy is there? There is but one  way,--somebody must go and see. The natural and customary thing to do is  to send forward a line of skirmishers. But in this case they will answer  in the affirmative with all their lives; the enemy, crouching in double  ranks behind the stone wall and in cover of the hedge, will wait until  it is possible to count each assailant's teeth. At the first volley a  half of the questioning line will fall, the other half before it can  accomplish the predestined retreat. What a price to pay for gratified  curiosity! At what a dear rate an army must sometimes purchase  knowledge! \"Let me pay all,\" says this gallant man--this military  Christ!    There is no hope except the hope against hope that the crest is clear.  True, he might prefer capture to death. So long as he advances, the line  will not fire--why should it? He can safely ride into the hostile ranks  and become a prisoner of war. But this would defeat his object. It would  not answer our question; it is necessary either that he return unharmed  or be shot to death before our eyes. Only so shall we know how to act.  If captured--why, that might have been done by a half-dozen stragglers.    Now begins an extraordinary contest of intellect between a man and an  army. Our horseman, now within a quarter of a mile of the crest,  suddenly wheels to the left and gallops in a direction parallel to it.  He has caught sight of his antagonist; he knows all. Some slight  advantage of ground has enabled him to overlook a part of the line. If  he were here he could tell us in words. But that is now hopeless; he  must make the best use of the few minutes of life remaining to him, by  compelling the enemy himself to tell us as much and as plainly as  possible--which, naturally, that discreet power is reluctant to do. Not  a rifleman in those crouching ranks, not a cannoneer at those masked and  shotted guns, but knows the needs of the situation, the imperative duty  of forbearance. Besides, there has been time enough to forbid them all  to fire. True, a single rifle-shot might drop him and be no great  disclosure. But firing is infectious--and see how rapidly he moves, with  never a pause except as he whirls his horse about to take a new  direction, never directly backward toward us, never directly forward  toward his executioners. All this is visible through the glass; it seems  occurring within pistol-shot; we see all but the enemy, whose presence,  whose thoughts, whose motives we infer. To the unaided eye there is  nothing but a black figure on a white horse, tracing slow zigzags  against the slope of a distant hill--so slowly they seem almost to  creep.    Now--the glass again--he has tired of his failure, or sees his error, or  has gone mad; he is dashing directly forward at the wall, as if to take  it at a leap, hedge and all! One moment only and he wheels right about  and is speeding like the wind straight down the slope--toward his  friends, toward his death! Instantly the wall is topped with a fierce  roll of smoke for a distance of hundreds of yards to right and left.  This is as instantly dissipated by the wind, and before the rattle of  the rifles reaches us he is down. No, he recovers his seat; he has but  pulled his horse upon its haunches. They are up and away! A tremendous  cheer bursts from our ranks, relieving the insupportable tension of our  feelings. And the horse and its rider? Yes, they are up and away. Away,  indeed--they are making directly to our left, parallel to the now  steadily blazing and smoking wall. The rattle of the musketry is  continuous, and every bullet's target is that courageous heart.    Suddenly a great bank of white smoke pushes upward from behind the wall.  Another and another--a dozen roll up before the thunder of the  explosions and the humming of the missiles reach our ears and the  missiles themselves come bounding through clouds of dust into our  covert, knocking over here and there a man and causing a temporary  distraction, a passing thought of self.    The dust drifts away. Incredible!--that enchanted horse and rider have  passed a ravine and are climbing another slope to unveil another  conspiracy of silence, to thwart the will of another armed host. Another  moment and that crest too is in eruption. The horse rears and strikes  the air with its forefeet. They are down at last. But look again--the  man has detached himself from the dead animal. He stands erect,  motionless, holding his sabre in his right hand straight above his head.  His face is toward us. Now he lowers his hand to a level with his face  and moves it outward, the blade of the sabre describing a downward  curve. It is a sign to us, to the world, to posterity. It is a hero's  salute to death and history.    Again the spell is broken; our men attempt to cheer; they are choking  with emotion; they utter hoarse, discordant cries; they clutch their  weapons and press tumultuously forward into the open. The skirmishers,  without orders, against orders, are going forward at a keen run, like  hounds unleashed. Our cannon speak and the enemy's now open in full  chorus; to right and left as far as we can see, the distant crest,  seeming now so near, erects its towers of cloud and the great shot pitch  roaring down among our moving masses. Flag after flag of ours emerges  from the wood, line after line sweeps forth, catching the sunlight on  its burnished arms. The rear battalions alone are in obedience; they  preserve their proper distance from the insurgent front.    The commander has not moved. He now removes his field-glass from his  eyes and glances to the right and left. He sees the human current  flowing on either side of him and his huddled escort, like tide waves  parted by a rock. Not a sign of feeling in his face; he is thinking.  Again he directs his eyes forward; they slowly traverse that malign and  awful crest. He addresses a calm word to his bugler. _Tra-la-la!  Tra-la-la!_ The injunction has an imperiousness which enforces it. It is  repeated by all the bugles of all the sub-ordinate commanders; the sharp  metallic notes assert themselves above the hum of the advance and  penetrate the sound of the cannon. To halt is to withdraw. The colors  move slowly back; the lines face about and sullenly follow, bearing  their wounded; the skirmishers return, gathering up the dead.    Ah, those many, many needless dead! That great soul whose beautiful body  is lying over yonder, so conspicuous against the sere hillside--could it  not have been spared the bitter consciousness of a vain devotion? Would  one exception have marred too much the pitiless perfection of the  divine, eternal plan?          ONE OF THE MISSING    Jerome Searing, a private soldier of General Sherman's army, then  confronting the enemy at and about Kennesaw Mountain, Georgia, turned  his back upon a small group of officers with whom he had been talking in  low tones, stepped across a light line of earthworks, and disappeared in  a forest. None of the men in line behind the works had said a word to  him, nor had he so much as nodded to them in passing, but all who saw  understood that this brave man had been intrusted with some perilous  duty. Jerome Searing, though a private, did not serve in the ranks; he  was detailed for service at division headquarters, being borne upon the  rolls as an orderly. \"Orderly\" is a word covering a multitude of duties.  An orderly may be a messenger, a clerk, an officer's servant--anything.  He may perform services for which no provision is made in orders and  army regulations. Their nature may depend upon his aptitude, upon favor,  upon accident. Private Searing, an incomparable marksman, young, hardy,  intelligent and insensible to fear, was a scout. The general commanding  his division was not content to obey orders blindly without knowing what  was in his front, even when his command was not on detached service, but  formed a fraction of the line of the army; nor was he satisfied to  receive his knowledge of his _vis-a-vis_ through the customary channels;  he wanted to know more than he was apprised of by the corps commander  and the collisions of pickets and skirmishers. Hence Jerome Searing,  with his extraordinary daring, his woodcraft, his sharp eyes, and  truthful tongue. On this occasion his instructions were simple: to get  as near the enemy's lines as possible and learn all that he could.    In a few moments he had arrived at the picket-line, the men on duty  there lying in groups of two and four behind little banks of earth  scooped out of the slight depression in which they lay, their rifles  protruding from the green boughs with which they had masked their small  defenses. The forest extended without a break toward the front, so  solemn and silent that only by an effort of the imagination could it be  conceived as populous with armed men, alert and vigilant--a forest  formidable with possibilities of battle.
