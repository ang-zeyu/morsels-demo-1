There are,  however, more pairs of rollers in the finisher card than there are  in the breaker card, for while the latter is provided with two pairs  of rollers, the former may be arranged with 3, 4, 5 or even 6 pairs  of rollers (6 workers and 6 strippers). The number of pairs of  rollers depends upon the degree of work required, and upon the  opinions of the various managers.    There are two distinct types of finisher cards, viz--             1. Half-circular finisher cards.             2. Full-circular finisher cards.    The machine illustrated in Fig. 15 is of the latter type, and such  machines are so-called because the various pairs of rollers are so  disposed around the cylinder that they occupy almost a complete  circle, and the fibre under treatment must move from pair to pair to  undergo the combing and splitting action before coming into contact  with the doffer. There are five pairs of rollers in the machine in  Fig. 15, and all the rollers are securely boxed in, and the wheels  fenced. The arrangement of the wheels on the gear side is very  similar to that shown in connection with the breaker card in Fig. 14,  and therefore requires no further mention. Outside the boxing comes  the covers, shown clearly at the back of the machine in Fig. 15, and  adapted to be easily and quickly opened when it is desired to  examine the rollers and other parts.    The slivers, after having passed amongst the pins of the various  rollers, and been subjected to the required degree of draft, are  ultimately doffed as a thin film of fibres from the pins of the  cylinder and pass between the drawing rollers to the conductor. The  conductor of a finisher card is made in two widths, so that half the  width of the film enters one section and the other half enters the  other section. These two parallel sheets, split from one common sheet,  traverse the two conductors and are ultimately delivered as two  slivers about 6 inches above the point or plane in which the 10 or 12  slivers entered, and on to what is termed a \"sliver plate.\" The two  slivers are then guided by horns projecting from the upper surface  of the sliver plate, made to travel at right angles to the direction  of delivery from the mouths of the conductors, and then united to  pass as a single sliver between a pair of delivery rollers on the  left of the feed and delivery side and finally into a sliver can.    In special types of finishing cards, an extra piece of  mechanism--termed a draw-head--is employed. The machine illustrated  in Fig. 15 is provided with this extra mechanism which is supported  by the small supplementary frame on the extreme right. This special  mechanism is termed a \"Patent Push Bar Drawing Head,\" and the  function which it performs will be described shortly; in the  meantime it is sufficient to say that it is used only when the  slivers from the finisher card require extra or special treatment. A  very desirable condition in connection with the combination of a  finisher card and a draw-head is that the two distinct parts should  work in unison. In the machine under consideration, the feed and  delivery rollers of the card stop simultaneously with the stoppage  of the draw-head mechanism.    One of the chief aims in spinning is that of producing a uniform  thread; uniform not only in section, but in all other respects. A  so-called level thread refers, in general, to a uniform diameter,  but there are other equally, if not more, important phases connected  with the full sense of the word uniform.    It has already been stated that in the batching department various  qualities of jute are mixed as judiciously as possible in order to  obtain a satisfactory mixture. Fibres of different grades and marks  vary in strength, colour, cleanness, diameter, length and suppleness;  it is of the utmost importance that these fibres of diverse  qualities should be distributed as early as possible in the process  so as to facilitate the subsequent operations.    [Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. James F. Low & Co., Ltd. _  FIG. 16 WASTE TEAZER]    However skilfully the work of mixing the stricks is performed in the  batching department, the degree of uniformity leaves something to be  desired; further improvement is still desirable and indeed necessary.  It need hardly be said, however, that the extent of the improvement,  and the general final result, are influenced greatly by the care  which is exercised in the preliminary processes.    The very fact of uniting 10 or 12 slivers at the feed of the  finisher card mixes 10 or 12 distinct lengths into another new length,  and, in addition, separates in some measure the fibres of each  individual sliver. It must not be taken for granted that the new  length of sliver is identical with each of the individual lengths  and ten or twelve times as bulky. A process of drafting takes place  in the finisher card, so that the fibres which compose the combined  10 or 12 slivers shall be drawn out to a draft of 8 to 16 or even  more; this means that for every yard of the group of slivers which  passes into the machine there is drawn out a length of 8 to 16 yards  or whatever the draft happens to be. The resulting sliver will  therefore be approximately two-thirds the bulk of each of the  original individual slivers. The actual ratio between them will  obviously depend upon the actual draft which is imparted to the  material by the relative velocities of the feed and delivery rollers.    It is only natural to expect that a certain amount of the fibrous  material will escape from the rollers; this forms what is known as  card waste. And in all subsequent machines there is produced, in  spite of all care, a percentage of the amount fed into the machine  which is not delivered as perfect material. All this waste from  various sources, e.g. thread waste, rove waste, card waste, ropes,  dust-shaker waste, etc., is ultimately utilized to produce sliver  for heavy sacking weft.    The dust-shaker, as its name implies, separates the dust from the  valuable fibrous material, and finally all the waste products are  passed through a waste teazer such as that made by Messrs. J. F. Low &  Co., Ltd., Monifieth, and illustrated in Fig. 16. The resulting mass  is then re-carded, perhaps along with other more valuable material,  and made into a sliver which is used, as stated above, in the  production of a cheap and comparatively thick weft such as that used  for sacking.          CHAPTER VIII.  DRAWING AND DRAWING FRAMES    The operations of combing and splitting as performed in both the  breaker and finisher card are obviously due to the circular movement  of the pins since all these (with the single exception of those in  the draw-head mechanism of certain finisher cards) are carried on the  peripheries of rotating rollers. In the draw-head mechanism, the  pins move, while in contact with the fibres, in a rectilinear or  straight path. In the machines which fall to be discussed in this  chapter, viz., the \"drawing frames,\" the action of the pins on the  slivers from the finisher card is also in a straight path; as a  matter of fact, the draw-head of a finisher card is really a small  drawing frame, as its name implies. Moreover, each row or rather  double row, of pins is carried separately by what is termed a  \"faller.\" The faller as a whole consists of three parts:            1. A long iron or steel rod with provision for being          moved in a closed circuit.            2. Pour or six brass plates, termed \"gills\" or          \"stocks,\" fixed to the rod.            3. A series of short pins (one row sometimes about          1/8 in. shorter than the second row), termed gill or          hackle pins, and set perpendicularly in the above          gills.    The numbers of fallers used is determined partly by the particular  method of operating the fallers, but mostly by the length of the  fibre. The gill pins in the fallers are used to restrain the  movements of the fibres between two important pairs of rollers.  There are actually about four sets of rollers from front to back of  a drawing frame; one set of three rollers constitute the \"retaining\"  rollers; then comes the drawing roller and its large pressing roller;  immediately after this pair is the \"slicking\" rollers, and the last  pair is the delivery rollers. The delivery rollers of one type of  drawing frame, called the \"push-bar\" drawing frame, and made by  Messsrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd., Arbroath, are seen distinctly  in Fig. 17, and the can or cans into which the slivers are  ultimately delivered are placed immediately below one or more  sections of these rollers and in the foreground of the illustration.  The large pressing rollers, which are in contact with the drawing  roller, occupy the highest position in the machine and near the  centre of same. Between these rollers and the retaining rollers are  situated the above-mentioned fallers with their complements of gill  pins, forming, so to speak, a field of pins.    Each sliver, and there maybe from four to eight or more in a set, is  led from its sliver can at the far side of the machine to the sliver  guide and between the retaining rollers. Immediately the slivers  leave the retaining rollers they are penetrated by the gill pins of  a faller which is rising from the lower part of its circuit to the  upper and active position. Each short length of slivers is  penetrated by the pins of a rising faller, these coming up  successively as the preceding one moves along at approximately the  same surface speed as that of the retaining rollers. The sheet of  pins and their fallers are thus continuously moving towards the  drawing rollers and supporting the slivers at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12473"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 06 (#7)"],[1,"in glittering line    And emptied their beakers of sparkling wine.      The beakers they clinked, and the satraps' hurras    in the ears of the stiff-necked King rang his praise.      The King's hot cheeks were with revel dyed,    The wine made swell his heart with pride.      Blind madness his haughty stomach spurred,    And he slandered the Godhead with sinful word,      And strutting in pride he blasphemed, the crowd    Of servile courtiers applauding loud.      The King commanded with haughty stare;    The slave was gone, and again was there.      Much wealth of gold on his head bare he;    'Twas reft from Jehovah's sanctuary.      And the King took hold of a sacred cup    With his impious hand, and they filled it up;      And he drank to the bottom in one deep draught,    And loud, the foam on his lips, he laughed:      \"Jehovah! Thy glories I spit upon;    I am the King of Babylon!\"      But scarce had the awful words been said    When the King's heart withered with secret dread.      The boisterous laughter was stifled all,    And corpselike still did wax the hall;      Lo! lo! on the whited wall there came    The likeness of a man's hand in flame,      And wrote, and wrote, in letters of flame,    And wrote and vanished, and no more came.      The King stark-staring sat, a-quail,    With knees a-knocking, and face death-pale,      The satraps' blood ran cold--none stirred;    They sat like statues, without a word.      The Magians came; but none of them all    Could read those letters of flame on the wall.      But in that same night of his vaunting vain    By his satraps' hand was Belshazzar slain.           *       *       *       *       *    THE PILGRIMAGE TO KEVLAAR[27] (1823)    1      The mother stood at the window;      Her son lay in bed, alas!    \"Will you not get up, dear William,      To see the procession pass?\"      \"O mother, I am so ailing,      I neither can hear nor see;    I think of my poor dead Gretchen,      And my heart grows faint in me.\"      \"Get up, we will go to Kevlaar;      Your book and your rosary take;    The Mother of God will heal you,      And cure your heart of its ache.\"      The Church's banners are waving,      They are chanting a hymn divine;    'Tis at Koeln is that procession,      At Koeln upon the Rhine.      With the throng the mother follows;      Her son she leads with her; and now    They both of them sing in the chorus,      \"Ever honored, O Mary, be thou!\"    2      The Mother of God at Kevlaar      Is drest in her richest array;    She has many a cure on hand there,      Many sick folk come to her today.      And her, for their votive offerings,      The suffering sick folk greet    With limbs that in wax are molded,      Many waxen hands and feet.      And whoso a wax hand offers,      His hand is healed of its sore;    And whoso a wax foot offers,      His foot it will pain him no more.      To Kevlaar went many on crutches      Who now on the tight-rope bound,    And many play now on the fiddle      Had there not one finger sound.      The mother she took a wax taper,      And of it a heart she makes    \"Give that to the Mother of Jesus,      She will cure thee of all thy aches.\"      With a sigh her son took the wax heart,      He went to the shrine with a sigh;    His words from his heart trickle sadly,      As trickle the tears from his eye.      \"Thou blest above all that are blest,      Thou virgin unspotted divine,    Thou Queen of the Heavens, before thee      I lay all my anguish and pine.      \"I lived with my mother at Koeln,      At Koeln in the town that is there,    The town that has hundreds many      Of chapels and churches fair.      \"And Gretchen she lived there near us,    But now she is dead, well-a-day!    O Mary! a wax heart I bring thee,      Heal thou my heart's wound, I pray!      \"Heal thou my heart of its anguish,      And early and late, I vow,    With its whole strength to pray and to sing, too,      'Ever honored, O Mary, be thou!'\"    3      The suffering son and his mother      In their little bed-chamber slept;    Then the Mother of God came softly,      And close to the sleepers crept.      She bent down over the sick one,      And softly her hand did lay    On his heart, with a smile so tender,      And presently vanished away.      The mother sees all in her dreaming,      And other things too she marked;    Then up from her slumber she wakened,      So loudly the town dogs barked.      There lay her son, to his full length      Stretched out, and he was dead;    And the light on his pale cheek flitted      Of the morning's dawning red.      She folded her hands together,      She felt as she knew not how,    And softly she sang and devoutly,      \"Ever honored, O Mary, be thou!\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE RETURN HOME (1823-24)    1[28]      Once upon my life's dark pathway      Gleamed a phantom of delight;    Now that phantom fair has vanished,      I am wholly wrapt in night.      Children in the dark, they suffer      At their heart a spasm of fear;    And, their inward pain to deaden,      Sing aloud, that all may hear.      I, a madcap child, now childlike      In the dark to sing am fain;    If my song be not delightsome,      It at least has eased my pain.    2[29]      We sat at the fisherman's cottage,      And gazed upon the sea;    Then came the mists of evening,      And rose up silently.      The lights within the lighthouse      Were kindled one by one,    We saw still a ship in the distance      On the dim horizon alone.      We spoke of tempest and shipwreck,      Of sailors and of their life,    And how 'twixt clouds and billows      They're tossed, 'twixt joy and strife.      We spoke of distant countries      From North to South that range,    Of strange fantastic nations,      And their customs quaint and strange.      The Ganges is flooded with splendor,      And perfumes waft through the air,    And gentle people are kneeling      To Lotos flowers fair.      In Lapland the people are dirty,      Flat-headed, large-mouthed, and small;    They squat round the fire and, frying      Their fishes, they shout and they squall.      The girls all gravely listened,      Not a word was spoken at last;    The ship we could see no longer,      Darkness was settling so fast.    3[30]      You lovely fisher-maiden,      Bring now the boat to land;    Come here and sit beside me,      We'll prattle hand in hand.      Your head lay on my bosom,      Nor be afraid of me;    Do you not trust all fearless      Daily the great wild sea?      My heart is like the sea, dear,      Has storm, and ebb, and flow,    And many purest pearl-gems      Within its dim depth glow.    4[31]      My child, we were two children,      Small, merry by childhood's law;    We used to creep to the henhouse,      And hide ourselves in the straw.      We crowed like cocks, and whenever      The passers near us drew--    \"Cock-a-doodle!\" They thought      'Twas a real cock that crew.      The boxes about our courtyard      We carpeted to our mind,    And lived there both together--      Kept house in a noble kind.      The neighbor's old cat often      Came to pay us a visit;    We made her a bow and courtesy,      Each with a compliment in it.      After her health we asked,      Our care and regard to evince--    (We have made the very same speeches      To many an old cat since).      We also sat and wisely      Discoursed, as old folks do,    Complaining how all went better      In those good old times we knew--      How love, and truth, and believing      Had left the world to itself,    And how so dear was the coffee,      And how so rare was the pelf.      The children's games are over,      The rest is over with youth--    The world, the good games, the good times,      The belief, and the love, and the truth.    5[32]      E'en as a lovely flower,      So fair, so pure thou art;    I gaze on thee, and sadness      Comes stealing o'er my heart.      My hands I fain had folded      Upon thy soft brown hair,    Praying that God may keep thee      So lovely, pure, and fair.    6[33]      I would that my love and its sadness      Might a single word convey,    The joyous breezes should bear it,      And merrily waft it away.      They should waft it to thee, beloved,      This soft and wailful word,    At every hour thou shouldst hear it,      Where'er thou art 'twould be heard.      And when in the night's first slumber      Thine eyes scarce closing seem,    Still should my word pursue thee      Into thy deepest dream.    7[34]      The shades of the summer evening lie      On the forest and meadows green;    The golden moon shines in the azure sky      Through balm-breathing air serene.      The cricket is chirping the brooklet near,      In the water a something stirs,    And the wanderer can in the stillness hear      A plash and a sigh through the furze.      There all by herself the fairy bright      Is bathing down in the stream;    Her arms and throat, bewitching and white,      In the moonshine glance and gleam.    8[35]      I know not what evil is coming,      But my heart feels sad and cold;    A song in my head keeps humming,      A tale from the times of old.      The air is fresh and it darkles,      And smoothly flows the Rhine;    The peak of the mountain sparkles      In the fading sunset-shine.      The loveliest wonderful maiden      On high is sitting there,    With golden jewels braiden,      And she combs her golden hair.      With a golden comb sits combing,    And ever the while sings she    A marvelous song through the gloaming    Of magical melody.      It hath caught the boatman, and bound him    In the spell of a wild, sad love;    He sees not the rocks around him,    He sees only her above.      The waves through the pass keep swinging,    But boatman or boat is none;    And this with her mighty singing    The Lorelei hath done.    [Illustration: ROCKY COAST _From"]]]
