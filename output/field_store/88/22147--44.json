At the close of this period the immigrant Aryans had reduced to  slavery many of their unbelieving and barbarian enemies, and formally  incorporated them into the state organization, where, as captives,  slaves, or sons of slaves, the latter formed the \"fourth caste.\" But  while admitting these slaves into the body politic, the priestly  Aryans debarred them from the religious congregation. Between the  Aryans themselves there is in this period a loosely defined  distinction of classes, but no system of caste is known before the  close of the first Vedic Collection. Nevertheless, the emphasis in  this statement lies strongly upon system, and it may not be quite idle  to say at the outset that the general caste-distinctions not only are  as old as the Indo-Iranian unity (among the Persians the same division  of priest, warrior and husbandman obtains), but, in all probability,  they are much older. For so long as there is a cult, even if it be of  spirits and devils, there are priests; and if there are chieftains  there is a nobility, such as one finds among the Teutons, nay, even  among the American Indians, where also is known the inevitable  division into priests, chiefs and commons, sometimes hereditary,  sometimes not. There must have been, then, from the beginning of  kingship and religious service, a division among the Aryans into  royalty, priests, and people, i.e., whoever were not acting as priests  or chieftains. When the people becomes agricultural, the difference  tends to become permanent, and a caste system begins. Now, the Vedic  Aryans appear in history at just the period when they are on the move  southwards into India; but they are no irrupting host. The battles led  the warriors on, but the folk, as a folk, moved slowly, not all  abandoning the country which they had gained, but settling there, and  sending onwards only a part of the people. There was no fixed line of  demarcation between the classes. The king or another might act as his  own priest--yet were there priestly families. The cow-boys might  fight--yet were there those of the people that were especially  'kingsmen,' _r[=a]janyas_, and these were, already, practically a  class, if not a caste[6]. These natural and necessary social  divisions, which in early times were anything but rigid, soon formed  inviolable groups, and then the caste system was complete. In the  perfected legal scheme what was usage becomes duty. The warrior may  not be a public priest; the priest may not serve as warrior or  husbandman. The farmer 'people' were the result of eliminating first  the priestly, and then the fighting factors from the whole body  politic. But these castes were all Aryans, and as such distinguished  most sharply, from a religious point of view, from the \"fourth caste\";  whereas among themselves they were, in religion, equals. But they were  practically divided by interests that strongly affected the  development of their original litanies. For both priest and warrior  looked down on the 'people,' but priest and warrior feared and  respected each other. To these the third estate was necessary as a  base of supplies, and together they guarded it from foes divine and  mortal. But to each other they were necessary for wealth and glory,  respectively. So it was that even in the earliest period the religious  litany, to a great extent, is the book of worship of a warrior-class  as prepared for it by the priest. Priest and king--these are the main  factors in the making of the hymns of the Rig Veda, and the gods  lauded are chiefly the gods patronized by these classes. The third  estate had its favorite gods, but these were little regarded, and were  in a state of decadence. The slaves, too, may have had their own gods,  but of these nothing is known, and one can only surmise that here and  there in certain traits, which seem to be un-Aryan, may lie an  unacknowledged loan from the aborigines.    Between the Rig Veda and the formation or completion of the next Veda,  called the Atharvan, the interval appears to have been considerable,  and the inherent value of the religion inculcated in the latter can be  estimated aright only when this is weighed together with the fact,  that, as is learned from the Atharvan's own statements, the Aryans  were now advanced further southwards and eastwards, had discovered a  new land, made new gods, and were now more permanently established,  the last a factor of some moment in the religious development.  Indications of the difference in time may be seen in the geographical  and physical limitations of the older period as compared with those of  the later Atharvan. When first the Aryans are found in India, at the  time of the Rig Veda, they are located, for the most part, near the  Upper Indus (Sindhu). The Ganges, mentioned but twice, is barely  known. On the west the Aryans lingered in East Kabulistan (possibly in  Kashmeer in the north); and even Kandahar appears, at least, to be  known as Aryan. That is to say, the 'Hindus' were still in  Afghanistan, although the greater mass of the people had already  crossed the Indus and were progressed some distance to the east of the  Punj[=a]b. That the race was still migrating may be seen from the  hymns of the Rig Veda itself.[7] Their journey was to the south-east,  and both before and after they reached the Indus they left  settlements, chiefly about the Indus and in the Punj[=a]b (a  post-Vedic group), not in the southern but in the northern part of  this district.[8]    The Vedic Aryans of this first period were acquainted with the Indus,  Sutlej (Cutudri), Beas (Vip[=a]c, [Greek: Yphtsis]), Ravi (Parushni or  Ir[=a]vat[=i]); the pair of rivers that unite and flow into the Indus,  viz.: Jhelum (Vitast[=a], Behat), and Chin[=a]b (Asikni,[9] Akesines);  and knew the remoter Kubh[=a] ([Greek: Kophhen], Kabul) and the  northern Suv[=a]stu (Swat); while they appear to have had a legendary  remembrance of the Ras[=a], Avestan Ra[.n]ha (Rangha), supposed by  some to be identical with the Araxes or Yaxartes, but probably (see  below) only a vague 'stream,' the old name travelling with them on  their wanderings; for one would err if he regarded similarity or even  identity of appellation as a proof of real identity.[10] West of the  Indus the Kurum and Gomal appear to be known also. Many rivers are  mentioned of which the names are given, but their location is not  established. It is from the district west of the Indus that the most  famous Sanskrit grammarian comes, and long after the Vedas an Indic  people are known in the Kandahar district, while Kashmeer was a late  home of culture. The Sarasvati river, the name of which is transferred  at least once in historical times, may have been originally one with  the Arghand[=a]b (on which is Kandahar), for the Persian name of this  river (_s_ becomes _h_) is Harahvati (Arachotos, Arachosia), and it is  possible that it was really this river, and not the Indus which was  first lauded as the Sarasvat[=i]. In that case there would be a  perfect parallel to what has probably happened in the case of the  Ras[=a], the name--in both cases meaning only 'the stream' (like  Rhine, Arno, etc.)--being transferred to a new river. But since the  Iranian Harahvati fixes the first river of this name, there is here a  stronger proof of Indo-Iranian community than is furnished by other  examples.[11]    These facts or suggestive parallels of names are of exceeding  importance. They indicate between the Vedic Aryans and the Iranians a  connection much closer than usually has been assumed. The bearings of  such a connection on the religious ideas of the two peoples are  self-evident, and will often have to be touched upon in the course of  this history. It is of less importance, from the present point of  view, to say how the Aryans entered India, but since this question is  also connected with that of the religious environment of the first  Hindu poets, it will be well to state that, although, as some scholars  maintain, and as we believe, the Hindus may have come with the  Iranians through the open pass of Herat (Haraiva, Haroyu), it is  possible that they parted from the latter south of the Hindukush[12]  (descending through the Kohistan passes from the north), and that the  two peoples thence diverged south-east and south-west respectively.  Neither assumption would prevent the country lying between the  Harahvati and Vitast[=a][13] from being, for generations, a common  camping-ground for both peoples, who were united still, but gradually  diverging. This seems, at least, to be the most reasonable explanation  of the fact that these two rivers are to each people their farthest  known western and eastern limits respectively. With the exception of  the vague and uncertain Ras[=a], the Vedic Hindu's geographical  knowledge is limited by Kandahar in the west, as is the Iranian's in  the east by the Vitast[=a].[14] North of the Vitast[=a] Mount Tricota  (Trikakud, 'three peaks') is venerated, and this together with a Mount  M[=u]javat, of which the situation is probably in the north, is the  extent of modern knowledge in respect of the natural boundaries of the  Vedic people. One hears, to be sure, at a later time, of 'northern  Kurus,' whose felicity is proverbial; and it is very tempting to find  in this name a connection with the Iranian Kur, but the Kurus, like  the Ras[=a] and Sarasvat[=i], are re-located once (near Delhi), and no  similarity of name can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#7)"],[1," definite hour in the daily routine. There is sometimes too great  a tendency for parents to make playthings of their little children.  Save at stated times, they must curb their desire to join in their  games, to gather them in their arms, to hold them on their knee, while  they stimulate their minds by a constant succession of new  impressions. With an only child, whose existence is the single  preoccupation of the nurse and mother, and, often enough, of the  father as well, it is difficult to avoid this fault. Yet, if wisdom is  not learnt, the damage to the child may be distressingly serious. He  rapidly grows incapable of supporting life without this excessive  stimulation. Without the constant society and attention of a grown  person, he feels himself lost. He cannot be left alone, and yet cannot  enjoy the society he craves. He grows more and more restless,  dominating the whole situation more and more, constantly plucking at  his nurse's skirts, perversely refusing every new sensation that is  offered him to still his restlessness for a moment. The result of all  this stimulation is mental irritability and exhaustion, which in turn  is often the direct cause of refusal of food, dyspepsia, wakefulness,  and excessive crying.    The devices by which children will attract to themselves the  attention of their elders, and which, if successful, are repeated with  an almost insane persistence, take on the most varied forms. Sometimes  the child persistently makes use of an expression, or asks questions,  which produce a pleasant stir of shocked surprise and renewed reproofs  and expostulations. One little boy shouted the word \"stomachs\" with  unwearied persistence for many weeks together. A little girl dismayed  her parents and continued in spite of all they could do to prevent her  to ask every one if they were about to pass water.    Disorders of conduct of this sort are not really difficult to control.  Suitable punishment will succeed, provided also that the child is  deprived of the sense of satisfaction which he has in the interest  which his conduct excites. His behaviour is only of importance because  it indicates certain faults in his environment and a certain element  of nervous unrest and overstrain.    The young child demands from his environment that it should give him  two things--security and liberty. He must have security from shocks to  his nervous system. It is true that from the greater shocks the  children of the well-to-do are as a rule carefully guarded. No one  threatens or ill-uses them. They are not terrified by drunken brawls  or scenes of passion. They are not made fearful by the superstitions  of ignorant people. Nevertheless, by the summation of stimuli little  emotions constantly repeated can have effects no less grave upon  their nervous system. From this constantly acting irritation the child  needs security. In the second place, he requires liberty to develop  his own initiative, which should be stimulated and sustained and  directed. Without liberty and without security conduct cannot fail to  become abnormal.      (_d_) THE REASONING POWER OF THE CHILD    Before we proceed to a closer examination of the various symptoms of  nervous unrest in detail, we may very briefly consider the scope and  power of the child's understanding. As a rule I am sure that it is  grossly underestimated. The mental processes of the child are far  ahead of his power of speech. The capacity for understanding speech is  well advanced, and an appeal to reason is often successful while the  child is still powerless to express his own thoughts in words. Because  he cannot so express himself there is a tendency to underestimate the  acuteness of his reasoning, to talk down to him, and to imagine that  he can be imposed upon by any fiction which seems likely to suit the  purpose of the moment. A child of eighteen months is not too young to  be talked to in a quiet, straightforward, sensible way. Only if he is  treated as a reasonable being can we expect his reasoning faculties to  develop. Children dislike intensely the unexplained intervention of  force. If a pair of scissors, left by an oversight lying about, has  been grasped, the first impulse of the mother is to snatch the danger  hurriedly from the child's hands, and her action will generally be  followed by resistance and a storm of weeping. She will do better to  approach him quietly, telling him that scissors hurt babies, and show  him where to place them out of harm's way. Watch a child at play after  his midday meal. He has been out in his perambulator half the morning,  and for the other half has been deep in his midday sleep. Now that  dinner is over he is for a moment master of his time and busily  engaged in some pursuit dear to his heart. At two o'clock inexorable  routine ordains that he must again be placed in the perambulator and  wheeled forth on a fresh expedition. If the nurse does not know her  business she will swoop down upon him, place him on her knee, and  begin to envelop his struggling little body in his outdoor clothes,  scolding his naughtiness as he kicks and screams. If she has a way  with children she will open the cupboard door and call on him to help  find his gaiters and his shoes because it is time for his walk. In a  moment he will leave his toys, forgetting all about them in the joy of  this new activity.    If the reason for things is explained to children they grow quick to  understand quite complicated explanations. A little girl, not yet two,  was playing with her Noah's Ark on the dining-room table with its  polished surface. The mother interposed a cloth, explaining that the  animals would scratch the table if the cloth were not there. Within a  few minutes the child twice lifted the cloth, peering under it and  saying, \"Not scratch table.\" Yet how often do we find  facetiously-minded persons confound their reasoning and confuse their  judgment by foolish speeches and cock-and-bull tales, which, just  because of their foolishness, seem to them well adapted to the infant  intelligence.    An attempt to deceive the child is almost always wrong, and because of  our tendency to underestimate the child's intelligence it generally  fails. If a little girl has a sore throat, and the doctor comes to see  her, she knows quite well that she is the prospective patient. It is  useless for the mother to begin proceedings by trying to convince her  that this is not so--that mother has a sore throat too. Such a plan  only arouses apprehension, because the child scents danger in the  artifice.    Closely connected with the reasoning powers of the child is the  difficult question of the growth of his appreciation of right and  wrong, or, to put it in another way, the growth of obedience or  disobedience. Sooner or later the child must learn to obey; on that  there can be no two opinions. Nevertheless, I think there can be no  doubt that far more harm is done by an over-emphasis of authority than  by its neglect. If the nurse or mother is of strong character, and the  authority is exercised persistently and remorselessly, so that the  whole life of the child is dominated, much as the recruit's existence  in the barrack yard is dominated by the drill sergeant, his  independence of nature is crushed. He is certain to become a  colourless and uninteresting child; he runs a grave risk of growing  sly, broken-spirited, and a currier of favour. If a child is  ruthlessly punished for disobedience from his earliest years, there  is, it need hardly be said, a grave risk that he will learn to lie to  save his skin. I have seen a few such cases of what I may call the  remorseless exercise of authority, and the result has not been  pleasing. Fortunately, perhaps, not many women have the heart to adopt  this attitude to the waywardness of little children--a waywardness to  which their whole nature compels them by their pressing need to  cultivate tactile sensations, to experiment, and to explore.  Therefore, much more commonly, the authority is exercised  intermittently and capriciously, with the result that the child's  judgment is clouded and confused. Conduct which is received  indulgently or even encouraged at one moment is sternly reprimanded at  another. Every one who has the management of little children must  above all see to it, whatever the degree of stringency in discipline  which they decide to adopt, that their attitude is always consistent.  The less that is forbidden the better, but when the line is drawn it  must be adhered to. If once the child learns that the force which  restrains him can be made to yield to his own efforts, the future is  black indeed. From that day he sets himself to strike down authority  with a success which encourages him to further efforts. I have known a  child of five years terrorise his mother and get his own way by the  threat, \"I will go into one of my furies.\"    The difficulty of successfully enforcing authority, and of carrying  off the victory if that authority is disputed, should make mothers  wary of drawing too tight a rein. The conflict between parent and  child must always be distressing and must always be prejudicial to the  child, whatever its outcome, whether it brings to him victory or  defeat. He learns from it either an undue sense of power or an undue  sense of helplessness, and the knowledge of neither is to his benefit.  Although frequently worsted in the conflict, nurses will often return  to the attack again and again and hour after hour, restraining,  reproving, forbidding, and even threatening. Nor do they see that they  are really goading the children into disobedience by their misdirected  efforts at enforcing discipline. Reproof, like punishment, loses all  its effect when it is too often repeated, and the child soon takes it  for granted that all he does is wrong, and that grown-up people exist  only to thwart his will, to misunderstand, to reprove, or even to"]]]
