You give too much to common beggars; I am  determined to stop it--do not ask me any further.\"    A kind of convulsion passed over John Lawson's thin face; but he  pressed his hand closely on his breast, and was silent for some  moments.    \"I was once rich, I believe. Yes--it is not a dream,\" he said, in a  slow, self-communing voice. \"Gold and silver, once ye were plenty with  me; my hands--my pockets were filled--guineas, crowns, shillings--now  I have not one penny to give to that starving, dying woman, whose face  of misery might soften the very stones she looks on--not one penny.\"    \"Augusta,\" he said, turning suddenly toward her, after a second pause  of silence, \"give me only one shilling, and I shall not think of the  bitter words you have just said.\"    \"No; not one shilling,\" answered Mrs. Lawson, turning over a leaf of  her novel.    \"One sixpence, then--one small, poor sixpence. You do not know how  even a sixpence can gladden the black heart of poverty when starvation  is come. One sixpence, I say--let me have it quickly.\"    \"Not one farthing I shall give you. I do beg you will trouble me no  further.\"    Mrs. Lawson turned her back partially to him, and fixed all her  attention on the novel.    \"Woman! I have cringed and begged; I would not so beg for myself,  from you--no: I would lie down and die of want before I would, on my  own account, request of you--of your hard heart--one bit of bread.  All the finery that surrounds you is mine--it was purchased with my  money, though now you call it yours; and, usurping the authority of  both master and mistress here, you--in what you please to call your  economical management--dole out shillings to me when the humor seizes  you, or refuse me, as now, when it pleases you. But, woman, listen  to me. I shall never request you for one farthing of money again. No  necessity of others shall make me do it. You shall never again refuse  me, for I shall never give you the opportunity.\"    He turned hastily from the room, with a face on which the deep emotion  of an aroused spirit was depicted strongly.    In the lobby he met his son, Henry Lawson. The young man paused,  something struck by the excited appearance of his father.    \"Henry,\" said the father, abruptly, \"I want some money; there is a  poor woman whom I wish to relieve--will you give me some money for  her?\"    \"Willingly, my dear father; but have you asked Augusta? You know  I have given her the management of the money-matters of the  establishment, she is so very clever and economical.\"    \"She has neither charity, nor pity, nor kindness; she saves from  me--she saves from the starving poor--she saves, that she may waste  large sums on parties and dresses. I shall never more ask her for  money--give me a few shillings. My God! the father begs of the son for  what was his own--for what he toiled all his youth--for what he gave  up out of trusting love to that son. Henry, my son, I am sick of  asking and begging--ay, sick--sick; but give me some shillings now.\"    \"You asked Augusta, then,\" said Henry, drawing out his purse, and  glancing with some apprehension to the drawing-room door.    \"Henry,\" cried Mrs. Lawson, appearing at that instant with a face  inflamed with anger--\"Henry, _I_ would not give your father any money  to-day, because he is so very extravagant in giving it all away.\"    Henry was in the act of opening his purse; he glanced apprehensively  to Mrs. Lawson; his face had a mild and passive expression, which was  a true index of his yielding and easily-governed nature. His features  were small, delicate, and almost effeminately handsome; and in every  lineament a want of decision and force of character was visible.    \"Henry, give me some shillings, I say--I am your father--I have a just  right.\"    \"Yes, yes, surely\" said Henry, making a movement to open his purse.    \"Henry, I do not wish you to give him money to waste in charity, as he  calls it.\"    Mrs. Lawson gave her husband an emphatic, but, at the same time,  cunningly caressing and smiling look.    \"Henry, I am your father--give me the money I want.\"    \"Augusta, my love, you know it was all his,\" said Henry, going close  to her, and speaking in a kind of whisper.    \"My dearest Henry, were it for any other purpose but for throwing  away, I would not refuse. I am your father's best friend, and your  best friend, in wishing to restrain all extravagance.\"    \"My dear father, she wishes to be economical, you know.\"    He dangled the purse, undecidedly, in his fingers.    \"Will you give me the money at once, and let me go?\" cried John  Lawson, elevating his voice.    \"My dear Augusta, it is better--\"    \"Henry, do not, I beg of you.\"    \"Henry, my son, will you let me have the money?\"    \"Indeed, Augusta--\"    \"Henry!\"    Mrs. Lawson articulated but the one word; there was enough of energy  and determination in it to make her husband close the purse he had  almost opened.    \"I ask you only this once more--give me the few shillings?\"    John Lawson bent forward in an eager manner; a feverish red kindled  on his sallow cheeks; his eyes were wildly dilated, and his lips  compressed. There was a pause of some moments.    \"You will not give it me?\" he said, in a voice deep-toned and  singularly calm, as contrasted with his convulsed face.    Henry dangled the purse again in his hand, and looked uneasily and  irresolutely toward his wife.    \"No, he will not give it--you will get no money to squander on poor  people this day,\" Mrs. Lawson said, in a very sharp and decided voice.    John Lawson did not say another word; he turned away and slowly  descended the stairs, and walked out of the house.    He did not return that evening. He had been seen on the road leading  to the house of a relative who was in rather poor circumstances. Henry  felt rather annoyed at his fathers absence; he had no depth in his  affection, but he had been accustomed to see him and hear his voice  every day, and therefore he missed him, but consoled himself with  the thought that they would soon meet again, as it never entered his  imagination that his father had quitted the house for a lengthened  period. Mrs. Lawson felicitated herself on the event, and hoped that  the old man would remain for some time with his relative.    The following day a letter was handed to Henry; it was from his  father, and was as follows:    \"TO MY SON HENRY--I have at last come to the resolution of quitting  your house, which I can no longer call mine, in even the least degree.  For weeks--for months--ever since you married--ever since your wife  took upon herself what she calls the management of your house and  purse, I have felt bound down under the weight of an oppressive  bondage. I could not go and take a pound or a shilling from our common  stock, as I used to do before you married, when you and I lived in one  mind, and when I believed that the very spirit of your departed, your  angel mother, dwelt in you, as you had, and have still, her very face  and form. No, no, we had no common stock when you married. She put me  on an allowance--ay, an allowance. You lived, and saw me receiving  an allowance; you whom I loved with an idolatry which God has now  punished; you to whom I freely gave up my business--my money-making  business. I gave it you--I gave all to you--I would have given my  very life and soul to you, because I thought that with your mother's  own face you had her noble and generous nature. You were kind before  you married; but that marriage has proved your weakness and want of  natural affection. Yes, you stood at my side yesterday; you looked  on my face--I, the father who loved you beyond all bounds of fatherly  love--you stood and heard me beg for a few shillings; you heard me  supplicate earnestly and humbly, and you would not give because your  wife was not willing. Henry, I could force you to give me a share of  the profits of your business; but keep it--keep it all. You would not  voluntarily give me some shillings, and I shall not demand what right  and justice would give me. Keep all, every farthing.    \"It was for charity I asked the few shillings; you know it. You  know from whom I imbibed whatever I possess of the blessed spirit of  charity. I was as hard and unpitying as even your wife before your  mother taught me to feel and relieve the demands of poverty. Yes, and  she taught you; you cannot forget it. She taught you to give food to  the starving, in your earliest days. She strove to impress your infant  mind with the very soul of charity; and yesterday she looked down from  the heaven of the holy departed, and saw you refusing me, your father,  a few shillings to bestow on charity.    \"Henry, I can live with you and your wife no more. I should grow  avaricious in my old age, were I to remain with you. I should long  for money to call my own. Those doled out shillings which I received  wakened within me feelings of a dark nature--covetousness, and envy,  and discontent--which must have shadowed the happiness of your mother  in heaven to look down upon. I must go and seek out an independent  living for myself, even yet, though I am fifty-two. Though my energies  for struggling with the world died, I thought, when your mother died,  and, leaving my active business to you, I retired to live in the  country, I must go forth again, as if I were young, to seek for  the means of existence, for I feel I was not made to be a beggar--a  creature hanging on the bounty of others; no, no, the merciful God  will give me strength yet to provide for myself, though I am old, and  broken down in mind and body. Farewell; you who were once my beloved  son, may God soften and amend your heart.\"    When Henry perused this letter, he would immediately have gone in  search of his father, in order to induce him to return home; but Mrs.  Lawson was at his side, and succeeded in persuading him to allow his  father to act as he pleased, and remain away as long "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13056"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 10 (#7)"],[1,"egotist, I mocked his pain by describing my  happiness, and in five pages did not refer to his mourning by even a  syllable, speaking of myself again and again, and using him as  father-confessor. He is an awkward comforter who does not himself feel  pain sympathetically, or not vividly enough. My first grief was the  passionate, selfish one at the loss I had sustained; for Marie,[11] so  far as she is concerned, I do not feel it, because I know that she is  well provided for, but that my sympathy with the suffering of my  warmest friend, to whom I owe eternal thanks, is not strong enough to  produce a word of comfort, of strong consolation from overflowing  feeling, that burdens me sorely. Weep not, my angel; let your sympathy  be strong and full of confidence in God; give him real consolation  with encouragement, not with tears, and, if you can, doubly, for  yourself and for your thankless friend whose heart is just now filled  with you and has room for nothing else. Are you a withered leaf, a  faded garment? I will see whether my love can foster the verdure once  more, can brighten up the colors. You must put forth fresh leaves, and  the old ones I shall lay between the pages of the book of my heart so  that we may find them when we read there, as tokens of fond  recollection. You have fanned to life again the coal that under ashes  and debris still glowed in me; it shall envelop you in life-giving  flames.    _Le souper est servi_, the evening is gone, and I have done nothing  but chat with you and smoke: is that not becoming employment for the  dike-captain? Why not?    A mysterious letter from ---- lies before me. He writes in a tone new  for him; admits that he perceives that he did many a wrong to his first  wife; did not always rightly guide and bear with her weakness; was no  prop to the \"child,\" and believes himself absolved by this severe  castigation. _Qu'est-ce qu'il me chante_? Has the letter undergone  transformation in the Christian climate of Reinfeld, or did it leave the  hand of this once shallow buffoon in its present form? He asserts,  moreover, that he lives in a never dreamed of happiness with his present  wife, whose acquaintance he made a week before the engagement, and whom  he married six weeks after the same event: a happiness which his first  marriage has taught him rightly to prize. Do you know the story of the  French tiler who falls from the roof, and, in passing the second story,  cries out, \"_Ca va bien, pourvu que ca dure_?\" Think, only, if we had  been betrothed on the 12th of October '44, and, on November 23d, had  married: What anxiety for mamma!    The English poems of mortal misery trouble me no more now; that was of  old, when I looked out into nothing--cold and stiff, snow-drifts in my  heart. Now a black cat plays with it in the sunshine, as though with a  rolling skein, and I like to see its rolling. I will give you, at the  end of this letter, a few more verses belonging to that period, of  which fragmentary copies are still preserved, as I see, in my  portfolio. You may allow me to read them still; they harm me no more.  _Thine eyes have still (and will always have) a charm for me_.[12]  Please write me in your next letter about the uncertain  marriage-plans. I believe, _by Jove!_[12] that the matter is becoming  serious. Until the day is fixed, it still seems to me as though we had  been dreaming; or have I really passed a fortnight in Reinfeld, and  held you in these arms of mine? Has Finette been found again? Do you  remember our conversation when we went out with her in leash--when  you, little rogue, said you would have \"given me the mitten\" had not  God taken pity on me and permitted me at least a peep through the  keyhole of His door of mercy! That came into my mind when I was  reading I Cor. vii. 13 and 14 yesterday.    [Illustration: PRINCE BISMARCK FRANZ VON LENBACH]    A commentator says of the passage that, in all relations of life,  Christ regards the kingdom of God as the more powerful, victorious,  finally overcoming all opposition, and the kingdom of darkness as  powerless, falling in ruins ever more and more. Yet, how do most  of you have so little confidence in your faith, and wrap it carefully  in the cotton of isolation, lest it take cold from any draught of  the world; while others are vexed with you, and proclaim that you  are people who esteem yourselves too holy to come into contact  with publicans, etc. If every one should think so who believes he  has found truth--and many serious, upright, humble seekers do believe  they find it elsewhere, or in another form--what a Pennsylvania  solitary-confinement prison would God's beautiful earth become,  divided up into thousands and thousands of exclusive coteries by  insuperable partitions! Compare, also, Rom. xiv. 22 and xv. 2; also,  particularly, I Cor. iv. 5; viii. 2; ix. 20; also xii. 4 and the  following; further, xiii. 2; all in the First Ep. to the Cor., which  seems to me to apply to the subject. We talked, during that walk, or  another one, a great deal about \"the sanctity of doing good works.\" I  will not inundate you with Scripture passages in this connection, but  only tell you how splendid I find the Epistle of James. (Matt. xxv. 34  and following; Rom. ii. 6; II Cor. v. 10; Rom. ii. 13; I Epistle of  John iii. 7, and countless others.) It is, indeed, unprofitable to  base arguments upon separate passages of Scripture apart from their  connection; but there are many who are honestly striving, and who  attach more importance to passages like James ii. 14 than to Mark xvi.  16, and for the latter passage offer expositions, holding them to be  correct, which do not literally agree with yours. To what  interpretation does the word \"faith\" not lend itself, both when taken  alone and in connection with that which the Scriptures command us \"to  believe,\" in every single instance where they employ the word! Against  my will, I fall into spiritual discussion and controversies. Among  Catholics the Bible is read not at all, or with great precaution, by  the laity; it is expounded only by the priests, who have concerned  themselves all their lives with the study of the original sources. In  the end, all depends upon the interpretation. Concert in Buetow amuses  me: the idea of Buetow is, to my mind, the opposite of all music.    I have been quite garrulous, have I not? Now I must disturb some  document-dust, and sharpen my pen afresh to the police-official style,  for the president of the provincial court and the government. Could I  but enclose myself herewith, or go along in a salmon-basket as  mail-matter! Till we meet again, _dearest black one_.[13] I love you,  _c'est tout dire_.    BISMARCK.    (I am forgetting the English verses):      \"Sad dreams, as when the spirit of our youth    Returns in sleep, sparkling with all the truth    And innocence, once ours, and leads us back    In mournful mockery over the shining track    Of our young life, and points out every ray    Of hope and peace we've lost upon the way!\"    By Moore, I think; perhaps Byron.      \"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,    To the last syllable of recorded time;    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,    And then is heard no more: it is a tale    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,    Signifying nothing.\"    Cordial remembrances to your parents and the Reddentin folk.      Schoenhausen, February 23, '47.    _My Angel!_--I shall not send this letter on its way tomorrow, it's  true, but I do want to make use of the few unoccupied minutes left me  to satisfy the need I am conscious of every hour, to communicate with  you, and forthwith to compose a \"Sunday letter\" to you once more.  Today I have been \"on the move\" all day long. \"The Moorish king rode  up and down,\" unfortunately not \"through Granada's royal town,\" but  between Havelberg and Jerichow, on foot, in a carriage, and on  horseback, and got mighty cold doing so--because, after the warm  weather of the last few days, I had not made the slightest preparation  to encounter five degrees below freezing, with a cutting north wind,  and was too much in haste or too lazy to mount the stairs again when I  noticed the fresh air. During the night it had been quite endurable  and superb moonlight. A beautiful spectacle it was, too, when the  great fields of ice first set themselves massively in motion, with  explosions like cannon-shots, shattering themselves against one  another; they rear, shoving over and under each other; they pile up  house-high, and sometimes build dams obliquely across the Elbe, in  front of which the pent stream rises until it breaks through them with  rage. Now are they all broken to pieces in the battle--the giants--and  the water very thickly covered with ice-cakes, the largest of which  measure several square rods, which it bears out to the free sea like  shattered chains, with grumbling, clashing noises. This will go on so  for about three days more, until the ice that comes from Bohemia,  which passed the bridge at Dresden several days ago, has gone by. (The  danger is that the ice-cakes by jamming together may make a dam, and  the stream rise in front of this--often ten to fifteen feet in a few  hours.) Then comes the freshet from the mountains which floods the bed  of the Elbe, often a mile in width, and is dangerous in itself, owing  to its volume. How long that is to last we cannot tell beforehand. The  prevailing cold weather, combined with the contrary sea wind, will  certainly retard it. It may easily last so long that it will not be  worth while to go to Reinfeld before the 20th. If only eight days  should be left me, would you have me undertake it, nevertheless?--or  will you wait to have me without interruption after the 20th,"]]]
