There is a keen, cunning pretender-prince who  is a past-master in the fine art of handling men. There are wills warped  and weakened; consciences blurred; minds the opposite of keen,  sensibilities whose edge has been dulled beyond ordinary hope of being  ever made keen again. Sin has not only stained the life, but warped the  judgment, sapped the will, and blurred the mental vision. And God has a  hard time just because every change must of necessity be through that  sapped and warped will.    Yet the difficulty though great is never complex but very simple. And so  the statement of His purpose is ever exquisitely simple. Listen again:  \"Call unto Me, and I will answer thee and shew thee great things and  difficult which thou knowest not.\" If a man call he has already turned his  face towards God. His will has acted, and acted doubly; away from the  opposite, and _towards_ God, a simple step but a tremendous one. The  calling is the point of sympathetic contact with God where their purposes  become the same. The caller is beset by difficulties and longs for  freedom. The God who speaks to him saw the difficulties long ago and  eagerly longed to remove them. Now they have come to agreement. And  through this willing will God eagerly works out His purpose.        <u>A Very Old Question.</u>      This leads to a very old question: Does prayer influence God? No question  has been discussed more, or more earnestly. Skeptical men of fine  scientific training have with great positiveness said \"no.\" And Christian  men of scholarly training and strong faith have with equal positiveness  said \"yes.\" Strange to say both have been right. Not right in all their  statements, nor right in all their beliefs, nor right in all their  processes of thinking, but right in their ultimate conclusions as  represented by these short words, \"no,\" and \"yes.\" Prayer does not  influence God. Prayer surely does influence God. It does not influence His  purpose. It does influence His action. Everything that ever has been  prayed for, of course I mean every right thing, God has already purposed  to do. But He does nothing without our consent. He has been hindered in  His purposes by our lack of willingness. When we learn His purposes and  make them our prayers we are giving Him the opportunity to act. It is a  double opportunity: manward and Satanward. We are willing. Our willingness  checkmates Satan's opposition. It opens the path to God and rids it of the  obstacles. And so the road is cleared for the free action already planned.    The further question of nature's laws being sometimes set aside is wholly  a secondary matter. Nature's laws are merely God's habit of action in  handling secondary forces. They involve no purpose of God. His purposes  are regarding moral issues. That the sun shall stay a bit longer than  usual over a certain part of the earth is a mere detail with God. It does  not affect His power for the whole affair is under His finger. It does not  affect His purpose for that as concerning far more serious matters. The  emergencies of earth wrought by sin necessitate just such incidents, that  the great purpose of God for man shall be accomplished.    Emergencies change all habits of action, divine and human. They are the  real test of power. If a man throw down the bundle he is carrying and make  a quick wild dash out into the middle of the street, dropping his hat on  the way, and grasp convulsively for something on the ground when no cause  appears for such action we would quickly conclude that the proper place  for him is an asylum. But if a little toddling child is almost under the  horse's hoofs, or the trolley car, no one thinks of criticising, but  instead admires his courage, and quick action, and breathlessly watches  for the result. Emergencies call for special action. They should control  actions, where they exist. Emergencies explain action, and explain  satisfactorily what nothing else could explain.    _The world is in a great emergency through sin._ Only as that tremendous  fact grips us shall we be men of prayer, and men of action up to the limit  of the need, and to the limit of the possibilities. Only as that intense  fact is kept in mind shall we begin to understand God's actions in  history, and in our personal experiences. The greatest event of earth, the  cross, was an emergency action.    The fact that prayer does not make any change in God's thought or  purpose, reveals His marvellous love in a very tender way.    Suppose I want something very much and _need_ as well as want. And I go to  God and ask for it. And suppose He is reluctant about giving: had not  thought about giving me that thing; and rather hesitates. But I am  insistent, and plead and persist and by and by God is impressed with my  earnestness, and sees that I really need the thing, and answers my prayer,  and gives me what I ask. Is not that a loving God so to listen and yield  to my plea? Surely. How many times just such an instance has taken place  between a child and his father, or mother. And the child thinks to  himself, \"How loving father is; he has given me the thing I asked for.\"    But suppose God is thinking about me all the time, and planning, with  love-plans for me, and longing to give me much that He has. Yet in His  wisdom He does not give because I do not know my own need, and have not  opened my hand to receive, yes, and, further yet, likely as not, not  knowing my need I might abuse, or misuse, or fail to use, something given  before I had felt the need of it. And now I come to see and feel that need  and come and ask and He, delighted with the change in me, eagerly gives.  Tell me, is not that a very much more loving God than the other conception  suggests? The truth is _that_ is God. Jesus says, \"Your Father knoweth  what things ye have need of _before ye ask_.\" And He is a Father. And  with God the word father means mother too. Then what He _knows_ we need He  has _already planned_ to give. The great question for me then in praying  for some personal thing is this: Do _I_ know what _He_ knows I need? Am I  thinking about what He is thinking about for me?    And then remember that God is so much more in His loving planning than the  wisest, most loving father we know. Does a mother think into her child's  needs, the food, and clothing and the extras too, the luxuries? That is  God, only He is more loving and wiser than the best of us. I have  sometimes thought this: that if God were to say to me: \"I want to give you  something as a special love-gift; an extra because I love you: what would  you like to have?\" Do you know I have thought I would say, \"Dear God,  _you_ choose. _I_ choose what _you_ choose.\" He is thinking about me. He  knows what I am thinking of, and what I would most enjoy, and He is such a  lover-God that He would choose something Just a bit finer than I would  think. I might be thinking of a dollar, but likely as not He is thinking  of a double eagle. I am thinking of blackberries, big, juicy blackberries,  but really I do not know what blackberries are beside the sort He knows  and would choose for me. That is our God. Prayer does not and cannot  change the purpose of such a God. For every right and good thing we might  ask for He has already planned to give us. But prayer does change the  action of God. Because He cannot give against our wills, and our  willingness as expressed by our asking gives Him the opportunity to do as  He has already planned.        <u>The Greatest Prayer.</u>      There is a greatest prayer, _the_ greatest that can be offered. It is the  substratum of every true prayer. It is the undercurrent in the stream of  all Spirit-breathed prayer. Jesus Himself gives it to us in the only form  of prayer He left for our use. It is small in size, but mighty in power.  Four words--\"Thy will be done.\" Let us draw up our chairs, and _brew_ it  over mentally, that its strength and fragrance may come up into our  nostrils, and fill our very beings.    \"_Thy_\": That is God. On one side, He is wise, with all of the  intellectual strength, and keenness and poised judgment that that word  among men brings to us. On another side, He is strong, with all that that  word can imply of might and power irresistible. On still another side He  is good, pure, holy with the finest thought those words ever suggest to us  in those whom we know best, or in our dreams and visions. Then on a side  remaining, the tender personal side, He is--loving? No, that is quite  inadequate. He is _love_. Its personification is He. Now remember that we  do not know the meaning of those words. Our best definition and thought of  them, even in our dreams, when we let ourselves out, but hang around the  outskirts. The heart of them we do not know. Those words mean infinitely  more than we think. Their meaning is a projection along the lines of our  thought of them, but measurelessly beyond our highest reach.    And then, this God, wise, strong, good, and love, _is kin to us_. We  belong to Him.        \"We are His flock;      He doth us feed.      And for His sheep,      He doth us take.\"    We are His children by creation, and by a new creation in Jesus Christ. He  is ours, by His own act. That is the \"Thy\"--a God wise, strong, pure, who  is love, and who is a Father-mother-God, and is _our_ God.    \"Thy _will_.\" God's will is His desires, His purposes, that which He  wishes to occur, and that to which He gives His strength that it may  occur. The earth is His creation. Men are His children. Judging from wise  loving parents among men He has given Himself to thinking and studying and  planning for all men, and every man, and for the earth. His plan is the  most wise, pure, loving plan that can be thought of, _and more._ It takes  in the whole sweep of our lives, and every detail of them. Nothing escapes  the love-vigilance of our God.

Aytch,\" Maury Grays, First Tennessee Regiment (#7)"],[1," were whipped, fairly whipped, and according to all the  rules of war they ought to have retreated.  But they didn't.  Flushed  with their victories at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson and the capture of  Nashville, and the whole State of Tennessee having fallen into their  hands, victory was again to perch upon their banners, for Buell's army,  by forced marches, had come to Grant's assistance at the eleventh hour.    Gunboats and transports were busily crossing Buell's army all of Sunday  night.  We could hear their boats ringing their bells, and hear the puff  of smoke and steam from their boilers.  Our regiment was the advance  outpost, and we saw the skirmish line of the Federals advancing and then  their main line and then their artillery.  We made a good fight on Monday  morning, and I was taken by surprise when the order came for us to  retreat instead of advance.  But as I said before, reader, a private  soldier is but an automaton, and knows nothing of what is going on among  the generals, and I am only giving the chronicles of little things and  events that came under my own observation as I saw them then and remember  them now.  Should you desire to find out more about the battle, I refer  you to history.    One incident I recollect very well.  A Yankee colonel, riding a fine gray  mare, was sitting on his horse looking at our advance as if we were on  review.  W. H. rushed forward and grabbed his horse by the bridle,  telling him at the same time to surrender.  The Yankee seized the reins,  set himself back in the saddle, put the muzzle of his pistol in W. H.'s  face and fired.  About the time he pulled trigger, a stray ball from some  direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead, and his horse  becoming frightened, galloped off, dragging him through the Confederate  lines.  His pistol had missed its aim.    I have heard hundreds of old soldiers tell of the amount of greenback  money they saw and picked up on the battlefield of Shiloh, but they  thought it valueless and did not trouble themselves with bringing it off  with them.    One fellow, a courier, who had had his horse killed, got on a mule he had  captured, and in the last charge, before the final and fatal halt was  made, just charged right ahead by his lone self, and the soldiers said,  \"Just look at that brave man, charging right in the jaws of death.\"  He began to seesaw the mule and grit his teeth, and finally yelled out,  \"It arn't me, boys, it's this blarsted old mule.  Whoa!  Whoa!\"    On Monday morning I too captured me a mule.  He was not a fast mule,  and I soon found out that he thought he knew as much as I did.  He was  wise in his own conceit.  He had a propensity to take every hog path he  came to.  All the bombasting that I could give him would not make him  accelerate his speed.  If blood makes speed, I do not suppose he had a  drop of any kind in him.  If I wanted him to go on one side of the road  he was sure to be possessed of an equal desire to go on the other side.  Finally I and my mule fell out.  I got a big hickory and would frail  him over the head, and he would only shake his head and flop his ears,  and seem to say, \"Well, now, you think you are smart, don't you?\"  He was a resolute mule, slow to anger, and would have made an excellent  merchant to refuse bad pay, or I will pay your credit, for his whole  composition seemed to be made up the one word--no.  I frequently thought  it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule, and I would  gladly have done so if I could have gotten one-half of his no.  Me and  mule worried along until we came to a creek.  Mule did not desire to  cross, while I was trying to persuade him with a big stick, a rock in his  ear, and a twister on his nose.  The caisson of a battery was about to  cross.  The driver said, \"I'll take your mule over for you.\"  So he got a  large two-inch rope, tied one end around the mule's neck and the other to  the caisson, and ordered the driver to whip up.  The mule was loath to  take to the water.  He was no Baptist, and did not believe in immersion,  and had his views about crossing streams, but the rope began to tighten,  the mule to squeal out his protestations against such villainous  proceedings.  The rope, however, was stronger than the mule's \"no,\"  and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross  the creek.  On my taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say,  \"You think that you are mighty smart folks, but you are a leetle too  smart.\"  I gave it up that that mule's \"no\" was a little stronger than my  determination.  He seemed to be in deep meditation.  I got on him again,  when all of a sudden he lifted his head, pricked up his ears, began to  champ his bit, gave a little squeal, got a little faster, and finally  into a gallop and then a run.  He seemed all at once to have remembered  or to have forgotten something, and was now making up for lost time.  With all my pulling and seesawing and strength I could not stop him until  he brought up with me at Corinth, Mississippi.          CHAPTER III    CORINTH      Well, here we were, again \"reorganizing,\" and after our lax discipline  on the road to and from Virginia, and after a big battle, which always  disorganizes an army, what wonder is it that some men had to be shot,  merely for discipline's sake?  And what wonder that General Bragg's name  became a terror to deserters and evil doers?  Men were shot by scores,  and no wonder the army had to be reorganized.  Soldiers had enlisted for  twelve months only, and had faithfully complied with their volunteer  obligations; the terms for which they had enlisted had expired, and they  naturally looked upon it that they had a right to go home.  They had  done their duty faithfully and well.  They wanted to see their families;  in fact, wanted to go home anyhow.  War had become a reality; they were  tired of it.  A law had been passed by the Confederate States Congress  called the conscript act.  A soldier had no right to volunteer and to  choose the branch of service he preferred.  He was conscripted.    From this time on till the end of the war, a soldier was simply a machine,  a conscript.  It was mighty rough on rebels.  We cursed the war, we  cursed Bragg, we cursed the Southern Confederacy.  All our pride and  valor had gone, and we were sick of war and the Southern Confederacy.    A law was made by the Confederate States Congress about this time  allowing every person who owned twenty negroes to go home.  It gave us  the blues; we wanted twenty negroes.  Negro property suddenly became very  valuable, and there was raised the howl of \"rich man's war, poor man's  fight.\"  The glory of the war, the glory of the South, the glory and the  pride of our volunteers had no charms for the conscript.    We were directed to re-elect our officers, and the country was surprised  to see the sample of a conscript's choice.  The conscript had no choice.  He was callous, and indifferent whether he had a captain or not.  Those  who were at first officers had resigned and gone home, because they were  officers.  The poor private, a contemptible conscript, was left to howl  and gnash his teeth.  The war might as well have ended then and there.  The boys were \"hacked,\" nay, whipped.  They were shorn of the locks of  their glory.  They had but one ambition now, and that was to get out  of the army in some way or other.  They wanted to join the cavalry or  artillery or home guards or pioneer corps or to be \"yaller dogs,\" or  anything.    [The average staff officer and courier were always called \"yaller dogs,\"  and were regarded as non-combatants and a nuisance, and the average  private never let one pass without whistling and calling dogs.  In fact,  the general had to issue an army order threatening punishment for the  ridicule hurled at staff officers and couriers.  They were looked upon  as simply \"hangers on,\" or in other words, as yellow sheep-killing dogs,  that if you would say \"booh\" at, would yelp and get under their master's  heels.  Mike Snyder was General George Maney's \"yaller dog,\" and I  believe here is where Joe Jefferson, in Rip Van Winkle, got the name of  Rip's dog Snyder.  At all times of day or night you could hear, \"wheer,  hyat, hyat, haer, haer, hugh, Snyder, whoopee, hyat, whoopee, Snyder,  here, here,\" when a staff officer or courier happened to pass.  The  reason of this was that the private knew and felt that there was just  that much more loading, shooting and fighting for him; and there are the  fewest number of instances on record where a staff officer or courier  ever fired a gun in their country's cause; and even at this late day,  when I hear an old soldier telling of being on some general's staff,  I always think of the letter \"E.\"  In fact, later in the war I was  detailed as special courier and staff officer for General Hood, which  office I held three days.  But while I held the office in passing a guard  I always told them I was on Hood's staff, and ever afterwards I made  those three days' staff business last me the balance of the war.  I could  pass any guard in the army by using the magic words, \"staff officer.\"  It beat all the countersigns ever invented.  It was the \"open sesame\"  of war and discipline. ]    Their last hope had set.  They hated war.  To their minds the South was  a great tyrant, and the Confederacy a fraud.  They were deserting by  thousands.  They had no love or respect for General Bragg.  When men were  to be shot or whipped, the whole army was marched to the horrid scene to  see a poor trembling wretch tied to a post and a platoon of twelve men  drawn up in line to put him to death, and the hushed command of \"Ready,  aim, fire!\" would make the soldier, or conscript, I should say, loathe  the very name of Southern Confederacy.  And when some miserable wretch  was to be whipped and branded for being absent ten days without leave,  we had to see him kneel"]]]
