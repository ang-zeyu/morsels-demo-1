This damage to grapes would not, however, be much felt in  Guernsey, as all the grapes are protected by orchard-houses. But though  the grapes are protected, and most, if not all, the cherry orchards cut  down, still there is plenty of unprotected fruit in Guernsey to tempt  the Golden Oriole to remain in the Islands, and to bring the wrath and  the gun of the gardener both to bear upon him when he is there. This,  however, only shows that from the time spoken of by Mr. Metivier down to  the present time very few Golden Orioles could have visited Guernsey,  and still fewer remained to breed; for what with their fruit-eating  propensities and their bright plumage, hardly a bird could have escaped  being shot and subsequently making its appearance in the bird-stuffers'  windows, and affording a subject for a notice in the 'Star,' or some  other paper. I think therefore, on the whole, that though Guernsey still  affords many temptations to the Golden Oriole, and is sufficiently  well-wooded to afford shelter to suit its shy and suspicious habits, yet  for some reason or other the bird has not visited the Island of late  years even as an accidental visitant, or, if so, very rarely.    The Golden Oriole is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and marked as  having occurred in Guernsey and Sark, but nothing more is said about the  bird. Probably Guernsey was mentioned as a locality on account of the  female specimen in the Museum, but with this exception I have never  heard of its making its appearance in Sark even as a straggler.      21. DIPPER. _Cinclus aquaticus_, Bechstein. French, \"Aquassiere,\"  \"Cincle plongeur.\"--The Dipper or Water Ouzel, though not very common,  less so, indeed, than the Kingfisher, is nevertheless a resident  species, finding food all through the year in the clear pools left by  the tide, and also frequenting the few inland ponds, especially the  rather large ones, belonging to Mr. De Putron in the Vale, where there  is always a Dipper or a Kingfisher to be seen, though I do not think the  Dipper ever breeds about those ponds--in fact there is no place there  which would suit it; but though I have never found the nest myself in  Guernsey, I have been informed, especially by Mr. Gallienne, that the  Dipper makes use of some of the rocky bays, forming his nest amongst the  rocks as it would on the streams of Dartmoor and Exmoor.    Captain Hubboch, however, writes me word he saw one in Alderney in the  winter of 1861-62, and there seems no reason why a few should not remain  there throughout the year as in Guernsey.    All the Guernsey Dippers I have seen, including the two in the Museum,  which are probably Guernsey-killed, have been the common form, _Cinclus_  _aquations_. The dark-breasted form, _Cinclus melanogaster_, may occur  as an occasional wanderer, though the Channel Islands are somewhat out  of its usual range. There being no trout or salmon to be protected in  Guernsey, the Dipper has not to dread the persecution of wretched  keepers who falsely imagine that it must live entirely by the  destruction of salmon and trout ova, though the contrary has been proved  over and over again.    Professor Ansted includes the Dipper in his list, but only marks it as  occurring in Guernsey.      22. MISTLETOE THRUSH. _Turdus viscivorus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Merle  Draine,\" \"Grive Draine.\"--I quite agree with the remarks made by  Professor Newton, in his edition of 'Yarrell,' as to the proper English  name of the present species, and that it ought to be called the  Mistletoe Thrush. I am afraid, however, that the shorter appellation of  Missel Thrush will stick to this bird in spite of all attempts to the  contrary. In Guernsey the local name of the Mistletoe Thrush is \"Geai,\"  by which name Mr. Metivier mentions it in his 'Dictionary of Guernsey  and Norman French.' He also adds that the Jay does not exist in this  Island. This is to a certain extent confirmed by Mr. MacCulloch, who  says he is very doubtful as to the occurrence of the Jay in the Island,  and adds that the local name for the Mistletoe Thrush is \"Geai.\" Mr.  Gallienne, in a note to Professor Ansted's list, confirms the scarcity  of the Jay, as he says the Rook and the Jay are rarely seen here,  although they are indigenous to Jersey. The local name \"Geai\" may  perhaps have misled him as to the occasional appearance of the Jay. I  have never seen a real Jay in Guernsey myself.    As far as I am able to judge from occasional visits to the Island for  the last thirty years the Mistletoe Thrush has greatly increased in  numbers in Guernsey, especially within the last few years, and Mr.  MacCulloch and others who are resident in the Island quite agree with me  in this. I do not think its numbers are much increased at any time of  year by migrants, though a few foreigners may arrive in the autumn, at  which time of year considerable numbers of Mistletoe Thrushes are  brought into the Guernsey market, where they may be seen hanging in  bunches with Common Thrushes, Redwings, Blackbirds, Fieldfares,  Starlings, and an occasional Ring Ouzel. Fieldfares and Mistletoe  Thrushes usually sell at fourpence each, the rest at fourpence a couple.    Professor Ansted mentions it in his list, but confines it to Guernsey  and Sark. This is certainly not now the case, as I have seen it nearly  as numerous in Alderney and Herm as any of the other Islands. There is a  specimen in the Museum.      23. SONG THRUSH. _Turdus musicus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Grive,\" \"Merle  Grive.\"--Very common and resident in all the Islands, and great is the  destruction of snails by Thrushes and Blackbirds--in fact, nowhere have  I seen such destruction as in the Channel Islands, especially in  Guernsey and Herm, where every available stone seems made use of, and to  considerable purpose, to judge from the number of snail-shells to be  found about; and yet the gardeners complain quite as much of damage to  their gardens, especially in the fruit season, by Blackbirds and  Thrushes, as the English gardeners and seem equally unready to give  these birds any credit for the immense destruction of snails, which, if  left alone, would scarcely have left a green thing in the garden.    The local name of the Thrush is \"Mauvis.\" It is, of course, included in  Professor Ansted's list, but with the Fieldfare, Redwing, and Blackbird,  marked as only occurring in Guernsey and Sark. All these birds, however,  are equally common in Alderney, Herm, and Jethou. There is also a  specimen of each in the Museum.      24. REDWING. _Turdus iliacus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Grive mauvis,\" \"Merle  mauvis.\"--A regular and numerous winter visitant to all the Islands,  arriving about the end of October, and those that are not shot and  brought into the market departing again in March and April.      25. FIELDFARE. _Turdus pilaris_, Linnaeus. French, \"Grive litorne,\"  \"Merle litorne.\"--Like the Redwing, the Fieldfare is a regular and  numerous winter visitant, and arrives and departs about the same time.    When in Guernsey in November, 1871, I did not see either Redwings or  Fieldfares till a few days after my arrival on the 1st; after that both  species were numerous, and a few days later plenty of them might be seen  hanging up in the market with the Thrushes and Blackbirds, but for the  first few days there were none to be seen there. Probably this was  rather a late year, as neither bird could have arrived in any numbers  till the first week in November, and in all probability not till towards  the end of the week.      26. BLACKBIRD. _Turdus merula_, Linnaeus. French, \"Merle noir.\"--- The  Blackbird is a common and numerous resident in all the Islands in the  Bailiwick of Guernsey. The Guernsey gardeners, like their brethren in  England, make a great fuss about the mischief done by Blackbirds in the  gardens, and no doubt Blackbirds, like the Golden Orioles, are \"grand  gobeurs\" of many kinds of fruit; but the gardeners should remember that  they are equally \"grand gobeurs\" of many kinds of insects as well, many  of the most mischievous insects to the garden, including wasps (I have  myself several times found wasps in the stomach of the blackbird)  forming a considerable portion of their food, the young also being  almost entirely fed upon worms, caterpillars, and grubs; and when we  remember that it is only for a short time of the year that the Blackbird  can feed on fruit, which in most cases can be protected by a little  care, and that during the whole of the other portion of the year it  feeds on insects which would do more damage in the garden than itself,  it will be apparent that the gardener has really no substantial ground  of complaint.    As in England, variations in the plumage of the Blackbird are not  uncommon. I have one Guernsey specimen of a uniform fawn colour, and  another rather curiously marked with grey, the tail-feathers being  striped across grey and black. This is a young bird recently out of the  nest, and I have no doubt would, after a moult or two, have come to its  proper plumage, probably after the first moult, as seems to me  frequently the case with varieties of this sort, though I have known a  Blackbird show a good deal af white year after year in the winter,  resuming its proper plumage in the summer; and Mr. Jago mentions a case  of a Blackbird which passed through his hands which was much marked  with grey. This bird was found dead, and the owner of the estate on  which it was found informed Mr. Jago that it had frequented his place  for four years, and that he had seen it with its mate during the summer;  so in this case the variation certainly seems to have been permanent.      27. RING OUZEL. _Turdus torquatus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Merle a  plastron.\"--I do not think the Ring Ouzel is ever as common in the  Channel Islands as it is on migration in South Devon. A few,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#7)"],[1," we can  make it, without difficulty, assume the form of a liquid.          LECTURE III.    PRODUCTS: WATER FROM THE COMBUSTION--NATURE OF WATER--A  COMPOUND--HYDROGEN.      I dare say you will remember that when we parted we had just mentioned the  word \"products\" from the candle. For when a candle burns we found we were  able, by nice adjustment, to get various products from it. There was one  substance which was not obtained when the candle was burning properly,  which was charcoal or smoke; and there was some other substance that went  upwards from the flame which did not appear as smoke, but took some other  form, and made part of that general current which, ascending from the  candle upwards, becomes invisible, and escapes. There were also other  products to mention. You remember that in that rising current having its  origin at the candle, we found that one part was condensable against a  cold spoon, or against a clean plate, or any other cold thing, and another  part was incondensable.    We will first take the condensable part, and examine it; and, strange to  say, we find that that part of the product is just water--nothing but  water. On the last occasion I spoke of it incidentally, merely saying that  water was produced among the condensable products of the candle; but  to-day I wish to draw your attention to water, that we may examine it  carefully, especially in relation to this subject, and also with respect  to its general existence on the surface of the globe.    Now, having previously arranged an experiment for the purpose of  condensing water from the products of the candle, my next point will be to  shew you this water; and perhaps one of the best means that I can adopt  for shewing its presence to so many at once, is to exhibit a very visible  action of water, and then to apply that test to what is collected as a  drop at the bottom of that vessel. I have here a chemical substance,  discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy, which has a very energetic action upon  water, which I shall use as a test of the presence of water. If I take a  little piece of it--it is called potassium, as coming from potash,--if I  take a little piece of it, and throw it into that basin, you see how it  shews the presence of water by lighting up and floating about, burning  with a violent flame. I am now going to take away the candle which has  been burning beneath the vessel containing ice and salt, and you see a  drop of water--a condensed product of the candle--hanging from under the  surface of the dish.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    I will shew you that potassium has the same action upon it as upon the  water in that basin in the experiment we have just tried. See, it takes  fire, and burns in just the same manner. I will take another drop upon  this glass slab, and when I put the potassium on to it, you see at once,  from its taking fire, that there is water present. Now, that water was  produced by the candle. In the same manner, if I put this spirit-lamp  under that jar, you will soon see the latter become damp, from the dew  which is deposited upon it--that dew being the result of combustion; and I  have no doubt you will shortly see by the drops of water which fall upon  the paper below, that there is a good deal of water produced from the  combustion of the lamp. I will let it remain, and you can afterwards see  how much water has been collected. So, if I take a gas-lamp, and put any  cooling arrangement over it, I shall get water--water being likewise  produced from the combustion of gas. Here, in this bottle, is a quantity  of water--perfectly pure, distilled water, produced from the combustion of  a gas-lamp--in no point different from the water that you distil from the  river, or ocean, or spring, but exactly the same thing. Water is one  individual thing--it never changes. We can add to it by careful  adjustment, for a little while, or we can take it apart, and get other  things from it; but water, as water, remains always the same, either in a  solid, liquid, or fluid state. Here, again [holding another bottle], is  some water produced by the combustion of an oil-lamp. A pint of oil, when  burnt fairly and properly, produces rather more than a pint of water.  Here, again, is some water, produced by a rather long experiment from a  wax candle. And so we can go on with almost all combustible substances,  and find that if they burn with a flame, as a candle, they produce water.  You may make these experiments yourselves. The head of a poker is a very  good thing to try with, and if it remains cold long enough over the  candle, you may get water condensed in drops on it; or a spoon or ladle,  or anything else may be used, provided it be clean, and can carry off the  heat, and so condense the water.    And now--to go into the history of this wonderful production of water from  combustibles, and by combustion--I must first of all tell you that this  water may exist in different conditions; and although you may now be  acquainted with all its forms, they still require us to give a little  attention to them for the present, so that we may perceive how the water,  whilst it goes through its Protean changes, is entirely and absolutely the  same thing, whether it is produced from a candle, by combustion, or from  the rivers or ocean.    First of all, water, when at the coldest, is ice. Now, we philosophers---I  hope that I may class you and myself together in this case--speak of water  as water, whether it be in its solid, or liquid, or gaseous state,--we  speak of it chemically as water. Water is a thing compounded of two  substances, one of which we have derived from the candle, and the other we  shall find elsewhere. Water may occur as ice; and you have had most  excellent opportunities lately of seeing this. Ice changes back into  water--for we had on our last Sabbath a strong instance of this change, by  the sad catastrophe which occurred in our own house, as well as in the  houses of many of our friends,--ice changes back into water when the  temperature is raised: water also changes into steam when it is warmed  enough. The water which we have here before us is in its densest  state[11], and although it changes in weight, in condition, in form, and  in many other qualities, it still is water; and whether we alter it into  ice by cooling, or whether we change it into steam by heat, it increases  in volume,--in the one case very strangely and powerfully, and in the  other case very largely and wonderfully. For instance, I will now take  this tin cylinder, and pour a little water into it; and seeing how much  water I pour in, you may easily estimate for yourselves how high it will  rise in the vessel: it will cover the bottom about two inches. I am now  about to convert the water into steam, for the purpose of shewing to you  the different volumes which water occupies in its different states of  water and steam.    Let us now take the case of water changing into ice: we can effect that by  cooling it in a mixture of salt and pounded ice[12]; and I shall do so to  shew you the expansion of water into a thing of larger bulk when it is so  changed. These bottles [holding one] are made of strong cast iron, very  strong and very thick--I suppose they are the third of an inch in  thickness; they are very carefully filled with water, so as to exclude all  air, and then they are screwed down tight. We shall see that when we  freeze the water in these iron vessels, they will not be able to hold the  ice, and the expansion within them will break them in pieces as these  [pointing to some fragments] are broken, which have been bottles of  exactly the same kind. I am about to put these two bottles into that  mixture of ice and salt, for the purpose of shewing that when water  becomes ice, it changes in volume in this extraordinary way.    In the mean time look at the change which has taken place in the water to  which we have applied heat--it is losing its fluid state. You may tell  this by two or three circumstances. I have covered the mouth of this glass  flask, in which water is boiling, with a watch-glass. Do you see what  happens? It rattles away like a valve chattering, because the steam rising  from the boiling water sends the valve up and down, and forces itself out,  and so makes it clatter. You can very easily perceive that the flask is  quite full of steam, or else it would not force its way out. You see,  also, that the flask contains a substance very much larger than the water,  for it fills the whole of the flask over and over again, and there it is  blowing away into the air; and yet you cannot observe any great diminution  in the bulk of the water, which shews you that its change of bulk is very  great when it becomes steam.    I have put our iron bottles containing water into this freezing mixture,  that you may see what happens. No communication will take place, you  observe, between the water in the bottles and the ice in the outer vessel.  But there will be a conveyance of heat from the one to the other; and if  we are successful--we are making our experiment in very great haste--I  expect you will by-and-by, so soon as the cold has taken possession of the  bottles and their contents, hear a pop on the occasion of the bursting of  the one bottle or the other; and, when we come to examine the bottles, we  shall find their contents masses of ice, partly enclosed by the covering  of iron which is too small for them, because the ice is larger in bulk  than the water. You know very well that ice floats upon water: if a boy  falls through a hole into the water, he tries to get on the ice again to  float him up. Why does the ice float?--think of that, and philosophise.  Because the ice is larger than the quantity of water which can produce it;  and therefore the ice weighs the lighter, and the water is the heavier.    To return now to the action of heat on water.
