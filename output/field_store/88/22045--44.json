The father is  out of work.\"    \"Knowest thou what, mother,\" put in Fanny. \"Suppose we give them our  soup. Aunt Leah has just fetched it for us. Have we not a special supper  to-night?\"    \"But father?\" murmured the little woman dubiously.    \"Oh, he won't notice it. I don't think he knows the soup kitchen opens  to-night. Let me, mother.\"    And Fanny, letting Pesach's hand go, slipped out to the room that served  as a kitchen, and bore the still-steaming pot upstairs. Pesach, who had  pursued her, followed with some hunks of bread and a piece of lighted  candle, which, while intended only to illumine the journey, came in  handy at the terminus. And the festive company grinned and winked when  the pair disappeared, and made jocular quotations from the Old Testament  and the Rabbis. But the lovers did not kiss when they came out of the  garret of the Ansells; their eyes were wet, and they went softly  downstairs hand in hand, feeling linked by a deeper love than before.    Thus did Providence hand over the soup the Belcovitches took from old  habit to a more necessitous quarter, and demonstrate in double sense  that Charity never faileth. Nor was this the only mulct which Providence  exacted from the happy father, for later on a townsman of his appeared  on the scene in a long capote, and with a grimy woe-begone expression.  He was a \"greener\" of the greenest order, having landed at the docks  only a few hours ago, bringing over with him a great deal of luggage in  the shape of faith in God, and in the auriferous character of London  pavements. On arriving in England, he gave a casual glance at the  metropolis and demanded to be directed to a synagogue wherein to shake  himself after the journey. His devotions over, he tracked out Mr.  Kosminski, whose address on a much-creased bit of paper had been his  talisman of hope during the voyage. In his native town, where the Jews  groaned beneath divers and sore oppressions, the fame of Kosminski, the  pioneer, the Croesus, was a legend. Mr. Kosminski was prepared for these  contingencies. He went to his bedroom, dragged out a heavy wooden chest  from under the bed, unlocked it and plunged his hand into a large dirty  linen bag, full of coins. The instinct of generosity which was upon him  made him count out forty-eight of them. He bore them to the \"greener\" in  over-brimming palms and the foreigner, unconscious how much he owed to  the felicitous coincidence of his visit with Fanny's betrothal, saw  fortune visibly within his grasp. He went out, his heart bursting with  gratitude, his pocket with four dozen farthings. They took him in and  gave him hot soup at a Poor Jews' Shelter, whither his townsman had  directed him. Kosminski returned to the banqueting room, thrilling from  head to foot with the approval of his conscience. He patted Becky's  curly head and said:    \"Well, Becky, when shall we be dancing at your wedding?\"    Becky shook her curls. Her young men could not have a poorer opinion of  one another than Becky had of them all. Their homage pleased her, though  it did not raise them in her esteem. Lovers grew like blackberries--only  more so; for they were an evergreen stock. Or, as her mother put it in  her coarse, peasant manner. _Chasanim_ were as plentiful as the  street-dogs. Becky's beaux sat on the stairs before she was up and  became early risers in their love for her, each anxious to be the first  to bid their Penelope of the buttonholes good morrow. It was said that  Kosminski's success as a \"sweater\" was due to his beauteous Becky, the  flower of sartorial youth gravitating to the work-room of this East  London Laban. What they admired in Becky was that there was so much of  her. Still it was not enough to go round, and though Becky might keep  nine lovers in hand without fear of being set down as a flirt, a larger  number of tailors would have been less consistent with prospective  monogamy.    \"I'm not going to throw myself away like Fanny,\" said she confidentially  to Pesach Weingott in the course of the evening. He smiled  apologetically. \"Fanny always had low views,\" continued Becky. \"But I  always said I would marry a gentleman.\"    \"And I dare say,\" answered Pesach, stung into the retort, \"Fanny could  marry a gentlemen, too, if she wanted.\"    Becky's idea of a gentleman was a clerk or a school-master, who had no  manual labor except scribbling or flogging. In her matrimonial views  Becky was typical. She despised the status of her parents and looked to  marry out of it. They for their part could not understand the desire to  be other than themselves.    \"I don't say Fanny couldn't,\" she admitted. \"All I say is, nobody could  call this a luck-match.\"    \"Ah, thou hast me too many flies in thy nose,\" reprovingly interposed  Mrs. Belcovitch, who had just crawled up. \"Thou art too high-class.\"    Becky tossed her head. \"I've got a new dolman,\" she said, turning to one  of her young men who was present by special grace. \"You should see me in  it. I look noble.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch proudly. \"It shines in the sun.\"    \"Is it like the one Bessie Sugarman's got?\" inquired the young man.    \"Bessie Sugarman!\" echoed Becky scornfully. \"She gets all her things  from the tallyman. She pretends to be so grand, but all her jewelry is  paid for at so much a week.\"    \"So long as it is paid for,\" said Fanny, catching the words and turning  a happy face on her sister.    \"Not so jealous, Alte,\" said her mother. \"When I shall win on the  lottery, I will buy thee also a dolman.\"    Almost all the company speculated on the Hamburg lottery, which, whether  they were speaking Yiddish or English, they invariably accentuated on  the last syllable. When an inhabitant of the Ghetto won even his money  back, the news circulated like wild-fire, and there was a rush to the  agents for tickets. The chances of sudden wealth floated like dazzling  Will o' the Wisps on the horizon, illumining the gray perspectives of  the future. The lottery took the poor ticket-holders out of themselves,  and gave them an interest in life apart from machine-cotton, lasts or  tobacco-leaf. The English laborer, who has been forbidden State  Lotteries, relieves the monotony of existence by an extremely indirect  interest in the achievements of a special breed of horses.    \"_Nu_, Pesach, another glass of rum,\" said Mr. Belcovitch genially to  his future son-in-law and boarder.    \"Yes, I will,\" said Pesach. \"After all, this is the first time I've got  engaged.\"    The rum was of Mr. Belcovitch's own manufacture; its ingredients were  unknown, but the fame of it travelled on currents of air to the remotest  parts of the house. Even the inhabitants of the garrets sniffed and  thought of turpentine. Pesach swallowed the concoction, murmuring \"To  life\" afresh. His throat felt like the funnel of a steamer, and there  were tears in his eyes when he put down the glass.    \"Ah, that was good,\" he murmured.    \"Not like thy English drinks, eh?\" said Mr. Belcovitch.    \"England!\" snorted Pesach in royal disdain. \"What a country! Daddle-doo  is a language and ginger-beer a liquor.\"    \"Daddle doo\" was Pesach's way of saying \"That'll do.\" It was one of the  first English idioms he picked up, and its puerility made him facetious.  It seemed to smack of the nursery; when a nation expressed its soul  thus, the existence of a beverage like ginger-beer could occasion no  further surprise.    \"You shan't have anything stronger than ginger-beer when we're married,\"  said Fanny laughingly. \"I am not going to have any drinking.'\"    \"But I'll get drunk on ginger-beer,\" Pesach laughed back.    \"You can't,\" Fanny said, shaking her large fond smile to and fro. \"By my  health, not.\"    \"Ha! Ha! Ha! Can't even get _shikkur_ on it. What a liquor!\"    In the first Anglo-Jewish circles with which Pesach had scraped  acquaintance, ginger-beer was the prevalent drink; and, generalizing  almost as hastily as if he were going to write a book on the country, he  concluded that it was the national beverage. He had long since  discovered his mistake, but the drift of the discussion reminded Becky  of a chance for an arrow.    \"On the day when you sit for joy, Pesach,\" she said slily. \"I shall send  you a valentine.\"    Pesach colored up and those in the secret laughed; the reference was to  another of Pesach's early ideas. Some mischievous gossip had heard him  arguing with another Greener outside a stationer's shop blazing with  comic valentines. The two foreigners were extremely puzzled to  understand what these monstrosities portended; Pesach, however, laid it  down that the microcephalous gentlemen with tremendous legs, and the  ladies five-sixths head and one-sixth skirt, were representations of the  English peasants who lived in the little villages up country.    \"When I sit for joy,\" retorted Pesach, \"it will not be the season for  valentines.\"    \"Won't it though!\" cried Becky, shaking her frizzly black curls. \"You'll  be a pair of comic 'uns.\"    \"All right, Becky,\" said Alte good-humoredly. \"Your turn'll come, and  then we shall have the laugh of you.\"    \"Never,\" said Becky. \"What do I want with a man?\"    The arm of the specially invited young man was round her as she spoke.    \"Don't make _schnecks_,\" said Fanny.    \"It's not affectation. I mean it. What's the good of the men who visit  father? There isn't a gentleman among them.\"    \"Ah, wait till I win on the lottery,\" said the special young man.    \"Then, vy not take another eighth of a ticket?\" inquired Sugarman the  _Shadchan_, who seemed to spring from the other end of the room. He was  one of the greatest Talmudists in London--a lean, hungry-looking man,  sharp of feature and acute of intellect. \"Look at Mrs. Robinson--I've  just won her over twenty pounds, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1271"],[0,"Bygone Beliefs: Being a Series of Excursions in the Byways of Thought (#7)"],[1,"for their food, the omen was of a  most direful nature. On the other hand, if from the greediness of the  chickens the grain fell from their beaks and rebounded from the  ground, the augury was most favourable. This latter augury was known as  _tripudium solistimum_. \"Any fraud practiced by the 'pullarius',\" writes  the Rev. EDWARD SMEDLEY, \"reverted to his own head. Of this we have a  memorable instance in the great battle between Papirius Cursor and the  Samnites in the year of Rome 459. So anxious were the troops for battle,  that the 'pullarius' dared to announce to the consul a 'tripudium  solistimum,' although the chickens refused to eat. Papirius  unhesitatingly gave the signal for fight, when his son, having  discovered the false augury, hastened to communicate it to his father.  'Do thy part well,' was his reply, 'and let the deceit of the augur fall  on himself. The \"tripudium\" has been announced to me, and no omen could  be better for the Roman army and people!' As the troops advanced, a  javelin thrown at random struck the 'pullatius' dead. 'The hand of  heaven is in the battle,' cried Papirius; 'the guilty is punished!' and  he advanced and conquered.\"(1b) A coincidence of this sort, if it really  occurred, would very greatly strengthen the popular belief in auguries.

EDWARD SMEDLEY, M.A.: _The Occult Sciences_ (_Encyclopaedia  Metropolitana_), ed. by ELIHU RICH (1855), p. 144.      The _cock_ has always been reckoned a bird possessed of magic power. At  its crowing, we are told, all unquiet spirits who roam the earth  depart to their dismal abodes, and the orgies of the Witches' Sabbath  terminate. A cock is the favourite sacrifice offered to evil spirits  in Ceylon and elsewhere. Alectromancy(2) was an ancient and peculiarly  senseless method of divination (so called) in which a cock was employed.  The bird had to be young and quite white. Its feet were cut off and  crammed down its throat with a piece of parchment on which were written  certain Hebrew words. The cock, after the repetition of a prayer by the  operator, was placed in a circle divided into parts corresponding to the  letters of the alphabet, in each of which a grain of wheat was placed.  A certain psalm was recited, and then the letters were noted from which  the cock picked up the grains, a fresh grain being put down for each  one picked up. These letters, properly arranged, were said to give the  answer to the inquiry for which divination was made. I am not sure what  one was supposed to do if, as seems likely, the cock refused to act in  the required manner.      (2) Cf. ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _The Occult Sciences_ (1891), pp. 124 and  125.      The _owl_ was reckoned a bird of evil omen with the Romans, who derived  this opinion from the Etrurians, along with much else of their so-called  science of augury. It was particularly dreaded if seen in a city, or,  indeed, anywhere by day. PLINY (Caius Plinius Secundus, A.D. 61-before  115) informs us that on one occasion \"a horned owl entered the very  sanctuary of the Capitol;... in consequence of which, Rome was purified  on the nones of March in that year.\"(1)      (1) PLINY: _Natural History_, bk. x. chap. xvi. (BOSTOCK and RILEY'S  trans., vol. ii., 1855, p. 492).      The folk-lore of the British Isles abounds with quaint beliefs and  stories concerning birds. There is a charming Welsh legend concerning  the _robin_, which the Rev. T. F. T. DYER quotes from _Notes and  Queries_:--\"Far, far away, is a land of woe, darkness, spirits of evil,  and fire. Day by day does this little bird bear in his bill a drop of  water to quench the flame. So near the burning stream does he fly,  that his dear little feathers are SCORCHED; and hence he is named  Brou-rhuddyn (Breast-burnt). To serve little children, the robin  dares approach the infernal pit. No good child will hurt the devoted  benefactor of man. The robin returns from the land of fire, and  therefore he feels the cold of winter far more than his brother birds.  He shivers in the brumal blast; hungry, he chirps before your door.\"(2)      (2) T. F. THISELTON DYER, M.A.: _English Folk-Lore_ (1878), pp. 65 and  66.      Another legend accounts for the robin's red breast by supposing this  bird to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow  of the crucified CHRIST, in order to alleviate His sufferings. No doubt  it is on account of these legends that it is considered a crime, which  will be punished with great misfortune, to kill a robin. In some places  the same prohibition extends to the _wren_, which is popularly believed  to be the wife of the robin. In other parts, however, the wren is (or  at least was) cruelly hunted on certain days. In the Isle of Man the  wren-hunt took place on Christmas Eve and St Stephen's Day, and is  accounted for by a legend concerning an evil fairy who lured many men to  destruction, but had to assume the form of a wren to escape punishment  at the hands of an ingenious knight-errant.    For several centuries there was prevalent over the whole of civilised  Europe a most extraordinary superstition concerning the small Arctic  bird resembling, but not so large as, the common wild goose, known as  the _barnacle_ or _bernicle goose_. MAX MUELLER(1) has suggested that  this word was really derived from _Hibernicula_, the name thus referring  to Ireland, where the birds were caught; but common opinion associated  the barnacle goose with the shell-fish known as the barnacle (which  is found on timber exposed to the sea), supposing that the former was  generated out of the latter. Thus in one old medical writer we find:  \"There are founde in the north parts of Scotland, and the Ilands  adjacent, called Orchades (Orkney Islands), certain trees, whereon  doe growe certaine shell fishes, of a white colour tending to russet;  wherein are conteined little liuing creatures: which shells in time of  maturitie doe open, and out of them grow those little living things;  which falling into the water, doe become foules, whom we call  Barnakles... but the other that do fall vpon the land, perish and come  to nothing: this much by the writings of others, and also from the  mouths of the people of those parts....\"(1b)      (1) See F. MAX MUELLER'S _Lectures on the Science of Language_ (1885),  where a very full account of the tradition concerning the origin of the  barnacle goose will be found.    (1b) JOHN GERARDE: _The Herball; or, Generall Historie of Plantes_  (1597). 1391.      The writer, however, who was a well-known surgeon and botanist of  his day, adds that he had personally examined certain shell-fish from  Lancashire, and on opening the shells had observed within birds in  various stages of development. No doubt he was deceived by some purely  superficial resemblances--for example, the feet of the barnacle fish  resemble somewhat the feathers of a bird. He gives an imaginative  illustration of the barnacle fowl escaping from its shell, which is  reproduced in fig. 12.    Turning now from superstitions concerning actual birds to legends of  those that are purely mythical, passing reference must be made to the  _roc_, a bird existing in Arabian legend, which we meet in the _Arabian  Nights_, and which is chiefly remarkable for its size and strength.    The _phoenix_, perhaps, is of more interest. Of \"that famous bird of  Arabia,\" PLINY writes as follows, prefixing his description of it with  the cautious remark, \"I am not quite sure that its existence is not all  a fable.\" \"It is said that there is only one in existence in the whole  world, and that that one has not been seen very often. We are told that  this bird is of the size of an eagle, and has a brilliant golden plumage  around the neck, while the rest of the body is of a purple colour;  except the tail, which is azure, with long feathers intermingled of a  roseate hue; the throat is adorned with a crest, and the head with a  tuft of feathers. The first Roman who described this bird... was the  senator Manilius.... He tells us that no person has ever seen this bird  eat, that in Arabia it is looked upon as sacred to the sun, that it  lives five hundred and forty years, that when it becomes old it builds a  nest of cassia and sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and  then lays its body down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow  there springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time changes  into a little bird; that the first thing that it does is to perform the  obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the nest entire to the city  of the Sun near Panchaia, and there deposit it upon the altar of that  divinity.    \"The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the great year  is completed with the life of this bird, and that then a new cycle comes  round again with the same characteristics as the former one, in the  seasons and the appearance of the stars. ... This bird was brought to  Rome in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius... and was exposed to  public view.... This fact is attested by the public Annals, but there is  no one that doubts that it was a fictitious phoenix only.\"(1)      (1) PLINY: _Natural History_, bk. x. chap. ii. (BOSTOCK and RILEY'S  trans., vol. ii., 1855, PP. 479-481).      The description of the plumage, _etc_., of this bird applies fairly  well, as CUVIER has pointed out,(2) to the golden pheasant, and a  specimen of the latter may have been the \"fictitious phoenix\"  referred to above. That this bird should have been credited with the  extraordinary and wholly fabulous properties related by PLINY and others  is not, however, easy to understand. The phoenix was frequently used  to illustrate the doctrine of the immortality of the soul (_e.g_. in  CLEMENT'S _First Epistle to the Corinthians_), and it is not impossible  that originally it was nothing "]]]
