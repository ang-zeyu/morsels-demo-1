He had not dreamed that the Old Man would be capable of such  an action, even with the latest and least-valued comer; he felt the  sting of it, the injustice and the ingratitude for all the years he  had given the Double-Crank. It seemed to him that he could never feel  quite the same toward another outfit, or be content riding horses  which bore some other brand.    \"I suppose you are quite familiar with raising cattle under these  Western conditions,\" Alexander P. Dill ventured, after a season of  mutual meditation.    \"Kinda,\" Billy confirmed briefly.    \"There seems to be a certain class-prejudice against strangers, out  here. I can't understand it and I can't seem to get away from it. I  believe those men deliberately misinformed me, for the sole reason  that I am unfortunately a stranger and unfamiliar with the country.  They do not seem to realize that this country must eventually be more  fully developed, and that, in the very nature of things, strangers  are sure to come and take advantage of the natural resources and  aid materially in their development. I don't consider myself an  interloper; I came here with the intention of making this my future  home, and of putting every dollar of capital that I possess into this  country; I wish I had more. I like the country; it isn't as if I came  here to take something away. I came to add my mite; to help build up,  not to tear down. And I can't understand the attitude of men who would  maliciously--\"    \"It's kinda got to be part uh the scenery to josh a pilgrim,\" Billy  took the trouble to explain. \"We don't mean any harm. I reckon you'll  get along all right, once yuh get wised up.\"    \"Do you expect to be in town for any length of time?\" Mr. Dill's voice  was wistful, as well as his eyes. \"Somehow, you don't seem to adopt  that semi-hostile attitude, and I--I'm very glad for the opportunity  of knowing you.\"    Charming Billy made a rapid mental calculation of his present  financial resources and of past experience in the rate of depletion.    \"Well. I may last a week or so, and I might pull out to-morrow,\" he  decided candidly. \"It all depends on the kinda luck I have.\"    Mr. Dill looked at him inquiringly, but he made no remark that would  betray curiosity. \"I have rented a room in a little house in the  quietest part of town. The hotel isn't very clean and there is too  much noise and drinking going on at night. I couldn't sleep there.  I should be glad to have you share my room with me while you stay in  town, if you will. It is clean and quiet.\"    Charming Billy turned his head and looked at him queerly; at his  sloping shoulders, melancholy face and round, wistful eyes, and  finally at the awkward, hunched-up knees of him. Billy did not mind  night noises and drinking--to be truthful, they were two of the  allurements which had brought him townward--and whether a room were  clean or not troubled him little; he would not see much of it. His  usual procedure while in town would, he suspected, seem very loose to  Alexander P. Dill. It consisted chiefly of spending the nights  where the noise clamored loudest and of sleeping during the  day--sometimes--where was the most convenient spot to lay the length  of him. He smiled whimsically at the contrast between them and their  habits of living.    \"Much obliged,\" he said. \"I expect to be some busy, but maybe I'll  drop in and bed down with yuh; once I hit town, it's hard to tell what  I may do.\"    \"I hope you'll feel perfectly free to come at any time and make  yourself at home,\" Mr. Dill urged lonesomely.    \"Sure. There's the old burg--I do plumb enjoy seeing the sun making  gold on a lot uh town windows, like that over there. It sure looks  good, when you've been living by your high lonesome and not seeing any  window shine but your own little six-by-eight. Huh?\"    \"I--I must admit I like better to see the sunset turn my own windows  to gold,\" observed Mr. Dill softly. \"I haven't any, now; I sold the  old farm when mother died. I was born and raised there. The woods  pasture was west of the house, and every evening when I drove up the  cows, and the sun was setting, the kitchen windows--\"    Alexander P. Dill stopped very abruptly, and Billy, stealing a glance  at his face, turned his own quickly away and gazed studiously at a  bald hilltop off to the left. So finely tuned was his sympathy that  for one fleeting moment he saw a homely, hilly farm in Michigan, with  rail fences and a squat old house with wide porch and hard-beaten path  from the kitchen door to the well and on to the stables; and down a  long slope that was topped with great old trees, Alexander P.  Dill shambling contentedly, driving with a crooked stick three  mild-mannered old cows. \"The blamed chump--what did he go and pull  out for?\" he asked himself fretfully. Then aloud: \"I'm going to have  a heart-to-heart talk with the cook at the hotel, and if he don't give  us a real old round-up beefsteak, flopped over on the bare stovelids,  there'll be things happen I'd hate to name over. He can sure do the  business, all right; he used to cook for the Double-Crank. And you,\"  he turned, elaborately cheerful, to Mr. Dill, \"you are my guest.\"    \"Thank you,\" smiled Mr. Dill, recovering himself and never guessing  how strange was the last sentence to the lips of Charming Billy Boyle.  \"I shall be very glad to be the guest of somebody--once more.\"    \"Yuh poor old devil, yuh sure drifted a long ways off your home  range,\" mused Billy. Out loud he only emphasized the arrangement with:    \"Sure thing!\"          CHAPTER VI.    \"_That's My Dill Pickle!_\"      Charming Billy Boyle was, to put it mildly, enjoying his enforced  vacation very much. To tell the plain truth and tell it without the  polish of fiction, he was hilariously moistened as to his gullet and  he was not thinking of quitting yet; he had only just begun.    He was sitting on an end of the bar in the Hardtip Saloon, his hat as  far back on his head as it could possibly be pushed with any hope of  its staying there at all. He had a glass in one hand, a cigarette in  the other, and he was raking his rowels rhythmically up and down the  erstwhile varnished bar in buzzing accompaniment, the while he chanted  with much enthusiasm:         \"How old is she, Billy boy, Billy boy?       How old is she, charming Billy?         Twice six, twice seven,         Forty-nine and eleven--\"    The bartender, wiping the bar after an unsteady sheepherder, was  careful to leave a generous margin around the person of Charming Billy  who was at that moment asserting with much emphasis:         \"She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother.\"    \"Twice-six's-twelve, 'n' twice-seven's-four-r-teen, 'n' twelve 'n'  fourteen's--er--twelve--'n'--fourteen--\" The unsteady sheepherder was  laboring earnestly with the problem. \"She ain't no spring chicken, she  ain't!\" He laughed tipsily, and winked up at the singer, but Billy was  not observing him and his mathematical struggles. He refreshed himself  from the glass, leaving the contents perceptibly lower--it was a  large, thick glass with a handle, and it had flecks of foam down the  inside--took a pull at the cigarette and inquired plaintively:         \"Can she brew, can she bake, Billy boy, Billy boy?       Can she brew, can she bake, charming Billy?\"    Another long pull at the cigarette, and then the triumphant  declaration:         \"She can brew n' she can bake,       She can sew n' she can make--       She's a young thing, and cannot leave her mother.\"    \"She ain't s' young!\" bawled the sheepherder, who was taking it all  very seriously. \"Say them numbers over again, onc't. Twelve-'n'-fourteen--\"    \"Aw, go off and lay down!\" advised Charming Billy, in a tone of deep  disgust. He was about to pursue still farther his inquiry into the  housewifely qualifications of the mysterious \"young thing,\" and he  hated interruptions.         \"Can she make a punkin pie, Billy boy, Billy boy?       Can she make a punkin pie, charming Billy?\"    The door opened timidly and closed again, but he did not see who  entered. He was not looking; he was holding the empty, foam-flecked  glass behind him imperatively, and he was watching over his shoulder  to see that the bartender did not skimp the filling and make it  two-thirds foam. The bartender was punctiliously lavish, so that a  crest of foam threatened to deluge the hand of Charming Billy and  quite occupied him for the moment. When he squared himself again and  buzzed his spurs against the bar, his mind was wholly given to the  proper execution of the musical gem.         \"She can make a punkin pie,       Quick's a cat can wink her eye--\"    Something was going on, over in the dimly lighted corner near the  door. Half a dozen men had grouped themselves there with their backs  to Billy and they were talking and laughing; but the speech of them  was an unintelligible clamor and their laughter a commingling roar.  Billy gravely inspected his cigarette, which had gone cold, set down  the glass and sought diligently for a match.    \"Aw, come on an' have one on me!\" bawled a voice peremptorily. \"Yuh  can't raise no wild cattle around _this_ joint, lessen yuh wet up good  with whisky. Why, a feller as long as you be needs a good jolt for  every foot of yuh--and that's about fifteen when you're lengthened  out good. Come on--don't be a damn' chubber! Yuh got to sample m'  hospitality. Hey, Tom! set out about a quart uh your _mildest_ for  Daffy-down-Dilly. He's dry, clean down to his hand-made socks.\"    Charming Billy, having found a match, held it unlighted in his fingers  and watched the commotion from his perch on the bar. In the very midst  of the clamor towered the melancholy Alexander P. Dill, and he was  endeavoring to explain, in his quiet, grammatical fashion. A lull  that must have been an accident carried the words clearly across to  Charming Billy.    \"Thank you, gentlemen. I really don't care for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#7)"],[1,"great gulf below us was immense, dark, and wild, studded  with lakes and parks, and shadowed by moving clouds.    Sheep tracks, old and fresh, afforded us thrills.    Away on the western rim, where we could look down upon a long rugged  iron-gray ridge of mountain, our guide using the glass, found two big  stags. We all had our fill of looking. I could see them plainly with  naked eyes.    We decided to go back to where we could climb down on that side,  halter the horses, leave all extra accoutrements, and stalk those  stags, and take a picture of them.    I led the way, and descended under the rim. It was up and down over  rough shale, and up steps of broken rocks, and down little cliffs.  We crossed the ridge twice, many times having to lend a hand to each  other.    At length I reached a point where I could see the stags lying down.  The place was an open spot on a rocky promonotory with a fringe of  low spruces. The stags were magnificent in size, with antlers in the  velvet. One had twelve points. They were lying in the sun to harden  their horns, according to our guide.    I slipped back to the others, and we all decided to have a look. So we  climbed up. All of us saw the stags, twitching ears and tails.    Then we crept back, and once more I took the lead to crawl round under  the ledge so we could come up about even with them. Here I found the  hardest going yet. I came to a wind-worn crack in the thin ledge, and  from this I could just see the tips of the antlers. I beckoned the  others. Laboriously they climbed. R.C. went through first. I went over  next, and then came Teague.    R.C. and I started to crawl down to a big rock that was our objective  point. We went cautiously, with bated breath and pounding hearts. When  we got there I peeped over to see the stags still lying down. But they  had heads intent and wary. Still I did not think they had scented us.  R.C. took a peep, and turning excitedly he whispered:    \"See only one. And he's standing!\"    And I answered: \"Let's get down around to the left where we can get a  better chance.\" It was only a few feet down. We got there.    When he peeped over at this point he exclaimed: \"They're gone!\"    It was a keen disappointment. \"They winded us,\" I decided.    We looked and looked. But we could not see to our left because of the  bulge of rock. We climbed back. Then I saw one of the stags loping  leisurely off to the left. Teague was calling. He said they had walked  off the promontory, looking up, and stopping occasionally.    Then we realized we must climb back along that broken ridge and then  up to the summit of the mountain. So we started.    That climb back was proof of the effect of excitement on judgment. We  had not calculated at all on the distance or ruggedness, and we had a  job before us. We got along well under the western wall, and fairly  well straight across through the long slope of timber, where we saw  sheep tracks, and expected any moment to sight an old ram. But we did  not find one, and when we got out of the timber upon the bare sliding  slope we had to halt a hundred times. We could zigzag only a few  steps. The altitude was twelve thousand feet, and oxygen seemed  scarce. I nearly dropped. All the climbing appeared to come hardest on  the middle of my right foot, and it could scarcely have burned hotter  if it had been in fire. Despite the strenuous toil there were not many  moments that I was not aware of the vastness of the gulf below, or the  peaceful lakes, brown as amber, or the golden parks. And nearer at  hand I found magenta-colored Indian paint brush, very exquisite and  rare.    Coming out on a ledge I spied a little, dark animal with a long tail.  He was running along the opposite promontory about three hundred yards  distant. When he stopped I took a shot at him and missed by apparently  a scant half foot.    After catching our breath we climbed more and more, and still more, at  last to drop on the rim, hot, wet and utterly spent.    The air was keen, cold, and invigorating. We were soon rested, and  finding our horses we proceeded along the rim westward. Upon rounding  an out-cropping of rock we flushed a flock of ptarmigan--soft gray,  rock-colored birds about the size of pheasants, and when they flew  they showed beautiful white bands on their wings. These are the rare  birds that have feathered feet and turn white in winter. They did not  fly far, and several were so tame they did not fly at all. We got our  little .22 revolvers and began to shoot at the nearest bird. He was  some thirty feet distant. But we could not hit him, and at last Fox,  getting disgusted, tried to catch the bird and made him fly. I felt  relieved, for as we were getting closer and closer with every shot, it  seemed possible that if the ptarmigan sat there long enough we might  eventually have hit him. The mystery was why we shot so poorly. But  this was explained by R.C., who discovered we had been shooting the  wrong shells.    It was a long hard ride down the rough winding trail. But riding down  was a vastly different thing from going up.    On September third we were up at five-thirty. It was clear and cold  and the red of sunrise tinged the peaks. The snow banks looked pink.  All the early morning scene was green, fresh, cool, with that mountain  rareness of atmosphere.    We packed to break camp, and after breakfast it took hours to get our  outfit in shape to start--a long string, resembling a caravan. I knew  that events would occur that day. First we lost one of the dogs. Vern  went back after him. The dogs were mostly chained in pairs, to prevent  their running off. Samson, the giant hound, was chained to a little  dog, and the others were paired not according to size by any means.  The poor dogs were disgusted with the arrangement. It developed  presently that Cain, the bloodhound, a strange and wild hound much  like Don of my old lion-hunting days, slipped us, and was not missed  for hours. Teague decided to send back for him later.    Next in order of events, as we rode up the winding trail through the  spruce forest, we met Teague's cow and calf, which he had kept all  summer in camp. For some reason neither could be left. Teague told us  to ride on, and an hour later when we halted to rest on the Flattop  Mountain he came along with the rest of the train, and in the fore was  the cow alone. It was evident that she was distressed and angry, for  it took two men to keep her in the trail. And another thing plain to  me was the fact that she was going to demoralize the pack horses. We  were not across the wide range of this flat mountain when one of the  pack animals, a lean and lanky sorrel, appeared suddenly to go mad,  and began to buck off a pack. He succeeded. This inspired a black  horse, very appropriately christened Nigger, to try his luck, and he  shifted his pack in short order. It took patience, time, and effort to  repack. The cow was a disorganizer. She took up as wide a trail as a  road. And the pack animals, some with dignity and others with disgust,  tried to avoid her vicinity. Going down the steep forest trail on  the other side the real trouble began. The pack train split, ran and  bolted, crashing through the trees, plunging down steep places, and  jumping logs. It was a wild sort of chase. But luckily the packs  remained intact until we were once more on open, flat ground. All went  well for a while, except for an accident for which I was to blame. I  spurred my horse, and he plunged suddenly past R.C.'s mount, colliding  with him, tearing off my stirrup, and spraining R.C.'s ankle. This  was almost a serious accident, as R.C. has an old baseball ankle that  required favoring.    Next in order was the sorrel. As I saw it, he heedlessly went too near  the cow, which we now called Bossy, and she acted somewhat like a  Spanish Bull, to the effect that the sorrel was scared and angered at  once. He began to run and plunge and buck right into the other pack  animals, dropping articles from his pack as he dashed along. He  stampeded the train, and gave the saddle horses a scare. When order  was restored and the whole outfit gathered together again a full  hour had been lost. By this time all the horses were tired, and that  facilitated progress, because there were no more serious breaks.    Down in the valley it was hot, and the ride grew long and wearisome.  Nevertheless, the scenery was beautiful. The valley was green and  level, and a meandering stream formed many little lakes. On one  side was a steep hill of sage and aspens, and on the other a black,  spear-pointed spruce forest, rising sheer to a bold, blunt peak  patched with snow-banks, and bronze and gray in the clear light. Huge  white clouds sailed aloft, making dark moving shadows along the great  slopes.    We reached our turning-off place about five o'clock, and again entered  the fragrant, quiet forest--a welcome change. We climbed and climbed,  at length coming into an open park of slopes and green borders of  forest, with a lake in the center. We pitched camp on the skirt of the  western slope, under the spruces, and worked hard to get the tents up  and boughs cut for beds. Darkness caught us with our hands still full,  and we ate supper in the light of a camp-fire, with the black, deep  forest behind, and the pale afterglow across the lake.    I had a bad night, being too tired to sleep well. Many times I saw the  moon shadows of spruce branches trembling on the tent walls, and the  flickering shadows of the dying camp-fire. I heard the melodious  tinkle of the bells on the hobbled horses. Bossy bawled often--a  discordant break in the serenity of the night. Occasionally the hounds  bayed her.    Toward morning I slept some, and awakened with what seemed a broken  back. All, except R.C., were slow in crawling out. The sun rose hot.  This lower altitude was appreciated by all. After breakfast we set to  work to put the camp in order. "]]]
