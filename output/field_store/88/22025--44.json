Perry's Pike is so bad people will not use it; a road alongside  the fence has been made by travel, and in dry weather this road is  good, barring the pipes which cross it from oil-wells, and the  many stone culverts, at each of which it is necessary to swing up  on to the pike. The turns from the side road on to the pike at  these culverts are pretty sharp, and in swinging up one, while  going at about twenty-five miles an hour, we narrowly escaped  going over the low stone wall into the ditch below. On that and  one other occasion the Professor took a firmer hold of the side of  the machine, but, be it said to the credit of learning, at no time  did he utter an exclamation, or show the slightest sign of losing  his head and jumping--as he afterwards remarked, \"What's the use?\"    To any one by the roadside the danger of a smash-up seems to come  and pass in an instant,--not so to the person driving the machine;  to him the danger is perceptible a very appreciable length of time  before the critical point is reached.    The secret of good driving lies in this early and complete  appreciation of difficulties and dangers encountered. \"Blind  recklessness\" is a most expressive phrase; it means all the words  indicate, and is contra-distinguished from open-eyed or wise  recklessness.    The timid man is never reckless, the wise man frequently is, the  fool always; the recklessness of the last is blind; if he gets  through all right he is lucky.    It is reckless to race sixty miles an hour over a highway; but the  man who does it with his eyes wide open, with a perfect  appreciation of all the dangers, is, in reality, less reckless  than the man who blindly runs his machine, hit or miss, along the  road at thirty miles an hour,--the latter leaves havoc in his  train.    One must have a cool, quick, and accurate appreciation of the  margin of safety under all circumstances; it is the utilization of  this entire margin--to the very verge--that yields the largest  results in the way of rapid progress.    Every situation presents its own problem,--a problem largely  mechanical,--a matter of power, speed, and obstructions; the  chauffeur will win out whose perception of the conditions  affecting these several factors is quickest and clearest.    One man will go down a hill, or make a safe turn at a high rate of  speed, where another will land in the ditch, simply because the  former overlooks nothing, while the latter does. It is not so much  a matter of experience as of natural bent and adaptability. Some  men can drive machines with very little experience and no  instructions; others cannot, however long they try and however  much they are told.    Accidents on the road are due to  Defects in the road,  Defects in the machine, or  Defects in the driver.    American roads are bad, but not so bad that they can, with  justice, be held responsible for many of the troubles attributed  to them.    The roads are as they are, a practically constant,--and, for some  time to come,--an unchangeable quantity. The roads are like the  hills and the mountains, obstacles which must be overcome, and  machines must be constructed to overcome them.    Complaints against American roads by American manufacturers of  automobiles are as irrelevant to the issue as would be complaints  on the part of traction-engine builders or wagon makers. Any man  who makes vehicles for a given country must make them to go under  the conditions--good, bad, or indifferent--which prevail in that  country. In building automobiles for America or Australia, the  only pertinent question is, \"What are the roads of America or  Australia?\" not what ought they to be.    The manufacturer who finds fault with the roads should go out of  the business.    Roads will be improved, but in a country so vast and sparsely  settled as North America, it is not conceivable that within the  next century a net-work of fine roads will cover the land; for  generations to come there will be soft roads, sandy roads, rocky  roads, hilly roads, muddy roads,--and the American automobile must  be so constructed as to cover them as they are.    The manufacturer who waits for good roads everywhere should move  his factory to the village of Falling Waters, and sleep in the  Kaatskills.    Machines which give out on bad roads, simply because the roads are  bad, are faultily constructed.    Defects in roads, to which mishaps may be fairly attributed, are  only those unlooked for conditions which make trouble for all  other vehicles, such as wash-outs, pit-holes, weak culverts,  broken bridges,--in short, conditions which require repairs to  restore the road to normal condition. The normal condition may be  very bad; but whatever it is, the automobile must be constructed  so as to travel thereon, else it is not adapted to that section of  the country.    It may be discouraging to the driver for pleasure to find in rainy  weather almost bottomless muck and mud on portions of the main  travelled highway between New York and Buffalo, but that, for the  present, is normal. The manufacturer may regret the condition and  wish for better, but he cannot be heard to complain, and if the  machine, with reasonably careful driving, gives out, it is the  fault of the maker and not the roads.    It follows, therefore, that few troubles can be rightfully  attributed to defects in the road, since what are commonly called  defects are conditions quite normal to the country.    It was nearly six o'clock when we arrived at Fremont. The streets  were filled with people in gala attire, the militia were out,  --bands playing, fire-crackers going,--a belated Fourth of July.    When we stopped for water, we casually asked a small patriot,--    \"What are you celebrating?\"    \"The second of August,\" was the prompt reply. I left it to the  Professor to find out what had happened on the second of August,  for the art of teaching is the concealment of ignorance.    With a fine assumption of his very best lecture-room manner, the  Professor leaned carelessly upon the delicate indicator on the  gasoline tank and began:    \"That was a great day, my boy.\"    \"Yes, sir, it was.\"    \"And it comes once a year.\"    \"Why, sure.\"    \"Ahem--\" in some confusion, \"I mean you celebrate once a year.\"    \"Sure, we celebrate every second of August, and it comes every  year.\"    \"Quite right, quite right; always recall with appropriate  exercises the great events in your country's history.\" The  Professor peered benignly over his glasses at the boy and  continued kindly but firmly:    \"Now, my boy, do you go to school?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Very good. Now can you tell me why the people of Fremont  celebrate the second of August?\"    \"Sure, it is on account of--\" then a curious on-looker nudged the  Professor in the ribs and began, as so many had done before,--    \"Say, mister, it's none of my business--\"    \"Exactly,\" groaned the Professor; \"it weighs a ton--two tons  sometimes--more in the sand; it cost twelve hundred dollars, and  will cost more before we are done with it. Yes, I know what you  are about to say, you could buy a 'purty slick' team for that  price,--in fact, a dozen nags such as that one leaning against  you,--but we don't care for horses. My friend here who is spilling  the water all over the machine and the small boy, once owned a  horse, it kicked over the dash-board, missed his mother-in-law and  hit him; horse's intention good, but aim bad,--since then he has  been prejudiced against horses; it goes by gasoline--sometimes;  that is not a boiler, it is the cooler--on hot days we take turns  sitting on it;--explosions,--electric spark,--yes, it is queer;  --man at last stop made same bright remark; no danger from  explosions if you are not too near,--about a block away is safer;  start by turning a crank; yes, that is queer, queerer than the  other queer things; cylinder does get hot, but so do we all at  times; we ought to have water jackets--that is a joke that goes  with the machine; yes, it is very fast, from fifty to seventy  miles per--; 'per what?' you say; well, that depends upon the  roads,--not at all, I assure you, no trouble to anticipate your  inquiries by these answers--it is so seldom one meets any one who  is really interested--you can order a machine by telegraph; any  more information you would like?--No!--then my friend, in return,  will you tell me why you celebrate the second of August?\"    \"Danged if I know.\" And we never found out.    At Bellevue we lighted our lamps and ran to Norwalk over a very  fair road, arriving a few minutes after eight. Norwalk liveries  did not like automobiles, so we put the machine under a shed.    This second day's run was about one hundred and fifty miles in  twelve hours and fifty-four minutes gross time; deducting stops,  left nine hours and fifty-four minutes running time--an average of  about fourteen and one-half miles per hour.    Ohio roads are by no means so good as Indiana. Not until we left  Painesville did we find any gravel to speak of. There was not much  deep sand, but roads were dry, dusty, and rough; in many  localities hard clay with deep ruts and holes.    A six o'clock call and a seven o'clock breakfast gave time enough  to inspect the machine.    The water-tank was leaking through a crack in the side, but not so  badly that we could not go on to Cleveland, where repairs could be  made more quickly. A slight pounding which had developed was  finally located in the pinion of a small gear-wheel that operated  the exhaust-valve.    It is sometimes by no means easy to locate a pounding in a  gasoline motor, and yet it must be found and stopped. An expert  from the factory once worked four days trying to locate a very  loud and annoying pounding. He, of course, looked immediately at  the crank- and wrist-pins, taking up what little wear was  perceptible, but the pounding remained; then eccentric strap,  pump, and every bearing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12384"],[0,"Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (#7)"],[1,"ls,            The south should have paused, and thrice,          Ere with heat of her hate she hatched            The egg with the cockatrice._    A path down the mountain winds to the glade    Where the dead of the Moonlight Fight lie low;  A hand reaches out of the thin-laid mould    As begging help which none can bestow.  But the field-mouse small and busy ant    Heap their hillocks, to hide if they may the woe:  By the bubbling spring lies the rusted canteen,    And the drum which the drummer-boy dying let go.            _Dust to dust, and blood for blood--            Passion and pangs! Has Time          Gone back? or is this the Age            Of the world's great Prime?_    The wagon mired and cannon dragged    Have trenched their scar; the plain  Tramped like the cindery beach of the damned--    A site for the city of Cain.  And stumps of forests for dreary leagues    Like a massacre show. The armies have lain  By fires where gums and balms did burn,    And the seeds of Summer's reign.            _Where are the birds and boys?            Who shall go chestnutting when          October returns? The nuts--            O, long ere they grow again._    They snug their huts with the chapel-pews,    In court-houses stable their steeds--  Kindle their fires with indentures and bonds,    And old Lord Fairfax's parchment deeds;  And Virginian gentlemen's libraries old--    Books which only the scholar heeds--  Are flung to his kennel. It is ravage and range,    And gardens are left to weeds.            _Turned adrift into war            Man runs wild on the plain,          Like the jennets let loose            On the Pampas--zebras again._    Like the Pleiads dim, see the tents through the storm--    Aloft by the hill-side hamlet's graves,  On a head-stone used for a hearth-stone there    The water is bubbling for punch for our braves.  What if the night be drear, and the blast    Ghostly shrieks? their rollicking staves  Make frolic the heart; beating time with their swords,    What care they if Winter raves?            _Is life but a dream? and so,            In the dream do men laugh aloud?          So strange seems mirth in a camp,            So like a white tent to a shroud._      II    The May-weed springs; and comes a Man    And mounts our Signal Hill;  A quiet Man, and plain in garb--    Briefly he looks his fill,  Then drops his gray eye on the ground,    Like a loaded mortar he is still:  Meekness and grimness meet in him--    The silent General.            _Were men but strong and wise,            Honest as Grant, and calm,          War would be left to the red and black ants,            And the happy world disarm._    That eve a stir was in the camps,    Forerunning quiet soon to come  Among the streets of beechen huts    No more to know the drum.  The weed shall choke the lowly door,    And foxes peer within the gloom,  Till scared perchange by Mosby's prowling men,    Who ride in the rear of doom.            _Far West, and farther South,            Wherever the sword has been,          Deserted camps are met,            And desert graves are seen._    The livelong night they ford the flood;    With guns held high they silent press,  Till shimmers the grass in their bayonets' sheen--    On Morning's banks their ranks they dress;  Then by the forests lightly wind,    Whose waving boughs the pennons seem to bless,  Borne by the cavalry scouting on--    Sounding the Wilderness.            _Like shoals of fish in spring            That visit Crusoe's isle,          The host in the lonesome place--            The hundred thousand file._    The foe that held his guarded hills    Must speed to woods afar;  For the scheme that was nursed by the Culpepper hearth    With the slowly-smoked cigar--  The scheme that smouldered through winter long    Now bursts into act--into war--  The resolute scheme of a heart as calm    As the Cyclone's core.            _The fight for the city is fought            In Nature's old domain;          Man goes out to the wilds,            And Orpheus' charm is vain._    In glades they meet skull after skull    Where pine-cones lay--the rusted gun,  Green shoes full of bones, the mouldering coat    And cuddled-up skeleton;  And scores of such. Some start as in dreams,    And comrades lost bemoan:  By the edge of those wilds Stonewall had charged--    But the Year and the Man were gone.            _At the height of their madness            The night winds pause,          Recollecting themselves;            But no lull in these wars._    A gleam!--a volley! And who shall go    Storming the swarmers in jungles dread?  No cannon-ball answers, no proxies are sent--    They rush in the shrapnel's stead.  Plume and sash are vanities now--    Let them deck the pall of the dead;  They go where the shade is, perhaps into Hades,    Where the brave of all times have led.            _There's a dust of hurrying feet,            Bitten lips and bated breath,          And drums that challenge to the grave,            And faces fixed, forefeeling death._    What husky huzzahs in the hazy groves--    What flying encounters fell;  Pursuer and pursued like ghosts disappear    In gloomed shade--their end who shall tell?  The crippled, a ragged-barked stick for a crutch,    Limp to some elfin dell--  Hobble from the sight of dead faces--white    As pebbles in a well.            _Few burial rites shall be;            No priest with book and band          Shall come to the secret place            Of the corpse in the foeman's land._    Watch and fast, march and fight--clutch your gun?    Day-fights and night-fights; sore is the strees;  Look, through the pines what line comes on?    Longstreet slants through the hauntedness?  'Tis charge for charge, and shout for yell:    Such battles on battles oppress--  But Heaven lent strength, the Right strove well,    And emerged from the Wilderness.            _Emerged, for the way was won;            But the Pillar of Smoke that led          Was brand-like with ghosts that went up                Ashy and red._    None can narrate that strife in the pines,    A seal is on it--Sabaean lore!  Obscure as the wood, the entangled rhyme    But hints at the maze of war--  Vivid glimpses or livid through peopled gloom,    And fires which creep and char--  A riddle of death, of which the slain      Sole solvers are.            _Long they withhold the roll            Of the shroudless dead. It is right;          Not yet can we bear the flare              Of the funeral light._        On the Photograph of a Corps Commander.      Ay, man is manly. Here you see    The warrior-carriage of the head,  And brave dilation of the frame;    And lighting all, the soul that led  In Spottsylvania's charge to victory,    Which justifies his fame.    A cheering picture. It is good    To look upon a Chief like this,  In whom the spirit moulds the form.    Here favoring Nature, oft remiss,  With eagle mien expressive has endued    A man to kindle strains that warm.    Trace back his lineage, and his sires,    Yeoman or noble, you shall find  Enrolled with men of Agincourt,    Heroes who shared great Harry's mind.  Down to us come the knightly Norman fires,    And front the Templars bore.    Nothing can lift the heart of man    Like manhood in a fellow-man.  The thought of heaven's great King afar    But humbles us--too weak to scan;  But manly greatness men can span,    And feel the bonds that draw.        The Swamp Angel.[10]      There is a coal-black Angel    With a thick Afric lip,  And he dwells (like the hunted and harried)    In a swamp where the green frogs dip.  But his face is against a City    Which is over a bay of the sea,  And he breathes with a breath that is blastment,    And dooms by a far decree.    By night there is fear in the City,    Through the darkness a star soareth on;  There's a scream that screams up to the zenith,    Then the poise of a meteor lone--  Lighting far the pale fright of the faces,    And downward the coming is seen;  Then the rush, and the burst, and the havoc,    And wails and shrieks between.    It comes like the thief in the gloaming;    It comes, and none may foretell  The place of the coming--the glaring;    They live in a sleepless spell  That wizens, and withers, and whitens;    It ages the young, and the bloom  Of the maiden is ashes of roses--    The Swamp Angel broods in his gloom.    Swift is his messengers' going,    But slowly he saps their halls,  As if by delay deluding.    They move from their crumbling walls  Farther and farther away;    But the Angel sends after and after,  By night with the flame of his ray--    By night with the voice of his screaming--  Sends after them, stone by stone,    And farther walls fall, farther portals,  And weed follows weed through the Town.    Is this the proud City? the scorner    Which never would yield the ground?  Which mocked at the coal-black Angel?    The cup of despair goes round.  Vainly she calls upon Michael    (The white man's seraph was he),  For Michael has fled from his tower    To the Angel over the sea.    Who weeps for the woeful City    Let him weep for our guilty kind;  Who joys at her wild despairing--    Christ, the Forgiver, convert his mind.        The Battle for the Bay.  (August, 1864.)      O mystery of noble hearts,    To whom mysterious seas have been  In midnight watches, lonely calm and storm,      A stern, sad disciple,  And rooted out the false and vain,    And chastened them to aptness for    Devotion and the deeds of war,  And death which smiles and cheers in spite of pain.    Beyond the bar the land-wind dies,    The prows becharmed at anchor swim:  A summer night; the stars withdrawn look down--      Fair eve of battle grim.  The sentries pace, bonetas glide;    Below, the sleeping sailor swing,    And in their dreams to quarters spring,  Or cheer their flag, or breast a stormy tide.    But drums are beat: _Up anchor all!_    The triple lines steam slowly on;"]]]
