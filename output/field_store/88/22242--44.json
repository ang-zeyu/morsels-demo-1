Angiomatous tumors are occasionally found affecting horses'  legs--usually the result of some injury; and because of their size or  position, they mechanically interfere with function. Furthermore, when  such tumors are located on the inner or flexor side of joints, enough  pain is occasioned that affected animals show evidence of distress,  usually by intermittent lameness.    Horses do not suffer from distension of veins as does man, that is,  there is rarely to be seen a case wherein much disturbance from this  source exists.      AFFECTIONS OF LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS.    Inflamed lymph vessels and glands, the result of various causes, is a  rather common source of lameness of horses. When one considers the  proportion of tissue that is composed of lymph vessels and glands, it is  then obvious that inflammation of these structures should cause a  painful affection of members, when so affected, and that marked lameness  and, in some instances, general constitutional disturbance such as  anorexia, hyperthermia and general circulatory disorder are to follow.    Lymphangitis is most frequently occasioned by the introduction of septic  material into the tissues; consequently, infectious lymphangitis is more  frequently observed than the non-infectious type.    Specific infectious forms of lymphangitis are seen in glanders and in  strangles; infectious types of this disturbance are found in many  instances where, initially, a localized or circumscribed infection has  occurred--the contagium having been introduced by way of an injury. An  example of this kind is to be seen in a wound perforating the tibial  fascia, where the injury is inflicted by means of a horse being kicked  by another animal shod with sharp shoe-calks. Cases of this kind  invariably result in a septic lymphangitis, and frequently lymphadenitis  also occurs, for the inguinal lymph glands are so situated that their  becoming contaminated is almost certain.    The trite phrase that \"the tissues are bathed in lymph\" should make  clear the reason for the frequent occurrence of infectious lymphangitis  and lymphadenitis. Foreign substances, bacteria and their products,  inorganic material and in fact, anything that is introduced into the  tissues, if soluble or miscible, will be taken up and conveyed by the  afferent lymph vessels and disseminated throughout the system--hence the  constitutional disturbances so frequently thus caused.    A non-infectious type of lymphangitis is frequently seen in the heavy  draft breeds of horses and in such cases one or both hind legs are  involved--it is very seldom that the thoracic limbs become so affected.  Law[3] refers to this ailment as \"Acute Lymphangitis of Plethora in  Horse.\" When one takes into consideration that these cases so frequently  occur in heavy draft animals that are not worked regularly, that the  pelvic limbs are the ones involved, and that the disorder often runs a  short course (recovery often taking place within two or three days, with  no treatment given other than a purge, circulatory stimulants and  walking exercise) it is plausible to ascribe the condition to idiopathic  factors.    Admitting the frequency of non-infectious lymphangitis, the practitioner  must not confuse this type with similar lymphatic inflammation  occasioned by nail punctures of the foot. It is very embarrassing indeed  to make a diagnosis of lymphangitis--expecting that the disturbance will  terminate favorably and uneventually--and later to discover a sub-solar  abscess caused by a nail prick in the region of the heel.    Recurrent attacks of this disturbance cause hypertrophy of the lymph  vessels and in some cases lymphangiectasis. In old subjects used for  dissection or surgical purposes, it is very evident that in the ones  which have suffered from chronic lymphangitis there exists an excessive  amount of sub-facial connective tissue, making subcutaneous neurectomies  quite difficult in some instances.    A sequel of chronic lymphangitis is a condition known as elephantiasis.  In such cases there occurs a hyperplasia of the skin and subcutaneous  tissues, resulting in some instances, in the affected member attaining  an enormous size. Sporadic cases of this kind are to be seen  occasionally, and are apparently caused by repeated attacks of  lymphangitis. The affection is not benefited by treatment, and while a  horse's leg may become so heavy and cumbersome as to mechanically impede  its gait, as well as to fatigue the subject when made to do service even  at a slow pace, elephantiasis causes no constitutional derangement. The  hind legs, in elephantiasis, are affected and a unilateral involvement  is more often seen than a bilateral one. The legs may be enlarged from  the extremity to the body, but ordinarily the affection does not extend  higher than the hock or the mid-tibial region.    A chronic, progressive, hyperplastic-degeneration exists in some cases  and the subjects are in time rendered unserviceable because of the  burden of getting about encumbered by the affected extremity. In other  animals hyperplasia progresses for a time--until the parts become  greatly enlarged and conditions apparently attain an immutable state.  Nevertheless animals so affected may continue in service for years  without being distressed.      AFFECTIONS OF THE FEET.    Lameness is very often due to affections of the feet, and in all foot  diseases probably the most constant cause is injury inflicted in some  manner. Resultant from injury, there frequently develops complications  and the one most often seen is infection.    Because of the fact that the feet are constantly exposed to germ-laden  soil and filth, if not actually bathed in such infectious materials, it  naturally follows that septic infection of some part of the feet must be  of frequent occurrence.    Subsequent to being obliged to stand in mud and other damp or wet media,  exposure to desiccating influences such as stabling upon dry floors, or  at service on hot and dry road surfaces causes the insensitive parts of  the feet to become dry, hard and brittle. This favors \"checking\" of the  protecting structures and it frequently results in the formation of  large fissures which expose the underlying sensitive parts of the feet  and lameness is the inevitable outcome.    The function of the feet--bearing the weight of the animal at all times  when the subject is not recumbent, and in addition to this, the  increased strain put upon them at heavy draft work, together with the  concussion and buffeting occasioned by locomotion, make the feet  susceptible to frequent affections of various kinds.    Being almost completely encased by a somewhat inexpansible and  insensitive wall and sole, renders the foot subject to pathologic  changes peculiar to itself. The very nature of the structure of the foot  together with the function of the sensitive lamina is sufficient cause  for an affection unlike that seen involving other tissues--laminitis.    An exhaustive consideration of foot affections is a study in itself and  one that comes within the realm of pathologic shoeing; nevertheless, a  practical knowledge of diseases of the foot is indispensable in the  diagnosis of lameness wherein the foot may be at fault.    The peculiar nature of foot affections renders them difficult of  classification on any sort of basis that is helpful in the consideration  of this subject. Injuries are the most constant cause of foot lameness,  yet one must admit that there results complications because of infection  in most instances; and that in some cases the injury is slight--just  enough to permit the introduction of vulnerant organisms into the  tissues. Therefore, one might well classify affections of the feet as  infectious and non-infectious. There can be grouped in the class of  infectious affections such conditions as nail pricks, calk wounds and  canker. In the class of non-infectious affections one may consider  conditions such as laminitis, strain and fractures.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: A System of Veterinary Medicine by E. Wallis Hoare,  F.R.C.V.S., Vol. I, page 519.]    [Footnote 2: Ibid, page 807.]    [Footnote 3: Vol. I, page 534, Veterinary Medicine, by James Law,  F.R.C.V.S.]          SECTION II.    DIAGNOSTIC PRINCIPLES.      _To observe attentively is to remember distinctly._--_Poe_.    Before treatment is administered in constitutional disturbances  resulting in disease, _cause_ is logically sought; so, in order to  handle effectively any case of lameness, it is necessary first to  discover the source of the trouble and contributing conditions affecting  the structures. Hence, diagnostic ability is the prime requisite; and a  thorough knowledge of pathologic anatomy or of surgical technic is of  little value if this knowledge is not applied with the insight of the  trained diagnostician.    The cruel and unnecessary methods employed by those untrained for  diagnostics, cannot be too vigorously condemned. For instance, the  application of an active and depilating vesicant upon a large area on  the gluteal or crural region, in a case where the practitioner \"guesses\"  the condition to be one of \"hip lameness,\" constitutes an exposition of  gross ignorance, and at once stamps the perpetrator as a crude bungler  without scientific insight whose works are no credit to his profession.  How much better it would be, if the practitioner does not see fit to  call in a competent consultant, to prescribe a suitable agent to be  given internally, and to recommend complete rest for the subject.    In establishing a diagnosis in such cases, the student or practitioner  seldom has recourse to laboratory assistance, and his work is done by  means of physical examination; therefore, a thorough knowledge and a  clear conception of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#7)"],[1,"aromatic oil, but it is most fragrant and  plentiful in the unexpanded flower-bud, which are the cloves of  commerce. Cloves have been brought into the European market for more  than 2000 years. The plant is a native of the Moluccas and other islands  in the China seas. \"The average annual crop of cloves,\" says Burnett,  \"is, from each tree, 2 or 2-1/2 lbs., but a fine tree has been known to  yield 125 lbs. of this spice in a single season, and as 5000 cloves only  weigh one pound, there must have been at least 625,000 flowers upon this  single tree.\"    [Illustration: Clove.]    The oil of cloves may be obtained by expression from the fresh  flower-buds, but the usual method of procuring it is by distillation,  which is carried on to a very great extent in this country. Few  essential oils have a more extensive use in perfumery than that of  cloves; it combines well with grease, soap, and spirit, and, as will be  seen in the recipes for the various bouquets given hereafter, it forms a  leading feature in some of the most popular handkerchief essences,  Rondeletia, the Guard's Bouquet, &c., and will be found where least  expected. For essence of cloves, dissolve oil of cloves in the  proportion of two ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit.    DILL.--Perfumers are now and then asked for \"dill water;\" it  is, however, more a druggist's article than a perfumer's, as it is more  used for its medicinal qualities than for its odor, which by the way, is  rather pleasant than otherwise. Some ladies use a mixture of half dill  water and half rose water, as a simple cosmetic, \"to clear the  complexion.\"    The oil of dill is procured by submitting the crushed fruit of dill  (_Anethum graveolens_) with water to distillation. The oil floats on the  surface of the distillate, from which it is separated by the funnel in  the usual manner; after the separation of the oil, the \"water\" is fit  for sale. Oil of dill may be used with advantage, if in small  proportions, and mixed with other oils, for perfuming soap.    EGLANTINE, or SWEET BRIAR, notwithstanding what the  poet Robert Noyes says--                      \"In fragrance yields,      Surpassing citron groves or spicy fields,\"    does not find a place in the perfumer's \"scent-room\" except in name.  This, like many other sweet-scented plants, does not repay the labor of  collecting its odor. The fragrant part of this plant is destroyed more  or less under every treatment that it is put to, and hence it is  discarded. As, however, the article is in demand by the public, a  species of fraud is practised upon them, by imitating it thus:--    IMITATION EGLANTINE, OR ESSENCE OF SWEET BRIAR.    Spirituous extract of French rose pomatum,        1 pint.       \"        \"       cassie,                   1/4 \"       \"        \"       fleur d'orange,           1/4 \"  Esprit de rose,                                 1/4 \"  Oil of neroli,                                1/2 drachm.  Oil of lemon grass (verbena oil),             1/2 \"    ELDER (_Sambucus nigra_).--The only preparation of this plant  for its odorous quality used by the perfumer, is elder-flower water. To  prepare it, take nine pounds of elder-flowers, free from stalk, and  introduce it to the still with four gallons of water; the first three  gallons that come over is all that need be preserved for use; one ounce  of rectified spirit should be added to each gallon of \"water\" distilled,  and when bottled it is ready for sale. Other preparations of elder  flowers are made, such as milk of elder, extract of elder, &c., which  will be found in their proper place under Cosmetics. Two or three new  materials made from this flower will also be given hereafter, which are  likely to meet with a very large sale on account of the reputed cooling  qualities of the ingredients; of these we would call attention more  particularly to cold cream of elder-flowers, and to elder oil for the  hair.    The preparations of elder-flowers, if made according to the  Pharmacopoeias, are perfectly useless, as the forms therein given show  an utter want of knowledge of the properties of the materials employed.    FENNEL (_Foeniculum vulgare_).--Dried fennel herb, when  ground, enters into the composition of some sachet powders. The oil of  fennel, in conjunction with other aromatic oils, may be used for  perfuming soap. It is procurable by distillation.    FLAG (SWEET) (_Acorus calamus_).--The roots, or  rhizome, of the sweet flag, yield by distillation a pleasant-smelling  oil; 1 cwt. of the rhizome will thus yield one pound of oil. It can be  used according to the pleasure of the manufacturer in scenting grease,  soap, or for extracts, but requires other sweet oils with it to hide its  origin.    GERANIUM (_Pelargonium odoratissimum_, rose-leaf  geranium).--The leaves of this plant yield by distillation a very  agreeable rosy-smelling oil, so much resembling real otto of rose, that  it is used very extensively for the adulteration of that valuable oil,  and is grown very largely for that express purpose. It is principally  cultivated in the south of France, and in Turkey (by the rose-growers).  In the department of Seine-et-Oise, at Montfort-Lamaury, in France,  hundreds of acres of it may be seen growing. 1 cwt. of leaves will yield  about two ounces of essential oil. Used to adulterate otto of rose, it  is in its turn itself adulterated with ginger grass oil (_Andropogon_),  and thus formerly was very difficult to procure genuine; on account of  the increased cultivation of the plant, it is now, however, easily  procured pure. Some samples are greenish-colored, others nearly white,  but we prefer that of a brownish tint.    When dissolved in rectified spirit, in the proportion of about six  ounces to the gallon, it forms the \"extract of rose-leaf geranium\" of  the shops. A word or two is necessary about the oil of geranium, as much  confusion is created respecting it, in consequence of there being an oil  under the name of geranium, but which in reality is derived from the  _Andropogon nardus_, cultivated in the Moluccas. This said andropogon  (geranium!) oil can be used to adulterate the true geranium, and hence  we suppose its nomenclature in the drug markets. The genuine rose-leaf  geranium oil fetches about 6_s._ per ounce, while the andropogon oil is  not worth more than that sum per pound. And we may observe here, that  the perfuming essential oils are best purchased through the wholesale  perfumers, as from the nature of their trade they have a better  knowledge and means of obtaining the real article than the drug-broker.  On account of the pleasing odor of the true oil of rose-leaf geranium,  it is a valuable article for perfuming many materials, and appears to  give the public great satisfaction.    HELIOTROPE.--Either by maceration or enfleurage with clarified  fat, we may obtain this fine odor from the flowers of the _Heliotrope  Peruvianum_ or _H. grandiflorum_. Exquisite as the odor of this plant  is, at present it is not applied to use by the manufacturing perfumer.  This we think rather a singular fact, especially as the perfume is  powerful and the flowers abundant. We should like to hear of some  experiments being tried with this plant for procuring its odor in this  country, and for that purpose now suggest the mode of operation which  would most likely lead to successful results. For a small trial in the  first instance, which can be managed by any person having the run of a  garden, we will say, procure an ordinary glue-pot now in common use,  which melts the material by the boiling of water; it is in fact a  water-bath, in chemical parlance--one capable of holding a pound or more  of melted fat. At the season when the flowers are in bloom, obtain half  a pound of fine mutton suet, melt the suet and strain it through a close  hair-sieve, allow the liquefied fat, as it falls from the sieve, to drop  into cold spring water; this operation granulates and washes the blood  and membrane from it. In order to start with a perfectly inodorous  grease, the melting and granulation process may be repeated three or  four times; finally, remelt the fat and cast it into a pan to free it  from adhering water.    Now put the clarified suet into the macerating pot, and place it in such  a position near the fire of the greenhouse, or elsewhere that will keep  it warm enough to be liquid; into the fat throw as many flowers as you  can, and there let them remain for twenty-four hours; at this time  strain the fat from the spent flowers and add fresh ones; repeat this  operation for a week: we expect at the last straining the fat will have  become very highly perfumed, and when cold may be justly termed _Pomade  a la Heliotrope_.    The cold pomade being chopped up, like suet for a pudding, is now to be  put into a wide-mouthed bottle, and covered with spirits as highly  rectified as can be obtained, and left to digest for a week or more; the  spirit then strained off will be highly perfumed; in reality it will be  _extract of Heliotrope_, a delightful perfume for the handkerchief. The  rationale of the operation is simple enough: the fat body has a strong  affinity or attraction for the odorous body, or essential oil of the  flowers, and it therefore absorbs it by contact, and becomes itself  perfumed. In the second operation, the spirit has a much greater  attraction for the fragrant principle than the fatty matter; the former,  therefore, becomes perfumed at the expense of the latter. The same  experiment may be repeated with almond oil substituted for the fat.    The experiment here hinted at, may be varied with any flowers that there  are to spare; indeed, by having the macerating bath larger than was  mentioned above, an excellent _millefleur_ pomade and essence might be  produced from every conservatory in the kingdom, and thus we may receive  another enjoyment from the cultivation of flowers beyond their beauty of  form and color.
