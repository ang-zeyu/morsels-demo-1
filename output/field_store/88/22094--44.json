It is necessary that this should be pointed out clearly, even  at the risk of misapprehension, as confusions are here very common.        The essentially sexual character of the sensitivity of the      orificial contacts is shown by the fact that it may sometimes be      accidentally developed even in early childhood. This is well      illustrated in a case recorded by Fere. A little girl of 4, of      nervous temperament and liable to fits of anger in which she      would roll on the ground and tear her clothes, once ran out into      the garden in such a fit of temper and threw herself on the lawn      in a half-naked condition. As she lay there two dogs with whom      she was accustomed to play came up and began to lick the      uncovered parts of the body. It so happened that as one dog      licked her mouth the other licked her sexual parts. She      experienced a shock of intense sensation which she could never      forget and never describe, accompanied by a delicious tension of      the sexual organs. She rose and ran away with a feeling of shame,      though she could not comprehend what had happened. The impression      thus made was so profound that it persisted throughout life and      served as the point of departure of sexual perversions, while the      contact of a dog's tongue with her mouth alone afterward sufficed      to evoke sexual pleasure. (Fere, _Archives de Neurologie_, 1903,      No. 90.)        I do not purpose to discuss here either _cunnilingus_ (the      apposition of the mouth to the female pudendum) or _fellatio_      (the apposition of the mouth to the male organ), the agent in the      former case being, in normal heterosexual relationships, a man,      in the latter a woman; they are not purely tactile phenomena, but      involve various other physical and psychic elements.      _Cunnilingus_ was a very familiar manifestation in classic times,      as shown by frequent and mostly very contemptuous references in      Aristophanes, Juvenal, and many other Greek and Roman writers;      the Greeks regarded it as a Phoenician practice, just as it is      now commonly considered French; it tends to be especially      prevalent at all periods of high civilization. _Fellatio_ has      also been equally well known, in both ancient and modern times,      especially as practiced by inverted men. It may be accepted that      both _cunnilingus_ and _fellatio_, as practiced by either sex,      are liable to occur among healthy or morbid persons, in      heterosexual or homosexual relationships. They have little      psychological significance, except to the extent that when      practiced to the exclusion of normal sexual relationships they      become perversions, and as such tend to be associated with      various degenerative conditions, although such associations are      not invariable.        The essentially normal character of _cunnilingus_ and _fellatio_,      when occurring as incidents in the process of tumescence, is      shown by the fact that they are practiced by many animals. This      is the case, for instance, among dogs. Moll points out that not      infrequently the bitch, while under the dog, but before      intromission, will change her position to lick the dog's      penis--apparently from an instinctive impulse to heighten her own      and his excitement--and then return to the normal position, while      _cunnilingus_ is of constant occurrence among animals, and on      account of its frequency among dogs was called by the Greeks      skylax (Rosenbaum, _Geschichte der Lustseuche im Altertume_,      fifth edition, pp. 260-278; also notes in Moll, _Untersuchungen      ueber pie Libido Sexualis_, Bd. I, pp. 134, 369; and Bloch,      _Beitraege zur AEtiologie der Psychopathia Sexualis_, Teil II, pp.      216 et seq.)        The occurrence of _cunnilingus_ as a sexual episode of tumescence      among lower human races is well illustrated by a practice of the      natives of the Caroline Islands (as recorded by Kubary in his      ethnographic study of this people and quoted by Ploss and      Bartels, _Das Weib_, vol. i). It is here customary for a man to      place a piece of fish between the labia, while he stimulates the      latter by his tongue and teeth until under stress of sexual      excitement the woman urinates; this is regarded as an indication      that the proper moment for intercourse has arrived. Such a      practice rests on physiologically sound facts whatever may be      thought of it from an aesthetic standpoint.        The contrast between the normal aesthetic standpoint in this      matter and the lover's is well illustrated by the following      quotations: Dr. A.B. Holder, in the course of his description of      the American Indian _bote_, remarks, concerning _fellatio_: \"Of      all the many varieties of sexual perversion, this, it seems to      me, is the most debased that could be conceived of.\" On the other      hand, in a communication from a writer and scholar of high      intellectual distinction occurs the statement: \"I affirm that, of      all sexual acts, _fellatio_ is most an affair of imagination and      sympathy.\" It must be pointed out that there is no contradiction      in these two statements, and that each is justified, according as      we take the point of view of the ordinary onlooker or of the      impassioned lover eager to give a final proof of his or her      devotion. It must be added that from a scientific point of view      we are not entitled to take either side.    Of the whole of this group of phenomena, the most typical and the most  widespread example is certainly the kiss. We have in the lips a highly  sensitive frontier region between skin and mucous membrane, in many  respects analogous to the vulvo-vaginal orifice, and reinforcible,  moreover, by the active movements of the still more highly sensitive  tongue. Close and prolonged contact of these regions, therefore, under  conditions favorable to tumescence sets up a powerful current of nervous  stimulation. After those contacts in which the sexual regions themselves  take a direct part, there is certainly no such channel for directing  nervous force into the sexual sphere as the kiss. This is nowhere so well  recognized as in France, where a young girl's lips are religiously kept  for her lover, to such an extent, indeed, that young girls sometimes come  to believe that the whole physical side of love is comprehended in a kiss  on the mouth; so highly intelligent a woman as Madam Adam has described  the agony she felt as a girl when kissed on the lips by a man, owing to  the conviction that she had thereby lost her virtue. Although the lips  occupy this highly important position as a secondary sexual focus  in the sphere of touch, the kiss is--unlike _cunnilingus_ and  _fellatio_--confined to man and, indeed, to a large extent, to civilized  man. It is the outcome of a compound evolution which had its beginning  outside the sphere of touch, and it would therefore be out of place to  deal with the interesting question of its development in this place. It  will be discussed elsewhere.[18]    There is yet another orificial frontier region which is a highly important  tactile sexual focus: the nipple. The breasts raise, indeed, several  interesting questions in their intimate connection with the sexual sphere  and it may be worth while to consider them at this point.    The breasts have from the present point of view this special significance  among the sexual centres that they primarily exist, not for the contact of  the lover, but the contact of the child. This is doubtless, indeed, the  fundamental fact on which all the touch contacts we are here concerned  with have grown up. The sexual sensitivity of the lover's lips to  orificial contacts has been developed from the sensitivity of the infant's  lips to contact with his mother's nipple. It is on the ground of that  evolution that we are bound to consider here the precise position of the  breasts as a sexual centre.    As the great secreting organs of milk, the function of the breasts must  begin immediately the child is cut off from the nutrition derived from  direct contact with his mother's blood. It is therefore essential that the  connection between the sexual organs proper, more especially the womb, and  the breasts should be exceedingly intimate, so that the breasts may be in  a condition to respond adequately to the demand of the child's sucking  lips at the earliest moment after birth. As a matter of fact, this  connection is very intimate, so intimate that it takes place in two  totally distinct ways--by the nervous system and by the blood.        The breasts of young girls sometimes become tender at puberty in      sympathy with the evolution of the sexual organs, although the      swelling of the breasts at this period is not normally a      glandular process. At the recurring periods of menstruation,      again, sensations in the breasts are not uncommon.        It is not, however, until impregnation occurs that really      decisive changes take place in the breasts. \"As soon as the ovum      is impregnated, that is to say within a few days,\" as W.D.A.      Griffith states it (\"The Diagnosis of Pregnancy,\" _British      Medical Journal_, April 11, 1903), \"the changes begin to occur in      the breast, changes which are just as well worked out as are the      changes in the uterus and the vagina, which, from the      commencement of pregnancy, prepare for the labor which ought to      follow nine months afterward. These are changes in the direction      of marked activity of function. An organ which was previously      quite passive, without activity of circulation and the effects of      active circulation, begins to grow and continues to grow in      activity and size as pregnancy progresses.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13614"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 5 (#7)"],[1,"not so extreme as to be morbid, may perhaps become more intelligible to us  when we realize that in earlier periods of civilization, and even to-day  in some parts of the world, the foot is generally recognized as a focus of  sexual attraction, so that some degree of foot-fetichism becomes a normal  phenomenon.    The most pronounced and the best known example of such normal  foot-fetichism at the present day is certainly to be found among the  Southern Chinese. For a Chinese husband his wife's foot is more  interesting than her face. A Chinese woman is as shy of showing her feet  to a man as a European woman her breasts; they are reserved for her  husband's eyes alone, and to look at a woman's feet in the street is  highly improper and indelicate. Chinese foot-fetichism is connected with  the custom of compressing the feet. This custom appears to rest on the  fact that Chinese women naturally possess a very small foot and is thus an  example of the universal tendency in the search for beauty to accentuate,  even by deformation, the racial characteristics. But there is more than  this. Beauty is largely a name for sexual attractiveness, and the energy  expended in the effort to make the Chinese woman's small foot still  smaller is a measure of the sexual fascination which it exerts. The  practice arose on the basis of the sexual attractiveness of the foot,  though it has doubtless served to heighten that attractiveness, just as  the small waist, which (if we may follow Stratz) is a characteristic  beauty of the European woman, becomes to the average European man still  more attractive when accentuated, even to the extent of deformity, by the  compression of the corset.        Referring to the sexual fascination exerted by the foot in China,      Matignon writes: \"My attention has been drawn to this point by a      large number of pornographic engravings, of which the Chinese are      very fond. In all these lascivious scenes we see the male      voluptuously fondling the woman's foot. When a Celestial takes      into his hand a woman's foot, especially if it is very small, the      effect upon him is precisely the same as is provoked in a      European by the palpation of a young and firm bosom. All the      Celestials whom I have interrogated on this point have replied      unanimously: 'Oh, a little foot! You Europeans cannot understand      how exquisite, how sweet, how exciting it is!' The contact of the      genital organ with the little foot produces in the male an      indescribable degree of voluptuous feeling, and women skilled in      love know that to arouse the ardor of their lovers a better      method than all Chinese aphrodisiacs--including 'giusen' and      swallows' nests--is to take the penis between their feet. It is      not rare to find Chinese Christians accusing themselves at      confession of having had 'evil thoughts on looking at a woman's      foot.'\" (Dr. J. Matignon, \"A propos d'un Pied de Chinoise,\"      _Archives d'Anthropologie Criminelle_, 1898.)        It is said that a Chinese Empress, noted for her vice and having      a congenital club foot, about the year 1100 B.C., desired all      women to resemble her, and that the practice of compressing the      foot thus arose. But this is only tradition, since, in 300 B.C.,      Chinese books were destroyed (Morache, Art. \"Chine,\"      _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des Sciences Medicales_, p. 191). It      is also said that the practice owes its origin to the wish to      keep women indoors. But women are not secluded in China, nor does      foot compression usually render a woman unable to walk. Many      intelligent Chinese are of opinion that its object is to promote      the development of the sexual parts and of the thighs, and so to      aid both intercourse and parturition. There is no ground for      believing that it has any such influence, though Morache found      that the mons veneris and labia are largely developed in Chinese      women, and not in Tartar women living in Pekin (who do not      compress the foot). If there is any correlation between the feet      and the pelvic regions, it is more probably congenital than due      to the artificial compression of the feet. The ancients seem to      have believed that a small foot indicated a small vagina. Restif      de la Bretonne, who had ample opportunities for forming an      opinion on a matter in which he took so great an interest,      believed that a small foot, round and short, indicated a large      vagina (_Monsieur Nicolas_, vol. i, reprint of 1883, p. 92).      Even, however, if we admit that there is a real correlation      between the foot and the vagina, that would by no means suffice      to render the foot a focus of sexual attraction.        It remains the most reasonable view that the foot bandage must be      regarded as strictly analogous to the waist bandage or corset      which also tends to produce deformity of the constricted region.      Stratz has ingeniously remarked (_Frauenkleidung_, third edition,      p. 101) that the success of the Chinese in dwarfing trees may      have suggested a similar attempt in regard to women's feet, and      adds that in any case both dwarfed trees and bound feet bear      witness in the Mongolian to the same love for small and elegant,      not to say deformed, things. For a Chinaman the deformed foot is      a \"golden water-lily.\"        Many facts (together with illustrations) bearing on Chinese      deformation of the foot will be found in Ploss, _Das Weib_, vol.      i, Section IV.    The significance of the sexual emotion aroused by the female foot in China  and the origin of its compression begin to become clear when we realize  that this foot-fetichism is merely an extreme development of a tendency  which is fairly well marked among nearly all the peoples of yellow race.  Jacoby, who has brought together a number of interesting facts bearing on  the sexual significance of the foot, states that a similar tendency is to  be found among the Mongol and Turk peoples of Siberia, and in the east and  central parts of European Russia, among the Permiaks, the Wotiaks, etc.  Here the woman, at all events when young, has always her feet, as well as  head, covered, however little clothing she may otherwise wear.        \"On hot nights or on baking days,\" Jacoby states, \"you may see      these women with uncovered breasts, or even entirely naked      without embarrassment, but you will never see them with bare      feet, and no male relations, except the husband, will ever see      the feet and lower part of the legs of the women in the house.      These women have their modesty in their feet, and also their      coquetry; to unbind the feet of a woman is for a man a voluptuous      act, and the touch of the bands produces the same effect as a      corset still warm from a woman's body on a European man. A      woman's beauty, that which attracts and excites a man, lies in      her foot; in Mordvin love poems celebrating the beauty of women      there is much about her attire, especially her embroidered      chemise, but as regards the charms of her person the poet is      content to state that 'her feet are beautiful;' with that      everything is said. The young peasant woman of the central      provinces as part of her holiday raiment puts on great woolen      stockings which come up to the groin and are then folded over to      below the knee. To uncover the feet of a person of the opposite      sex is a sexual act, and has thus become the symbol of sexual      possession, so that the stocking or foot-gear became the emblem      of marriage, as later the ring. (It was so among the Jews, as we      see in the book of _Ruth_, Chapter III, v. 4, and Chapter IV, vv.      7 and 8). St. Vladimir the Great asked in marriage the daughter      of Prince Rogvold; as Vladimir's mother had been a serf, the      princess proudly replied that she 'would not uncover the feet of      a slave.' At the present time in the east of Russia when a young      girl tries to find out by divination whom she will have as a      husband the traditional formula is 'Come and take my stockings      off.' Among the populations of the north and east, it is      sometimes the bride who must do this for her husband on the      wedding night, and sometimes the bridegroom for his wife, not as      a token of love, but as a nuptial ceremony. Among the      professional classes and small nobility in Russia parents place      money in the stocking of their child at marriage as a present for      the other partner, it being supposed that the couple mutually      remove each other's foot raiment, as an act of sexual possession,      the emblem of coitus.\" (Paul Jacoby, _Archives d'Anthropologie      Criminelle_, December, 1903, p. 793.) The practice among      ourselves of children hanging up their stockings at night for      presents would seem to be a relic of the last-mentioned custom.    While we may witness the sexual symbolism of the foot, with or without an  associated foot-fetichism, most highly developed in Asia and Eastern  Europe, it has by no means been altogether unknown in some stages of  western civilization, and traces of it may be found here and there even  yet. Schinz refers to the connection between the feet and sexual pleasure  as existing not only among the Egyptians and the Arabs, but among the  ancient Germans and the modern Spaniards,[16] while Jacoby points out that  among the Greeks, the Romans, and especially the Etruscans, it was usual  to represent chaste and virgin goddesses with their feet covered, even  though they might be otherwise nude. Ovid, again, is never weary of  dwelling on the sexual charm of the feminine foot. He represents the  chaste matron as wearing a weighted _stola_ which always fell so as to  cover her feet; it was only the courtesan, or the nymph who is taking part  in an erotic festival, who"]]]
