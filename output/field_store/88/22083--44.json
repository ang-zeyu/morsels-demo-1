He  claims that the microscope reveals the development in a previously  clear liquid of very minute black spots, which gradually enlarge and  transform into bacteria--living forms of a very low order. Prof. Burke,  of Cambridge, Eng., has demonstrated that he may produce in sterilized  boullion, subjected to the action of sterilized radium chloride, minute  living bodies which manifest growth and subdivision. Science is being  gradually forced to the conclusion that living forms are still arising  in the world by natural processes, which is not at all remarkable when  one remembers that natural law is uniform and continuous. These recent  discoveries go to swell the already large list of modern scientific  ideas which correspond with the centuries-old Yogi teachings. When the  Occult explanation that there is Life in everything, _inorganic as well  as organic_, and that evolution is constant, is heard, then may we see  that these experiments simply prove that the forms of life may be  changed and developed--not that Life may be \"created.\"    The chemical and mineral world furnish us with many instances of the  growth and development of forms closely resembling the forms of the  vegetable world. What is known as \"metallic vegetation,\" as shown in  the \"lead tree,\" gives us an interesting example of this phenomenon.  The experiment is performed by placing in a wide-necked bottle a clear  acidulated solution of acetate of lead. The bottle is corked, a piece  of copper wire being fastened to the cork, from which wire is suspended  a piece of zinc, the latter hanging as nearly as possible in the center  of the lead solution. When the bottle is corked the copper wire  immediately begins to surround itself with a growth of metallic lead  resembling fine moss. From this moss spring branches and limbs, which  in turn manifest a growth similar to foliage, until at last a miniature  bush or tree is formed. Similar \"metallic vegetation\" may be produced  by other metallic solutions.    All of you have noticed how crystals of frost form on window panes in  shapes of leaves, branches, foliage, flowers, blossoms, etc. Saltpeter  when subjected to the effect of polarized light assumes forms closely  resembling the forms of the orchid. Nature is full of these  resemblances.    A German scientist recently performed a remarkable experiment with  certain metallic salts. He subjected the salts to the action of a  galvanic current, when to his surprise the particles of the salts  grouped themselves around the negative pole of the battery, and then  grew into a shape closely resembling a miniature mushroom, with tiny  stem and umbrella top. These metallic mushrooms at first presented a  transparent appearance, but gradually developed color, the top of the  umbrella being a bright red, with a faint rose shade on the under  surface. The stems showed a pale straw color. This was most  interesting, but the important fact of the experiment consists in the  discovery that these mushrooms have fine veins or tubes running along  the stems, through which the nourishment, or additional material for  growth, is transported, so that the growth is actually from the inside,  just as is the case with fungus life. To all intents and purposes,  these inorganic metallic growths were low forms of vegetable his.    But the search for Life does not end with the forms of the mineral  world as we know them. Science has separated the material forms into  smaller forms, and again still smaller. And if there is Life in the  form composed of countless particles, then must there be Life in the  particles themselves. For Life cannot come from non-Life, and if there  be not Life in the particles, the theory of Omnipresent Life must fan.  So we must look beyond the form and shape of the mineral--mist separate  it into its constituent parts, and then examine the parts for  indications of Life.    Science teaches us that all forms of matter are compiled of minute  particles called molecules. A molecule is the smallest particle of  matter that is possible, unless the chemical atoms composing the matter  fly apart and the matter be resolved into its original elements. For  instance, let us take the familiar instance of a drop of water. Let us  divide and subdivide the drop, until at last we get to the smallest  possible particle of water. That smallest possible particle would be a  \"molecule\" of water. We cannot subdivide this molecule without causing  its atoms of hydrogen and oxygen to fly apart--and then there would be  no _water_ at all. Well, these molecules manifest a something called  Attraction for each other. They attract other molecules of the same  kind, and are likewise attracted. The operation of this law of  attraction results in the formation of masses of matter, whether those  masses be mountains of solid rock, or a drop of water, or a volume of  gas. All masses of matter are composed of aggregations of molecules,  held together by the law of attraction. This law of attraction is  called Cohesion. This Cohesive Attraction is not a mere mechanical  force, as many suppose, but is an exhibition of Life action,  manifesting in the presence of the molecule of a \"like\" or \"love\" for  the similar molecule. And when the Life energies begin to manifest on a  certain plane, and proceed to mould the molecules into crystals, so  that we may see the actual process under way, we begin to realize very  clearly that there is \"something at work\" in this building up.    But wonderful as this may seem to those unfamiliar with the idea, the  manifestation of Life among the atoms is still more so. The atom, you  will remember, is the chemical unit which, uniting with other atoms,  makes up the molecule. For instance, if we take two atoms of the gas  called hydrogen and one atom of the gas called oxygen, and place them  near each other, they will at once rush toward each other and form a  partnership, which is called a molecule of water. And so it is with all  atoms--they are continually forming partnerships, or dissolving them.  Marriage and divorce is a part of the life of the atoms. These  evidences of attraction and repulsion among the atoms are receiving  much attention from careful thinkers, and some of the most advanced  minds of the age see in this phenomena the corroboration of the old  Yogi idea that there is Life and vital action in the smallest particles  of matter.    The atoms manifest vital characteristics in their attractions and  repulsions. They move along the lines of their attractions and form  marriages, and thus combining they form the substances with which we  are familiar. When they combine, remember, they do not lose their  individuality and melt into a permanent substance, but merely unite and  yet remain distinct. If the combination be destroyed by chemical  action, electrical discharge, etc., the atoms fly apart, and again live  their own separate lives, until they come in contact with other atoms  with which they have affinities, and form a new union or partnership.  In many chemical changes the atoms divorce themselves, each forsaking  its mate or mates, and seeking some newer affinity in the shape of a  more congenial atom. The atoms manifest a fickleness and will always  desert a lesser attraction for a greater one. This is no mere bit of  imagery, or scientific poetry. It is a scientific statement of the  action of atoms along the lines of vital manifestation.    The great German scientist, Haekel, has said: \"I cannot imagine the  simplest chemical and physical processes without attributing the  movement of the material particles to unconscious sensation. The idea  of Chemical Affinity consists in the fact that the various chemical  elements perceive differences in the qualities of other elements, and  experience pleasure or revulsion at contact with them, and execute  their respective movements on this ground.\" He also says: \"We may  ascribe the feeling of pleasure or pain (satisfaction or  dissatisfaction) to all atoms, and thereby ascribe the elective  affinities of chemistry to the attraction between living atoms and  repulsion between hating atoms.\" He also says that \"the sensations in  animal and plant life are connected by a long series of evolutionary  stages with the simpler forms of sensation that we find in the  inorganic elements, and that reveal themselves in chemical affinity.\"  Naegli says: \"If the molecules possess something that is related,  however distantly, to sensation, it must be comfortable for them to be  able to follow their attractions and repulsions, and uncomfortable for  them when they are forced to do otherwise.\"    We might fill page after page with quotations from eminent thinkers  going to prove the correctness of the old Yogi teachings that Life is  Omnipresent. Modern Science is rapidly advancing to this position,  leaving behind her the old idea of \"dead matter.\" Even the new theories  of the electron--the little particles of electrical energy which are  now believed to constitute the base of the atom--does not change this  idea, for the electrons manifest attraction, and response thereto, and  form themselves into groups composing the atom. And even if we pass  beyond matter into the mystical Ether which Science assumes to be the  material base of things, we must believe that there is life there too,  and that as Prof. Dolbear says: \"The Ether has besides the function of  energy and motion, other inherent properties, out of which could  emerge, under proper circumstances, other phenomena, such as life,  mind, or whatever may be in the substratum,\" and, that as Prof. Cope  has hinted, that the basis of Life lies back of the atoms and may be  found in the Universal Ether.    Some scientists go even further, and assert that not only is Life  present in everything, but that Mind is present where Life is. Verily,  the dreams of the Yogi fathers are coming true, and from the ranks of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13444"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: The Science of Eugenics (#7)"],[1,"mighty evils herein stigmatized! It would work a  revolution for which coming society could never cease to be grateful.    7. STRIVE TO ATTAIN A HIGHER LIFE.--Strive to attain unto a higher  and better life. Beware of all excesses, of whatever nature, and guard  your personal purity with sacred determination. Let every aspiration  be upward, and be strong in every good, resolution. Seek the light,  for in light there is life, while in darkness there is decay and  death.    [Illustration: THE FIRST LOVE LETTER.]    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    HOW TO WRITE ALL KINDS OF LETTERS.      1. From the President in his cabinet to the laborer in the street;  from the lady in her parlor to the servant in her kitchen; from the  millionaire to the beggar; from the emigrant to the settler; from  every country and under every combination of circumstances, letter  writing in all its forms and varieties is most important to the  advancement, welfare and happiness of the human family.    2. EDUCATION.--The art of conveying thought through the medium of  written language is so valuable and so necessary, a thorough knowledge  of the practice must be desirable to every one. For merely to write a  good letter requires the exercise of much of the education and talent  of any writer.    3. A GOOD LETTER.--A good letter must be correct in every mechanical  detail, finished in style, interesting in substance, and intelligible  in construction. Few there are who do not need write them; yet  a letter perfect in detail is rarer than any other specimen of  composition.    4. PENMANSHIP.--It is folly to suppose that the faculty for writing a  good hand is confined to any particular persons. There is no one who  can write at all, but what can write well, if only the necessary pains  are practiced. Practice makes perfect. Secure a few copy books and  write an hour each day. You will soon write a good hand.    5. WRITE PLAINLY.--Every word of even the most trifling document  should be written in such clear characters that it would be impossible  to mistake it for another word, or the writer may find himself in the  position of the Eastern merchant who, writing to the Indies for five  thousand mangoes, received by the next vessel five hundred monkies,  with a promise of more in the next cargo.    6. HASTE.--Hurry is no excuse for bad writing, because any one of  sense knows that everything hurried is liable to be ruined. Dispatch  may be acquired, but hurry will ruin everything. If, however, you must  write slowly to write well, then be careful not to hurry at all, for  the few moments you will gain by rapid writing will never compensate  you for the disgrace of sending an ill-written letter.    7. NEATNESS.--Neatness is also of great importance. A fair white sheet  with handsomely written words will be more welcome to any reader than  a blotted, bedaubed page covered with erasures and dirt, even if  the matter in each be of equal value and interest. Erasures, blots,  interlineations always spoil the beauty of any letter.    8. BAD SPELLING.--When those who from faulty education, or  forgetfulness are doubtful about the correct spelling of any word,  it is best to keep a dictionary at hand, and refer to it upon such  occasions. It is far better to spend a few moments in seeking for a  doubtful word, than to dispatch an ill-spelled letter, and the  search will probably impress the spelling upon the mind for a future  occasion.    9. CARELESSNESS.--Incorrect spelling will expose the most important  or interesting letter to the severest sarcasm and ridicule. However  perfect in all other respects, no epistle that is badly spelled will  be regarded as the work of an educated gentleman or lady. Carelessness  will never be considered, and to be ignorant of spelling is to expose  an imperfect education at once.    10. AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE.--After writing a letter, read it over  carefully, correct all the errors and re-write it. If you desire to  become a good letter writer, improve your penmanship, improve your  language and grammar, re-writing once or twice every letter that you  have occasion to write, whether on social or business subjects.    11. PUNCTUATION.--A good rule for punctuation is to punctuate where  the sense requires it, after writing a letter and reading it over  carefully you will see where the punctuation marks are required, you  can readily determine where the sense requires it, so that your letter  will convey the desired meaning.    [Illustration]    12. CORRESPONDENCE.--There is no better school or better source for  self-improvement than a pleasant correspondence between friends. It  is not at all difficult to secure a good list of correspondents if  desired. The young people who take advantage of such opportunities  for self-improvement will be much more popular in the community and in  society. Letter writing cultivates the habit of study; it cultivates  the mind, the heart, and stimulates self-improvement in general.    13. FOLDING.--Another bad practice with those unaccustomed to  corresponding is to fold the sheet of writing in such a fantastic  manner as to cause the receiver much annoyance in opening it. To the  sender it may appear a very ingenious performance, but to the receiver  it is only a source of vexation and annoyance, and may prevent the  communication receiving the attention it would otherwise merit.    14. SIMPLE STYLE.--The style of letter writing should be simple and  unaffected, not raised on stilts and indulging in pedantic displays  which are mostly regarded as cloaks of ignorance. Repeated literary  quotations, involved sentences, long-sounding words and scraps of  Latin, French and other languages are, generally speaking, out of  place, and should not be indulged in.    15. THE RESULT.--A well written letter has opened the way to  prosperity for many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and  constant friendship, and has secured many a good service in time of  need; for it is in some measure a photograph of the writer, and may  inspire love or hatred, regard or aversion in the reader, just as  the glimpse of a portrait often determine us, in our estimate, of  the worth of the person represented. Therefore, one of the roads  to fortune runs through the ink bottle, and if we want to attain a  certain end in love, friendship or business, we must trace out the  route correctly with the pen in our hand.    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    HOW TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER.      1. LOVE.--There is no greater or more profound reality than love. Why  that reality should be obscured by mere sentimentalism, with all  its train of absurdities is incomprehensible. There is no nobler  possession than the love of another. There is no higher gift from one  human being to another than love. The gift and the possession are true  sanctifiers of life, and should be worn as precious jewels, without  affectation and without bashfulness. For this reason there is nothing  to be ashamed of in a love letter, provided it be sincere.    2. FORFEITS.--No man need consider that he forfeits dignity if he  speaks with his whole heart: no woman need fear she forfeits her  womanly attributes if she responds as her heart bids her respond.  \"Perfect love casteth out fear\" is as true now as when the maxim was  first given to the world.    3. TELLING THEIR LOVE.--The generality of the sex is, love to be  loved; how are they to know the fact that they are loved unless they  are told? To write a sensible love letter requires more talent than  to solve, with your pen, a profound problem in philosophy. Lovers must  not then expect much from each other's epistles.    4. CONFIDENTIAL.--Ladies and gentlemen who correspond with each other  should never be guilty of exposing any of the contents of any letters  written expressing confidence, attachment or love. The man who  confides in a lady and honors her with his confidence should be  treated with perfect security and respect, and those who delight in  showing their confidential letters to others are unworthy, heartless  and unsafe companions.    5. RETURN OF LETTERS.--If letters were written under circumstances  which no longer exist and all confidential relations are at an end,  then all letters should be promptly returned.    6. HOW TO BEGIN A LOVE LETTER.--How to begin a love letter has been no  doubt the problem of lovers and suitors of all ages and nations. Fancy  the youth of Young America with lifted pen, thinking how he shall  address his beloved. Much depends upon this letter. What shall he say,  and how shall he say it, is the great question. Perseverance, however,  will solve the problem and determine results.    7. FORMS OF BEGINNING A LOVE LETTER.--Never say, \"My Dearest Nellie,\"  \"My Adored Nellie,\" or \"My Darling Nellie,\" until Nellie has first  called you \"My Dear,\" or has given you to understand that such  familiar terms are permissible. As a rule a gentleman will never  err if he says \"Dear Miss Nellie,\" and if the letters are cordially  reciprocated the \"Miss\" may in time be omitted, or other familiar  terms used instead. In addressing a widow \"Dear Madam,\" or, \"My Dear  Madam,\" will be a proper form until sufficient intimacy will justify  the use of other terms.    8. RESPECT.--A lady must always be treated with respectful delicacy,  and a gentleman should never use the term \"Dear\" or \"My Dear\" under  any circumstances unless he knows it is perfectly acceptable or a long  and friendly acquaintance justifies it.    9. HOW TO FINISH A LETTER.--A letter will be suggested by the remarks  on how to begin one. \"Yours respectfully,\" \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours  sincerely,\" \"Yours affectionately,\" \"Yours ever affectionately,\"  \"Yours most affectionately,\" \"Ever yours,\" \"Ever your own,\" or  \"Yours,\" are all appropriate, each depending upon the beginning of the  letter. It is difficult to see any phrase which could be added "]]]
