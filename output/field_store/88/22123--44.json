His numerous marriages afforded experience which led to the  framing of many \"divine\" laws referring to women. As has already been  hinted, Kadijah, his first wife, exercised considerable influence over  his prophetic career. She evidently had a strong affection for him,  which feeling was heartily reciprocated. She had a personality strong  enough to curb his natural passion, and to preserve her place in spite  of it in his regard. Her encouragement and support when success and  failure were trembling in the balance, urged him to persist in the  development of his ideas. He was faithful to her during their married  life, and to her memory afterwards, and promised her, upon her  deathbed, that she should share his heavenly chamber after his death,  with the Mother of Jesus and the sister of Moses. Within a month of  her death he was betrothed to Ayesha, a child of seven. He did not  actually marry her until she was nine years of age, and during the  interval consoled himself by wedding a widow who had acted as nurse to  one of his daughters. This marriage seems to have been more a matter  of convenience than of affection on his part, and in later days she  was able to keep her position as his wife only by the yielding of  certain of her privileges to other members of the harem.    Seven months after his arrival in Medinah, during the time of poverty,  the marriage with Ayesha was celebrated, the child of nine being  united to the man of fifty-three! a marriage defended on the ground of  political expediency, whereby the devotion of Abu Bakr, the child's  father was strengthened. She seems to have been second only to  Khadijah in the prophet's affections, and exercised a petty tyranny  over him, which was submitted to even when it affected his  revelations. She excited the envy of the other wives because of her  privileges, and in spite of intrigue, was able to hold her own. She  was extremely sarcastic in regard to some of the revelations, and even  went so far on one occasion as to jeer the prophet on his faithfulness  in recording them. This sarcasm was prompted by jealousy, because of  Mohammed's marriage with Zainab, which was so illegal as to cause him  to throw the responsibility on God. Zainab was the wife of the  prophet's adopted son Zaid, who, having discovered his foster-father's  love, thought it wise to divorce her in his favour. The revelation  Mohammed produced seems to have been held over until his critics had  been mollified by some victory--hence the sarcasm!    During the raiding of the Jews, Mohammed was considerably disturbed by  the desire of the wives to accompany him on the expeditions. He eased  the difficulty by arranging that one only should go with him on each  expedition, and should obtain the favour by lot. Ayesha got into  difficulty on one of these expeditions. She dropped a necklace and  remained behind the returning party in order to seek for it. A youth  who, too, had loitered behind, found it, and accompanied her back to  the camp. Her enemies were not slow to take advantage of this incident  to prejudice her before the prophet. He was deeply hurt, and in face  of the surge of public opinion, sent her back to her parents. The  complications arising out of the divorce would probably have alienated  the sympathies of Abu Bakr, her father, so with his usual diplomacy,  Mohammed produced a revelation, in which God declared Ayesha innocent  of any cause for divorce! It was through Ayesha, too, that the prophet  conceived the idea of praying for deliverance from the torment of the  grave, for she casually remarked one day that she had heard a Jewish  woman speaking about torment after death. Through all her life with  the prophet she proved herself to be strong in character, and a  fitting mate for a man of Mohammed's type.    Other wives did not play such an important part in the prophet's life  work. He seems to have exhibited his taste for beauty in all his  selections. Keud was the daughter of a man of considerable wealth and  influence, and, like Zainab, was one of the Abyssinian refugees. In  the expedition against Khaibah, Mohammed's greed was excited by the  sight of some valuable ornaments belonging to one of his vanquished  enemies. He sought to gain possession of them by marrying the daughter  of the owner, Safiyyah, whose husband and brother had both been killed  in the battle that had been fought. She accepted the prophet's offer,  and contented herself for her losses in the squabbles of his harem.  His other wives were Juwairijah, Hafsah, Um Salmah, Um Kabibah,  another of the Abyssinian refugees, and Zainab, widow of his cousin.  The last wife was Maimunah, who is said to have offered herself to him  when he was considering the invasion of Mecca. A Coptic (Christian)  slave girl, Mary, and Rihanah, a Jewess, were added to the harem, but  went through no form of marriage with him. Mary was sent as a present  from one of the Coptic rulers in answer to the prophet's letter,  urging the claims of Islam; while Rihanah, whose husband was one of  the many who were cruelly slaughtered by decapitation after a victory  over the Jews, was at nightfall, almost immediately after the  massacre, taken to the prophet's tent. It is evident that the prophet  had many opportunities of still further increasing his harem, for many  women offered themselves; while the relatives of handsome widows would  make no arrangements for the re-marriage of the bereaved ones until  they had been offered to the prophet and refused.    It cannot be expected that things could always run smoothly with so  many women possessing rights to his attention, and there is much  evidence to show that Mohammed was often disturbed by the difficulty  of pleasing all. His relations to the feminine sex, as may be  expected, led to a very low estimate of the position of women. Hence  the utter degradation to which they are subjected in Islam. Although  he did not practice it, he sanctioned wife beating. Divorce was made  easy for the men, who could cast off their wives any time they so  desired. Thus it is quite common to-day for women to steal from their  husbands in order to provide for themselves in case of divorce. The  evil of such a system is apparent. It makes the women mere slaves at  the mercy of the caprice of their husbands. The polygamy and  concubinage which is sanctioned in the Koran, has degraded the women  to a degree that may be imagined, and certainly has not, as some  authorities contend, abolished other evils. It is true that he  improved slightly the condition of women in his day, giving them  privileges they had not up to that time enjoyed, and by those who  endeavour to picture him as a hero, his failure to arrive at a true  estimate of the position of women is covered by the statement that it  was impossible for him to grapple with a hopeless problem. It is  encouraging to know that, with the growing influence of Western  Christian civilisation, the condition of women in Moslem lands is  gradually improving, although the village folk still consider us to be  weak in character because we are courteous in our behaviour to them.  In Egypt, Government schools for girls are being organised, and  throughout the whole Moslem world education is spreading. The religion  of Mohammed is so clearly defined that it can never be reformed. The  only hope for the nations that are under its sway is that with the  advance of western civilisation there may be a yielding to the  influence of Christianity. It cannot be possible to enjoy the  blessings of the West while men are tyrannised by a non-progressive  religion of the East.    Just before he died Mohammed organised an expedition against the  Romans, and this in spite of sickness unto death. He had made his last  pilgrimage to Mecca, and had delivered what may be termed his final  charge to his followers. The whole tone of his address seems to have  been influenced by the thought of the proximity of death. He  emphasised the doctrines he had inculcated, showing that the Islamic  brotherhood removed all that tended to social inequality. The rich man  was no better than the poor; the aristocrat who boasted of his  ancestry, no more important in the sight of God than the lowliest  beggar. The only difference that could exist between man and man was a  difference in degree of piety. Property rights he recognised as  regarding believers, and evidently implied that unbelievers possessed  no such rights. He asked respect and humane treatment for women, and  undoubtedly manifested a desire for a better condition of affairs than  he in his lifetime had been able to establish. The subsequent illness  was probably due to the strain and anxiety of this pilgrimage. Ayesha,  the girl wife, tended him. The many stories that have been told of  these last days are not at all reliable, but it is certain that for  five days he was quite helpless and delirious. On the 7th of June, 632  A.D., ten years after the flight from Mecca, he died in the arms of  Ayesha, leaving a work that wrought havoc in the Christian Church for  centuries, and which, inspired by his immortal spirit, still exists in  unyielding enmity against the faith of the meek and lowly Nazarene,  whose native soil, in the providence of God, is owned by Islam's son.  Never again will be heard the clash of steel on steel as Christian  tries to vanquish Moslem. Those days are happily past and gone. Carnal  weapons cannot avail against spiritual forces. The eternal, peaceable  Spirit of Jesus is slowly but surely permeating the gloom of Islam. We  see the resultant disintegration, and hope for that great day when,  led by the broken and contrite spirit of their leader, the hosts of  Islam shall bow before the King of Kings, recognising what, in time,  they were impelled to deny--Unity in Trinity, the at present  unrevealed mystery of Deity.    Britain, the greatest Moslem power of the world,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14065"],[0,"The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard (#7)"],[1,"too Evident, the most reasonable  Conjecture that has hierto been made, is, that the first Act was his  twisting and breaking assunder by the strength of his Hands a small Iron  Chain, which together with a great Horse Padlock, (as went from the  heavy Fetters about his Legs to the staples) confin'd him to the Floor,  and with a Nail open'd the Padlock and set himself at Liberty about the  Room: A large flat Iron Bar appears to have been taken out of the  Chimney, with the Assistance thereof 'tis plain he broke thro' a Wall of  many Foot in Thickness, and made his way from the _Castle_ into another  strong Room Contiguous, the Door of it not having been open'd since  several of the _Preston_ Prisoners were Confin'd there about seven Years  ago: Three Screws are visibly taken off of the Lock, and the Doors as  strong as Art could make them, forc'd open. The Locks and Bolts, either  wrench'd or Broke, and the Cases and other Irons made for their Security  cut assunder: An Iron Spike broke off from the Hatch in the _Chapel_,  which he fix'd in the Wall and fasten'd his Blanket to it, to drop on  the Leads of Mr. _Bird_'s House, his Stockings were found on the Leads  of _Newgate_; 'tis question'd whether sixty Pounds will repair the  Damage done to the Jayl.    It will perhaps be inquir'd how all this could be perform'd without his  being heard by the Prisoners or the Keepers; 'tis well known that the  Place of his Confinement is in the upper part of the Prison, none of the  other Felons being Kept any where near him; and 'tis suppos'd that if  any had heard him at Work, they would rather have facilitated, than  frustrated his Endeavours. In the Course of his Breaches he pass'd by a  Door on his Left belonging to the _Common-Side_ Felons, who have since  Curs'd him heartily for his not giving them an opportunity to kiss his  Hand, and lending them a favourable lift when his Hand was in; but that  was not a Work proper for Mr. _Sheppard_ to do in his then  Circumstances.    His Fetters are not to be found any where about the Jayl, from whence  'tis concluded he has either thrown them down some Chimney, or carried  them off on his Legs, the latter seems to be Impracticable, and would  still render his Escaping in such Manner the more astonishing; and the  only Answer that is given to the whole, at _Newgate_ is, _That the_  Devil _came in Person and assisted him_.    He undoubtedly perform'd most of these Wonders in the darkest part of  the Night, and without the least Glimpse of a Candle; a word, he has  actually done with his own Hands in a few Hours, what several of the  most skilful Artists allow, could not have been acted by a number of  Persons furnish'd with proper Implements, and all other Advantages in a  full Day.    Never was there anything better Tim'd, the Keepers and all their  Assistants being obliged to a strict Attendance on the Sessions at the  _Old Bailey_, which held for about a Week; and _Blewskin_ having  confin'd _Jonathan Wild_ to his Chamber, a more favourable opportunity  could not have presented for Mr. _Sheppard's_ Purposes.    The Jaylors suffer'd much by the Opinion the ignorant Part of the People  entertain'd of the Matter, and nothing would satisfie some, but that  they not only Conniv'd at, but even assisted him in breaking their own  Walls and Fences, and that for this Reason too, _viz._ That he should be  at Liberty to instruct and train up others in his Method of  House-Breaking; and replenish the Town with a new set of Rogues, to  supply the Places of those Transported beyond Sea.    This is indeed a fine way of Judging, the well-known Characters of Mr.  _Pitt_, and his Deputies, are sufficient to wipe of such ridiculous  Imputations; and 'tis a most lamentable Truth, that they have  often-times had in their Charge Villains of the deepest Die; Persons of  Quality and great Worth, for whom no Entreaties, no Sums how large  soever have been able to interfere between the doleful Prison, and the  fatal Tree.    The Officers have done their Duty, they are but Men, and have had to  deal with a Creature something more than Man, a _Protoeus_,  Supernatural, Words cannot describe him, his Actions and Workmanship  which are too visible, best testifie him.    On _Saturday_ the 17th, _Joseph Blake_, alias _Blewskin_, came upon his  Tryal at the _Old Bailey_: _Field_ gave the same Evidence against him,  as he had formerly done against _Sheppard_; and the Prisoner making but  a triffling Defence, the Jury found him Guilty of Buglary and Felony.  The Criminal when the Verdict was brought in, made his Obeysances to the  Court, _and thank'd them for their Kindness_.    It will be necessary that we now return to the Behaviour of Mr.  _Sheppard_, some few Days before his last Flight.    Mr. _Figg_ the famous Prize Fighter comeing to see him, in _NEWGATE_,  there past some pleasant Raillery between them; and after Mr. _Figg_ was  gone, _Sheppard_ declared he had a Mind to send him a formal Challenge  to Fight him at all the Weapons in the strong Room; and that let the  Consequence be what it would, he should call at Mr. _Figg's_ House in  his way to Execution, and drink a merry Glass with him by way of  Reconciliation.    A young Woman an Acquaintance of his Mother, who wash'd his Linnen and  brought him Necessaries, having in an Affray, got her Eyes beaten Black  and Blue; says _Sheppard_ to her, _How long hast thou been Married_?  Replyes the Wench. _I wonder you can ask me such a Question, when you so  well know the Contrary_: Nay, says _Sheppard_ again, Sarah _don't deny  it, for you have gotten your Certificate in your Face_.    Mr. _Ireton_ a Bailiff in _Drury-Lane_ having pursued _Sheppard_ after  his Escape from the Condemn'd-Hold with uncommon Diligence; (for the  safety of that Neighbourhood which was the chief Scene of his  Villainies) _Sheppard_ when Re-taken, declared, he would be even with  him for it, and if ever he procur'd his Liberty again, _he would give  all his Prisoners an_ ACT OF GRACE. A Gentleman in a jocose way ask'd  him to come and take a Dinner with him, _Sheppard_ reply'd, _he accepted  of the Invitation, and perhaps might take an opportunity to wait on  him_; and there is great Reason to believe he has been as good as his  Word.    He would complain of his Nights, as saying, _It was dark with him from  Five in the Evening, till Seven in the Morning_; and being not permitted  to have either a Bed or Candle, his Circumstances were dismal; and that  he never slept but had some confus'd Doses, he said he consider'd all  this with the Temper of a Philosopher.    Neither his sad Circumstances, nor the solemn Exhortations of the  several Divines who visited him, were able to divert him from this  ludicrous way of Expression; he said, _They were all Ginger-bread  Fellows_, and came rather out of Curiosity, than Charity; and to form  _Papers_ and _Ballads_ out of his Behaviour.    A _Welch_ Clergyman who came pretty often, requested him in a  particularly Manner to refrain Drinking; (tho' indeed there was no  necessity for that Caution) _Sheppard_ says, Doctor, _You set an Example  and I'll follow_; this was a smart Satyr and Repartee upon the _Parson_,  some Circumstances consider'd.    When he was visited in the _Castle_ by the Reverend Mr. _Wagstaff_, he  put on the Face only of a Preparation for his End, as appear'd by his  frequent Attempts made upon his Escape, and when he has been press'd to  Discover those who put him upon Means of Escaping, and furnish'd him  with Implements, he would passionately, and with a Motion of striking,  say, _ask me no such Questions, one File's worth all the Bibles in the  World_.    When ask'd if he had not put off all Thoughts of an Escape and  Entertain'd none but those of Death, would Answer by way of Question,  not directly, whether they thought it possible, or probable for him to  Effect his Release, when Manackled in the manner he was. When mov'd to  improve the few Minutes that seem'd to remain of his Life; he did indeed  listen to, but not regard the Design and Purport of his Admonition,  breaking in with something New of his own, either with respect to his  former Accomplices, or Actions, and all too with Pleasure and Gayety of  Expression.    When in _Chapel_, he would seemingly make his Responses with Devotion;  but would either Laugh, or force Expressions (when as an Auditor of the  Sermon) be of Contempt, either of the Preacher, or of his Discourse.    In fine, he behav'd so, in Word, and Action, (since retaken) that  demonstrated to the World, that his Escape was the utmost Employ of his  Thoughts, whatever Face of Penitence he put on when visited by the  Curious.           An Account of SHEPPARD'S Adventures of five Hours immediately       after his Escape from _Newgate_, in a Letter to his Friend.         DEAR FRIEND!
