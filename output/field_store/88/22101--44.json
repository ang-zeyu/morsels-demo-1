[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#7)"],[1," idea  of his secretary leaving his post or neglecting his duty in pursuit of  sport or out of youthful hilarity and frivolity.    As Gerard was long in coming, the patient Hans--his employer's eye being  no longer on him improved the time by quaffing solemnly, silently, and  at short but accurately measured intervals, goblets of Corsican wine.  The wine was strong, so was Cloterman's head; and Gerard had been gone  a good hour ere the model secretary imbibed the notion that Creation  expected Cloterman to drink the health of all good fellows, and  nommement of the Duke of Burgundy there present. With this view he  filled bumper nine, and rose gingerly but solemnly and slowly. Having  reached his full height, he instantly rolled upon the grass, goblet  in hand, spilling the cold liquor on more than one ankle--whose owners  frisked--but not disturbing a muscle in his own long face, which, in  the total eclipse of reason, retained its gravity, primness, and  infallibility.    The seneschal led Gerard through several passages to the door of the  pavilion, where some young noblemen, embroidered and feathered, sat  sentinel, guarding the heir-apparent, and playing cards by the red light  of torches their servants held. A whisper from the seneschal, and one  of them rose reluctantly, stared at Gerard with haughty surprise, and  entered the pavilion. He presently returned, and, beckoning the pair,  led then, through a passage or two and landed them in an ante-chamber,  where sat three more young gentlemen, feathered, furred, and embroidered  like pieces of fancy work, and deep in that instructive and edifying  branch of learning, dice.    \"You can't see the Princess--it is too late,\" said one.    Another followed suit:    \"She passed this way but now with her nurse. She is gone to bed, doll  and all. Deuce--ace again!\"    Gerard prepared to retire. The seneschal, with an incredulous smile,  replied:    \"The young man is here by the Countess's orders; be so good as conduct  him to her ladies.\"    On this a superb Adonis rose, with an injured look, and led Gerard into  a room where sat or lolloped eleven ladies, chattering like magpies.  Two, more industrious than the rest, were playing cat's-cradle with  fingers as nimble as their tongues. At the sight of a stranger all the  tongues stopped like one piece of complicated machinery, and all the  eyes turned on Gerard, as if the same string that checked the tongues  had turned the eyes on. Gerard was ill at ease before, but this battery  of eyes discountenanced him, and down went his eyes on the ground. Then  the cowards finding, like the hare who ran by the pond and the frogs  scuttled into the water, that there was a creature they could frighten,  giggled and enjoyed their prowess. Then a duenna said severely,  \"Mesdames!\" and they were all abashed at once as though a modesty string  had been pulled. This same duenna took Gerard, and marched before him  in solemn silence. The young man's heart sank, and he had half a mind to  turn and run out of the place.    \"What must princes be,\" he thought, \"when their courtiers are so  freezing? Doubtless they take their breeding from him they serve.\" These  reflections were interrupted by the duenna suddenly introducing him into  a room where three ladies sat working, and a pretty little girl tuning  a lute. The ladies were richly but not showily dressed, and the duenna  went up to the one who was hemming a kerchief, and said a few words in  a low tone. This lady then turned towards Gerard with a smile, and  beckoned him to come near her. She did not rise, but she laid aside her  work, and her manner of turning towards him, slight as the movement was,  was full of grace and ease and courtesy. She began a conversation at  once.    \"Margaret Van Eyck is an old friend of mine, sir, and I am right glad to  have a letter from her hand, and thankful to you, sir, for bringing it  to me safely. Marie, my love, this is the gentleman who brought you that  pretty miniature.\"    \"Sir, I thank you a thousand times,\" said the young lady.    \"I am glad you feel her debtor, sweetheart, for our friend would have us  to do him a little service in return.    \"I will do anything on earth for him,\" replied the young lady with  ardour.    \"Anything on earth is nothing in the world,\" said the Countess of  Charolois quietly.    \"Well, then, I will--What would you have me to do, sir?\"    Gerard had just found out what high society he was in. \"My sovereign  demoiselle,\" said he, gently and a little tremulously, \"where there have  been no pains, there needs no reward.\"    But we must obey mamma. All the world must obey    \"That is true. Then, our demoiselle, reward me, if you will by letting  me hear the stave you were going to sing and I did interrupt it.\"    \"What! you love music, sir?\"    \"I adore it.\"    The little princess looked inquiringly at her mother, and received a  smile of assent. She then took her lute and sang a romaunt of the day.  Although but twelve years old, she was a well-taught and painstaking  musician. Her little claw swept the chords with Courage and precision,  and struck out the notes of the arpeggio clear, and distinct, and  bright, like twinkling stars; but the main charm was her voice. It was  not mighty, but it was round, clear, full, and ringing like a bell. She  sang with a certain modest eloquence, though she knew none of the tricks  of feeling. She was too young to be theatrical, or even sentimental,  so nothing was forced--all gushed. Her little mouth seemed the mouth of  Nature. The ditty, too, was as pure as its utterance. As there were none  of those false divisions--those whining slurs, which are now sold so  dear by Italian songsters, though every jackal in India delivers them  gratis to his customers all night, and sometimes gets shot for them, and  always deserves it--so there were no cadences and fiorituri, the trite,  turgid, and feeble expletives of song, the skim-milk with which mindless  musicians and mindless writers quench fire, wash out colour, and drown  melody and meaning dead.    While the pure and tender strain was flowing from the pure young throat,  Gerard's eyes filled. The Countess watched him with interest, for it  was usual to applaud the Princess loudly, but not with cheek and eye.  So when the voice ceased, and the glasses left off ringing, she asked  demurely, \"Was he content?\"    Gerard gave a little start; the spoken voice broke a charm and brought  him back to earth.    \"Oh, madam!\" he cried, \"surely it is thus that cherubs and seraphs sing,  and charm the saints in heaven.\"    \"I am somewhat of your opinion, my young friend,\" said the Countess,  with emotion; and she bent a look of love and gentle pride upon her  girl: a heavenly look, such as, they say, is given to the eye of the  short-lived resting on the short-lived.    The Countess resumed: \"My old friend request me to be serviceable to  you. It is the first favour she has done us the honour of asking us, and  the request is sacred. You are in holy orders, sir?\"    Gerard bowed.    \"I fear you are not a priest, you look too young.\"    \"Oh no, madam; I am not even a sub-deacon. I am only a lector; but next  month I shall be an exorcist, and before long an acolyth.\"    \"Well, Monsieur Gerard, with your accomplishments you can soon pass  through the inferior orders. And let me beg you to do so. For the  day after you have said your first mass I shall have the pleasure of  appointing you to a benefice.\"    \"Oh, madam!\"    \"And, Marie, remember I make this promise in your name as well as my  own.\"    \"Fear not, mamma: I will not forget. But if he will take my advice,  what he will be is Bishop of Liege. The Bishop of Liege is a beautiful  bishop. What! do you not remember him, mamma, that day we were at Liege?  he was braver than grandpapa himself. He had on a crown, a high one, and  it was cut in the middle, and it was full of oh! such beautiful jewels;  and his gown stiff with gold; and his mantle, too; and it had a broad  border, all pictures; but, above all, his gloves; you have no such  gloves, mamma. They were embroidered and covered with jewels, and  scented with such lovely scent; I smelt them all the time he was giving  me his blessing on my head with them. Dear old man! I dare say he will  die soon most old people do and then, sir, you Can be bishop you know,  and wear--    \"Gently, Marie, gently: bishoprics are for old gentlemen; and this is a  young gentleman.\"    \"Mamma! he is not so very young.    \"Not compared with you, Marie, eh?\"    \"He is a good birth dear mamma; and I am sure he is good enough for a  bishop.    \"Alas! mademoiselle, you are mistaken\"    \"I know not that, Monsieur Gerard; but I am a little puzzled to know on  what grounds mademoiselle there pronounces your character so boldly.\"    \"Alas! mamma,\" said the Princess, \"you have not looked at his face,  then;\" and she raised her eyebrows at her mother's simplicity.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said the Countess, \"I have. Well, sir, if I cannot  go quite so fast as my daughter, attribute it to my age, not to a want  of interest in your welfare. A benefice will do to begin your Career  with; and I must take care it is not too far from--what call you the  place?\"    \"Tergou, madam    \"A priest gives up much,\" continued the Countess; \"often, I fear, he  learns too late how much;\" and her woman's eye rested a moment on Gerard  with mild pity and half surprise at his resigning her sex and all the  heaven they can bestow, and the great parental joys: \"at least you shall  be near your friends. Have you a mother?\"    \"Yes, madam, thanks be to God!\"    \"Good! You shall have a church near Tergou. She will thank me. And now,  sir, we must not detain you too long from those who have a better claim  on your society than we have. Duchess, oblige me by bidding one of the  pages conduct him to the hall of banquet; the way is hard to find.\"    Gerard bowed low to the Countess and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#7)"],[1,"direction, which I knew they had no chance of  holding. Of course I could have no headlights, and the ditches were many,  but in some miraculous way, more through good luck than good management, I  did find corps headquarters, and what was better still, the general's  reprimand took the form of bread and ham and a stiff peg of whiskey--the  first food I had had since before daylight.    During the night the Turks evacuated the town. Their forces were certainly  mobile. They could cover the most surprising distances, and live on almost  nothing. We marched in and occupied. White flags were flying from all the  houses, which were not nearly so much damaged from the bombardment as one  would have supposed. This was invariably the case; indeed, it is  surprising to see how much shelling a town can undergo without noticeable  effect. It takes a long time to level a town in the way it has been done  in northern France. In this region the banks of the river average about  one hundred and fifty feet in height, and Tekrit is built at the junction  of two ravines. No two streets are on the same level; sometimes the roofs  of the houses on a lower level serve as the streets for the houses above.  Many of the booths in the bazaar were open and transacting business when  we arrived, an excellent proof of how firmly the Arabs believed in British  fair dealing. Our men bought cigarettes, matches, and vegetables. Yusuf  had lived here three or four years, so I despatched him to get chickens  and eggs for the mess. I ran into Marshall, who was on his way to dine  with the mayor, who had turned out to be an old friend of his. He asked me  to join him, and we climbed up to a very comfortable house, built around a  large courtyard. It was the best meal we had either of us had in  days--great pilaus of rice, excellent chicken, and fresh unleavened bread.  This bread looks like a very large and thin griddle-cake. The Arab uses it  as a plate. Eating with your hands is at first rather difficult. Before  falling to, a ewer is brought around to you, and you are supplied with  soap--a servant pours water from the ewer over your hands, and then gives  you a towel. After eating, the same process is gone through with. There  are certain formalities that must be regarded--one of them being that you  must not eat or drink with your left hand.    In Tekrit we did not find as much in the way of supplies and ammunition as  we had hoped. The Turk had destroyed the greater part of his store. We did  find great quantities of wood, and in that barren, treeless country it was  worth a lot. Most of the inhabitants of Tekrit are raftsmen by profession.  Their rafts have been made in the same manner since before the days of  Xerxes and Darius. Inflated goatskins are used as a basis for a platform  of poles, cut in the up-stream forests. On these, starting from Diarbekr  or Mosul, they float down all their goods. When they reach Tekrit they  leave the poles there, and start up-stream on foot, carrying their  deflated goatskins. The Turks used this method a great deal bringing down  their supplies. In pre-war days the rafts, keleks as they are called,  would often come straight through to Baghdad, but many were always broken  up at Tekrit, for there is a desert route running across to Hit on the  Euphrates, and the supplies from up-river were taken across this in camel  caravans.    The aerodrome lay six or seven miles above the town, and I was anxious to  see it and the comfortable billets the Germans had built themselves. I  found a friend whose duties required motor transportation, and we set off  in his car. A dust-storm was raging, and we had some difficulty in finding  our way through the network of trenches. Once outside, the storm became  worse, and we could only see a few yards in front of us. We got completely  lost, and after nearly running over the edge of the bluff, gave up the  attempt, and slowly worked our way back.    When we started off on the advance I was reading Xenophon's _Anabasis_. On  the day when we were ordered to march on Tekrit a captain of the Royal  Flying Corps, an ex-master at Eton, was in the mess, and when I told him  that I was nearly out of reading matter, he said that next time he came  over he would drop me Plutarch's _Lives_. I asked him to drop it at corps  headquarters, and that a friend of mine there would see that I got it. The  next day in the heat of the fighting a plane came over low, signalling  that it was dropping a message. As the streamer fell close by, there was a  rush to pick it up and learn how the attack was progressing. Fortunately,  I was far away when the packet was opened and found to contain the book  that the pilot had promised to drop for me.    After we had been occupying the town for a few days, orders came through  to prepare to fall back on Samarra. The line of communication was so long  that it was impossible to maintain us, except at too great a cost to the  transportation facilities possessed by the Expeditionary Forces. Eight or  ten months later, when we had more rails in hand, a line was laid to  Tekrit, which had been abandoned by the Turks under the threat of our  advance to Kirkuk, in the Persian hills. It was difficult to explain to  the men, particularly to the Indians, the necessity for falling back. All  they could understand was that we had taken the town at no small cost, and  now we were about to give it up.    For several days I was busy helping to prepare rafts to take down the  timber and such other captured supplies as were worth removing. The river  was low, leaving a broad stretch of beach below the town, and to this we  brought down the poles. Several camels had died near the water, probably  from the results of our shelling, and the hot weather soon made them very  unpleasant companions. The first day was bad enough; the second was worse.  The natives were not in the least affected. They brought their washing and  worked among them--they came down and drew their drinking-water from the  river, either beside the camels or down-stream of them, with complete  indifference. It is true this water percolates drop by drop through large,  porous clay pots before it is drunk, but even so, it would have seemed  that they would have preferred its coming from up-stream of the derelict  \"ships of the desert.\" On the third day, to their mild surprise, we  managed with infinite difficulty to tow the camels out through the shallow  water into the main stream.    We finally got our rafts built, over eighty in number, and arranged for  enough Arab pilots to take care of half of them. On the remainder we put  Indian sepoys. They made quite a fleet when we finally got them all  started down-stream. Two were broken up in the rapids near Daur, the rest  reached Samarra in safety on the second day.    We had a pleasant camp on the bluffs below Tekrit--high-enough above the  plain to be free of the ordinary dust-storms, and the prospect of  returning to Samarra was scarcely more pleasant to us than to the men.  Five days after we had taken the town, we turned our backs on it and  marched slowly back to rail-head.          III    PATROLLING THE RUINS OF BABYLON      We returned to find Samarra buried in dust and more desolate than ever. A  few days later came the first rain-storm. After a night's downpour the air  was radiantly clear, and it was joy to ride off on the rounds, no longer  like Zeus, enveloped in a cloud.    It was a relief to see the heat-stroke camps broken up. During the summer  months our ranks were fearfully thinned through the sun. Although it was  the British troops that suffered most, the Indians were by no means  immune. Before the camps were properly organized the percentage of  mortality was exceedingly large, for the only effective treatment  necessitates the use of much ice. The patient runs a temperature which it  was impossible to control until the ice-making machines were installed.  The camps were situated in the coolest and most comfortable places, but in  spite of everything, death was a frequent result, and recoveries were apt  to be only partial. Men who had had a bad stroke were rarely of any  further use in the country.    Another sickness of the hot season which now began to claim less victims  was sand-fly fever. This fever, which, as its name indicates, was  contracted from the bites of sand-flies, varied widely in virulence.  Sometimes it was so severe that the victim had to be evacuated to India;  as a rule he went no farther than a base hospital at Baghdad or Amara.    One of the things about which the Tommy felt most keenly in the  Mesopotamian campaign was that there was no such thing as a \"Cushy  Blighty.\" To take you to \"Blighty\" a wound must mean permanent  disablement, otherwise you either convalesced in the country or, at best,  were sent to India. In the same manner there were no short leaves, for  there was nowhere to go. At the most rapid rate of travelling it took two  weeks to get to India, and once there, although the people did everything  possible in the way of entertaining, the enlisted man found little to make  him less homesick than he had been in Mesopotamia. Transportation was so  difficult and the trip so long that only under very exceptional  circumstances was leave to England given. One spring it was announced  that officers wishing to get either married or divorced could apply for  leave with good hopes of success. Many applied, but a number returned  without having fulfilled either condition, so that the following year no  leaves were given upon those grounds. The army commander put all divorce  cases into the hands of an officer whose civil occupation had been the  law, and who arranged them without the necessity of granting home leave.    A week after our return to Samarra a rumor started that General Maude was  down with cholera. For some time past there had been sporadic cases,  though not enough to be counted"]]]
