Answer them, or go to prison.    ABBOT. I pray you for some time to think!    KING. I will give you just two weeks. If you cannot answer then, I'll  have your head cut off.

We do nothing there but laugh since your visit to us, sir. We  laugh all day and half the night.    ABBOT. Now why do you do that?    SHEPHERD. Because, sir, I look so much like you. At least, they think so  in our village.    ABBOT. Why, that is true, you do. Well, what can I do for you?    SHEPHERD. I have heard about the two questions, sir. I have come to help  you.    ABBOT. How can you help me? Speak!    SHEPHERD. I will go to the king in your place. He will think that I am  you.    ABBOT. Can you answer the two questions?    SHEPHERD. Only the king himself can say. Now give me your gown and cap  and golden staff, dear Abbot.    ABBOT. Well, I will let you try.

There was a large and orderly crowd  who appeared thoroughly to enjoy themselves, and their outing in that  fine and sunny climate. The Racecourse seemed a good one, though rather  hard owing to the dry weather. It is in a very pretty spot with  picturesque surroundings.    The Kafirs, who are employed in great numbers, and who are earning high  wages at their various occupations, are always to be seen, either  working hard, or, after the hours of labour are over, amusing  themselves cheerfully, chatting at street corners, walking, gossiping,  and talking, and gratifying themselves by giving vent to their very  voluble tongues. Here also, as at Johannesburg, at Potchefstroom, and at  Klerksdorp, I was forcibly struck with the large amount of English  spoken, as well as of the number of English names over the various shops  in the Transvaal towns. This is an interesting and important fact, which  marks the tendency of the direction of future development. The country  must certainly become more and more anglicised, in spite of the  political efforts made to oppose it.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    WATERBURG.      I left Pretoria on July the 17th in a wagon with eight horses,  accompanied by two friends, for an excursion into the Waterburg district  of the Transvaal. On this occasion we travelled about one hundred and  fifty miles north of Pretoria in the course of a fortnight, returning  about the same distance back again. We had a half-breed servant named  Sole with us, who made himself generally useful during our journey. All  this time we camped out day and night, sleeping always in the open  veldt, in true gipsy fashion.    We went by the Van der Vroom Poort, having the Maalieburg range of  mountains on our left.    Our first night was spent at a farm called \"Polonia,\" belonging to a  Russian Missionary who has been for many years in the Transvaal. He  unites the pursuits of spiritual instruction according to the tenets of  the Greek Church, with farming on a large scale. On leaving \"Polonia\" we  passed the large and picturesque German Mission Station of \"Hebron,\"  which is situated in the midst of a rich and fertile valley. One night  we outspanned at a spot called the \"Salt Pans.\" While breakfast was  being prepared the next morning, I walked to see those wonderful \"Salt  Pans,\" which were close to our camping ground. I descended by a steep  path some six hundred or seven hundred feet to the bottom. It is an  immense amphitheatre at the base of thickly wooded hills. It is larger  in extent than the vast open excavation formed by the \"Kimberley\" Mine  at Kimberley. The salt and soda brine is perpetually oosing from the  bottom, and is continually being scraped up with a sort of wooden  scraper into heaps, where, after a time, by the action of the  atmosphere, it becomes crystallised. I picked up and brought away with  me several crystals of pure salt. This is another of the marvels of the  Transvaal, a country which abounds in natural wealth of all kinds,  fitted for the service of man. These Salt Pans are the property of the  Transvaal Government, which derives a considerable income from the tax  imposed for taking away the salt, and soda, from them.    Frequently during our journey we outspanned just outside the Kafir  kraals, and often entered into them; one of my companions speaking the  native, as well as the Dutch languages very fluently. We were always  received by both Boers, and Kafirs, very kindly. Sometimes we were  accompanied by a large number of Kafirs for days. I remember once,  counting as many as forty Kafirs sitting round our camp fire, clothed  and unclothed, and in every variety of costume, from the old British  Artillery tunic to the equally ancient pea coat, the bright-coloured  blue morning jacket, and the cloak of Jackall skins. On this occasion  they remained all night with us, keeping up the fire and indulging in  endless and cheerful talk among themselves. When I wrapped myself in my  kaross and turned into the wagon at night I left them talking. When I  awoke in the early morning I found them talking still.    The country I saw in the Northern part of the Transvaal is very  different, and far more picturesque than it is in the South-West or  South-East, which have a close resemblance to one another, in their  bare, barren, treeless, and dreary character. I saw some parts which  were really beautiful. One day we drove for several miles through quite  lovely scenery. In passing along the road I was forcibly reminded of the  road between Braemar and Mar Lodge, in Aberdeenshire, which it strongly  resembles. The road runs on the side of the hill, sloping down to the  rivulet at the bottom, exactly like the river Dee, and the Rooiburg, or  red tinted, Mountain, exactly resembles the heather on the Scottish  hills. It is altogether a charming spot, and a perfect picture of fine  scenery. There is a large quantity of excellent and valuable timber in  this district, as well as abundant evidence of mineral-bearing quartz. I  believe that, some day, other Johannesburgs are destined to rise in the  Northern part of the Transvaal, rivalling, or perhaps even eclipsing,  the treasures already discovered in the Randt.    At the spot I have described, which is called Hartebeestepoort, not far  from the banks of the Zand River, where there is a good quantity of  excellent and valuable timber, there was quite a romantic scene one  night. We were discussing, as usual, our evening meal round our camp  fire. It was starlight, but otherwise we were in total darkness. In  addition to ourselves, there were nine Kafirs, making a party of a dozen  altogether. It was an intensely interesting and remarkable scene to me,  to find myself surrounded by these wild fellows in perfectly friendly  fashion, in the midst of the vast veldt, the silence and stillness only  broken every now and then by the cry of the jackals howling in the  distance. On leaving here we travelled north towards Grouthoek, which  is situated in the midst of the Rhynoster range of mountains, being  drawn by oxen, our horses following us, in order to give them rest, and  so keep them fresher.    I was disappointed at the small quantity of game we found on our  journey. We occasionally shot a springbok, and I thus had an opportunity  of making myself acquainted with the delicious flavour of the South  African venison. But the days of the enormous herds which once abounded  in these regions are gone. They have been either exterminated by the  Boers, or been driven far northward, into the interior of Africa,  together with the lions and elephants, over whose former habitation I  was travelling. There are still a good many koodoos, and hartebeestes in  this neighbourhood, but I was not fortunate enough to come across them.  Our commissariat was occasionally supplemented by a delicious bird,  about the size of a pheasant, called the kooran, as well as by a few  pheasants, partridges, and guinea fowls.    One afternoon we were exposed to a thrilling adventure, which, but for  the merciful interposition of Providence, might have terminated in a  most disastrous way. Suddenly, as we were driving along the road,  through a dense wood, we discovered to the right of us the light of an  immense bush fire. It was careering wildly along, fiercely burning, and  sweeping everything before it. We saw it was coming swiftly towards the  road we were travelling. We pulled up the horses, and taking out lucifer  matches, jumped off the wagon, and tried to set alight to the grass,  which was about five or six feet high, and very dry, close by us, in  order to secure a clear open space around us. But it was too late. The  fierce fire, to the height of several feet, was rushing and crashing  through the wood furiously towards us. Another moment, and we should  have been within its terrible grasp, and wagon, horses, and ourselves  infallibly burnt. It was in truth an awful crisis. We jumped back into  the wagon and pushed frantically forward. Showers of sparks were already  in the road. But, fortunately, the fire, which for a full half mile was  burning behind us, was only a short distance in front of us, and, thank  God, we happily escaped.    One of the great advantages I have derived from my tour is, that I have  had many opportunities of communicating personally with so many men of  different races, and all classes--British, Dutch, and natives.    During my present journey I had a most interesting conversation one  morning with a transport driver, who was travelling by the northern  part of the Transvaal, with three hundred lean cattle from the Cape  Colony into Bechuanaland. He gave me some very valuable and important  information with regard to Colonial feeling in the country districts of  the Cape Colony. He was Colonial born, and a fine, handsome man of about  forty--a descendant of the Scotch farmers, who emigrated to the Cape in  1820. His conversation impressed me much. He told me that the Colonists  generally are loyal to the Queen to the backbone; but not to the British  Government, which they consider has not represented their feelings and  opinions, and has sacrificed their interests. They dislike the Colonial  Government, and are not favourable to responsible Government, as they  see it.    They would prefer being under the British Government direct, in spite of  all its terrible mistakes and mishaps, from which they have so cruelly  suffered. My informant's opinion was, that the present policy of the  administration in Bechuanaland is not conducive to encourage emigration,  as it puts artificial impediments in the way of farmers with small means  settling there, which, he thought, they would do in crowds from the  Colony, if they were allowed to do so on paying a quit rent, say of L10  or L15 per annum, instead of the high terms of L40 demanded at present.
