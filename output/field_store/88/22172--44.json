HYMN BEFORE SLEEP        Draw near, Almighty Father,      Ne'er seen by mortal eye;    Come, O Thou Word eternal,      O Spirit blest, be nigh.      One light of threefold Godhead,      One power that all transcends;    God is of God begotten,      And God from both descends.      The hour of rest approaches,      The toils of day are past,    And o'er our tired bodies      Sleep's gentle charm is cast.      The mind, by cares tormented      Amid life's storm and stress,    Drinks deep the wondrous potion      That brings forgetfulness.      O'er weary, toil-worn mortals      The spells of Lethe steal;    Sad hearts lose all their sorrow,      Nor pain nor anguish feel.      For to His frail creation      God gave this law to keep,    That labour should be lightened      By soft and healing sleep.      But while sweet languor wanders      Through all the pulsing veins,    And, wrapt in dewy slumber,      The heart at rest remains,      The soul, in wakeful vigour,      Aloft in freedom flies,    And sees in many a semblance      The hidden mysteries.      For, freed from care, the spirit      That came from out the sky,    Born of the stainless aether,      Can never idle lie.      A thousand changing phantoms      She fashions through the night,    And 'midst a world of fancy      Pursues her rapid flight.      But divers are the visions      That night to dreamers shows;    Rare gleams of straying splendour      The future may disclose;      More oft the truth is darkened,      And lying fantasy    Deceives the affrighted sleeper      With cunning treachery.      To him whose life is holy      The things that are concealed    Lie open to his spirit      In radiant light revealed;      But he whose heart is blackened,      With many a sin imbued,    Sees phantoms grim and ghastly      That beckon and delude.      So in the Egyptian dungeon      The patriarch of old    Unto the king's two servants      Their fateful visions told:      And one is brought from prison      The monarch's wine to pour,    One, on the gibbet hanging,      Foul birds of prey devour,      He warned the king, distracted      By riddles of the night,    To hoard the plenteous harvests      Against the years of blight.      Soon, lord of half a kingdom,      A mighty potentate,    He shares the royal sceptre      And dwells in princely state.      But ah! how deep the secrets      The holy sleeper sees    To whom Christ shows His highest,      Most sacred mysteries.      For God's most faithful servant      The clouds were rolled away,    And John beheld the wonders      That sealed from mortals lay.      The Lamb of God, encrimsoned      With sacrificial stains,    Alone the Book can open      That destiny contains.      By His strong hand is wielded      A keen, two-edged brand    That, flashing like the lightning,      Smites swift on either hand.      Before His bar of judgment      Both soul and body lie;    He whom that dread sword smiteth      The second death shall die.      Yet mercy tempers justice,      And few the Avenger sends    (Whose guilt is past all pardon)      To death that never ends.      To Him the Father yieldeth      The judgment-seat of Heaven;    To Him a Name excelling      All other names is given.      For by His strength transcendent      Shall Antichrist be slain,    And from that raging monster      Fair trophies shall He gain:      That all-devouring Dragon,      With blood of martyrs red,    On whose abhorred power      John's solemn curse is laid.      And thus the proud usurper      Of His high name is cast    By Him, the true Christ, vanquished      To deepest hell at last.      Upon the saint heroic      Such wondrous slumber falls    That, in the spirit roaming,      He treads heaven's highest halls.      We may not, in our weakness,      To dreams like these aspire,    Whose souls are steeped in error      And evil things desire.      Enough, if weary bodies      In peaceful sleep may rest;    Enough, if no dark powers      Our slumbering souls molest.      Christian! the font remember,      The sacramental vow,    The holy water sprinkled,      The oil that marked thy brow!      When at sleep's call thou seekest      To rest in slumber chaste,    Let first the sacred emblem      On breast and brow be traced.      The Cross dispels all darkness,      All sin before it flies,    And by that sign protected      The mind all fear defies.      Avaunt! ye fleeting phantoms      That mock our midnight hours;    Avaunt! thou great Deceiver      With all thy guileful powers.      Thou Serpent, old and crafty,      Who by a thousand arts    And manifold temptations      Dost vex our sleeping hearts,      Vanish! for Christ is with us;      Away! 'tis Christ the Lord:    The sign thou must acknowledge      Condemns thy hellish horde.      And, though the weary body      Relaxed in sleep may be,    Our hearts, Lord, e'en in slumber,      Shall meditate on Thee.                                VII.

As I have  already stated in different places, the symptoms are the sexual  activities of the patient. The proof for this assertion I have obtained  from the psychoanalysis of hysterics and other neurotics during a period  of twenty years, the results of which I hope to give later in a detailed  account.    Psychoanalysis removes the symptoms of hysteria on the supposition that  they are the substitutes--the transcriptions as it were--for a series of  emotionally accentuated psychic processes, wishes, and desires, to which  a passage for their discharge through the conscious psychic activities  has been cut off by a special process (repression). These thought  formations which are restrained in the state of the unconscious strive  for expression, that is, for _discharge_, in conformity to their  affective value, and find such in hysteria through a process of  _conversion_ into somatic phenomena--the hysterical symptoms. If, _lege  artis_, and with the aid of a special technique, retrogressive  transformations of the symptoms into the affectful and conscious  thoughts can be effected, it then becomes possible to get the most  accurate information about the nature and origin of these previously  unconscious psychic formations.    *Results of Psychoanalysis.*--In this manner it has been discovered that  the symptoms represent the equivalent for the strivings which received  their strength from the source of the sexual impulse. This fully concurs  with what we know of the character of hysterics, which we have taken as  models for all psycho-neurotics, before they have become diseased, and  with what we know concerning the causes of the disease. The hysterical  character evinces a part of sexual repression which reaches beyond the  normal limits, an exaggeration of the resistances against the sexual  impulse which we know as shame and loathing. It is an instinctive flight  from intellectual occupation with the sexual problem, the consequence of  which in pronounced cases is a complete sexual ignorance, which is  preserved till the age of sexual maturity is attained.[24]    This feature, so characteristic of hysteria, is not seldom concealed in  crude observation by the existence of the second constitutional factor  of hysteria, namely, the enormous development of the sexual craving. But  the psychological analysis will always reveal it and solves the very  contradictory enigma of hysteria by proving the existence of the  contrasting pair, an immense sexual desire and a very exaggerated sexual  rejection.    The provocation of the disease in hysterically predisposed persons is  brought about if in consequence of their progressive maturity or  external conditions of life they are earnestly confronted with the real  sexual demand. Between the pressure of the craving and the opposition of  the sexual rejection an outlet for the disease results, which does not  remove the conflict but seeks to elude it by transforming the libidinous  strivings into symptoms. It is an exception only in appearance if a  hysterical person, say a man, becomes subject to some banal emotional  disturbance, to a conflict in the center of which there is no sexual  interest. Psychoanalysis will regularly show that it is the sexual  components of the conflict which make the disease possible by  withdrawing the psychic processes from normal adjustment.    *Neurosis and Perversion.*--A great part of the opposition to my  assertion is explained by the fact that the sexuality from which I  deduce the psychoneurotic symptoms is thought of as coincident with the  normal sexual impulse. But psychoanalysis teaches us better than this.  It shows that the symptoms do not by any means result at the expense  only of the so called normal sexual impulse (at least not exclusively or  preponderately), but they represent the converted expression of impulses  which in a broader sense might be designated as _perverse_ if they could  manifest themselves directly in phantasies and acts without deviating  from consciousness. The symptoms are therefore partially formed at the  cost of abnormal sexuality. _The neurosis is, so to say, the negative of  the perversion._[25]    The sexual impulse of the psychoneurotic shows all the aberrations which  we have studied as variations of the normal and as manifestations of  morbid sexual life.    (_a_) In all the neurotics without exception we find feelings of inversion  in the unconscious psychic life, fixation of libido on persons of the  same sex. It is impossible, without a deep and searching discussion,  adequately to appreciate the significance of this factor for the  formation of the picture of the disease; I can only assert that the  unconscious propensity to inversion is never wanting and is particularly  of immense service in explaining male hysteria.[26]    (_b_) All the inclinations to anatomical transgression can be demonstrated  in psychoneurotics in the unconscious and as symptom-creators. Of  special frequency and intensity are those which impart to the mouth and  the mucous membrane of the anus the role of genitals.    (_c_) The partial desires which usually appear in contrasting pairs play  a very prominent role among the symptom-creators in the psychoneuroses.  We have learned to know them as carriers of new sexual aims, such as  peeping mania, exhibitionism, and the actively and passively formed  impulses of cruelty. The contribution of the last is indispensable for  the understanding of the morbid nature of the symptoms; it almost  regularly controls some portion of the social behavior of the patient.  The transformation of love into hatred, of tenderness into hostility,  which is characteristic of a large number of neurotic cases and  apparently of all cases of paranoia, takes place by means of the union  of cruelty with the libido.    The interest in these deductions will be more heightened by certain  peculiarities of the diagnosis of facts.    Alpha. There is nothing in the unconscious streams of thought of  the neuroses which would correspond to an inclination towards fetichism;  a circumstance which throws light on the psychological peculiarity of  this well understood perversion.    Beta. Wherever any such impulse is found in the unconscious which  can be paired with a contrasting one, it can regularly be demonstrated  that the latter, too, is effective. Every active perversion is here  accompanied by its passive counterpart. He who in the unconscious is an  exhibitionist is at the same time a voyeur, he who suffers from sadistic  feelings as a result of repression will also show another reinforcement  of the symptoms from the source of masochistic tendencies. The perfect  concurrence with the behavior of the corresponding positive perversions  is certainly very noteworthy. In the picture of the disease, however,  the preponderant role is played by either one or the other of the  opposing tendencies.    Gamma. In a pronounced case of psychoneurosis we seldom find the  development of one single perverted impulse; usually there are many and  regularly there are traces of all perversions. The individual impulse,  however, on account of its intensity, is independent of the development  of the others, but the study of the positive perversions gives us the  accurate counterpart to it.      PARTIAL IMPULSES AND EROGENOUS ZONES    Keeping in mind what we have learned from the examination of the  positive and negative perversions, it becomes quite obvious that they  can be referred to a number of \"partial impulses,\" which are not,  however, primary but are subject to further analysis. By an \"impulse\" we  can understand in the first place nothing but the psychic representative  of a continually flowing internal somatic source of excitement, in  contradistinction to the \"stimulus\" which is produced by isolated  excitements coming from without. The impulse is thus one of the concepts  marking the limits between the psychic and the physical. The simplest  and most obvious assumption concerning the nature of the impulses would  be that in themselves they possess no quality but are only taken into  account as a measure of the demand for effort in the psychic life. What  distinguishes the impulses from one another and furnishes them with  specific attributes is their relation to their somatic _sources_ and to  their _aims_. The source of the impulse is an exciting process in an  organ, and the immediate aim of the impulse lies in the elimination of  this organic stimulus.    Another preliminary assumption in the theory of the impulse which we  cannot relinquish, states that the bodily organs furnish two kinds of  excitements which are determined by differences of a chemical nature.  One of these forms of excitement we designate as the specifically sexual  and the concerned organ as the _erogenous zone_, while the sexual  element emanating from it is the partial impulse.[27]    In the perversions which claim sexual significance for the oral cavity  and the anal opening the part played by the erogenous zone is quite  obvious. It behaves in every way like a part of the sexual apparatus. In  hysteria these parts of the body, as well as the tracts of mucous  membrane proceeding from them, become the seat of new sensations and  innervating changes in a manner similar to the real genitals when under  the excitement of normal sexual processes.    The significance of the erogenous zones in the psychoneuroses, as  additional apparatus and substitutes for the genitals, appears to be  most prominent in hysteria though that does not signify that it is of  lesser validity in the other morbid forms. It is not so recognizable in  compulsion neurosis and paranoia because here the symptom formation  takes place in regions of the psychic apparatus which lie at a great  distance from the"]]]
