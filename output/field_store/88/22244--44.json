[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#7)"],[1," thrown; I heard the  sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body.  The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts  broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem  to stern, overthrowing men, and breaking the lashings of the spars.  A  fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time  to stop myself, I fell into the sea.        CHAPTER VII    AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF WHALE    This unexpected fall so stunned me that I have no clear recollection of  my sensations at the time.  I was at first drawn down to a depth of  about twenty feet.  I am a good swimmer (though without pretending to  rival Byron or Edgar Poe, who were masters of the art), and in that  plunge I did not lose my presence of mind.  Two vigorous strokes  brought me to the surface of the water.  My first care was to look for  the frigate.  Had the crew seen me disappear?  Had the Abraham Lincoln  veered round?  Would the captain put out a boat?  Might I hope to be  saved?    The darkness was intense.  I caught a glimpse of a black mass  disappearing in the east, its beacon lights dying out in the distance.  It was the frigate!  I was lost.    \"Help, help!\"  I shouted, swimming towards the Abraham Lincoln in  desperation.    My clothes encumbered me; they seemed glued to my body, and paralysed  my movements.    I was sinking!  I was suffocating!    \"Help!\"    This was my last cry.  My mouth filled with water; I struggled against  being drawn down the abyss.  Suddenly my clothes were seized by a  strong hand, and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the  sea; and I heard, yes, I heard these words pronounced in my ear:    \"If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder, master would  swim with much greater ease.\"    I seized with one hand my faithful Conseil's arm.    \"Is it you?\" said I, \"you?\"    \"Myself,\" answered Conseil; \"and waiting master's orders.\"    \"That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?\"    \"No; but, being in my master's service, I followed him.\"    The worthy fellow thought that was but natural.    \"And the frigate?\"  I asked.    \"The frigate?\" replied Conseil, turning on his back; \"I think that  master had better not count too much on her.\"    \"You think so?\"    \"I say that, at the time I threw myself into the sea, I heard the men  at the wheel say, `The screw and the rudder are broken.'    \"Broken?\"    \"Yes, broken by the monster's teeth.  It is the only injury the Abraham  Lincoln has sustained.  But it is a bad look-out for us--she no longer  answers her helm.\"    \"Then we are lost!\"    \"Perhaps so,\" calmly answered Conseil.  \"However, we have still several  hours before us, and one can do a good deal in some hours.\"    Conseil's imperturbable coolness set me up again.  I swam more  vigorously; but, cramped by my clothes, which stuck to me like a leaden  weight, I felt great difficulty in bearing up.  Conseil saw this.    \"Will master let me make a slit?\" said he; and, slipping an open knife  under my clothes, he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly.  Then he cleverly slipped them off me, while I swam for both of us.    Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each  other.    Nevertheless, our situation was no less terrible.  Perhaps our  disappearance had not been noticed; and, if it had been, the frigate  could not tack, being without its helm.  Conseil argued on this  supposition, and laid his plans accordingly.  This quiet boy was  perfectly self-possessed. We then decided that, as our only chance of  safety was being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln's boats, we ought to  manage so as to wait for them as long as possible.  I resolved then to  husband our strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the same  time; and this is how we managed:  while one of us lay on our back,  quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would  swim and push the other on in front.  This towing business did not last  more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus, we could  swim on for some hours, perhaps till day-break. Poor chance! but hope  is so firmly rooted in the heart of man!  Moreover, there were two of  us.  Indeed I declare (though it may seem improbable) if I sought to  destroy all hope--if I wished to despair, I could not.    The collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about  eleven o'clock in the evening before.  I reckoned then we should have  eight hours to swim before sunrise, an operation quite practicable if  we relieved each other.  The sea, very calm, was in our favour.  Sometimes I tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only  dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by our movements.  I watched  the luminous waves that broke over my hand, whose mirror-like surface  was spotted with silvery rings.  One might have said that we were in a  bath of quicksilver.    Near one o'clock in the morning, I was seized with dreadful fatigue.  My limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp.  Conseil was  obliged to keep me up, and our preservation devolved on him alone.  I  heard the poor boy pant; his breathing became short and hurried.  I  found that he could not keep up much longer.    \"Leave me! leave me!\"  I said to him.    \"Leave my master?  Never!\" replied he.  \"I would drown first.\"    Just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that  the wind was driving to the east.  The surface of the sea glittered  with its rays.  This kindly light reanimated us.  My head got better  again.  I looked at all points of the horizon.  I saw the frigate!  She  was five miles from us, and looked like a dark mass, hardly  discernible.  But no boats!    I would have cried out.  But what good would it have been at such a  distance!  My swollen lips could utter no sounds.  Conseil could  articulate some words, and I heard him repeat at intervals, \"Help!  help!\"    Our movements were suspended for an instant; we listened.  It might be  only a singing in the ear, but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the  cry from Conseil.    \"Did you hear?\"  I murmured.    \"Yes!  Yes!\"    And Conseil gave one more despairing cry.    This time there was no mistake!  A human voice responded to ours!  Was  it the voice of another unfortunate creature, abandoned in the middle  of the ocean, some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel?  Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the  darkness?    Conseil made a last effort, and, leaning on my shoulder, while I struck  out in a desperate effort, he raised himself half out of the water,  then fell back exhausted.    \"What did you see?\"    \"I saw----\" murmured he; \"I saw--but do not talk--reserve all your  strength!\"    What had he seen?  Then, I know not why, the thought of the monster  came into my head for the first time!  But that voice!  The time is  past for Jonahs to take refuge in whales' bellies!  However, Conseil  was towing me again.  He raised his head sometimes, looked before us,  and uttered a cry of recognition, which was responded to by a voice  that came nearer and nearer.  I scarcely heard it.  My strength was  exhausted; my fingers stiffened; my hand afforded me support no longer;  my mouth, convulsively opening, filled with salt water.  Cold crept  over me.  I raised my head for the last time, then I sank.    At this moment a hard body struck me.  I clung to it: then I felt that  I was being drawn up, that I was brought to the surface of the water,  that my chest collapsed--I fainted.    It is certain that I soon came to, thanks to the vigorous rubbings that  I received.  I half opened my eyes.    \"Conseil!\"  I murmured.    \"Does master call me?\" asked Conseil.    Just then, by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to  the horizon, I saw a face which was not Conseil's and which I  immediately recognised.    \"Ned!\"  I cried.    \"The same, sir, who is seeking his prize!\" replied the Canadian.    \"Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?\"    \"Yes, Professor; but more fortunate than you, I was able to find a  footing almost directly upon a floating island.\"    \"An island?\"    \"Or, more correctly speaking, on our gigantic narwhal.\"    \"Explain yourself, Ned!\"    \"Only I soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was  blunted.\"    \"Why, Ned, why?\"    \"Because, Professor, that beast is made of sheet iron.\"    The Canadian's last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain.  I  wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being, or object, half out of  the water, which served us for a refuge.  I kicked it.  It was  evidently a hard, impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that  forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia.  But this hard body  might be a bony covering, like that of the antediluvian animals; and I  should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles, such as  tortoises or alligators.    Well, no! the blackish back that supported me was smooth, polished,  without scales.  The blow produced a metallic sound; and, incredible  though it may be, it seemed, I might say, as if it was made of riveted  plates.    There was no doubt about it!  This monster, this natural phenomenon  that had puzzled the learned world, and over thrown and misled the  imagination of seamen of both hemispheres, it must be owned was a still  more astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch as it was a simply human  construction.    We had no time to lose, however.  We were lying upon the back of a sort  of submarine boat, which appeared (as far as I could judge) like a huge  fish of steel.  Ned Land's mind was made up on this point.  Conseil and  I could only agree with him.    Just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing (which was  evidently propelled by a screw), and it began to move.  We had only  just time to seize hold of the upper part, which rose about seven feet  out of the water, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#7)"],[1,"epithelium that lines the mid-gut  of the imago. The larval cells are shed into the cavity of the stomach  and become completely broken down. J. Anglas (1902), describing these  microscopic changes in the transformations of wasps and bees, has shown  that the tiny replacing cells can be recognised in sections through the  digestive canal of a very young larva; they may be regarded as  representing imaginal buds of the adult gastric epithelium. In the  transformations of two-winged flies of the bluebottle group, A.  Kowalevsky (1887) has shown that these replacing cells are aggregated in  little masses scattered at different points along the stomach and thus  corresponding rather closely to the imaginal discs of the legs and  wings.    The gullet, crop, and gizzard of an insect, which lie in front of the  stomach, are lined by cells derived from the outer skin (ectoderm) which  is pushed in to form what is called the 'fore-gut.' Similarly the  intestine and rectum, behind the stomach, are lined with ectodermal  cells which arise from the inpushed 'hind-gut.' The larval fore- and  hind-guts are broken down at the end of larval life and their lining is  replaced by fresh tissue derived from two imaginal bands which surround  the cavity of the digestive tube, one at the hinder end of the fore-gut,  and the other at the front end of the hind-gut. The larval salivary  glands in connection with the gullet are also broken down, and fresh  glands are formed for the imago.    A large part of the substance of an insect larva consists of muscular  tissue, surrounding the digestive tube, and forming the great muscles  that move the various parts of the body, and of fat, surrounding the  organs and serving as a store of food-material. Very many of the  muscle-fibres and the fat-cells also become disintegrated during the  late larval and pupal stages, and the corresponding tissues of the adult  are new formations derived from special groups of imaginal cells, though  some muscles may persist from the larva to the adult. Similarly the  complex air-tube or tracheal system of the larva is broken down and a  fresh set of tubes is developed, adapted to the altered body-form of  pupa and imago.    The destruction of larval tissue and the development of replacing organs  from special groups of cells, derived of course from the embryo, and  carrying on the continuity of cell-lineage to the adult, are among the  most remarkable facts connected with the life-story of insects. The  process of tissue-destruction is known as 'histolysis'; the rebuilding  process is called 'histogenesis.' Considerable difference of opinion has  existed as to factors causing histolysis, and for a summary of the  conflicting or complementary theories, the reader is referred to the  work of L.F. Henneguy (1904, pp. 677-684). In the histolysis of the  two-winged flies, wandering amoeboid cells--like the white corpuscles or  leucocytes of vertebrate blood--have been observed destroying the larval  tissues that need to be broken down, as they destroy invading  micro-organisms in the body. But students of the internal changes that  accompany transformation in insects of other orders have often been  unable to observe such devouring activity of these 'phagocytes,' and  attribute the dissolution of the larval tissues to internal chemical  changes. The fact that in all insect transformation a part, and in many  a large part, of the larval organs pass over to the pupa and imago,  suggests that only those structures whose work is done are broken down  through the action of internally formed destructive substances, and one  function of the phagocytes is to act as scavengers by devouring what has  become effete and useless.          CHAPTER VI    LARVAE AND THEIR ADAPTATIONS      Among the insects that undergo a complete transformation, there is, as  we have seen in the preceding chapter, an amount of inward change, of  dissolution and rebuilding of tissues, that varies in its completeness  in members of different orders. It is now advisable to consider the  various outward forms assumed by the larvae of these insects, or rather  by a few examples chosen from a vast array of well-nigh 'infinite  variety.'    In comparing the transformations of endopterygote insects of different  orders, it is worthy of notice that in some cases all the members of an  order have larvae remarkably constant in their main structural features,  while in others there is great variety of larval form within the order.  For example, the caterpillars of all Lepidoptera are fundamentally much  alike, while the grubs of beetles of different families diverge widely  from one another. A review of a selected series of beetle-larvae will  therefore serve well to introduce this branch of the subject.    [Illustration: Fig. 12. _a_, Carrion-beetle (_Silpha_) with its larva,  _b_. Magnified, _a_ 3 times, and _b_ 4 times.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13. Larva of a Ground-beetle (_Aepus_). Magnified  6 times. After Westwood, _Modern Classification of Insects_.]    Beetles are as a rule remarkable among insects for the firm consistency  of their chitinous cuticle, the various pieces (_sclerites_) of which  are fitted together with admirable precision. In some families of  beetles the larva also is furnished with a complete chitinous armour,  the sclerites, both dorsal and ventral, of the successive body-segments  being hard and firm, while the relatively long legs possess well-defined  segments and are often spiny. Such a larva is evidently far less unlike  its parent beetle than a caterpillar is unlike a butterfly. Perhaps of  all beetle larvae, the woodlouse-like grub (fig. 12 _b_) of a  carrion-beetle (Silpha) or of a semi-aquatic dascillid such as Helodes  shows the least amount of difference from the typical adult, on account  of the conspicuous jointed feelers. The larval glow-worm, however, is of  the same woodlouse-like aspect, and in this case, where the female never  acquires wings, but becomes mature in a form which does not differ  markedly from that of the larva, the exceptional resemblance is closer  still. In all beetle-grubs the legs are simplified, there being only one  segment (a combined shin and foot) below the knee-joint, whereas in the  adult there is a shin followed by five, four, or at least three  distinct tarsal segments. The foot of an adult beetle bears two claws  at its tip, while the larval foot in the great majority of families has  only one claw. In one section of the order, however, the Adephaga  comprising the predaceous terrestrial and aquatic beetles, the larval  foot has, like that of the adult, two claws. Some adephagous larvae,  notably those of the large carnivorous water-beetles (Dyticus), often  destructive to tadpoles and young fish, have completely armoured bodies  as well as long jointed legs. More commonly, as with most of the  well-known Ground-beetles (Carabidae), the cuticle is less consistently  hard, firm sclerites segmentally arranged alternating with considerable  tracts of cuticle which remain feebly chitinised and flexible. Most of  the adephagous larvae (fig. 13) have a pair of stiff processes on the  ninth abdominal segment, and the insect, from its general likeness to a  bristle-tail of the genus Campodea, is often called a _campodeiform_  larva (Brauer, 1869). From such as these, a series of forms can be  traced among larvae of beetles, showing an increasing divergence from  the imago. The well-known wireworms--grubs of the Click-beetles  (Elateridae)--that eat the roots of farm crops, have well-armoured  bodies, but their shape is elongate, cylindrical, worm-like; and their  legs are relatively short, the build of the insect being adapted for  rapid motion through the soil. The grubs of the Chafers (Scarabaeidae)  are also root-eaters, but they are less active in their habits than the  wireworms, and the cuticle of their somewhat stout bodies is, for the  most part, pale and flexible; only the head and legs are hard and horny.  Usually an evident correspondence can be traced between the outward form  of any larva and its mode of life. For example, in the family of the  Leaf-beetles (Chrysomelidae) some larvae feed openly on the foliage of  trees or herbs, while others burrow into the plant tissues. The exposed  larvae of the Willow-beetles (Phyllodecta, fig. 14) have their somewhat  abbreviated body segments protected by numerous spine-bearing, firm  tubercles. But the grub of the 'Turnip Fly' (Phyllotreta) which feeds  between the upper and lower skins of a leaf, or of _Psylliodes  chrysocephala_ (fig. 15), which burrows in stalks, has a pale, soft  cuticle like that of a caterpillar.

(_a_) Cabbage-beetle (_Psylliodes chrysocephala_)  magnified 5 times, and its larva (_b_) magnified 12 times.]    In the larvae of the little timber-beetles and their allies (Ptinidae),  including the 'death-watches' whose tapping in old furniture is often  heard, a marked shortening of the legs and reduction in the size of the  head accompany the whitening and softening of the cuticle. This  shortening of the legs is still more marked in the larvae of the  Longhorn Beetles (Cerambycidae) burrowing in the wood of trees or felled  trunks; here the legs are reduced to small vestiges.    [Illustration: Fig. 16. _a_, Grain Weevil (_Calandra granaria_); _b_,  larva; _c_, pupa. Magnified 7 times. After Chittenden, _Yearbook U.S.  Dept. Agric._ 1894.]    Finally in the large family of the Weevils (Curculionidae, fig. 16) and  the Bark-beetles (Scolytidae), the grubs, eating underground root or  stem structures, mining in leaves or seeds, or tunnelling beneath the  bark of trees, have no legs at all, the place of these limbs being  indicated only by tiny tubercles on the"]]]
