And yet so removed  from the actual visual appearance is our mental idea of objects that  such drawings do convey a very accurate idea of a building or object.  And of course they have great advantage as working drawings in that they  can be scaled.    [Illustration: Diagram I.    A. TYPE OF FIRST DRAWING MADE BY CHILDREN, SHOWING HOW VISION HAS NOT  BEEN CONSULTED    B. TYPE OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IF CRUDEST EXPRESSION OF VISUAL  APPEARANCE HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED]    If so early the sense of vision is neglected and relegated to be the  handmaiden of other senses, it is no wonder that in the average adult it  is in such a shocking state of neglect. I feel convinced that with the  great majority of people vision is seldom if ever consulted for itself,  but only to minister to some other sense. They look at the sky to see if  it is going to be fine; at the fields to see if they are dry enough to  walk on, or whether there will be a good crop of hay; at the stream not  to observe the beauty of the reflections from the blue sky or green  fields dancing upon its surface or the rich colouring of its shadowed  depths, but to calculate how deep it is or how much power it would  supply to work a mill, how many fish it contains, or some other  association alien to its visual aspect. If one looks up at a fine mass  of cumulus clouds above a London street, the ordinary passer-by who  follows one's gaze expects to see a balloon or a flying-machine at  least, and when he sees it is only clouds he is apt to wonder what one  is gazing at. The beautiful form and colour of the cloud seem to be  unobserved. Clouds mean nothing to him but an accumulation of water dust  that may bring rain. This accounts in some way for the number of good  paintings that are incomprehensible to the majority of people. It is  only those pictures that pursue the visual aspect of objects to a  sufficient completion to contain the suggestion of these other  associations, that they understand at all. Other pictures, they say, are  not finished enough. And it is so seldom that a picture can have this  petty realisation and at the same time be an expression of those larger  emotional qualities that constitute good painting.    The early paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood appear to be a  striking exception to this. But in their work the excessive realisation  of all details was part of the expression and gave emphasis to the  poetic idea at the basis of their pictures, and was therefore part of  the artistic intention. In these paintings the fiery intensity with  which every little detail was painted made their picture a ready medium  for the expression of poetic thought, a sort of \"painted poetry,\" every  detail being selected on account of some symbolic meaning it had,  bearing on the poetic idea that was the object of the picture.    But to those painters who do not attempt \"painted poetry,\" but seek in  painting a poetry of its own, a visual poetry, this excessive finish (as  it is called) is irksome, as it mars the expression of those qualities  in vision they wish to express. Finish in art has no connection with the  amount of detail in a picture, but has reference only to the  completeness with which the emotional idea the painter set out to  express has been realised.    [Illustration: Plate VIII.    STUDY FOR A PICTURE    In red conte chalk and white pastel rubbed on toned paper.]    The visual blindness of the majority of people is greatly to be  deplored, as nature is ever offering them on their retina, even in the  meanest slum, a music of colour and form that is a constant source of  pleasure to those who can see it. But so many are content to use this  wonderful faculty of vision for utilitarian purposes only. It is the  privilege of the artist to show how wonderful and beautiful is all this  music of colour and form, so that people, having been moved by it in his  work, may be encouraged to see the same beauty in the things around  them. This is the best argument in favour of making art a subject of  general education: that it should teach people to see. Everybody does  not need to draw and paint, but if everybody could get the faculty of  appreciating the form and colour on their retinas as form and colour,  what a wealth would always be at their disposal for enjoyment! The  Japanese habit of looking at a landscape upside down between their legs  is a way of seeing without the deadening influence of touch  associations. Thus looking, one is surprised into seeing for once the  colour and form of things with the association of touch for the moment  forgotten, and is puzzled at the beauty. The odd thing is that although  thus we see things upside down, the pictures on our retinas are for once  the right way up; for ordinarily the visual picture is inverted on the  retina, like that on the ground glass at the back of a photographic  camera.    To sum up this somewhat rambling chapter, I have endeavoured to show  that there are two aspects from which the objective world can be  apprehended. There is the purely mental perception founded chiefly on  knowledge derived from our sense of touch associated with vision, whose  primitive instinct is to put an outline round objects as representing  their boundaries in space. And secondly, there is the visual perception,  which is concerned with the visual aspects of objects as they appear on  the retina; an arrangement of colour shapes, a sort of mosaic of colour.  And these two aspects give us two different points of view from which  the representation of visible things can be approached.    When the representation from either point of view is carried far enough,  the result is very similar. Work built up on outline drawing to which  has been added light and shade, colour, aerial perspective, &c., may  eventually approximate to the perfect visual appearance. And inversely,  representations approached from the point of view of pure vision, the  mosaic of colour on the retina, if pushed far enough, may satisfy the  mental perception of form with its touch associations. And of course the  two points of view are intimately connected. You cannot put an accurate  outline round an object without observing the shape it occupies in the  field of vision. And it is difficult to consider the \"mosaic of colour  forms\" without being very conscious of the objective significance of the  colour masses portrayed. But they present two entirely different and  opposite points of view from which the representation of objects can be  approached. In considering the subject of drawing I think it necessary  to make this division of the subject, and both methods of form  expression should be studied by the student. Let us call the first  method Line Drawing and the second Mass Drawing. Most modern drawing is  a mixture of both these points of view, but they should be studied  separately if confusion is to be avoided. If the student neglects line  drawing, his work will lack the expressive significance of form that  only a feeling for lines seems to have the secret of conveying; while,  if he neglects mass drawing, he will be poorly equipped when he comes to  express form with a brush full of paint to work with.          IV    LINE DRAWING      Most of the earliest forms of drawing known to us in history, like those  of the child we were discussing in the last chapter, are largely in the  nature of outline drawings. This is a remarkable fact considering the  somewhat remote relation lines have to the complete phenomena of vision.  Outlines can only be said to exist in appearances as the boundaries of  masses. But even here a line seems a poor thing from the visual point of  view; as the boundaries are not always clearly defined, but are  continually merging into the surrounding mass and losing themselves to  be caught up again later on and defined once more. Its relationship with  visual appearances is not sufficient to justify the instinct for line  drawing. It comes, I think, as has already been said, from the sense of  touch. When an object is felt there is no merging in the surrounding  mass, but a firm definition of its boundary, which the mind  instinctively conceives as a line.    There is a more direct appeal to the imagination in line drawing than in  possibly anything else in pictorial art. The emotional stimulus given by  fine design is due largely to line work. The power a line possesses of  instinctively directing the eye along its course is of the utmost value  also, enabling the artist to concentrate the attention of the beholder  where he wishes. Then there is a harmonic sense in lines and their  relationships, a music of line that is found at the basis of all good  art. But this subject will be treated later on when talking of line  rhythm.    Most artists whose work makes a large appeal to the imagination are  strong on the value of line. Blake, whose visual knowledge was such a  negligible quantity, but whose mental perceptions were so magnificent,  was always insisting on its value. And his designs are splendid examples  of its powerful appeal to the imagination.    On this basis of line drawing the development of art proceeded. The  early Egyptian wall paintings were outlines tinted, and the earliest  wall sculpture was an incised outline. After these incised lines some  man of genius thought of cutting away the surface of the wall between  the outlines and modelling it in low relief. The appearance of this may  have suggested to the man painting his outline on the wall the idea of  shading between his outlines.    At any rate the next development was the introduction of a little  shading to relieve the flatness of the line-work and suggest modelling.  And this was "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1429"],[0,"The Garden Party, and Other Stories (#7)"],[1," used to  anything.\"    \"Does one? Hum!\" The \"Hum\" was so deep it seemed to boom from underneath  the ground. \"I wonder how it's done,\" brooded Jonathan; \"I've never  managed it.\"    Looking at him as he lay there, Linda thought again how attractive he  was. It was strange to think that he was only an ordinary clerk, that  Stanley earned twice as much money as he. What was the matter with  Jonathan? He had no ambition; she supposed that was it. And yet one felt  he was gifted, exceptional. He was passionately fond of music; every  spare penny he had went on books. He was always full of new ideas,  schemes, plans. But nothing came of it all. The new fire blazed in  Jonathan; you almost heard it roaring softly as he explained, described  and dilated on the new thing; but a moment later it had fallen in and  there was nothing but ashes, and Jonathan went about with a look like  hunger in his black eyes. At these times he exaggerated his absurd  manner of speaking, and he sang in church--he was the leader of the  choir--with such fearful dramatic intensity that the meanest hymn put on  an unholy splendour.    \"It seems to me just as imbecile, just as infernal, to have to go to the  office on Monday,\" said Jonathan, \"as it always has done and always will  do. To spend all the best years of one's life sitting on a stool from  nine to five, scratching in somebody's ledger! It's a queer use to make  of one's... one and only life, isn't it? Or do I fondly dream?\" He  rolled over on the grass and looked up at Linda. \"Tell me, what is the  difference between my life and that of an ordinary prisoner. The only  difference I can see is that I put myself in jail and nobody's ever  going to let me out. That's a more intolerable situation than the other.  For if I'd been--pushed in, against my will--kicking, even--once the  door was locked, or at any rate in five years or so, I might have  accepted the fact and begun to take an interest in the flight of  flies or counting the warder's steps along the passage with particular  attention to variations of tread and so on. But as it is, I'm like an  insect that's flown into a room of its own accord. I dash against the  walls, dash against the windows, flop against the ceiling, do everything  on God's earth, in fact, except fly out again. And all the while I'm  thinking, like that moth, or that butterfly, or whatever it is, 'The  shortness of life! The shortness of life!' I've only one night or  one day, and there's this vast dangerous garden, waiting out there,  undiscovered, unexplored.\"    \"But, if you feel like that, why--\" began Linda quickly.    \"Ah!\" cried Jonathan. And that \"ah!\" was somehow almost exultant.  \"There you have me. Why? Why indeed? There's the maddening, mysterious  question. Why don't I fly out again? There's the window or the door or  whatever it was I came in by. It's not hopelessly shut--is it? Why don't  I find it and be off? Answer me that, little sister.\" But he gave her no  time to answer.    \"I'm exactly like that insect again. For some reason\"--Jonathan paused  between the words--\"it's not allowed, it's forbidden, it's against the  insect law, to stop banging and flopping and crawling up the pane even  for an instant. Why don't I leave the office? Why don't I seriously  consider, this moment, for instance, what it is that prevents me  leaving? It's not as though I'm tremendously tied. I've two boys to  provide for, but, after all, they're boys. I could cut off to sea, or  get a job up-country, or--\" Suddenly he smiled at Linda and said in  a changed voice, as if he were confiding a secret, \"Weak... weak. No  stamina. No anchor. No guiding principle, let us call it.\" But then the  dark velvety voice rolled out:         \"Would ye hear the story        How it unfolds itself... \"    and they were silent.    The sun had set. In the western sky there were great masses of  crushed-up rose-coloured clouds. Broad beams of light shone through the  clouds and beyond them as if they would cover the whole sky. Overhead  the blue faded; it turned a pale gold, and the bush outlined against  it gleamed dark and brilliant like metal. Sometimes when those beams of  light show in the sky they are very awful. They remind you that up there  sits Jehovah, the jealous God, the Almighty, Whose eye is upon you, ever  watchful, never weary. You remember that at His coming the whole earth  will shake into one ruined graveyard; the cold, bright angels will drive  you this way and that, and there will be no time to explain what could  be explained so simply... But to-night it seemed to Linda there was  something infinitely joyful and loving in those silver beams. And now  no sound came from the sea. It breathed softly as if it would draw that  tender, joyful beauty into its own bosom.    \"It's all wrong, it's all wrong,\" came the shadowy voice of Jonathan.  \"It's not the scene, it's not the setting for... three stools, three  desks, three inkpots and a wire blind.\"    Linda knew that he would never change, but she said, \"Is it too late,  even now?\"    \"I'm old--I'm old,\" intoned Jonathan. He bent towards her, he passed his  hand over his head. \"Look!\" His black hair was speckled all over with  silver, like the breast plumage of a black fowl.    Linda was surprised. She had no idea that he was grey. And yet, as he  stood up beside her and sighed and stretched, she saw him, for the first  time, not resolute, not gallant, not careless, but touched already with  age. He looked very tall on the darkening grass, and the thought crossed  her mind, \"He is like a weed.\"    Jonathan stooped again and kissed her fingers.    \"Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine,\" he murmured. \"I must go  seek those heirs to my fame and fortune... \" He was gone.      Chapter 1.XI.    Light shone in the windows of the bungalow. Two square patches of gold  fell upon the pinks and the peaked marigolds. Florrie, the cat, came  out on to the veranda, and sat on the top step, her white paws close  together, her tail curled round. She looked content, as though she had  been waiting for this moment all day.    \"Thank goodness, it's getting late,\" said Florrie. \"Thank goodness, the  long day is over.\" Her greengage eyes opened.    Presently there sounded the rumble of the coach, the crack of Kelly's  whip. It came near enough for one to hear the voices of the men from  town, talking loudly together. It stopped at the Burnells' gate.    Stanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda. \"Is that you,  darling?\"    \"Yes, Stanley.\"    He leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms. She was  enfolded in that familiar, eager, strong embrace.    \"Forgive me, darling, forgive me,\" stammered Stanley, and he put his  hand under her chin and lifted her face to him.    \"Forgive you?\" smiled Linda. \"But whatever for?\"    \"Good God! You can't have forgotten,\" cried Stanley Burnell. \"I've  thought of nothing else all day. I've had the hell of a day. I made up  my mind to dash out and telegraph, and then I thought the wire mightn't  reach you before I did. I've been in tortures, Linda.\"    \"But, Stanley,\" said Linda, \"what must I forgive you for?\"    \"Linda!\"--Stanley was very hurt--\"didn't you realize--you must have  realized--I went away without saying good-bye to you this morning? I  can't imagine how I can have done such a thing. My confounded temper, of  course. But--well\"--and he sighed and took her in his arms again--\"I've  suffered for it enough to-day.\"    \"What's that you've got in your hand?\" asked Linda. \"New gloves? Let me  see.\"    \"Oh, just a cheap pair of wash-leather ones,\" said Stanley humbly. \"I  noticed Bell was wearing some in the coach this morning, so, as I  was passing the shop, I dashed in and got myself a pair. What are you  smiling at? You don't think it was wrong of me, do you?\"    \"On the con-trary, darling,\" said Linda, \"I think it was most sensible.\"    She pulled one of the large, pale gloves on her own fingers and looked  at her hand, turning it this way and that. She was still smiling.    Stanley wanted to say, \"I was thinking of you the whole time I bought  them.\" It was true, but for some reason he couldn't say it. \"Let's go  in,\" said he.      Chapter 1.XII.    Why does one feel so different at night? Why is it so exciting to be  awake when everybody else is asleep? Late--it is very late! And yet  every moment you feel more and more wakeful, as though you were slowly,  almost with every breath, waking up into a new, wonderful, far more  thrilling and exciting world than the daylight one. And what is this  queer sensation that you're a conspirator? Lightly, stealthily you move  about your room. You take something off the dressing-table and put it  down again without a sound. And everything, even the bed-post, knows  you, responds, shares your secret...    You're not very fond of your room by day. You never think about it.  You're in and out, the door opens and slams, the cupboard creaks. You  sit down on the side of your bed, change your shoes and dash out again.  A dive down to the glass, two pins in your hair, powder your nose and  off again. But now--it's suddenly dear to you. It's a darling little  funny room. It's yours. Oh, what a joy it is to own things! Mine--my  own!    \"My very own for ever?\"    \"Yes.\" Their lips met.    No, of course, that had nothing to do with it. That was all nonsense  and rubbish. But, in spite of herself, Beryl saw so plainly two people  standing in the middle of her room. Her arms were round his neck; he  held her. And now he whispered, \"My beauty, my little beauty!\"  She jumped off her bed, ran over to the window and kneeled on the  window-seat, with her elbows on the sill. But the beautiful night, the  garden, every bush, every leaf, even the white palings, even the stars,  were conspirators too. So bright was the moon that the flowers were  bright as by day; the shadow of the nasturtiums, exquisite lily-like  leaves and wide-open flowers,"]]]
