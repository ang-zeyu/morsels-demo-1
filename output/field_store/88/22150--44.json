If the student in American history is asked to go to the board at  intervals and write an outline for the work covered on such topics as  the following, he will come much nearer understanding the progress of  our people:--         1. History of the tariff.         2. Political parties and principles for which they stood.         3. Things that crystallized Northern sentiment against slavery.         4. Reasons for the unification of the South.         5. Diplomatic relations of the United States.         6. Additions of territory.         7. Financial legislation.         8. Growth of humanitarian spirit.    There will easily be sufficient topics so that each member of the class  will have a different one. They can all work at the board,  simultaneously. The amount of time used for exercises of this sort need  not be great, and the value received is incalculable.    If the teacher wishes to review briefly on the military, diplomatic,  social, political, or economic history of the people the class have been  studying, it is no difficult matter to arrange a set of questions, the  occasional review in which will clinch in the student's mind what  otherwise would surely be forgotten. Such questions as the following on  the financial history of the United States are each answerable with a  few words and will serve as an illustration of the method which may be  employed in reviewing any other phase of history:--         1. By what means was trade accomplished before the use of money?         2. What are the functions of money?         3. What determines the amount of money needed in a country?         4.

What is meant by \"Standard Money\"?        43. With the market ratio at 30 to 1 and the mint ratio at 16 to 1,          which money would tend to disappear from circulation if both          metals are freely coined and made full legal tender?        44.

Are deposits guaranteed?        56. May States emit bills of credit?        57. Is it constitutional for banks chartered by the State to emit          bills of credit?        58. Do they do so to-day?        59. Why?    Obviously as the year advances, the list of questions for review grows  longer. An increasing amount of time should therefore be devoted to work  of this sort.      _They will insure a better acquaintance with great men and women_    The most superficial observation will suffice to convince anyone that  high school graduates know very little about the great men and women of  history. The character sketches suggested earlier in the chapter,  supplemented with occasional reviews, will do much to improve this  condition. These drills may be conducted by asking for brief statements  on the greatest service or the most distinguishing characteristic of the  great men and women met with in the course. The same thing is  accomplished by reversing the process and asking such questions  as,--\"Who was the American Fabius\"? or \"The Great Compromiser\"? or the  \"Sage of Menlo Park\"? etc. Questions on the authorship of great  documents, the founders of institutions, the organizers of movements,  reformers, philosophers, artists, statesmen, generals, accomplish the  same purpose.      _They will be economical of time_    There are a vast number of review questions answerable with _yes_ or  _no_. The student's knowledge of the subject may be quickly discovered  and a rapid review conducted by a series of such questions. The  following list on American history will illustrate the method:--         1. Was Cromwell's colonial policy helpful to the American colonies?         2. Did the Revolution of 1688 have any effect on the colonies?         3. Were the Huguenots excluded from Canada?         4. Were the Writs of Assistance used in England?         5.

Did Lincoln's assassination have any effect on the          reconstruction policy?        26. Does the Federal Constitution compel negro suffrage?        27. Was the Anaconda System successful?        28. Was a President of the United States ever impeached?        29. Were the claims for indirect damages in the Alabama claims          allowed?        30. Did Calhoun favor the Compromise of 1850?        31. Did Thaddeus Stevens favor the Fifteenth Amendment to the          Constitution?        32. Did Lincoln favor the social equality of the white and black          races?        33. Did Grant favor the Tenure of Office Act?        34. Did Lee make more than one attempt to invade the North?        35. Was the \"Ohio Idea\" ever strong enough to affect legislation?        36.

Has the Republican party ever reduced the protective tariffs of          the war?        43. Did the Civil Service Act passed in 1883 include postmasters?        44. Did the Wilson-Gorman Act reduce the tariff to a revenue basis?        45. Can a railway engaged solely in intra-state business carry a          case, involving a reduction of their rates by the State          legislature, to the Supreme Court of the United States?        46. Is Utah a part of the Louisiana Purchase?        47. If the mint ratio is 16 to 1 and the market ratio is 17 to 1,          will the gold dollar be the standard if there is full legal          tender and free coinage for both gold and silver?        48.

Even the most advanced animals, like dolphins, have no tendency  towards level 3.    The first drawings on cave walls were dated back to about 150000 years ago.  Such drawings must be produced by some long-range image-models. But, such  drawings are of no use without some explanations (symbolic messages). The  reason is that the same drawing can be associated with a lot of situations. It  is fair to consider that, at that moment, the primitive human beings were able  to use a symbolic model for communication (a primitive language).    One idea is that the increasing capacity of the brain to make long range  image-models was a support to make also symbolic models. This idea cannot be  supported, based on MDT.    Indeed, the drawings made by 5 to 12 year old children are rather primitive  drawings. At such age, children have very few long-range models. But they are  able to make and operate symbolic models, including languages to communicate  with computers.    Thus, it seems that the long-range image models are not necessary to make  symbolic models. Also, this supports the idea that the symbolic models are  made by a special hardware.    The existence of a specialized hardware is based on the following:    There is an image model and the associated label-model (a word). The word has  a definition (based on other words). It is clear that there must be a hardware  to record the image-model and another (associated) hardware to record the  definition. On level 4, the image model does not exist anymore.    If this new hardware should be build based on evolution, it is difficult to  understand why we have no intermediate stages. The dolphins, which are  considered as the most advanced animals, have no tendency to build symbolic  models.    There are some experiments with monkeys, which can be understood as support  that some monkeys are able to make symbolic models. Such cases can be  generated by a software implementation of the function to build and operate  symbolic models.    As we already know, a model in PSM is very efficient but it blocks the  evolution (the model is transmitted unchanged or with small changes, from a  generation to another).  If an animal builds, e.g. by accident, an advanced  model of interaction with the external reality, such a model cannot be  transmitted to the next generation. Only if a hardware implementation exists,  a new model will be transmitted to the next generation. This seems to be a big  problem for the evolution of the beings.    Without a hardware implementation, the solution is to transmit such models  based on education. If there were groups of monkeys which lived together for a  very long time, then a good model could be transmitted from a generation to  another by education. In this way, a hardware implementation is built up also  if the time available is long enough.    After many generations of monkeys who are forced to build symbolic models, it  is possible, theoretically, that some hardware occurs to support the symbolic  model building. This could be the process that generated the human brain by an  evolution process.    The main argument against evolution from animals to humans is the fact that  the 2 years old children are able to build and operate symbolic models. At  that age they haven't either enough long-range models to understand the  external reality and they are not capable to build such models. The maturity  of a human being is reached around the age of 18, and thus the facility to  build symbolic models is clearly a hardware facility.    Conclusions:  1. Long-range image-models are not an explanation for the occurrence of  symbolic models.  2. The symbolic-models could occur from image-models by a huge increase in the  level of conceptualization in very special conditions (e.g. large groups of  monkeys which live together for a very long time).  3. The symbolic-models are built and operated by a specialized hardware.    There are two possibilities: either evolution if statement 2 is valid or  external intervention if not.        BASIC DESIGN DEFFICIENCIES OF THE HUMAN BRAIN    The theory treats the brain as a technological product. So, the theory  considers that a designer existed. He had to fulfil some design requirements.  Any technological design has some deficiencies. We shall guess them in this  section.    This theoretical and abstract designer is outside of the theory and we are not  interested by it. It could be \"Mother Nature\" or God or an extraterrestrial  civilization or anything else.    These deficiencies are described here mainly for the human brain, but some can  be met also in the animal brain. The design deficiencies as MDT can detect  them, are:    XD1: The tendency to associate an image-model to any situation met by a  person. This deficiency is explained due to the \"image nature\" of the brain.  This deficiency explains why so many persons \"stay\" on level 3, when level 5  is accessible since 100 years ago. This deficiency can be corrected by  education.    XD2: There is no hardware protection to prevent the uncontrolled jump from a  model to another, in interaction with a complex external reality. The  stability in a model is a quality parameter of a brain.    Long-range models can stabilize a person. The XD2 deficiency is not related to  them. XD2 is related to the capacity to stay in a model, when faced with a  complex external reality. This deficiency can be corrected by software  (education, for instance).    The lack of stability in a model can induce the illness called schizophrenia  because this lack of stability has the tendency to favor short-range models.  Indeed, when there is no stability in a model, the brain will make a  specialized model for any particular situation met in the external reality.  Such models are not able to see that some different facts can be correlated.  Only a long-range model can detect such correlation. So, the stability in a  model is a parameter of quality for a brain and the lack of stability  indicates a low quality brain.    This deficiency can be met in the animal world too. For example, a dog has to  watch a perimeter. That dog can jump from watch-model to food-model, if it  gets food from strangers. Such a dog is a low quality dog, due to the lack of  stability in the model.    The dolphins have a good stability in a model, and so, we consider them as  advanced animals.    For human beings, the lack of stability in a model is a major drawback. Such  persons are not good for any complex activity.    XD3: This is a basic deficiency. Let's start with its description, based on  examples.    So, the brain interacts with an external reality and makes a harmonic model  with 3 elements. If, that external reality has, in fact, 4 elements, the  missing element cannot be discovered based on the 3-element model. As a 3-  element model has a number of wrong predictions, it is not easy to see what is  the problem from the analysis of the mistakes. The reason is that, once the 3-  element model is activated, the reality is just that one which is generated by  this model. There is no other reality! We cannot be outside of our active  model. In such a case, the brain tries to correct the model. Usually, it will  try to correct the model by changing the importance of some elements or  relations. Sometimes this procedure works, and the brain will continue to use  the 3-element model.    Such a situation occurs when we have not enough long-range models. In the  above example, the situation can be corrected if there is a long-range model,  which contains a 3-element model as an element of it. But even so, by  analyzing the mistakes, it is not easy to understand what is the problem.    A brain affected by XD3A is not able to predict that a model might be missing  some elements. A person, who can fight XD3A, can predict such a situation and  will treat any model as preliminary.    The brain makes models based on the available data. Such models are made in a  harmonic/logic way, but the stability of a model is not a guarantee that the  model is good in interaction with a complex external reality.    We define XD3A as a design deficiency, which means that a brain is not able to  predict the possibility of a missing element or relation in a stable (harmonic  or logic) model.    Another case: a brain has a stabilized model with 100 elements. This model  already generated a big number of correct predictions. At one moment, the  external reality is changed, and now there are 101 elements. As we know, to  correct a model means to reconstruct everything from scratch, using or not  components from the old model. This task could be so difficult that it exceeds  the technical capacity of the brain. In such a situation the old model is  fragmented, and the brain uses it in this way. Of course, this can produce a  lot of negative effects, including induced psychiatric disorders.    We define XD3B as a design deficiency, which means that a brain is not able to  reconstruct a model, once the model is detected as a wrong model in  association with a new external reality. We can express this also as the  impossibility of a brain to correct a XD3A deficiency, once it was discovered.    XD3-deficiencies are widespread in the current activity of human beings. There  is no reference to know that all the entities of the external reality are  associated with the right YMs in the associated model. For us, the external  reality exists only if it is associated with a model. Once we activated such a  model, the reality is what the model says. We cannot be outside of our active  model.    Once we have a model associated with a specific external reality, the model is  considered as a good model based on the predictions which are already done.  There is no guarantee that the model will continue to be good in any situation  and any time. A good quality brain has to know this and to predict some  negative"]]]
