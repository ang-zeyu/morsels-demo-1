No sooner was he invested with power than he  abused it strangely; he levied upon the clergy as well as the people an  enormous talliage, and the use he made of the money increased still  further the wrath of the public.  An Augustine monk, named James Legrand,  already celebrated for his writings, had the hardihood to preach even  before the court against abuses of power and licentiousness of morals.  The king rose up from his own place, and went and sat down right opposite  the preacher.  \"Yes, sir,\" continued the monk, \"the king your father,  during his reign, did likewise lay taxes upon the people, but with the  produce of them he built fortresses for the defence of the kingdom, he  hurled back the enemy and took possession of their towns, and he effected  a saving of treasure which made him the most powerful amongst the kings  of the West.  But now, there is nothing of this kind done; the height of  nobility in the present day is to frequent bagnios, to live in  debauchery, to wear rich dresses with pretty fringes and big cuffs.  This, O queen,\" he added, \"is what is said to the shame of the court;  and, if you will not believe me, put on the dress of some poor woman and  walk about the city, and you will hear it talked of by plenty of people.\"  In spite of his malady and his affection for his brother, Charles VI.,  either from pure feebleness or because he was struck by those truths so  boldly proclaimed, yielded to the counsels of certain wise men who  represented to him \"that it was neither a reasonable nor an honorable  thing to intrust the government of the realm to a prince whose youth  needed rather to be governed than to govern.\"  He withdrew the direction  of affairs from the Duke of Orleans and restored it to the Duke of  Burgundy, who took it again and held it with a strong grasp, and did  not suffer his nephew Louis to meddle in anything.  But from that time  forward open distrust and hatred were established between the two princes  and their families.  In the very midst of this court-crisis Duke Philip  the Bold fell ill and died within a few days, on the 27th of April, 1404.  He was a prince valiant and able, ambitious, imperious, eager in the  pursuit of his own personal interests, careful in humoring those whom he  aspired to rule, and disposed to do them good service in whatever was not  opposed to his own ends.  He deserved and possessed the confidence and  affection not only of his father, King John, but also of his brother,  Charles V., a good judge of wisdom and fidelity.  He founded that great  house of Burgundy which was for more than a century to eclipse and often  to deplorably compromise France; but Philip the Bold loved France  sincerely, and always gave her the chief place in his policy.  His  private life was regular and staid, amidst the scandalous licentiousness  of his court.  He was of those who leave behind them unfeigned regret and  an honored memory, without having inspired their contemporaries with any  lively sympathy.    John the Fearless, Count of Nevers, his son and successor in the dukedom  of Burgundy, was not slow to prove that there was reason to regret his  father.  His expedition to Hungary, for all its bad leadership and bad  fortune, had created esteem for his courage and for his firmness under  reverses, but little confidence in his direction of public affairs.  He  was a man of violence, unscrupulous and indiscreet, full of jealousy and  hatred, and capable of any deed and any risk for the gratification of his  passions or his fancies.  At his accession he made some popular moves; he  appeared disposed to prosecute vigorously the war against England, which  was going on sluggishly; he testified a certain spirit of conciliation by  going to pay a visit to his cousin, the Duke of Orleans, lying ill at his  castle of Beaute, near Vincennes; when the Duke of Orleans was well  again, the two princes took the communion together, and dined together at  their uncle's, the Duke of Berry's; and the Duke of Orleans invited the  new Duke of Burgundy to dine with him the next Sunday.  The Parisians  took pleasure in observing these little matters, and in hoping for the  re-establishment of harmony in the royal family.  They were soon to be  cruelly undeceived.    On the 23d of November, 1407, the Duke of Orleans had dined at Queen  Isabel's.  He was returning about eight in the evening along Vieille Rue  du Temple, singing and playing with his glove, and attended by only two  squires riding one horse, and by four or five varlets on foot, carrying  torches.  It was a gloomy night; not a soul in the streets.  When the  duke was about a hundred paces from the queen's hostel, eighteen or  twenty armed men, who had lain in ambush behind a house called Image de  Notre-Dame, dashed suddenly out; the squires' horse took fright and ran  away with them; and the assassins rushed upon the duke, shouting, \"Death!  death!\"  \"What is all this?\" said he; \"I am the Duke of Orleans.\"  \"Just  what we want,\" was the answer; and they hurled him down from his mule.  He struggled to his knees; but the fellows struck at him heavily with axe  and sword.  A young man in his train made an effort to defend him, and  was immediately cut down; and another, grievously wounded, had but just  time to escape into a neighboring shop.  A poor cobbler's wife opened her  window, and, seeing the work of assassination, shrieked, \"Murder!  murder!\"  \"Hold your tongue, you strumpet!\" cried some one from the  street.  Others shot arrows at the windows where lookers-on might be.  A  tall man, wearing a red cap which came down over his eyes, said in a loud  voice, \"Out with all lights, and away!\" The assassins fled at the top of  their speed, shouting, \"Fire! fire!\" throwing behind them foot-trippers,  and by menaces causing all the lights to be put out which were being  lighted here and there in the shops.    [Illustration: Murder of the Duke of Orleans----38]    The duke was quite dead.  One of his squires, returning to the spot,  found his body stretched on the road, and mutilated all over.  He was  carried to the neighboring church of Blancs-Manteaux, whither all the  royal family came to render the last sad offices.  The Duke of Burgundy  appeared no less afflicted than the rest.  \"Never,\" said he, \"was a more  wicked and traitorous murder committed in this realm.\"  The provost of  Paris, Sire de Tignouville, set on foot an active search after the  perpetrators.  He was summoned before the council of princes, and the  Duke of Berry asked him if he had discovered anything.  \"I believe,\" said  the provost, \"that if I had leave to enter all the hostels of the king's  servants, and even of the princes, I could get on the track of the  authors or accomplices of the crime.\"  He was authorized to enter  wherever it seemed good to him.  He went away to set himself to work.  The Duke of Burgundy, looking troubled and growing pale, \"Cousin,\" said  the King of Naples, Louis d'Anjou, who was present at the council, \"can  you know aught about it?  You must tell us.\"  The Duke of Burgundy took  him, together with his uncle, the Duke of Berry, aside, and told them  that it was he himself who, tempted of the devil, had given orders for  this murder.  \"O God!\" cried the Duke of Berry, \"then I lose both my  nephews!\"  The Duke of Burgundy went out in great confusion, and the  council separated.  Research brought about the discovery that the crime  had been for a long while in preparation, and that a Norman nobleman,  Raoul d'Auquetonville, late receiver-general of finance, having been  deprived of his post by the Duke of Orleans for malversation, had been  the instrument.  The council of princes met the next day at the Hotel de  Nesle.  The Duke of Burgundy, who had recovered all his audacity, came to  take his seat there.  Word was sent to him not to enter the room.  Duke  John persisted; but the Duke of Berry went to the door and said to him,  \"Nephew, give up the notion of entering the council; you would not be  seen there with pleasure.\"  \"I give up willingly,\" answered Duke John;  \"and that none may be accused of putting to death the Duke of Orleans, I  declare that it was I, and none other, who caused the doing of what has  been done.\"  Thereupon he turned his horse's head, returned forthwith to  the Hotel d'Artois, and, taking only six men with him, he galloped  without a halt, except to change horses, to the frontier of Flanders.  The Duke of Bourbon complained bitterly at the council that an immediate  arrest had not been ordered.  The Admiral de Brabant, and a hundred of  the Duke of Orleans' knights, set out in pursuit, but were unable to come  up in time.  Neither Raoul d'Anquetonville nor any other of the assassins  was caught.  The magistrates, as well as the public, were seized with  stupor in view of so great a crime and so great a criminal.    But the Duke of Orleans left a widow who, in spite of his infidelities  and his irregularities, was passionately attached to him.  Valentine  Visconti, the Duke of Milan's daughter, whose dowry had gone to pay the  ransom of King John, was at Chateau-Thierry when she heard of her  husband's murder.  Hers was one of those natures, full of softness and at  the same time of fire, which grief does not overwhelm, and in which a  passion for vengeance is excited and fed by their despair.  She started  for Paris in the early part of December, 1407, during the roughest  winter, it was said, ever known for several centuries, taking with her  all her children.  The Duke of Berry, the Duke of Bourbon, the Count of  Clermont, and the constable went to meet her.  Herself and all her train  in deep mourning, she dismounted at the hostel of St. Paul, threw herself  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11954"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 4 (#7)"],[1,"ickingen, Leo X., would have been very  glad to have for emperor in Germany neither the King of France nor the  King of Spain, both of them being far too powerful in Europe and far too  emulous in Italy not to be dangerous enemies or inconvenient allies for  him; and he tried to dissuade Francis I. from making any claim to the  empire, and to induce him to employ his influence in bringing about the  election of a second-rate German prince, Frederick the Wise, Duke of  Saxony, who was justly popular in Germany, and who would never be in a  condition to do France any harm.  It was judicious advice and a policy  good for France as well as for Europe in general; but Francis I.,  infatuated by his desire and his hope, did not relish it at all; and Leo  X., being obliged to choose between the two great claimants, declared for  Francis I., without any pleasure or confidence, but also without any  great perplexity, for he had but little faith in the success which he  made a show of desiring.  Francis, deceived by these appearances and  promises, on the part both of ecclesiastics and laics, held language  breathing a gallant and almost careless confidence.  \"We are not enemies,  your master and I,\" he said to the ambassadors of Spain; \"we are two  lovers courting the same mistress: whichever of the two she may prefer,  the other will have to submit, and harbor no resentment.\"  But when,  shortly after Maximilian's death, the struggle became closer and the  issue nearer, the inequality between the forces and chances of the two  rivals became quite manifest, and Francis I. could no longer affect the  same serenity.  He had intrusted the management of his affairs in Germany  to a favorite comrade of his early youth, Admiral de Bonnivet, a soldier  and a courtier, witty, rash, sumptuous, eager to display his master's  power and magnificence.  Charles of Austria's agents, and at their head  his aunt Margaret, who had the government of the Low Countries in his  absence, were experienced, deliberate, discreet, more eager to succeed in  their purpose than to make a brilliant appearance, and resolved to do  quietly whatever was necessary for success.  And to do so they were  before long as fully authorized as they were resolved.  They discovered  that Francis I. had given Bonnivet four hundred thousand crowns in gold  that he might endeavor to bribe the electors; it was, according to  report, double the sum Charles of Austria had promised for the same  object; and his agents sent him information of it, and received this  answer: \"We are wholly determined to spare nothing and to stake all for  all upon it, as the matter we most desire and have most at heart in this  world.  .  .  .  The election must be secured, whatever it may cost me.\"  The question before the seven elective princes who were to dispose of the  empire was thenceforth merely which of the two claimants would be the  higher and the safer bidder.  Francis I. engaged in a tussle of wealth  and liberality with Charles of Austria.  One of his agents wrote to him,  \"All will go well if we can fill the maw of the Margrave Joachim of  Brandenburg; he and his brother the elector from Mayence fall every day  into deeper depths of avarice; we must hasten to satisfy them with  _speed, speed, speed_.\"  Francis I. replied, \"I will have Marquis Joachim  _gorged_ at any price;\" and he accordingly made over to him in ready  money and bills of short dates all that was asked for by the margrave,  who on the 8th of April, 1519, gave a written undertaking to support the  candidature \"of the most invincible and Most Christian prince, Francis,  by the grace of God King of the French, Duke of Milan, and Lord of Genoa,  who, what with his vigorous age, his ability, his justice, his military  experience, the brilliant fortune of his arms, and all other qualities  required for war and the management of the commonwealth, surpasses, in  the judgment of every one, all other Christian princes.\"  But Charles of  Austria did not consider himself beaten because two of the seven electors  displayed avarice and venality.  His aunt Margaret and his principal  agent in Germany, the Chamberlain Armerstoff, resumed financial  negotiations with the Archbishop of Mayence, for his brother the margrave  as well as for himself, and the archbishop, without any formal  engagement, accepted the Austrian over-bid.  \"I am ashamed at his  shamelessness,\" wrote Armerstorff to Charles.  Alternate and antagonistic  bargaining went on thus for more than two months.  The Archbishop of  Cologne, Hermann von Wied, kept wavering between the two claimants; but  he was careful to tell John d'Albret, Francis I.'s agent, that \"he  sincerely hoped that his Majesty would follow the doctrine of God, who  gave as much to those who went to work in His vineyard towards the middle  of the day as to those who had been at it all the morning.\"  Duke  Frederick of Saxony was the only one of the seven electors who absolutely  refused to make any promise, as well as to accept any offer, and  preserved his independence, as well as his dignity.  The rumor of all  these traffickings and these uncertainties rekindled in Henry VIII., King  of England, a fancy for placing himself once more in the ranks; but his  agent, Richard Pace, found the negotiations too far advanced and the  prices too high for him to back up this vain whim of his master's; and  Henry VIII. abandoned it.  The diet had been convoked for the 17th of  June at Frankfort.  The day was drawing near; and which of the two  parties had the majority was still regarded as, uncertain.  Franz von  Sickingen appeared in the outskirts of Frankfort with more than twenty  thousand men of the German army, \"whereat marvellously astonished,\" says  Fleuranges, \"were they who wished well to the King of France and very  mightily rejoiced they who wished well to the Catholic king.\"  The gentleman-adventurer had not been less accessible than the  prince-electors to bribery.  The diet opened on the 18th of June.  The  Archbishop of Mayence made a great speech in favor of Charles of Austria;  and the Archbishop of Troves spoke in favor of Francis I., to whom he had  remained faithful.  Rival intrigues were kept up; Sickingen and his  troops were a clog upon deliberation; the electors were embarrassed and  weary of their dissensions; and the Archbishop of Troves proposed by way  of compromise the election of the Duke of Saxony, Frederick the Wise,  who, at this crisis so shameful for his peers, had just given fresh  proofs of his sound judgment, his honesty, and his patriotic  independence.  But Frederick declined the honor it was intended to do  him, and which he considered beyond his powers to support; and he voted  for Archduke Charles, \"a real German prince,\" said he, \"the choice of  whom seemed to him most natural in point of right and most suitable in  point of fact under the present circumstances of Europe.\"  The six other  electors gave in to his opinion, and that same day, June 18, 1519,  unanimously elected the King of Spain, Charles, King of the Romans and  Emperor of Germany, with the title of Charles V.    [Illustration: Charles V----39]    Whatever pains were taken by Francis I. to keep up a good appearance  after this heavy reverse, his mortification was profound, and he thought  of nothing but getting his revenge.  He flattered himself he would find  something of the sort in a solemn interview and an appearance of alliance  with Henry VIII., King of England, who had, like himself, just undergone  in the election to the empire a less flagrant but an analogous reverse.  It had already, in the previous year and on the occasion of a treaty  concluded between the two kings for the restitution of Tournai to France,  been settled that they should meet before long in token of  reconciliation.  Allusion had even been made, at that period, to a much  more important restitution, of Calais in fact, for which Francis I., at  what price we know not, had obtained the advocacy of Cardinal Wolsey, who  was then all-powerful with Henry VIII.  \"Of what use to Us,\" Wolsey had  said, \"is this town of Calais, where in time of peace as well as of war  we have to keep up such numerous garrisons, which costs us so much money,  and which so often forces us to measures contrary to the real interests  of England?\"  But this idea was vehemently scouted by the English, and  the coming interview between the two kings remained the sole accessory of  the treaty of 1518.  After Charles V.'s election to the empire, Francis  I. was eager to claim this interview, which was sure to cause in Europe  the impression of a close understanding between the two kings before the  very eyes of their common rival.  A convention, signed on the 26th of  March, 1520, regulated its details.  It was stipulated that the two kings  should meet in Picardy between Guines, an English possession in the  neighborhood of Calais, and Ardres, which belonged to France.  But, so  soon as Charles V., at that time in Spain, was informed of this design,  he used all his efforts to make it abortive.  Henry, however, stood firm;  not that he had resolved to knit himself closely with Francis I. against  the new emperor, whom, a few months previously, he had shown alacrity in  felicitating upon his accession to the empire, but he was unwilling to  fail in his promise to the King of France, and he liked to assume in  respect of the two rivals the part of an arbiter equally courted by both.  Charles V., still actively working against the interview, entered into  secret negotiation with Cardinal Wolsey to obtain for himself also an  interview with Henry VIII., which would destroy the effect of that in  course of arrangement between the Kings of France and England.  In  writing to Wolsey he called him his \"very dear friend,\" and guaranteed  him a pension of seven thousand ducats, secured upon two Spanish  bishoprics; and on the 26th of May, 1520, Henry"]]]
