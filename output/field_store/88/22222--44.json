She had been working in various ways ever since six  o'clock that morning, and the darning of the boys' rough socks hurt her  eyes and made her fingers ache.    Meanwhile Kathleen was running along the road. She ran until she was  completely out of breath. She then came to a stile, against which she  leant. By-and-by she saw a girl walking leisurely up the road; she was a  shabbily dressed and rather vulgar girl. Kathleen saw at once that she  was one of the Great Shirley girls, so she went forward and spoke to  her.    \"You go to our school, don't you?\" she said.    \"Yes, miss,\" answered the girl, dropping a little curtsy when she saw  Kathleen. She was a very fresh foundation girl, and recognized something  in Kathleen which caused her to be more subservient than was necessary.    \"Then, if you please,\" continued Kathleen, \"can you tell me where that  sweetly pretty girl, Ruth Craven, lives?\"    \"She isn't a lady,\" said the girl, whose name was Susan Hopkins. \"She is  no more a lady than I am.\"    \"Indeed she is,\" said Kathleen. \"She is a great deal more of a lady than  you are.\"    The girl flushed.    \"You are a Great Shirley girl yourself,\" she said. \"I saw you there  to-day. You are in an awfully low class. Do you like sitting with the  little kids? I saw you towering up in the middle of them like a  mountain.\"    Kathleen's eyes flashed.    \"What is your name?\" she asked.    \"Susan Hopkins. I used to be a Board School girl, but now I am on the  foundation at Great Shirley. It is a big rise for me. Are you a poor  girl? Are you on the foundation?\"    \"I don't know what it means by being on the foundation, but I don't  think I am poor. I think, on the contrary, that I am very rich. Did you  ever hear of a girl who lived in a castle--a great beautiful castle--on  the top of a high hill? If you ever did, I am that girl.\"    \"Oh, my!\" said Susy Hopkins. \"That does sound romantic.\"    Her momentary dislike to Kathleen had vanished. The desire to go to the  town on a message for her mother had completely left her. She stood  still, as though fascinated.    \"I live there,\" said Kathleen--\"that is, I do when I am at home. I come  from the land of the mountain and the stream; of the shamrock; of the  deep, deep blue sea.\"    \"Ireland? Are you Irish?\" said the girl.    \"I am proud to say that I am.\"    \"We don't think anything of the Irish here.\"    \"Oh, don't you?\"    \"But don't be angry, please,\" continued Susy, \"for I am sure you are  very nice.\"    \"I am nice when I like. To-day I am nasty. I am wicked to-day--quite  wicked; I could hate any one who opposes me. I want some one to help me;  if some one will help me, I will be nice to that person. Will you?\"    \"Oh, my word, yes! How handsome you look when you flash your eyes!\"  said Susy Hopkins.    \"Then I want to find that dear little girl, who is so beautiful that I  love her and can't get her out of my head. I want to find Ruth Craven.  She went away with a horrid, stiff, pokery girl called Cassandra Weldon.  You have such strange names in your country. That horrid, prim Cassandra  chose to correct me when I came into school, and she has taken my  darling away--the only one I love in the whole of England. I want to  find her. I will give you--- I will give you an Irish diamond set in a  brooch if you will help me.\"    This sounded a very grand offer indeed to Susy Hopkins, who lived in the  most modest way, and had not a jewel of any sort in her possession.    \"I will help you. I will, and I can. I know where Miss Weldon lives. I  can take you to her house.\"    \"But I want Ruth.\"    \"If she has taken Ruth home, she will be at Cassandra's house,\" said  Susy.    \"And you can take me there?\"    \"This blessed minute.\"    \"All right; come along.\"    \"When will you give me the diamond set in the brooch?\"    \"It isn't a real diamond, you know. It is an Irish diamond set in  silver--real silver. My old nurse had it made for me, and I wear it  sometimes. I will bring it to you to school to-morrow.\"    \"Oh, thank you--thank you, Miss--I forgot your name.\"    \"O'Hara--Kathleen O'Hara.\"    \"O'Hara is rather a difficult name to say. May I call you Kathleen?\"    \"Just as you please, Susan. It is more handy for me to say Susan than  Hopkins. As long as I am in England I must consort, I see, with all  kinds of people; and if you will make yourself useful to me, I will be  good to you.\"    Susy turned and led the way in the direction of Cassandra Weldon's home.  They had to walk across a very wide field, then down a narrow lane, then  up a steep hill, and then into a valley. At the bottom of the valley was  a straight road, and at each side of the road were neat little  houses--small and very proper-looking. Each house consisted of two  stories, with a hall door in the middle and a sitting room on each side.  There were three windows overhead, and one or two attics in the roof.  The houses were very compact; they were new, and were called by  ambitious names. For instance, the house where the Weldons lived went by  the ambitious name of Sans Souci. All through the walk Susy chatted for  the benefit of her companion. She told Kathleen so much about her life  that she was interested in spite of herself! and by the time they  arrived outside Sans Souci, Kathleen's hand was lying affectionately on  her companion's arm.    \"I had best not go in, miss,\" she said. \"Cassandra Weldon would never  take the very least notice of me; and none of us foundation girls like  her at all.\"    \"Well, it is extremely unfair,\" said Kathleen. \"From all you have been  telling me, the foundation girls must be particularly clever. I tell you  what it is: I think I shall take to you.\"    \"Oh, would you, indeed, miss?\" said Susy, her eyes sparkling. \"There are  a hundred of us, you know, in the school.\"    \"That is a great number. And Ruth Craven is really one?\"    \"She is, miss. She isn't a bit better than the rest of us.\"    \"And I love her already.\"    \"She is no better than the rest of us,\" repeated Susan Hopkins.    \"I have a great mind to take to you all, to make a fuss about you, and  to show the others how badly they behave.\"    \"You'd be a queen amongst us; there's no doubt about that.\"    \"It would be lovely, and it would be a tremendous bit of naughtiness,\"  thought Kathleen.    \"Do you think you will, miss? Because, if you do, I will tell the  others. We could meet you and talk over things.\"    \"Well, I will decide to-morrow. I will enclose a letter with your  brooch. Good-bye now; I must go in and kiss my darling Ruth.\"    Susy Hopkins stood for a minute to watch Kathleen as she went up the  little narrow path of Sans Souci. When Kathleen reached the porch she  waved her hand, and Susy, putting wings to her feet, ran as fast as she  could in the opposite direction. She felt very much elated and really  pleased. In the whole course of her life she had never met a girl of the  Kathleen O'Hara type before. Her beauty, her daring and wild manner, the  flash in her bright dark eyes, the glints of gold in her lovely hair,  all fascinated Susy.    \"What a queen she'd make!\" she thought. \"We must make her our queen.  We'd have quite a party of our own in the school if she took us up. And  she will; I'm sure she will. This is a lark. This is worth a great  deal.\"    Meanwhile Kathleen rang the bell at Sans Souci in a very smart,  imperative manner. A little maid, neatly dressed, came to the door.    \"Please,\" said Kathleen, \"will you say that Miss O'Hara has called and  would be glad to see Miss Ruth Craven for a few minutes?\"    The girl withdrew. Presently she returned.    \"Mrs. Weldon will be pleased if you will go in, miss. She is sitting in  the drawing-room. The two young ladies are out in the garden.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Kathleen.    After a brief hesitation she entered the house, and was conducted across  the narrow hall into a very sweet and charmingly furnished room. The  room had a bay-window with French doors; these opened on to a little  flower-lawn. At one side of the house was a tiny conservatory full of  bright flowers. Compared to the house where the Tennants lived, this  tiny place looked like a paradise to Kathleen. She gave a quick glance  round her, then came up to Mrs. Weldon.    \"I am one of the new girls at the Great Shirley School,\" she said. \"My  name is Kathleen O'Hara. I am Irish. I have only just crossed the cold  sea. I am lonely, too. I want Ruth Craven. May I sit down a minute while  your servant fetches her? I like Ruth Craven. She is very pretty, isn't  she? She is the sort of girl that you'd take a fancy to when you're  lonely and far from home. May I sit here until she comes?\"    \"Of course, my dear,\" said Mrs. Weldon, speaking with kindness, and  looking with eyes full of interest at the handsome, striking-looking  girl. \"I quite understand your being lonely. I was very lonely indeed  when I came home from India and left my dear father and mother behind  me.\"    \"How old were you when you came home?\"    \"A great deal younger than you are: only seven years old. But that is a  long time ago. I should like to be kind to you, Miss O'Hara. Cassandra  has been telling me about you. You are living at the Tennants', are you  not? Alice Tennant and Cassandra are great friends.\"    \"But I don't like either of them,\" said Kathleen in her blunt way.    Mrs. Weldon looked a little startled.    \"Do you know my daughter?\" she asked.    \"She is much too interfering, and she is frightfully stuck-up. Please  forgive me, but I am always very plain-spoken; I always tell the truth.  I don't want her. I like you, and wish that I lived with you, and that  you'd have Ruth Craven instead of your own daughter in the house. Then  I'd be perfectly happy. I always did say what I thought. Will you  forgive me?\"    \"I will, dear, because at the present moment you don't know my girl at  all.

And do you think, he asked who was in  command of the 'Legion of the West.' I told him it was a very gallant  officer named Grant, and that, by our last news, he was about to  establish his head-quarters at Vicksburg. Then, 'Where was Vicksburg?' I  worked that out on the map; it was about a hundred miles, more or less,  above his old Fort Adams; and I thought Fort Adams must he a ruin now.  'It must be at old Vick's plantation,' at Walnut Hills, said he: 'well,  that is a change!'    \"I tell you, Ingham, it was a hard thing to condense the history of half  a century into that talk with a sick man. And I do not now know what I  told him,--of emigration, and the means of it,--of steamboats, and  railroads, and telegraphs,--of inventions, and books, and  literature,--of the colleges, and West Point, and the Naval School,--but  with the queerest interruptions that ever you heard. You see it was  Robinson Crusoe asking all the accumulated questions of fifty-six  years!    \"I remember he asked, all of a sudden, who was President now; and when I  told him, he asked if Old Abe was General Benjamin Lincoln's son. He  said he met old General Lincoln, when he was quite a boy himself, at  some Indian treaty. I said no, that Old Abe was a Kentuckian like  himself, but I could not tell him of what family; he had worked up from  the ranks. 'Good for him!' cried Nolan; 'I am glad of that. As I have  brooded and wondered, I have thought our danger was in keeping up those  regular successions in the first families.' Then I got talking about my  visit to Washington. I told him of meeting the Oregon Congressman,  Harding; I told him about the Smithsonian, and the Exploring Expedition;  I told him about the Capitol, and the statues for the pediment, and  Crawford's Liberty, and Greenough's Washington: Ingham, I told him  everything I could think of that would show the grandeur of his country  and its prosperity; but I could not make up my mouth to tell him a word  about this infernal Rebellion!    \"And he drank it in, and enjoyed it as I cannot tell you. He grew more  and more silent, yet I never thought he was tired or faint. I gave him a  glass of water, but he just wet his lips, and told me not to go away.  Then he asked me to bring the Presbyterian 'Book of Public Prayer,'  which lay there, and said, with a smile, that it would open at the right  place,--and so it did. There was his double red mark down the page; and  I knelt down and read, and he repeated with me, 'For ourselves and our  country, O gracious God, we thank Thee, that, notwithstanding our  manifold transgressions of Thy holy laws, Thou hast continued to us Thy  marvellous kindness,'--and so to the end of that thanksgiving. Then he  turned to the end of the same book, and I read the words more familiar  to me: 'Most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold and bless  Thy servant, the President of the United States, and all others in  authority,'--and the rest of the Episcopal collect. 'Danforth,' said he,  'I have repeated those prayers night and morning, it is now fifty-five  years.' And then he said he would go to sleep. He bent me down over him  and kissed me; and he said, 'Look in my Bible, Danforth, when I am  gone.' And I went away.    \"But I had no thought it was the end. I thought he was tired and would  sleep. I knew he was happy and I wanted him to be alone.    \"But in an hour, when the doctor went in gently he found Nolan had  breathed his life away with a smile. He had something pressed close to  his lips. It was his father's badge of the Order of the Cincinnati.    \"We looked in his Bible, and there was a slip of paper at the place  where he had marked the text:--    \"'They desire a country, even a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed  to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.'    \"On this slip of paper he had written:--    \"'Bury me in the sea; it has been my home, and I love it. But will not  some one set up a stone for my memory at Fort Adams or at Orleans, that  my disgrace may not be more than I ought to bear? Say on it:--        \"'_In Memory of_        PHILIP NOLAN,        _Lieutenant in the Army of the United States_, He loved his      country as no other man has loved her; but no man deserved less at      her hands.'\"          THE LAST OF THE FLORIDA.    FROM THE INGHAM PAPERS.      [The Florida, Anglo-Rebel pirate, after inflicting horrible injuries on  the commerce of America and the good name of England, was cut out by  Captain Collins, from the bay of Bahia, by one of those fortunate  mistakes in international law which endear brave men to the nations in  whose interest they are committed. When she arrived here the government  was obliged to disavow the act. The question then was, as we had her by  mistake, what we should do with her. At that moment the National  Sailors' Fair was in full blast at Boston, and I offered my suggestion  in answer in the following article, which was published November 19,  1864, in the \"Boatswain's Whistle,\" a little paper issued at the fair.    The government did not take the suggestion. Very unfortunately, before  the Florida was got ready for sea, she was accidentally sunk in a  collision with a tug off Fort Monroe, and the heirs of the Confederate  government or the English bond-holders must look there for her, if the  Brazilian government will give them permission.    For the benefit of the New York Observer I will state that a despatch  sent round the world in a spiral direction westward 1,200 times, would  not really arrive at its destination four years before it started. It is  only a joke which suggests it.]           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIAL DESPATCH.    LETTER FROM CAPTAIN INGHAM, IN COMMAND OF THE FLORIDA.    [Received four years in advance of the mail by a lightning express,  which has gained that time by running round the world 1,200 times in a  spiral direction westward on its way from Brazil to our  publication-office. Mrs. Ingham's address not being known, the letter is  printed for her information.]    No. 29.    BAHIA, BRAZIL, April 1, 1868.    MY DEAR WIFE:--We are here at last, thank fortune; and I shall surrender  the old pirate to-day to the officers of government. We have been  saluted, are to be feted, and perhaps I shall be made a Knight Commander  of the Golden Goose. I never was so glad as when I saw the lights on the  San Esperitu head-land, which makes the south point of this Bahia or  bay.    You will not have received my No. 28 from Loando, and may have missed 26  and 24, which I gave to _outward_ bound whalemen. I always doubted  whether you got 1, 7, 9, and 11. And for me I have no word of you since  you waved your handkerchief from the window in Springfield Street on the  morning of the 1st of June, 1865, nearly four years. My dear child, you  will not know me.    Let me then repeat, very briefly, the outline of this strange cruise;  and when the letters come, you can fill in the blanks.    The government had determined that the Florida must be returned to the  neutral harbor whence she came. They had put her in complete repair, and  six months of diplomacy had made the proper apologies to the Brazilian  government. Meanwhile Collins, who had captured her by mistake, had, by  another mistake, been made an admiral, and was commanding a squadron;  and to insure her safe and respectful delivery, I, who had been waiting  service, was un shelved, and, as you know, bidden to take command.    She was in apple-pie order. The engines had been cleaned up; and I  thought we could make a quick thing of it. I was a little dashed when I  found the crew was small; but I have been glad enough since that we had  no more mouths. No one but myself knew our destination. The men thought  we were to take despatches to the Gulf squadron.    You remember I had had only verbal orders to take command, and after we  got outside the bay I opened my sealed despatches. The gist of them was  in these words:--    \"You will understand that the honor of this government is pledged for  the _safe_ delivery of the Florida to the government of Brazil. You will  therefore hazard nothing to gain speed. The quantity of your coal has  been adjusted with the view to give your vessel her best trim, and the  supply is not large. You will husband it with care,--taking every  precaution to arrive in Bahia _safely_ with your charge, in such time as  _your best discretion_ may suggest to you.\"    \"_Your best discretion_\" was underscored.    I called Prendergast, and showed him the letter. Then we called the  engineer and asked about the coal. He had not been into the bunkers, but  went and returned with his face white, through the black grime, to  report \"not four days' consumption.\" By some cursed accident, he said,  the bunkers had been filled with barrels of salt-pork and flour!    On this, I ordered a light and went below. There had been some fatal  misunderstanding somewhere. The vessel was fitted out as for an arctic  voyage. Everywhere hard-bread, flour, pork, beef, vinegar, sour-krout;  but, clearly enough, not, at the very best, five days of coal!    And I was to get to Brazil with this old pirate transformed into a  provision ship, \"at my best discretion.\"    \"Prendergast,\" said I, \"we will take it easy. Were you ever in Bahia?\"    \"Took flour there in '55, and lay waiting for India-rubber from July to  October. Lost six men by yellow-jack.\"    Prendergast was from the merchant marine. I had known him since we were  children. \"Ethan,\" said I, \"in my best discretion it would be bad to  arrive there before the end of October. Where would you go?\"    I cannot say he took the responsibility. He would not take it. You know,  my dear, of course, that it was I who suggested Upernavik.
