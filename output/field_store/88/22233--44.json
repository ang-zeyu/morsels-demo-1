Influenced by these reasons I  desired all hands to prepare to start in search of Stiles.    Strange however to say, my resolution was scarcely made known ere much  grumbling arose; and this chiefly amongst those men who had lately been  loudest in their praises of the system of only marching a few miles a day  and occasionally halting for a day or two where we could get native roots  to eat, in fact, amongst those whose foolish ideas had led Stiles to  desert the party. We however moved on in the direction of the spot where  Kaiber had lost the tracks, and on our way over the high ground we met a  native with his spear and a handful of fish; he was lost in thought and  we were close to him before he saw us: when he did so he took no notice  whatever of us, but without even quickening his pace continued in his  original line of direction, which crossed ours obliquely. As he evidently  did not wish to communicate with us I directed the men not to take the  least notice of him, and thus we passed one another. He must have been a  very brave fellow to act so coolly as he did when an array so strange to  him met his eye.    ANOTHER PARTY OF NATIVES.    On arriving at the beach to the south of a bay or harbour,* which the  pressure of circumstances precluded me from examining, we could find  nothing of Stiles's tracks: he appeared to have gone off due east in the  hope of crossing our route, but, being in advance of us, and consequently  not finding our traces, it was impossible to say in which direction he  might have turned. The natives now mustered a very large force and  occupied the high hills (almost cliffs) which lay a few hundred yards to  our left, and, as they had such an advantageous position and could at any  moment surprise us amongst the low sandhills where we were searching for  Stiles's footsteps, our situation was one of great danger. At length,  finding it impossible to keep the men steady, I moved them up to the  higher ground, where we could have met the natives upon a footing of  equality. They appeared, although very numerous, to be now by no means  hostile, merely standing on a high hill, watching us and calling out  \"Yoongar kaw,\" or \"Oh, people!\" whilst Kaiber, who knew nothing of their  vile magical practices, and therefore regarded them as mere ordinary  flesh and blood, was very ready to communicate with them; but as they  made no other advances, I thought it better merely to remain near them  for the night, occasionally firing a gun in hopes Stiles might hear it,  and with this intention I selected a spot for our encampment.    (*Footnote. For a further description of this harbour, which has been  since denominated Port Grey, see the account of the schooner Champion's  Expedition in the 6th chapter.)    April 8.    We started very early this morning and Kaiber exerted himself to the  utmost to find Stiles's traces. At the end of three miles, on a course of  180 degrees, we descended from the elevated scrubby plains we had been  moving along to the lowlands, and on reaching this came upon the bed of a  small watercourse. I here halted the party; and as it was uncertain when  we might again fall in with water I commenced a search for it with  Kaiber, but after travelling rapidly over a good deal of ground without  seeing either water or any traces of Stiles we rejoined the party very  much fatigued.    THE MAN FOUND.    For the next two and a half miles we wound along low, grassy, swampy  plains, thinly wooded with clumps of Acacias, and then entered upon low  scrubby plains bounding the sea-shore. I here caught sight of Stiles just  ahead of us and coming in from the eastward: he was very glad once more  to find himself in safety; and his comrades seemed pleased to see him  again, although many a suppressed murmur had met my ears during our  morning's walk at the trouble I was taking to look for him.    THE GREENOUGH RIVER.    Four miles further over similar plains in a south by east direction  brought us to a river, about five-and-twenty yards wide, which I named  the Greenough; and travelling up it a short distance we found a spot  where we could cross by stepping from rock to rock. Its waters were quite  salt. I continued our route for about three miles, when I found it was  impossible to induce some of the men to walk any further; they laid  sullenly down and were so fully convinced that I was pursuing a wrong  system in marching so far in a day, and never halting for two or three  days to refresh, as they wished, that I could do nothing with them, and  was therefore forced to sit down too. Corporal Auger soon afterwards  found water near us, and I moved the party down to it.    Finding water in some degree revived their spirits and I contrived to get  them to proceed seven miles more before nightfall, the way being over  sandy open plains very favourable for walking.    MORE NATIVE HUTS.    We passed a large assemblage of native huts of the same permanent  character as those I have before mentioned: there were two groups of  those houses close together in a sequestered nook in a wood, which taken  collectively would have contained at least a hundred and fifty natives.  We halted for the night in the dry bed of a watercourse, abounding in  grass, so that we again enjoyed the luxury of a soft bed. At first I  thought that we were near natives from hearing a plaintive cry like that  of a child, but Kaiber assured me that it was the cry of the young of the  wild turkey.    CROSS THE HEADS OF TWO BAYS.    In the course of this day we travelled across the heads of two bays,  which were indistinctly visible through the woods.    FERTILE VALLEY.    April 9.    The first three miles of our route this day lay over sandy scrubby  plains; we saw however a good country to the eastward. I found that a man  of the name of Charley Woods was much knocked up; he was a supporter of  the eight or nine miles a day system, and had a very heavy load with no  portion of which could I induce him to part; he however insisted on  sitting down every half mile and detaining the party, and as I found that  they got more worn out and weaker, and the impression in favour of long  rests and short marches became much stronger, I thought it more prudent  to acquiesce for the present.    We now reached a very thick belt of trees, pushing through which was a  task of great difficulty, but at length we emerged upon some clear hills  overlooking a very extensive and fertile valley, from which arose so  dense a fog that portions of it appeared to be a large lake. Into this  valley we descended, and the remainder of the day until near noon was  spent by me in endeavouring to get the men to move.    THE IRWIN RIVER. AUSTRALIND.    We this morning for the first time met with Zamia trees, and about 12  P.M. came down upon the large sandy bed of a dried up river which I named  the Irwin after my friend Major Irwin, the Commandant at Swan River;  following this for half a mile we found a native well, dug to a  considerable depth in the bed, but all our scraping here was vain. Water  was found at a great depth, but so shallow that we could not dip it up.  Some of the men saw four native boys playing in the grassy plains near  us; directly however the little fellows perceived us, they scampered off  at their utmost speed, and no doubt ever since that period they have been  firm believers in the existence of ghosts.    The men now began to complain much of the want of water, and I for some  time followed the traces of these native boys, who had come from the  southward and eastward, in the hope that their tracks would lead us to  it, but the grumbling and discontent of some of the men was so great that  I found it almost impossible to induce them to move. My object was to get  them to walk to a high peaked hill distant about five miles from us in a  due south-east direction, and under which I felt certain, from its  height, that we should find water, but I was obliged at last to give up  this idea: Charles Woods would not stir at all, and several of the men  followed his example; they laid down on the ground and no inducement  could prevail on them either to move or to abandon a portion of their  loads; and this obstinacy on their part was accompanied in some instances  with the most blasphemous and horrid expressions. Indeed I could not  conceal from myself the fact of its being the general impression that my  mode of proceeding was \"killing the men,\" and that consequently some of  them had arrived at the resolution of compelling me by their conduct to  adopt their favourite system of short marches and long halts. But I was  still aware of the disastrous consequences which must necessarily result  from such a mode of proceeding, and determined to have nothing to do with  it.    In the course of the afternoon I managed to get the party to move about a  mile and a half in an easterly direction, but they here again sat down  and could neither be induced to walk or to part with their bundles.    SEARCH FOR WATER.    As they had not tasted water today I selected the best walkers, namely,  Corporals Auger and Coles, Hackney, Henry Woods, and Kaiber, and went off  to look for some to bring to the rest. We were now on a well-beaten  native path which traversed a fertile tract of country, and along this we  continued our route, walking as rapidly as we could, for night was coming  on apace. From this path we made frequent divergencies but found no  water; in one instance we met with a native well of great depth, where a  party of them had been drinking a few days before, but it was now quite  dry.    FIND IT AT WATER PEAK. WATER PEAK HILL.    We therefore continued our search, and just as it was growing dark had  made"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#7)"],[1,"the ground raked into  the small squares for irrigation which the prehistoric farmer made; and  the plough is shaped as it always was. The _shadoof_, or water-hoist,  is patiently worked as it has been for thousands of years; while the  cylindrical hoist employed in Lower Egypt was invented and introduced in  Ptolemaic times. Threshing and winnowing proceed in the manner  represented on the monuments, and the methods of sowing and reaping have  not changed. Along the embanked roads, men, cattle, and donkeys file  past against the sky-line, recalling the straight rows of such figures  depicted so often upon the monuments. Overhead there flies the vulture  goddess Nekheb, and the hawk Horus hovers near by. Across the road ahead  slinks the jackal, Anubis; under one's feet crawls Khepera, the scarab;  and there, under the sacred tree, sleeps the horned ram of Amon. In all  directions the hieroglyphs of the ancient Egyptians pass to and fro, as  though some old temple-inscription had come to life. The letter _m_, the  owl, goes hooting past. The letter _a_, the eagle, circles overhead; the  sign _ur_, the wagtail, flits at the roadside, chirping at the sign  _rekh_, the peewit. Along the road comes the sign _ab_, the frolicking  calf; and near it is _ka_, the bull; while behind them walks the sign  _fa_, a man carrying a basket on his head. In all directions are the  figures from which the ancients made their hieroglyphical script; and  thus that wonderful old writing at once ceases to be mysterious, a thing  of long ago, and one realises how natural a product of the country it  was.      [Illustration: PL. IV. In the palm-groves near Sakkara, Egypt.]                           [_Photo by E. Bird._    In a word, ancient and modern Egyptians are fundamentally similar. Nor  is there any great difference to be observed between the country's  relations with foreign powers in ancient days and those of the last  hundred years. As has been seen in the last chapter, Egypt was usually  occupied by a foreign power, or ruled by a foreign dynasty, just as at  the present day; and a foreign army was retained in the country during  most of the later periods of ancient history. There were always numerous  foreigners settled in Egypt, and in Ptolemaic and Roman times Alexandria  and Memphis swarmed with them. The great powers of the civilised world  were always watching Egypt as they do now, not always in a friendly  attitude to that one of themselves which occupied the country; and the  chief power with which Egypt was concerned in the time of the Ramesside  Pharaohs inhabited Asia Minor and perhaps Turkey, just as in the middle  ages and the last century. Then, as in modern times, Egypt had much of  her attention held by the Sudan, and constant expeditions had to be made  into the regions above the cataracts. Thus it cannot be argued that  ancient history offers no precedent for modern affairs because all  things have now changed. Things have changed extremely little, broadly  speaking; and general lines of conduct have the same significance at the  present time as they had in the past.    I wish now to give an outline of Egypt's relationship to her most  important neighbour, Syria, in order that the bearing of history upon  modern political matters may be demonstrated; for it would seem that the  records of the past make clear a tendency which is now somewhat  overlooked. I employ this subject simply as an example.    From the earliest historical times the Egyptians have endeavoured to  hold Syria and Palestine as a vassal state. One of the first Pharaohs  with whom we meet in Egyptian history, King Zeser of Dynasty III., is  known to have sent a fleet to the Lebanon in order to procure cedar  wood, and there is some evidence to show that he held sway over this  country. For how many centuries previous to his reign the Pharaohs had  overrun Syria we cannot now say, but there is no reason to suppose that  Zeser initiated the aggressive policy of Egypt in Asia. Sahura, a  Pharaoh of Dynasty V., attacked the Phoenician coast with his fleet, and  returned to the Nile Valley with a number of Syrian captives. Pepi I. of  the succeeding dynasty also attacked the coast-cities, and Pepi II. had  considerable intercourse with Asia. Amenemhat I., of Dynasty XII.,  fought in Syria, and appears to have brought it once more under Egyptian  sway. Senusert I. seems to have controlled the country to some extent,  for Egyptians lived there in some numbers. Senusert III. won a great  victory over the Asiatics in Syria; and a stela and statue belonging to  Egyptian officials have been found at Gezer, between Jerusalem and the  sea. After each of the above-mentioned wars it is to be presumed that  the Egyptians held Syria for some years, though little is now known of  the events of these far-off times.    During the Hyksos dynasties in Egypt there lived a Pharaoh named Khyan  who was of Semitic extraction; and there is some reason to suppose that  he ruled from Baghdad to the Sudan, he and his fathers having created a  great Egyptian Empire by the aid of foreign troops. Egypt's connection  with Asia during the Hyksos rule is not clearly defined, but the very  fact that these foreign kings were anxious to call themselves \"Pharaohs\"  shows that Egypt dominated in the east end of the Mediterranean. The  Hyksos kings of Egypt very probably held Syria in fee, being possessed  of both countries, but preferring to hold their court in Egypt.    We now come to the great Dynasty XVIII., and we learn more fully of the  Egyptian invasions of Syria. Ahmosis I. drove the Hyksos out of the  Delta and pursued them through Judah. His successor, Amenhotep I.,  appears to have seized all the country as far as the Euphrates; and  Thutmosis I., his son, was able to boast that he ruled even unto that  river. Thutmosis III., Egypt's greatest Pharaoh, led invasion after  invasion into Syria, so that his name for generations was a terror to  the inhabitants. From the Euphrates to the fourth cataract of the Nile  the countries acknowledged him king, and the mighty Egyptian fleet  patrolled the seas. This Pharaoh fought no less than seventeen campaigns  in Asia, and he left to his son the most powerful throne in the world.  Amenhotep II. maintained this empire and quelled the revolts of the  Asiatics with a strong hand. Thutmosis IV., his son, conducted two  expeditions into Syria; and the next king, Amenhotep III., was  acknowledged throughout that country.    That extraordinary dreamer, Akhnaton, the succeeding Pharaoh, allowed  the empire to pass from him owing to his religious objections to war;  but, after his death, Tutankhamen once more led the Egyptian armies into  Asia. Horemheb also made a bid for Syria; and Seti I. recovered  Palestine. Rameses II., his son, penetrated to North Syria; but, having  come into contact with the new power of the Hittites, he was unable to  hold the country. The new Pharaoh, Merenptah, seized Canaan and laid  waste the land of Israel. A few years later, Rameses III. led his fleet  and his army to the Syrian coast and defeated the Asiatics in a great  sea-battle. He failed to hold the country, however, and after his death  Egypt remained impotent for two centuries. Then, under Sheshonk I., of  Dynasty XXII., a new attempt was made, and Jerusalem was captured.  Takeloth II., of the same dynasty, sent thither an Egyptian army to help  in the overthrow of Shalmaneser II.    From this time onwards the power of Egypt had so much declined that the  invasions into Syria of necessity became more rare. Shabaka of Dynasty  XXV. concerned himself deeply with Asiatic politics, and attempted to  bring about a state of affairs which would have given him the  opportunity of seizing the country. Pharaoh Necho, of the succeeding  dynasty, invaded Palestine and advanced towards the Euphrates. He  recovered for Egypt her Syrian province, but it was speedily lost again.  Apries, a few years later, captured the Phoenician coast and invaded  Palestine; but the country did not remain for long under Egyptian rule.  It is not necessary to record all the Syrian wars of the Dynasty of the  Ptolemies. Egypt and Asia were now closely connected, and at several  periods during this phase of Egyptian history the Asiatic province came  under the control of the Pharaohs. The wars of Ptolemy I. in Syria were  conducted on a large scale. In the reign of Ptolemy III. there were  three campaigns, and I cannot refrain from quoting a contemporary record  of the King's powers if only for the splendour of its wording:--    \"The great King Ptolemy ... having inherited from his father the royalty  of Egypt and Libya and Syria and Phoenicia and Cyprus and Lycia and  Caria and the Cyclades, set out on a campaign into Asia with infantry  and cavalry forces, a naval armament and elephants, both Troglodyte and  Ethiopic.... But having become master of all the country within the  Euphrates, and of Cilicia and Pamphylia and Ionia and the Hellespont  and Thrace, and of all the military forces and elephants in these  countries, and having made the monarchs in all these places his  subjects, he crossed the Euphrates, and having brought under him  Mesopotamia and Babylonia and Susiana and Persis and Media, and all the  rest as far as Bactriana ... he sent forces through the canals----\"  (Here the text breaks off.)    Later in this dynasty Ptolemy VII. was crowned King of Syria, but the  kingdom did not remain long in his power. Then came the Romans, and for  many years Syria and Egypt were sister provinces of one empire.    There is no necessity to record the close connection between the two  countries in Arabic times. For a large part of that era Egypt and Syria  formed part of the same empire; and we constantly find Egyptians  fighting in Asia. Now, under Edh Dhahir Bebars of the Baharide Mameluke  Dynasty, we see them helping to subject Syria and Armenia; now, under  El-Mansur Kalaun,"]]]
