[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#7)"],[1,"made by the German Imperial Chancellor to the Reichstag  on Aug. 4, which we published yesterday and reproduce below, lends  piquancy to a communication that reached us from an influential quarter  in Germany on Aug. 2. The communication, which we give in its original  form, bore the name of a personage holding a prominent position in  Germany, and standing in a close personal relationship to the German  Emperor. It was evidently timed for publication on the morning of Aug.  3, the day of Sir Edward Grey's historic speech in the House of  Commons\":         Aug. 2, 1914.         I hear with astonishment that in France and elsewhere in the world       it is imagined that Germany wants to carry on an aggressive war,       and that she had with this aim brought about the present situation.       It is said that the Emperor was of the opinion that the moment had       come to have a final reckoning with his enemies; but what a       terrible error that is! Whoever knows the Emperor as I do, whoever       knows how very seriously he takes the responsibility of the crown,       how his moral ideas are rooted in true religious feeling, must be       astonished that any one could attribute such motives to him.         He has not wanted the war; it has been forced upon him by the might       of the circumstances. He has worked unswervingly to keep the peace,       and has together with England thrown his whole influence into the       scales to find a peaceful solution, in order to save his people       from the horrors of war. But everything has been wrecked upon the       attitude of Russia, which in the middle of negotiations which       offered good outlook of success mobilized her forces, wherewith she       proved that she did not mean in earnest what her assurances of       peaceful intentions indicated.         Now Germany's frontiers are menaced by Russia which drags her       allies into the war, now Germany's honor is at stake. Is it       possible under these circumstances that the most peace-loving       monarch can do otherwise than take to the sword in order to defend       the most sacred interests of the nation?         And, finally, the German people! In them is firmly rooted the word       of Prince Bismarck against aggressive wars: \"One must not try to       look into the cards of Fate.\"         It must be stated again: Russia alone forces the war upon Europe.       Russia alone must carry the full weight of responsibility.             *       *       *       *       *          STATEMENT TO AMERICA.    Issued to The Associated Press from General Headquarters, Sept. 2.           I do not know what is thought of this war in America. I assume       there have been published in America the telegrams exchanged       between the German Emperor, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of       England, containing the history of the events that preceded the       outbreak of the war, and which bears irrefutable testimony of how       the Emperor, until the last moment, strove hard to preserve the       peace.         These efforts had to be futile, as Russia, under all circumstances,       had resolved upon war, and as England, which for decades had       encouraged the anti-German nationalism in Russia and France, did       not avail herself of the splendid opportunity offered her to prove       her often-emphasized love of peace, otherwise the war between       Germany and France and England could have been averted.         When once the archives are opened the world will learn how often       Germany extended to England her friendly hand, but England did not       desire the friendship of Germany. Jealous of the development of       Germany, and feeling that by German efficiency and German industry       she has been surpassed in some fields, she had the desire to crush       Germany by brute force, as she in former times subdued Spain,       Holland, and France. She believed the moment had arrived, and       therefore the entry of German troops into Belgium gave her a       welcome pretext to take part in the war.         Germany, however, was forced to enter Belgium because she had to       forestall the planned French advance, and Belgium only awaited this       advance to join France. That only a pretext was involved as far as       England is concerned is proved by the fact that already on the       afternoon of Aug. 2, that is, prior to the violation of Belgium       neutrality by Germany, Sir Edward Grey assured the French       Ambassador unconditionally of the help of England in case the       German fleet attacked the French coast.         Moral scruple, however, the English policy does not know. And thus       the English people, who always posed as the protagonist of freedom       and right, has allied itself with Russia, the representative of the       most terrible barbarism, a country that knows no spiritual or no       religious freedom, that tramples upon the freedom of peoples as       well as of individuals. Already England is beginning to recognize       that she has made a mistake in her calculations, and that Germany       will master her enemies. She is therefore trying by the pettiest       means to injure Germany as much as possible in her commerce and       colonies, by instigating Japan, regardless of the consequences to       the cultural community of the white race, to a pillaging expedition       against Kiao-Chau, and leading the negroes in Africa to fight       against the Germans in the colonies.         Having strangled the news service of Germany to the whole world,       and having opened the campaign against us with a falsehood, England       will tell your countrymen that the German troops burned down       Belgian villages and cities, but will pass over in silence the fact       that Belgian girls gouged out the eyes of defenseless wounded.       Officials of Belgian cities have invited our officers to dinner and       shot and killed them across the table. Contrary to all       international law, the whole civilian population of Belgium was       called out, and after having at first shown friendliness, carried       on in the rear of our troops a terrible warfare with concealed       weapons.         Belgian women cut the throats of soldiers whom they had quartered       in their homes while they were sleeping. England also will say       nothing of the dumdum bullets which are being used by the English       and French despite all conventions and their hypocritical       proclamations of humanity, which can be seen here in their original       packing as they were found on French and English prisoners of war.         The Emperor has authorized me to say all this and to state that he       has full confidence in the sense of justice of the American people,       which will not allow itself to be deceived through the war of       falsehood which our enemies are conducting against us.    The statement of the Chancellor concludes as follows:         Every one who has lived in Germany since the outbreak of the war       has been able to witness the great moral uprising of all Germans       who, pressed hard on all sides, cheerfully take the field for the       defense of their rights and their existence; every one knows that       this people is not capable of any unnecessary cruelty or of any       brutality. We will win, thanks to the great moral strength which       our just cause gives to our troops, and in the end the greatest       falsehoods will be able to obscure our victories as little as they       do our rights.             *       *       *       *       *          GERMANY'S ARMAMENTS.    Speech Delivered in the Reichstag, March 30, 1911.           I have asked to speak in order to make a few brief remarks on the       question of disarmament and arbitration. The Social Democratic       motion proposes that I should take steps to bring about a general       limitation of armaments. As a matter of fact, the idea of       disarmament is being constantly discussed by pacifists in       Parliaments and in Congresses far and wide. Even the first peace       conference at The Hague had to confine itself to expressing the       wish that the Governments should devote themselves to the continued       study of the question.         Germany has responded to this desire, but has been able to find no       suitable formula, and I am not aware that other Governments have       been more successful. The time when wars were made by Cabinets is       past. The feelings which here in Europe may lead to war lie       elsewhere.         They have their roots in antagonisms which must be found in popular       sentiment. Everybody knows how easily this sentiment is influenced       and how, unfortunately, in many cases, it abandons itself       helplessly to irresponsible press agitations. A counterpoise to       all such and similar influences can but be desired. I shall be the       first to welcome it whenever international efforts succeed in       creating such a counterpoise.         But if I am to take practical steps and am to propose mutual       disarmament to the other powers, then general pacific assurances       and adjurations are not enough. With Germany there is no need for       such assurances or adjurations, in view of her constant policy       throughout forty years, which shows that we seek no quarrels in the       world. I should have to submit a fixed, definite programme. Then I       should have to consider in all sobriety whether such a programme       could be drawn up and carried out. Any one who makes uncertain and       vague proposals can easily become a disturber of the peace rather       than a peacemaker.         I shall have to decline to draw up such a formula and submit it to       an international congress.    England's Naval Police.

On these tablets, or table-books Mr. Astle observes, that the Greeks and  Romans continued the use of waxed table-books long after the use of the  papyrus, leaves and skins became common; because they were convenient  for correcting extemporaneous compositions: from these table-books they  transcribed their performances correctly into parchment books, if for  their own private use; but if for sale, or for the library, the  _Librarii_, or Scribes, performed the office. The writing on table-books  is particularly recommended by Quintilian in the third chapter of the  tenth book of his Institutions; because the wax is readily effaced for  any corrections: he confesses weak eyes do not see so well on paper, and  observes that the frequent necessity of dipping the pen in the inkstand  retards the hand, and is but ill-suited to the celerity of the mind.  Some of these table-books are conjectured to have been large, and  perhaps heavy, for in Plautus, a school-boy is represented breaking his  master's head with his table-book. The critics, according to Cicero,  were accustomed in reading their wax manuscripts to notice obscure or  vicious phrases by joining a piece of red wax, as we should underline  such by red ink.    Table-hooks written upon with styles were not entirely laid aside in  Chaucer's time, who describes them in his Sompner's tale:--        His fellow had a staffe tipp'd with horne,      _A paire of tables all of iverie_;      And a _pointell polished_ fetouslie,      And wrote alwaies the names, as he stood,      Of all folke, that gave hem any good.[10]    By the word _pen_ in the translation of the Bible we must understand an  iron _style_. Table-books of ivory are still used for memoranda, written  with black-lead pencils. The Romans used ivory to write the edicts of  the senate on, with a black colour; and the expression of _libri  elephantini_, which some authors imagine alludes to books that for their  _size_ were called _elephantine_, were most probably composed of ivory,  the tusk of the elephant: among the Romans they were undoubtedly scarce.    The _pumice stone_ was a writing-material of the ancients; they used it  to smoothe the roughness of the parchment, or to sharpen their reeds.    In the progress of time the art of writing consisted in _painting_ with  different kinds of _ink_. This novel mode of writing occasioned them to  invent other materials proper to receive their writing; the thin bark of  certain _trees_ and _plants_, or _linen_; and at length, when this was  found apt to become mouldy, they prepared the _skins of animals_; on the  dried skins of serpents were once written the Iliad and Odyssey. The  first place where they began to dress these skins was _Pergamus_, in  Asia; whence the Latin name is derived of _Pergamenoe_ or _parchment_.  These skins are, however, better known amongst the authors of the purest  Latin under the name of _membrana_; so called from the membranes of  various animals of which they were composed. The ancients had  _parchments_ of three different colours, white, yellow, and purple. At  Rome white parchment was disliked, because it was more subject to be  soiled than the others, and dazzled the eye. They generally wrote in  letters of gold and silver on purple or violet parchment. This custom  continued in the early ages of the church; and copies of the evangelists  of this kind are preserved in the British Museum.    When the Egyptians employed for writing the _bark_ of a _plant_ or  _reed_, called _papyrus_, or paper-rush, it superseded all former modes,  for its convenience. Formerly it grew in great quantities on the sides  of the Nile. This plant has given its name to our _paper_, although the  latter is now composed of linen and rags, and formerly had been of  cotton-wool, which was but brittle and yellow; and improved by using  cotton rags, which they glazed. After the eighth century the papyrus was  superseded by parchment. The _Chinese_ make their _paper_ with _silk_.  The use of _paper_ is of great antiquity. It is what the ancient  Latinists call _charta_ or _chartae_. Before the use of _parchment_ and  _paper_ passed to the Romans, they used the thin peel found between the  wood and the bark of trees. This skinny substance they called _liber_,  from whence the Latin word _liber_, a book, and _library_ and  _librarian_ in the European languages, and the French _livre_ for book;  but we of northern origin derive our _book_ from the Danish _bog_, the  beech-tree, because that being the most plentiful in Denmark was used to  engrave on. Anciently, instead of folding this bark, this parchment, or  paper, as we fold ours, they rolled it according as they wrote on it;  and the Latin name which they gave these rolls has passed into our  language as well as the others. We say a _volume_, or volumes, although  our books are composed of leaves bound together. The books of the  ancients on the shelves of their libraries were rolled up on a pin and  placed erect, titled on the outside in red letters, or rubrics, and  appeared like a number of small pillars on the shelves.[11]    The ancients were as curious as ourselves in having their books richly  conditioned. Propertius describes tablets with gold borders, and Ovid  notices their red titles; but in later times, besides the tint of purple  with which they tinged their vellum, and the liquid gold which they  employed for their ink, they inlaid their covers with precious stones:  and I have seen, in the library at Triers or Treves, a manuscript, the  donation of some princess to a monastery, studded with heads wrought in  fine cameos.[12] In the early ages of the church they painted on the  outside commonly a dying Christ. In the curious library of Mr. Douce is  a Psalter, supposed once to have appertained to Charlemagne; the vellum  is purple, and the letters gold. The Eastern nations likewise tinged  their MSS. with different colours and decorations. Astle possessed  Arabian MSS. of which some leaves were of a deep yellow, and others of a  lilac colour. Sir William Jones describes an oriental MS. in which the  name of Mohammed was fancifully adorned with a garland of tulips and  carnations, painted in the brightest colours. The favourite works of the  Persians are written on fine silky paper, the ground of which is often  powdered with gold or silver dust; the leaves are frequently  illuminated, and the whole book is sometimes perfumed with essence of  roses, or sandal wood. The Romans had several sorts of paper, for which  they had as many different names; one was the _Charta Augusta_, in  compliment to the emperor; another _Livinia_, named after the empress.  There was a _Charta blanca_, which obtained its title from its beautiful  whiteness, and which we appear to have retained by applying it to a  blank sheet of paper which is only signed, _Charte Blanche_. They had  also a _Charta nigra_, painted black, and the letters were in white or  other colours.    Our present paper surpasses all other materials for ease and convenience  of writing. The first paper-mill in England was erected at Dartford, by  a German, in 1588, who was knighted by Elizabeth; but it was not before  1713 that one Thomas Watkins, a stationer, brought the art of  paper-making to any perfection, and to the industry of this individual  we owe the origin of our numerous paper-mills. France had hitherto  supplied England and Holland.    The manufacture of paper was not much encouraged at home, even so late  as in 1662; and the following observations by Fuller are curious,  respecting the paper of his times:--\"Paper participates in some sort of  the characters of the country which makes it; the _Venetian_, being  neat, subtile, and court-like; the _French_, light, slight, and slender;  the _Dutch_, thick, corpulent, and gross, sucking up the ink with the  sponginess thereof.\" He complains that the paper-manufactories were not  then sufficiently encouraged, \"considering the vast sums of money  expended in our land for paper, out of Italy, France, and Germany, which  might be lessened, were it made in our nation. To such who object that  we can never equal the perfection of _Venice-paper_, I return, neither  can we match the purity of Venice-glasses; and yet many _green ones_ are  blown in Sussex, profitable to the makers, and convenient for the users.  Our _home-spun paper_ might be found beneficial.\" The present German  printing-paper is made so disagreeable both to printers and readers from  their paper-manufacturers making many more reams of paper from one cwt.  of rags than formerly. Rags are scarce, and German writers, as well as  their language, are voluminous.    Mr. Astle deeply complains of the inferiority of our _inks_ to those of  antiquity; an inferiority productive of the most serious consequences,  and which appears to originate merely in negligence. From the important  benefits arising to society from the use of ink, and the injuries  individuals may suffer from the frauds of designing men, he wishes the  legislature would frame some new regulations respecting it. The  composition of ink is simple, but we possess none equal in beauty and  colour to that used by the ancients; the Saxon MSS. written in England  exceed in colour anything of the kind. The rolls and records from the  fifteenth century to the end of the seventeenth, compared with those of  the fifth to the twelfth centuries, show the excellence of the earlier  ones, which are all in the finest preservation; while the others are so  much defaced, that they are scarcely legible.    The ink of the ancients had nothing in common with ours, but the colour  and gum. Gall-nuts, copperas, and gum make up the composition of our  ink; whereas _soot_ or _ivory-black_ was the chief ingredient in that of  the ancients.[13]    Ink has been made of various colours; we find gold and silver ink, and  red, green, yellow, and blue inks; but the black is considered as"]]]
