Yuba Bill walked wrathfully toward  it, and turned the eye of his coach lantern upon its face. It was a  man's face, prematurely old and wrinkled, with very large eyes, in which  there was that expression of perfectly gratuitous solemnity which I had  sometimes seen in an owl's. The large eyes wandered from Bill's face  to the lantern, and finally fixed their gaze on that luminous object,  without further recognition.    Bill restrained himself with an effort.    \"Miggles! Be you deaf? You ain't dumb anyhow, you know\"; and Yuba Bill  shook the insensate figure by the shoulder.    To our great dismay, as Bill removed his hand, the venerable  stranger apparently collapsed--sinking into half his size and an  undistinguishable heap of clothing.    \"Well, dern my skin,\" said Bill, looking appealingly at us, and  hopelessly retiring from the contest.    The Judge now stepped forward, and we lifted the mysterious invertebrate  back into his original position. Bill was dismissed with the lantern to  reconnoiter outside, for it was evident that from the helplessness of  this solitary man there must be attendants near at hand, and we all  drew around the fire. The Judge, who had regained his authority, and had  never lost his conversational amiability--standing before us with his  back to the hearth--charged us, as an imaginary jury, as follows:    \"It is evident that either our distinguished friend here has reached  that condition described by Shakespeare as 'the sere and yellow leaf,'  or has suffered some premature abatement of his mental and physical  faculties. Whether he is really the Miggles--\"    Here he was interrupted by \"Miggles! O Miggles! Migglesy! Mig!\" and, in  fact, the whole chorus of Miggles in very much the same key as it had  once before been delivered unto us.    We gazed at each other for a moment in some alarm. The Judge, in  particular, vacated his position quickly, as the voice seemed to come  directly over his shoulder. The cause, however, was soon discovered in  a large magpie who was perched upon a shelf over the fireplace, and  who immediately relapsed into a sepulchral silence which contrasted  singularly with his previous volubility. It was, undoubtedly, his voice  which we had heard in the road, and our friend in the chair was not  responsible for the discourtesy. Yuba Bill, who re-entered the room  after an unsuccessful search, was loath to accept the explanation, and  still eyed the helpless sitter with suspicion. He had found a shed in  which he had put up his horses, but he came back dripping and skeptical.  \"Thar ain't nobody but him within ten mile of the shanty, and that 'ar  damned old skeesicks knows it.\"    But the faith of the majority proved to be securely based. Bill had  scarcely ceased growling before we heard a quick step upon the porch,  the trailing of a wet skirt, the door was flung open, and with flash of  white teeth, a sparkle of dark eyes, and an utter absence of ceremony or  diffidence, a young woman entered, shut the door, and, panting, leaned  back against it.    \"Oh, if you please, I'm Miggles!\"    And this was Miggles! this bright-eyed, full-throated young woman, whose  wet gown of coarse blue stuff could not hide the beauty of the feminine  curves to which it clung; from the chestnut crown of whose head, topped  by a man's oilskin sou'wester, to the little feet and ankles, hidden  somewhere in the recesses of her boy's brogans, all was grace--this was  Miggles, laughing at us, too, in the most airy, frank, offhand manner  imaginable.    \"You see, boys,\" said she, quite out of breath, and holding one little  hand against her side, quite unheeding the speechless discomfiture of  our party, or the complete demoralization of Yuba Bill, whose  features had relaxed into an expression of gratuitous and imbecile  cheerfulness--\"you see, boys, I was mor'n two miles away when you passed  down the road. I thought you might pull up here, and so I ran the  whole way, knowing nobody was home but Jim,--and--and--I'm out of  breath--and--that lets me out.\"    And here Miggles caught her dripping oilskin hat from her head, with  a mischievous swirl that scattered a shower of raindrops over us;  attempted to put back her hair; dropped two hairpins in the attempt;  laughed and sat down beside Yuba Bill, with her hands crossed lightly on  her lap.    The Judge recovered himself first, and essayed an extravagant  compliment.    \"I'll trouble you for that thar harpin,\" said Miggles, gravely. Half  a dozen hands were eagerly stretched forward; the missing hairpin was  restored to its fair owner; and Miggles, crossing the room, looked  keenly in the face of the invalid. The solemn eyes looked back at hers  with an expression we had never seen before. Life and intelligence  seemed to struggle back into the rugged face. Miggles laughed again--it  was a singularly eloquent laugh--and turned her black eyes and white  teeth once more toward us.    \"This afflicted person is--\" hesitated the Judge.    \"Jim,\" said Miggles.    \"Your father?\"    \"No.\"    \"Brother?\"    \"No.\"    \"Husband?\"    Miggles darted a quick, half-defiant glance at the two lady passengers  who I had noticed did not participate in the general masculine  admiration of Miggles, and said gravely, \"No; it's Jim.\"    There was an awkward pause. The lady passengers moved closer to each  other; the Washoe husband looked abstractedly at the fire; and the  tall man apparently turned his eyes inward for self-support at this  emergency. But Miggles's laugh, which was very infectious, broke the  silence. \"Come,\" she said briskly, \"you must be hungry. Who'll bear a  hand to help me get tea?\"    She had no lack of volunteers. In a few moments Yuba Bill was engaged  like Caliban in bearing logs for this Miranda; the expressman was  grinding coffee on the veranda; to myself the arduous duty of slicing  bacon was assigned; and the Judge lent each man his good-humored  and voluble counsel. And when Miggles, assisted by the Judge and  our Hibernian \"deck passenger,\" set the table with all the available  crockery, we had become quite joyous, in spite of the rain that beat  against windows, the wind that whirled down the chimney, the two ladies  who whispered together in the corner, or the magpie who uttered a  satirical and croaking commentary on their conversation from his perch  above. In the now bright, blazing fire we could see that the walls were  papered with illustrated journals, arranged with feminine taste and  discrimination. The furniture was extemporized, and adapted from candle  boxes and packing-cases, and covered with gay calico, or the skin of  some animal. The armchair of the helpless Jim was an ingenious variation  of a flour barrel. There was neatness, and even a taste for the  picturesque, to be seen in the few details of the long low room.    The meal was a culinary success. But more, it was a social  triumph--chiefly, I think, owing to the rare tact of Miggles in  guiding the conversation, asking all the questions herself, yet bearing  throughout a frankness that rejected the idea of any concealment on  her own part, so that we talked of ourselves, of our prospects, of the  journey, of the weather, of each other--of everything but our host and  hostess. It must be confessed that Miggles's conversation was never  elegant, rarely grammatical, and that at times she employed expletives  the use of which had generally been yielded to our sex. But they were  delivered with such a lighting-up of teeth and eyes, and were usually  followed by a laugh--a laugh peculiar to Miggles--so frank and honest  that it seemed to clear the moral atmosphere.    Once during the meal we heard a noise like the rubbing of a heavy body  against the outer walls of the house. This was shortly followed by a  scratching and sniffling at the door. \"That's Joaquin,\" said Miggles, in  reply to our questioning glances; \"would you like to see him?\" Before  we could answer she had opened the door, and disclosed a half-grown  grizzly, who instantly raised himself on his haunches, with his  forepaws hanging down in the popular attitude of mendicancy, and looked  admiringly at Miggles, with a very singular resemblance in his manner to  Yuba Bill. \"That's my watch dog,\" said Miggles, in explanation. \"Oh,  he don't bite,\" she added, as the two lady passengers fluttered into  a corner. \"Does he, old Toppy?\" (the latter remark being addressed  directly to the sagacious Joaquin). \"I tell you what, boys,\" continued  Miggles after she had fed and closed the door on URSA MINOR, \"you  were in big luck that Joaquin wasn't hanging round when you dropped  in tonight.\" \"Where was he?\" asked the Judge. \"With me,\" said Miggles.  \"Lord love you; he trots round with me nights like as if he was a man.\"    We were silent for a few moments, and listened to the wind. Perhaps we  all had the same picture before us--of Miggles walking through the rainy  woods, with her savage guardian at her side. The Judge, I remember, said  something about Una and her lion; but Miggles received it as she did  other compliments, with quiet gravity. Whether she was altogether  unconscious of the admiration she excited--she could hardly have been  oblivious of Yuba Bill's adoration--I know not; but her very frankness  suggested a perfect sexual equality that was cruelly humiliating to the  younger members of our party.    The incident of the bear did not add anything in Miggles's favor to the  opinions of those of her own sex who were present. In fact, the repast  over, a chillness radiated from the two lady passengers that no pine  boughs brought in by Yuba Bill and cast as a sacrifice upon the hearth  could wholly overcome. Miggles felt it; and, suddenly declaring that  it was time to \"turn in,\" offered to show the ladies to their bed in an  adjoining room. \"You boys will have to camp out here by the fire as well  as you can,\" she added, \"for thar ain'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13121"],[0,"A Voyage to Terra Australis — Volume 2 (#7)"],[1,"by captain Cook; so that both the openings escaped his notice, and  the discovery of the port fell to our lot. In honour of admiral Sir Roger  Curtis, who had commanded at the Cape of Good Hope and been so attentive  to our wants, I gave to it the name of PORT CURTIS; and the island which  protects it from the sea, and in fact forms the port, was called _Facing  Island_. It is a slip of rather low land, eight miles in length, and from  two to half a mile in breadth, having Gatcombe Head for its southern  extremity.    The northern entrance to Port Curtis is accessible only to boats; but  ships of any size may enter the port by the southern opening. Mr. Murray  did not find any passage on the south side of the shoal near Gatcombe  Head, but could not say that none existed; he thought the deep channel to  be not more than a mile wide; but at half a mile from the head there was  from 6 to 10 fathoms, and the channel from thence leads fair up the port  to beyond South-trees Point; I suspected, however, from the account given  by Mr. Murray, that there might be a second shoal, lying not so much as a  mile from the head, and one is marked in the plan accordingly, that ships  may be induced to greater caution. There is good anchorage just within  Gatcombe Head; and at a small beach there, behind a rock, is a rill of  fresh water, and wood is easily to be procured.    I cannot venture to give any other sailing directions for going up this  port, than to run cautiously, with a boat ahead and the plan upon the  binnacle. Both the bottom and shoals are usually a mixture of sand, with  mud or clay; but in the northern entrance, and off some of the upper  points and islands where the tides run strong, the ground is in general  rocky.    The country round Port Curtis is overspread with grass, and produces the  _eucalyptus_ and other trees common to this coast; yet the soil is either  sandy or covered with loose stones, and generally incapable of  cultivation. Much of the shores and the low islands are overspread with  mangroves, of three different species; but that which sends down roots,  or rather supporters from the branches, and interweaves so closely as to  be almost impenetrable, was the most common. This species, the  _Rhizophora Mangle_ of Linnaeus, is also the most abundant in the East  and West Indies; but is not found at Port Jackson, nor upon the south  coast of this country.    Granite, streaked red and black, and cracked in all directions, appeared  to be the common stone in the upper parts of the port; but a stratified  argillaceous stone was not unfrequent; and upon the larger island, lying  off the point of Hill View, there was a softish, white earth, which I  took to be calcareous until it was tried with acids, and did not produce  any effervescence.    Traces of inhabitants were found upon all the shores where we landed, but  the natives kept out of sight after the little skirmish on the first day  of our arrival; they subsist partly on turtle, and possess bark canoes  and scoop nets. We saw three turtle lying on the water, but were not so  fortunate as to procure any. Fish seemed to be plentiful, and some were  speared by Bongaree, who was a constant attendant in my boat; and yet our  efforts with the seine were altogether unsuccessful. The shores abound  with oysters, amongst which, in the upper parts of the port, was the kind  producing pearls; but being small and discoloured, they are of no value.  The attempts made near the ship with the dredge, to procure larger  oysters from the deep water, were without success.    I saw no quadrupeds in the woods, and almost no birds; but there were  some pelicans, gulls, and curlews about the shores and flats. Fresh water  was found in small pools on both sides of the northern entrance, and at  the point of Hill View I met with some in holes; but that which best  merits the attention of a ship, is the rill found by Mr. Murray at the  back of the small beach within Gatcombe Head.    The _latitude_ of our anchorage at the northern entrance, from four  meridian altitudes of the sun, is 23 deg. 44' 16\" south.    Six sets of distances of the sun west of the moon, taken by lieutenant  Flinders, would make the _longitude_ 151 deg. 21' 22\" east; the two time  keepers gave 151 deg. 20' 10\"; and fifty sets of distances, reduced from  Broad Sound by the survey, which I consider to be the best authority,  place the anchorage in  151 deg. 20' 15\" east.    These being reduced by the survey to the southern entrance, place  Gatcombe Head in latitude 23 deg. 521/2 deg. S. longitude 151 deg. 24' E.    No _variations_ were observed at the anchorage; but two amplitudes off  Gatcombe Head gave 11 deg. 11', and azimuths with three compasses, 10 deg. 50'  east, the ship's head being W. S. W. and W. N. W. These being reduced to  the meridian, will give the true variation to be 8 deg. 40' east.    This is an increase of near 2 deg. from Bustard Bay; and seems attributable  to the attraction of the granitic land which lay to the westward, and  drew the south end of the needle that way.    The rise of _tide_ at the place where I slept near the head of the port,  was no more than four feet; but upon the rocky islet in the northern  entrance, there were marks of its having risen the double of that  quantity. The time of high water was not well ascertained, but it will be  between eight and nine hours after the moon's passage over and under the  meridian.    MONDAY 9 AUGUST 1902    On getting under way at daylight of the 9th, to prosecute the examination  of the coast, the anchor came up with an arm broken off, in consequence  of a flaw extending two-thirds through the iron. The negligence with  which this anchor had been made, might in some cases have caused the loss  of the ship.    [EAST COAST. KEPPEL BAY.]    In following the low and rather sandy shore, northward to Cape Capricorn,  we passed within a rocky islet and another composed of rock and sand,  four miles south-east of the cape, the soundings being there from 8 to 9  fathoms; and at ten o'clock hauled round for Cape Keppel, which lies from  Cape Capricorn N. 80 deg. W., ten miles. The shore is low, with some small  inlets in it, and sand banks with shoal water run off more than two  miles; at six miles out there is a hummocky island and four rocks, one of  which was at first taken for a ship. We passed within these, as captain  Cook had before done; and at half past two in the afternoon anchored in  Keppel Bay, in 6 fathoms soft bottom, three-quarters of a mile from a  head on the east side of the entrance.    My object in stopping at this bay was to explore two openings marked in  it by captain Cook, which it was possible might be the entrances of  rivers leading into the interior. So soon as the ship was secured, a boat  was sent to haul the seine, and I landed with a party of the gentlemen to  inspect the bay from an eminence called _Sea Hill_. There were four  places where the water penetrated into the land, but none of these  openings were large; that on the west side, in which were two islands,  was the most considerable, and the hills near it were sufficiently  elevated to afford an extensive view; whereas in most other parts, the  shores were low and covered with mangroves. These considerations induced  me to begin the proposed examination by the western arm; and early next  morning [TUESDAY 10 AUGUST 1802] I embarked in the Lady Nelson, intending  to employ her and my whale boat in exploring the bay and inlets, whilst  the botanists made their excursions in the neighbourhood of the ship.    The depth in steering for the western arm was from 6 to 9 fathoms, for  about one mile, when it diminished quickly to 2, upon a shoal which  seemed to run up the bay; the water afterwards deepened to 5 and 7  fathoms, but meeting with a second shoal, the brig was obliged to anchor.  I then went on in my boat for the nearest of the two islands, passing  over the banks and crossing the narrow, deep channels marked in the plan.  The two islands are mostly very low, and the shores so muddy and covered  with mangroves, that a landing on the northern and highest of them could  be effected only at the west end; but a hillock there enabled me to take  an useful set of bearings, including Mount Larcom, which is visible from  all parts of this bay, as it is from Port Curtis.    In the afternoon I proceeded up the western arm, having from 3 to 8  fathoms close along the northern shore; and about four miles up, where  the width was diminished to one mile, found a landing place, a rare  convenience here, and ascended a hill from whence there was a good view.  At five or six leagues to the south, and extending thence north-westward,  was a continuation of the same chain of hills which rises near Bustard  Bay and passes behind Mount Larcom; but at the back of Keppel Bay it  forms a more connected ridge, and is rocky, steep, and barren. Within  this ridge the land is low, and intersected by various streams, some  falling into the western arm at ten or twelve miles above the entrance,  and others into the south-west and south arms of the bay. The borders of  the western arm, and of its upper branches so far as could be perceived,  were over-run with mangroves; whence it seemed probable the water was  salt, and that no landing was practicable, higher than this station; the  sun also was near setting when my bearings from _West-arm Hill_ were  completed; and I therefore gave up the intention of proceeding further,  and returned to the northern island in the entrance, to pass the night.    It was high water here at seven in the evening, and the tide fell nine  and a half feet; but the morning's tide rose to six and a half only  [WEDNESDAY 11 AUGUST 1802]. In rowing out between the two islands, I had  from 8 to 3 fathoms; but shoal water in crossing from thence to the  entrance of the south-west arm, where again there was 5 to 8 fathoms. A  strong"]]]
