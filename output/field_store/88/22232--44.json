Should it ever  come to pass during the progress of the war, I devoutly hope that I may be  handy to witness the struggle. It will not be a long-range fight if I am  any judge of men and things; it will be settled at close quarters, and the  \"baynit and the butt\" will play a prominent part in the _melee_.    A few of our New Zealand fellows got to close quarters with the enemy  recently up Colesberg way, and they did just as we knew they would when it  came to the crossing of steel. The Boers stormed the position, and the New  Zealanders joined in the bayonet charge which drove them back. Our men had  a couple killed and one or two wounded. The enemy left a goodish number of  dead on the field when they retired, about thirty of whom met their fate at  the bayonet's point. The British losses were small. There was nothing  remarkable about the behaviour of the New Zealanders in action; they simply  did coolly and well what they were ordered to do, and proved that they are  quite as good fighting material as anything the Old Country can produce.  The gravest misfortune which has yet befallen any of the Australians  happened at the same locality, when eighteen New South Welshmen allowed  themselves to be pinned in a tight place. Eight escaped, but the others are  either prisoners or killed. We do not like the surrender business, and  would rather see our men do as their fathers and grandfathers used to  do--bite the motto, \"No surrender,\" into the butts of their rifles with  their teeth, and fight their way out of a hot corner. There has been a good  deal too much of this throwing up of arms during the present campaign, and  I hope that we shall hear less of it in the future.    We had a nasty night here at Enslin. Word reached our headquarters that  three thousand mounted Boers were on the move towards our camp, which, for  strategic purposes, is the most important between Methuen's column and De  Aar. If the enemy could take Enslin they could make things very awkward for  General Methuen, because they would then have him between two fires. As  soon as the news came our fellows, with the Gordons, were ordered to occupy  the surrounding heights. All night long, and well on into the day, we held  them until we learned that the enemy had decided not to attack us. Had they  done so they would have paid bitterly for their rashness, for the place is  practically impregnable. A thousand resolute and skilful men, who knew how  to use both rifle and bayonet, could hold the place against 20,000 of the  finest troops in the world, providing the defenders were not hopelessly  crushed by an immense artillery force.    General Hector Macdonald went through here the other day to take the  command of the Highland Brigade, in the place of the late General Wauchope.  The \"Scots\" who were with us lined up and gave the General a thrilling  welcome, whilst our fellows, who are not usually demonstrative, crowded  around the railway line to get a look at the brilliant soldier who, by  sheer merit, dauntless pluck, and iron resolution, forced his way from the  ranks to the high place he holds. The Australians had expected to see a  gaunt, prematurely aged man, war-worn and battle-broken, and were surprised  to see a dashing, gallant-looking man, who might in appearance comfortably  have passed for five-and-thirty. The grey-clad men, in soft slouch hats,  from the land of the Southern Cross, lounging about with pipes in their  teeth, did not break into hysterical cheering--they are not built that way;  they simply looked at the man whose full history every one of them knew as  well as he knew the way into the front door of a \"pub.\" But their flashing  eyes and clenched hands told in language more eloquent than a salvo of  cheers that this was their ideal man, the man they would follow rifle in  hand up the brimstone heights of hell itself, if need be; aye, and stand  sentry there until the day of judgment, if Hector Macdonald gave the order.                                     AUSTRALIA ON THE MOVE.                                                                      RENSBURG.      A complete change has come to the Australians who are in Africa under  Colonel Hoad. We have left General Methuen's column, and joined that of  General French. Formerly we were at Enslin, within sound of the guns that  were fired daily at Magersfontein; now we are two hundred and twenty miles  away, and are within easy patrolling distance of Colesberg.    Before we left Methuen's column we had one small night affair, which,  however, did not amount to a great deal, though it has been very much  exaggerated in local newspaper circles, and will, I fear, be unduly boomed  in some of the Australian journals. The whole affair simply amounted to  this. One hundred of the Victorian Mounted Rifles went out to make a  demonstration towards Sunnyside, in Cape Colony, where a number of rebels  were known to congregate. A hundred Queenslanders and Canadians were with  them, when a corporal and a trooper of the Victorians saw an unarmed Boer  and a nigger riding towards them in the twilight. The Boer, as soon as he  was challenged, wheeled his horse and rode off at a gallop; our men rode  after the runaway, but would not fire upon the white man because they  thought he was simply a farmer who had got rather a bad scare at meeting  armed men.    The Boer, however, played a deep game; he rode for a bit of a rise composed  of broken ground, where, unknown to our scouts, a party of rebels lay  concealed. As soon as the flying rebel was in safety the Boers opened fire,  shooting Peter Falla, the trooper, twice through the arm, one bullet  entering a few inches below the shoulder, the other shattering the bone a  little way above the elbow. The corporal got away safely, taking his  wounded comrade with him. Our fellows rode out and swept the veldt for  miles, but saw no more of the enemy. So ended what has grandiloquently been  termed \"an Australian engagement,\" which, I may add, is just the kind of  flapdoodle our troopers do not want. What they most desire on earth at  present is an opportunity to show what they are made of. They don't want  cheap newspaper puffs, nor laudatory speeches from generals. They want to  get into grip with the enemy, and, as an Australian, let me say now that  Imperial federation will get a greater shock by keeping these fine fellows  out of action than by anything else that could happen under heaven. They  did not come here on a picnic party, they did not come for a circus; they  don't want a lot of maudlin sentiment wasted on them whilst they stay out  of the firing line to mind the jam, or give the African girls a treat.    Mr. Chamberlain has made a good many mistakes in regard to the war,  mistakes that will live in history when his very name is forgotten, but he  need not add to them by alienating Australian sentiment by coddling men who  came across the Indian Ocean to prove to the whole world that on the field  of battle they are as good as their sires. Our fellows have got hold of a  rumour (the prophets only could tell whence camp rumours originate) that  instructions have been received from England that they are to be kept out  of danger, and a madder lot of men you could not find anywhere between here  and Tophet. They wanted to send a petition to Lord Roberts asking to be  allowed to face the enemy, but though the officers are quite as sore as the  men, they could not permit such a breach of discipline. So now the men ease  their feelings by jeering at each other.    \"What are we here fer, Bill?\"    \"Oh, get yer head felt; any fool knows why we are here. There's a blessed  marmalade factory somewhere about, and we are going to mind it whilst the  British Tommy does the fighting.\"    \"Marmalade be d----!\" chirruped a voice down the lines. \"Think they'd trust  us to look after anything so important?\"    \"Oh, you're a blessed prophet, you are,\" snarls the little bugler. \"P'raps  you'll tell us what our game is.\"    \"Easy enough, little 'un. Our officers 've got to practise making mud maps  in the dust with a stick, and we've got to fool around and keep the flies  away.\"    \"I suppose they'll keep us at this till the war's over, and then send us to  England, 'nd give us a bloomin' medal, 'nd tell us then we are gory,  crimson heroes. Ugh!\" grunts a big West Australian with a face like a  nightmare, and a voice that comes out of his chest with a sound like a  steam saw coming through a wet log.    \"Don't know about England 'nd the medal, 'Beauty,'\" chirrups a Sydney  gunner, \"but I know what they'll give us in Australia if we go back without  a fight.\"    \"P'raps it'll be a mansion, or a sheep station, or a stud of racehorses,\"  meekly suggests a tired-looking South Australian, with a derisive twist of  his under lip.    \"No, they won't present us with a racing stud,\" lisps the gunner, \"but, by  G----, they'll shy chaff enough at us to keep all the bloomin' horses  between 'ere and 'ell, and the girls will send us a kid's feedin' bottle,  as a mark of feelin' and esteem, every Valentine's Day for ten years to  come, because of the glorious name we made for Australia on the bloody  fields of war in Africa.\"    \"Fields o' war--fields o' whisky 'nd watermelons! Oh, d---- it! I'm going  ter stop writing ter my girl before she writes ter tell me that a white  feather don't suit a girl's complexion in Australia.\"    He lifts his bugle, and sounds \"Feed up\" so savagely that the horses strain  on their leg ropes and kick themselves into a lather as hot as their  riders' tempers, the long, loose-limbed troopers move off, cursing  artistically in their beards at the very thought of the roasting they will  get from the witty-tongued, red-lipped"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#7)"],[1,"which shall preserve  you forever from sickness, age, and death.\"    At this promise the Peacock was greatly tempted and began to hesitate in  his refusals. And at last he said,--    \"I dare not myself let you in, O stranger, but if you keep your promise  I will send the Serpent, who is wiser than I and who may more easily  find some way to let you enter unobserved.\"    So it was through the Peacock that Satan met the vile Serpent, whose  shape he assumed in order to enter the garden and tempt Eve with the  apple. And for the Peacock's share in the doings of that dreadful day  the Lord took away his beautiful voice and sent him forth from the  pleasant garden to chatter harshly in this workaday world, where his  gorgeousness and his vanity are but a reminder to men of the shame which  he brought upon their ancestors.           *       *       *       *       *    \"And therefore,\" said the Crow, concluding his gossip, \"therefore, dear  Pheasant, I see no reason why we should envy your cousin. We are very  plain citizens of Birdland, but we are at least respectable. I like you  much better, having nothing to make you vain, nothing of which to be  ashamed.\"           *       *       *       *       *    So the Crow spoke, in the wisdom which he had learned from Solomon. But  the Peacock's cousin refused to be comforted. The shabbiness of his coat  preyed upon his mind, and he fancied that the other birds jeered at him  because in such old clothes he dared to be the Peacock's cousin. It  seemed to him that every day the Peacock himself grew more haughty and  more patronizing.    One day the Crow and the Peacock's cousin were sauntering through the  Malay woods when they met the Peacock face to face. The Crow looked  defiant and stood jauntily; but the Pheasant tried to shrink out of  sight. The Peacock, however, had spied his poor relative, and was filled  with cousinly resentment at his appearance.    He stopped short. He stood upon one leg. He puffed and ruffled himself,  spreading out his thousand-eyed tail so that its colors flashed  wonderfully in the sunshine. He frilled his neck feathers and snapped  his mean little eyes maliciously; then turning his back on the shabby  couple said, as he stepped airily away,--    \"Ah, I have dropped some of my old feathers back there a little way. You  can have them if you like, Pheasant. They will freshen you up a bit; you  really are looking shockingly seedy. But for mercy's sake don't wear  them in my presence! I can't bear to see any one parading in my cast-off  elegance.\" Then the Peacock minced away.    The Peacock's cousin stamped on the ground and flapped his wings with  rage. If he had been a girl he would have burst into tears. \"I cannot  stand this,\" he cried. \"To be treated as if I were a beggar! To be given  old clothes to wear! Crow, Crow, if you were any kind of friend you  would help me. But you stand staring there and see me insulted, without  turning a feather! What is the use of all your wisdom that you learned  from King Solomon if you cannot help a friend in need? I tell you, I  must have some better garments, or I shall die of mortification.\"    \"Don't be excited,\" said the Crow soothingly. \"I have been thinking the  matter over, and I believe I can do something. Listen. Yesterday I found  brushes and a box of colors in a room of the King's palace. They  belonged to the Court Painter. Now they belong to me, for I have hidden  them away in a hollow tree where no one else can find them. I thought  they might be useful, and I think so still.\"    \"Well, well! What do you propose to do with paints and brushes?\" cried  the Peacock's cousin impatiently.    \"I propose to paint you, to varnish you, to gild you,\" patiently  answered the Crow.    \"Oh, you dear Crow!\" exclaimed the other, clapping his wings. \"You will  make me brilliant and beautiful! You will make me worthy of the  Peacock, will you not? How clever of you to think of such a thing!\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Crow; \"I watched the Court Painter at work in the  garden one day, and I know how it is done. I will make you as gorgeous  as you wish. But you must return the compliment. If you are to be an  ornament of fashion, so must I be; for are we not inseparable cronies?  And when you become beautiful it would not do for you to be seen with  such a dowdy as I am.\"    \"You dear creature!\" said the Peacock's cousin affectionately; \"of  course we will share alike. I will paint you as soon as I see how you  succeed with me. Ah, I know your skill in everything. You will be a fine  artist, my friend! But come, let us get to work at once.\"    So the flattered Crow led him to the hollow tree where he had concealed  the brushes and the gilding and the India ink, and all the gorgeous  changeable tints which an Eastern artist uses in his paintings. \"Here we  are,\" said the Crow. \"Now let us see what we shall see, when Master Crow  turns painter.\"    The Crow set to work with a will, splashing on the colors generously,  gold and green and bronze iridescence. He had the Peacock in mind, and  though he did not exactly copy the plumage of that wonderful bird, he  managed to suggest the cousinship of the Pheasant in the golden eyes of  his long and beautiful tail. When he had finished, the Crow was  delighted with his work.    \"Ah!\" he cried. \"Now bend over this fountain, my dear friend, and  observe yourself. I think you do credit to my skill as an artist, eh?\"    The Peacock's cousin hurried down to the water-pool, all in a flutter of  excitement. And when he saw his image he cried, \"How beautiful, how  truly beautiful, I am! Why, I am quite as handsome as Peacock himself.  Surely, now he need not be ashamed to call me cousin. I shall move in  the most fashionable circles. Heavens! Look at my lovely tail! Look at  my burnished feathers! I must go immediately and show my new dress to  Cousin Peacock. I should not be surprised if he became jealous of my  gorgeousness.\" And off he started as fast as he could go.    \"Hold on!\" cried the Crow. \"Don't run away so quickly. You have  forgotten something. Don't you remember that you promised to paint me  beautiful like yourself?\"    \"Oh, bother!\" answered the ungrateful friend, tossing his head. \"I have  no time now for such business. I must hasten to my cousin, for this is a  matter of family pride. Run along like a good creature; and by the way,  you may as well gather the feathers which Peacock mentioned. I am sure  they will make you look quite respectable. Besides, I will give you some  of mine when I have worn them a little. Ta-ta!\" And he stepped airily  away.    But the Crow strode after him, shaking his wings and crying, \"Come back,  come back and perform your part of the bargain, you selfish, ungrateful  creature!\" And he caught the Pheasant by one of his long tail-feathers.    \"Let go my train, impertinent wretch!\" shrieked the Peacock's cousin,  turning upon him fiercely. \"I tell you I have no time to spend in such  nonsense. I must be presenting myself in high society.\"    \"Villain!\" croaked the Crow, and he rushed forward fiercely, intending  to tear out the beautiful feathers which he had painted for his  ungrateful friend. Thereupon the Pheasant exclaimed,--    \"You want to be painted, do you? Well, take _that_!\" and, seizing the  bottle of India ink which was in the Eastern artist's paint-box, he  hurled it at the poor Crow, deluging with blackness his spotless  feathers. Then laughing harshly, away he flew to his cousin the Peacock,  who received him with proud affection, because they were now really  birds of a feather. For the Peacock's cousin was become one of the most  beautiful birds in the world.    But the poor Crow was now a sombre, black bird, wearing the  seedy-looking, inky coat which we know so well to-day. His heart was  broken by his friend's faithlessness, and he became a sour cynic who can  see no good in anything. He flies about crying \"Caw! Caw!\" in the most  disagreeable, sarcastic tone, as if sneering at the mean action of that  Malay bird, which he can never forget.          THE MASQUERADING CROW      The Crow became very sour and disagreeable after his friend the  Peacock's cousin deserted him for more gorgeous company. Though he  pretended not to care because the Pheasant was now a proud,  beautifully-coated dandy, while he was the shabbiest of all the birds in  his coat of rusty black, yet in truth he did care very much. He could  not forget how the Peacock's cousin had dyed him this sombre hue, after  promising to paint him bright and wonderful, like himself. He could not  help thinking how fine he would have looked in similar plumage of a  rainbow tint, or how becoming a long swallow-tail would be to his style  of beauty. He wished that there was a tailor in Birdland to whom he  could go for a new suit of clothes. But alas! There seemed no way but  for him to remain ugly old Crow to the end of the chapter.    The Crow went moping about most unhappily while this was preying on his  mind, until he really became somewhat crazy upon the subject. The only  thing about which he could think was clothes--clothes--clothes; and  that is indeed a foolish matter to absorb one's mind. One word of the  Peacock's cousin remained in his memory and refused to be forgotten. He  had advised the Crow to gather up the feathers which had fallen from the  Peacock's plumage and to make himself fine with them. First the Crow  remembered these words sadly, because they showed the unkind heart of  his old friend. Next he remembered them with scorn, because they showed  vanity. Then he remembered them with interest because they gave him an  idea. And that idea gradually grew bigger and bigger until it became a  plan.    The plan came to him completely one day while he was sitting moodily on  a tree watching the Peacock and his cousin sweeping proudly over the  velvet lawn of the King's garden. For nowadays the Pheasant moved in the  most courtly circles,"]]]
