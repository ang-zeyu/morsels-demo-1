For every offence the punishment is slavery, and the offences are daily  artificially increased, that the wealth of the few in human beings may  grow with them. If a man in his hunger steal a loaf, he becomes a slave;  that is, it is proclaimed he must make good to the State the injury he  has done it, and must work out his trespass. This is not assessed as the  value of the loaf, nor supposed to be confined to the individual from  whom it was taken.    The theft is said to damage the State at large, because it corrupts the  morality of the commonwealth; it is as if the thief had stolen a loaf,  not from one, but from every member of the State. Restitution must,  therefore, be made to all, and the value of the loaf returned in labour  a thousandfold. The thief is the bondsman of the State. But as the State  cannot employ him, he is leased out to those who will pay into the  treasury of the prince the money equivalent to the labour he is capable  of performing. Thus, under cover of the highest morality, the greatest  iniquity is perpetrated. For the theft of a loaf, the man is reduced to  a slave; then his wife and children, unable to support themselves,  become a charge to the State, that is, they beg in the public ways.    This, too, forsooth, corrupts morality, and they likewise are seized and  leased out to any who like to take them. Nor can he or they ever become  free again, for they must repay to their proprietor the sum he gave for  them, and how can that be done, since they receive no wages? For  striking another, a man may be in the same way, as they term it,  forfeited to the State, and be sold to the highest bidder. A stout brass  wire is then twisted around his left wrist loosely, and the ends  soldered together. Then a bar of iron being put through, a half turn is  given to it, which forces the wire sharply against the arm, causing it  to fit tightly, often painfully, and forms a smaller ring at the  outside. By this smaller ring a score of bondsmen may be seen strung  together with a rope.    To speak disrespectfully of the prince or his council, or of the nobles,  or of religion, to go out of the precincts without permission, to trade  without license, to omit to salute the great, all these and a thousand  others are crimes deserving of the brazen bracelet. Were a man to study  all day what he must do, and what he must not do, to escape servitude,  it would not be possible for him to stir one step without becoming  forfeit! And yet they hypocritically say that these things are done for  the sake of public morality, and that there are not slaves (not  permitting the word to be used), and no man was ever sold.    It is, indeed, true that no man is sold in open market, he is leased  instead; and, by a refined hypocrisy, the owner of slaves cannot sell  them to another owner, but he can place them in the hands of the notary,  presenting them with their freedom, so far as he is concerned. The  notary, upon payment of a fine from the purchaser, transfers them to  him, and the larger part of the fine goes to the prince. Debt alone  under their laws must crowd the land with slaves, for, as wages are  scarcely known, a child from its birth is often declared to be in debt.  For its nourishment is drawn from its mother, and the wretched mother is  the wife of a retainer who is fed by his lord. To such a degree is this  tyranny carried! If any owe a penny, his doom is sealed; he becomes a  bondsman, and thus the estates of the nobles are full of men who work  during their whole lives for the profit of others. Thus, too, the woods  are filled with banditti, for those who find an opportunity never fail  to escape, notwithstanding the hunt that is invariably made for them,  and the cruel punishment that awaits recapture. And numbers, foreseeing  that they must become bondsmen, before they are proclaimed forfeit steal  away by night, and live as they may in the forests.    How, then, does any man remain free? Only by the favour of the nobles,  and only that he may amass wealth for them. The merchants, and those who  have license to trade by land or water, are all protected by some noble  house, to whom they pay heavily for permission to live in their own  houses. The principal tyrant is supported by the nobles, that they in  their turn may tyrannise over the merchants, and they again over all the  workmen of their shops and bazaars.    Over their own servants (for thus they call the slaves, that the word  itself may not be used), who work upon their estates, the nobles are  absolute masters, and may even hang them upon the nearest tree. And here  I cannot but remark how strange it is, first, that any man can remain a  slave rather than die; and secondly, how much stranger it is that any  other man, himself a slave, can be found to hunt down or to hang his  fellow; yet the tyrants never lack executioners. Their castles are  crowded with retainers who wreak their wills upon the defenceless. These  retainers do not wear the brazen bracelet; they are free. Are there,  then, no beggars? Yes, they sit at every corner, and about the gates of  the cities, asking for alms.    Though begging makes a man forfeit to the State, it is only when he has  thews and sinews, and can work. The diseased and aged, the helpless and  feeble, may break the law, and starve by the roadside, because it  profits no one to make them his slaves. And all these things are done in  the name of morality, and for the good of the human race, as they  constantly announce in their councils and parliaments.    There are two reasons why the mercenaries have been called in; first,  because the princes found the great nobles so powerful, and can keep  them in check only by the aid of these foreigners; and secondly, because  the number of the outlaws in the woods has become so great that the  nobles themselves are afraid lest their slaves should revolt, and, with  the aid of the outlaws, overcome them.    Now the mark of a noble is that he can read and write. When the ancients  were scattered, the remnant that was left behind was, for the most part,  the ignorant and the poor. But among them there was here and there a man  who possessed some little education and force of mind. At first there  was no order; but after thirty years or so, after a generation, some  order grew up, and these men, then become aged, were naturally chosen as  leaders. They had, indeed, no actual power then, no guards or armies;  but the common folk, who had no knowledge, came to them for decision of  their disputes, for advice what to do, for the pronouncement of some  form of marriage, for the keeping of some note of property, and to be  united against a mutual danger.    These men in turn taught their children to read and write, wishing that  some part of the wisdom of the ancients might be preserved. They  themselves wrote down what they knew, and these manuscripts, transmitted  to their children, were saved with care. Some of them remain to this  day. These children, growing to manhood, took more upon them, and  assumed higher authority as the past was forgotten, and the original  equality of all men lost in antiquity. The small enclosed farms of their  fathers became enlarged to estates, the estates became towns, and thus,  by degrees, the order of the nobility was formed. As they intermarried  only among themselves, they preserved a certain individuality. At this  day a noble is at once known, no matter how coarsely he may be dressed,  or how brutal his habits, by his delicacy of feature, his air of  command, even by his softness of skin and fineness of hair.    Still the art of reading and writing is scrupulously imparted to all  their legitimate offspring, and scrupulously confined to them alone. It  is true that they do not use it except on rare occasions when necessity  demands, being wholly given over to the chase, to war, and politics, but  they retain the knowledge. Indeed, were a noble to be known not to be  able to read and write, the prince would at once degrade him, and the  sentence would be upheld by the entire caste. No other but the nobles  are permitted to acquire these arts; if any attempt to do so, they are  enslaved and punished. But none do attempt; of what avail would it be to  them?    All knowledge is thus retained in the possession of the nobles; they do  not use it, but the physicians, for instance, who are famous, are so  because by favour of some baron, they have learned receipts in the  ancient manuscripts which have been mentioned. One virtue, and one only,  adorns this exclusive caste; they are courageous to the verge of  madness. I had almost omitted to state that the merchants know how to  read and write, having special license and permits to do so, without  which they may not correspond. There are few books, and still fewer to  read them; and these all in manuscript, for though the way to print is  not lost, it is not employed since no one wants books.          CHAPTER V    THE LAKE      There now only remains the geography of our country to be treated of  before the history is commenced. Now the most striking difference  between the country as we know it and as it was known to the ancients is  the existence of the great Lake in the centre of the island. From the  Red Rocks (by the Severn) hither, the most direct route a galley can  follow is considered to be about 200 miles in length, and it is a  journey which often takes a week even for a vessel well manned, because  the course, as it turns round the islands, faces so many points of the  compass, and therefore the oarsmen are sure to have to labour in the  teeth of the wind, no matter which way it blows.    Many parts are still unexplored, and scarce anything known of their  extent, even by repute. Until Felix Aquila's time, the greater portion,  indeed, had not even a name.

Double doors of sheet-iron are made at  the bottom and near the tops, by which it is either filled or emptied, and  a few air-holes (B), which may be stopped with loose bricks, left in the  bottom. The second figure shows a kiln of another shape made to burn 3,000  bushels of charcoal, or about 80 cords of wood. The shape is a  parallelogram, having an arched roof, and it is strengthened by a  framework of timber 10 inches square. As the pressure of the gas is  sometimes very great, the walls must be built a brick and a half thick to  prevent their bursting. The usual size is 16 feet wide and high, and 40  feet in length, outside measure. The time occupied in filling, burning,  and emptying a small cone is about three weeks, and four weeks is required  for the larger ones.--_The Gardeners' Chronicle._    [Illustration: KILN FOR BURNING CHARCOAL.]           *       *       *       *       *          ENTRANCE, TIDDINGTON HOUSE, OXON.      Our illustration is a view of the entrance facade to Tiddington House,  Oxfordshire, the residence of the Rev. Joshua Bennett. The house is an old  building of the Georgian period, and though originally plain and  unpretentious, its bold coved cornices under the eaves, its rubbed and  shaped arches, moulded strings, and thick sash bars, made it of  considerable interest to the admirers of the \"Queen Anne\" school of  architecture, and led to the adoption of that style in the alterations and  additions made last year, of which the work shown in our illustration  formed a small part. Between the \"entrance facade\" and the wall of the  house there is a space of some twenty feet in length, which is inclosed by  a substantially built conservatory-like erection of Queen Anne design,  forming an outer hall.    [Illustration: ENTRANCE TIDDINGTON HOUSE OXON.--Morris &  Stallwood--Architects.]    The works were executed by Messrs. Holly & Butler, of Nettlebed. The brick  carving was beautifully done by the late Mr. Finlay; and the architects  were Messrs. Morris & Stallwood, of Reading.--_The Architect._           *       *       *       *       *          NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE BICHROMATE OF POTASH PILE.      Since Poggendorff in 1842 thought of substituting in the Bunsen battery a  solution of bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid for nitric acid, and  of thus making a single liquid pile of it, in suppressing the porous  vessel, his idea has been taken up a considerable number of times. Some  rediscovered it simply, while others, who were better posted in regard to  the work of their predecessors, took Poggendorff's pile as he conceived  it, and, considering the future that was in store for it, thought only of  modifying it in order to render it better. Among these, Mr. Grenet was one  of the first to present the bichromate of potash pile under a truly  practical form. As long ago as 1856, in fact, he gave it the form that is  still in use, and that is known as the bottle pile. Thus constructed, this  pile, as is well known, presents a feeble internal resistance, and a  greater electro-motive power than the Bunsen element. Unfortunately, its  energy rapidly decreases, and the alteration of the liquid, as well as the  large deposit of oxide of chromium that occurs on the positive electrode,  prevents its being employed in experiments of quite long duration. Mr.  Grenet, it is true, obviated these two defects by first renewing the  liquid slowly and continuously, and causing a current of air to bubble up  in the pile so as to detach the oxide of chromium in measure as the  deposit formed. Thus improved, the bichromate pile was employed on a large  scale in the lighting of the Comptoir d'Escompte. In an extensive  application like this latter, the use of compressed air for renewing the  liquid can be easily adapted to the bichromate pile, as the number of  elements is great enough to allow of the putting in of all the piping  necessary; but when it is only desired to use this pile for laboratory  purposes, and when there is need of but a small number of elements, it is  impossible to adopt Mr. Grenet's elements in the form required by an  electric lighting installation. It becomes absolutely necessary, then, to  come back to a simpler form, and attempt at the same time to obviate the  defects which are inherent to its very principle. In accordance with this  idea, it will be well to point out the arrangement adopted by Mr. Courtot  for his bichromate of potash piles--an arrangement that is very simple,  but, sufficiently well worked out to render the use of it convenient in a  laboratory.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--COURTOT'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE BICHROMATE PILE.]    Fig. 1 gives the most elementary form. It consists of an earthen vessel  into which dip four carbon plates connected with each other by a copper  ring which carries one of the terminals. In the center there is a  cylindrical porous vessel that contains a very dilute and feebly  acidulated solution of bichromate of potash into which dips a prism of  zinc, which may be lifted by means of a rod when the pile ceases to  operate. It is true that the presence of the porous vessel in the  bichromate of potash element increases the internal resistance, but, as an  offset, although it decreases the discharge, it secures constancy and  quite a long duration for it.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--COURTOT'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE BICHROMATE PILE.]    The elements thus constituted may be grouped, to the number of six, in a  frame analogous to that shown in the engraving, and, sum total, form a  small sized battery adapted to the current experiments of the laboratory,  and capable of supplying two small four volt lamps for ten or twelve  hours. We have had occasion to make use of these elements for the  graduation of galvanometers, and, after ascertaining the constancy of the  discharge, have found that the internal resistance of each couple is  nearly 0.175 ohm, with an electro-motive force of two volts. As may be  seen, these elements should, in general, all be mounted for tension, as  they are in the figure, inasmuch as the mobility of the zincs permits,  according to circumstances, of employing a variable number of them without  changing anything. Moreover, with zincs amalgamated in a special manner,  the attack is imperceptible, and the work in open circuit need scarcely to  be taken into consideration.    Yet, despite the qualities inherent to the arrangement that we have just  described, that defect common to all bichromate of potash piles--the  deposit of oxide of chromium upon the carbon--is not here avoided. It  occurs quite slowly, to be sure, but it does occur, and, from this point  of view, the arrangement shown in Fig. 2 is preferable. The elements here  are composed of prismatic porcelain vessels containing, as before, the  solution and porous vessel.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--COURTOT'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE BICHROMATE PILE.]    The whole is covered with a sheet of ebonite connected with the zinc and  the two carbon plates in such a way that when the pile is not in operation  the whole can be lifted from the liquid. Under such circumstances the  deposit of oxide is notably diminished, and the duration of the discharge  is consequently greatly increased.    Fig. 3 shows the details of a windlass that permits of lifting, according  to circumstances, all the elements of the same trough or only a part of  them. To effect this, the drum around which the chain winds that carries  the carbons is mounted upon a sleeve fixed upon the axle. This latter is  actuated by a winch; and a ratchet wheel, R, joined to a click which is  actuated by a spiral spring, prevents the ebonite plates from falling back  when it is desired to place the bolt under the button, B, of the spring.    When it is desired to put an element out of the circuit, it is only  necessary to act with the finger upon the extremity of the lever, D. Under  the action of the latter, the piece, _s_, which carries a groove for the  passage of the screws that fix it to the upper cross-piece, takes on a  longitudinal motion and consequently gears with the drum through the  toothed sleeve, E. When an experiment is finished the zinc may thus be  lifted from the liquid, and the deposit of oxide be prevented from forming  upon the carbon. As may be seen, the arrangements which we have just  described exhibit nothing that is particularly original. The windlasses  used for removing the elements from a pile when the circuit is open have  been employed for a long time; the bichromate pile is itself old, and, as  we said in the beginning, it has been modified in its details a number of  times. In spite of this, we have thought it well to point out the mode of  construction adopted by Mr. Courtot, since, owing to the simplicity of the  arrangements, it renders convenient and easily manageable a pile of very  great constancy that may be utilized for supplying incandescent lamps, as  well as for the most varied experiments of the laboratory.--_La Lumiere  Electrique._           *       *       *       *       *          THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY BY INDUCTION.      There has been much said in recent times about the distribution of  electricity by means of induction coils, and the use of this process has  given rise to several systems that differ but little from one another in  principle.    The following are a few details in regard to a system due to a Dutch  engineer:    In the month of December, 1881, a patent relating to the distribution of  electricity was taken out in Germany and other countries by Mr. B.  Haitzema Enuma, whose system is based upon a series of successive  inductions. The primary current developed by a dynamo-electric machine  gives rise to secondary, tertiary, etc., currents. The principal line runs  through the streets parallel with their axes, and, when the arrangement of  the places is adapted thereto, it is closed upon the generator itself. In  those frequent"]]]
