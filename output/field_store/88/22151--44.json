WAGNER    To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, flatters;  'Tis honor, profit, unto me.  But I, alone, would shun these shallow matters,  Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity.  This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling  I hate,--these noises of the throng:  They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling.  And call it mirth, and call it song!      PEASANTS, UNDER THE LINDEN-TREE    (_Dance and Song_.)              All for the dance the shepherd dressed,            In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest              Himself with care arraying:            Around the linden lass and lad            Already footed it like mad:              Hurrah! hurrah!              Hurrah--tarara-la!            The fiddle-bow was playing.              He broke the ranks, no whit afraid,            And with his elbow punched a maid,              Who stood, the dance surveying:            The buxom wench, she turned and said:            \"Now, you I call a stupid-head!\"              Hurrah! hurrah!              Hurrah--tarara-la!            \"Be decent while you're staying!\"              Then round the circle went their flight,            They danced to left, they danced to right:            Their kirtles all were playing.            They first grew red, and then grew warm,            And rested, panting, arm in arm,--              Hurrah! hurrah!              Hurrah--tarara-la!            And hips and elbows straying.              Now, don't be so familiar here!            How many a one has fooled his dear,            Waylaying and betraying!              And yet, he coaxed her soon aside,            And round the linden sounded wide.              Hurrah! hurrah!              Hurrah--tarara-la!            And the fiddle-bow was playing.    OLD PEASANT    Sir Doctor, it is good of you,  That thus you condescend, to-day,  Among this crowd of merry folk,  A highly-learned man, to stray.  Then also take the finest can,  We fill with fresh wine, for your sake:  I offer it, and humbly wish  That not alone your thirst is slake,--  That, as the drops below its brink,  So many days of life you drink!      FAUST    I take the cup you kindly reach,  With thanks and health to all and each.    (_The People gather in a circle about him_.)      OLD PEASANT    In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed,  That now our day of joy you share,  Who heretofore, in evil days,  Gave us so much of helping care.  Still many a man stands living here,  Saved by your father's skillful hand,  That snatched him from the fever's rage  And stayed the plague in all the land.  Then also you, though but a youth,  Went into every house of pain:  Many the corpses carried forth,  But you in health came out again.    FAUST    No test or trial you evaded:  A Helping God the helper aided.    ALL    Health to the man, so skilled and tried.  That for our help he long may abide!    FAUST    To Him above bow down, my friends,  Who teaches help, and succor sends!    (_He goes on with_ WAGNER.)    WAGNER    With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou  Receive the people's honest veneration!  How lucky he, whose gifts his station  With such advantages endow!  Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation:  Each asks, and presses near to gaze;  The fiddle stops, the dance delays.  Thou goest, they stand in rows to see,  And all the caps are lifted high;  A little more, and they would bend the knee  As if the Holy Host came by.    FAUST    A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!--  Here from our wandering will we rest contented.  Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone,  When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented.  Here, rich in hope and firm in faith,  With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven,  The end of that far-spreading death  Entreating from the Lord of Heaven!  Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem:  Couldst thou but read, within mine inmost spirit,  How little now I deem,  That sire or son such praises merit!  My father's was a sombre, brooding brain,  Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered,  And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered  With labor whimsical, and pain:  Who, in his dusky work-shop bending,  With proved adepts in company,  Made, from his recipes unending,  Opposing substances agree.  There was a Lion red, a wooer daring,  Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused,  And both, tormented then by flame unsparing,  By turns in either bridal chamber housed.  If then appeared, with colors splendid,  The young Queen in her crystal shell,  This was the medicine--the patients' woes soon ended,  And none demanded: who got well?  Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,  Among these vales and hills surrounding,  Worse than the pestilence, have passed.  Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;  And I must hear, by all the living,  The shameless murderers praised at last!    WAGNER    Why, therefore, yield to such depression?  A good man does his honest share  In exercising, with the strictest care,  The art bequeathed to his possession!  Dost thou thy father honor, as a youth?  Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee:  Dost thou, as man, increase the stores of truth?  Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee.    FAUST    O happy he, who still renews  The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever!  That which one does not know, one needs to use;  And what one knows, one uses never.  But let us not, by such despondence, so  The fortune of this hour embitter!  Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow,  The green-embosomed houses glitter!  The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;  It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;  Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,  Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!  Then would I see eternal Evening gild  The silent world beneath me glowing,  On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled,  The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.  The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep,  Would then no more impede my godlike motion;  And now before mine eyes expands the ocean  With all its bays, in shining sleep!  Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;  The new-born impulse fires my mind,--  I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,  The Day before me and the Night behind,  Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,--  A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.  Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid  Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.  Yet in each soul is born the pleasure  Of yearning onward, upward and away,  When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure,  The lark sends down his flickering lay,--  When over crags and piny highlands  The poising eagle slowly soars,  And over plains and lakes and islands  The crane sails by to other shores.    WAGNER    I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices,  But never yet such impulse felt, as this is.  One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look,  Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us:  How otherwise the mental raptures bear us  From page to page, from book to book!  Then winter nights take loveliness untold,  As warmer life in every limb had crowned you;  And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old,  All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you!    FAUST    One impulse art thou conscious of, at best;  O, never seek to know the other!  Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,  And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.  One with tenacious organs holds in love  And clinging lust the world in its embraces;  The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,  Into the high ancestral spaces.  If there be airy spirits near,  'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing,  Let them drop down the golden atmosphere,  And bear me forth to new and varied being!  Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine,  To waft me o'er the world at pleasure,  I would not for the costliest stores of treasure--  Not for a monarch's robe--the gift resign.    WAGNER    Invoke not thus the well-known throng,  Which through the firmament diffused is faring,  And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong.  In every quarter is preparing.  Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharp  Sweep down, and with their barbed points assail you;  Then from the East they come, to dry and warp  Your lungs, till breath and being fail you:  If from the Desert sendeth them the South,  With fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning,  The West leads on a host, to cure the drouth  Only when meadow, field, and you are drowning.  They gladly hearken, prompt for injury,--  Gladly obey, because they gladly cheat us;  From Heaven they represent themselves to be,  And lisp like angels, when with lies they meet us.  But, let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all:  The air is cold, the vapors fall.  At night, one learns his house to prize:--  Why stand you thus, with such astonished eyes?  What, in the twilight, can your mind so trouble?    FAUST    Seest thou the black dog coursing there, through corn and  stubble?    WAGNER    Long since: yet deemed him not important in the least.    FAUST    Inspect him close: for what tak'st thou the beast?    WAGNER    Why, for a poodle who has lost his master,  And scents about, his track to find.    FAUST    Seest thou the spiral circles, narrowing faster,  Which he, approaching, round us seems to wind?  A streaming trail of fire, if I see rightly,  Follows his path of mystery.    WAGNER    It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly;  Naught but a plain black poodle do I see.    FAUST    It seems to me that with enchanted cunning  He snares our feet, some future chain to bind.    WAGNER    I see him timidly, in doubt, around us running,  Since, in his master's stead, two strangers doth he find.    FAUST    The circle narrows: he is near!    WAGNER    A dog thou seest, and not a phantom, here!

Anyone who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what the  wonder means--how he or she is followed about and besought in a whisper  to relate romances; how groups gather round and hang on the outskirts  of the favored party in the hope of being allowed to join in and  listen.  Sara not only could tell stories, but she adored telling them.  When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent  wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks  flushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act  and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of  her voice, the bend and sway of her slim body, and the dramatic  movement of her hands. She forgot that she was talking to listening  children; she saw and lived with the fairy folk, or the kings and  queens and beautiful ladies, whose adventures she was narrating.  Sometimes when she had finished her story, she was quite out of breath  with excitement, and would lay her hand on her thin, little,  quick-rising chest, and half laugh as if at herself.    \"When I am telling it,\" she would say, \"it doesn't seem as if it was  only made up.  It seems more real than you are--more real than the  schoolroom.  I feel as if I were all the people in the story--one after  the other.  It is queer.\"    She had been at Miss Minchin's school about two years when, one foggy  winter's afternoon, as she was getting out of her carriage, comfortably  wrapped up in her warmest velvets and furs and looking very much  grander than she knew, she caught sight, as she crossed the pavement,  of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps, and stretching its  neck so that its wide-open eyes might peer at her through the railings.  Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her  look at it, and when she looked she smiled because it was her way to  smile at people.    But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide-open eyes evidently was  afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of  importance.  She dodged out of sight like a jack-in-the-box and  scurried back into the kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she  had not been such a poor little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed  in spite of herself.  That very evening, as Sara was sitting in the  midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one  of her stories, the very same figure timidly entered the room, carrying  a coal box much too heavy for her, and knelt down upon the hearth rug  to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes.    She was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the area  railings, but she looked just as frightened.  She was evidently afraid  to look at the children or seem to be listening. She put on pieces of  coal cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing  noise, and she swept about the fire irons very softly.  But Sara saw in  two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on, and  that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here  and there. And realizing this, she raised her voice and spoke more  clearly.    \"The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal-green water, and dragged  after them a fishing-net woven of deep-sea pearls,\" she said.  \"The  Princess sat on the white rock and watched them.\"    It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince  Merman, and went to live with him in shining caves under the sea.    The small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then swept  it again.  Having done it twice, she did it three times; and, as she  was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her to  listen that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had  no right to listen at all, and also forgot everything else. She sat  down upon her heels as she knelt on the hearth rug, and the brush hung  idly in her fingers.  The voice of the storyteller went on and drew her  with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear  blue light, and paved with pure golden sands. Strange sea flowers and  grasses waved about her, and far away faint singing and music echoed.    The hearth brush fell from the work-roughened hand, and Lavinia Herbert  looked round.    \"That girl has been listening,\" she said.    The culprit snatched up her brush, and scrambled to her feet.  She  caught at the coal box and simply scuttled out of the room like a  frightened rabbit.    Sara felt rather hot-tempered.    \"I knew she was listening,\" she said.  \"Why shouldn't she?\"    Lavinia tossed her head with great elegance.    \"Well,\" she remarked, \"I do not know whether your mamma would like you  to tell stories to servant girls, but I know MY mamma wouldn't like ME  to do it.\"    \"My mamma!\" said Sara, looking odd.  \"I don't believe she would mind in  the least.  She knows that stories belong to everybody.\"    \"I thought,\" retorted Lavinia, in severe recollection, \"that your mamma  was dead.  How can she know things?\"    \"Do you think she DOESN'T know things?\" said Sara, in her stern little  voice.  Sometimes she had a rather stern little voice.    \"Sara's mamma knows everything,\" piped in Lottie.  \"So does my  mamma--'cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin's--my other one knows  everything.  The streets are shining, and there are fields and fields  of lilies, and everybody gathers them. Sara tells me when she puts me  to bed.\"    \"You wicked thing,\" said Lavinia, turning on Sara; \"making fairy  stories about heaven.\"    \"There are much more splendid stories in Revelation,\" returned Sara.  \"Just look and see!  How do you know mine are fairy stories? But I can  tell you\"--with a fine bit of unheavenly temper--\"you will never find  out whether they are or not if you're not kinder to people than you are  now.  Come along, Lottie.\"  And she marched out of the room, rather  hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere, but she  found no trace of her when she got into the hall.    \"Who is that little girl who makes the fires?\" she asked Mariette that  night.    Mariette broke forth into a flow of description.    Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle Sara might well ask.  She was a forlorn little  thing who had just taken the place of scullery maid--though, as to  being scullery maid, she was everything else besides. She blacked boots  and grates, and carried heavy coal-scuttles up and down stairs, and  scrubbed floors and cleaned windows, and was ordered about by  everybody.  She was fourteen years old, but was so stunted in growth  that she looked about twelve.  In truth, Mariette was sorry for her.  She was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if  her poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her head.    \"What is her name?\" asked Sara, who had sat by the table, with her chin  on her hands, as she listened absorbedly to the recital.    Her name was Becky.  Mariette heard everyone below-stairs calling,  \"Becky, do this,\" and \"Becky, do that,\" every five minutes in the day.    Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some time  after Mariette left her.  She made up a story of which Becky was the  ill-used heroine.  She thought she looked as if she had never had quite  enough to eat.  Her very eyes were hungry.  She hoped she should see  her again, but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or  down stairs on several occasions, she always seemed in such a hurry and  so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.    But a few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when she entered her  sitting room she found herself confronting a rather pathetic picture.  In her own special and pet easy-chair before the bright fire,  Becky--with a coal smudge on her nose and several on her apron, with  her poor little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coal box on  the floor near her--sat fast asleep, tired out beyond even the  endurance of her hard-working young body. She had been sent up to put  the bedrooms in order for the evening. There were a great many of them,  and she had been running about all day.  Sara's rooms she had saved  until the last. They were not like the other rooms, which were plain  and bare. Ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere  necessaries. Sara's comfortable sitting room seemed a bower of luxury  to the scullery maid, though it was, in fact, merely a nice, bright  little room. But there were pictures and books in it, and curious  things from India; there was a sofa and the low, soft chair; Emily sat  in a chair of her own, with the air of a presiding goddess, and there  was always a glowing fire and a polished grate.  Becky saved it until  the end of her afternoon's work, because it rested her to go into it,  and she always hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft  chair and look about her, and think about the wonderful good fortune of  the child who owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days  in beautiful hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the  area railing.    On this afternoon, when she had sat down, the sensation of relief to  her short, aching legs had been so wonderful and delightful that it had  seemed to soothe her whole body, and the glow of warmth and comfort  from the fire had crept over her like a spell, until, as she looked at  the red coals, a tired, slow smile stole over her smudged face, her  head nodded forward without her being aware of it, her eyes drooped,"]]]
