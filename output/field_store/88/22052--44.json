But as for Elizabeth--perfect in  dancing, riding, archery, and all the sports of chivalry--'she trod the  ling like a buck in spring, and she looked like a lance in rest.'    When Elizabeth succeeded Mary in the autumn of 1558 she had dire need of  all she had learnt in her twenty-five years of adventurous life.  Fortunately for herself and, on the whole, most fortunately for both  England and America, she had a remarkable power of inspiring devotion to  the service of their queen and country in men of both the cool and  ardent types; and this long after her personal charms had gone.  Government, religion, finance, defence, and foreign affairs were in a  perilous state of flux, besides which they have never been more  distractingly mixed up with one another. Henry VII had saved money for  twenty-five years. His three successors had spent it lavishly for  fifty. Henry VIII had kept the Church Catholic in ritual while making it  purely national in government. The Lord Protector Somerset had made it  as Protestant as possible under Edward VI. Mary had done her best to  bring it back to the Pope. Home affairs were full of doubts and dangers,  though the great mass of the people were ready to give their handsome  young queen a fair chance and not a little favor. Foreign affairs were  worse. France was still the hereditary enemy; and the loss of Calais  under Mary had exasperated the whole English nation. Scotland was a  constant menace in the north. Spain was gradually changing from friend  to foe. The Pope was disinclined to recognize Elizabeth at all.    To understand how difficult her position was we must remember what sort  of constitution England had when the germ of the United States was  forming. The Roman Empire was one constituent whole from the emperor  down. The English-speaking peoples of to-day form constituent wholes  from the electorate up. In both cases all parts were and are in constant  relation to the whole. The case of Elizabethan England, however, was  very different. There was neither despotic unity from above nor  democratic unity from below, but a mixed and fluctuating kind of  government in which Crown, nobles, parliament, and people formed certain  parts which had to be put together for each occasion. The accepted  general idea was that the sovereign, supreme as an individual, looked  after the welfare of the country in peace and war so far as the Crown  estates permitted; but that whenever the Crown resources would not  suffice then the sovereign could call on nobles and people for whatever  the common weal required. _Noblesse oblige_. In return for the estates  or monopolies which they had acquired the nobles and favored commoners  were expected to come forward with all their resources at every national  crisis precisely as the Crown was expected to work for the common weal  at all times. When the resources of the Crown and favored courtiers  sufficed, no parliament was called; but whenever they had to be  supplemented then parliament met and voted whatever it approved.  Finally, every English freeman was required to do his own share towards  defending the country in time of need, and he was further required to  know the proper use of arms.    The great object of every European court during early modern times was  to get both the old feudal nobility and the newly promoted commoners to  revolve round the throne as round the centre of their solar system. By  sheer force of character--for the Tudors, had no overwhelming army like  the Roman emperors'--Henry VIII had succeeded wonderfully well.  Elizabeth now had to piece together what had been broken under Edward VI  and Mary. She, too, succeeded--and with the hearty goodwill of nearly  all her subjects.    Mary had left the royal treasury deeply in debt. Yet Elizabeth succeeded  in paying off all arrears and meeting new expenditure for defence and  for the court. The royal income rose. England became immensely richer  and more prosperous than ever before. Foreign trade increased by leaps  and bounds. Home industries flourished and were stimulated by new  arrivals from abroad, because England was a safe asylum for the  craftsmen whom Philip was driving from the Netherlands, to his own great  loss and his rival's gain.    English commercial life had been slowly emerging from medieval ways  throughout the fifteenth century. With the beginning of the sixteenth  the rate of emergence had greatly quickened. The soil-bound peasant who  produced enough food for his family from his thirty acres was being  gradually replaced by the well-to-do yeoman who tilled a hundred acres  and upwards. Such holdings produced a substantial surplus for the  market. This increased the national wealth, which, in its turn,  increased both home and foreign trade. The peasant merely raised a  little wheat and barley, kept a cow, and perhaps some sheep. The yeoman  or tenant farmer had sheep enough for the wool trade besides some  butter, cheese, and meat for the nearest growing town. He began to  'garnish his cupboards with pewter and his joined beds with tapestry and  silk hangings, and his tables with carpets and fine napery.' He could  even feast his neighbors and servants after shearing day with  new-fangled foreign luxuries like dates, mace, raisins, currants, and  sugar.    But Elizabethan society presented striking contrasts. In parts of  England, the practice of engrossing and enclosing holdings was  increasing, as sheep-raising became more profitable than farming. The  tenants thus dispossessed either swelled the ranks of the vagabonds who  infested the highways or sought their livelihood at sea or in London,  which provided the two best openings for adventurous young men. The  smaller provincial towns afforded them little opportunity, for there the  trades were largely in the hands of close corporations descended from  the medieval craft guilds. These were eventually to be swept away by the  general trend of business. Their dissolution had indeed already begun;  for smart village craftsmen were even then forming the new industrial  settlements from which most of the great manufacturing towns of England  have sprung. Camden the historian found Birmingham full of ringing  anvils, Sheffield 'a town of great name for the smiths therein,' Leeds  renowned for cloth, and Manchester already a sort of cottonopolis,  though the 'cottons' of those days were still made of wool.    There was a wages question then as now. There were demands for a minimum  living wage. The influx of gold and silver from America had sent all  prices soaring. Meat became almost prohibitive for the 'submerged  tenth'--there was a rapidly submerging tenth. Beef rose from one cent a  pound in the forties to four in 1588, the year of the Armada. How would  the lowest paid of craftsmen fare on twelve cents a day, with butter at  ten cents a pound? Efforts were made, again and again, to readjust the  ratio between prices and wages. But, as a rule, prices increased much  faster than wages.    All these things--the increase of surplus hands, the high cost of  living, grievances about wages and interest--tended to make the farms  and workshops of England recruiting-grounds for the sea; and the young  men would strike out for themselves as freighters, traders, privateers,  or downright pirates, lured by the dazzling chance of great and sudden  wealth.    'The gamble of it' was as potent then as now, probably more potent  still. It was an age of wild speculation accompanied by all the usual  evils that follow frenzied ways. It was also an age of monopoly. Both  monopoly and speculation sent recruits into the sea-dog ranks. Elizabeth  would grant, say, to Sir Walter Raleigh, the monopoly of sweet wines.  Raleigh would naturally want as much sweet wine imported as England  could be induced to swallow. So, too, would Elizabeth, who got the duty.  Crews would be wanted for the monopolistic ships. They would also be  wanted for 'free-trading' vessels, that is, for the ships of the  smugglers who underbid, undersold, and tried to overreach the  monopolist, who represented law, though not quite justice. But  speculation ran to greater extremes than either monopoly or smuggling.  Shakespeare's 'Putter-out of five for one' was a typical Elizabethan  speculator exploiting the riskiest form of sea-dog trade for all--and  sometimes for more than all--that it was worth. A merchant-adventurer  would pay a capitalist, say, a thousand pounds as a premium to be  forfeited if his ship should be lost, but to be repaid by the capitalist  fivefold to the merchant if it returned. Incredible as it may seem to  us, there were shrewd money-lenders always ready for this sort of deal  in life--or life-and-death--insurance: an eloquent testimony to the  risks encountered in sailing unknown seas in the midst of well-known  dangers.    Marine insurance of the regular kind was, of course, a very different  thing. It was already of immemorial age, going back certainly to  medieval and probably to very ancient times. All forms of insurance on  land are mere mushrooms by comparison. Lloyd's had not been heard of.  But there were plenty of smart Elizabethan underwriters already  practising the general principles which were to be formally adopted two  hundred years later, in 1779, at Lloyd's Coffee House. A policy taken  out on the _Tiger_ immortalized by Shakespeare would serve as a model  still. And what makes it all the more interesting is that the  Elizabethan underwriters calculated the _Tiger's_ chances at the very  spot where the association known as Lloyd's transacts its business  to-day, the Royal Exchange in London. This, in turn, brings Elizabeth  herself upon the scene; for when she visited the Exchange, which Sir  Thomas Gresham had built to let the merchants do their street work under  cover, she immediately grasped its full significance and 'caused it by  an Herald"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12873"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

And  this figure was----but I need add no more; the reader must by this  time have fully anticipated my discovery.    That night I started from Bologne. I could no more have endured to  stop there, conscious that the town contained my persecutor, than I  could have flown. Accordingly, after a hurried breakfast, I  proceeded to arrange what little business I had to transact; and  this completed, away I posted to the well-known shop of Monsieur  ----, dentist, perruquier, and general agent to the steam-packet  company. Fortunately the little man was at home, and received me  with his usual courtesy. He was very, very sorry that he could not  stay to converse with me, but a patient in the inner parlour  required his immediate attendance; he must therefore--. I  entreated him not to apologize; my business was simple--it was  merely to ascertain at what hour the first packet sailed; and having  so said, and received a satisfactory reply, I prepared to quit the  shop, when just as I was turning round to shut the door, I caught a  glimpse through the half-closed curtains that shaded the inner room  of a cheek and one eye. The cheek was swollen, and a solitary patch  of snuff rested, like a fly, upon its surface. It was the Mysterious  Tailor; he had come in to have his tooth pulled out.    Notwithstanding my anxiety to quit Bologne, it was evening before I  was on board the packet; nor did I feel myself at ease, until the  heights had dwindled to a speck, and the loud carols of the  fishermen returning home from their day's sport, had sunk into a  faint, undistinguished whisper. Our vessel's course for the first  hour or so was delightful. Towards night, the weather, which had  hitherto proved so serene, began to fluctuate; the wind shifted, and  gradually a heavy swell came rolling in from the north-east towards  us. As the hour advanced, a storm seemed advancing with it; and a  hundred symptoms appeared, the least of which was fully sufficient  to certify the coming on of a tremendous hurricane. Our captain,  however--a bronzed, pinched-up little fellow, whom a series of  north-westers seemed to have dried to a mummy--put a good face on  the matter, and our mate whistled bluffly, though I could not help  fancying that his whistle had something forced about it.    We had by this time been tossing about upwards of four hours, yet  despite the storm, which increased every moment in energy, our  vessel bore up well, labouring and pitching frightfully to be sure,  but as yet uninjured in sail, mast, or hull. As for her course, it  was--so the mate assured me--\"a moral impossible to say which way we  were bound, whether for a trip to Spain, Holland, or Van Dieman's  Land; it might be one, it might be t'other.\" Scarcely had he uttered  these words, when a long rolling sea came sweeping on in hungry  grandeur towards us, and at one rush tore open the ship's gun-wale,  which now, completely at the mercy of the wave, went staggering,  drunken, and blindfold, through the surge. From this fatal moment  the sailors were kept constantly at the pumps, although so  instantaneous was the rush of water into the hold, that they did  little or no good; there seemed, in fact, not the ghost of a chance  left us; even the mate had ceased whistling, and the captain's oaths  began to assume the nature of a compromise between penitence and  hardihood.    It was now midnight, deep, awful midnight; the few remaining  passengers had left the deck and retreated into a bed which they  shared in common with the salt water. The Captain stood, like one  bewildered, beside the helm, while I lay stretched along the  forecastle, watching, as well as I could, the tremendous rushing of  the waves. It was during a partial hush of the storm, when the wind,  as if out of breath, was still, that a shifting light attached  to some moving body, came bearing down full upon us.    \"This is an ugly night, sir,\" said the Captain, who now, for the  first time, found words, \"yet methinks I see a sail a-head.\"    \"Surely not,\" I replied, \"no earthly vessel but our own can live on  such a sea.\"    Scarcely had the words escaped me, when \"helm a lee!\" was roared out  in a loud emphatic tone, something between rage and fright.    The captain strove to turn his helm, but in vain, the rudder had  lost all power. At this instant, a rushing sound swept past us, and  the two ships came in direct contact with each other. The crash was  tremendous: down with a dizzy spinning motion went the strange  vessel; one yell--but one shrill piercing yell, which is ever  sounding in my ears, ensued--a pause, and all was over.    My heart died within me at that cry; an icy shudder crept through  me, every hair of my head seemed endowed with separate vitality. To  go down into the tomb--and such a tomb!--unwept, unknown, the very  lights from the English coast still discernible in distance, yet not  a friend to hold forth aid; the idea was inexpressibly awful. Just  at this crisis, while grasping the bannister with weak hands, I lay  faint and hopeless on the deck, I fancied I saw a dark figure  crawling up the cabin-steps towards me. I listened; the sound drew  near, the form advanced, already it touched that part of the  staircase to which I clung. Was it the phantom of one of those  wretches who had just met death? Had it come fresh from eternity,  the taint of recent earth yet hanging about it, to warn me of my own  departure? A sudden vivid flash enabled me to dispel all doubt; the  dull, grey eye, and thin furrowed form, were not to be so mistaken;  the voice too--but why prolong the mystery? it was my old  unforgotten persecutor, the Mysterious Tailor of High Holborn. What  followed I know not: overpowered by previous excitement, and the  visitation of this infernal phantom, my brain spun round--my heart  ticked audibly like a clock--my tongue glued to my mouth--I sank  senseless at the cabin door.    _(To be concluded in our next.)_                     *       *       *       *       *        SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS    NORFOLK PUNCH.
