The two princes and the two princesses, seated beside them,  taking care of them, were most exposed to view.  The Duke of Burgundy  wept, from feeling and in good faith, with an air of gentleness, tears of  nature, of piety, and of patience.  The Duke of Berry, in quite as good  faith, shed abundance, but tears, so to speak, of blood, so great  appeared to be their bitterness; he gave forth not sobs, but shrieks,  howls.  The Duchess of Berry (daughter of the Duke of Orleans) was beside  herself.  The bitterest despair was depicted on her face.  She saw her  sister-in-law, who was so hateful to her, all at once raised to that  title, that rank of dauphiness, which were about to place so great a  distance between them.  Her frenzy of grief was not from affection, but  from interest; she would wrench herself from it to sustain her husband,  to embrace him, to console him, then she would become absorbed in herself  again with a torrent of tears, which helped her to stifle her shrieks.  The Duke of Orleans wept in his own corner, actually sobbing, a thing  which, had I not seen it, I should never have believed,\" adds St.  Simon,  who detested Monseigneur, and had as great a dread of his reigning as the  Duke of Orleans had.  \"Madame, re-dressed in full dress, in the middle of  the night, arrived regularly howling, not quite knowing why either one or  the other; inundating them all with her tears as she embraced them, and  making the castle resound with a renewal of shrieks, when the king's  carriages were announced, on his return to Marly.\"  The Duchess of  Burgundy was awaiting him on the road.  She stepped down and went to the  carriage window.  \"What are you about, Madame?\" exclaimed Madame de  Maintenon; \"do not come near us, we are infectious.\"  The king did not  embrace her, and she went back to the palace, but only to be at Marly  next morning before the king was awake.    The king's tears were as short as they had been abundant.  He lost a son  who was fifty years old, the most submissive and most respectful creature  in the world, ever in awe of him and obedient to him, gentle and  good-natured, a proper man amid all his indolence and stupidity, brave  and even brilliant at head of an army.  In 1688, in front of Philipsburg,  the soldiers had given him the name of \"Louis the Bold.\"  He was full of  spirits and always ready, \"revelling in the trenches,\" says Vauban.  The  Duke of Montausier, his boyhood's strict governor, had written to him,  \"Monseigneur, I do not make you my compliments on the capture of  Philipsburg; you had a fine army, shells, cannon, and Vauban.  I do not  make them to you either on your bravery; it is an hereditary virtue in  your house; but I congratulate you on being open-handed, humane,  generous, and appreciative of the services of those who do well; that is  what I make you my compliments upon.\"  \"Did not I tell you so?\" proudly  exclaimed the Chevalier de Grignan, formerly attached (as menin) to the  person of Monseigneur, on hearing his master's exploits lauded; \"for my  part, I am not surprised.\"  Racine had exaggerated the virtues of  Monseigneur in the charming verses of the prologue of Esther:              \"Thou givest him a son, an ever ready aid,            Apt or to woo or fight, obey or be obeyed;            A son who, like his sire, drags victory in his train,            Yet boasts but one desire, that father's heart to gain;            A son, who to his will submits with loving air,            Who brings upon his foes perpetual despair.            As the swift spirit flies, stern Equity's envoy,            So, when the king says, 'Go,' down rusheth he in joy,            With vengeful thunderbolt red ruin doth complete,            Then tranquilly returns to lay it at his feet.\"    In 1690 and in 1691 he had gained distinction as well as in 1688.  \"The  dauphin has begun as others would think it an honor to leave off,\" the  Prince of Orange had said, \"and, for my part, I should consider that I  had worthily capped anything great I may have done in war if, under  similar circumstances, I had made so fine a march.\"  Whether it were  owing to indolence or court cabal, Monseigneur had no more commands;  he had no taste for politics, and always sat in silence at the council,  to which the king had formally admitted him at thirty years of age,  \"instructing him,\" says the Marquis of Sourches, \"with so much vigor and  affection, that Monseigneur could not help falling at his feet to testify  his respect and gratitude.\"  Twice, at grave conjunctures, the  grand-dauphin allowed his voice to be heard; in 1685, to offer a timid  opposition to the Edict of Nantes, and, in 1700, to urge very vigorously  the acceptance of the King of Spain's will.  \"I should be enchanted,\" he  cried, as if with a prophetic instinct of his own destiny, \"to be able to  say all my life, 'The king my father, and the king my SON.'\"  Heavy in  body as well as mind, living on terms of familiarity with a petty court,  probably married to Mdlle. Choin, who had been for a long time installed  in his establishment at Meudon, Monseigneur, often embarrassed and made  uncomfortable by the austere virtue of the Duke of Burgundy, and finding  more attraction in the Duke of Berry's frank geniality, had surrendered  himself, without intending it, to the plots which were woven about him.  \"His eldest son behaved to him rather as a courtier than as a son,  gliding over the coldness shown him with a respect and a gentleness  which, together, would have won over any father less a victim to  intrigue.  The Duchess of Burgundy, in spite of her address and her  winning grace, shared her husband's disfavor.\"  The Duchess of Berry had  counted upon this to establish her sway in a reign which the king's great  age seemed to render imminent; already, it was said, the chief amusement  at Monseigneur's was to examine engravings of the coronation ceremony,  when death carried him off suddenly on the 14th of April, 1711, to the  consternation of the lower orders, who loved him because of his  reputation for geniality.  The severity of the new dauphin caused some  little dread.    \"Here is a prince who will succeed me before long,\" said the king on  presenting his grandson to the assembly of the clergy; \"by his virtue and  piety he will render the church still more flourishing, and the kingdom  more happy.\"  That was the hope of all good men.  Fenelon, in his exile  in Cambrai, and the Dukes of Beauvilliers and Chevreuse, at court, began  to feel themselves all at once transported to the heights with the prince  whom they had educated, and who had constantly remained faithful to them.  The delicate foresight and prudent sagacity of Fenelon had a long while  ago sought to prepare his pupil for the part which he was about to play.  It was piety alone that had been able to triumph over the dangerous  tendencies of a violent and impassioned temperament.  Fenelon, who had  felt this, saw also the danger of devoutness carried too far.  \"Religion  does not consist in a scrupulous observance of petty formalities,\" he  wrote to the Duke of Burgundy; \"it consists, for everybody, in the  virtues proper to one's condition.  A great prince ought not to serve  God in the same way as a hermit or a simple individual.\"    \"The prince thinks too much and acts too little,\" he said to the Duke of  Chevreuse; \"his most solid occupations are confined to vague applications  of his mind and barren resolutions; he must see society, study it, mix in  it, without becoming a slave to it, learn to express himself forcibly,  and acquire a gentle authority.  If he do not feel the need of possessing  firmness and nerve, he will not make any real progress; it is time for  him to be a man.  The life of the region in which he lives is a life of  effeminacy, indolence, timidity, and amusement.  He will never be so true  a servant to the king and to Monseigneur as when he makes them see that  they have in him a man matured, full of application, firm, impressed with  their true interests, and fitted to aid them by the wisdom of his  counsels and the vigor of his conduct.  Let him be more and more little  in the hands of God, but let him become great in the eyes of men; it is  his duty to make virtue, combined with authority, loved, feared, and  respected.\"    Court-perfidy dogged the Duke of Burgundy to the very head of the army  over which the king had set him; Fenelon, always correctly informed, had  often warned him of it.  The duke wrote to him, in 1708, on the occasion  of his dissensions with VendOme: \"It is true that I have experienced a  trial within the last fortnight, and I am far from having taken it as I  ought, allowing myself to give way to an oppression of the heart caused  by the blackenings, the contradictions, and the pains of irresolution,  and the fear of doing something untoward in a matter of extreme  importance to the State.  As for what you say to me about my indecision,  it is true that I myself reproach myself for it, and I pray God every day  to give me, together with wisdom and prudence, strength and courage to  carry out what I believe to be my duty.\"  He had no more commands, in  spite of his entreaties to obtain, in 1709, permission to march against  the enemy.  \"If money is short, I will go without any train,\" he said;  \"I will live like a simple officer; I will eat, if need be, the bread of  a common soldier, and none will complain of lacking superfluities when I  have scarcely necessaries.\"  It was at the very time when the Archbishop  of Cambrai was urgent for peace to be made at any price.  \"The people no  longer live like human beings,\" he said, in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12014"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume IV. (#7)"],[1," to form a piece so finely turned, and at such  an hour; when death was just before him, and he was too weak to  transcribe it himself.    Mr. Pope, in a letter to Mr. Hughes's brother, written soon after his  death, in answer to one received from him, with the printed copy of  the play, has the following pathetic passage.    'I read over again your brother's play, with more concern and sorrow,  than I ever felt in the reading any Tragedy. The real loss of a good  man may be called a distress to the world, and ought to affect us  more, than any feigned distress, how well drawn soever. I am glad  of an occasion of giving you under my hand this testimony, both how  excellent I think this work to be, and how excellent I thought the  author.'    It is generally allowed that the characters in this play are finely  varied and distinguished; that the sentiments are just, and  well adapted to the characters; that it abounds with beautiful  descriptions, apt allusions to the manners, and opinions of the times  where the scene is laid, and with noble morals; that the diction is  pure, unaffected, and sublime; and that the plot is conducted in a  simple and clear manner.    Some critics have objected, that there is not a sufficient ground  and foundation, for the distress in the fourth and fifth acts. That  Phocyas only assists the enemy to take Damascus a few days sooner,  than it must unavoidably have fallen into the hands of the Saracens  by a capitulation, which was far from dishonourable. If Phocyas is  guilty, his guilt must consist in this only, that he performed the  same action from a sense of his own wrong, and to preserve the idol  of his soul from violation, and death, which he might have performed  laudably, upon better principles. But this (say they) seems not  sufficient ground for those strong and stinging reproaches he casts  upon himself, nor for Eudocia's rejecting him with so much severity.  It would have been a better ground of distress, considering the  frailty of human nature, and the violent temptations he lay under; if  he had been at last prevailed upon to profess himself a Mahometan: For  then his remorse, and self-condemnation, would have been natural, his  punishment just, and the character of Eudocia placed in a more amiable  light. In answer to these objections, and in order to do justice to  the judgment of Mr. Hughes, we must observe, that he formed his play  according to the plan here recommended: but, over-persuaded by some  friends, he altered it as it now stands.    When our author was but in the nineteenth year of his age, he wrote  a Tragedy, entitled, Amalasont Queen of the Goths, which displays  a fertile genius, and a masterly invention. Besides these poetical  productions Mr. Hughes is author of several works in prose,  particularly, The Advices from Parnassus, and the Poetical Touchstone  of Trajano Boccalini, translated by several hands, were printed  in folio 1706. This translation was revised and corrected, and the  preface to it was written by Mr. Hughes.    Fontenelle's Dialogues of the Dead, translated by our author; with two  original Dialogues, published in the year 1708. The greatest part of  this had lain by him for six years.    Fontenelle's Discourse concerning the ancients, and moderns, are  printed with his conversations with a Lady, on the Plurality of  Worlds, translated by Glanville.    The History of the Revolutions in Portugal, written in French, by  Monsieur L'Abbe de Vertot, was translated by Mr. Hughes.    The Translation of the Letters of Abelard and Heloise, was done by Mr.  Hughes; upon which Mr. Pope has built his beautiful Epistle of Heloise  to Abelard.    As Mr. Hughes was an occasional contributor to the Tatler, Spectator,  and Guardian, the reader perhaps may be curious to know more  particularly what share he had in those papers, which are so justly  admired in all places in the world, where taste and genius have  visited. As it is the highest honour to have had any concern in  works like these, so it would be most injurious to the memory of this  excellent genius, not to particularize his share in them.    In the Tatler he writ,      Vol. II. Numb. 64. A Letter signed Josiah Couplet.             Numb. 73. A Letter against Gamesters,              signed William Trusty.    Mr. Tickell alludes to this Letter, in a Copy of Verses addressed to  the Spectator, Vol. VII. No. 532.      From Felon Gamesters, the raw squire is free,    And Briton owes her rescued oaks to thee.      Numb. 113. The Inventory of a Beau.      In the Spectator.      Vol. I. Numb. 33. A Letter on the Art of improving                      beauty.            Numb. 53. A Second Letter on the same                      subject.            Numb. 66. Two Letters concerning fine                      breeding.      Vol. II. Numb. 91. The History of Honoria, or                       the Rival Mother.             Numb. 104. A Letter on Riding-Habits for                        Ladies.             Numb. 141. Remarks on a Comedy, intitled                        the Lancashire-Witches.      Vol. III. Numb. 210. On the immortality of the                         Soul.              Numb. 220. A Letter concerning expedients                         for Wit.              Numb. 230. All, except the last Letter.              Numb. 231. A Letter on the awe of appearing                         before public assemblies.              Numb. 237. On Divine Providence.      Vol. IV. Numb. 252. A Letter on the Eloquence of                        Tears, and fainting fits.             Numb. 302. The Character of Emilia.             Numb. 311. A Letter from the Father of                        a great Fortune.      Vol. V. Numb. 57. A Picture of Virtue in Distress.    Vol. VII. Numb. 525. On Conjugal Love.              Numb. 537. On the Dignity of Human                         Nature.              Numb. 541. Rules for Pronunciation and                         Action, chiefly collected from Cicero.    Vol. VII. Numb. 554. On the Improvement of the Genius, illustrated  in the characters of Lord Bacon, Mr. Boyle, Sir Isaac Newton, and  Leonardo da Vinci.--We have not been able to learn, what papers in  the Guardian were written by him, besides Number 37, Vol. I. which  contains Remarks on the Tragedy of Othello.    In the year 1715 Mr. Hughes published a very accurate edition of the  works of our famous poet Edmund Spenser, in six volumes, 12mo. to  this edition are prefixed the Life of Spenser; an Essay on Allegorical  poetry; Remarks on the Fairy Queen; on the Shepherd's Calendar, and  other writings of Spenser; and a Glossary explaining the Old and  obsolete Words.    In 1718 he published a piece called Charon, or The Ferry-Boat, a  Vision. This, and Mr. Walsh's AEsculapius, or Hospital of Fools, are  perhaps two of the finest dialogues we have in English, as well as the  most lively imitations of Lucian.    Sir Richard Steele, in a paper called The Theatre, No. 15. has paid a  tribute to the memory of Mr. Hughes, with which as it illustrates his  amiable character, we shall conclude his life.    'I last night (says he) saw the Siege of Damascus, and had the  mortification to hear this evening that Mr. Hughes, the author of it,  departed this life within some few hours after his play was acted,  with universal applause. This melancholy circumstance recalled into  my thought a speech in the tragedy, which very much affected the  whole audience, and was attended to with the greatest, and most solemn  instance of approbation, and awful silence.' The incidents of the  play plunge a heroic character into the last extremity; and he is  admonished by a tyrant commander to expect no mercy, unless he changes  the Christian religion for the Mahometan. The words with which the  Turkish general makes his exit from his prisoner are,      Farewel, and think of death.    Upon which the captive breaks into the following soliloquy,      Farewel! and think of death!--was it not so?    Do murtherers then, preach morality?    But how to think of what the living know not,    And the dead cannot, or else may not tell!    What art thou? O thou great mysterious terror!    The way to thee, we know; diseases, famine,    Sword, fire, and all thy ever open gates,    That day and night stand ready to receive us.    But what, beyond them? who will draw that veil?    Yet death's not there.----No, 'tis a point of time;    The verge 'twixt mortal, and immortal Being.    It mocks our thought----On this side all is life;    And when we've reach'd it, in that very instant,    'Tis past the thinking of----O if it be    The pangs, the throes, the agonizing struggle,    When soul and body part, sure I have felt it!    And there's no more to fear.    'The gentleman (continues Sir Richard) to whose memory I devote this  paper, may be the emulation of more persons of different talents,  than any one I have ever known. His head, hand, or heart, was always  employed in something worthy imitation; his pencil, his bow (string)  or his pen, each of which he used in a masterly manner, were always  directed to raise, and entertain his own mind, or that of others, to a  more chearful prosecution of what is noble and virtuous. Peace be with  thy remains, thou amiable spirit! but I talk in the language of our  weakness, that is flown to the regions of immortality, and relieved  from the aking engine and painful instrument of anguish and sorrow,  in which for many tedious years he panted with a lively hope for his  present condition.' We shall consign the trunk, in which he was so  long imprisoned, to common earth, with all that is due to the merit of  its inhabitant[A].    [Footnote A: There are several copies of verses written to the memory  of Mr. Hughes, prefixed to Mr. Duncomb's edition of his poems, of  which one by a lady who has withheld her name, deserves particular  distinction.]           *       *       *       *       *          MATTHEW PRIOR, Esq; "]]]
