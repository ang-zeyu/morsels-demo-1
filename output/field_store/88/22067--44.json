When  this is done, and a vowel sound whispered, a distinctly resonant note can  be heard. Helmholtz and a number of distinguished German physicists and  physiologists have analysed the vowel sounds in the whispering voice and  obtained very different results. If their experiments show nothing else,  they certainly indicate that there are no universally fixed resonances for  any particular vowel sound. Some of the discrepancies may (as Aikin points  out) be due to the conditions of the experiment not being conducted under  the same conditions. Aikin, indeed, asserts that if the directions given  above be fulfilled, there will be variations between full-grown men and  women of one or two tones, and between different men and different women of  one or two semi-tones, and not much more. As he truly affirms, if the tube  is six inches long a variation of three-quarters of an inch could only make  a difference of a whole tone in the resonance, and he implies that the  different results obtained by these different experimenters were due to the  faulty use of the resonator.    In ordinary conversation much faulty pronunciation is overlooked so long as  the words themselves are intelligible, but in singing and public speaking  every misuse of the resonator is magnified and does not pass unnoticed.  Increased loudness of the voice will not improve its carrying power if the  resonator is improperly used; it will often lead to a rise of pitch and the  production of a harsh, shrill tone associated with a sense of strain and  effort. Aikin claims that by studying the whispering voice we can find for  every vowel sound that position of the resonator which gives us the maximum  of resonance. By percussing[A] the resonator in the position for the  production of the various vowel sounds you will observe a distinct  difference in the pitch of the note produced. I will first produce the  vowel sound _oo_ and proceed with the vowel sounds to _i_; you will observe  that the pitch rises an octave; that this is due to the changes in the form  of the resonator is shown when I percuss the resonator in the position of  the different vowel sounds. You will observe that I start the scale of C  with _oo_ on f and proceed through a series of vowel sounds as in  whispering _who_, _owe_, _or_, _on_, _ah_. I rise a fifth from f to c, and  the diagram shows the change in the form of the resonator cavity to be  mainly due to the position of the dorsum of the tongue. Proceeding from  _ah_ to the middle tone of the speaking register, we ascend the scale to  _i_ as in _me_, and the dorsum of the tongue now reaches the roof of the  mouth; but the tongue not only rises, it comes forward, and the front  segment of the resonator is made a little smaller at every step of the  scale while the back segment becomes a little larger. I consider this  diagram of Aikin to be more representative of the changes in the resonator  than the description of Helmholtz, who stated that the form of the  resonator during the production of the vowel sound _u_ and _o_ is that of a  globular flask with a short neck; during the production of _a_ that of a  funnel with the wide extremity directed forward; of _e_ and _i_ that of a  globular flask with a long narrow neck.    [Footnote A: This was done by the lecturer placing his left forefinger on  the outside of the right cheek, then striking it with the tip of the middle  finger of the right hand, just in the same way as he would percuss the  chest.--F.W.M.]    [Illustration: FIG. 13 I & II To face page 47]    [Description: FIG. 13.--Diagram after Aikin.    1. To show position of tongue and lips in the production of the vowel  sounds _a, o, oo_.    2. To show successive positions of the tongue in the production of the  vowel sounds _a, ei, e, i_.]    I have already said that Helmholtz showed that each vowel sound has its  particular overtones, and the quality or \"timbre\" of the voice depends upon  the proportional strength of these overtones. Helmholtz was able by means  of resonators to find out what were the overtones for each vowel sound when  a particular note was sung. The flame manometer of Koenig (_vide_ fig. 14)  shows that if the same note be sung with different vowels the serrated  flame image in the mirror is different for each vowel, and if a more  complicated form of this instrument be used (such as I show you in a  picture on the screen) the overtones of the vowel sounds can be analysed.  You will observe that this instrument consists of a number of resonators  placed in front of a series of membranes which cover capsules, each capsule  being connected with a jet of gas.    [Illustration: FIG. 14    Four-sided revolving mirror    Images of gas jets    Resonators, with capsules connected with gas jets]    [Description: FIG. 14.--Koenig's flame manometer. The fundamental note C is  sung on a vowel sound in front of the instrument; the lowest resonator is  proper to that note and the air in it is thrown into corresponding periodic  rhythmical vibrations, which are communicated through an intervening  membrane to the gas in the capsule at the back of the resonator; but the  gas is connected with the lighted jet, the flame of which is reflected in  the mirror, the result being that the flame vibrates. When the mirror is  made to revolve by turning the handle the reflected image shows a number of  teeth corresponding to the number of vibrations produced by the note which  was sung. The remaining resonators of the harmonic series with their  capsules and gas-jets respond in the same manner to the overtones proper to  each vowel sound when the fundamental note is sung.]    Each resonator corresponds from below upwards to the harmonics of the  fundamental note c. In order to know if the sound of the voice contains  harmonics and what they are, it is necessary to sing the fundamental note c  on some particular vowel sound; the resonators corresponding to the  particular harmonics of the vowel sound are thus set in action, and a  glance at the revolving mirror shows which particular gas jets vibrate.  Experiments conducted with this instrument show that the vowel _U=oo_ is  composed of the fundamental note very strong and the third harmonic (viz.  g) is fairly pronounced.    _O_ (_on_) contains the fundamental note, the second harmonic (the octave  c') very strong, and the third and fourth harmonics but weak.    The vowel _A_ (_ah_) contains besides the fundamental note, the second  harmonic, weak; the third, strong; and the fourth, weak.    The vowel _E_ (_a_) has relatively a feeble fundamental note, the octave  above, the second harmonic, is weak, and the third weak; whereas the fourth  is very strong, and the fifth weak.    The vowel _I_ (_ee_) has very high harmonics, especially the fifth, which  is strongly marked.    We see from these facts that there is a correspondence between the  existence of the higher harmonics and the diminished length of the  resonator. They are not the same in all individuals; for they depend also  upon the _timbre_ of the voice of the person pronouncing them, or the  special character of the language used, as well as upon the pitch of the  fundamental notes employed.    Helmholtz inferred that if the particular quality of the vowel sounds is  due to the reinforcement of the fundamental tone by particular overtones,  he ought to be able to produce synthetically these vowel sounds by  combining the series of overtones with the fundamental note. This he  actually accomplished by the use of stopped organ pipes which gave sensibly  simple notes.           *       *       *       *       *    Having thus shown that the fundamental note is dependent upon the tension  of the vocal cords--the reed portion of the instrument--and the quality,  timbre, or \"klang\" upon the resonator, I will pass on to the formation of  syllables and words of articulate speech by the combination of vowel sounds  and consonants.    \"The articulate sounds called consonants are sounds produced by the  vibrations of certain easily movable portions of the mouth and throat; and  they have a different sound according as they are accompanied by voice or  not\" (Hermann).    The emission of sounds from the resonator may be modified by interruption  or constriction in three situations, at each of which added vibrations may  occur, (1) At the lips, the constriction being formed by the two lips, or  by the upper or lower lip with the lower or upper dental arch. (2) Between  the tongue and the palate, the constriction being caused by the opposition  of the tip of the tongue to the anterior portion of the hard palate or the  posterior surface of the dental arch. (3) At the fauces, the constriction  being due to approximation of the root of the tongue and the soft palate.  Consonants can only be produced in conjunction with a vowel sound,  consequently the air is thrown into sonorous waves of a complex character,  in part dependent upon the shape of the resonator for the production of the  vowel, in part dependent upon the vibrations at each of these situations  mentioned above. Consonants may accordingly be classified as they are  formed at the three places of interruption--lips, teeth, and fauces  respectively: (1) labial; (2) dental; (3) guttural.    The sounds formed at each of the places of interruption are divided into--  1. _Explosives_.--At one of the situations mentioned the resonator is  suddenly opened or closed during the expulsion of air--(_a_) without the  aid of voice, p, t, k; (_b_) with the aid of voice, b, d, g. When one of  these consonants begins a syllable, opening of the resonator is necessary,  e.g. pa; when it ends a syllable, closure is necessary, e.g. ap.

This world is a delightful place to dwell in,    And many sweet and lovely things are in it;    Yet there are sundry, at the which I have    A natural dislike, against all reason.    I never like A TAILOR. Yet no man    Likes a new coat or inexpressibles    Better than I do--few, I think, so well:    I can't account for this. The tailor is,    A far more useful member of society    Than is a poet;--then his sprightly wit,    His glee, his humour, and his happy mind    Entitle him to fair esteem. Allowed.    But then, his self-sufficiency;--his shape    So like a frame, whereon to hang a suit    Of dandy clothes;--his small straight back and arms,    His thick bluff ankles, and his supple knees,    Plague on't!--'Tis wrong--I do not like a tailor.        AN OLD BLUE-STOCKING MAID! Oh! that's a being,    That's hardly to be borne. Her saffron hue,    Her thinnish lips, close primmed as they were sewn    Up by a milliner, and made water-proof,    To guard the fount of wisdom that's within.    Her borrowed locks, of dry and withered hue,    Her straggling beard of ill-condition'd hairs,    And then her jaws of wise and formal cast;    Chat-chat--chat-chat! Grand shrewd remarks!    That may have meaning, may have none for me.    I like the creature so supremely ill,    I never listen, never calculate.    I know this is ungenerous and unjust:    I cannot help it; for I do dislike    An old blue-stocking maid even to extremity.    I do protest I'd rather kiss a tailor.        A GREEDY EATER! He is worst of all.    The gourmand bolts and bolts, and smacks his chops--    Eyes every dish that enters, with a stare    Of greed and terror, lest one thing go by him.    The glances that he casts along the board,    At every slice that's carved, have that in them    Beyond description. I would rather dine    Beside an ox--yea, share his cog of draff;    Or with a dog, if he'd keep his own side;    Than with a glutton on the rarest food.      A thousand times I've dined upon the waste,    On dry-pease bannock, by the silver spring.    O, it was sweet--was healthful--had a zest;    Which at the paste my palate ne'er enjoyed.    My bonnet laid aside, I turned mine eyes    With reverence and humility to heaven,    Craving a blessing from the bounteous Giver;    Then grateful thanks returned. There was a joy    In these lone meals, shared by my faithful dog,    Which I remind with pleasure, and has given    A verdure to my spirit's age. Then think    Of such a man, beside a guzzler set;    And how his stomach nauseates the repast.      \"When he thinks of days he shall never more see.    Of his cake and his cheese, and his lair on the lea,    His laverock that hung on the heaven's ee-bree,      His prayer and his clear mountain rill.\"    I cannot eat one morsel. There is that,    Somewhere within, that balks each bold attempt;    A loathing--a disgust--a something worse:    I know not what it is. A strong desire    To drink, but not for thirst. 'Tis from a wish    To wash down that enormous eater's food--    A sympathetic feeling. Not of love!    And be there ale, or wine, or potent draught    Superior to them both, to that I fly,    And glory in the certainty that mine    Is the ethereal soul of food, while his    Is but the rank corporeal--the vile husks    Best suited to his crude voracity.    And far as the bright spirit may transcend    Its mortal frame, my food transcendeth his.        A CREDITOR! Good heaven, is there beneath    Thy glorious concave of cerulean blue,    A being formed so thoroughly for dislike,    As is a creditor? No, he's supreme,    The devil's a joke to him! Whoe'er has seen    An adder's head upraised, with gleaming eyes,    About to make a spring, may form a shade    Of mild resemblance to a creditor.      I do remember once--'tis long agone--    Of stripping to the waist to wade the Tyne--    The English Tyne, dark, sluggish, broad, and deep;    And just when middle-way, there caught mine eye,    A lamprey of enormous size pursuing me!    L---- what a fright! I bobb'd, I splashed, I flew.    He had a creditor's keen, ominous look,    I never saw an uglier--but a real one.      This is implanted in man's very nature,    It cannot be denied. And once I deemed it    The most degrading stain our nature bore:    Wearing a shade of every hateful vice,    Ingratitude, injustice, selfishness.    But I was wrong, for I have traced the stream    Back to its fountain in the inmost cave,    And found in postulate of purest grain,    It's first beginning.--It is not the man,    The friend who has obliged us, we would shun,    But the conviction which his presence brings,    That we have done him wrong:--a sense of grief    And shame at our own rash improvidence:    The heart bleeds for it, and we love the man    Whom we would shun. The feeling's hard to bear.        A BLUSTERING FELLOW! There's a deadly bore,    Placed in a good man's way, who only yearns    For happiness and joy. But day by day,    This blusterer meets me, and the hope's defaced.    I cannot say a word--make one remark,    That meets not flat and absolute contradiction--    I nothing know on earth--am misinformed    On every circumstance. The very terms,    Scope, rate, and merits of my own transactions    Are all to me unknown, or falsified,    Of which most potent proof can be adduced.    Then the important thump upon the board,    Snap with the thumb, and the disdainful 'whew!'    Sets me and all I say at less than naught.      What can a person do?--To knock him down    Suggests itself, but then it breeds a row    In a friend's house, or haply in your own,    Which is much worse; for glasses go like cinders;    The wine is spilled--the toddy. The chair-backs    Go crash! No, no, there's nothing but forbearance,    And mark'd contempt. If that won't bring him down,    There's nothing will. Ah! can the leopard change    His spots, or the grim Ethiop his hue?    Sooner they may and nature change her course,    Than can a blusterer to a modest man:    He still will stand a beacon of dislike.    A fool--I wish all blustering chaps were dead,    That's the true bathos to have done with them.    _Fraser's Magazine._             *       *       *       *       *        THE GATHERER.

Gad's Hill, not far from Chatham, was formerly a noted place for  depredations on seamen, after they had received their pay at the latter  place. The following robbery was committed there in or verging on the  year 1676: About four o'clock one morning, a gentleman was robbed by one  Nicks, on a bay mare, just as he was on the declivity of the hill, on  the west side. Nicks rode away, and as he said, was stopped nearly an  hour by the difficulty of getting a boat, to enable him to cross the  river; but he made the best use of it as a kind of bait to his horse.  From thence he rode across the county of Essex to Chelmsford. Here he  stopped about an hour to refresh his horse, and give the animal a  ball;--from thence to Braintree, Bocking, and Withersfield; thence over  the Downs to Cambridge; and from thence, keeping still the cross roads,  he went by Fenny Stratford, [9] to Godmanchester and Huntingdon, where  he and his mare baited about an hour; and, as he said himself, he slept  about half an hour: then holding on the north road, and keeping a full  gallop most of the way, he came to York the same afternoon; put off his  boots and riding clothes, and went dressed as if he had been an  inhabitant of the place, to the bowling-green, where, among many other  gentlemen, was the Lord Mayor of the city. He, singling out his  lordship, studied to do something particular that the mayor might  remember him, and then took occasion to ask him what o'clock it was. The  mayor, pulling out his watch, told him the time, which was a quarter  before, or a quarter after eight at night. Upon a prosecution for this  robbery, the whole merit of the case turned upon this single point:--the  person robbed, swore to the man, to the place, and to the time, in which  the robbery was committed; but Nicks, proving by the Lord Mayor of  York, that he was as far off as _Yorkshire_ at that time, the jury  acquitted him on the bare supposition, that the man could not be at two  places so remote on one and the same day.        [9] Fenny, or Fen Stanton, not Stratford, must be here meant, as      the former is in the direct road from Cambridge to Huntingdon.    I need not remind your numerous readers that the roads in 1676 were in a  very different plight to those of 1831; at the former period it would  not have been possible for Tom Thumb to have trotted sixteen miles an  hour on any turnpike road in England. Even my friend, the respected  driver of the Old Union Cambridge Coach to London, can remember, in his  time, the coach being two days on the road, and occasionally being  indebted to farmers for the loan of horses to drag the coach wheels out  of their sloughy tracks.
