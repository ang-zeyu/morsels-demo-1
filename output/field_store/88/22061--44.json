I will rather give thee the sword from the howe, young maid;  I cannot refuse thee.\"    H. \"Thou dost well, son of vikings, to give me the sword from the  howe. I think its possession better than to win all Norway.\"    Her father warns her of the curse, and the doom that the sword  will bring, and she leaves the howes followed by his vain wish:  \"Would that I could give thee the lives of us twelve, the strength  and energy that we sons of Arngrim left behind us!\"    It is unnecessary here to continue the story as the saga does, working  out the doom over later generations; over Hervoer's son Heidrek, who  forfeited his head to Odin in a riddle-contest, and over his children,  another Angantyr, Hlod, and a second Hervoer. The verse sources for  this latter part are very corrupt.    A full discussion of the relation between the Eddic and the Continental  versions of the heroic tales summarised in the foregoing pages would,  of course, be far beyond the scope of this study; the utmost that  can be done in that direction is to suggest a few points. Three of  the stories are not concerned in this section: Helgi and Frodi are  purely Scandinavian cycles; while though Angantyr is a well-known  heroic name (in _Widsith_ Ongendtheow is king of the Swedes), the  legend attached to his name in the Norse sources does not survive  elsewhere. The Weland cycle is perhaps common property. None of the  versions localise it, for the names in _Voelundarkvida_, Wolfdale,  Myrkwood, &c., are conventional heroic place-names. It was popular at a  very early date in England, and is probably a Pan-Germanic legend. The  Sigurd and Hild stories, on the contrary, are both, in all versions,  localised on the Continent, the former by the Rhine, the latter in  Friesland or Jutland; both, therefore, in Low German country, whence  they must have spread to the other Germanic lands. To England they were  doubtless carried by the Low German invaders of the sixth century. On  the question of their passage to the North there are wide differences  of opinion. Most scholars agree that there was an earlier and a later  passage, the first taking Hild, Ermanric, and the Volsung story; the  second, about the twelfth or thirteenth century, the Volsungs again,  with perhaps Dietrich and Attila. But there is much disagreement as to  the date of the first transmission. Muellenhoff put it as early as 600;  Konrad Maurer, in the ninth and tenth centuries; while Dr. Golther  is of opinion that the Volsung story passed first to the vikings in  France, and then westward over Ireland to Iceland; therefore also not  before the ninth century. Such evidence as is afforded by the very  slight English references makes it probable that the Scandinavians  had the tales later than the English, a view supported by the more  highly developed form of the Norse version, and, in the case of the  Volsung cycle, its greater likeness to the Continental German. The  earliest Norse references which can be approximately dated are in the  Skald Bragi (first half of the ninth century), who knew all three  stories: the Hild and Ermanric tales he gives in outline; his only  reference to the Volsungs is a kenning, \"the Volsungs' drink,\" for  serpent. With the possible exception of the Anglo-Saxon fragments,  the Edda preserves on the whole the purest versions of those stories  which are common to all, though, as might be expected, the Continental  sources sometimes show greater originality in isolated details. These  German sources have entangled the different cycles into one involved  mass; but in the Norse the extraneous elements are easily detached.    The motives of heroic tales are limited in number and more or less  common to different races. Heroic cycles differ as a rule merely in  their choice or combination of incidents, not in the nature of their  material. The origin of these heroic motives may generally be found in  primitive custom or conditions of life, seized by an imaginative people  and woven into legend; sometimes linked to the name of some dead tribal  hero, just as the poets of a later date wound the same traditions  in still-varying combinations round the names of Gretti Asmundarson  and Gold-Thori; though often the hero is, like the Gods, born of the  myth. In the latter case, the story is pure myth; in the former it  is legend, or a mixture of history and legend, as in the Ermanric  and Dietrich tales, which have less interest for the mythologist.    The curse-bringing treasure, one of the most fruitful Germanic  motives, probably has its origin in the custom of burying a dead man's  possessions with him. In the _Waterdale Saga_, Ketil Raum, a viking  of the eighth and early ninth centuries, reproaches his son Thorstein  as a degenerate, in that he expects to inherit his father's wealth,  instead of winning fortune for himself: \"It used to be the custom  with kings and earls, men of our kind, that they won for themselves  fortune and fame; wealth was not counted as a heritage, nor would sons  inherit from their fathers, but rather lay their possessions in the  howe with them.\" It is easy to see that when this custom came into  conflict with the son's natural desire to inherit, the sacrosanctity  of the dead man's treasure and of his burial-mound would be their only  protection against violation. The fear of the consequences of breaking  the custom took form in the myth of the curse, as in the sword of  Angantyr and the Nibelungs' hoard; while the dangers attending the  violation of the howe were personified in the dragon-guardian. In  _Gold-Thori's Saga_, the dead berserks whose howe Thori enters, are  found guarding their treasure in the shape of dragons; while Thori  himself is said to have turned into a dragon after death.    Marriage with alien wives, which in the case of the Mastermaid story  has been postulated as means of transmission and as the one possible  explanation of its nearly universal diffusion, may perhaps with more  simplicity be assumed as the common basis in custom for independently  arising myths of this type. The attempts of the bride's kindred to  prevent the marriage, and of the bridegroom's to undo it, would be  natural incidents in such a story, and the magic powers employed by  and against the bride would be the mythical representatives of the  mutually unfamiliar customs of alien tribes. This theory at least  offers a credible explanation of the hero's temporary oblivion of  or unfaithfulness to his protectress, after their successful escape  together.    In the Valkyrie-brides, Brynhild and Sigrun, with their double  attributes of fighting and wisdom, there is an evident connexion  with the Germanic type of woman preserved in the allusions of Caesar  and Tacitus, which reaches its highest development in the heroines  of the Edda. Any mythical or ideal conception of womanhood combines  the two primitive instincts, love and fighting, even though the woman  may be only the innocent cause of strife, or its passive prize. The  peculiarity of the Germanic representation is that the woman is never  passive, but is herself the incarnation of both instincts. Even  if she is not a Valkyrie, nor taking part herself in the fight,  she is ready, like the wives of the Cimbri, to drive the men back  to the battle from which they have escaped. Hild and Hervoer are at  one extreme: war is their spiritual life. Love is in Hild nothing  more than instinct; in Hervoer it is not even that: she would desire  nothing from marriage beyond a son to inherit the sword. At the other  extreme is Sigrun, who has the warlike instinct, but is spiritually a  lover as completely and essentially as Isolde or Juliet. The interest  in Signy lies in the way in which she sacrifices what are usually  considered the strongest feminine instincts, without, however, by  any means abandoning them, to her uncompromising revenge and pride  of race. Her pride in her son seems to include something of both  trains of feeling; and she dies with the husband she detests, simply  because he is her husband. Brynhild, lastly, is a highly modern type,  as independent in love as in war. It is impossible to imagine Sigrun,  or Wagner's Sieglinde, taking her revenge on a faithless lover;  from no lack of spirit, but simply because revenge would have given  no comfort to either. To Brynhild it is not only a distinct relief,  but the only endurable end; she can forgive when she is avenged.    The other motives of these stories may be briefly enumerated. The  burning of Brynhild and Signy, and Sigrun's entrance into the howe,  are mythical reminiscences of widow-burial. The \"sister's son\" is  preserved in the Sigmund and Sinfjoetli tale, which also has a trace  of animism in the werwolf episode. The common swanmaid motive occurs  in two, the Voelund story and the legend of Helgi and Kara; while the  first Helgi tale suggests the Levirate in the proposed marriage of  Svava to her husband's brother. The waverlowe of the Volsung myth  may be traced back to the midsummer fires; the wooing of Brynhild  by Sigurd's crossing the fire would thus, like the similar bridal  of Menglad and Svipdag and the winning of Gerd for Frey, be based on  the marriages which formed a part of agricultural rites.            Bibliographical Notes      To avoid confusion, and in view of the customary loose usage of the  word \"saga,\" it may be as well to state that it is here used only in  its technical sense of a prose history."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#7)"],[1," now lit by the rays of a vertical sun, now darkened under  the flying shadows thrown by the fleecy clouds which sail across the  sky. Under such a heaven, what painter could limn the lights and  shades which flit over the woods, the pride of Japan, whether in late  autumn, when the russets and yellows of our own trees are mixed with  the deep crimson glow of the maples, or in spring-time, when plum and  cherry trees and wild camellias--giants, fifty feet high--are in full  blossom?    All that we see is enchanting, but there is a strange stillness in the  groves; rarely does the song of a bird break the silence; indeed, I  know but one warbler whose note has any music in it, the _uguisu_, by  some enthusiasts called the Japanese nightingale--at best, a king in  the kingdom of the blind. The scarcity of animal life of all  descriptions, man and mosquitoes alone excepted, is a standing wonder  to the traveller; the sportsman must toil many a weary mile to get a  shot at boar, or deer, or pheasant; and the plough of the farmer and  the trap of the poacher, who works in and out of season, threaten to  exterminate all wild creatures; unless, indeed, the Government should,  as they threatened in the spring of 1869, put in force some adaptation  of European game-laws. But they are lukewarm in the matter; a little  hawking on a duck-pond satisfies the cravings of the modern Japanese  sportsman, who knows that, game-laws or no game-laws, the wild fowl  will never fail in winter; and the days are long past when my Lord the  Shogun used to ride forth with a mighty company to the wild places  about Mount Fuji, there camping out and hunting the boar, the deer,  and the wolf, believing that in so doing he was fostering a manly and  military spirit in the land.    There is one serious drawback to the enjoyment of the beauties of the  Japanese country, and that is the intolerable affront which is  continually offered to one's sense of smell; the whole of what should  form the sewerage of the city is carried out on the backs of men and  horses, to be thrown upon the fields; and, if you would avoid the  overpowering nuisance, you must walk handkerchief in hand, ready to  shut out the stench which assails you at every moment.    It would seem natural, while writing of the Japanese country, to say a  few words about the peasantry, their relation to the lord of the soil,  and their government. But these I must reserve for another place. At  present our dealings are with the pretty village of Meguro.    At the bottom of a little lane, close to the entrance of the village,  stands an old shrine of the Shinto (the form of hero-worship which  existed in Japan before the introduction of Confucianism or of  Buddhism), surrounded by lofty Cryptomerias. The trees around a Shinto  shrine are specially under the protection of the god to whom the altar  is dedicated; and, in connection with them, there is a kind of magic  still respected by the superstitious, which recalls the waxen dolls,  through the medium of which sorcerers of the middle ages in Europe,  and indeed those of ancient Greece, as Theocritus tells us, pretended  to kill the enemies of their clients. This is called _Ushi no toki  mairi,_ or \"going to worship at the hour of the ox,\"[9] and is  practised by jealous women who wish to be revenged upon their  faithless lovers.    [Footnote 9: The Chinese, and the Japanese following them, divide the  day of twenty-four hours into twelve periods, each of which has a sign  something like the signs of the Zodiac:--    Midnight until two in the morning is represented by the rat.      2 a.m.  \"     4 a.m.          \"            \"          ox.      4 a.m.  \"     6 a.m.          \"            \"          tiger.      6 a.m.  \"     8 a.m.          \"            \"          hare.      8 a.m.  \"    10 a.m.          \"            \"          dragon.     10 a.m.  \"    12 noon          \"            \"          snake.     12 noon  \"     2 p.m.          \"            \"          horse.      2 p.m.  \"     4 p.m.          \"            \"          ram.      4 p.m.  \"     6 p.m.          \"            \"          ape.      6 p.m.  \"     8 p.m.          \"            \"          cock.      8 p.m.  \"    10 p.m.          \"            \"          hog.     10 p.m.  \"    Midnight         \"            \"          fox.]    When the world is at rest, at two in the morning, the hour of which  the ox is the symbol, the woman rises; she dons a white robe and high  sandals or clogs; her coif is a metal tripod, in which are thrust  three lighted candles; around her neck she hangs a mirror, which falls  upon her bosom; in her left hand she carries a small straw figure, the  effigy of the lover who has abandoned her, and in her right she grasps  a hammer and nails, with which she fastens the figure to one of the  sacred trees that surround the shrine. There she prays for the death  of the traitor, vowing that, if her petition be heard, she will  herself pull out the nails which now offend the god by wounding the  mystic tree. Night after night she comes to the shrine, and each night  she strikes in two or more nails, believing that every nail will  shorten her lover's life, for the god, to save his tree, will surely  strike him dead.    Meguro is one of the many places round Yedo to which the good citizens  flock for purposes convivial or religious, or both; hence it is that,  cheek by jowl with the old shrines and temples, you will find many a  pretty tea-house, standing at the rival doors of which Mesdemoiselles  Sugar, Wave of the Sea, Flower, Seashore, and Chrysanthemum are  pressing in their invitations to you to enter and rest. Not beautiful  these damsels, if judged by our standard, but the charm of Japanese  women lies in their manner and dainty little ways, and the tea-house  girl, being a professional decoy-duck, is an adept in the art of  flirting,--_en tout bien tout honneur_, be it remembered; for she is  not to be confounded with the frail beauties of the Yoshiwara, nor  even with her sisterhood near the ports open to foreigners, and to  their corrupting influence. For, strange as it seems, our contact all  over the East has an evil effect upon the natives.    In one of the tea-houses a thriving trade is carried on in the sale of  wooden tablets, some six inches square, adorned with the picture of a  pink cuttlefish on a bright blue ground. These are ex-votos, destined  to be offered up at the Temple of Yakushi Niurai, the Buddhist  AEsculapius, which stands opposite, and concerning the foundation of  which the following legend is told.    In the days of old there was a priest called Jikaku, who at the age of  forty years, it being the autumn of the tenth year of the period  called Tencho (A.D. 833), was suffering from disease of the eyes,  which had attacked him three years before. In order to be healed from  this disease he carved a figure of Yakushi Niurai, to which he used  to offer up his prayers. Five years later he went to China, taking  with him the figure as his guardian saint, and at a place called  Kairetsu it protected him from robbers and wild beasts and from other  calamities. There he passed his time in studying the sacred laws both  hidden and revealed, and after nine years set sail to return to Japan.  When he was on the high seas a storm arose, and a great fish attacked  and tried to swamp the ship, so that the rudder and mast were broken,  and the nearest shore being that of a land inhabited by devils, to  retreat or to advance was equally dangerous. Then the holy man prayed  to the patron saint whose image he carried, and as he prayed, behold  the true Yakushi Niurai appeared in the centre of the ship, and said  to him--    \"Verily, thou hast travelled far that the sacred laws might be  revealed for the salvation of many men; now, therefore, take my image,  which thou carriest in thy bosom, and cast it into the sea, that the  wind may abate, and that thou mayest be delivered from this land of  devils.\"    The commands of the saints must be obeyed, so with tears in his eyes,  the priest threw into the sea the sacred image which he loved. Then  did the wind abate, and the waves were stilled, and the ship went on  her course as though she were being drawn by unseen hands until she  reached a safe haven. In the tenth month of the same year the priest  again set sail, trusting to the power of his patron saint, and reached  the harbour of Tsukushi without mishap. For three years he prayed that  the image which he had cast away might be restored to him, until at  last one night he was warned in a dream that on the sea-shore at  Matsura Yakushi Niurai would appear to him. In consequence of this  dream he went to the province of Hizen, and landed on the sea-shore at  Hirato, where, in the midst of a blaze of light, the image which he  had carved appeared to him twice, riding on the back of a cuttlefish.  Thus was the image restored to the world by a miracle. In  commemoration of his recovery from the disease of the eyes and of his  preservation from the dangers of the sea, that these things might be  known to all posterity, the priest established the worship of Tako  Yakushi Niurai (\"Yakushi Niurai of the Cuttlefish\") and came to  Meguro, where he built the Temple of Fudo Sama,[10] another Buddhist  divinity. At this time there was an epidemic of small-pox in the  village, so that men fell down and died in the street, and the holy  man prayed to Fudo Sama that the plague might be stayed. Then the god  appeared to him, and said--    \"The saint Yakushi Niurai of the Cuttlefish, whose image thou  carriest, desires to have his place in this village, and he will heal  this plague. Thou shalt, therefore, raise a temple to him here that  not only this small-pox, but other diseases for future generations,  may be cured by his power.\"    [Footnote 10: Fudo, literally \"the motionless\": Buddha in the state  called Nirvana.]    Hearing this, the priest shed tears of"]]]
