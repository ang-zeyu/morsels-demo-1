However, venturing on the deed which brought him to his death,  the person injured soon seized him, and being inexorable in his  prosecution, Trippuck was cast and received sentence. However, having  still some money, he did not lose all hope of a reprieve, but kept up  his spirits by flattering himself with his life being preserved, till  within a very few days of the execution. If the Ordinary spoke to him of  the affairs of the soul, Trippuck immediately cut him short with, _D'ye  believe I can obtain a pardon? I don't know that, indeed_, says the  doctor. _But you know one Counsellor Such-a-one_, says Trippuck,  _prithee make use of your interest with him, and see whether you can get  him to serve me. I'll not be ungrateful, doctor._    The Ordinary was almost at his wits' end with this sort of cross  purposes; however, he went on to exhort him to think of the great work  he had to do, and entreated him to consider the nature of that  repentance which must atone for all his numerous offences. Upon this,  Trippuck opened his breast and showed him a great number of scars  amongst which were two very large ones, out of which he said two musket  bullets had been extracted. _And will not these, good doctor_, quoth he,  _and the vast pains I have endured in their cure, in some sort lessen  the heinousness of the facts I may have committed? No_, said the  Ordinary, _what evils have fallen upon you in such expeditions, you have  drawn upon yourself, and do not imagine that these will in any degree  make amends for the multitude of your offences. You had much better  clear your conscience by a full and ingenious confession of your crimes,  and prepare in earnest for another world, since I dare assure you, you  need entertain no hopes of staying in this._    As soon as be found the Ordinary was in the right, and that all  expectation of a reprieve or pardon were totally in vain, Trippuck  began, as most of those sort of people do, to lose much of that  stubbornness they mistake for courage. He now felt all the terrors of an  awakened conscience, and persisted no longer in denying the crime for  which he died, though at first he declared it altogether a falsehood,  and Constable, his companion, had denied it even to death. As is  customary when persons are under their misfortune, it had been reported  that this Trippuck was the man who killed Mr. Hall towards the end of  the summer before on Blackheath, but when the story reached the Golden  Tinman's ears he declared it was an utter falsity; repeating this  assertion to the Ordinary a few moments before his being turned off, and  pointing to the rope about him, he said, _As you see this instrument of  death about me, what I say is the real truth._ He died with all outward  signs of penitence.    Richard Cane was a young man of about twenty-two years of age, at the  time he suffered. Having a tolerable genius when a youth, his friends  put him apprentice twice, but to no purpose, for having got rambling  notions in his head, he would needs go to sea. There, but for his  unhappy temper, he might have done well, for the ship of war in which he  sailed was so fortunate as to take, after eight hours sharp engagement,  a Spanish vessel of immense value; but the share he got did him little  service. As soon as he came home Richard made a quick hand of it, and  when the usual train of sensual delights which pass for pleasures in low  life had exhausted him to the last farthing, necessity and the desire of  still indulging his vices, made him fall into the worst and most  unlawful methods to obtain the means which they might procure them.    Sometime after this, the unhappy man of whom we are speaking fell in  love (as the vulgar call it) with an honest, virtuous, young woman, who  lived with her mother, a poor, well-meaning creature, utterly ignorant  of Cane's behaviour, or that he had ever committed any crimes punishable  by Law. The girl, as such silly people are wont, yielded quickly to a  marriage which was to be consummated privately, because Cane's relations  were not to be disobliged, who it seems did not think him totally ruined  so long as he escaped matrimony. But the unhappy youth not having enough  money to procure a licence, and being ashamed to put the expense on the  woman and her mother, in a fit of amorous distraction went out from  them one evening, and meeting a man somewhat fuddled in the street,  threw him down, and took away his hat and coat. The fellow was not so  drunk but that he cried out, and people coming to his assistance, Cane  was immediately apprehended, and so this fact, instead of raising him  money enough to be married, brought him to death in this ignominious  way.    While he lay in Newgate, the miserable young creature who was to have  been his wife came constantly to cry with him and deplore their mutual  misfortunes, which were increased by the girl's mother falling sick, and  being confined to her bed through grief for her designed son-in-law's  fate. When the day of his suffering drew on, this unhappy man composed  himself to submit to it with great serenity. He professed abundance of  contrition for the wickedness of his former life and lamented with much  tenderness those evils he had brought upon the girl and her mother. The  softness of his temper, and the steady affection he had for the maid,  contributed to make his exit much pitied; which happened at Tyburn in  the twenty-second year of his age. He left this paper behind him, which  he spoke at the tree.        Good People,        The Law having justly condemned me for my offence to suffer in this      shameful manner, I thought it might be expected that I should say      something here of the crime for which I die, the commission of which      I do readily acknowledge, though it was attended with that      circumstance of knocking down, which was sworn against me. I own I      have been guilty of much wickedness, and am exceedingly troubled at      the reflection it may bring upon my relations, who are all honest      and reputable people. As I die for the offences I have done, and die      in charity forgiving all the world, so I hope none will be so cruel      as to pursue my memory with disgrace or insult an unhappy young      woman on my account, whose character I must vindicate with my last      breath, as all the justice I am able to do her, I die in the      communion of the Church of England and humbly request your prayers      for my departing soul.    Richard Shepherd was born of very honest and reputable parents in the  city of Oxford, who were careful in giving him a suitable education,  which he, through the wickedness of his future life, utterly forgot,  insomuch that he knew scarce the Creed and the Lord's Prayer, at the  time he had most need of them. When he grew a tolerable big lad his  friends put him out as apprentice to a butcher, where having served a  great part of his time, he fell in love, as they call it, with a young  country lass hard by, and Dick's passion growing outrageous, he attacked  the poor maid with all the amorous strains of gallantry he was able. The  hearts of young uneducated wenches, like unfortified towns, make little  resistance when once beseiged, and therefore Shepherd had no great  difficulty in making a conquest. However the girl insisted on honourable  terms, and unfortunately for the poor fellow they were married before  his time was out; an error in conduct, which in low life is seldom  retrieved.    It happened so here. Shepherd's master was not long before he discovered  this wedding. He thereupon gave the poor fellow so much trouble that he  was at last forced to give him forty shillings down, and a bond for  twenty-eight pounds more. This having totally ruined him, Dick unhappily  fell into the way of dishonest company, who soon drew him into their  ways of gaining money and supplying his necessities at the hazard both  of his conscience and his neck; in which, though he became an expert  proficient, yet could he never acquire anything considerable thereby,  but was continually embroiled in debt. His wife bringing every year a  child, contributed not a little thereto. However, Dick rubbed on mostly  by thieving and as little by working as it was possible to avoid.    When he first began his robberies, he went housebreaking, and actually  committed several facts in the city of Oxford itself. But those things  not being so easily to be concealed there as at London, report quickly  began to grow very loud about him, and Dick was forced to make shift  with pilfering in other places; in which he was (to use the manner of  speaking of those people) so unlucky that the second or third fact he  committed in Hertfordshire, he was detected, seized, and at the next  assizes capitally convicted. Yet out of compassion to his youth, and in  hopes he might be sufficiently checked by so narrow an escape from the  gallows, his friends procured him first a reprieve and then a pardon.    But this proximity to death made little impression on his heart, which  is too often the fault in persons who, like him, receive mercy, and have  notwithstanding too little grace to make use of it. Partly driven by  necessity, for few people cared after his release to employ him, partly  through the instigations of his own wicked heart, Dick went again upon  the old trade for which he had so lately been like to have suffered,  but thieving was still an unfortunate profession to him. He soon after  fell again into the hands of Justice, from whence he escaped by  impeaching Allen and Chambers, two of his accomplices, and so evaded  Tyburn a second time. Yet all this signified nothing to him, for as soon  as he was at home, so soon to work he went in his old way, till  apprehended and executed for his wickedness.    No unhappy criminal had more warning than Shepherd of his approaching  miserable fate, if he would have suffered anything to have deterred "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13102"],[0,"The Decameron, Volume II (#7)"],[1,"tro, let us flee;\" and guiding her  nag as best she knew towards a great forest, she planted the spurs in his  sides, and so, holding on by the saddle-bow, was borne by the goaded  creature into the forest at a gallop. Pietro, who had been too engrossed  with her face to give due heed to the way, and thus had not been ware, as  soon as she, of the approach of the men at arms, was still looking about  to see whence they were coming, when they came up with him, and took him  prisoner, and forced him to dismount. Then they asked who he was, and,  when he told them, they conferred among themselves, saying:--\"This is one  of the friends of our enemies: what else can we do but relieve him of his  nag and of his clothes, and hang him on one of these oaks in scorn of the  Orsini?\" To which proposal all agreeing, they bade Pietro strip himself:  but while, already divining his fate, he was so doing, an ambuscade of  full five-and-twenty men at arms fell suddenly upon them,  crying:--\"Death, death!\" Thus surprised, they let Pietro go, and stood on  the defensive; but, seeing that the enemy greatly outnumbered them, they  took to their heels, the others giving chase. Whereupon Pietro hastily  resumed his clothes, mounted his nag, and fled with all speed in the  direction which he had seen the damsel take. But finding no road or path  through the forest, nor discerning any trace of a horse's hooves, he  was--for that he found not the damsel--albeit he deemed himself safe out  of the clutches of his captors and their assailants, the most wretched  man alive, and fell a weeping and wandering hither and thither about the  forest, uttering Agnolella's name. None answered; but turn back he dared  not: so on he went, not knowing whither he went; besides which, he was in  mortal dread of the wild beasts that infest the forest, as well on  account of himself as of the damsel, whom momently he seemed to see  throttled by some bear or wolf. Thus did our unfortunate Pietro spend the  whole day, wandering about the forest, making it to resound with his  cries of Agnolella's name, and harking at times back, when he thought to  go forward; until at last, what with his cries and his tears and his  fears and his long fasting, he was so spent that he could go no further.  'Twas then nightfall, and, as he knew not what else to do, he dismounted  at the foot of an immense oak, and having tethered his nag to the trunk,  climbed up into the branches, lest he should be devoured by the wild  beasts during the night. Shortly afterwards the moon rose with a very  clear sky, and Pietro, who dared not sleep, lest he should fall, and  indeed, had he been secure from that risk, his misery and his anxiety on  account of the damsel would not have suffered him to sleep, kept watch,  sighing and weeping and cursing his evil luck.    Now the damsel, who, as we said before, had fled she knew not whither,  allowing her nag to carry her whithersoever he would, strayed so far into  the forest that she lost sight of the place where she had entered it, and  spent the whole day just as Pietro had done, wandering about the  wilderness, pausing from time to time, and weeping, and uttering his  name, and bewailing her evil fortune. At last, seeing that 'twas now the  vesper hour and Pietro came not, she struck into a path, which the nag  followed, until, after riding some two miles, she espied at some distance  a cottage, for which she made with all speed, and found there a good man,  well stricken in years, with his wife, who was likewise aged. Seeing her  ride up alone, they said:--\"Daughter, wherefore ridest thou thus alone at  this hour in these parts?\" Weeping, the damsel made answer that she had  lost her companion in the forest, and asked how far might Anagni be from  there? \"My daughter,\" returned the good man, \"this is not the road to  Anagni; 'tis more than twelve miles away.\" \"And how far off,\" inquired  the damsel, \"are the nearest houses in which one might find lodging for  the night?\" \"There are none so near,\" replied the good man, \"that thou  canst reach them to-day.\" \"Then, so please you,\" said the damsel, \"since  go elsewhither I cannot, for God's sake let me pass the night here with  you.\" Whereto the good man made answer:--\"Damsel, welcome art thou to  tarry the night with us; but still thou art to know that these parts are  infested both by day and by night by bands, which, be they friends or be  they foes, are alike ill to meet with, and not seldom do much despite and  mischief, and if by misadventure one of these bands should visit us while  thou wert here, and marking thy youth and beauty should do thee despite  and dishonour, we should be unable to afford thee any succour. This we  would have thee know, that if it should so come to pass, thou mayst not  have cause to reproach us.\" The damsel heard not the old man's words  without dismay; but, seeing that the hour was now late, she  answered:--\"God, if He be so pleased, will save both you and me from such  molestation, and if not, 'tis a much lesser evil to be maltreated by men  than to be torn in pieces by the wild beasts in the forest.\" So saying,  she dismounted, and entered the cottage, where, having supped with the  poor man and his wife on such humble fare as they had, she laid herself  in her clothes beside them in their bed. She slept not, however; for her  own evil plight and that of Pietro, for whom she knew not how to augur  aught but evil, kept her sighing and weeping all night long. And towards  matins she heard a great noise as of men that marched; so up she got and  hied her into a large courtyard that was in rear of the cottage, and part  of which was covered with a great heap of hay, which she espying, hid  herself therein, that, if the men came there, they might not so readily  find her. Scarce had she done so than the men, who proved to be a strong  company of marauders, were at the door of the cottage, which they forced  open; and having entered, and found the damsel's nag, still saddled, they  asked who was there. The damsel being out of sight, the good man  answered:--\"There is none here but my wife and I; but this nag, which has  given some one the slip, found his way hither last night, and we housed  him, lest he should be devoured by the wolves.\" \"So!\" said the chief of  the band, \"as he has no owner, he will come in very handy for us.\"    Whereupon, in several parties, they ransacked the cottage from top to  bottom; and one party went out into the courtyard, where, as they threw  aside their lances and targets, it so befell that one of them, not  knowing where else to bestow his lance, tossed it into the hay, and was  within an ace of killing the damsel that lay hid there, as likewise she  of betraying her whereabouts, for the lance all but grazing her left  breast, insomuch that the head tore her apparel, she doubted she was  wounded, and had given a great shriek, but that, remembering where she  was, she refrained for fear. By and by the company cooked them a  breakfast of kid's and other meat, and having eaten and drunken,  dispersed in divers directions, as their affairs required, taking the  girl's nag with them. And when they were gotten some little way off, the  good man asked his wife:--\"What became of the damsel, our guest of last  night, that I have not seen her since we rose?\" The good woman answered  that she knew not where the damsel was, and went to look for her. The  damsel, discovering that the men were gone, came forth of the hay, and  the good man, seeing her, was overjoyed that she had not fallen into the  hands of the ruffians, and, as day was breaking, said to her:--\"Now that  day is at hand, we will, so it like thee, escort thee to a castle, some  five miles hence, where thou wilt be in safety; but thou must needs go  afoot, because these villains, that are but just gone, have taken thy nag  with them.\" The damsel, resigning herself to her loss, besought them for  God's sake to take her to the castle: whereupon they set forth, and  arrived there about half tierce. Now the castle belonged to one of the  Orsini, Liello di Campo di Fiore by name, whose wife, as it chanced, was  there. A most kindly and good woman she was, and, recognizing the damsel  as soon as she saw her, gave her a hearty welcome and would fain have  from her a particular account of how she came there. So the damsel told  her the whole story. The lady, to whom Pietro was also known, as being a  friend of her husband, was distressed to hear of his misadventure, and  being told where he was taken, gave him up for dead. So she said to the  damsel:--\"Since so it is that thou knowest not how Pietro has fared, thou  shalt stay here with me until such time as I may have opportunity to send  thee safely back to Rome.\"    Meanwhile Pietro, perched on his oak in as woeful a plight as might be,  had espied, when he should have been in his first sleep, a full score of  wolves, that, as they prowled, caught sight of the nag, and straightway  were upon him on all sides. The horse, as soon as he was ware of their  approach, strained on the reins till they snapped, and tried to make good  his escape; but, being hemmed in, was brought to bay, and made a long  fight of it with his teeth and hooves; but in the end they bore him down  and throttled him and forthwith eviscerated him, and, the whole pack  falling upon him, devoured him to the bone before they had done with him.  Whereat Pietro, who felt that in the nag he had lost a companion and a  comfort in his travail, was sorely dismayed, and began to think that he  should never get out of the forest. But towards dawn, he, perched there  in the oak, almost dead with cold, looking around him as he frequently  did, espied about a mile off a huge fire. Wherefore, as soon as 'twas  broad day, he got down, not without trepidation, from the oak, and bent  his steps towards the fire; and being come to it, he found, gathered  about it, a company of"]]]
