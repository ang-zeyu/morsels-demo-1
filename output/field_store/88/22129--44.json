Is this not so?    But, the Hermetic teaching does not imply a real duality--THE ALL is  ONE--the Two Aspects are merely aspects of manifestation. The teaching  is that The Masculine Principle manifested by THE ALL stands, in a way,  apart from the actual mental creation of the Universe. It projects its  Will toward the Feminine Principle (which may be called \"Nature\")  whereupon the latter begins the actual work of the evolution of the  Universe, from simple \"centers of activity\" on to man, and then on and  on still higher, all according to well-established and firmly enforced  Laws of Nature. If you prefer the old figures of thought, you may think  of the Masculine Principle as GOD, the Father, and of the Feminine  Principle as NATURE, the Universal Mother, from whose womb all things  have been born. This is more than a mere poetic figure of speech--it is  an idea of the actual process of the creation of the Universe. But  always remember, that THE ALL is but One, and that in its Infinite Mind  the Universe is generated, created and exists.    It may help you to get the proper idea, if you will apply the Law of  Correspondence to yourself, and your own mind. You know that the part of  You which you call \"I,\" in a sense, stands apart and witnesses the  creation of mental Images in your own mind. The part of your mind in  which the mental generation is accomplished may be called the \"Me\" in  distinction from the \"I\" which stands apart and witnesses and examines  the thoughts, ideas and images of the \"Me.\"  \"As above, so below,\"  remember, and the phenomena of one plane may be employed to solve the  riddles of higher or lower planes.    Is it any wonder that You, the child, feel that instinctive reverence  for THE ALL, which feeling we call \"religion\"--that respect, and  reverence for THE FATHER MIND? Is it any wonder that, when you consider  the works and wonders of Nature, you are overcome with a mighty feeling  which has its roots away down in your inmost being? It is the MOTHER  MIND that you are pressing close up to, like a babe to the breast.    Do not make the mistake of supposing that the little world you see  around you--the Earth, which is a mere grain of dust in the Universe--is  the Universe itself. There are millions upon millions of such worlds,  and greater. And there are millions of millions of such Universes in  existence within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL. And even in our own  little solar system there are regions and planes of life far higher than  ours, and beings compared to which we earth-bound mortals are as the  slimy life-forms that dwell on the ocean's bed when compared to Man.  There are beings with powers and attributes higher than Man has ever  dreamed of the gods' possessing. And yet these beings were once as you,  and still lower--and you will be even as they, and still higher, in  time, for such is the Destiny of Man as reported by the Illumined.    And Death is not real, even in the Relative sense--it is but Birth to a  new life--and You shall go on, and on, and on, to higher and still  higher planes of life, for aeons upon aeons of time. The Universe is  your home, and you shall explore its farthest recesses before the end of  Time. You are dwelling in the Infinite Mind of THE ALL, and your  possibilities and opportunities are infinite, both in time and space.  And at the end of the Grand Cycle of Aeons, when THE ALL shall draw back  into itself all of its creations--you will go gladly for you will then  be able to know the Whole Truth of being At One with THE ALL. Such is  the report of the Illumined--those who have advanced well along The  Path.    And, in the meantime, rest calm and serene--you are safe and protected  by the Infinite Power of the FATHER-MOTHER MIND.        \"Within the Father-Mother Mind, mortal children are at      home.\"--The Kybalion.        \"There is not one who is Fatherless, nor Motherless in the      Universe.\"--The Kybalion.        CHAPTER VI    THE DIVINE PARADOX        \"The half-wise, recognizing the comparative unreality of      the Universe, imagine that they may defy its Laws--such      are vain and presumptuous fools, and they are broken against      the rocks and torn asunder by the elements by reason of      their folly. The truly wise, knowing the nature of the Universe,      use Law against laws; the higher against the lower; and by      the Art of Alchemy transmute that which is undesirable into      that which is worthy, and thus triumph. Mastery consists not      in abnormal dreams, visions and fantastic imaginings or      living, but in using the higher forces against the lower--escaping      the pains of the lower planes by vibrating on the higher.      Transmutation, not presumptuous denial, is the weapon of the      Master.\"--The Kybalion.    This is the Paradox of the Universe, resulting from the Principle of  Polarity which manifests when THE ALL begins to Create--hearken to it  for it points the difference between half-wisdom and wisdom. While to  THE INFINITE ALL, the Universe, its Laws, its Powers, its life, its  Phenomena, are as things witnessed in the state of Meditation or Dream;  yet to all that is Finite, the Universe must be treated as Real, and  life, and action, and thought, must be based thereupon, accordingly,  although with an ever understanding of the Higher Truth. Each according  to its own Plane and Laws. Were THE ALL to imagine that the Universe  were indeed Reality, then woe to the Universe, for there would be then  no escape from lower to higher, divineward--then would the Universe  become a fixity and progress would become impossible. And if Man, owing  to half-wisdom, acts and lives and thinks of the Universe as merely a  dream (akin to his own finite dreams) then indeed does it so become for  him, and like a sleep-walker he stumbles ever around and around in a  circle, making no progress, and being forced into an awakening at last  by his falling bruised and bleeding over the Natural Laws which he  ignored. Keep your mind ever on the Star, but let your eyes watch over  your footsteps, lest you fall into the mire by reason of your upward  gaze. Remember the Divine Paradox, that while the Universe IS NOT, still  IT IS. Remember ever the Two Poles of Truth the Absolute and the  Relative. Beware of Half-Truths.    What Hermetists know as \"the Law of Paradox\" is an aspect of the  Principle of Polarity. The Hermetic writings are filled with references  to the appearance of the Paradox in the consideration of the problems of  Life and Being. The Teachers are constantly warning their students  against the error of omitting the \"other side\" of any question. And  their warnings are particularly directed to the problems of the Absolute  and the Relative, which perplex all students of philosophy, and which  cause so many to think and act contrary to what is generally known as  \"common sense.\" And we caution all students to be sure to grasp the  Divine Paradox of the Absolute and Relative, lest they become entangled  in the mire of the Half-Truth. With this in view this particular lesson  has been written. Read it carefully!    The first thought that comes to the thinking man after he realizes the  truth that the Universe is a Mental Creation of THE ALL, is that the  Universe and all that it contains is a mere illusion; an unreality;  against which idea his instincts revolt. But this, like all other great  truths, must be considered both from the Absolute and the Relative  points of view. From the Absolute viewpoint, of course, the Universe is  in the nature of an illusion, a dream, a phantasmagoria, as compared to  THE ALL in itself. We recognize this even in our ordinary view, for we  speak of the world as \"a fleeting show\" that comes and goes, is born and  dies--for the element of impermanence and change, finiteness and  unsubstantiality, must ever be connected with the idea of a created  Universe when it is contrasted with the idea of THE ALL, no matter what  may be our beliefs concerning the nature of both. Philosopher,  metaphysician, scientist and theologian all agree upon this idea, and  the thought is found in all forms of philosophical thought and religious  conceptions, as well as in the theories of the respective schools of  metaphysics and theology.    So, the Hermetic Teachings do not preach the unsubstantiality of the  Universe in any stronger terms than those more familiar to you, although  their presentation of the subject may seem somewhat more startling.  Anything that has a beginning and an ending must be, in a sense, unreal  and untrue, and the Universe comes under the rule, in all schools of  thought. From the Absolute point of view, there is nothing Real except  THE ALL, no matter what terms we may use in thinking of, or discussing  the subject. Whether the Universe be created of Matter, or whether it be  a Mental Creation in the Mind of THE ALL--it is unsubstantial,  non-enduring, a thing of time, space and change. We want you to realize  this fact thoroughly, before you pass judgment on the Hermetic  conception of the Mental nature of the Universe. Think over any and all  of the other conceptions, and see whether this be not true of them.    But the Absolute point of view shows merely one side of the picture--the  other side is the Relative one. Absolute Truth has been defined as  \"Things as the mind of God knows them,\" while Relative Truth is \"Things  as the highest reason of Man understands them.\" And so while to THE ALL  the Universe must be unreal and illusionary, a mere dream or result of  meditation,--nevertheless, to the finite minds forming a part of that  Universe, and viewing it through mortal faculties, the Universe is very  real indeed, and must be so considered. In recognizing the Absolute  view, we must not make the mistake of ignoring or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14218"],[0,"The Story of Alchemy and the Beginnings of Chemistry (#7)"],[1," since the  violence they are presumed to suffer from outward agents is likewise  exercised no otherwise than according to the established laws of  universal nature.\"    There must be something very fascinating and comforting in the  alchemical view of nature, as a harmony constructed on one simple  plan, which can be grasped as a whole, and also in its details, by the  introspective processes of the human intellect; for that conception  prevails to-day among those who have not investigated natural  occurrences for themselves. The alchemical view of nature still forms  the foundation of systems of ethics, of philosophy, of art. It appeals  to the innate desire of man to make himself the measure of all  things. It is so easy, so authoritative, apparently so satisfactory.  No amount of thinking and reasoning will ever demonstrate its falsity.  It can be conquered only by a patient, unbiassed, searching  examination of some limited portion of natural events.          CHAPTER IV.    THE ALCHEMICAL ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES.      The alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals  was that they should become gold, for gold was considered to be the  most perfect metal, and nature, they said, evidently strains after  perfection. The alchemist found that metals were worn away, eaten  through, broken, and finally caused to disappear, by many acid and  acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances. But gold  resisted the attacks of these liquids; it was not changed by heat, nor  was it affected by sulphur, a substance which changed limpid, running  mercury into an inert, black solid. Hence, gold was more perfect in  the alchemical scale than any other metal.    Since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal, it was  self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly  in the earth, must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold.    \"The only thing that distinguishes one metal from another,\" writes an  alchemist who went under the name of Philalethes, \"is its degree of  maturity, which is, of course, greatest in the most precious metals;  the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance, but of  digestion; in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to  purge out its metallic impurities. If by any means this superfluous  impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals, they  would become gold and silver. So miners tell us that lead has in many  cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth, and we contend  that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of  our Art.\"    Stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which  had been worked out long before; these stories were supposed to prove  that gold was bred in the earth. The facts that pieces of silver were  found in tin and lead mines, and gold was found in silver mines, were  adduced as proofs that, as the author of _The New Pearl of Great  Price_ says, \"Nature is continually at work changing other metals into  gold, because, though in a certain sense they are complete in  themselves, they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which  they are capable, and to which nature has destined them.\" What nature  did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop. For is not man  the crown of the world, the masterpiece of nature, the flower of the  universe; was he not given dominion over all things when the world was  created?    In asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold, and  in attempting to effect this transmutation, the alchemist was not  acting on a vague; haphazard surmise; he was pursuing a policy  dictated by his conception of the order of nature; he was following  the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself. The  transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural  philosophy. If this transmutation were impossible, the alchemical  scheme of things would be destroyed, the believer in the transmutation  would be left without a sense of order in the material universe. And,  moreover, the alchemist's conception of an orderly material universe  was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion,  that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be  to remove not only the basis of his system of material things, but the  foundations of his system of ethics also. To take away his belief in  the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert  the alchemist into an atheist.    How, then, was the transmutation to be accomplished? Evidently by the  method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things; for  the alchemist's belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled  him to regard metals as living things.    Plants are improved by appropriate culture, by digging and enriching  the soil, by judicious selection of seed; animals are improved by  careful breeding. By similar processes metals will be encouraged and  helped towards perfection. The perfect state of gold will not be  reached at a bound; it will be gained gradually. Many partial  purifications will be needed. As _Subtle_ says in _The Alchemist_--                                        'twere absurd        To think that nature in the earth bred gold        Perfect in the instant; something went before,        There must be remote matter....        Nature doth first beget the imperfect, then        Proceeds she to the perfect.    At this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical. It  may, perhaps, be rendered somewhat as follows:--    Man is the most perfect of animals; in man there is a union of three  parts, these are body, soul, and spirit. Metals also may be said to  have a body, a soul, and a spirit; there is a specific bodily, or  material, form belonging to each metal; there is a metalline soul  characteristic of this or that class of metals; there is a spirit, or  inner immaterial potency, which is the very essence of all metals.    The soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body. If the spiritual  nature is to become the dominating partner, the body must be  mortified: the alchemists, of course, used this kind of imagery, and  it was very real to them. In like manner the spirit of metals will be  laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences, only  when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed. The  first thing to do, then, is to strip off and cast aside those  properties of metals which appeal to the senses.    \"It is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw  out its soul,\" said Stephanus of Alexandria in the 7th century; and in  the 17th century Paracelsus said, \"Nothing of true value is located in  the body of a substance, but in the virtue ... the less there is of  body the more in proportion is the virtue.\"    But the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage:  mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into  another like itself; it will not suffice for the great transmutation,  for in that process a metal becomes gold, the one and only perfect  metal. Hence the soul also must be removed, in order that the spirit,  the essence, the kernel, may be obtained.    And as it is with metals, so, the alchemists argued, it is with all  things. There are a few _Principles_ which may be thought of as  conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things; beneath  these, there are certain _Elements_ which are common to many things  whose principles are not the same; and, hidden by the wrappings of  elements and principles, there is the one _Essence_, the spirit, the  mystic uniting bond, the final goal of the philosopher.    I propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions  of Elements and Principles, and in the next chapter to attempt some  kind of description of the Essence.    In his _Tract Concerning the Great Stone of the Ancient Sages_, Basil  Valentine speaks of the \"three Principles,\" salt, sulphur, and  mercury, the source of which is the Elements.    \"There are four Elements, and each has at its centre another element  which makes it what it is. These are the four pillars of the earth.\"    Of the element _Earth_, he says:--\"In this element the other three,  especially fire, are latent.... It is gross and porous, specifically  heavy, but naturally light.... It receives all that the other three  project into it, conscientiously conceals what it should hide, and  brings to light that which it should manifest.... Outwardly it is  visible and fixed, inwardly it is invisible and volatile.\"    Of the element _Water_, Basil Valentine says:--\"Outwardly it is  volatile, inwardly it is fixed, cold, and humid.... It is the solvent  of the world, and exists in three degrees of excellence: the pure, the  purer, and the purest. Of its purest substance the heavens were  created; of that which is less pure the atmospheric air was formed;  that which is simply pure remains in its proper sphere where ... it is  guardian of all subtle substances here below.\"    Concerning the element _Air_, he writes:--\"The most noble Element of  Air ... is volatile, but may be fixed, and when fixed renders all  bodies penetrable.... It is nobler than Earth or Water.... It  nourishes, impregnates, conserves the other elements.\"    Finally, of the element _Fire_:--\"Fire is the purest and noblest of  all Elements, full of adhesive unctuous corrosiveness, penetrant,  digestive, inwardly fixed, hot and dry, outwardly visible, and  tempered by the earth.... This Element is the most passive of all, and  resembles a chariot; when it is drawn, it moves; when it is not drawn,  it stands still.\"    Basil Valentine then tells his readers that Adam was compounded of the  four pure Elements, but after his expulsion from Paradise he became  subject to the various impurities of the animal creation. \"The pure  Elements of his creation were"]]]
