Several of the posts were twisted. But  the bridge across the Tugela was uninjured, and the damage to the lines  was such as could be easily repaired. The Boers realise the advantage of  the railway. At this moment, with their trains all labelled 'To Durban,'  they are drawing supplies along it from Pretoria to within six miles of  Ladysmith. They had resolved to use it in their further advance, and  their confidence in the ultimate issue is shown by the care with which  they avoid seriously damaging the permanent way. We had learned all that  there was to learn--where the line was broken, that the village was  deserted, that the bridge was safe, and we made haste to rejoin the  train. Then the engine was reversed, and we withdrew out of range of the  hills beyond Colenso at full speed--and some said that the Boers did not  fire because they hoped to draw us nearer, and others that there were no  Boers within ten miles.    On the way back I talked with the volunteer. He was friendly and  communicative. 'Durban Light Infantry,' he said; 'that's my corps. I'm a  builder myself by trade--nine men under me. But I had to send them all  away when I was called out. I don't know how I'm going on when I get  back after it's over. Oh, I'm glad to come. I wish I was in Ladysmith.  You see these Dutchmen have come quite far enough into our country. The  Imperial Government promised us protection. You've seen what protection  Colenso got; Dundee and Newcastle, just the same; I don't doubt they've  tried their best, and I don't blame them; but we want help here badly. I  don't hold with a man crying out for help unless he makes a start  himself, so I came out. I'm a cyclist. I've got eight medals at home for  cycling.'    'How will you like a new one--with the Queen's head on it?'    His eye brightened.    'Ah,' he said, 'I should treasure that more than all the other  eight--even more than the twenty-mile championship one.'    So we rattled back to Estcourt through the twilight; and the long car,  crowded with brown-clad soldiers who sprawled smoking on the floor or  lounged against the sides, the rows of loopholes along the iron walls,  the black smoke of the engine bulging overhead, the sense of headlong  motion, and the atmosphere of war made the volunteer seem perhaps more  than he was; and I thought him a true and valiant man, who had come  forward in time of trouble quietly and soberly to bear his part in  warfare, and who was ready, if necessary, to surrender his humble life  in honourably sustaining the quarrel of the State. Nor do I care to  correct the impression now.          CHAPTER VI    DISTANT GUNS      Estcourt: November 10, 1899.    When I awoke yesterday morning there was a strange tremor in the air. A  gang of platelayers and navvies were making a new siding by the station,  and sounds of hammering also came from the engine shed. But this tremor  made itself felt above these and all the other noises of a waking camp,  a silent thudding, a vibration which scarcely seemed to constitute what  is called sound, yet which left an intense impression on the ear. I went  outside the tent to listen. Morning had just broken, and the air was  still and clear. What little wind there was came from the northwards,  from the direction of Ladysmith, and I knew that it carried to Estcourt  the sound of distant cannon. When once the sounds had been localised it  was possible to examine them more carefully. There were two kinds of  reports: one almost a boom, the explosion evidently of some very heavy  piece of ordnance; the other only a penetrating whisper, that of  ordinary field guns. A heavy cannonade was proceeding. The smaller  pieces fired at brief intervals, sometimes three or four shots followed  in quick succession. Every few minutes the heavier gun or guns  intervened. What was happening? We could only try to guess, nor do we  yet know whether our guesses were right. It seems to me, however, that  Sir George White must have made an attack at dawn on some persecuting  Boer battery, and so brought on a general action.    Later in the day we rode out to find some nearer listening point. The  whole force was making a reconnaissance towards Colenso, partly for  reasons of security, partly to exercise the horses and men. Galloping  over the beautiful grassy hills to the north of the town, I soon reached  a spot whence the column could be seen. First of all came a cyclist--a  Natal volunteer pedalling leisurely along with his rifle slung across  his back--then two more, then about twenty. Next, after an interval of a  quarter of a mile, rode the cavalry--the squadron of the Imperial Light  Horse, sixty Natal Carabineers, a company of mounted infantry, and about  forty of the Natal mounted police. That is the total cavalry force in  Natal, all the rest is bottled up in Ladysmith, and scarcely three  hundred horsemen are available for the defence of the colony against a  hostile army entirely composed of mounted men. Small were their numbers,  but the quality was good. The Imperial Light Horse have shown their  courage, and have only to display their discipline to equal advantage to  be considered first-class soldiers. The Natal Carabineers are excellent  volunteer cavalry: the police an alert and reliable troop. After the  horse the foot: the Dublin Fusiliers wound up the hill like a long brown  snake. This is a fine regiment, which distinguished itself at Glencoe,  and have since impressed all who have been brought in contact with it.  The cheery faces of the Irishmen wore a proud and confident expression.  They had seen war. The other battalion--the Border Regiment--had yet  their spurs to win. The volunteer battery was sandwiched between the two  British battalions, and the rear of the column was brought up by the  Durban volunteers. The force, when it had thus passed in review, looked  painfully small, and this impression was aggravated by the knowledge of  all that depended on it.    A high, flat-topped hill to the north-west promised a wide field of  vision and a nearer listening point for the Ladysmith cannonade, which  still throbbed and thudded dully. With my two companions I rode towards  it, and after an hour's climb reached the summit. The land lay spread  before us like a map. Estcourt, indeed, was hidden by its engulfing  hills, but Colenso was plainly visible, and the tin roofs of the houses  showed in squares and oblongs of pale blue against the brown background  of the mountain. Far away to the east the dark serrated range of the  Drakensberg rose in a mighty wall. But it was not on these features  that we turned our glasses. To the right of Colenso the hills were lower  and more broken, and the country behind, though misty and indistinct,  was exposed to view. First there was a region of low rocky hills rising  in strange confusion and falling away on the further side to a hollow.  Above this extensive depression clouds of smoke from grass and other  fires hung and drifted, like steam over a cauldron. At the  bottom--invisible in spite of our great elevation--stood the town and  camp of Ladysmith. Westward rose the long, black, hog-backed outline of  Bulwana Hill, and while we watched intently the ghost of a flash stabbed  its side and a white patch sprang into existence, spread thinner, and  vanished away. 'Long Tom' was at his business.    The owner of the nearest farm joined us while we were thus engaged--a  tall, red-bearded man of grave and intelligent mien. 'They've had heavy  fighting this morning,' he said. 'Not since Monday week' (the Black  Monday of the war) 'has there been such firing. But they are nearly  finished now for the day.' Absorbed by the distant drama, all the more  thrilling since its meaning was doubtful and mysterious, we had shown  ourselves against the sky-line, and our conversation was now suddenly  interrupted. Over the crest of the hill to the rear, two horsemen  trotted swiftly into view. A hundred yards away to the left three or  four more were dismounting among the rocks. Three other figures appeared  on the other side. We were surrounded--but by the Natal Carabineers.  'Got you, I think,' said the sergeant, who now arrived. 'Will you kindly  tell us all about who you are?' We introduced ourselves as President  Kruger and General Joubert, and presented the farmer as Mr. Schreiner,  who had come to a secret conference, and having produced our passes,  satisfied the patrol that we were not eligible for capture. The sergeant  looked disappointed. 'It took us half an hour to stalk you, but if you  had only been Dutchmen we'd have had you fixed up properly.' Indeed, the  whole manoeuvre had been neatly and cleverly executed, and showed the  smartness and efficiency of these irregular forces in all matters of  scouting and reconnaissance. The patrol was then appeased by being  photographed 'for the London papers,' and we hastened to accept the  farmer's invitation to lunch. 'Only plain fare,' said he, 'but perhaps  you are used to roughing it.'    The farm stood in a sheltered angle of the hill at no great distance  from its summit. It was a good-sized house, with stone walls and a  corrugated iron roof. A few sheds and outhouses surrounded it, four or  five blue gums afforded a little shade from the sun and a little relief  to the grassy smoothness of the landscape. Two women met us at the door,  one the wife, the other, I think, the sister of our host. Neither was  young, but their smiling faces showed the invigorating effects of this  delicious air. 'These are anxious times,' said the older; 'we hear the  cannonading every morning at breakfast. What will come of it all?' Over  a most excellent luncheon we discussed many things with these kind  people, and spoke of how the nation was this time resolved to make an  end of the long quarrel with the Boers, so that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#7)"],[1,"to embrace  his mother.    \"His life was brief, but crowded; fuller of labors than of days.    \"Alas, the powerful and indefatigable laborer, the philosopher, the  thinker, the poet, the man of genius, lived among us the life of storms,  of struggles, of quarrels, of combats, common in all times to all great  men.

Let us accept them in their  poignancy and severity. It is good perhaps, and necessary, in an epoch  like ours, that from time to time a great death should communicate a  religious book to minds devoured by doubt and skepticism. Providence  knows what it does when it thus puts a whole people face to face with the  supreme mystery, and gives it Death to meditate upon, which is at once  the great equality and the great liberty.    \"Providence knows what it does, for here is the highest of instructions.  There can be in all hearts only austere and serious thoughts when a  sublime spirit majestically makes its entrance upon the other life; when  one of those beings whom the visible wings of genius have long sustained  above the crowd, suddenly puts forth those other wings that we cannot  see, and disappears in the unknown!    \"No, it is not the unknown! No, I have already said it on another mournful  occasion, and I shall not weary in repeating it, it is not darkness, it  is light! It is not the end, it is the beginning! It is not nothing, it  is eternity! Is not this true, I ask all that hear me? Such graves as  this are proofs of immortality. In the presence of the illustrious dead  we feel more distinctly the divine destinies of this intelligence called  man, which traverses the earth to suffer and to be purified; and we know  that those who have shone with genius during life, must be living souls  after death.\"           *       *       *       *       *      DR. GUTZLAFF, THE MISSIONARY.    CHARLES GUTZLAFF the famous missionary in China is described in the  _Grenzboten_ by a writer who lately heard him preach at Vienna, as a  short, stout man, with a deep red face, a large mouth, sleepy eyes,  pointed inward and downward like those of a China man, vehement  gesticulations, and a voice more loud than melodious. He has acquired  in his features and expression something like the expression of the  people among whom he lives. His whole manners also, as well as his  face, indicate the genuine son of Jao and Chun, so that the Chinese when  they encounter him in the street salute him as their countryman. We  translate for _The International_ the following sketch of his life and  labors:    Charles Gutzlaff was born in 1803, at Pyritz, a village of Pomerania. His  zeal as an apostle was first manifested some fifteen years ago. He  married an English woman, who was animated with the same aspiration as  himself and who accompanied him on his voyages as a missionary. His  extensive acquaintance with the Chinese and kindred languages even then  made deep impression on Robert Morrison, the founder of the Evangelical  Mission in China, whom he joined in 1831 at Macao, and caused his  Acquaintance to be much sought by the merchants. In 1832 and 1833 he was  employed as an interpreter on board ships engaged in smuggling opium, but  turned this occupation, which in itself was not of a very saintly  character, to his religious ends, by the dissemination of tracts and  Bibles. A missionary journey to Japan which he undertook in 1837 was  without  any result. After Morrison's death Gutzlaff was appointed  Chinese Secretary to the British Consulate at Canton, and in 1840 founded  a Christian Union of Chinese for the propagation of the Gospel among  their countrymen. His present journey through Europe has a similar  purpose, the foundation of Missionary Societies for the spread of  Christianity in China.    His literary labors have had an almost incredible extent and variety. He  Himself gives the following enumeration of his writings: \"In Dutch I have  written: a History of our Mission and of distinguished Missionaries, and  an appeal for support of the Missionary Work; in German: Sketches of the  Minor Prophets; in Latin: The Life of our Savior; in English: Sketches of  Chinese History; China Opened; Life of Kanghe, together with a great  number of articles on the Religion, History, Philosophy, Literature and  Laws of the Chinese; in Siamese: a Translation of the New Testament, with  the Psalms, and an English-Siamese Dictionary, English-Cambodian  Dictionary and English-Laos Dictionary. These works I left to my  successors to finish, but with the exception of the Siamese Dictionary  they have added nothing to them. In Cochin-Chinese: a Complete Dictionary  Cochin-Chinese-English and English-Cochin-Chinese; this work is not yet  printed. In Chinese: Forty Tracts, along with three editions of the Life  of our Savior; a Translation of the New Testament, the third edition of  which I have carried through the press. Of the Translations of the Old  Testament the Prophets and the two first books of Moses are completed. In  this language I have also written The Chinese Scientific Monthly Review,  a History of England, a History of the Jews, a Universal History and  Geography, on Commerce, a short Account of the British Empire and its  Inhabitants, as well as a number of smaller articles. In Japanese: a  Translation of the New Testament, and of the first book of Moses, two  tracts, and several scientific pamphlets. The only paper to which I now  send communications is the Hong Kong Gazette, the whole Chinese  department of which I have undertaken. Till the year 1842 I wrote for  the Chinese Archives.\"    The writer in the _Grenzboten_ goes on to say that \"so vast a surface as  these writings cover, requires a surprising facility of mind and an  indefatigable perseverance. When you see the man engaged in his  missionary toils you understand the whole at once. He arrives in a city  and hastens to the church which is prepared for his reception. After  preaching for an hour with the greatest energy he takes up his  collection and is gone. He speaks with such rapidity that it is  hardly  possible to follow him. Such rapidity is not favorable to excellence  in the work. Of all his writings, only one work is known to me, that  published in  Munich, in 1847, under the title of 'Gutzlaffs History of  the Chinese Empire from the earnest times to the Peace of Nankin'. In our  imperfect acquaintance with Chinese history this compendium is not  without value, but it displays no critical power, and is a mere external  compilation and poorly written. From it we learn as good as nothing of  the peculiar customs and state of mental culture of the country. The  whole resembles a Christian History of the World written in the  eighteenth century, Beginning with Adam and Eve, and leaving the Greeks  and Romans out altogether because they were without a divine revelation.\"    Mr. Gutzlaff's family were recently for several months in the United  States, and the proceedings of the great missionary--second in eminence  only to our own Judson--have always been regarded with much interest by  the American churches.      AUTHORS AND BOOKS    The Asiatic Society at Paris has just held its twenty-eighth yearly  session. According to the report of its Secretary and Financial  Committee, this society has suffered little from the disastrous times  which have fallen on literature generally. In 1848, being uncertain as to  the future, it stopped receiving subscriptions to works with a view to  their publication, and arrested the printing of those which were already  commenced, with the single exception of the Asiatic Journal, which the  members determined not to alter in any case. The series of this journal  is of great value, containing already fifty-five volumes, to which two  new ones are added every year. For many years it has contained only  original articles, though formerly it admitted translations from other  European languages. Of course, in so voluminous a periodical work, the  contents vary in character, but the whole is of the greatest importance  to History, Belles Lettres, and Philology, and should not be wanting in  any public library. The society has now resumed the suspended  publications, beginning with the \"Chronicles of Cashmir\", by the Austrian  Orientalist Captain Troyer, two volumes of which were issued some time  since. Troyer is a remarkable man. As an Austrian artillery and staff  officer he served in all the wars, from the breaking out of the French  Revolution to the Peace of Paris. While in Italy, he passed some time at  the head-quarters of Lord William Bentinck, as an Austrian Commissioner,  and so gained his esteem and confidence that he was invited to go with  Lord William to Madras as his military secretary. When Lord William  resigned the government of Madras, Troyer remained for some time as  Director of the East India Company's School for Artillery and Engineers,  till finally he resigned and came to Paris. In 1829, Lord William went  again to India as Governor-General, and persuaded Troyer to go with him.  While in India at this time, among other offices Troyer filled that of  Secretary of the Hindoo College. In 1834, when Bentinck again left India,  Troyer once more resigned his functions, and has since been in Paris,  devoting an active and honorable old age to constant labors upon Persian  and Indian literature.         *       *       *       *       *    The FRENCH ACADEMY held its annual public session on the 8th of August,  in the presence of a large audience, including almost all the literary  celebrities of the metropolis, "]]]
