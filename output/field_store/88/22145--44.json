Please do me the favor! Go  into the back room there and write. No one shall disturb you.    OLDENDORF (_smiling_).    You are just a vulgar intriguer!    BOLZ (_forcing him from his chair_).    Please, you'll find ink and paper there. Come, deary, come! [_He  accompanies him to the door on the left. Exit_ OLDENDORF. BOLZ  _calling after him._] Will you have a cigar? An old Henry Clay?  [_Draws a cigar-case from his pocket._] No? Don't make it too short;  it is to be the principal article! [_He shuts the door, calls through  the door on the right._] The professor is writing the article himself.  See that nobody disturbs him! [_Coming to the front._] So that is  settled.--Adelaide here in town! I'll go straight to her! Stop, keep  cool, keep cool! Old Bolz, you are no longer the brown lad from the  parsonage. And even if you were, _she_ has long since changed. Grass  has grown over the grave of a certain childish inclination. Why are  you suddenly thumping so, my dear soul? Here in town she is just as  far off from you as on her estates. [_Seating himself and playing with  a pencil._] \"Nothing like keeping cool,\" murmured the salamander as he  sat in the stove fire.    _Enter_ KORB.    KORB.    Is Mr. Bolz in?    BOLZ (_jumping up_).    Korb! My dear Korb! Welcome, heartily welcome! It is good of you not  to have forgotten me. [_Shakes hands with him._] I am very glad to see  you.    KORB.    And I even more to see you. Here we are in town. The whole village  sends greetings! From Anton the stable-boy--he is now head man--to the  old night watchman whose horn you once hung up on the top of the  tower. Oh, what a pleasure this is!    BOLZ.    How is Miss Runeck? Tell me, old chap!    KORB.    Very well indeed, now. But we have been through much. The late general  was ill for four years. It was a bad time. You know he was always an  irritable man.    BOLZ.    Yes, he was hard to manage.--    KORB.    And especially during his illness. But Miss Adelaide took care of  him, so gentle and so pale, like a perfect lamb. Now, since his death,  Miss Adelaide runs the estate, and like the best of managers. The  village is prospering again. I will tell you everything, but not until  this evening. Miss Adelaide is waiting for me; I merely ran in quickly  to tell you that we are here.    BOLZ.    Don't be in such a hurry, Korb.--So the people in the village still  think of me!    KORB.    I should say they did! No one can understand why you don't come near  us. It was another matter while the old gentleman was alive, but now--    BOLZ (_seriously_).    My parents are dead; a stranger lives in the parsonage.    KORB.    But we in the manor-house are still alive! Miss Runeck would surely be  delighted--    BOLZ.    Does she still remember me?    KORB.    Of course she does. This very day she asked about you.    BOLZ.    What did she ask, old chap?    KORB.    She asked me if it was true what people are saying, that you have  grown very wild, make debts, run after girls, and are up to the devil  generally.    BOLZ.    Good gracious! You stood up for me, I trust?    KORB.    Of course! I told her that all that might be taken for granted with  you.    BOLZ.    Confound it! That's what she thinks of me, is it? Tell me, Korb, Miss  Adelaide has many suitors, has she not?    KORB.    The sands of the sea are as nothing to it.    BOLZ (_vexed_).    But yet she can finally choose only one, I suppose.    KORB (_slyly_).    Correct! But which one? That's the question.    BOLZ.    Which do you think it will be?    KORB.    Well, that is difficult to say. There is this Mr. von Senden who is  now living in town. If any one has a chance it is probably he. He  fusses about us like a weasel. Just as I was leaving he sent to the  house a whole dozen of admission cards to the great fete at the club.  It must be the sort of club where the upper classes go arm-in-arm with  the townspeople.    BOLZ.    Yes, it is a political society of which Senden is a director. It is  casting out a great net for voters. And the Colonel and the ladies are  going?    KORB.    I hear they are. I, too, received a card.    BOLZ (_to himself_).    Has it come to this? Poor Oldendorf!--And Adelaide at the club fete of  Mr. von Senden!    KORB (_to himself_).    How am I going to begin and find out about his love-affairs?  (_Aloud._) Oh, see here, Mr. Conrad, one thing more! Have you possibly  some real good friend in this concern to whom you could introduce me?    BOLZ.    Why, old chap?    KORB.    It is only--I am a stranger here, and often have commissions and  errands where I need advice. I should like to have some one to consult  should you chance to be away, or with whom I could leave word for you.    BOLZ.    You will find me here at almost any time of day. [_At the door._]  Bellmaus! [_Enter_ BELLMAUS.] You see this gentleman here. He is an  honored old friend of mine from my native village. Should he happen  not to find me here, you take my place.--This gentleman's name is  Bellmaus, and he is a good fellow.    KORB.    I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Bellmaus.    BELLMAUS.    And I to make yours. You have not told me his name yet.    BOLZ.    Korb. He has had a great deal to carry in his life, and has often  carried me on his back, too.    BELLMAUS.    I too am pleased, Mr. Korb. [_They shake hands._]    KORB.    Well, that is in order, and now I must go or Miss Adelaide will be  waiting.    BOLZ.    Good-by! Hope to see you very soon again.    [_Exit_ KORB; _exit_ BELLMAUS _through door on the right._]    BOLZ (_alone_).    So this Senden is courting her! Oh, that is bitter!    _Enter_ HENNING, _followed by_ MILLER.    HENNING (_in his dressing-gown, hurriedly, with a printed roll in his  hand_).    Your servant, Mr. Bolz! Is \"opponent\" spelt with one p or with two  p's? The new proofreader has corrected it one p.    BOLZ (_deep in his thoughts_).    Estimable Mr. Henning, the _Union_ prints it with two p's.    HENNING.    I said so at once. [_To_ MILLER.] It must be changed; the press is  waiting.    [_Exit_ MILLER _hastily._]    I took occasion to read the leading article. Doubtless you wrote it  yourself. It is very good, but too sharp, Mr. Bolz. Pepper and  mustard--that will give offense; it will cause bad blood.    BOLZ (_still deep in his thoughts, violently_).    I always did have an antipathy to this man!    [Illustration: _Permission Union Deutsche Verlagsgesellschaft,  Stuttgart_. NATURE ENTHUSIASTS. ADOLPH VON MENZEL]    HENNING (_hurt_).    How? What? Mr. Bolz? You have an antipathy to me?    BOLZ.    To whom? No, dear Mr. Henning, you are a good fellow and would be the  best newspaper owner in the world, if only you were not often as  frightened as a hare. [_Embraces him._] My regards to Mrs. Henning,  sir, and leave me alone. I am thinking up my next article.    HENNING (_while he is being thrust out_).    But do, please, write very moderately and kindly, dear Mr. Bolz.    BOLZ (_alone, walking to and fro again_).    Senden avoids me whenever he can. He stands things from me that any  one else would strongly resent. Is it possible that he suspects--    _Enter_ MILLER.    MILLER (_hurriedly_).    A lady I don't know wishes to pay her respects to you.    BOLZ.    A lady! And to me?    MILLER.    To the editor. [_Hands him a card._]    BOLZ (_reads_).    Leontine Pavoni-Gessler, _nee_ Melloni from Paris. She must have to do  with art. Is she pretty?    MILLER.    H'm! So, so!    BOLZ.    Then tell her we are very sorry that we cannot have the pleasure, that  it is the editor's big washing-day.    MILLER.    What?    BOLZ (_vehemently_).    Washing, children's washing. That we are sitting up to the elbows in  soapsuds.    MILLER (_laughing_).    And I am to--    BOLZ (_impatiently_).    You're a blockhead! [_At the door._] Bellmaus! [_Enter_ BELLMAUS.]  Stay here and receive the visitor. [_Gives him the card._]    BELLMAUS.    Ah, that is the new ballet-dancer who is expected here. [_Inspecting  his coat._] But I'm not dressed for it!    BOLZ.    All the more dressed she will be. [_To_ MILLER.] Show the lady in.    [_Exit_ MILLER.]    BELLMAUS.    But really I cannot--    BOLZ (_irritably_).    Oh the devil, don't put on airs! [_Goes to the table, puts papers in  the drawer, seizes his hat._]    _Enter_ MADAME PAVONI.    MADAME PAVONI.    Have I the honor of seeing before me the editor of the _Union_?    BELLMAUS (_bowing_).    To be sure--that is to say--won't you kindly be seated? [_Pushes up  chairs._]    BOLZ.    Adelaide is clear-sighted and clever. How can she possibly fail to see  through that fellow?    MADAME PAVONI.    Mr. Editor, the intelligent articles about art which adorn your  paper--have prompted me--    BELLMAUS.    Oh, please!    BOLZ. (_having made up his mind_).    I must gain entrance into this club-fete!    [_Exit with a bow to the lady._ BELLMAUS _and_ MADAME PAVONI _sit  facing each other._]          ACT II      SCENE I      _The_ COLONEL'S _summer parlor. In the foreground on the right_ IDA  _and_ ADELAIDE, _next to_ ADELAIDE _the_ COLONEL, _all sitting. In  front of them a table with coffee set._    COLONEL (_in conversation with_ ADELAIDE, _laughing_).    A splendid story, and cleverly told! I am heartily glad that you are  with us, dear Adelaide. Now, at any rate, we shall talk about  something else at table besides this everlasting politics! H'm! The  professor has not come today. He never used to miss our coffee-hour.    [_Pause;_ ADELAIDE _and_ IDA _look at each other._ IDA _sighs._]    ADELAIDE.    Perhaps he has work to do.    IDA.    Or he is vexed with us because I am going to the fete tonight.

Another penny bank was opened in Granville Street, April 13,  1861, and is still carried on at the Immanuel Schools, Tennant Street,  with about 5,000 depositors at the present time.    A Local Savings Bank was opened in May, 1827, and legalised in the year  after, but ultimately its business was transferred to the Post Office  Savings Bank, which opened its doors in Cannon Street, Dec. 1, 1863. By  a Government return, it appeared that at the end of 1880 the total  amount to the credit of depositors in the Post Office Savings Banks of  the Kingdom stood at L30,546,306. After the Metropolitan counties of  Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent, Warwickshire comes next with a deposit of  L1,564,815, the average for the whole of the English counties being but  little over L500,000.    ~Banks Defunct.~--The old-established concern known so long as Attwood  and Spooner's closed its doors March 10, 1865, with liabilities  amounting to L1,007,296. The Joint Stock Bank took the business, and  paid 11s. 3d. in the L.    Bank of Deposit stopped Oct. 26, 1861.    The Borough Bank, a branch of Northern and Central Bank of England,  stopped Feb. 24, 1840.    The Commercial (Branch) Bank, closed July 27, 1840.    Coates, Woolley and Gordon, who occupied the premises at corner of  Cherry Street and Cannon Street in 1814, was joined to Moilliet's, and  by them to Lloyds.    Freer, Rotton, Lloyds and Co., of 1814, changed to Rotton, Onions and  Co., then Rotton and Scholefield, next to Rotton and Son, and lastly  with its manager transferred to National Provincial.    Galton, Galton and James, of 1814, retired in 1830.    Gibbins, Smith, and Co. failed in 1825, paying nearly 20s. in the L.    Gibbins and Lowell, opened in 1826, but was joined to Birmingham Banking  Co. in 1829.    Smith, Gray, Cooper and Co., of 1815, afterwards Gibbins, Smith, and  Goode, went in 1825.    ~Banknotes.~--Notes for 5/3 were issued in 1773. 300 counterfeit L1  notes, dated 1814, were found near Heathfield House, January 16, 1858. A  noted forger of these shams is said to have resided in the immediate  neighbourhood about the period named on the discovered \"flimsies.\" When  Boulton and Watt were trying to get the Act passed patenting their  copying-press the officials of the Bank of England opposed it for fear  it should lead to forgery of their notes, and several Members of  Parliament actually tried to copy banknotes as they did their letters.    ~Bankrupts.~--In the year 1882 (according to the _Daily Post_) there  were 297 bankruptcies, compositions, or liquidations in Birmingham, the  total amount of debts being a little over L400,000. The dividends ranged  from 2d. to 15s. in the L, one-half the whole number, however, realising  under 1s. 6d. The estimated aggregate loss to creditors is put at  L243,000.    ~Baptists.~--As far back as 1655, we have record of meetings or  conferences of the Baptist churches in the Midland district, their  representatives assembling at Warwick on the second day of the third  month, and at Moreton-in-the-Marsh, on the 26th of the fourth month in  that year. Those were the Cromwellian days of religious freedom, and we  are somewhat surprised that no Birmingham Baptists should be among those  who gathered together at the King's Head, at Moreton, on the last named  date, as we find mention made of brethren from Warwick, Tewkesbury,  Alcester, Derby, Bourton-on-the-Water, Hook Norton,  Moreton-in-the-Marsh, and even of there being a community of the same  persuasion at Cirencester. The conference of the Midland Counties'  District Association of Baptist Churches met in this town for the first  time in 1740.--For Chapels see \"_Places of Worship_.\"    ~Barr Beacon.~--A trial was made on January 10, 1856, as to how far a  light could be seen by the ignition of a beacon on Malvern Hills. It was  said to have been seen from Snowdon in Wales (105 miles), and at other  parts of the country at lesser distances, though the gazers at Worcester  saw it not. The look-out at Dudley Castle (26 miles) could have passed  the signal on to Barr Beacon, but it was not needed, as the Malvern  light was not only seen there, but still away on at Bardon Hill,  Leicester.--Many persons imagine that Barr Beacon is the highest spot in  the Midland Counties, but the idea is erroneous, Turners Hill, near Lye  Cross, Rowley Regis, which is 893 ft. above mean sea level, being  considerably higher, while the Clee Hills reach an altitude of 1,100 ft.    ~Barber of Birmingham, The.~--The knights of the pole (or poll) have  always been noted for getting into mischief, and it is not therefore so  very surprising to find that in March, 1327, a royal pardon had to be  granted to \"Roger, the barber of Birmingham,\" for the part he had taken  in the political disturbances of that time. Was he a Con., or a Lib.,  Tory or Rad.?    ~Baron of Birmingham.~--One of the titles of Lord Ward.    ~Barracks.~--Built in 1793, at a cost of L13,000, as a consequence of  the riots of 1791.    ~Barring Out~--On the 26th of Nov. 1667, the scholars of the Grammar  School \"barred out\" the Master, and then left the school for a time.  When they returned they found the worthy pedagogue had obtained  admission and intended to keep his young rebels outside. Whereupon, says  an old chronicler, they, being reinforced by certain of the townsmen \"in  vizards, and with pistolls and other armes,\" sought to re-enter by  assault, threatening to kill the Master, and showering stones and bricks  through the windows. When the fun was over the Governors passed a law  that any boy taking part in future \"barrings-out\" should be expelled  from the School, but the amusement seems to have been rather popular, as  an entry in the School records some ten years later show that a certain  Widow Spooner was paid one shilling \"for cleansinge ye Schoole at  penninge out.\"    ~Baskerville (John).~--This celebrated local worthy was a native of  Wolverley, near Kidderminster, having been born in the year 1706. He  came to this town in early life, as we find that he kept a writing  school in 1726. In 1745 he built himself a residence at Easy-hill, and  carried on the business of japanner afterwards adding to it that of  printer and typefounder. His achievements in this line have made his  name famous for ever, though it is said that he spent L600 before he  could produce one letter to his own satisfaction, and some thousands  before he obtained any profits from his printing trade. He was somewhat  eccentric in personal matters of dress and taste, his carriage (drawn by  cream-coloured horses) being a wonderful specimen of the art of  japanning in the way of pictured panels, etc., while he delighted to  adorn his person in the richest style of dress. The terms of his  peculiar will, and his apparent renunciation of Christianity, were  almost as curious as his choice of a place of sepulture. He was buried  in his own grounds under a solid cone of masonry, where his remains lay  until 1821, at which time the canal wharf, now at Easy Row, was being  made. His body was found in a good state of preservation, and for some  short period was almost made a show of, until by the kindness of Mr.  Knott the bookseller, it was taken to Us present resting-place in one of  the vaults under Christ Church. Mr. Baskerville died January 8, 1775,  his widow living till March 21, 1787, to the age of 80 years.    ~Baths.~--Ladywell Baths were said by Hutton to be the most complete in  the island, being seven in number, that for swimmers 36 yards long by 18  wide, and cost L2,000. The place is now occupied by a timber yard, the  old spring being covered in, though fitted with a pump for public use.  For many years a tribe of water carriers procured a living by retailing  the water at a halfpenny per can. The red sand from the New Street  tunnels was turned to account in tilling up the old baths, much to the  advantage of Mr. Turner, the lessee, and of the hauliers who turned the  honest penny by turning in so near at hand.    ~Baths and Wash-houses.~--The local movement for the establishment of  public Baths first took practical shape at a meeting held Nov. 19,1844,  within a week of which date subscriptions amounting to L4,430 were  received for the purpose. The Association then formed purchased a plot  of land in Kent Street in June, 1846, and presented it to the Town  Council in November following, though the Baths erected thereon were not  opened to the public until May 12, 1851. It was at that time imagined  that the working classes would be glad of the boon provided for them in  the convenient wash-houses attached to the Baths proper, and the chance  given them to do away with all the sloppy, steamy annoyances of  washing-day at home, but the results proved otherwise, and the  wash-houses turned out to be not wanted. The Woodcock Street  establishment was opened August 27, 1860; Northwood Street, March 5,  1862; Sheepcote Street in 1878, and Ladywood in 1882. Turkish Baths are  now connected with the above, and there are also private speculations of  the same kind in High Street, Broad Street, and the Crescent. Hardy  swimmers, who prefer taking their natatory exercises in the open air,  will find provision made for them at the Reservoir, at Cannon Hill Park,  and also at Small Heath Park. The swimming-bath in George Street,  Balsall Heath, opened in 1846, was filled up in 1878, by order of the  Local Board of Health.    ~Bath Street~ takes its name from some baths formerly in Blews Street,  but which, about 1820, were turned into a malthouse.    ~Battle Of the Alma.~--A disturbance which took place at a steeplechase  meeting at Aston, Monday, March 26, 1855, received this grandiloquent  title.    ~Battles and Sieges.~--It is more than probable that the British, under  their gallant Queen Boadicea, fought the Romans more than once in the  near vicinity of this district, and very possibly in those happy days of"]]]
