I'll  kill him!\" cried the boy, with vehemence. \"Oh no, I know what I'll do!  Here Ranger! here Ranger!\" and starting up he rushed away in a direction  to take him farther from the schoolhouse and the rest of his party.    He had spied in the distance a farmer's boy, a lad of fourteen, with whom  he had some slight acquaintance. \"Hallo, Jared Bates!\" he shouted.    \"Well, what's wantin'?\" and Jared stood still, drawing the lash of his  carter's whip slowly between his fingers. \"Hurry up now, for I've got to  go back to my team. Whose dog's that?\" as Ranger came running up and  saluted him with a sharp, \"Bow, wow, wow!\"    \"Ours,\" said Archie, \"and I'm mad at him 'cause he killed a bird and tried  to bite Vi Travilla, when she went to take it from him.\"    \"Like enough,\" returned Jared, grinning. \"But what about it?\"    \"I thought may be you'd like to have him.\"    \"So I would, what'll you sell him for?\"    \"Ten cents.\"    \"I hain't got but two.\"    \"Haven't you, Jared? truly, now?\"    \"No, nary red, 'cept them,\" and diving into his pantaloons' pocket, Jared  produced a handful of odds and ends--a broken knife, a plug of tobacco,  some rusty nails, a bit of twine, etc.,--from which he picked out two  nickels. \"There, them's um, and they's all I got in the world,\" he said  gravely, passing them over to Archie.    \"Well, it's very cheap,\" observed the latter, pocketing the cash, \"but you  can have him. Good-bye,\" and away he ran back to the spot where he had  left Vi.    \"You're a green 'un!\" laughed Jared, looking after him; then whistling to  the dog to follow, he went on his way.          CHAPTER SEVENTH.        \"But this I say, he which soweth sparingly shall reap also      sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also      bountifully.\"        --2 COR. ix. 6.      All the children, Gertrude excepted, were gathered on the front porch, Vi  with the dead bird in her hands, when the carriage drove up with the  returning travelers.    There was a glad chorus of welcome, and most of the young faces were  bright and happy. Elsie's troop had nothing but smiles, caresses and  loving words for her, and tender, anxious inquiries about \"Sister Elsie;  if the tooth were out?\" \"if the dentist hurt her much?\"    \"It was hard to bear,\" she said, \"but the doctor was very kind, and tried  not to hurt her. And, oh, mamma had made her such a lovely present, for  being brave and willing to have her tooth out.\" And she took a beautiful  little gold watch and chain from her bosom, and held them up to their  admiring gaze.    \"Oh, I'm so glad, so glad! Dear mamma, how good of you!\" cried Vi, without  a touch of envy embracing first her sister, and then her mother.    Eddie and the two younger ones seemed equally pleased, and \"sister Elsie\"  allowed each in turn to closely inspect, her treasure.    In the meantime, Mr. and Mrs. Ross had been busy bestowing caresses and  small gifts upon their children, who received them with noisy glee mingled  with some reproaches because they had been left at home.    \"Come, come, no complaints,\" said their father; \"I think you have fared  well;--a holiday, a picnic, and these pretty presents. Where's Gertrude?\"    \"Sure enough, where is she?\" asked Lucy, looking round from one to  another.    \"She's mad because you did not take her along,\" remarked Harry, \"she says  you didn't keep your promise.\"    \"Dear me, I'd forgotten all about it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Ross. \"I should have  taken her though, but there wasn't time to get her up and dressed.\"    \"Gertrude! Gertrude!\" called Mr. Ross, in tones of authority, \"Gertrude,  come here and show yourself.\"    At that the child came slowly out from the hall--whence she had been  watching the scene through the crack behind the door--looking red and  angry.    \"What's the matter with you?\" asked her father, with some displeasure in  his tones.    \"Nothing, I'm not crying.\"    \"Nor pouting either, I suppose? What's it all about.\"    \"Mamma promised to take me along the next time she went to the city.\"    \"Perhaps she will the next time.\"    \"But this was the next time, because she promised it when she went before  and took Kate.\"    \"Well, such promises are always conditional; she took no one this time  (but me), and there was a good reason why.\"    Gertrude smiled slightly, then laughed outright, as she glanced up into  his face, saying, \"I thought it was you, papa, that took mamma.\"    \"Oh! now, you begin to look something like the little girl I'm used to  hearing called Gertrude Ross; the one I like to buy presents for; the  other one that was here just a moment ago, gets nothing bought with my  money.\"    \"See here,\" said her mother, and with a cry of delight Gertrude sprang  forward and caught from her hand a watch and chain very nearly the  counterparts of those little Elsie was displaying to her sister and  brothers.    \"Oh, joy, joy!\" she cried, dancing up and down, \"thank you, mamma! Thank  you, papa! I'd rather have this than a dozen visits to New York. See,  Kate, isn't it a beauty?\"    \"Yes,\" returned her sister sullenly; \"but I don't see why you should have  a watch and I only this ring; you're hardly more than a year older than I  am and not a bit better girl\"    \"Come, come, don't pout, Kitty,\" said her father, stroking her hair;  \"your time will come. Harry's and Archie's too, and even little Sophie's,\"  he added, catching the household pet up in his arms, to give her a hug and  kiss.    It was not until after tea that Mr. Ross missed his dog. \"Where's Ranger?\"  he asked of one of the servants.    \"Dade, sir, I don't know,\" she answered. \"Sure he went to the picnic wid  the rest of the childer, an' it's meself as hasn't seen him since.\"    \"Harry,\" stepping out on the porch where the children, except the very  little ones, who had already been sent up to bed, were sitting listlessly  about, too weary with the day's sports to care for anymore active  amusement, \"where's Ranger?\"    \"Ranger?\" cried Harry with a start, \"why sure enough, I haven't seen him  since he came home! and I don't think he came with us either.\"    \"No, he didn't,\" said several young voices.    \"I wonder where he can be,\" pursued Harry. \"Shall I go and look for him,  papa?\"    Mr. Ross was about to say yes, when his eye fell upon the face of his  youngest son who, he noticed, looked very red and somewhat troubled. \"What  do you know about it, Archie?\" he asked; \"can you tell us what has become  of Ranger?\"    \"He behaved very bad indeed, papa,\" stammered the boy; \"he killed a dear  little bird and tried to bite Vi, and me too--and I sold him.\"    The truth was out and Archie heaved a sigh of relief.    \"Sold him?\" repeated his father in a tone of mingled surprise and  displeasure.    \"Yes, sir: to Jared Bates, for two cents. Here they are: I s'pose they  belong to you,\" said the little fellow tugging at his pocket.    \"For two cents!\" exclaimed Mr. Ross laughing in spite of himself. \"You'll  never grow rich, my boy, making such bargains as that. But see here,\" he  added, growing grave again, \"whose dog was it?\"    \"I--I thought it was ours, papa.\"    \"Ours? Yours to play with, but only mine to sell or give away. You'll have  to go to Jared to-morrow, return his two cents, and tell him the dog is  mine, and you sold what did not belong to you.\"    \"Oh where's my bird?\" cried Violet, reminded of it by this little episode.  \"I laid it down to look at Elsie's watch, and oh it's gone! Mamma, mamma,  I'm so sorry!\"    \"I am too, dear, for your sake,\" the mother said, putting an arm about her  and kissing the wet cheek, for the tears had begun to flow again. \"Was it  the bird Ranger killed?\"    \"Yes, mamma, I was going to ask you to get it stuffed for me.\"    \"Some cat has got it, no doubt,\" said Mr. Ross. \"But don't cry: it  couldn't hurt it, you know, after it was dead.\"    \"If it only had a heaven to go to,\" sobbed Vi    \"Perhaps it has,\" said the gentleman kindly. \"I really don't think,\"  turning to Mrs. Travilla, \"that the Bible says anything to the contrary;  it seems to me to simply leave the matter in doubt.\"    \"I know,\" she answered thoughtfully, \"that it is the generally accepted  belief that there is no hereafter for the lower animals; yet it has  occurred to me, too, that the Bible does not positively assert it; and  some of the poor creatures have such a suffering life in this world that  it makes my heart ache to think there is no other for them\"    \"Papa,\" asked Archie, \"don't you think Ranger deserved to be sold for  killing that bird and trying to bite Vi?\"    \"That's a question you should have propounded before selling him, that and  another; 'May I sell him.'\"    \"I wish you'd let Phelim go and buy him back,\" remarked the boy, looking  very uncomfortable at the thought of having to do the errand himself.    \"No, sir,\" returned the father decidedly, \"the mischief you have done you  must undo yourself. Ah, Harry, go and ask if any letters came to-day.\"    \"I asked,\" said Gertrude. \"There was just one; from Phil,\" and she drew it  from her pocket and handed it to her father.    \"What does he say?\" Mrs. Ross inquired when he had glanced over it.    \"Not much, except that he's to be here to-morrow, and wants the carriage  sent to the depot for him,\" he answered, handing it to her.    \"Good!\" said Gertrude, with much satisfaction. \"We always have more fun  when Phil's at home.\"    \"Except when he picks a quarrel with you or some of us,\" remarked Harry.    \"For shame, Hal!\" said his mother. \"The quarrels, if there are any, are as  likely to be begun by you, as any one else.\"    Lucy was proud and fond of her first-born, and always ready to shield him  from blame. He was in his mother's eyes as the king, who could do no  wrong, but to others a spoiled child, a wilful, headstrong, domineering  boy.

There was once a jeweler, noted for many virtues. One day, the Jewish  elders came to him to buy some diamonds, to put upon that part of the  dress of their high priest, which the Bible calls an ephod.    2. They told him what they wanted, and offered him a fair price for the  diamonds. He replied that he could not let them see the jewels at that  moment, and requested them to call again.    3. As they wanted them without delay, and thought that the object of the  jeweler was only to increase the price of the diamonds, the elders offered  him twice, then three times, as much as they were worth. But he still  refused, and they went away in very bad humor.    4. Some hours after, he went to them, and placed before them the diamonds,  for which they again offered him the last price they had named; but he  said, \"I will only accept the first one you offered to me this morning.\"    5. \"Why, then, did you not close with us at once?\" asked they in surprise.  \"When you came,\" replied he, \"my father had the key of the chest, in which  the diamonds were kept, and as he was asleep, I should have been obliged  to wake him to obtain them.    6. \"At his age, a short hour of sleep does him a great deal of good; and  for all the gold in the world, I would not be wanting in respect to my  father, or take from him a single comfort.\"    7. The elders, affected by these feeling words, spread their hands upon  the jeweler's head, and said, \"Thou shalt be blessed of Him who has said,  'Honor thy father and thy mother;' and thy children shall one day pay thee  the same respect and love thou hast shown to thy father.\"      DEFINITIONS.--l. Jew'el-er, one who buys and sells precious stones.  Not'ed, well known. Eld'er, an officer of the Jewish church.

Johnson is the authoress of  \"To-morrow,\" one of a collection  of poems; entitled \"Poems of Home Life.\"    1. A bright, merry boy, with laughing face,     Whose every motion was full of grace,     Who knew no trouble and feared no care,     Was the light of our household--the youngest there.    2. He was too young, this little elf,     With troublesome questions to vex himself;     But for many days a thought would rise,     And bring a shade to his dancing eyes.    3. He went to one whom he thought more wise     Than any other beneath the skies;     \"Mother,\"--O word that makes the home!--     \"Tell me, when will to-morrow come?\"    4. \"It is almost night,\" the mother said,     \"And time for my boy to be in bed;     When you wake up and it's day again,     It will be to-morrow, my darling, then.\"    5. The little boy slept through all the night,     But woke with the first red streak of light;     He pressed a kiss to his mother's brow,     And whispered, \"Is it to-morrow now?\"    6. \"No, little Eddie, this is to-day:     To-morrow is always one night away.\"     He pondered a while, but joys came fast,     And this vexing question quickly passed.    7. But it came again with the shades of night;     \"Will it be to-morrow when it is light?\"     From years to come he seemed care to borrow,     He tried so hard to catch to-morrow.    8. \"You can not catch it, my little Ted;     Enjoy to-day,\" the mother said;     \"Some wait for to-morrow through many a year     It is always coming, but never is here.\"      DEFINITIONS.--1. House'hold,  family, those living in the same house. 2.  Elf, a small fairy-like person. Vex, worry, trouble. Pon'dered, thought  anxiously. A-while', for a short time.

Henry Bond was about ten years old when his father died. His mother  found it difficult to provide for the support of a large family, thus left  entirely in her care. By good management, however, she contrived to do so,  and also to send Henry, the oldest, to school, and to supply him, for the  most part, with such books as he needed.    2. At one time, however, Henry wanted a grammar, in order to join a class  in that study, and his mother could not furnish him with the money to buy  it. He was very much troubled about it, and went to bed with a heavy  heart, thinking what could be done.    3. On waking in the morning, he found that a deep snow had fallen, and the  cold wind was blowing furiously. \"Ah,\" said he, \"it is an ill wind that  blows nobody good.\"    4. He rose, ran to the house of a neighbor, and offered his service to  clear a path around his premises. The offer was accepted. Having completed  this work, and received his pay, he went to another place for the same  purpose, and then to another, until he had earned enough to buy a grammar.    5. When school commenced, Henry was in his seat, the happiest boy there,  ready to begin the lesson in his new book.    6. From that time, Henry, was always the first in all his classes. He knew  no such word as fail, but always succeeded in all he attempted. Having the  will, he always found the way.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Man'age-ment, manner of directing things. 2. Fur'nish, to  supply. 3. Fu'ri-ous-ly, violently. 4. Serv'ice, labor. Prem'i-ses,  grounds around a house.        XIII. PICCOLA. (48)    By Celia Laighton Thaxter, who was born at Portsmouth, N. H., June 29,  1836. Much of her childhood was passed at White Island, one of the Isles  of Shoals, off the coast of New Hampshire. \"Among the Isles of Shoals,\" is  her most noted work in prose. She published a volume of poems, many of  which are favorites with children. She died in 1894.    1. Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear     What happened to Piccola, children dear?     'T is seldom Fortune such favor grants     As fell to this little maid of France.    2. 'T was Christmas time, and her parents poor     Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,     Striving with poverty's patient pain     Only to live till summer again.    3. No gift for Piccola! sad were they     When dawned the morning of Christmas day!     Their little darling no joy might stir;     St. Nicholas nothing would bring to her!    4. But Piccola never doubted at all     That something beautiful must befall     Every child upon Christmas day,     And so she slept till the dawn was gray.    5. And full of faith, when at last she woke,     She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;     Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,     'T was plain St. Nicholas had been there.    6. In rushed Piccola, sweet, half wild--     Never was seen such a joyful child--     \"See what the good saint brought!\" she cried,     And mother and father must peep inside.    7. Now such a story I never heard!     There was a little shivering bird!     A sparrow, that in at the window flew,     Had crept into Piccola's tiny shoe!    8. \"How good poor Piccola must have been!\"     She cried, as happy as any queen,     While the starving sparrow she fed and warmed,     And danced with rapture, she was so charmed.    9. Children, this story I tell to you     Of Piccola sweet and her bird, is true.     In the far-off land of France, they say,     Still do they live to this very day.      DEFINITIONS.--3. Dawned, began to grow light. Stir, excite. 4. Be-fall,  happen. 7. Shiv'er-ing, trembling from cold. Ti'ny, very small. 8.  Rapture, great joy. Charmed, greatly.      EXERCISES.--What is meant by \"driving the wolf from the door\"? In the  third stanza, what does \"St.\" before Nicholas mean? Who is St. Nicholas?  What did Piccola find in her shoe on Christmas morning?        XIV. TRUE MANLINESS. (50)    By MRS. M. O. JOHNSON.--(ADAPTED.)    1. \"Please, mother, do sit down and let me try my hand,\" said Fred Liscom,  a bright, active boy twelve years old. Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn,  was moving languidly about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had  scarcely tasted.    2. She smiled, and said, \"You, Fred, you wash dishes?\" \"Yes, indeed,  mother,\" replied Fred; \"I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when  I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.\"    3. A look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in  her low rocking-chair. Fred washed the dishes, and put them in the closet.  He then swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for  the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.    4. Fred's father was away from home, and as there was some cold meat in  the pantry, Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred  hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.    5. He kept on in this way for two or three days, till his mother was able  to resume her usual work, and he felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who  happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would  have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\"    6."]]]
