When put  in a bowl, add a little salt, white sugar, and nutmeg.      EGG GRUEL.    This is at once food and medicine. Some people have very great faith  in its efficacy in cases of chronic dysentery. It is made thus: Boil  a pint of new milk; beat four new-laid eggs to a light froth, and pour  in while the milk boils; stir them together thoroughly, but do not  let them boil; sweeten it with the best of loaf sugar, and grate in  a whole nutmeg; add a little salt, if you like it. Drink half of it  while it is warm, and the other half in two hours.      ARROW-ROOT JELLY.    Put about a pint of water in a skillet to boil; stir up a large  spoonful of arrow-root powder in a cup of water; pour it into the  skillet while the water is boiling; let them boil together three or  four minutes. Season it with nutmeg and loaf sugar. This is very  light food for an invalid. When the system is in a relaxed state, two  tea-spoonfuls of brandy may be put in. Milk and loaf sugar boiled, and  a spoonful of fine flour, well mixed with a little cold water, poured  in while the milk is boiling, is light food in cases of similar  diseases.      CALF'S FOOT JELLY.    Boil four feet in a gallon of water, till it is reduced to a quart.  Strain it, and let it stand, till it is quite cool. Skim off the fat,  and add to the jelly one pint of wine, half a pound of sugar, the  whites of six eggs, and the juice of four large lemons; boil all these  materials together eight or ten minutes. Then strain into the glasses,  or jars, in which you intend to keep it. Some lay a few bits of the  lemon-peel at the bottom, and let it be strained upon them.      TAPIOCA JELLY.    Wash it two or three times, soak it five or six hours; simmer it in  the same water with bits of fresh lemon-peel until it becomes quite  clear; then put in lemon juice, wine and loaf sugar.      SAGO JELLY.    The sago should be soaked in cold water an hour, and washed  thoroughly; simmered with lemon-peel and a few cloves. Add wine  and loaf sugar when nearly done; and let it all boil together a few  minutes.      BEEF TEA.    Beef tea, for the sick, is made by broiling a tender steak nicely,  seasoning it with pepper and salt, cutting it up, and pouring water  over it, not quite boiling. Put in a little water at a time, and let  it stand to soak the goodness out.      WINE WHEY.    Wine whey is a cooling and safe drink in fevers. Set half a pint of  sweet milk at the fire, pour in one glass of wine, and let it remain  perfectly still, till it curdles; when the curds settle, strain it,  and let it cool. It should not get more than blood-warm. A spoonful of  rennet-water hastens the operation. Made palatable with loaf sugar and  nutmeg, if the patient can bear it.      APPLE WATER.    This is given as sustenance when the stomach is too weak to bear  broth, &c. It may be made thus,--Pour boiling water on roasted apples;  let them stand three hours, then strain and sweeten lightly:--Or it  may be made thus,--Peel and slice tart apples, add some sugar and  lemon-peel; then pour some boiling water over the whole, and let it  stand covered by the fire, more than an hour.      MILK PORRIDGE.    Boil new milk; stir flour thoroughly into some cold milk in a bowl,  and pour it into the kettle while the milk is boiling: let it all  boil six or eight minutes. Some people like it thicker than others;  I should think three large spoonfuls of flour to a quart of milk  was about right. It should always be seasoned with salt; and if the  patient likes, loaf sugar and nutmeg may be put in. In cases of fever,  little salt or spice should be put into any nourishment; but in cases  of dysentery, salt and nutmeg may be used freely: in such cases too,  more flour should be put in porridge, and it should be boiled very  thoroughly indeed.      STEWED PRUNES.    Stew them very gently in a small quantity of water, till the stones  slip out. Physicians consider them safe nourishment in fevers.           *       *       *       *       *          VEGETABLES.      Parsnips should be kept down cellar, covered up in sand, entirely  excluded from the air. They are good only in the spring.    Cabbages put into a hole in the ground will keep well during the  winter, and be hard, fresh, and sweet, in the spring. Many farmers  keep potatoes in the same way.    Onions should be kept very dry, and never carried into the cellar  except in severe weather, when there is danger of their freezing. By  no means let them be in the cellar after March; they will sprout and  spoil. Potatoes should likewise be carefully looked to in the spring,  and the sprouts broken off. The cellar is the best place for them,  because they are injured by wilting; but sprout them carefully, if you  want to keep them. They never sprout but three times; therefore, after  you have sprouted them three times, they will trouble you no more.    Squashes should never be kept down cellar when it is possible to  prevent it. Dampness injures them. If intense cold makes it necessary  to put them there, bring them up as soon as possible, and keep them in  some dry, warm place.    Cabbages need to be boiled an hour; beets an hour and a half. The  lower part of a squash should be boiled half an hour; the neck pieces  fifteen or twenty minutes longer. Parsnips should boil an hour, or  an hour and a quarter, according to size. New potatoes should boil  fifteen or twenty minutes; three quarters of an hour, or an hour, is  not too much for large, old potatoes; common-sized ones, half an hour.  In the spring, it is a good plan to cut off a slice from the seed end  of potatoes before you cook them. The seed end is opposite to that  which grew upon the vine; the place where the vine was broken off  may be easily distinguished. By a provision of nature, the seed end  becomes watery in the spring; and, unless cut off, it is apt to injure  the potato. If you wish to have potatoes mealy, do not let them stop  boiling for an instant; and when they are done, turn the water off,  and let them steam for ten or twelve minutes over the fire. See they  don't stay long enough to burn to the kettle. In Canada, they cut  the skin all off, and put them in pans, to be cooked over a stove,  by steam. Those who have eaten them, say they are mealy and white,  looking like large snow-balls when brought upon the table.    Potatoes boiled and mashed while hot, are good to use in making short  cakes and puddings; they save flour, and less shortening is necessary.    It is said that a bit of unslacked lime, about as big as a robin's  egg, thrown among old, watery potatoes, while they are boiling, will  tend to make them mealy. I never saw the experiment tried.    Asparagus should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes; half an hour,  if old.    Green peas should be boiled from twenty minutes to sixty, according  to their age; string beans the same. Corn should be boiled from twenty  minutes to forty, according to age; dandelions half an hour, or three  quarters, according to age. Dandelions are very much improved by  cultivation. If cut off, without injuring the root, they will spring  up again, fresh and tender, till late in the season.    Beet-tops should be boiled twenty minutes; and spinage three or four  minutes. Put in no green vegetables till the water boils, if you would  keep all their sweetness.    When green peas have become old and yellow, they may be made tender  and green by sprinkling in a pinch or two of pearlash, while they  are boiling. Pearlash has the same effect upon all summer vegetables,  rendered tough by being too old. If your well-water is very hard, it  is always an advantage to use a little pearlash in cooking.    Tomatoes should be skinned by pouring boiling water over them. After  they are skinned, they should be stewed half an hour, in tin, with  a little salt, a small bit of butter, and a spoonful of water, to  keep them from burning. This is a delicious vegetable. It is easily  cultivated, and yields a most abundant crop. Some people pluck them  green, and pickle them.    The best sort of catsup is made from tomatoes. The vegetables  should be squeezed up in the hand, salt put to them, and set by  for twenty-four hours. After being passed through a sieve, cloves,  allspice, pepper, mace, garlic, and whole mustard-seed should be  added. It should be boiled down one third, and bottled after it is  cool. No liquid is necessary, as the tomatoes are very juicy. A good  deal of salt and spice is necessary to keep the catsup well. It is  delicious with roast meat; and a cupful adds much to the richness of  soup and chowder. The garlic should be taken out before it is bottled.    Celery should be kept in the cellar, the roots covered with tan, to  keep them moist.    Green squashes that are turning yellow, and striped squashes, are more  uniformly sweet and mealy than any other kind.    If the tops of lettuce be cut off when it is becoming too old for  use, it will grow up again fresh and tender, and may thus be kept good  through the summer.    It is a good plan to boil onions in milk and water; it diminishes the  strong taste of that vegetable. It is an excellent way of serving up  onions, to chop them after they are boiled, and put them in a stewpan,  with a little milk, butter, salt, and pepper, and let them stew about  fifteen minutes. This gives them a fine flavor, and they can be served  up very hot.           *       *       *       *       *          HERBS.      All herbs should be carefully kept from the air. Herb tea, to do any  good, should be made _very strong_.    Herbs should be gathered while in blossom. If left till they have  gone to seed, the strength goes into the seed. Those who have a little  patch of ground, will do well to raise the most important herbs; and  those who have not, will do well to get them in quantities from some  friend in the country; for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13499"],[0,"Two Little Savages (#7)"],[1,"with error and  superstition:    \"Hold Daddy Longlegs by one leg and say, 'tell me where the cows are,'  and he will point just right under another leg, and onct he told me  where to find my necklace when I lost it.    \"Shoot the Swallows and the cows give bloody milk.

She had so much of what he wanted to know that he had almost made up  his mind to tell her where he went each Saturday when he had finished  his work.    A week or two longer and she would have shared the great secret, but  something took place to end their comradeship.          XI    Lung Balm      One day as this girl went with him through a little grove on the edge  of the town, she stopped at a certain tree and said:    \"If that ain't Black-cherry!\"    \"You mean Choke-cherry.\"    \"No, Black-cherry. Choke-cherry ain't no good; but Black-cherry bark's  awful good for lung complaint. Grandma always keeps it. I've been  feeling a bit queer meself\" [she was really as strong as an ox].  \"Guess I'll git some.\" So she and Yan planned an expedition together.  The boldness of it scared the boy. The girl helped herself to a  hatchet in the tool box--the sacred tool box of his father.    Yan's mother saw her with it and demanded why she had it. With ready  effrontery she said it was to hammer in the hook that held the  clothesline, and proceeded to carry out the lie with a smiling face.  That gave Yan a new lesson and not a good one. The hatchet was at once  put back in the box, to be stolen more carefully later on.    Biddy announced that she was going to the grocery shop. She met Yan  around the corner and they made for the lot. Utterly regardless of  property rights, she showed Yan how to chip off the bark of the  Black-cherry. \"Don't chip off all around; that's bad luck--take it  on'y from the sunny side.\" She filled a basket with the pieces and  they returned home.    Here she filled a jar with bits of the inner layer, then, pouring  water over it, let it stand for a week. The water was then changed to  a dark brown stuff with a bitter taste and a sweet, aromatic smell.    \"It's terrible good,\" she said. \"Granny always keeps it handy. It  cures lots of people. Now there was Bud Ellis--the doctors just guv  him up. They said he didn't have a single lung left, and he come  around to Granny. He used to make fun of Granny; but now he wuz plumb  scairt. At first Granny chased him away; then when she seen that he  was awful sick, she got sorry and told him how to make Lung Balm. He  was to make two gallons each time and bring it to her. Then she took  and fixed it so it was one-half as much and give it back to him. Well,  in six months if he wasn't all right.\"    Biddy now complained nightly of \"feelin's\" in her chest. These  feelings could be controlled only by a glass or two of Lung Balm.  Her condition must have been critical, for one night after several  necessary doses of Balm her head seemed affected. She became  abusive to the lady of the house and at the end of the month a less  interesting help was in her place.    There were many lessons good and bad that Yan might have drawn from  this; but the only one that he took in was that the Black-cherry bark  is a wonderful remedy. The family doctor said that it really was so,  and Yan treasured up this as a new and precious fragment of woodcraft.    Having once identified the tree, he was surprised to see that it was  rather common, and was delighted to find it flourishing in his own  Glenyan.    This made him set down on paper all the trees he knew, and he was  surprised to find how few they were and how uncertain he was about  them.      Maple--hard and soft.    Beach.    Elm--swamp and slippery.    Ironwood.    Birch--white and black.    Ash--white and black.    Pine.    Cedar.    Balsam.    Hemlock and Cherry.    He had heard that the Indians knew the name and properties of every  tree and plant in the woods, and that was what he wished to be able to  say of himself.    One day by the bank of the river he noticed a pile of empty shells of  the fresh-water Mussel, or Clam. The shells were common enough, but  why all together and marked in the same way? Around the pile on the  mud were curious tracks and marks. There were so many that it was hard  to find a perfect one, but when he did, remembering the Coon track,  he drew a picture of it. It was too small to be the mark of his old  acquaintance. He did not find any one to tell him what it was, but one  day he saw a round, brown animal hunched up on the bank eating a clam.  It dived into the water at his approach, but it reappeared swimming  farther on. Then, when it dived again, Yan saw by its long thin  tail that it was a Muskrat, like the stuffed one he had seen in the  taxidermist's window.    He soon learned that the more he studied those tracks the more  different kinds he found. Many were rather mysterious, so he could  only draw them and put them aside, hoping some day for light. One  of the strangest and most puzzling turned out to be the trail of a  Snapper, and another proved to be merely the track of a Common Crow  that came to the water's edge to drink.    The curios that he gathered and stored in his shanty increased in  number and in interest. The place became more and more part of  himself. Its concealment bettered as the foliage grew around it again,  and he gloried in its wild seclusion and mystery, and wandered through  the woods with his bow and arrows, aiming harmless, deadly blows at  snickering Red-squirrels--though doubtless he would have been as sorry  as they had he really hit one.    Yan soon found out that he was not the only resident of the shanty.  One day as he sat inside wondering why he had not made a fireplace, so  that he could sit at an indoor fire, he saw a silent little creature  flit along between two logs in the back wall. He remained still. A  beautiful little Woodmouse, for such it was, soon came out in plain  view and sat up to look at Yan and wash its face. Yan reached out for  his bow and"]]]
