Dr. Richard Cabot  says that probably resistance is lowered as much by lack of sufficient  sleep as by any other factor, and that all you can soak into your system  in twenty-four hours is not too much. Don't forget the fresh air.    You generally suffer from sleeplessness, I believe. The overweights are  always advised not to sleep too much. They will find while reducing that  they won't want to sleep so much, anyway. They will like to stay  awake--they feel so much happier.    [Sidenote: _Sometimes_]    Now, when you retire and try to sleep but cannot, try this--it works  with me. You know when you are passing over your mental images become  distorted and grotesque. I artificially induce that state. If I find  myself rehearsing about two hundred times, with appropriate gestures,  the keen, witty, logical remarks which I could have made in favor of my  pet legislation in the club discussion, but didn't, then I begin after  this fashion:    Pink elephants with green ribbons on their tails--red rhinoceri (is that  right, or should it be rhinoceroses?)--smiling peanuts--Woman's City  Club--Social Health Insurance--why didn't I say--I wish I had  said--(here get out, you annoyance!)--pink elephants--and so forth and  so forth.    [Sidenote: _Picture of Pink Elephant Adorned_]    [Sidenote: _Woe Is Me_]    Now I realize I have ruined myself. I am my own worst enemy. I have  exposed my whole life before those modern vivisectionists, the army of  amateur psycho-analysts.    [Sidenote: _Exercise_]    Third: Exercise. Great muscular exertion should be avoided, but the  setting-up exercises that I advise, if begun with moderation and  increased gradually, will undoubtedly stimulate the appetite and help  the body functions to be better performed.    [Sidenote: _Food_]    Fourth: Since food is the only source of body substance, you must  gradually train your stomach so that it can care for enough food to not  only supply your bodily energy, but to leave a little excess to be  stored as fat.    [Sidenote: _Your Stomach_]    If you have a small appetite--and many of you have--your stomach is  undoubtedly contracted, and you must gradually add to the amount you  have been eating, even though it may cause some distress, until you have  disciplined it so that it can handle what you need without distress. The  stomach is a muscular organ and can be trained and exercised somewhat as  other organs can. You will not have much appetite at first, but it will  develop. Sometimes a short fast for a day or two, drinking nothing but  pure water, seems to be beneficial in the beginning.    Do not drink much with your meals, unless the drink has food value by  the addition of lots of cream or sugar, or both.    [Sidenote: _Eat More_]    Decide how many calories you need for your activities, gradually add to  your dietary until you have reached that number, and then some more, and  you will gain as surely as the overweight individual will lose by doing  the opposite. It may take a long time, or you may get results very  rapidly, depending somewhat upon the individual characteristics.  Gradually increase your butter, cream, sugar, chocolate, and so forth,  as they are very high in food value.    Study the Key to the Calories and reckon your calories every day for a  while. You have already noticed that the foods that you like are low in  food value.    Here are some of the things you can take to add to your fuel:    [Sidenote: _Try Some of These_]    A glass of milk, hot or cold, taken between meals and before retiring,  will add about 500 calories.    Cream sauce on your vegetables will add to their value.    Cod liver oil, or olive oil, or cream, begun in small doses and  gradually increased.    One malted milk, made with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream,  and the malted milk, will add about 500 calories.    [Sidenote: _Learned Phraseology_]    You remember the painful time that I spoke of when there was so much  more of me than there ought to be? Well, the aforesaid concoction, made  with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream, and the malted milk,  was accessory before the fact, and also particeps criminis before the  law.    I absorbed this phraseology by being president of the Professional  Woman's Club, with its high-class women attorneys, ministers, dentists,  Ph.D.'s, and \"Medical Trust\" doctors.    [Sidenote: _Explanatory Note 1_]    \"Medical Trust.\"--The American Medical Association (A.M.A.), a powerful  trust you can't get into unless you have a high preliminary education  and are a graduate of a high-class medical college. Eleven years'  training after the grammar school is their minimum standard now.    [Sidenote: _Explanatory Note 2_]    \"League for Medical Ignorance.\"--The so-called \"League for Medical  Freedom\"; the opponent of the above mentioned trust. Their standard--any  old kind of a medical or religious training, two weeks or longer,  engrafted on anyone who has the money to pay for the course. No  education, no barrier; in fact, those of limited education make the  loudest boosters for the league. In justice, I must say that many  splendid, estimable persons belong to this league, not knowing these  facts.    [Sidenote: _Thorough Mastication_]    Fifth: See page 92 in my advice to the fat. It is as important for you  as for them. (It always makes me mildly furious when I look up a word  and am directed to seek some other locality. If it affects you that  way--seek page 60 in my advice to you.)    Also have your teeth X-rayed. Blind abscesses at the roots will cause  all sorts of aches and pains, as well as underweight.    [Sidenote: _Especially About Your Ailments_]    [Sidenote: _Organ Recitals Wednesday Evenings Only_]    Sixth: _Don't talk so much_. See if you can't leave out two-thirds of  the totally unimportant, uninteresting details. A tremendous amount of  energy is used in talking. This habit I would not say was confined to  you, by any means; it is another one of those pretty nearly universal  errors.    I will not give you a sample fattening menu, for it might be all out of  proportion to what you could handle, and it would upset you. Make out  your own menus, realizing that you must work gradually to the desired  amount.    I am taking it for granted that you are organically sound, that your  scientific, educated physician has said there is nothing the matter with  you, except perhaps your \"nervous\" disposition.    Have I not been nice to you? All right, relax and watch yourself get  into the class of the plumptically adequate.    And if you don't succeed after a faithful trial, take the milk-cure,  with its three to six weeks' absolute rest.    _Recapitulation_         1. Calm yourself.       2. Sleep.       3. Exercise.       4. Food.       5. Masticate       6. Delete the details.       7. Milk-cure.    _Review_         1. Repeat Elbert Hubbard's advice.       2. Give three reasons why worry can make       you thin.       3. Define \"Medical Trust\" and \"League       for Medical Freedom.\"       4. Memorize paragraph about nature       5. Enumerate the things you can eat to       increase your calories.          7    Exercise      It is practically impossible to reduce weight through exercise alone,  unless one can do a tremendous amount of it. For the food that one eats  is usually enough to cover the energy lost by the exercise.    [Sidenote: _Light On Your Feet_]    However, exercise is a very important feature of any reducing program;  not because of the fat that is burned up in the exercise--and there is  some burned--but for the reason that it is necessary to keep one in a  healthy condition. The muscles, the internal organs, the bones, the  brain, are all benefited--in fact, the entire system.    [Sidenote: _Duty Dances_]    The exercises described hereinafter will help make you fat or thin, and  they will keep you supple, graceful, and light on your feet, so that  when I tell my husband that he must dance with you, Madam, he will not  say, \"Nothing stirring,\" and when you, Professor, ask me to dance, I  will not curse the day I was born.    [Sidenote: _Warning_]    If you have not been accustomed to exercise, I warn you to take up only  one or two at a time and do each one a few times only. You will be  atrociously sore, and you will realize that you have muscles of which  you wotted not.    However, persist, if you are sure there are no organic reasons why you  shouldn't--such as a weak heart. (In case you are very much overweight,  I think it advisable to wait until you have reduced somewhat.)    [Sidenote: _Or Classic Dancing_]    It is splendid if you can belong to a gymnasium or to a physical culture  class, but ten to fifteen minutes' systematic daily exercise practiced  with vim, and each set followed by deep breathing, will do more good  than a gymnasium spasmodically attended. Brisk walking with a long  stride isn't so bad; in fact, if taken with a very long stride it will  twist 'most every organ you have in your body.    There are hundreds of exercises you can take. If you will notice little  rascal's illustrations you will find many good ones. Those illustrating  the beginning of this chapter are excellent.    If possible, it is best to take the exercises on arising in the morning,  but if you have a household to care for you may not be able to do so.  For those who have to do their own work, it may be well to do the work  first. You can do it in half the time if you plan it carefully and speed  up. (This advice is not for my thin friends; their speedometers register  too high already.) It does not matter so much when the exercises are  done as that they are done, and done every day for the rest of your  life, with the possible exception of two or three days a month.    Gallstones, permanent stiff joints, and other little things like that  will have a hard time forming.    _My Exercises_    [Sidenote: _They Reach Most of My Muscles_]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15097"],[0,"A Grammar of the English Tongue (#7)"],[1,"      *       *       *       *       *    Of DERIVATION.        That the English language may be more easily understood, it is      necessary to inquire how its derivative words are deduced from their      primitives, and how the primitives are borrowed from other languages.      In this inquiry I shall sometimes copy Dr. Wallis, and sometimes      endeavour to supply his detects, and rectify his errours.    Nouns are derived from verbs.    The thing implied in the verb, as done or produced, is commonly either the  present of the verb; as to love, love; to fright, a fright; to fight, a  fight; or the preterit of the verb, as to strike, I strick or strook, a  stroke.    The action is the same with the participle present, as loving, frighting,  fighting, striking.    The agent, or person acting, is denoted by the syllable er added to the  verb, as lover, frighter, striker.    Substantives, adjectives, and sometimes other parts of speech, are changed  into verbs: in which case the vowel is often lengthened, or the consonant  softened; as, a house, to house; brass, to braze; glass, to glaze; grass,  to graze; price, to prize; breath, to breathe; a fish, to fish; oil, to  oil; further, to further; forward, to forward; hinder, to hinder.    Sometimes the termination en is added, especially to adjectives; as, haste,  to hasten; length, to lengthen; strength, to strengthen; short, to shorten;  fast, to fasten; white, to whiten; black, to blacken; hard, to harden;  soft, to soften.    From substantives are formed adjectives of plenty, by adding the  termination y: as a louse, lousy; wealth, wealthy; health, healthy; might,  mighty; worth, worthy; wit, witty; lust, lusty; water, watery, earth,  earthy; wood, (a wood) woody; air, airy; a heart, hearty; a hand, handy.    From substantives are formed adjectives of plenty, by adding the  termination ful, denoting abundance; as, joy, joyful; fruit, fruitful;  youth, youthful; care, careful; use, useful; delight, delightful; plenty,  plentiful; help, helpful.    Sometimes in almost the same sense, but with some kind of diminution  thereof, the termination some is added, denoting something, or in some  degree; as delight, delightsome; game, gamesome; irk, irksome; burden,  burdensome; trouble, troublesome; light, lightsome; hand, handsome; alone,  lonesome; toil, toilsome.    On the contrary, the termination less added to substantives, makes  adjectives signifying want; as, worthless, witless, heartless, joyless,  careless, helpless. Thus comfort, comfortless; sap, sapless.    Privation or contrariety is very often denoted by the participle un  prefixed to many adjectives, or in before words derived from the Latin; as  pleasant, unpleasant; wise, unwise; profitable, unprofitable, patient,  impatient. Thus unworthy, unhealthy, unfruitful, unuseful, and many more.        The original English privative is un; but as we often borrow trom the      Latin, or its descendants, words already signifying privation, as      inefficacious, impious, indiscreet, the inseparable particles un and in      have fallen into confusion, from which it is not easy to disentangle      them.        Un is prefixed to all words originally English, as untrue, untruth,      untaught, unhandsome.        Un is prefixed to all participles made privative adjectives, as      unfeeling, unassisting, unaided, undelighted, unendeared.        Un ought never to be prefixed to a participle present to mark a      forbearance of action, as unsighing, but a privation of habit, as      unpitying.        Un is prefixed to most substantives which have an English termination,      as unfertileness, unperfectness, which, if they have borrowed      terminations, take in or im, as infertility, imperfection; uncivil,      incivility; unactive, inactivity.        In borrowing adjectives, if we receive them already compounded, it is      usual to retain the particle prefixed, as indecent, inelegant,      improper; but if we borrow the adjective, and add the privative      particle, we commonly prefix un, as unpolite, ungallant.    The prepositive particles dis and mis, derived from the des and mes of the  French, signify almost the same as un; yet dis rather imports contrariety  than privation, since it answers to the Latin preposition de. Mis  insinuates some errour, and for the most part may be rendered by the Latin  words male or perperam. To like, to dislike; honour, dishonour; to honour,  to grace, to dishonour, to disgrace; to deign, to disdeign; chance, hap,  mischance, mishap; to take, to mistake; deed, misdeed; to use, to misuse;  to employ, to misemploy, to apply, to misapply.    Words derived from Latin written with de or dis retain the same  signification; as distinguish, distinguo; detract, detraho; defame, defamo;  detain, detineo.    The termination ly added to substantives, and sometimes to adjectives,  forms adjectives that import some kind of similitude or agreement, being  formed by contraction of lick or like. A giant, giantly, giantlike; earth,  earthly; heaven, heavenly; world, worldly; God, godly; good, goodly.    The same termination ly, added to adjectives, forms adverbs of like  signification; as, beautiful, beautifully; sweet, sweetly; that is, in a  beautiful manner; with some degree of sweetness.    The termination ish added to adjectives, imports diminution; and added to  substantives, imports similitude or tendency to a character; as green,  greenish; white, whitish; soft, softish; a thief, thievish; a wolf,  wolfish; a child, childish.    We have forms of diminutives in substantives, though not frequent; as a  hill, a hillock; a cock, a cockrel; a pike, a pickrel; this is a French  termination: a goose, a gosling; this is a German termination: a lamb, a  lambkin; a chick, a chicken; a man, a manikin; a pipe, a pipkin; and thus  Halkin, whence the patronymick, Hawkins; Wilkin, Thomkin, and others.        Yet still there is another form of diminution among the English, by      lessening the sound itself, especially of vowels, as there is a form of      augmenting them by enlarging or even lengthening it; and that sometimes      not so much by change of the letters, as of their pronunciation; as,      sup, sip, soop, sop, sippet, where, besides the extenuation of the      vowel, there is added the French termination et; top, tip; spit, spout;      babe, baby; booby, [Greek: Boupais]; great pronounced long, especially      if with a stronger sound, grea-t; little, pronounced long lee-tle;      ting, tang, tong, imports a succession of smaller and then greater      sounds; and so in jingle, jangle, tingle, tangle, and many other made      words.        Much however of this is arbitrary and fanciful, depending wholly on      oral utterance, and therefore scarcely worthy the notice of Wallis.    Of concrete adjectives are made abstract substantives, by adding the  termination ness; and a few in hood or head, noting character or qualities:  as white, whiteness; hard, hardness; great, greatness; skilful,  skilfulness, unskilfulness; godhead, manhood, maidenhead, widowhood,  knighthood, priesthood, likelihood, falsehood.    There are other abstracts, partly derived from adjectives, and partly from  verbs, which are formed by the addition of the termination th, a small  change being sometimes made; as long, length; strong, strength; broad,  breadth; wide, width, deep, depth; true, truth; warm, warmth; dear, dearth;  slow, slowth; merry, mirth; heal, health; well, weal, wealth; dry, drought;  young, youth; and so moon, month.    Like these are some words derived from verbs; die, death; till, tilth;  grow, growth; mow, later mowth, after mowth; commonly spoken and written  later math, after math; steal, stealth; bear, birth, rue, ruth; and  probably earth, from to ear or plow; fly, flight; weigh, weight; fray,  fright; draw, draught.        These should rather be written flighth, frighth, only that custom will      not suffer h to be twice repeated.        The same form retain faith, spight, wreathe, wrath, broth, froth,      breath, sooth, worth, light, wight, and the like, whose primitives are      either entirely obsolete, or seldom occur. Perhaps they are derived      from fey or foy, spry, wry, wreak, brew, mow, fry, bray, say, work.    Some ending in ship, imply an office, employment, or condition; as,  kingship, wardship, guardianship, partnership, stewardship, headship,  lordship.        Thus worship, that is, worthship; whence worshipful, and to worship.    Some few ending in dom, rick, wick, do especially denote dominion, at least  state or condition; as, kingdom, dukedom, earldom, princedom, popedom,  Christendom, freedom, wisdom, whoredom, bishoprick, bailiwick.    Ment and age are plainly French terminations and are of the same import  with us as among them, scarcely ever occurring, except in words derived  from the French, as commandment, usage.        There are in English often long trains of words allied by their meaning      and derivation; as, to beat, a bat, batoon, a battle, a beetle, a      battledore, to batter, batter, a kind of glutinous composition for      food, made by beating different bodies into one mass. All these are of      similar signification, and perhaps derived from the Latin batuo. Thus      take, touch, tickle, tack, tackle; all imply a local conjunction from      the Latin tango, tetigi, tactum.        From two are formed twain, twice, twenty, twelve, twins, twine, twist,      twirl, twig, twitch, twinge, between, betwixt, twilight, twibil.        The following remarks, extracted from Wallis, are ingenious but of more      subtlety than solidity, and such as perhaps might in every language be      enlarged without end.        Sn usually imply the nose, and what relates to it. From the Latin nasus      are derived the French nez and the English nose; and nesse, a      promontory, as projecting like a nose. But as if from the consonants ns      taken from nasus, and"]]]
