They wasted no more time talking, but raced after Farmer Brown's boy as  fast as they could go. One of them, who was faster than the others, ran  ahead and whispered in Grandfather Frog's ear that they were coming to  help him. But poor old Grandfather Frog couldn't be comforted. He  couldn't see what there was that the Merry Little Breezes could do. His  legs smarted where the string cut into the skin, and his head ached,  for you know he was hanging head down. No, Sir, Grandfather Frog  couldn't be comforted. He was in a terrible fix, and he couldn't see any  way out of it. He hadn't the least bit of hope left. And all the time  Farmer Brown's boy was trudging along, whistling merrily. You see, it  didn't occur to him to think how Grandfather Frog must be suffering and  how terribly frightened he must be. He wasn't cruel. No, indeed, Farmer  Brown's boy wasn't cruel. That is, he didn't mean to be cruel. He was  just thoughtless, like a great many other boys, and girls too.    So he went whistling on his way until he reached the Long Lane leading  from the Green Meadows up to Farmer Brown's dooryard. No sooner was he  in the Long Lane than something happened. A great cloud of dust and  leaves and tiny sticks was dashed in his face and nearly choked him.  Dirt got in his eyes. His hat was snatched from his head and went  sailing over into the garden. He dropped Grandfather Frog and felt for  his handkerchief to wipe the dirt from his eyes.    \"Phew!\" exclaimed Farmer Brown's boy, as he started after his hat. \"It's  funny where that wind came from so suddenly!\"    But you know and I know that it was the Merry Little Breezes working  together who made up that sudden wind. And Grandfather Frog ought to  have known it too, but he didn't. You see the dust had got in his nose  and eyes just as it had in those of Farmer Brown's boy, and he was so  frightened and confused that he couldn't think. So he lay just where  Farmer Brown's boy dropped him, and he didn't have any more hope than  before.          XVI    THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES WORK HARD      The Merry Little Breezes almost shouted aloud with delight when they saw  Farmer Brown's boy drop Grandfather Frog to feel for his handkerchief  and wipe out the dust which they had thrown in his eyes. Then he had to  climb the fence and chase his hat through the garden. They would let him  almost get his hands on it and then, just as he thought that he surely  had it, they would snatch it away. It was great fun for the Merry Little  Breezes. But they were not doing it for fun. No, indeed, they were not  doing it for fun! They were doing it to lead Farmer Brown's boy away  from Grandfather Frog.    Just as soon as they dared, they dropped the hat and then separated and  rushed away in all directions across the Green Meadows, over to the  Green Forest, and down to the Smiling Pool. What were they going for?  Why, to hunt for some of Grandfather Frog's friends and ask their help.  You see, the Merry Little Breezes could make Farmer Brown's boy drop  Grandfather Frog, but they couldn't untie a knot or cut a string, and  this is just what had got to be done to set Grandfather Frog free, for  his hind-legs were tied together. So now they were looking for some one  with sharp teeth, who thought enough of Grandfather Frog to come and  help him.    One thought of Striped Chipmunk and started for the old stone wall to  look for him. Another went in search of Danny Meadow Mouse. A third  headed for the dear Old Briar-patch after Peter Rabbit. A fourth  remembered Jimmy Skunk and how he had once set Blacky the Crow free from  a snare. A fifth remembered what sharp teeth Happy Jack Squirrel has and  hurried over to the Green Forest to look for him. A sixth started  straight for the Smiling Pool to tell Jerry Muskrat. And every one of  them raced as fast as he could.    All this time Grandfather Frog was without hope. Yes, Sir, poor old  Grandfather Frog was wholly in despair. You see, he didn't know what the  Merry Little Breezes were trying to do, and he was so frightened and  confused that he couldn't think. When Farmer Brown's boy dropped him, he  lay right where he fell for a few minutes. Then, right close at hand, he  saw an old board. Without really thinking, he tried to get to it, for  there looked as if there might be room for him to hide under it. It was  hard work, for you know his long hind-legs, which he uses for jumping,  were tied together. The best he could do was to crawl and wriggle and  pull himself along. Just as Farmer Brown's boy started to climb the  fence back into the Long Lane, his hat in his hand, Grandfather Frog  reached the old board and crawled under it.    Now when the Merry Little Breezes had thrown the dust in Farmer Brown's  boy's face and snatched his hat, he had dropped Grandfather Frog in such  a hurry that he didn't notice just where he did drop him, so now he  didn't know the exact place to look for him. But he knew pretty near,  and he hadn't the least doubt but that he would find him. He had just  started to look when the dinner horn sounded. Farmer Brown's boy  hesitated. He was hungry. If he was late, he might lose his dinner. He  could come back later to look for Grandfather Frog, for with his legs  tied Grandfather Frog couldn't get far. So, with a last look to make  sure of the place, Farmer Brown's boy started for the house.    If the Merry Little Breezes had known this, they would have felt ever so  much better. But they didn't. So they hurried as fast as ever they could  to find Grandfather Frog's friends and worked until they were almost too  tired to move, for it seemed as if every single one of Grandfather  Frog's friends had taken that particular day to go away from home. So  while Farmer Brown's boy ate his dinner, and Grandfather Frog lay hiding  under the old board in the Long Lane, the Merry Little Breezes did their  best to find help for him.          XVII    STRIPED CHIPMUNK CUTS THE STRING      \"Hippy hop! Flippy flop! All on a summer day    My mother turned me from the house and sent me out to play!\"      Striped Chipmunk knew perfectly well that that was just nonsense, but  Striped Chipmunk learned a long time ago that when you are just bubbling  right over with good feeling, there is fun in saying and doing foolish  things, and that is just how he was feeling. So he ran along the old  rail fence on one side of the Long Lane, saying foolish things and  cutting up foolish capers just because he felt so good, and all the time  seeing all that those bright little eyes of his could take in.    Now Striped Chipmunk and the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West  Wind are great friends, very great friends, indeed. Almost every morning  they have a grand frolic together. But this morning the Merry Little  Breezes hadn't come over to the old stone wall where Striped Chipmunk  makes his home. Anyway, they hadn't come at the usual time. Striped  Chipmunk had waited a little while and then, because he was feeling so  good, he had decided to take a run down the Long Lane to see if anything  new had happened there. That is how it happened that when one of the  Merry Little Breezes did go to look for him, and was terribly anxious to  ask him to come to the help of Grandfather Frog, he was nowhere to be  found.    But Striped Chipmunk didn't know anything about that. He scampered  along the top rails of the old fence, jumped up on top of a post, and  sat up to wash his face and hands, for Striped Chipmunk is very neat and  cannot bear to be the least bit dirty. He looked up and winked at Ol'  Mistah Buzzard, sailing round and round way, way up in the blue, blue  sky. He chased his own tail round and round until he nearly fell off of  the post. He made a wry face in the direction of Redtail the Hawk, whom  he could see sitting in the top of a tall tree way over on the Green  Meadows. He scolded Bowser the Hound, who happened to come trotting up  the Long Lane, and didn't stop scolding until Bowser was out of sight.  Then he kicked up his heels and whisked along the old fence again.    Half-way across a shaky old rail, he suddenly stopped. His bright eyes  had seen something that filled him with curiosity, quite as much  curiosity as Peter Rabbit would have had. It was a piece of string. Yes,  Sir, it was a piece of string. Now Striped Chipmunk often had found  pieces of string, so there was nothing particularly interesting in the  string itself. What did interest him and make him very curious was the  fact that this piece of string kept moving. Every few seconds it gave a  little jerk. Whoever heard of a piece of string moving all by itself?  Certainly Striped Chipmunk never had. He couldn't understand it.    For a few minutes he watched it from the top rail of the old fence. Then  he scurried down to the ground and, a few steps at a time, stopping to  watch sharply between each little run, he drew nearer and nearer to that  queer acting string. It gave him a funny feeling inside to see a string  acting like that, so he was very careful not to get too near. He looked  at it from one side, then ran around and looked at it from the other  side. At last he got where he could see that one end of the string was  under an old board, and then he began to understand. Of course there was  somebody hiding under that old board and jerking the string.    [Illustration: He seized the other end of the string and began to pull.  _Page 88._]    Striped Chipmunk sat down and scratched his head thoughtfully. Whoever  was pulling that string couldn't be very big, or they would never have  been able to crawl under that old board, therefore he needn't be afraid.  A gleam of mischief twinkled in Striped Chipmunk's eyes. He seized the  other end of the string and began to pull. Such a jerking and yanking as  began right away! But he held on and pulled harder. Then out from under  the old board appeared the queer webbed feet of Grandfather Frog "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#7)"],[1,"of years the  mild process of dissolution which others endure from a brief moment to a  few hours.  The highest Adept is, in fact, dead to, and absolutely  unconscious of, the World;  he is oblivious of its pleasures, careless  of its miseries, in so far as sentimentalism goes, for the stern sense  of Duty never leaves him blind to its very existence....    The process of the emission and attraction of atoms, which the occultist  controls, has been discussed at length in that article and in other  writings.  It is by these means that he gets rid gradually of all the  old gross particles of his body, substituting for them finer and more  ethereal ones, till at last the former sthula sarira is completely dead  and disintegrated, and he lives in a body entirely of his own creation,  suited to his work.  That body is essential to his purposes;  as the  Elixir of Life says:--    To do good, as in every thing else, a man most have time and materials  to Work with, and this is a necessary means to the acquirement of powers  by which infinitely more good can be done than without them.  When these  are once mastered, the opportunities to use them will arrive....    Giving the practical instructions for that purpose, the same paper  continues:--    The physical man must be rendered more ethereal and sensitive; the  mental man more penetrating and profound;  the moral man more  self-denying and philosophical.    Losing sight of the above important considerations, the following  passage is entirely misunderstood:--    And from this account too, it will be perceptible how foolish it is for  people to ask the Theosophist \"to procure for them communication with  the highest Adepts.\"  It is with the utmost difficulty that one or two  can be induced, even by the throes of a world, to injure their own  progress by meddling with mundane affairs.  The ordinary reader will  say:  \"This is not god-like. This is the acme of selfishness.\" ....But  let him realize that a very high Adept, undertaking to reform the world,  would necessarily have to once more submit to Incarnation.  And is the  result of all that have gone before in that line sufficiently  encouraging to prompt a renewal of the attempt?    Now, in condemning the above passage as inculcating selfishness,  superficial critics neglect many profound truths.  In the first place,  they forget the other extracts already quoted which impose self-denial  as a necessary condition of success, and which say that, with progress,  new senses and new powers are acquired with which infinitely more good  can be done than without them.  The more spiritual the Adept becomes the  less can he meddle with mundane gross affairs and the more he has to  confine himself to spiritual work.  It has been repeated, times out of  number, that the work on the spiritual plane is as superior to the work  on the intellectual plane as the latter is superior to that on the  physical plane.  The very high Adepts, therefore, do help humanity, but  only spiritually:  they are constitutionally incapable of meddling with  worldly affairs.  But this applies only to very high Adepts.  There are  various degrees of Adept-ship, and those of each degree work for  humanity on the planes to which they may have risen.  It is only the  chelas that can live in the world, until they rise to a certain degree.  And it is because the Adepts do care for the world that they make their  chelas live in and work for it, as many of those who study the subject  are aware.  Each cycle produces its own occultists capable of working  for the humanity of the time on all the different planes;  but when the  Adepts foresee that at a particular period humanity will he incapable of  producing occultists for work on particular planes, for such occasions  they do provide by either voluntarily giving up their further progress  and waiting until humanity reaches that period, or by refusing to enter  into Nirvana and submitting to re-incarnation so as to be ready for work  when the time comes.  And although the world may not be aware of the  fact, yet there are even now certain Adepts who have preferred to remain  in statu quo and refuse to take the higher degrees, for the benefit of  the future generations of humanity.  In short, as the Adepts work  harmoniously, since unity is the fundamental law of their being, they  have, as it were, made a division of labour, according to which each  works on the plane appropriate to himself for the spiritual elevation of  us all--and the process of longevity mentioned in the Elixir of Life is  only the means to the end which, far from being selfish, is the most  unselfish purpose for which a human being can labour.    (--H.P. Blavatsky)          Contemplation      A general misconception on this subject seems to prevail.  One confines  oneself for some time in a room, and passively gazes at one's nose, a  spot on the wall, or, perhaps, a crystal, under the impression that such  is the true form of contemplation enjoined by Raj Yoga.  Many fail to  realize that true occultism requires a physical, mental, moral and  spiritual development to run on parallel lines, and injure themselves,  physically and spiritually, by practice of what they falsely believe to  be Dhyan.  A few instances may be mentioned here with advantage, as a  warning to over-zealous students.    At Bareilly the writer met a member of the Theosophical Society from  Farrukhabad, who narrated his experiences and shed bitter tears of  repentance for his past follies--as he termed them.  It appears from his  account that fifteen or twenty years ago having read about contemplation  in the Bhagavad Gita, he undertook the practice of it, without a proper  comprehension of its esoteric meaning and carried it on for several  years.  At first he experienced a sense of pleasure, but simultaneously  he found he was gradually losing self-control;  until after a few years  he discovered, to his great bewilderment and sorrow, that he was no  longer his own master.  He felt his heart actually growing heavy, as  though a load had been placed on it.  He had no control over his  sensations the communication between the brain and the heart had become  as though interrupted.  As matters grew worse, in disgust he  discontinued his \"contemplation.\"  This happened as long as seven years  ago;  and, although since then he has not felt worse, yet he could never  regain his original healthy state of mind and body.    Another case came under the writer's observation at Jubbulpore. The  gentleman concerned, after reading Patanjali and such other works, began  to sit for \"contemplation.\"  After a short time he commenced seeing  abnormal sights and hearing musical bells, but neither over these  phenomena nor over his own sensations could he exercise any control.  He  could not produce these results at will, nor could he stop them when  they were occurring.  Numerous such examples may be cited.  While  penning these lines, the writer has on his table two letters upon this  subject, one from Moradabad and the other from Trichinopoly.  In short,  all this mischief is due to a misunderstanding of the significance of  contemplation as enjoined upon students by all the schools of Occult  Philosophy.  With a view to afford a glimpse of the Reality through the  dense veil that enshrouds the mysteries of this Science of Sciences, an  article, the Elixir of Life, was written.  Unfortunately, in too many  instances, the seed seems to have fallen upon barren ground.  Some of  its readers pin their faith to the following clause in that paper:--  Reasoning from the known to the unknown meditation must be practiced and  encouraged.    But, alas! their preconceptions have prevented them from comprehending  what is meant by meditation.  They forget that the meditation spoken of  \"is the inexpressible yearning of the inner Man to 'go out towards the  infinite,' which in the olden time was the real meaning of adoration\"--  as the next sentence shows.  A good deal of light would be thrown upon  this subject if the reader were to turn to an earlier part of the same  paper, and peruse attentively the following paragraphs:--    So, then, we have arrived at the point where we have determined--  literally, not metaphorically--to crack the outer shell known as the  mortal coil or body, and hatch out of it, clothed in our next.  This  'next' is not a spiritual, but only a more ethereal form.  Having by a  long training and preparation adapted it for a life in the atmosphere,  during which time we have gradually made the outward shell to die off  through a certain process .... we have to prepare for this physiological  transformation.    How are we to do it?  In the first place we have the actual, visible,  material body--Man, so called, though, in fact, but his outer shell--to  deal with.  Let us bear in mind that Science teaches us that in about  every seven years we change skin as effectually as any serpent;  and  this so gradually and imperceptibly that, had not science after years of  unremitting study and observation assured us of it, no one would have  had the slightest suspicion of the fact.... Hence, if a man, partially  flayed alive, may sometimes survive and be covered with a new skin, so  our astral, vital body .... may be made to harden its particles to the  atmospheric changes.  The whole secret is to succeed in evolving it out,  and separating it from the visible; and while its generally invisible  atoms proceed to concrete themselves into a compact mass, to gradually  get rid of the old particles of our visible frame so as to make them die  and disappear before the new set has had time to evolve and replace  them.... We can say no more.    A correct comprehension of the above scientific process will give a clue  to the esoteric meaning of meditation or contemplation.  Science teaches  us that man changes his physical body continually, and this change is so  gradual that it is"]]]
