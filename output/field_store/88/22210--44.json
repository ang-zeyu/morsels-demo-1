[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1563"],[0,"The Crystal Stopper (#7)"],[1," Lupin found the window of his room shut.  By opening the communicating door? Impossible: Lupin found it locked and  barred with its two inner bolts.    Nevertheless, a person cannot pass through a wall by a mere operation of  will. To go in or out of a room requires a passage; and, as the act was  accomplished in the space of a few minutes, it was necessary, in the  circumstances, that the passage should be previously in existence, that  it should already have been contrived in the wall and, of course, known  to the woman. This hypothesis simplified the search by concentrating  it upon the door; for the wall was quite bare, without a cupboard,  chimney-piece or hangings of any kind, and unable to conceal the least  outlet.    Lupin went back to the drawing-room and prepared to make a study of the  door. But he at once gave a start. He perceived, at the first glance,  that the left lower panel of the six small panels contained within the  cross-bars of the door no longer occupied its normal position and that  the light did not fall straight upon it. On leaning forward, he saw two  little tin tacks sticking out on either side and holding the panel in  place, similar to a wooden board behind a picture-frame. He had only to  shift these. The panel at once came out.    Achille gave a cry of amazement. But Lupin objected:    \"Well? And what then? We are no better off than before. Here is an empty  oblong, eight or nine inches wide by sixteen inches high. You're not  going to pretend that a woman can slip through an opening which would  not admit the thinnest child of ten years old!\"    \"No, but she can have put her arm through and drawn the bolts.\"    \"The bottom bolt, yes,\" said Lupin. \"But the top bolt, no: the distance  is far too great. Try for yourself and see.\"    Achille tried and had to give up the attempt.    Lupin did not reply. He stood thinking for a long time. Then, suddenly,  he said:    \"Give me my hat... my coat...\"    He hurried off, urged by an imperative idea. And, the moment he reached  the street, he sprang into a taxi:    \"Rue Matignon, quick!...\"    As soon as they came to the house where he had been robbed of the  crystal stopper, he jumped out of the cab, opened his private entrance,  went upstairs, ran to the drawing-room, turned on the light and crouched  at the foot of the door leading to his bedroom.    He had guessed right. One of the little panels was loosened in the same  manner.    And, just as in his other flat in the Rue Chateaubriand, the opening was  large enough to admit a man's arm and shoulder, but not to allow him to  draw the upper bolt.    \"Hang!\" he shouted, unable any longer to master the rage that had been  seething within him for the last two hours. \"Blast! Shall I never have  finished with this confounded business?\"    In fact, an incredible ill-luck seemed to dog his footsteps, compelling  him to grope about at random, without permitting him to use the elements  of success which his own persistency or the very force of things placed  within his grasp. Gilbert gave him the crystal stopper. Gilbert sent him  a letter. And both had disappeared at that very moment.    And it was not, as he had until then believed, a series of fortuitous  and independent circumstances. No, it was manifestly the effect of an  adverse will pursuing a definite object with prodigious ability and  incredible boldness, attacking him, Lupin, in the recesses of his safest  retreats and baffling him with blows so severe and so unexpected that he  did not even know against whom he had to defend himself. Never, in the  course of his adventures, had he encountered such obstacles as now.    And, little by little, deep down within himself, there grew a haunting  dread of the future. A date loomed before his eyes, the terrible date  which he unconsciously assigned to the law to perform its work of  vengeance, the date upon which, in the light of a wan April morning, two  men would mount the scaffold, two men who had stood by him, two comrades  whom he had been unable to save from paying the awful penalty...        CHAPTER III. THE HOME LIFE OF ALEXIS DAUBRECQ    When Daubrecq the deputy came in from lunch on the day after the police  had searched his house he was stopped by Clemence, his portress, who  told him that she had found a cook who could be thoroughly relied on.    The cook arrived a few minutes later and produced first-rate characters,  signed by people with whom it was easy to take up her references. She  was a very active woman, although of a certain age, and agreed to do the  work of the house by herself, without the help of a man-servant, this  being a condition upon which Daubrecq insisted.    Her last place was with a member of the Chamber of Deputies, Comte  Saulevat, to whom Daubrecq at once telephoned. The count's steward gave  her a perfect character, and she was engaged.    As soon as she had fetched her trunk, she set to work and cleaned and  scrubbed until it was time to cook the dinner.    Daubrecq dined and went out.    At eleven o'clock, after the portress had gone to bed, the cook  cautiously opened the garden-gate. A man came up.    \"Is that you?\" she asked.    \"Yes, it's I, Lupin.\"    She took him to her bedroom on the third floor, overlooking the garden,  and at once burst into lamentations:    \"More of your tricks and nothing but tricks! Why can't you leave me  alone, instead of sending me to do your dirty work?\"    \"How can I help it, you dear old Victoire? [*] When I want a person of  respectable appearance and incorruptible morals, I think of you. You  ought to be flattered.\"           * See The Hollow Needle by Maurice Leblanc, translated by       Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, and later volumes of the Lupin       series.    \"That's all you care about me!\" she cried. \"You run me into danger once  more; and you think it's funny!\"    \"What are you risking?\"    \"How do you mean, what am I risking? All my characters are false.\"    \"Characters are always false.\"    \"And suppose M. Daubrecq finds out? Suppose he makes inquiries?\"    \"He has made inquiries.\"    \"Eh? What's that?\"    \"He has telephoned to the steward of Comte Saulevat, in whose service  you say that you have had the honour of being.\"    \"There, you see, I'm done for!\"    \"The count's steward could not say enough in your praise.\"    \"He does not know me.\"    \"But I know him. I got him his situation with Comte Saulevat. So you  understand...\"    Victoire seemed to calm down a little:    \"Well,\" she said, \"God's will be done... or rather yours. And what do  you expect me to do in all this?\"    \"First, to put me up. You were my wet-nurse once. You can very well give  me half your room now. I'll sleep in the armchair.\"    \"And next?\"    \"Next? To supply me with such food as I want.\"    \"And next?\"    \"Next? To undertake, with me and under my direction, a regular series of  searches with a view...\"    \"To what?\"    \"To discovering the precious object of which I spoke to you.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"A crystal stopper.\"    \"A crystal stopper... Saints above! A nice business! And, if we don't  find your confounded stopper, what then?\"    Lupin took her gently by the arm and, in a serious voice:    \"If we don't find it, Gilbert, young Gilbert whom you know and love,  will stand every chance of losing his head; and so will Vaucheray.\"    \"Vaucheray I don't mind... a dirty rascal like him! But Gilbert...\"    \"Have you seen the papers this evening? Things are looking worse than  ever. Vaucheray, as might be expected, accuses Gilbert of stabbing the  valet; and it so happens that the knife which Vaucheray used belonged  to Gilbert. That came out this morning. Whereupon Gilbert, who is  intelligent in his way, but easily frightened, blithered and launched  forth into stories and lies which will end in his undoing. That's how  the matter stands. Will you help me?\"    Thenceforth, for several days, Lupin moulded his existence upon  Daubrecq's, beginning his investigations the moment the deputy left the  house. He pursued them methodically, dividing each room into sections  which he did not abandon until he had been through the tiniest nooks and  corners and, so to speak, exhausted every possible device.    Victoire searched also. And nothing was forgotten. Table-legs,  chair-rungs, floor-boards, mouldings, mirror- and picture-frames,  clocks, plinths, curtain-borders, telephone-holders and electric  fittings: everything that an ingenious imagination could have selected  as a hiding-place was overhauled.    And they also watched the deputy's least actions, his most unconscious  movements, the expression of his face, the books which he read and the  letters which he wrote.    It was easy enough. He seemed to live his life in the light of day. No  door was ever shut. He received no visits. And his existence worked with  mechanical regularity. He went to the Chamber in the afternoon, to the  club in the evening.    \"Still,\" said Lupin, \"there must be something that's not orthodox behind  all this.\"    \"There's nothing of the sort,\" moaned Victoire. \"You're wasting your  time and we shall be bowled out.\"    The presence of the detectives and their habit of walking up and down  outside the windows drove her mad. She refused to admit that they were  there for any other purpose than to trap her, Victoire. And, each time  that she went shopping, she was quite surprised that one of those men  did not lay his hand upon her shoulder.    One day she returned all upset. Her basket of provisions was shaking on  her arm.    \"What's the matter, my dear Victoire?\" said Lupin. \"You're looking  green.\"    \"Green? I dare say I do. So would you look green...\"    She had to sit down and it was only after making repeated efforts that  she succeeded in stuttering:    \"A man... a man spoke to me... at the fruiterer's.\"    \"By jingo! Did he want you to run away with him?\"    \"No, he gave me a letter...\"    \"Then what are you complaining about? It was a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#7)"],[1,"with delight.  But who is Ione?'    'Ah! you have but just come to Pompeii, or you would deserve ostracism  for your ignorance,' said Lepidus, conceitedly; 'not to know Ione, is  not to know the chief charm of our city.'    'She is of the most rare beauty,' said Pansa; 'and what a voice!'    'She can feed only on nightingales' tongues,' said Clodius.    'Nightingales' tongues!--beautiful thought!' sighed the umbra.    'Enlighten me, I beseech you,' said Glaucus.    'Know then...' began Lepidus.    'Let me speak,' cried Clodius; 'you drawl out your words as if you spoke  tortoises.'    'And you speak stones,' muttered the coxcomb to himself, as he fell back  disdainfully on his couch.    'Know then, my Glaucus,' said Clodius, 'that Ione is a stranger who has  but lately come to Pompeii.  She sings like Sappho, and her songs are  her own composing; and as for the tibia, and the cithara, and the lyre,  I know not in which she most outdoes the Muses.  Her beauty is most  dazzling.  Her house is perfect; such taste--such gems--such bronzes!  She is rich, and generous as she is rich.'    'Her lovers, of course,' said Glaucus, 'take care that she does not  starve; and money lightly won is always lavishly spent.'    'Her lovers--ah, there is the enigma!--Ione has but one vice--she is  chaste. She has all Pompeii at her feet, and she has no lovers: she will  not even marry.'    'No lovers!' echoed Glaucus.    'No; she has the soul of Vestal with the girdle of Venus.'    'What refined expressions!' said the umbra.    'A miracle!' cried Glaucus.  'Can we not see her?'    'I will take you there this evening, said Clodius; 'meanwhile...' added  he, once more rattling the dice.    'I am yours!' said the complaisant Glaucus.  'Pansa, turn your face!'    Lepidus and Sallust played at odd and even, and the umbra looked on,  while Glaucus and Clodius became gradually absorbed in the chances of  the dice.    'By Pollux!' cried Glaucus, 'this is the second time I have thrown the  caniculae' (the lowest throw).    'Now Venus befriend me!' said Clodius, rattling the box for several  moments. 'O Alma Venus--it is Venus herself!' as he threw the highest  cast, named from that goddess--whom he who wins money, indeed, usually  propitiates!    'Venus is ungrateful to me,' said Glaucus, gaily; 'I have always  sacrificed on her altar.'    'He who plays with Clodius,' whispered Lepidus, 'will soon, like  Plautus's Curculio, put his pallium for the stakes.'    'Poor Glaucus!--he is as blind as Fortune herself,' replied Sallust, in  the same tone.    'I will play no more,' said Glaucus; 'I have lost thirty sestertia.'    'I am sorry...' began Clodius.    'Amiable man!' groaned the umbra.    'Not at all!' exclaimed Glaucus; 'the pleasure I take in your gain  compensates the pain of my loss.'    The conversation now grew general and animated; the wine circulated more  freely; and Ione once more became the subject of eulogy to the guests of  Glaucus.    'Instead of outwatching the stars, let us visit one at whose beauty the  stars grow pale,' said Lepidus.    Clodius, who saw no chance of renewing the dice, seconded the proposal;  and Glaucus, though he civilly pressed his guests to continue the  banquet, could not but let them see that his curiosity had been excited  by the praises of Ione: they therefore resolved to adjourn (all, at  least, but Pansa and the umbra) to the house of the fair Greek.  They  drank, therefore, to the health of Glaucus and of Titus--they performed  their last libation--they resumed their slippers--they descended the  stairs--passed the illumined atrium--and walking unbitten over the  fierce dog painted on the threshold, found themselves beneath the light  of the moon just risen, in the lively and still crowded streets of  Pompeii.    They passed the jewellers' quarter, sparkling with lights, caught and  reflected by the gems displayed in the shops, and arrived at last at the  door of Ione.  The vestibule blazed with rows of lamps; curtains of  embroidered purple hung on either aperture of the tablinum, whose walls  and mosaic pavement glowed with the richest colors of the artist; and  under the portico which surrounded the odorous viridarium they found  Ione, already surrounded by adoring and applauding guests!    'Did you say she was Athenian?' whispered Glaucus, ere he passed into  the peristyle.    'No, she is from Neapolis.'    'Neapolis!' echoed Glaucus; and at that moment the group, dividing on  either side of Ione, gave to his view that bright, that nymph-like  beauty, which for months had shone down upon the waters of his memory.        Chapter IV    THE TEMPLE OF ISIS.  ITS PRIEST.  THE CHARACTER OF ARBACES DEVELOPS  ITSELF.    THE story returns to the Egyptian.  We left Arbaces upon the shores of  the noonday sea, after he had parted from Glaucus and his companion.  As  he approached to the more crowded part of the bay, he paused and gazed  upon that animated scene with folded arms, and a bitter smile upon his  dark features.    'Gulls, dupes, fools, that ye are!' muttered he to himself; 'whether  business or pleasure, trade or religion, be your pursuit, you are  equally cheated by the passions that ye should rule!  How I could loathe  you, if I did not hate--yes, hate!  Greek or Roman, it is from us, from  the dark lore of Egypt, that ye have stolen the fire that gives you  souls.  Your knowledge--your poesy--your laws--your arts--your barbarous  mastery of war (all how tame and mutilated, when compared with the vast  original!)--ye have filched, as a slave filches the fragments of the  feast, from us!  And now, ye mimics of a mimic!--Romans, forsooth! the  mushroom herd of robbers! ye are our masters! the pyramids look down no  more on the race of Rameses--the eagle cowers over the serpent of the  Nile.  Our masters--no, not mine.  My soul, by the power of its wisdom,  controls and chains you, though the fetters are unseen.  So long as  craft can master force, so long as religion has a cave from which  oracles can dupe mankind, the wise hold an empire over earth.  Even from  your vices Arbaces distills his pleasures--pleasures unprofaned by  vulgar eyes--pleasures vast, wealthy, inexhaustible, of which your  enervate minds, in their unimaginative sensuality, cannot conceive or  dream!  Plod on, plod on, fools of ambition and of avarice! your petty  thirst for fasces and quaestorships, and all the mummery of servile  power, provokes my laughter and my scorn.  My power can extend wherever  man believes.  I ride over the souls that the purple veils.  Thebes may  fall, Egypt be a name; the world itself furnishes the subjects of  Arbaces.'    Thus saying, the Egyptian moved slowly on; and, entering the town, his  tall figure towered above the crowded throng of the forum, and swept  towards the small but graceful temple consecrated to Isis.    That edifice was then but of recent erection; the ancient temple had  been thrown down in the earthquake sixteen years before, and the new  building had become as much in vogue with the versatile Pompeians as a  new church or a new preacher may be with us.  The oracles of the goddess  at Pompeii were indeed remarkable, not more for the mysterious language  in which they were clothed, than for the credit which was attached to  their mandates and predictions.  If they were not dictated by a  divinity, they were framed at least by a profound knowledge of mankind;  they applied themselves exactly to the circumstances of individuals, and  made a notable contrast to the vague and loose generalities of their  rival temples.  As Arbaces now arrived at the rails which separated the  profane from the sacred place, a crowd, composed of all classes, but  especially of the commercial, collected, breathless and reverential,  before the many altars which rose in the open court.  In the walls of  the cella, elevated on seven steps of Parian marble, various statues  stood in niches, and those walls were ornamented with the pomegranate  consecrated to Isis.  An oblong pedestal occupied the interior building,  on which stood two statues, one of Isis, and its companion represented  the silent and mystic Orus.  But the building contained many other  deities to grace the court of the Egyptian deity: her kindred and  many-titled Bacchus, and the Cyprian Venus, a Grecian disguise for  herself, rising from her bath, and the dog-headed Anubis, and the ox  Apis, and various Egyptian idols of uncouth form and unknown  appellations.    But we must not suppose that among the cities of Magna Graecia, Isis was  worshipped with those forms and ceremonies which were of right her own.  The mongrel and modern nations of the South, with a mingled arrogance  and ignorance, confounded the worships of all climes and ages.  And the  profound mysteries of the Nile were degraded by a hundred meretricious  and frivolous admixtures from the creeds of Cephisus and of Tibur.  The  temple of Isis in Pompeii was served by Roman and Greek priests,  ignorant alike of the language and the customs of her ancient votaries;  and the descendant of the dread Egyptian kings, beneath the appearance  of reverential awe, secretly laughed to scorn the puny mummeries which  imitated the solemn and typical worship of his burning clime.    Ranged now on either side the steps was the sacrificial crowd, arrayed  in white garments, while at the summit stood two of the inferior  priests, the one holding a palm branch, the other a slender sheaf of  corn.  In the narrow passage in front thronged the bystanders.    'And what,' whispered Arbaces to one of the bystanders, who was a  merchant engaged in the Alexandrian trade, which trade had probably  first introduced in Pompeii the worship of the Egyptian goddess--'what  occasion now assembles you before the altars of the venerable Isis?  It  seems, by the white robes of the group before me, that a sacrifice is to  be rendered; and by the assembly of the priests, that ye are prepared  "]]]
