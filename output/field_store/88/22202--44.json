To the round of  ideas of the same dream, however, there belongs the recollection of my  first visit to Munich, when the _Propyloea_ struck me. The attendant  circumstances of the analysis render it admissible that the influence of  this second group of conceptions caused the displacement of amyl to  propyl. _Propyl_ is, so to say, the mean idea between _amyl_ and  _propyloea_; it got into the dream as a kind of _compromise_ by  simultaneous condensation and displacement.    The need of discovering some motive for this bewildering work of the  dream is even more called for in the case of displacement than in  condensation.    Although the work of displacement must be held mainly responsible if the  dream thoughts are not refound or recognized in the dream content  (unless the motive of the changes be guessed), it is another and milder  kind of transformation which will be considered with the dream thoughts  which leads to the discovery of a new but readily understood act of the  dream work. The first dream thoughts which are unravelled by analysis  frequently strike one by their unusual wording. They do not appear to be  expressed in the sober form which our thinking prefers; rather are they  expressed symbolically by allegories and metaphors like the figurative  language of the poets. It is not difficult to find the motives for this  degree of constraint in the expression of dream ideas. The dream content  consists chiefly of visual scenes; hence the dream ideas must, in the  first place, be prepared to make use of these forms of presentation.  Conceive that a political leader's or a barrister's address had to be  transposed into pantomime, and it will be easy to understand the  transformations to which the dream work is constrained by regard for  this _dramatization of the dream content_.    Around the psychical stuff of dream thoughts there are ever found  reminiscences of impressions, not infrequently of early  childhood--scenes which, as a rule, have been visually grasped. Whenever  possible, this portion of the dream ideas exercises a definite influence  upon the modelling of the dream content; it works like a center of  crystallization, by attracting and rearranging the stuff of the dream  thoughts. The scene of the dream is not infrequently nothing but a  modified repetition, complicated by interpolations of events that have  left such an impression; the dream but very seldom reproduces accurate  and unmixed reproductions of real scenes.    The dream content does not, however, consist exclusively of scenes, but  it also includes scattered fragments of visual images, conversations,  and even bits of unchanged thoughts. It will be perhaps to the point if  we instance in the briefest way the means of dramatization which are at  the disposal of the dream work for the repetition of the dream thoughts  in the peculiar language of the dream.    The dream thoughts which we learn from the analysis exhibit themselves  as a psychical complex of the most complicated superstructure. Their  parts stand in the most diverse relationship to each other; they form  backgrounds and foregrounds, stipulations, digressions, illustrations,  demonstrations, and protestations. It may be said to be almost the rule  that one train of thought is followed by its contradictory. No feature  known to our reason whilst awake is absent. If a dream is to grow out of  all this, the psychical matter is submitted to a pressure which  condenses it extremely, to an inner shrinking and displacement, creating  at the same time fresh surfaces, to a selective interweaving among the  constituents best adapted for the construction of these scenes. Having  regard to the origin of this stuff, the term _regression_ can be fairly  applied to this process. The logical chains which hitherto held the  psychical stuff together become lost in this transformation to the dream  content. The dream work takes on, as it were, only the essential content  of the dream thoughts for elaboration. It is left to analysis to restore  the connection which the dream work has destroyed.    The dream's means of expression must therefore be regarded as meager in  comparison with those of our imagination, though the dream does not  renounce all claims to the restitution of logical relation to the dream  thoughts. It rather succeeds with tolerable frequency in replacing these  by formal characters of its own.    By reason of the undoubted connection existing between all the parts of  dream thoughts, the dream is able to embody this matter into a single  scene. It upholds a _logical connection_ as _approximation in time and  space_, just as the painter, who groups all the poets for his picture of  Parnassus who, though they have never been all together on a mountain  peak, yet form ideally a community. The dream continues this method of  presentation in individual dreams, and often when it displays two  elements close together in the dream content it warrants some special  inner connection between what they represent in the dream thoughts. It  should be, moreover, observed that all the dreams of one night prove on  analysis to originate from the same sphere of thought.    The causal connection between two ideas is either left without  presentation, or replaced by two different long portions of dreams one  after the other. This presentation is frequently a reversed one, the  beginning of the dream being the deduction, and its end the hypothesis.  The direct _transformation_ of one thing into another in the dream seems  to serve the relationship of _cause_ and _effect_.    The dream never utters the _alternative \"either-or,\"_ but accepts both  as having equal rights in the same connection. When \"either-or\" is used  in the reproduction of dreams, it is, as I have already mentioned, to be  replaced by \"_and_.\"    Conceptions which stand in opposition to one another are preferably  expressed in dreams by the same element.[2] There seems no \"not\" in  dreams. Opposition between two ideas, the relation of conversion, is  represented in dreams in a very remarkable way. It is expressed by the  reversal of another part of the dream content just as if by way of  appendix. We shall later on deal with another form of expressing  disagreement. The common dream sensation of _movement checked_ serves  the purpose of representing disagreement of impulses--a _conflict of the  will_.    Only one of the logical relationships--that of _similarity, identity,  agreement_--is found highly developed in the mechanism of dream  formation. Dream work makes use of these cases as a starting-point for  condensation, drawing together everything which shows such agreement to  a _fresh unity_.    These short, crude observations naturally do not suffice as an estimate  of the abundance of the dream's formal means of presenting the logical  relationships of the dream thoughts. In this respect, individual dreams  are worked up more nicely or more carelessly, our text will have been  followed more or less closely, auxiliaries of the dream work will have  been taken more or less into consideration. In the latter case they  appear obscure, intricate, incoherent. When the dream appears openly  absurd, when it contains an obvious paradox in its content, it is so of  purpose. Through its apparent disregard of all logical claims, it  expresses a part of the intellectual content of the dream ideas.  Absurdity in the dream denotes _disagreement, scorn, disdain_ in the  dream thoughts. As this explanation is in entire disagreement with the  view that the dream owes its origin to dissociated, uncritical cerebral  activity, I will emphasize my view by an example:    _\"One of my acquaintances, Mr. M----, has been attacked by no less a  person than Goethe in an essay with, we all maintain, unwarrantable  violence. Mr. M---- has naturally been ruined by this attack. He  complains very bitterly of this at a dinner-party, but his respect for  Goethe has not diminished through this personal experience. I now  attempt to clear up the chronological relations which strike me as  improbable. Goethe died in 1832. As his attack upon Mr. M---- must, of  course, have taken place before, Mr. M---- must have been then a very  young man. It seems to me plausible that he was eighteen. I am not  certain, however, what year we are actually in, and the whole  calculation falls into obscurity. The attack was, moreover, contained  in Goethe's well-known essay on 'Nature.'\"_    The absurdity of the dream becomes the more glaring when I state that  Mr. M---- is a young business man without any poetical or literary  interests. My analysis of the dream will show what method there is in  this madness. The dream has derived its material from three sources:    1. Mr. M----, to whom I was introduced at a dinner-party, begged me one  day to examine his elder brother, who showed signs of mental trouble. In  conversation with the patient, an unpleasant episode occurred. Without  the slightest occasion he disclosed one of his brother's _youthful  escapades_. I had asked the patient the _year of his birth_ (_year of  death_ in dream), and led him to various calculations which might show  up his want of memory.    2. A medical journal which displayed my name among others on the cover  had published a _ruinous_ review of a book by my friend F---- of Berlin,  from the pen of a very _juvenile_ reviewer. I communicated with the  editor, who, indeed, expressed his regret, but would not promise any  redress. Thereupon I broke off my connection with the paper; in my  letter of resignation I expressed the hope that our _personal relations  would not suffer from this_. Here is the real source of the dream. The  derogatory reception of my friend's work had made a deep impression upon  me. In my judgment, it contained a fundamental biological discovery  which only now, several years "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#7)"],[1,"es,  foes who never grow tired of warring against us. These, our enemies,  are many: Our own flesh, the world, the Law, sin, death, the wrath and  judgment of God, and the devil himself.    The arguments which the false apostles advanced impress people to this  day. \"Who are you to dissent from the fathers and the entire Church, and  to bring a contradictory doctrine? Are you wiser than so many holy men,  wiser than the whole Church?\" When Satan, abetted by our own reason,  advances these arguments against us, we lose heart, unless we keep  on saying to ourselves: \"I don't care if Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine,  Peter, Paul, John, or an angel from heaven, teaches so and so. I know  that I teach the truth of God in Christ Jesus.\"    When I first took over the defense of the Gospel, I remembered what  Doctor Staupitz said to me. \"I like it well,\" he said, \"that the  doctrine which you proclaim gives glory to God alone and none to man.  For never can too much glory, goodness, and mercy be ascribed unto God.\"  These words of the worthy Doctor comforted and confirmed me. The Gospel  is true because it deprives men of all glory, wisdom, and righteousness  and turns over all honor to the Creator alone. It is safer to attribute  too much glory unto God than unto man.    You may argue that the Church and the fathers are holy. Yet the Church  is compelled to pray: \"Forgive us our trespasses,\" I am not to be  believed, nor is the Church to be believed, or the fathers, or the  apostles, or an angel from heaven, if they teach anything contrary to  the Word of God. Let the Word of God abide forever.    Peter erred in life and in doctrine. Paul might have dismissed Peter's  error as a matter of no consequence. But Paul saw that Peter's error  would lead to the damage of the whole Church unless it were corrected.  Therefore he withstood Peter to his face. The Church, Peter, the  apostles, angels from heaven, are not to be heard unless they teach the  genuine Word of God.    This argument is not always to our advantage. People ask: \"Whom then  shall we believe?\" Our opponents maintain that they teach the pure Word  of God. We do not believe them. They in turn hate and persecute us for  vile heretics. What can we do about it? With Paul we glory in the Gospel  of Jesus Christ. What do we gain? We are told that our glorying is idle  vanity and unadulterated blasphemy. The moment we abase ourselves and  give in to the rage of our opponents, Papists and Anabaptists grow  arrogant. The Anabaptists hatch out some new monstrosity. The Papists  revive their old abominations. What to do? Let everybody become sure of  his calling and doctrine, that he may boldly say with Paul: \"But though  we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than ye  have received, let him be accursed.\"        VERSES 13, 14. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in    the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church    of God, and wasted it: And profited in the Jews' religion above many    my equals in mine own nation.    This passage does not contain doctrine. Paul adduces his own case for an  example. \"I have,\" he says, \"at one time defended the traditions of the  Pharisees more fiercely than any of your false apostles. Now, if the  righteousness of the Law had been worth anything I would never have  forsaken it. So carefully did I live up to the Law that I excelled many  of my companions. So zealous was I in defense of the Law that I wasted  the church of God.\"        VERSE 14. Being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my    fathers.    Speaking now of the Mosaic Law, Paul declares that he was wrapped up  in it. To the Philippians he wrote: \"As touching the law, a Pharisee;  concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness  which is in the law, blameless.\" He means to say, \"I can compare myself  with the best and holiest of all those who are of the circumcision. Let  them show me if they can, a more earnest defender of the Mosaic Law than  I was at one time. This fact, O Galatians, should have put you on your  guard against these deceivers who make so much of the Law. If anybody  ever had reason to glory in the righteousness of the Law, it was I.\"  I too may say that before I was enlightened by the Gospel, I was as  zealous for the papistical laws and traditions of the fathers as ever  a man was. I tried hard to live up to every law as best I could. I  punished myself with fasting, watching, praying, and other exercises  more than all those who today hate and persecute me. I was so much in  earnest that I imposed upon my body more than it could stand. I honored  the pope as a matter of conscience. Whatever I did, I did with a single  heart to the glory of God. But our opponents, well-fed idlers that they  are, will not believe what I and many others have endured.        VERSES 15, 16, 17. But when it pleased God, who separated me from    my mother's womb, and called me by his grace. To reveal his Son in    me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I    conferred not with flesh and blood: Neither went I up to Jerusalem to    them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and    returned again unto Damascus.    Here Paul relates that immediately upon being called by God to preach  the Gospel to the Gentiles, he went into Arabia without consulting a  single person. \"When it had pleased God,\" he writes, \"I did not deserve  it. I had been an enemy of Christ. I had blasphemed His Gospel. I had  shed innocent blood. In the midst of my frenzy I was called. Why? On  account of my outrageous cruelty? Indeed not. My gracious God who shows  mercy unto whom He will, pardoned all mine iniquities. He bestowed His  grace upon me, and called me for an apostle.\"    We also have come to the knowledge of the truth by the same kindness of  God. I crucified Christ daily in my cloistered life, and blasphemed God  by my wrong faith. Outwardly I kept myself chaste, poor, and obedient. I  was much given to fasting, watching, praying, saying of masses, and the  like. Yet under the cloak of my outward respectability I continually  mistrusted, doubted, feared, hated, and blasphemed God. My righteousness  was a filthy puddle. Satan loves such saints. They are his darlings,  for they quickly destroy their body and soul by depriving them of the  blessings of God's generous gifts.    I tell you I stood in awe of the pope's authority. To dissent from him I  considered a crime worthy of eternal death. I thought of John Huss as a  cursed heretic. I counted it a sin even to think of him. I would gladly  have furnished the wood to burn him. I would have felt I had done God a  real service.    In comparison with these sanctimonious hypocrites of the papacy,  publicans and harlots are not bad. They at least feel remorse. They  at least do not try to justify their wicked deeds. But these pretended  saints, so far from acknowledging their errors, justify them and regard  them as acceptable sacrifices unto God.        VERSE 15. When it pleased God.    \"By the favor of God I, a wicked and cursed wretch, a blasphemer,  persecutor, and rebel, was spared. Not content to spare me, God granted  unto me the knowledge of His salvation, His Spirit, His Son, the office  of an apostle, everlasting life.\" Paul speaking.    God not only pardoned our iniquities, but in addition overwhelmed us  with blessings and spiritual gifts. Many, however, are ungrateful.  Worse, by opening again a window to the devil many begin to loathe God's  Word, and end by perverting the Gospel.        VERSE 15. Who separated me from my mother's womb.    This is a Hebrew expression, meaning to sanctify, ordain, prepare. Paul  is saying, \"When I was not yet born God ordained me to be an apostle,  and in due time confirmed my apostleship before the world. Every gift,  be it small or great, spiritual or temporal, and every good thing I  should ever do, God has ordained while I was yet in my mother's womb  where I could neither think nor perform any good thing. After I was born  God supported me. Heaping mercy upon mercy, He freely forgave my sins,  replenishing me with His grace to enable me to learn what great things  are ours in Christ. To crown it all, He called me to preach the Gospel  to others.\"        VERSE 15. And called me by his grace.    \"Did God call me on account of my holy life? Or on account of my  pharisaical religion? Or on account of my prayers, fastings, and works?  Never. Well, then, it is certain God did not call me on account of my  blasphemies, persecutions, oppressions. What prompted Him to call me?  His grace alone.\"        VERSE 16. To reveal his Son to me.    We now hear what kind of doctrine was committed to Paul: The doctrine  of the Gospel, the doctrine of the revelation of the Son of God.  This doctrine differs greatly from the Law. The Law terrorizes the  conscience. The Law reveals the wrath and judgment of God. The Gospel  does not threaten. The Gospel announces that Christ is come to forgive  the sins of the world. The Gospel conveys to us the inestimable  treasures of God.        VERSE 16. That I might preach him among the heathen.    \"It pleased God,\" says the Apostle, \"to reveal himself in me. Why? For a  twofold purpose. That I personally should believe in the Son of God, and  that I should reveal Him to the Gentiles.\"    Paul does not mention the Jews, for the simple reason that he was the  called and acknowledged apostle of the Gentiles, although he preached  Christ also to the Jews.    We can hear the Apostle saying to himself: \"I will not burden the  Gentiles with the Law, because I am their apostle and not their  lawgiver. Not once did you Galatians hear me speak of the righteousness  of the Law or of works. My job was to bring you the Gospel. Therefore  you ought to listen to no teachers of the Law, but the Gospel: not  Moses, but the Son of God; not the righteousness of works, but the"]]]
