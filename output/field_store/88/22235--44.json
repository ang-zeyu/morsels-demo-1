Such a mongrel occupation, and such a motley  group, must strike you with astonishment--as a Sunday morning's recreation.    [Illustration]    By half past ten the congregation had assembled within the Church; and  every side-chapel (I think about twelve in number) began to be filled by  the penitent flocks: each bringing, or hiring, a rush-bottomed chair--with  which the churches are pretty liberally furnished, and of which the _Tarif_  (or terms of hire) is pasted upon the walls. There were, I am quite sure,  full eighteen women to one man: which may in part be accounted for, by the  almost uniform absence of a third of the male population occupied in the  fisheries. I think there could not have been fewer than two thousand souls  present. But what struck me as the most ludicrously solemn thing I had ever  beheld, was a huge tall figure, dressed like a drum-major, with a large  cocked hat and three white plumes, (the only covered male figure in the  congregation,) a broad white sash upon a complete suit of red, including  red stockings;--representing what in our country is called a _Beadle_. He  was a sturdy, grim-looking fellow; bearing an halberd in his right hand,  which he wielded with a sort of pompous swing, infusing terror into the  young, and commanding the admiration of the old. I must not, however, omit  to inform you, that half the service was scarcely performed when the  preacher mounted a pulpit, with a black cap on, and read a short sermon  from a printed book. I shall long have a distinct recollection of the  figure and attitude of the _Verger_ who attended the preacher. He followed  him to the pulpit, fastened the door, became stationary, and rested his  left arm over the railings of the stairs. Anon, he took out his snuff-box  with his right hand, and regaled himself with a pinch of snuff in the most  joyous and comfortably-abstracted manner imaginable. There he remained till  the conclusion of the discourse; not one word of which seemed to afford him  half the satisfaction as did the contents of his snuff-box.    _Military Mass_ was performed about an hour after, at the church of ST.  REMY, whither I strolled quietly, to witness the devotion of the  congregation previous to the entry of the soldiers; and I will not  dissemble being much struck and gratified by what I saw. There was more  simplicity: a smaller congregation: softer music: a lower-toned organ; less  rush of people; and in very many of the flock the most intense and  unfeigned expression of piety. At the elevation of the host, from the end  of the choir, (near which was suspended a white flag with the portrait of  the present King[28] upon it) a bell was rung from the tower of the church;  the sound, below, was soft and silver-toned--accompanied by rather a quick  movement on the organ, upon the diapason stop; which, united with the  silence and prostration of the congregation, might have commanded the  reverence of the most profane.    There is nothing, my dear friend, more gratifying, in a foreign land, than  the general appearance of earnestness of devotion on a sabbath day;  especially within the HOUSE OF GOD. However, I quickly heard the clangor of  the trumpet, the beat of drums, the measured tramp of human feet, and up  marched two or three troops of the national guard to perform military mass.  I retired precipitately to the Inn, being well pleased to have escaped this  strange and distracting sight: so little in harmony with the rites and  ceremonies of our own church, and in truth so little accordant with the  service which I had just beheld.      [22] [Mons. Licquet says that there were about 17,000 souls in 1824; so      that the above number may be that of the amount of its _present_      population. \"Several changes (says my French translator) have taken      place at Dieppe since I saw it: among the rest, there is a magnificent      establishment of BATHS, where a crowd of people, of the first      distinction, every year resort.

Licquet remarks thus: \"M. Dibdin's expression      conveys too general an idea. It is true that _popular_ opinion      attributes the erection of our gothic edifices to the ENGLISH: but      there exists _another_ opinion, which is not deceptive upon this      subject.\" What is meant to be here conveyed? Either the popular      opinion is true or false; and it is a matter of perfect indifference      to the author whether it be one or the other. For Mons. Licquet's      comfort, I will freely avow that I believe it to be _false_.]    [28] [Louis XVIII.]          LETTER III.    VILLAGE AND CASTLE OF ARQUES. SABBATH AMUSEMENTS. MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.  BOULEVARDS.      As I had received especial injunctions from our friend P--- not to leave  Dieppe without paying a visit to the famous _Chateau d'Arques_[29], in its  neighbourhood, I resolved to seize the opportunity of a tolerably fair, or  rather gray-looking day, to go and pay due homage to those venerable  remains of antiquity. The road thither is completely rural: apple-trees,  just beginning to burst their blossoms; hamlets, small farm-houses: a  profusion of rich herbage of various kinds--delighted and regaled me as I  pursued my tranquil walk. The country is of a gently-undulating character;  but the flats or meadows, between the parallel ranges of hills, are subject  to constant inundation from the sea; and in an agricultural point of view  are consequently of little use, except for summer grazing of the cattle.    It was drawing on to vespers as I approached the _Village of Arques_. The  old castle had frequently peeped out upon me, in my way thither, from its  elevated situation; but being resolved to see \"all that could be seen,\" a  French village, for the first time, was not to be overlooked. For a country  church, I know of few finer ones than that of Arques.[30]    The site of the castle is admirable. My approach was to the western  extremity; which, as you look down, brings the village and church of Arques  in the back ground. If the eye were to be considered as a correct judge,  this venerable pile, composed of hard flint-stone, intermixed with brick,  would perhaps claim precedence, on the score of antiquity, over most of the  castles of the middle ages. A deep moat, now dry pasture land, with a bold  acclivity before you, should seem to bid defiance, even in times of old, to  the foot and the spear of the invader. There are circular towers at the  extremities, and a square citadel or donjon within. To the north, a good  deal of earth has been recently thrown against the bases of the wall. The  day harmonised admirably with the venerable object before me. The sunshine  lasted but for a minute: when afterwards a gloom prevailed, and not a  single catch of radiant light gilded any portion of the building. All was  quiet, and of a sombre aspect,--and what _you_, in your admiration of art,  would call in perfectly \"fine keeping.\"    I descended the hill, bidding a long adieu to this venerable relic of the  hardihood of other times, and quickened my pace towards Dieppe. In gaining  upon the town, I began to discern groups of rustics, as well as of  bourgeoises, assembling and mingling in the dance. The women never think of  wearing bonnets, and you have little idea how picturesquely the red and  blue[31] (the colours of Raffaelle's Madonnas) glanced backwards and  forwards amidst the fruit trees, to the sound of the spirit-stirring  violin. The high, stiff, starched cauchoise, with its broad flappers, gave  the finishing stroke to the novelty and singularity of the scene; and to  their credit be it spoken, the women were much more tidily dressed than the  men. The couples are frequently female, for want of a sufficient number of  swains; but, whether correctly or incorrectly paired, they dance with  earnestness, if not with grace. It was a picture a la Teniers, without its  occasional grossness. This then, said I to myself, is what I have so often  heard of the sabbath-gambols of the French--and long may they enjoy them!  They are surely better than the brutal orgies of the pot-house, or the  fanatical ravings of the tabernacle.[32]    A late plain dinner, with my favourite vin ordinaire, recruited my  strength, and kept me in perfectly good humour with Dieppe.    The deportment of the _Dieppois_[33] towards the English, is, upon the  whole, rather gracious than otherwise; because the town profits by the  liberality and love of expense of the latter. Yet the young ones, as soon  as they can lisp, are put in training for pronouncing the _G---- d----_;  and a few horribly-deformed and importunate beggars are for ever assailing  the doors of the hotels. But beggary is nothing like so frightful an evil  as I had anticipated. The general aspect of the town seems to indicate the  poverty of the inhabitants; their houses being too large to be entirely  occupied. Bonaparte appears to have been anxious about the strengthening of  the harbour; the navigation into which is somewhat difficult and intricate.
