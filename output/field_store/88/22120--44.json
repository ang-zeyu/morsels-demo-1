One of the ladders  happened to be firmer than the generality of its kind; but,  unfortunately, its legs were of unequal lengths, and so it turned round  with one of my sisters, leaving her clinging like a cat to the under  side. When the bars are sufficiently loose, a difference of a few inches  in the lengths of the legs is not of so much importance.]    [Footnote 17: M. Thury found this hole, and fathomed it to a depth of  6-1/2 metres.]             *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER III.    THE LOWER GLACIERE OF THE PRE DE S. LIVRES.      I had intended to walk on from S. Georges to Biere, after returning from  the glaciere last described, and thence, the next morning, to the Pre de  S. Livres, the mountain pasturage of the commune of S. Livres,[18] a  village near Aubonne. But Renaud advised a change of plan, and the  result showed that his advice was good. He said that the _fermier_ of  the Glaciere of S. Livres generally lived in S. Georges, and, if he were  at home, would be the best guide to the glaciere; while the distance  from S. Georges was, if anything, rather less than the distance from  Biere; so that by remaining at the Cavalier for another night the walk  to Biere would be saved, and the possibility of finding no competent  guide there would be evaded. Jules Mignot, the farmer in question, was  at home, and promised to go to the glaciere in the morning, pledging his  word and all that he was worth for the existence and soundness of the  ladders; a matter of considerable importance, for M. Thury had been  unable to reach the ice, as also my sisters, by reason of a failure in  this respect.    In the course of the evening Mignot came in, and confidentially took the  other chair. He wished to state that he had three _associes_ in working  the glaciere, and that one of them knew of a similar cave, half an hour  from the one more generally known; the _associe_ had found it two years  before, and had not seen it since, and he believed that no one else knew  where it was to be found. If I cared to visit it, the _associe_ would  accompany us, but there was some particular reason--here he relapsed  into patois--why this other man could not by himself serve as guide to  both glacieres. As this meant that I must have two guides, and suggested  that perhaps the right rendering of _associe_ was 'accomplice,' the  negotiation nearly came to a violent end; but the farmer was so  extremely explanatory and convincing, that I gave him another chance,  asking him how much the two meant to have, and telling him that,  although I could not see the necessity for two guides, I only wished to  do what was right. He expressed his conviction of the truth of this  statement with such fervour, that I could only hope his moderation might  be as great as his faith. He took the usual five minutes to make up his  mind what to say, going through abstruse calculations with a brow  demonstratively bent, and, to all appearance, reckoning up exactly what  was the least it could be done for, consistently with his duty to  himself and his family. Then he asked, with an air of resignation, as if  he were throwing himself and his _associe_ away, 'Fifteen francs, then,  would monsieur consider too much?' 'Certainly, far too much; twelve  francs would be enormous. But, for the pleasure of his company and that  of his friend, I should be happy to give that sum for the two, and they  must feed themselves.' He jumped at the offer, with an alacrity which  showed that I had much under-estimated his margin in putting it at three  francs; and with many expressions of anticipatory gratitude, and  promises of axes and ropes in case of emergency, he bowed himself out.  The event proved that both the men were really valuable, and they got  something over the six francs a-piece.    The rain had been steadily increasing in intensity for the last  twenty-four hours, from the insidious steeping of a Scotch mist to the  violence of a chronic thunderstorm, and had about reached this crisis  when we started in the morning for the Pre de S. Livres. I had already  tested its effects before breakfast, in a search for the Renaud of the  day before, who had made statements regarding the ice at S. Georges, and  the time of cutting it, which a night's reflection showed to be false.  To search for Henri Renaud in the village of S. Georges, was something  like making an enquiry of a certain porter for the rooms of Mr. John  Jones. The landlady of the Cavalier was responsible for the first stage  of the journey, asserting that he lived two doors beyond the next  auberge, evidently with a feeling that it was wrong so far to patronise  the rival house as to live near it. That, however, was not the same  Henri Renaud; and a house a few yards off was recommended as a likely  place, where, instead of Henri, a Louis Renaud turned up, shivering  under the eaves in company with the _fermier_, who introduced Louis in  due form as the accomplice. They received conjointly and submissively a  lecture on the absurdity of calling it a rainy morning, and the  impossibility of staying at home, even if it came on much worse, and  then pointed the way to the true Henri Renaud, half-way down the  village. When I arrived at the place indicated, and consulted a  promiscuous Swiss as to the abode of the object of my search, he  exclaimed, 'Henri Renaud? I am he.' 'But,' it was objected, 'it is the  _marchand de bois_ who is wanted.' 'Precisely, Henri Renaud, marchand de  bois; it is I.' 'But, it is the cutter of ice in the glaciere.' 'Ah, a  different Henri. That Henri is in bed in the house yonder,' and so at  last he was found. When finally unearthed, Henri confessed that when he  had said _spring_ the day before, he ought to have said _autumn_, and  that by autumn he meant November and December. Enquiries elsewhere  showed that the end of summer was what he really meant, if he meant to  tell the truth.    Our route for the glaciere followed the high road which leads by the  Asile de Marchairuz to La Vallee, as far as the well-known Chalet de la  S. Georges; and then the character of the way changed rapidly for the  worse, and we took to the wet woods. After a time, the wood ceased for a  while, and a large expanse of smooth rock showed itself, rising slightly  from the horizontal, and so slippery in its present wet condition that  we could not pass up it. Then woods again, and then the montagnes of  _Sous la Roche_, and _La Foireuse_, till at last, in two hours, the Pre  de S. Livres was achieved. The fog was so dense that nothing could be  seen of the general lie of the country; but the _thalweg_ was a  sufficient guide, and after due perseverance we came upon the glaciere,  not many yards from that line, on the north slope of the open valley,  about 4,500 feet above the sea.    To prevent cattle from falling into the pit, a wall has been built round  the trees in which it lies. The circumference of this wall is 435 feet,  but there are so many trees at the upper end of the enclosure that this  gives an exaggerated idea of the size of the pit. The men fed while the  preliminary measurements were being made; and when this was  accomplished, they pressed their bottle of wine upon me so hospitably  that I was obliged to antedate the result which its appearance promised,  and plead _mal d'estomac_. Of all things, it is most unwise to give a  reason for a negative, and so it proved in this instance; for they  promptly felicitated themselves and me on the good luck by which it  happened that they had brought a wine famous on all the cote as a remedy  for that somewhat vague complaint--a homoeopathic remedy in allopathic  doses.    The glaciere is entered by a natural pit in the gentle slope of grass,  not much unlike the pit of La Genolliere, but wider, and covered at  the bottom with snow.[19] The first ladder leads down to a ledge of  rock on which bushes and trees grow, and this ledge it is possible to  reach without a ladder; the next ladder leads on to the deep snow, and  descent by any ordinary manner of climbing is in this case quite  impossible.[20] The snow slopes down towards a lofty arch in the rock  which forms the north-west side of the pit, and this arch is the  entrance to the glaciere; it is 28-3/4 feet wide, and as soon as we  passed under it we found that the snow became ice, and it was  necessary to cut steps; for the surface of underground ice is so  slippery, unlike the surface of ordinary glaciers, that the slightest  defect from the horizontal makes the use of the axe advisable. The  stream of ice falls gradually, spreading out laterally like a fan, so  as to accommodate itself to the shape of the cave, which it fills up  to the side walls; it increases in breadth from 28-3/4 feet at the top  to 72 feet at the bottom of the slope, and the distance from the top  of the first ladder to this point is 177 feet. Here we were arrested  by a strange wall of ice 22 feet high, down which there seemed at  first no means of passing; but finding an old ladder frozen into a  part of the wall, we chopped out holes between the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#7)"],[1,"hat,  does he fear a hidden fate from any other quarter. The soldier dreads  the arrows and the fleet retreat of the Parthian; the Parthian, chains  and an Italian prison; but the unexpected assault of death has carried  off, and will carry off, the world in general. How near was I seeing the  dominions of black Proserpine, and Aeacus sitting in judgment; the  separate abodes also of the pious, and Sappho complaining in her Aeohan  lyre of her own country damsels; and thee, O Alcaeus, sounding in fuller  strains on thy golden harp the distresses of exile, and the distresses  of war. The ghosts admire them both, while they utter strains worthy of  a sacred silence; but the crowded multitude, pressing with their  shoulders, imbibes, with a more greedy ear, battles and banished  tyrants. What wonder? Since the many headed monster, astonished at those  lays, hangs down his sable ears; and the snakes, entwined in the hair of  the furies, are soothed. Moreover, Prometheus and the sire of Pelops are  deluded into an insensibility of their torments, by the melodious sound:  nor is Orion any longer solicitous to harass the lions, or the fearful  lynxes.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIV.    TO POSTUMUS.      Alas! my Postumus, my Postumus, the fleeting years gilde on; nor will  piety cause any delay to wrinkles, and advancing old age, and  insuperable death. You could not, if you were to sacrifice every passing  day three hundred bulls, render propitious pitiless Pluto, who confines  the thrice-monstrous Geryon and Tityus with the dismal Stygian stream,  namely, that stream which is to be passed over by all who are fed by the  bounty of the earth, whether we be kings or poor ninds. In vain shall we  be free from sanguinary Mars, and the broken billows of the hoarse  Adriatic; in vain shall we be apprehensive for ourselves of the noxious  South, in the time of autumn. The black Cocytus wandering with languid  current, and the infamous race of Danaus, and Sisyphus, the son of the  Aeolus, doomed to eternal toil, must be visited; your land and house and  pleasing wife must be left, nor shall any of those trees, which you are  nursing, follow you, their master for a brief space, except the hated  cypresses; a worthier heir shall consume your Caecuban wines now guarded  with a hundred keys, and shall wet the pavement with the haughty wine,  more exquisite than what graces pontifical entertainment.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XV.    AGAINST THE LUXURY OF THE ROMANS.      The palace-like edifices will in a short time leave but a few acres for  the plough; ponds of wider extent than the Lucrine lake will be every  where to be seen; and the barren plane-tree will supplant the elms. Then  banks of violets, and myrtle groves, and all the tribe of nosegays shall  diffuse their odors in the olive plantations, which were fruitful to  their preceding master. Then the laurel with dense boughs shall exclude  the burning beams. It was not so prescribed by the institutes of  Romulus, and the unshaven Cato, and ancient custom. Their private income  was contracted, while that of the community was great. No private men  were then possessed of galleries measured by ten-feet rules, which  collected the shady northern breezes; nor did the laws permit them to  reject the casual turf [for their own huts], though at the same time  they obliged them to ornament in the most sumptuous manner, with new  stone, the buildings of the public, and the temples of the gods, at a  common expense.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XVI.    TO GROSPHUS.      O Grosphus, he that is caught in the wide Aegean Sea; when a black  tempest has obscured the moon, and not a star appears with steady light  for the mariners, supplicates the gods for repose: for repose, Thrace  furious in war; the quiver-graced Medes, for repose neither purchasable  by jewels, nor by purple, nor by gold. For neither regal treasures nor  the consul's officer can remove the wretched tumults of the mind, nor  the cares that hover about splendid ceilings. That man lives happily on  a little, who can view with pleasure the old-fashioned family  salt-cellar on his frugal board; neither anxiety nor sordid avarice robs  him of gentle sleep. Why do we, brave for a short season, aim at many  things? Why do we change our own for climates heated by another sun?  Whoever, by becoming an exile from his country, escaped likewise from  himself? Consuming care boards even brazen-beaked ships: nor does it  quit the troops of horsemen, for it is more fleet than the stags, more  fleet than the storm-driving east wind. A mind that is cheerful in its  present state, will disdain to be solicitous any further, and can  correct the bitters of life with a placid smile. Nothing is on all hands  completely blessed. A premature death carried off the celebrated  Achilles; a protracted old age wore down Tithonus; and time perhaps may  extend to me, what it shall deny to you. Around you a hundred flocks  bleat, and Sicilian heifers low; for your use the mare, fit for the  harness, neighs; wool doubly dipped in the African purple-dye, clothes  you: on me undeceitful fate has bestowed a small country estate, and the  slight inspiration of the Grecian muse, and a contempt for the malignity  of the vulgar.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XVII.    TO MAECENAS.      Why dost thoti kill me with thy complaints? 'Tis neither agreeable to  the gods, nor to me, that thou shouldest depart first, O Maecenas, thou  grand ornament and pillar of my affairs. Alas! if an untimely blow hurry  away thee, a part of my soul, why do I the other moiety remain, my value  lost, nor any longer whole? That [fatal] day shall bring destruction  upon us both. I have by no means taken a false oath: we will go, we will  go, whenever thou shalt lead the way, prepared to be fellow-travelers in  the last journey. Me nor the breath of the fiery Chimaera, nor  hundred-handed Gyges, were he to rise again, shall ever tear from thee:  such is the will of powerful Justice, and of the Fates. Whether Libra or  malignant Scorpio had the ascendant at my natal hour, or Capricon the  ruler of the western wave, our horoscopes agree in a wonderful manner.  Thee the benign protection of Jupiter, shining with friendly aspect,  rescued from the baleful influence of impious Saturn, and retarded the  wings of precipitate destiny, at the time the crowded people with  resounding applauses thrice hailed you in the theatre: me the trunk of a  tree, falling upon my skull, would have dispatched, had not Faunus, the  protector of men of genius, with his right hand warded off the blow. Be  thou mindful to pay the victims and the votive temple; I will sacrifice  an humble lamb.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XVIII.    AGAINST AVARICE AND LUXURY.      Nor ivory, nor a fretted ceiling adorned with gold, glitters in my  house: no Hymettian beams rest upon pillars cut out of the extreme parts  of Africa; nor, a pretended heir, have I possessed myself of the palace  of Attalus, nor do ladies, my dependants, spin Laconian purple for my  use. But integrity, and a liberal vein of genius, are mine: and the man  of fortune makes his court to me, who am but poor. I importune the gods  no further, nor do I require of my friend in power any larger  enjoyments, sufficiently happy with my Sabine farm alone. Day is driven  on by day, and the new moons hasten to their wane. You put out marble to  be hewn, though with one foot in the grave; and, unmindful of a  sepulcher, are building houses; and are busy to extend the shore of the  sea, that beats with violence at Baiae, not rich enough with the shore  of the mainland. Why is it, that through avarice you even pluck up the  landmarks of your neighbor's ground, and trespass beyond the bounds of  your clients; and wife and husband are turned out, bearing in their  bosom their household gods and their destitute children? Nevertheless,  no court more certainly awaits its wealthy lord, than the destined limit  of rapacious Pluto. Why do you go on? The impartial earth is opened  equally to the poor and to the sons of kings; nor has the life-guard  ferryman of hell, bribed with gold, re-conducted the artful Prometheus.  He confines proud Tantalus; and the race of Tantalus, he condescends,  whether invoked or not, to relieve the poor freed from their labors.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIX.    ON BACCHUS.    A DITHYRAMBIC, OR DRINKING SONG.      I saw Bacchus (believe it, posterity) dictating strains among the remote  rocks, and the nymphs learning them, and the ears of the goat-footed  satyrs all attentive. Evoe! my mind trembles with recent dread, and my  soul, replete with Bacchus, has a tumultuous joy, Evoe! spare me,  Bacchus; spare me, thou who art formidable for thy dreadful thyrsus. It  is granted me to sing the wanton Bacchanalian priestess, and the  fountain of wine, and rivulets flowing with milk, and to tell again of  the honeys distilling from the hollow trunks. It is granted me likewise  to celebrate the honor added to the constellations by your happy spouse,  and the palace of Pentheus demolished with no light ruin, and the  perdition of Thracian. Lycurgus. You command the rivers, you the  barbarian sea. You, moist with wine, on lonely mountain-tops bind the  hair of your Thracian priestesses with a knot of vipers without hurt.  You, when the impious band of giants scaled the realms of father Jupiter  through the sky, repelled Rhoetus, with the paws and horrible jaw of the  lion-shape [you had assumed]. Thou, reported to be better fitted for  dances, and jokes and play, you were accounted insufficient for fight;  yet it then appeared, you, the same deity, was the mediator of peace and  war.
