An estimated  12 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free  status and by its summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited  by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The  principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of  cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic  integration is a potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its  duty-free status.

At any rate, it is certain that books can no more make  a character like Lincoln than they can make a poet like Shakespeare.        \"By books may Learning sometimes befall,      But Wisdom never by books at all,\"--    a saying peculiarly true of a man such as Lincoln.    A testimonial to the influence of this early reading upon his childish  mind was given by Lincoln himself many years afterwards. While on his  way to Washington to assume the duties of the Presidency he passed  through Trenton, New Jersey, and in a speech made in the Senate Chamber  at that place he said: \"May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I  mention that away back in my childhood, in the earliest days of my being  able to read, I got hold of a small book--such a one as few of the  younger members have seen, Weems's Life of Washington. I remember all  the accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for the  liberties of the country; and none fixed themselves upon my imagination  so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton. The crossing of the river,  the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time,  all fixed themselves in my memory more than any single Revolutionary  event; and you all know, for you have all been boys, how these early  impressions last longer than any others. I recollect thinking then, boy  even though I was, that there must have been something more than common  that these men struggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thing  which they struggled for, that something even more than National  Independence, that something that held out a great promise to all the  people of the world for all time to come, I am exceedingly anxious that  this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the people, shall be  perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that struggle  was made.\"    Another incident in regard to the ruined volume which Lincoln had  borrowed from Crawford is related by Mr. Lamon. \"For a long time,\" he  says, \"there was one person in the neighborhood for whom Lincoln felt a  decided dislike, and that was Josiah Crawford, who had made him pull  fodder for three days to pay for Weems's Washington. On that score he  was hurt and mad, and declared he would have revenge. But being a poor  boy, a fact of which Crawford had already taken shameful advantage when  he extorted three days' labor, Abe was glad to get work anywhere, and  frequently hired out to his old adversary. His first business in  Crawford's employ was daubing the cabin, which was built of unhewn logs  with the bark on. In the loft of this house, thus finished by his own  hands, he slept for many weeks at a time. He spent his evenings as he  did at home,--writing on wooden shovels or boards with 'a coal, or keel,  from the branch.' This family was rich in the possession of several  books, which Abe read through time and again, according to his usual  custom. One of the books was the 'Kentucky Preceptor,' from which Mrs.  Crawford insists that he 'learned his school orations, speeches, and  pieces to write.' She tells us also that 'Abe was a sensitive lad, never  coming where he was not wanted'; that he always lifted his hat, and  bowed, when he made his appearance; and that 'he was tender and kind,'  like his sister, who was at the same time her maid-of-all-work. His pay  was twenty-five cents a day; 'and when he missed time, he would not  charge for it.' This latter remark of Mrs. Crawford reveals the fact  that her husband was in the habit of docking Abe on his miserable wages  whenever he happened to lose a few minutes from steady work. The time  came, however, when Lincoln got his revenge for all this petty  brutality. Crawford was as ugly as he was surly. His nose was a  monstrosity--long and crooked, with a huge mis-shapen stub at the end,  surmounted by a host of pimples, and the whole as blue as the usual  state of Mr. Crawford's spirits. Upon this member Abe levelled his  attacks, in rhyme, song, and chronicle; and though he could not reduce  the nose he gave it a fame as wide as to the Wabash and the Ohio. It is  not improbable that he learned the art of making the doggerel rhymes in  which he celebrated Crawford's nose from the study of Crawford's own  'Kentucky Preceptor.'\"    Lincoln's sister Sarah was warmly attached to him, but was taken from  his companionship at an early age. It is said that her face somewhat  resembled his, that in repose it had the gravity which they both  inherited from their mother, but it was capable of being lighted almost  into beauty by one of her brother's ridiculous stories or sallies of  humor. She was a modest, plain, industrious girl, and was remembered  kindly by all who knew her. She was married to Aaron Grigsby at  eighteen, and died a year later. Like her brother, she occasionally  worked at the houses of the neighbors. She lies buried, not with her  mother, but in the yard of the old Pigeon Creek meeting-house.    A story which belongs to this period was told by Lincoln himself to Mr.  Seward and a few friends one evening in the Executive Mansion at  Washington. The President said: \"Seward, you never heard, did you, how I  earned my first dollar?\" \"No,\" rejoined Mr. Seward. \"Well,\" continued  Mr. Lincoln, \"I belonged, you know, to what they call down South the  'scrubs.' We had succeeded in raising, chiefly by my labor, sufficient  produce, as I thought, to justify me in taking it down the river to  sell. After much persuasion, I got the consent of mother to go, and  constructed a little flatboat, large enough to take a barrel or two of  things that we had gathered, with myself and the bundle, down to the  Southern market. A steamer was coming down the river. We have, you know,  no wharves on the Western streams; and the custom was, if passengers  were at any of the landings, for them to go out in a boat, the steamer  stopping and taking them on board. I was contemplating my new flatboat,  and wondering whether I could make it stronger or improve it in any way,  when two men came down to the shore in carriages with trunks. Looking at  the different boats, they singled out mine and asked, 'Who owns this?' I  answered somewhat modestly, 'I do.' 'Will you take us and our trunks to  the steamer?' asked one of them. 'Certainly,' said I. I was glad to have  the chance of earning something. I supposed that each of them would give  me two or three bits. The trunks were put on my flatboat, the passengers  seated themselves on the trunks, and I sculled them out to the steamer.  They got on board, and I lifted up their heavy trunks and put them on  the deck. The steamer was about to put on steam again, when I called out  to them that they had forgotten to pay me. Each man took from his pocket  a silver half-dollar and threw it into the bottom of my boat. I could  scarcely believe my eyes. Gentlemen, you may think it a little thing,  and in these days it seems to me a trifle; but it was a great event in  my life. I could scarcely credit that I, a poor boy, had earned a dollar  in less than a day,--that by honest work I had earned a dollar. The  world seemed wider and fairer to me. I was a more hopeful and confident  being from that time.\"    Notwithstanding the limitations of every kind which hemmed in the life  of young Lincoln, he had an instinctive feeling, born perhaps of his  eager ambition, that he should one day attain an exalted position. The  first betrayal of this premonition is thus related by Mr. Arnold:    \"Lincoln attended court at Booneville, to witness a murder trial, at  which one of the Breckenridges from Kentucky made a very eloquent speech  for the defense. The boy was carried away with admiration, and was so  enthusiastic that, although a perfect stranger, he could not resist  expressing his admiration to Breckenridge. He wanted to be a lawyer. He  went home, dreamed of courts, and got up mock trials, at which he would  defend imaginary prisoners. Several of his companions at this period of  his life, as well as those who knew him after he went to Illinois,  declare that he was often heard to say, not in joke, but seriously, as  if he were deeply impressed rather than elated with the idea: 'I shall  some day be President of the United States.' It is stated by many of  Lincoln's old friends that he often said while still an obscure man,  'Some day I shall be President.' He undoubtedly had for years some  presentiment of this.\"    At seventeen Lincoln wrote a clear, neat, legible hand, was quick at  figures and able to solve easily any arithmetical problem not going  beyond the \"Rule of Three.\" Mr. Arnold, noting these facts, says: \"I  have in my possession a few pages from his manuscript 'Book of Examples  in Arithmetic' One of these is dated March 1, 1826, and headed  'Discount,' and then follows, in his careful handwriting: 'A definition  of Discount,' 'Rules for its computation,' 'Proofs and Various  Examples,' worked out in figures, etc.; then 'Interest on money' is  treated in the same way, all in his own handwriting. I doubt whether it  would be easy to find among scholars of our common or high schools, or  any school of boys of the age of seventeen, a better written specimen of  this sort of work, or a better knowledge of figures than is indicated by  this book of Lincoln's, written at the age of seventeen.\"    In March, 1828, Lincoln went to work for old Mr. Gentry, the founder of  Gentryville. \"Early the next month the old gentleman furnished his son  Allen with a boat and a cargo of bacon and other produce with which he  was to go to New Orleans unless the stock should be sooner disposed of.  Abe, having been found faithful and efficient, was employed to accompany  the young man. He was paid eight dollars per month, and ate and slept on  board.\" The entire business of the trip "]]]
