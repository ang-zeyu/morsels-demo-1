So earnestly did he  labor for their conversion, that he has always been called the apostle to  the Indians. The mention of this holy man suggested to Grandfather the  propriety of giving a brief sketch of the history of the Indians, so far  as they were connected with the English colonists.    A short period before the arrival of the first Pilgrims at Plymouth, there  had been a very grievous plague among the red men; and the sages and  ministers of that day were inclined to the opinion, that Providence had  sent this mortality, in order to make room for the settlement of the  English. But I know not why we should suppose that an Indian's life is  less precious, in the eye of Heaven, than that of a white man. Be that as  it may, death had certainly been very busy with the savage tribes.    In many places the English found the wigwams deserted, and the corn-fields  growing to waste, with none to harvest the grain. There were heaps of  earth also, which, being dug open, proved to be Indian graves, containing  bows and flint-headed spears and arrows; for the Indians buried the dead  warrior's weapons along with him. In some spots, there were skulls and  other human bones, lying unburied. In 1633, and the year afterwards, the  smallpox broke out among the Massachusetts Indians, multitudes of whom  died by this terrible disease of the old world. These misfortunes made  them far less powerful than they had formerly been.    For nearly half a century after the arrival of the English, the red men  showed themselves generally inclined to peace and amity. They often made  submission, when they might have made successful war. The Plymouth  settlers, led by the famous Captain Miles Standish, slew some of them in  1623, without any very evident necessity for so doing. In 1636, and the  following year, there was the most dreadful war that had yet occurred  between the Indians and the English. The Connecticut settlers, assisted by  a celebrated Indian chief, named Uncas, bore the brunt of this war, with  but little aid from Massachusetts. Many hundreds of the hostile Indians  were slain, or burnt in their wigwams. Sassacus, their sachem, fled to  another tribe, after his own people were defeated; but he was murdered by  them, and his head was sent to his English enemies.    From that period, down to the time of King Philip's war, which will be  mentioned hereafter, there was not much trouble with the Indians. But the  colonists were always on their guard, and kept their weapons ready for the  conflict.    \"I have sometimes doubted,\" said Grandfather, when he had told these  things to the children, \"I have sometimes doubted whether there was more  than a single man, among our forefathers, who realized that an Indian  possesses a mind and a heart, and an immortal soul. That single man was  John Eliot. All the rest of the early settlers seemed to think that the  Indians were an inferior race of beings, whom the Creator had merely  allowed to keep possession of this beautiful country, till the white men  should be in want of it.    \"Did the pious men of those days never try to make Christians of them?\"  asked Laurence.    \"Sometimes, it is true,\" answered Grandfather, \"the magistrates and  ministers would talk about civilizing and converting the red people. But,  at the bottom of their hearts, they would have had almost as much  expectation of civilizing a wild bear of the woods, and making him fit for  paradise. They felt no faith in the success of any such attempts, because  they had no love for the poor Indians. Now Eliot was full of love for  them, and therefore so full of faith and hope, that he spent the labor of  a lifetime in their behalf.\"    \"I would have conquered them first, and then converted them,\" said  Charley.    \"Ah, Charley, there spoke the very spirit of our forefathers!\" replied  Grandfather. \"But Mr. Eliot had a better spirit. He looked upon them as  his brethren. He persuaded as many of them as he could, to leave off their  idle and wandering habits, and to build houses, and cultivate the earth,  as the English did. He established schools among them, and taught many of  the Indians how to read. He taught them, likewise, how to pray. Hence they  were called 'praying Indians.' Finally, having spent the best years of his  life for their good, Mr. Eliot resolved to spend the remainder in doing  them a yet greater benefit.\"    \"I know what that was!\" cried Laurence.    \"He sat down in his study,\" continued Grandfather, \"and began a  translation of the Bible into the Indian tongue. It was while he was  engaged in this pious work, that the mint-master gave him our great chair.  His toil needed it, and deserved it.\"    \"O, Grandfather, tell us all about that Indian Bible!\" exclaimed Laurence.  \"I have seen it in the library of the Athenaeum; and the tears came into my  eyes, to think that there were no Indians left to read it.\"          Chapter VIII      As Grandfather was a great admirer of the Apostle Eliot, he was glad to  comply with the earnest request which Laurence had made, at the close of  the last chapter. So he proceeded to describe how good Mr. Eliot labored,  while he was at work upon        THE INDIAN BIBLE      My dear children, what a task would you think it, even with a long  lifetime before you, were you bidden to copy every chapter and verse, and  word, in yonder great family Bible! Would not this be a heavy toil? But if  the task were, not to write off the English Bible, but to learn a  language, utterly unlike all other tongues,--a language which hitherto had  never been learned, except by the Indians themselves, from their mothers'  lips,--a language never written, and the strange words of which seemed  inexpressible by letters;--if the task were, first, to learn this new  variety of speech, and then to translate the Bible into it, and to do it  so carefully, that not one idea throughout the holy book should be  changed,--what would induce you to undertake this toil? Yet this was what  the Apostle Eliot did.    It was a mighty work for a man, now growing old, to take upon himself. And  what earthly reward could he expect from it? None; no reward on earth. But  he believed that the red men were the descendants of those lost tribes of  Israel of whom history has been able to tell us nothing, for thousands of  years. He hoped that God had sent the English across the ocean, Gentiles  as they were, to enlighten this benighted portion of his once chosen race.  And when he should be summoned hence, he trusted to meet blessed spirits  in another world, whose bliss would have been earned by his patient toil,  in translating the Word of God. This hope and trust were far dearer to  him, than any thing that earth could offer.    Sometimes, while thus at work, he was visited by learned men, who desired  to know what literary undertaking Mr. Elliot had in hand. They, like  himself, had been bred in the studious cloisters of a university, and were  supposed to possess all the erudition which mankind has hoarded up from  age to age. Greek and Latin were as familiar to them as the babble of  their childhood. Hebrew was like their mother tongue. They had grown gray  in study; their eyes were bleared with poring over print and manuscript by  the light of the midnight lamp.    And yet, how much had they left unlearned! Mr. Eliot would put into their  hands some of the pages, which he had been writing; and behold! the  gray-headed men stammered over the long, strange words, like a little  child in his first attempts to read. Then would the apostle call to him an  Indian boy, one of his scholars, and show him the manuscript, which had so  puzzled the learned Englishmen.    \"Read this, my child,\" said he, \"these are some brethren of mine, who  would fain hear the sound of thy native tongue.\"    Then would the Indian boy cast his eyes over the mysterious page, and read  it so skilfully, that it sounded like wild music. It seemed as if the  forest leaves were singing in the ears of his auditors, and as if the roar  of distant streams were poured through the young Indian's voice. Such were  the sounds amid which the language of the red man had been formed; and  they were still heard to echo in it.    The lesson being over, Mr. Eliot would give the Indian boy an apple or a  cake, and bid him leap forth into the open air, which his free nature  loved. The apostle was kind to children, and even shared in their sports,  sometimes. And when his visitors had bidden him farewell, the good man  turned patiently to his toil again.    No other Englishman had ever understood the Indian character so well, nor  possessed so great an influence over the New England tribes, as the  apostle did. His advice and assistance must often have been valuable to  his countrymen, in their transactions with the Indians. Occasionally,  perhaps, the governor and some of the counsellors came to visit Mr. Eliot.  Perchance they were seeking some method to circumvent the forest people.  They inquired, it may be, how they could obtain possession of such and  such a tract of their rich land. Or they talked of making the Indians  their servants, as if God had destined them for perpetual bondage to the  more powerful white man.    Perhaps, too, some warlike captain, dressed in his buff-coat, with a  corslet beneath it, accompanied the governor and counsellors. Laying his  hand upon his sword hilt, he would declare, that the only method of  dealing with the red men was to meet them with the sword drawn, and the  musket presented.    But the apostle resisted both the craft of the politician, and the  fierceness of the warrior.    \"Treat these sons of the forest as men and brethren,\" he would say, \"and  let us endeavor to make them Christians. Their forefathers were of that  chosen race, whom God delivered from Egyptian bondage. Perchance he has  destined us to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#7)"],[1,"by the opinion still stoutly  held by many persons that a good sportsman is necessarily a good  soldier, and that the qualities which ensure success in Athletics or  Sport make also for success in War: but this is true of certain of them  only. In so far as Athletics and Sport tend to manliness, self-reliance,  good comradeship, endurance of bodily hardship, and contempt of danger,  they are no doubt an excellent preparatory school for War. But there is  one quality without the possession of which no man is held to be a good  sportsman, and that is the acceptance of defeat or non-success with  equanimity and good-humour as \"part of the game.\" Without this quality  Athletics and Sport would, in fact, become impossible.    In the soldier, however, this temperament is a dangerous gift. It led to  reverses, captures, loss of convoys and other \"regrettable incidents\"  being regarded with stoical composure as \"part of the game\"; and the  victims were condoled with on their \"shocking bad luck.\" It would have  been difficult to discern from the bearing and demeanour of the typical  officer whether he was at the moment a prisoner of war in the Model  School at Pretoria, or had just taken part in the magnificent cavalry  charge by which Kimberley was relieved. The former plight did not  greatly depress him, nor did the latter phase of military life greatly  elate him. It is probable that the War would have been brought to a  successful close at a much earlier date if throughout the British Army  and especially among the officers hearty disgust and indignation at the  failures of the first few months had taken the place of a light-hearted  accommodation to circumstances. The companions of Ulysses may              With a frolic welcome take    The thunder and the sunshine,    but it is not War.    The British officer played at war in South Africa much in the same way  that he hunted or played cricket or polo at home. He enjoyed the sport  and the game, did his best for his own side, and rejoiced if he was  successful, but was not greatly disturbed when he lost. A dictum  attributed to the Duke of Wellington says that the Battle of Waterloo  was won upon the Playing Fields at Eton. It would not be so very far  from the truth to say that the guns at Sannah's Post were captured on  the polo-ground at Hurlingham; that Magersfontein was lost at Lord's;  that Spionkop was evacuated at Sandown; and that the war lingered on for  thirty-two months in the Quorn and Pytchley coverts.    The sporting view of War was recognized and confirmed in Army Orders and  official reports, in which the words \"bag,\" \"drive,\" \"stop,\" and some  other sporting terms not infrequently appeared. No one would reasonably  object to the judicious and illuminating use of metaphor, but there are  metaphors which impair the dignity of a cause and degrade it in the eyes  of those whose duty is to maintain that cause. When the advance of a  British Division at a critical period in the operations is frivolously  termed a \"drive,\" and when the men extended at ten paces' interval over  a wide front are called \"beaters,\" it is natural that the leaders should  look upon their work as analogous to the duties of a gamekeeper; and  when an artillery officer is instructed to \"pitch his shells well up,\"  he is encouraged to regard failure as no worse than the loss of a  cricket-match.    It was at least to be expected that in the use, care, and management of  horses upon which the success of a campaign, in which mounted men formed  an unusually large proportion of the troops engaged, so much depended,  the sporting instincts of the British officer would have made him  particularly efficient; yet the evidence given by General officers  before the Royal Commission showed that it was otherwise. They are  practically unanimous in the opinion that all branches of the mounted  troops were inefficient, except the artillery, whose work so far as  horses are concerned is akin to that of the skilful but unsporting farm  teamster or wagoner.    A nation greatly addicted to Sport, Games, and Athletics is a nation  lacking in that earnestness of moral purpose which should be its chief  strength for War. Amusements are regarded not as \"recreation\" or means  of refreshing and re-invigorating the mind and body for the duties of  life by a temporary change of occupation, but as the main objective of  existence.    A retrospect into history will show that the most efficient armies were  those in which the sporting instinct was non-existent. The armies which  in modern times have most satisfactorily performed the duties for which  armies are raised were those of Gustavus Adolphus, Napoleon, Moltke, and  Oyama. Each of these was the most perfect military instrument of its  day, and their exploits have never been surpassed. Yet neither the  Swedes, the French, the Germans, nor the Japanese were addicted to  Athletics or Sport. Their manly instincts were exercised, to the great  advantage of their countries, in skill at arms and in the Military  Art.[13]    The cult of Sport and Athletics sets up false ideals and lowers the  intellectual standard. Thousands of loafers, idlers, and work skirkers  live upon the anticipations or recollections of out-door sports when not  actually present at them, and are ready to spend their last shilling at  the turnstile of the ground on which a handful of football gladiators  are at play: and are more exasperated by the defeat of the team which  they patronise in a Cup Tie match than they would be by the loss of a  battle by the British Army. There is this to be said for the working  classes, that in youth, if not longer, they in general endure a hard and  strenuous life, and at least in their school years they cannot indulge a  passion for amusement; whereas the class from which the officers of the  British Army are drawn is encouraged on the other hand to indulge it  from childhood. Owing to the prominence given in the Public Schools and  Universities to games and athletics and to the esteem in which  proficiency in these is held, youths of the upper middle and upper  classes are dumped upon the world not humbly but arrogantly ignorant of  almost everything necessary to qualify them to take their proper place  in the community. They have subsisted in a rarefied intellectual  atmosphere, and to fit themselves for any profession for which they may  have an inclination they have to be forced or \"crammed\" in a saturated  atmosphere by which they are congested. The result is that \"young  officers now join the service with a very fair idea of cricket and  football, bridge, and even motor-driving; but with no education in  patriotism; no real acquaintance with the history or geography of their  own or other countries; unable to write English concisely, or even  grammatically;[14] unaccustomed to read general information for  themselves other than under the headings of the _Daily Mail_; unable to  talk a foreign language; and with no knowledge of the sciences which are  of military use.\"[15] To this may be added the fact that these young  dullards, the supply of whom is dwindling, are, on joining the service,  encouraged and accepted rather with reference to their sporting and  social qualities than to their military capacity.    England, as a sporting, athletic, and game-loving nation, has of late  years suffered many rebuffs. By the United States she has been taught  the scientific method of riding racehorses, and also of sailing yachts;  she has been defeated in polo by a Transatlantic team; her selected  representative horsemen are unsuccessful in the International Military  Tournaments; she cannot defeat Australia on the cricket field; a Belgian  crew holds its own at Henley. If these rebuffs tend to abate the mania  for watching the performances of a handsome but not particularly  intelligent quadruped, and for studying the various methods of imparting  motion to a Ball and to show the vanity of the passion for sports and  games when indulged to excess, they will have served their purpose. The  nation, disgusted at its want of success in its favourite pursuits, may  perhaps turn its manhood to the noblest pursuit of all, the defence of  the Fatherland; and then it will not be the betting and football news  that has to be blacked out of the daily papers in the free libraries,  but the bi-weekly military gazettes, the reports from the military  stations and the Special Correspondents' letters from Salisbury Plain  during the manoeuvres.
