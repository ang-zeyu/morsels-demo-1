Directly she arrives,  do not fail to call upon us, for we will bestow all sorts of good  gifts upon her. You have only to hold this bouquet, and mention each  flower, thinking of us, and be assured that we shall at once appear in  your chamber.\"    The Queen, transported with joy, and overcome with gratitude, threw  herself upon their necks, and warmly embraced them; she then spent  several hours admiring the wonders of the palace and its gardens, and  it was not until evening that she returned to her attendants, who were  in a serious state of anxiety at the prolonged absence of Her Majesty.    [Illustration]    Not very long afterwards, when the Queen was once more at home in her  Royal Palace, a baby Princess was born, whom she named Desiree. Then  taking the bouquet into her hand, the Queen, one by one, pronounced  the names of the flowers, when there immediately appeared, flying  through the air in elegant chariots drawn by different kinds of birds,  the six Fairies who entered the apartment, bearing beautiful presents  for the little baby. Marvellously fine linen, but so strong that it  could be worn a hundred years without going into holes, lace of the  finest, with the history of the world worked into its pattern, toys  of all descriptions that a child would love to play with, and a cradle  ornamented with rubies and diamonds, and supported by four Cupids  ready to rock it should the baby cry. But, best of all, the Fairies  endowed the little Princess with beauty, and virtue, and health, and  every good thing that could be desired.    The Queen was thanking the Fairies a thousand times for all their  favours, when the door opened, and a crab appeared.    \"Ungrateful Queen,\" said the crab, \"you have not deigned to remember  me, the Fairy of the Fountain; and to punish your ingratitude, if the  Princess sees daylight before she is fifteen years old, she will have  cause to repent it, and it may cost her her life. It was well I took  the form of a crab, for your friendship instead of advancing has gone  backwards.\" Then in spite of all the Queen and the Fairies could say,  the crab went backwards out of the door, leaving them in the saddest  consternation, and it was long before they could decide what was best  to be done.    Then, with three waves of a wand, the Fairies caused a high tower to  spring up; it had neither door nor window, an underground passage was  made, through which everything necessary could be carried, and in  this tower the little Princess was shut up and there she lived by  candlelight, where never a glimpse of the sun could come.    When the Princess Desiree was fourteen years old, the Queen had her  portrait painted, and copies of it were carried to all the Courts  in the world. All the Princes admired it greatly, but there was one  Prince, named Guerrier, who loved it above everything; he used to  stand before the picture and avow his passion, just as if it heard  what he said, and at last he told the King, his father.    \"You have resolved that I shall marry the Princess Noire, but this I  can never do, so great is my love for the Princess Desiree.\"    \"But where have you seen her?\" enquired the King.    The Prince hastened to fetch her portrait, and the King was so greatly  struck by Desiree's beauty that he agreed to follow his son's wishes  and break off his engagement with the Princess Noire, that he might  wed the Princess Desiree. So the King despatched as ambassador a rich  young lord named Becafigue.    Becafigue was devoted to Prince Guerrier, and he fitted out a most  splendid retinue to visit the Princess Desiree's Court. Besides  numerous magnificent presents, Becafigue took with him the Prince's  portrait, which had been painted by such a clever artist that it would  speak; it could not exactly answer questions, but could make certain  remarks. It was truly a speaking likeness of the young Prince.  Desiree's father and mother were delighted when they heard that the  Prince Guerrier was seeking their daughter's hand in marriage, for  they knew him to be a brave and noble young man. But as it still  wanted three months to the Princess's fifteenth year, warned by  the Fairy Tulip, who had taken Desiree under her special care, they  refused to let him see their daughter or to let her yet marry the  Prince Guerrier, but they showed her the Prince's portrait, with  which she was greatly pleased, and particularly when it said, \"Lovely  Desiree, you cannot imagine how ardently I am waiting for you; come  soon into our Court to make it beautiful by your presence.\"    [Illustration]    When Prince Guerrier saw the ambassador return without Desiree, he  was so terribly disappointed that he could neither eat nor sleep, and  before long fell dangerously ill.    Meanwhile Desiree had no less pleasure in looking at the Prince's  portrait than he had had admiring hers, and this was soon discovered  by those around her, and among others Giroflee and Longue Epine, her  maids of honour. Giroflee loved her passionately and faithfully, but  Longue Epine was full of envy of the Princess who was so good and  beautiful, and, besides Longue Epine, Desiree had another enemy,  and that was the Princess Noire, to whom Prince Guerrier had been  betrothed. This Princess Noire now went to the Fairy of the Fountain,  who was her best friend, and begged her to take revenge upon Princess  Desiree, and this the Fairy promised to do. Meanwhile once more  Becafigue came to the capital where Desiree's father lived, and  throwing himself at the King's feet, besought him in most touching  words to let his daughter go with him at once to the Prince, who would  surely die if he could not behold her.    When Princess Desiree heard of the Prince's illness, she suggested  that she should set out without delay, but in a dark carriage,  that only at night should be opened to give her food. This plan was  approved of; the ambassador was told, and he departed full of joy. So  in a carriage like a large dark box, shut up with her Lady in Waiting  and her two Maids of Honour, Giroflee and Longue Epine, Princess  Desiree departed for Prince Guerrier's Court.    Perhaps you will remember that Longue Epine did not like Princess  Desiree, but she greatly admired Prince Guerrier, for she had seen his  portrait speaking, and she had told her mother, the Lady in Waiting,  that she should die if he married Desiree.    The King and Queen had begged the Lady in Waiting to take the greatest  of care of their dear daughter, and above all to be heedful that she  did not see the light of day until her fifteenth birthday, saying that  the ambassador had promised that until then she should be placed where  there was no other light than that of candles. But now as they drew  near their destination, while it was broad daylight the wicked woman,  urged by her envious daughter, Longue Epine, all at once took a large  knife which she had brought for the purpose, and with it cut the  covering of the carriage.    Then, for the first time, the Princess Desiree saw the light of day!!!  Hardly had she perceived it when, uttering a deep sigh, she threw  herself from the carriage, and in the form of a white fawn fleetly  fled into a forest near by.    The Fairy of the Fountain, who was the cause of this disaster seeing  that all who were accompanying the Princess were about to hasten to  the town to tell the Prince Guerrier what had happened, called up a  great thunderstorm and scattered them in every direction. Only the  Lady in Waiting, Longue Epine and Giroflee were left, Giroflee, who  ran after her mistress, making the trees and rocks echo with her  mournful calls. Then Longue Epine clothed herself in the rich bridal  robes provided for Desiree. She placed the crown upon her head, the  sceptre and orb she carried in her hands, so that all should take her  for the Princess. With her mother bearing her train she gravely walked  in the direction of the town.    [Illustration: \"A GREAT THUNDERSTORM SCATTERED THEM IN EVERY  DIRECTION.\"]    They had not gone far when a brilliant procession came towards them,  amongst whom was the sick Prince in a litter, and to those in advance  Longue Epine announced that she was the Princess Desiree, with her  Lady in Waiting, but that a jealous Fairy had sent a thunderstorm  which had destroyed her carriage and scattered her other attendants.  When the Prince was told of this, he could not refrain from saying  to the messengers: \"Now acknowledge, is she not truly a miracle of  beauty, a Princess beyond compare?\"    No one replied at first, and then one of the boldest said,    \"Sir, you will see; apparently the fatigue of the journey has somewhat  changed her.\" The Prince was surprised, but when he saw Longue Epine  words fail to express what he felt.    She was so tall that it was alarming, and the garments of the Princess  hardly came to her knees. She was frightfully thin, and her nose,  which was more hooked than a parrot's beak, shone like a danger  signal. Then her teeth were black and uneven, and, in fact, she was as  ugly as Desiree was beautiful.    At first the Prince could not speak a word, he simply gazed at her  in amazement. Then he said, turning to his father, \"We have been  deceived, that portrait was painted to mislead us. It will be the  death of me.\"    \"What do I hear, they have deceived you,\" fiercely exclaimed Longue  Epine.    \"It is not to be wondered at,\" remarked the King, \"that your father  kept such a treasure shut up for fifteen years.\"    Then he and the Prince turned towards the town, and the false Princess  and the Lady in Waiting, without any ceremony, were mounted each  behind a soldier and taken to be shut up in a castle.

The border is completed as  follows:--* 1 double, 6 purl divided by 1 double, 1 purled stitch  fastened on to the middle purl of a circle of the 1st row, 1 plain, 6  purl divided by 1 double, join the stitch into a circle, turn the lace  so that the rosettes are turned upwards, fasten the cotton on to the  purl of the next branch of the next rosette, work 1 double, 7 purl  divided by 1 double, 1 double; fasten the cotton on to the purl of the  next branch, * work 1 double, 8 purl divided by 1 double, 1 double;  fasten the cotton on to the next branch, repeat once more from *, work 1  double, 7 purl divided by 1 double, 1 double, and repeat from * to the  end of the lace.           *       *       *       *       *    40.--_Lace in Tatting and Crochet_.    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 50;  tatting-pin No. 2; crochet cotton No. 60.    [Illustration: 40.--Lace in Tatting and Crochet.]    The beauty of this lace depends entirely upon the regularity of the  tatting. The purl stitches must be very regularly made, the circles must  be drawn up tight. Make * 1 circle, consisting of 4 double, 8 purl  divided by 2 double, 4 double; close to this circle a second one; 5  double fastened on the last purl of the preceding circle, 8 times 2  double divided by 1 purl, 1 purl    5 double, close to the 2nd circle a third one similar to the first, but  instead of working the 1st purl fasten it on the last purl of the  preceding circle; leave an interval of about 1-2/5 inch, and repeat from  * till the lace is sufficiently long. The rest is worked in crochet.  Take the fine crochet cotton and work the straight row at the top to  join the patterns together. Crochet 1 double in the 3 first and last  purl of the first and last circle of one pattern, then a sufficient  number of double stitches under the piece of cotton which joins 2  circles. At the place where the circles are drawn together, join the two  pieces of cotton (the beginning and the end) in such a manner that the  top of the lace forms a straight line (see illustration). The 2nd row  consists of 1 treble in every other stitch, 1 chain after every treble.  Then work on the other side of the lace * a row of treble stitches  divided by chain. The treble stitches are worked in the purl stitches of  the circles. Work 1 long treble in the 1st purl left free of the 1st  circle (4th purl of the circle), 3 chain, * 1 treble, 3 chain, 1 treble,  3 chain, 2 treble in the next 2 purl, but cast off the 1st treble only  so far as to keep 2 loops on the needle.

Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40; crochet  cotton No. 60; tatting-pin No. 2.    [Illustration: 41.--Insertion in Tatting and Crochet.]    Begin the tatting with fine cotton and 2 shuttles. Work with the cotton  on one shuttle over the cotton on the other in the following  manner:--Knot the 2 ends of cotton together * 4 times 2 double divided  by a short purl, 3 long purl divided by 1 double; the 1st and 3rd purl  must be three-fifths of an inch long, the 2nd one two-fifths of an inch;  4 times 2 double divided by a short purl, 1 purl two-fifths of an inch  long; repeat from * till the strip of insertion is sufficiently long.  Then work a similar row of tatting, and join the two rows before working  the 1 long purl, by fastening the cotton on the corresponding long purl  of the 1st row, so that the 2 rows are joined closely together, and the  purl stitches of either are turned outwards. At the top and bottom of  the tatting work the 3 following rows of crochet:--* 1 double in the  middle one of the 3 long purl, 8 chain, 1 double in each of the 3  following long purl, 8 chain; repeat from * to the end of the row. 2nd  row. 8 double in each scallop, miss the 3 double stitches of the  preceding row under 3 chain. The 3rd row consists of treble stitches in  every other stitch, 1 chain after every treble. Lastly, the leaves are  worked with thick cotton by filling up the first and last long purl of a  pattern with darning stitch from illustration; the cross stitches  between the two rows of tatting are worked with very fine cotton.           *       *       *       *       *    42.--_Purse in Tatting and Beads_.    Materials: Grey purse-silk; steel beads; scarlet glace silk; a steel  clasp with chain.    This purse is worked in tatting with grey silk and beads. The beads are  threaded on a piece of silk, with which you work over another piece of  the same. Begin each of the second halves of the purse with the circle  in the centre, which consists of 1 purled stitch, 1 purl (all the purl  of this circle are three-tenths of an inch long, and are covered with  six beads, which must be drawn up close together before working the  purl), 12 double divided by 1 purl. Join the stitches into a circle by  knotting together the two ends of the silk.    2nd round: Begin again and work one of the small circles; * 2 double,  draw up one bead after each, 1 double, 1 short purl without beads, 2  double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, fasten the silk on the purl of the  middle circle, so as to let it come between the 3rd and 4th bead of the  6 beads on that purl; 2 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, 1 short  purl, 2 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, join the stitches into a  circle, draw up 2 beads; work a larger circle without fastening the silk  belonging to the smaller one; 3 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, 1  purl with 4 beads, 3 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double; 1 short purl,  3 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, 1 purl with 4 beads, 3 double, 1  bead after each, 1 double; draw up 2 beads close to this large circle  and repeat from *. Each following small circle must be fastened on the  next purl of the circle which forms the centre; they are also fastened  on to each other, instead of working the 1st purl, by fastening the  piece of silk over which you work on the preceding small circle; in the  larger circles, instead of working the 1st purl with 4 beads, the piece  of silk must be fastened on the last purl of the preceding circle, so  that it comes between the 2nd and 3rd beads. At the end of the round,  the ends of the silk are knotted together and fastened off.    [Illustration: 42.--Purse in Tatting and Beads.]    3rd round: * 3 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, 1 short purl, 3  double, 1 bead after each, 1 double fastened on the middle purl of the  1st circle of the preceding round, 3 double, 1 bead after each, 1  double, 1 purl with 2 beads, 3 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double; join  the stitches into a circle, and work at a short distance a 2nd circle; 3  double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, fastened on the last purl of the  just-finished circle of this round, 3 double, 1 bead after each, 1  double fastened on the purl of the preceding round which is between 2  circles; the loop must come between the 2 beads; 3 double, 1 bead after  each; 1 double, 1 purl with 2 beads; 3 double, with 1 bead after each; 1  double; leave a small interval, and repeat 11 times more from *, then  fasten the ends.    When two similar parts have been worked, line them with scarlet glace  silk; fasten them together round the outside, and sew on the clasp. A  round of large circles edges the purse round the outside. The 1st of  these circles consists of 12 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double, 1 purl  with 2 beads, 4 double, 1 bead after each, 1 double. Work a 2nd circle  at a short distance from the 1st: * 4 double, 1 bead after each, 1  double fastened on the purl of the 1st circle of this round; 7 double, 1  bead after each, 1 double, 1 purl with 2 beads, 4 double, 1 bead after  each, 1 double; leave a short interval, and repeat from * till a  sufficient number of circles have been made. The last purl is not worked  in the last circle.           *       *       *       *       *    43.--_Insertion in Tatting and Crochet._    Materials: Messrs. Walter Evans and Co.'s tatting cotton No. 40; crochet  cotton No. 60; tatting-pin No. 3.    [Illustration: 43.--Insertion in Tatting and Crochet.]    This pattern is composed of leaves and flowers. Each of the six leaves  forming a circle is composed of 4 double, 2 purl, separated by 2 double,  4 double (the first and last purl of each leaf must be joined in the  manner before explained), and the centre of each circle forms a wheel.  The flower has four leaves: each leaf consists of 6 double, II purl,  separated each by 1 double, and again 6 double; each leaf is filled up  with button-hole stitches in fine cotton. To form the circle in the  centre of this flower, turn several times the thread which joins the  leaves, and work button-hole stitches round it. Join the flowers and the  circles by knotting them together, or by making 1 purl longer than the  others, and by drawing the next figure through. The crochet border on  each side of the tatting consists of six rows, which are plainly seen in  the illustration.           *       *       *       *       *    44.--_Border in Tatting and Lace Stitch._    Materials: Messrs.
