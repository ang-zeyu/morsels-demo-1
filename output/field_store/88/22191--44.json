The first, who are still  numerous, represent the pre-buddhist Brahmans. They follow, so far as  modern circumstances permit, the ancient ritual and are apparent  polytheists while accepting pantheism as the higher truth. Vishnuites  and Sivaites however are monotheists in the sense that their minor  deities are not essentially different from the saints of Roman and  Eastern Christianity but their monotheism has a pantheistic tinge.  Neither sect denies the existence of the rival god, but each makes its  own deity God, not only in the theistic but in the pantheistic sense and  regards the other deity as merely an influential angel. From time to  time the impropriety of thus specially deifying one aspect of the  universal spirit made itself felt and then Vishnu and Siva were adored  in a composite dual form or, with the addition of Brahma, as a trinity.  But this triad had not great importance and it is a mistake to compare  it with the Christian trinity. Strong as was the tendency to combine and  amalgamate deities, it was mastered in these religions by the desire to  have one definite God, personal inasmuch as he can receive and return  love, although the Indian feeling that God must be all and in all  continually causes the conceptions called Vishnu and Siva to transcend  the limits of personality. This feeling is specially clear in the growth  of Rama and Krishna worship. Both of these deities were originally  ancient heroes, and stories of love and battle cling to them in their  later phases. Yet for their respective devotees each becomes God in  every sense, God as lover of the soul, God as ruler of the universe and  the God of pantheism who is all that exists and can exist.    For some time before and after the beginning of our era, north-western  India witnessed a great fusion of ideas and Indian, Persian and Greek  religion must have been in contact at the university town of Taxila and  many other places. Kashmir too, if somewhat too secluded to be a  meeting-place of nations, was a considerable intellectual centre. We  have not yet sufficient documents to enable us to trace the history and  especially the chronology of thought in these regions but we can say  that certain forms of Vishnuism, Sivaism and Buddhism were all evolved  there and often show features in common. Thus in all we find the idea  that the divine nature is manifested in four forms or five, if we count  the Absolute Godhead as one of them[19].    I shall consider at length below this worship of Vishnu and Siva and  here will merely point out that it differs from the polytheism of the  Smartas. In their higher phases all Hindu religions agree in teaching  some form of pantheism, some laying more and some less stress on the  personal aspect which the deity can assume. But whereas the pantheism of  the Smartas grew out of the feeling that the many gods of tradition must  all be one, the pantheism of the Vishnuites was not evolved out of  pre-buddhist Brahmanism and is due to the conviction that the one God  must be everything. It is Indian but it grew up in some region outside  Brahmanic influence and was accepted by the Brahmans as a permissible  creed, but many legends in the Epics and Puranas indicate that there was  hostility between the old-fashioned Brahmans and the worshippers of  Rama, Krishna and Siva before the alliance was made.    Saktism[20] also was not evolved from ancient Brahmanism but is  different in tone from Vishnuism and Sivaism. Whereas they start from a  movement of thought and spiritual feeling, Saktism has for its basis  certain ancient popular worships. With these it has combined much  philosophy and has attempted to bring its teaching into conformity with  Brahmanism, but yet remains somewhat apart. It worships a goddess of  many names and forms, who is adored with sexual rites and the sacrifice  of animals, or, when the law permits, of men. It asserts even more  plainly than Vishnuism that the teaching of the Vedas is too difficult  for these latter days and even useless, and it offers to its followers  new scriptures called Tantras and new ceremonies as all-sufficient. It  is true that many Hindus object to this sect, which may be compared with  the Mormons in America or the Skoptsy in Russia, and it is numerous only  in certain parts of India (especially Bengal and Assam) but since a  section of Brahmans patronize it, it must be reckoned as a phase of  Hinduism and even at the present day it is an important phase.    There are many cults prevalent in India, though not recognized as sects,  in which the worship of some aboriginal deity is accepted in all its  crudeness without much admixture of philosophy, the only change being  that the deity is described as a form, incarnation or servant of some  well-known god and that Brahmans are connected with this worship. This  habit of absorbing aboriginal superstitions materially lowers the  average level of creed and ritual. An educated Brahman would laugh at  the idea that village superstitions can be taken seriously as religion  but he does not condemn them and, as superstitions, he does not  disbelieve in them. It is chiefly owing to this habit that Hinduism has  spread all over India and its treatment of men and gods is curiously  parallel. Princes like the Manipuris of Assam came under Hindu influence  and were finally recognized as Kshattiyas with an imaginary pedigree,  and on the same principle their deities are recognized as forms of Siva  or Durga. And Siva and Durga themselves were built up in past ages out  of aboriginal beliefs, though the cement holding their figures together  is Indian thought and philosophy, which are able to see in grotesque  rustic godlings an expression of cosmic forces.    Though this is the principal method by which Hinduism has been  propagated, direct missionary effort has not been wanting. For instance  a large part of Assam was converted by the preaching of Vishnuite  teachers in the sixteenth century and the process still continues[21].  But on the whole the missionary spirit characterizes Buddhism rather  than Hinduism. Buddhist missionaries preached their faith, without any  political motive, wherever they could penetrate. But in such countries  as Camboja, Hinduism was primarily the religion of the foreign settlers  and when the political power of the Brahmans began to wane, the people  embraced Buddhism. Outside India it was perhaps only in Java and the  neighbouring islands that Hinduism (with an admixture of Buddhism)  became the religion of the natives.    Many features of Hinduism, its steady though slow conquest of India, its  extraordinary vitality and tenacity in resisting the attacks of  Mohammedanism, and its small power of expansion beyond the seas are  explained by the fact that it is a mode of life as much as a faith. To  be a Hindu it is not sufficient to hold the doctrine of the Upanishads  or any other scriptures: it is necessary to be a member of a Hindu caste  and observe its regulations. It is not quite correct to say that one  must be born a Hindu, since Hinduism has grown by gradually hinduizing  the wilder tribes of India and the process still continues. But a  convert cannot enter the fold by any simple ceremony like baptism. The  community to which he belongs must adopt Hindu usages and then it will  be recognized as a caste, at first of very low standing but in a few  generations it may rise in the general esteem. A Hindu is bound to his  religion by almost the same ties that bind him to his family. Hence the  strength of Hinduism in India. But such ties are hard to knit and  Hinduism has no chance of spreading abroad unless there is a large  colony of Hindus surrounded by an appreciative and imitative  population[22].    In the contest between Hinduism and Buddhism the former owed the victory  which it obtained in India, though not in other lands, to this  assimilative social influence. The struggle continued from the fourth to  the ninth century, after which Buddhism was clearly defeated and  survived only in special localities. Its final disappearance was due to  the destruction of its remaining monasteries by Moslem invaders but this  blow was fatal only because Buddhism was concentrated in its monkhood.  Innumerable Hindu temples were destroyed, yet Hinduism was at no time in  danger of extinction.    The Hindu reaction against Buddhism became apparent under the Gupta  dynasty but Mahayanism in its use of Sanskrit and its worship of  Bodhisattvas shows the beginnings of the same movement. The danger for  Buddhism was not persecution but tolerance and obliteration of  differences. The Guptas were not bigots. It was probably in their time  that the oldest Puranas, the laws of Manu and the Mahabharata received  their final form. These are on the whole text-books of Smarta Hinduism  and two Gupta monarchs celebrated the horse sacrifice. But the  Mahabharata contains several episodes which justify the exclusive  worship of either Vishnu or Siva, and the architecture of the Guptas  suggests that they were Vishnuites. They also bestowed favours on  Buddhism which was not yet decadent, for Vasubandhu and Asanga, who  probably lived in the fourth century, were constructive thinkers. It is  true that their additions were of the dangerous kind which render an  edifice top-heavy but their works show vitality and had a wide  influence[23]. The very name of Asanga's philosophy--Yogacarya--indicates  its affinity to Brahmanic thought, as do his doctrines of Alayavijnana  and Bodhi, which permit him to express in Buddhist language the idea  that the soul may be illumined by the deity. In some cases Hinduism, in  others Buddhism, may have played the receptive part but the general  result--namely the diminution of differences between the two--was always  the same.

These Berber wars had an important influence on the future of Spain;  for, since the Berbers had settled on all the Northern and Western  marches, when they were decimated by civil war, and many of the  survivors compelled to return to Africa,[2] owing to the famine which  afflicted the country from 750 to 755, the frontiers of the Arab  dominion were left practically denuded of defenders,[3] and the  Christians at once advanced their boundaries to the Douro, leaving  however a strip of desert land as a barrier between them and the  Moslems. This debateable land they did not occupy till fifty years  later.[4]        [1] _I.e._, Jordan. See Al Makkari, i. 356, De Gayangos' note.        [2] Dozy, iii. 24.

Abdurrahman Ibn Muawiyah landed in Spain with 750 Berber horsemen in May  756. The Khalifate of Cordova may be said to begin with this date,  though it was many years before the new sultan had settled his power on  a firm basis, or was recognised as ruler by the whole of Moslem Spain.    During the forty-five years of civil warfare which intervened between  the invasion of Tarik and the landing of Abdurrahman, we have very  little knowledge of what the Christians were doing. The Arab historians  are too busy recounting the feuds of their own tribes to pay any  particular attention to the subject Christians. But we may gather that  the latter were, on the whole, fairly content with their new  servitude.[1] The Moslems were not very anxious to proselytize, as the  conversion of the Spaniards meant a serious diminution of the  tribute.[2] Those Christians who did apostatize--and we may believe that  they were chiefly slaves--at once took up a position of legal, though  not social, equality with the other Moslems. It is no wonder that the  slaves became Mohammedans, for, apart from their hatred for their  masters, and the obvious temporal advantage of embracing Islam, the  majority of them knew nothing at all about Christianity.[3] The ranks of  the converts were recruited from time to time by those who went over to  Islam to avoid paying the poll-tax, or even to escape the payment of  some penalty inflicted by the Christian courts.[4] One thing is  noticeable. In the early years of the conquest there was none of that  bitterness displayed between the adherents of the rival creeds, to which  we are so accustomed in later times. Isidore of Beja, the only  contemporary Christian authority, though he rhapsodizes about the  devastations committed by the conquerors, and complains of enormous  tributes exacted, yet speaks more fairly about the Moslems[5] than any  other Spanish writer before the fourteenth century. \"If he hates the  conquerors,\" says Dozy,[6] \"he hates them rather as men of another race  than of another creed;\" and the marriage of Abdulaziz and Egilona  awakens in his mind no sentiment of horror.        [1] This was not so when the fierce Almoravides and fiercer      Almohades overran Spain in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.      See Freeman's \"Saracens,\" p. 168.        [2] As happened in Egypt under Amru. See Cardonne, i. p. 168,      and Gibbon, vi. p. 370.        [3] Dozy, ii. 45, quotes a passage from Pedraca, \"Histor.      Eccles. of Granada\" (1638), in which the author points out that      even in his day the \"old Christians\" of Central Spain were so      wholly ignorant of all Christian doctrines that they might be      expected to renounce Christianity with the utmost ease if again      subjected to the Moors.        [4] Samson, \"Apolog.,\" ii. cc. 3, 5.        [5] Speaking of Omar, the second Khalif of that name, Isidore,      sec. 46, says, \"Tanta ei sanctimonia ascribitur quanta nulli      unquam ex Arabum gente.\"        [6] Dozy, ii. p. 42.    On the whole the condition of the mass of the people, Christian or  renegade, was certainly preferable to their state before the  conquest.[1] Those serfs who remained Christian, if they worked on State  lands, payed one-third of the produce to the State; if on private lands,  four-fifths to their Arab owners.[2] The free Christians retained their  goods, and could even alienate their lands. They paid a graduated tax  varying from thirteen pounds to three guineas.[3] In all probability the  Christians under Moslem rule were not worse off than their  coreligionists in Galicia and Leon. A signal proof of this is afforded  by the fact that, in spite of the distracted state of the country, which  would seem to hold out a great hope of success, we hear of no attempts  at revolt on the part of the subjected Christians in the eighth century,  except at Beja, where the Christians seem to have been led away by the  ambition of an Arab chief.[4] They were even somewhat indifferent to the  cause of their coreligionists in the North, and the attempts which  Pelayo and his successors made to induce them to rise in concert with  their brethren met with but scant success.[5]        [1] See especially Conde, Pref. p. vi.        [2] Dozy, ii. 39.        [3] Dozy, ii. 40.        [4] Dozy, ii. 42.        [5] Cardonne, i. 106.    There can be no doubt, however, that the good understanding, which at  first existed between the Moslems and their Christian subjects,  gradually gave place to a very different state of things, owing in no  small degree to the free Christians in the North, whose presence on  their borders was a continual menace to the Moslem dominion, and a  perpetual incentive to the subject Christians to rise and assert their  freedom.    Our purpose now is to trace out, so far as the scanty indications  scattered in the writers of the time will allow, the relations that  existed between the two religions during the 275 years of the Khalifate,  and the influence which these relations had upon the development of the  one and the other. It will be agreeable to the natural arrangement to  take the former question first.    With a view to the better understanding of the position of Christianity  and Mohammedanism at the very beginning of our inquiry, we have thought  it advisable to point out in a preliminary sketch the development of  Christianity in Spain previous to the period when the Moslems, fresh  from their native deserts of Arabia and Africa, bearing the sword in one  hand and the Koran in the other, possessed themselves of one of the  fairest provinces of Christendom. This having been already done, we can  at once proceed to investigate the mutual relations of Christianity and  Mohammedanism in Spain during the 300 years of the Khalifate of Cordova.    It was in fulfilment of a supposed prophecy of Mohammed's, and in  obedience to the precepts of the Koran itself, that the Arabs, having  overrun Syria, Egypt, and Africa, passed over into Spain, and the war  from the very first took the character of a jehad, or religious war--a  character which it retained with the ever-increasing fanaticism of the  combatants until every Mohammedan had been forced to abjure his creed,  or been driven out of Spain. But, as we have seen, the conquest itself  was singularly free from any outbursts of religious frenzy; though of  course there must have been many Christians, who laid down their lives  in defence of all that was near and dear to them, in defence of their  wives and their children, their homes and their country, their religion  and their honour. One such instance at least has been recorded by the  Arab historians,[1] when the Governor, and 400 of the garrison, of  Cordova, after three months' siege in the church of St George, chose  rather to be burnt in their hold than surrender upon condition either of  embracing Islam, or paying tribute.    Omitting the story of the fabulous martyr Nicolaus, as being a tissue of  errors and absurdities,[2] the first martyr properly so called was a  certain bishop, named Anambad, who was put to death by Othman ibn abi  Nesah (727-728)--a governor guilty of shedding much Christian blood, if  Isidore is to be believed.[3]        [1] Al Makkari, i. 279, says: \"This was the cause of the spot      being called ever since the Kenisatu-l-haraki (the church of      the burnt), as likewise of the great veneration in which it has      always been held by the Christians, on account of the courage      and endurance displayed in the cause of their religion by those      who died in it.\"        [2] Florez, \"Espana Sagr,\" xiv. 392.        [3] Isidore, sec. 58, \"Munuza quia a sanguine Christianorum,      quen ibidem innocentem fuderat, nimium erat crapulatus, et      Anabadi, illustris episcopi,... quem ipse cremaverat, valde      exhaustus,\" etc. It is doubtful who this Munuza was, but      probably Othman ibn abi Nesah, Governor of Spain.    Fifteen years later a Christian named Peter, pursuing very much the same  tactics as the pseudo-martyrs in the next century, brought about his  own condemnation and death. He held a responsible post under Government,  that of receiver of public imposts, and seems to have stood on terms of  friendship with many of the Arab nobles. Perhaps he had been rather lax  in his religious observances, or even disguised his Christianity from  motives of interest. However, he fell sick, and thinking that his life  was near its end, he called together his Moslem friends, and thanking  them for showing their concern for him by coming, he proceeded, \"But I  desire you to be witnesses of this my last will. Whosoever believeth not  on the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the Consubstantial Trinity,  is blind in heart, and deserveth eternal punishment, as also doth  Mohammed, your false prophet, the forerunner of Antichrist. Renounce,  therefore, these fables, I conjure you this day, and let heaven and  earth witness between us.\" Though greatly incensed, as was natural, the"]]]
