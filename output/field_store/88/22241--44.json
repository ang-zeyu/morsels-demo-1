[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#7)"],[1," from the 15 days' passage or thereabout, of  the earliest Atlantic steamers, we had got down in the days of the  Scotia to about 9 days; in the Britannic to 81/4 days, and, at the  present time, we have got to 61/4 days, with seven ships afloat that  have done the passage under seven days, and capable of making their  average passages range between 61/2 and 71/4 days.    Ranged in order of gross tonnage, these eight vessels stand as  follows:      TABLE II.      1. City of Rome.    8,144    2. Oregon.          7,375    3. Aurania.         7,269    4. Servia.          7,212    5. Umbria.          7,129    6. Etruria.         7,100    7. Alaska.          6,586    8. America.         5,528    Here the America shows to advantage, for while being eighth in size  she is fourth in point of speed, and from what the author can learn,  although he had no authenticated details on the subject, he believed  she is economical in coal consumption. He might perhaps be permitted  to say that one of the most difficult subjects in connection with the  propulsion of ships on which to get absolutely accurate data is that  of coal consumption. The records of six to eight hours' trials for the  purpose of ascertaining the coal consumption are absolutely worthless,  as all shipbuilders and engineers know, and so far as English ships  are concerned they are never attempted. Foreign owners frequently  stipulate for such trials in their contracts with English  shipbuilders, and get wonderfully economical results on paper, but the  fact that the trials only extend over a few hours renders them  valueless, however carefully the coal may be weighed during that  period. An authentic record of the absolute quantity of coal consumed,  say by each of the eight fastest Atlantic liners, together with their  average indicated horse power on the voyage, for a series of voyages,  would be extremely valuable.    He gave, in Table III., the consumption per indicated horse power per  hour for a number of ships. This table affords valuable data, for it  gives, in addition to the dimensions, the moulded draught of water,  the midship area, the displacement, the indicated horse power, the  speed on trial, the coefficients for the lines both from the block or  parallelopipedon, and also from the midship section prism, together  with the length and angle of entrance obtained by Kirk's rule, the  Admiralty displacement coefficient, together with the coal consumption  per day and per indicated horse power per hour.    [Illustration: Fig. 3--OREGON.]    This table, as will be seen, contains some of the most important of  the Atlantic liners, and also a number of other typical ships, which  will add a variety to its interest and a value to it. The coefficient,  which is contained in the thirteenth column of the table, viz.:            Dis 2/3 x speed cubed      -------------------------      I.H.P. x sqrt(entrance.)               ---------------                       10    generally comes out for ships of similar type more nearly a constant  in the true sense of the word than the corresponding Admiralty  constant. As an example, we have the curves of resistance and horse  power for the City of Rome and the Normandie, a large vessel of 6,000  tons, which the Barrow Company built for the Compagnie Generale  Transatlantique, in which the coefficient of fineness and the form of  the lines pretty closely resemble each other below water; and if we  take from the curves the corresponding speeds and horse powers, and  work out the constants by the two systems, we have at 14 knots the  Admiralty constant for the City of Rome 322.2, and for the Normandie  304.8; and taking for a modified form of constant, the City of Rome  gives 253.7 and the Normandie 251.9, which, as will be seen, are much  closer together. Similarly, at 15 knots the Admiralty constant for the  City of Rome is 310, and for the Normandie 295.2, while a modified  constant comes out for the former at 245, and for the latter 244,  again agreeing almost identically. The same at 16 knots, for the City  of Rome the Admiralty constant comes out 297.6, and for the Normandie  282.8, while a modified constant comes out for the two ships 234.4 and  233.7 respectively, again showing marked agreement. It may be  mentioned that in these two ships the engines are of a similar type,  being three-crank tandem engines, and the propellers have in both  pitch and surface practically the same proportions to the power and  speed. The value of these modified constants will probably be found to  increase as the speeds increase up to the limit and beyond that point  at which wave resistance becomes an important factor.

It thus became essential to establish some system of regular relief in  the trenches, and I have used the infantry of the Sixth Division for  this purpose with good results. The relieved brigades were brought back  alternately south of the river and, with the artillery of the Sixth  Division, formed a general reserve on which I could rely in case of  necessity.    The cavalry has rendered most efficient and ready help in the trenches,  and have done all they possibly could to lighten the arduous and trying  task which has of necessity fallen to the lot of the infantry.    On the evening of the 19th and throughout the 20th the enemy again  commenced to show considerable activity. On the former night a severe  counter-attack on the Third Division was repulsed with considerable  loss, and from early on Sunday morning various hostile attempts were  made on the trenches of the First Division. During the day the enemy  suffered another severe repulse in front of the Second Division, losing  heavily in the attempt. In the course of the afternoon the enemy made  desperate attempts against the trenches all along the front of the First  Corps, but with similar results.    After dark the enemy again attacked the Second Division, only to be  again driven back.    Our losses on these two days were considerable, but the number, as  obtained, of the enemy's killed and wounded vastly exceeded them.    As the troops of the First Army Corps were much exhausted by this  continual fighting, I reinforced Sir Douglas Haig with a brigade from  the reserve, and called upon the First Cavalry Division to assist them.    On the night of the 21st another violent counter-attack was repulsed by  the Third Division, the enemy losing heavily.    On the 23d the four 6-inch howitzer batteries, which I had asked to be  sent from home, arrived. Two batteries were handed over to the Second  Corps and two to the First Corps. They were brought into action on the  24th with very good results.    Our experiences in this campaign seem to point to the employment of more  heavy guns of a larger calibre in great battles which last for several  days, during which time powerful intrenching work on both sides can be  carried out. These batteries were used with considerable effect on the  24th and the following days.    8. On the 23d the action of Gen. de Castelnau's army on the allied left  developed considerably, and apparently withdrew considerable forces of  the enemy away from the centre and east. I am not aware whether it was  due to this cause or not, but until the 26th it appeared as though the  enemy's opposition in our front was weakening. On that day, however, a  very marked renewal of activity commenced. A constant and vigorous  artillery bombardment was maintained all day, and the Germans in front  of the First Division were observed to be \"sapping\" up to our lines and  trying to establish new trenches. Renewed counter-attacks were delivered  and beaten off during the course of the day, and in the afternoon a  well-timed attack by the First Division stopped the enemy's intrenching  work.    During the night of the 27th-28th the enemy again made the most  determined attempts to capture the trenches of the First Division, but  without the slightest success.    Similar attacks were reported during these three days all along the line  of the allied front, and it is certain that the enemy then made one last  great effort to establish ascendency. He was, however, unsuccessful  everywhere, and is reported to have suffered heavy losses. The same  futile attempts were made all along our front up to the evening of the  28th, when they died away, and have not since been renewed.    On former occasions I have brought to your Lordship's notice the  valuable services performed during this campaign by the Royal Artillery.    Throughout the battle of the Aisne they have displayed the same skill,  endurance, and tenacity, and I deeply appreciate the work they have  done.    Sir David Henderson and the Royal Flying Corps under his command have  again proved their incalculable value. Great strides have been made in  the development of the use of aircraft in the tactical sphere by  establishing effective communication between aircraft and units in  action.    It is difficult to describe adequately and accurately the great strain  to which officers and men were subjected almost every hour of the day  and night throughout this battle.    [Illustration: Map 10.--Sept. 15 to 28. This map shows the intrenched  positions of the Germans, many of which the Allies took with great loss  to the Germans.]    I have described above the severe character of the artillery fire which  was directed from morning till night not only upon the trenches, but  over the whole surface of the ground occupied by our forces. It was not  until a few days before the position was evacuated that the heavy guns  were removed and the fire slackened. Attack and counter-attack occurred  at all hours of the night and day throughout the whole position,  demanding extreme vigilance, and permitting only a minimum of rest.    The fact that between Sept. 12 to the date of this dispatch the total  numbers of killed, wounded, and missing reached the figures amounting to  561 officers, 12,980 men, proves the severity of the struggle.    The tax on the endurance of the troops was further increased by the  heavy rain and cold which prevailed for some ten or twelve days of this  trying time.    The battle of the Aisne has once more demonstrated the splendid spirit,  gallantry, and devotion which animates the officers and men of his  Majesty's forces.    With reference to the last paragraph of my dispatch of Sept. 7, I append  the names of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men brought  forward for special mention by army corps commanders and heads of  departments for services rendered from the commencement of the campaign  up to the present date.    I entirely agree with these recommendations and beg to submit them for  your Lordship's consideration.    I further wish to bring forward the names of the following officers who  have rendered valuable service: Gen. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien and Lieut.  Gen. Sir Douglas Haig (commanding First and Second Corps, respectively)  I have already mentioned in the present and former dispatches for  particularly marked and distinguished service in critical situations.    Since the commencement of the campaign they have carried out all my  orders [Transcriber: original 'orders.'] and instructions with the  utmost ability.    Lieut. Gen. W.P. Pulteney took over the command of the Third Corps just  before the commencement of the battle of the Marne. Throughout the  subsequent operations he showed himself to be a most capable commander  in the field, and has rendered very valuable services.    Major Gen. E.H.H. Allenby and Major Gen. H. De La P. Gough have proved  themselves to be cavalry leaders of a high order, and I am deeply  indebted to them. The undoubted moral superiority which our cavalry has  obtained over that of the enemy has been due to the skill with which  they have turned to the best account the qualities inherent in the  splendid troops they command.    In my dispatch of the 7th September I mentioned the name of Brig. Gen.  Sir David Henderson and his valuable work in command of the Royal Flying  Corps; and I have once more to express my deep appreciation of the help  he has since rendered me.    Lieut. Gen. Sir Archibald Murray has continued to render me invaluable  help as Chief of the Staff; and in his arduous and responsible duties he  has been ably assisted by Major Gen. Henry Wilson, Sub-Chief.    Lieut. Gen. Sir Nevil Macready and Lieut. Gen. Sir William Robertson  have continued to perform excellent service as Adjutant General and  Quartermaster General, respectively.    The Director of Army Signals, Lieut. Col. J.S. Fowler, has materially  assisted the operations by the skill and energy which he has displayed  in the working of the important department over which he presides.    My Military Secretary, Brig. Gen. the Hon. W. Lambton, has performed his  arduous and difficult duties with much zeal and great efficiency.    I am anxious also to bring to your Lordship's notice the following names  of officers of my personal staff, who throughout these arduous  operations have shown untiring zeal and energy in the performance of  their duties:        _Aides de Camp._        Lieut. Col. Stanley Barry.      Lieut. Col. Lord Brooke.      Major Fitzgerald Watt.        _Extra Aide de Camp._        Capt. the Hon. F.E. Guest.        _Private Secretary._        Lieut. Col. Brindsley Fitzgerald.    Major his Royal Highness Prince Arthur of Connaught, K.G., joined my  staff as Aide de Camp on the 14th September.    His Royal Highness's intimate knowledge of languages enabled me to  employ him with great advantage on confidential missions of some  importance, and his services have proved of considerable value.    I cannot close this dispatch without informing your Lordship of the  valuable services rendered by the Chief of the French Military Mission  at my headquarters, Col. Victor Huguet of the French Artillery. He has  displayed tact and judgment of a high order in many difficult  situations, and has rendered conspicuous service to the allied cause. I  have the honor to be, your Lordship's most obedient servant,    J.D.P. French, Field Marshal,  _Commanding in Chief the British Army in the Field._          IV.    *The Battle in Flanders.*    [Official Abstract of Report for The Associated Press.]      LONDON, Nov. 29.--A report from Field Marshal Sir John French covering  the period of the battle in Flanders and the days immediately preceding  it, issued today by the Official Press Bureau, shows that this battle  was brought about, first, by the Allies' attempts to outflank the  Germans, who countered, and then by the Allies' plans to"]]]
