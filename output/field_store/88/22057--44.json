The man in his window  likewise recognized it, and uttering a groan, came immediately out and  joined us. What it was, I also learned in a few minutes. For we found  a house where the people made no sign at either our fiddlers or our  knocking. And then the infernal machine was set to work. Its parts  seemed to be no more than an empty keg and a plank. Some citizen  informed me that I should soon have a new idea of noise; and I nerved  myself for something severe in the way of gunpowder. But the Virginian  and the proprietor now sat on the ground holding the keg braced, and two  others got down apparently to play see-saw over the top of it with the  plank. But the keg and plank had been rubbed with rosin, and they drew  the plank back and forth over the keg. Do you know the sound made in  a narrow street by a dray loaded with strips of iron? That noise is a  lullaby compared with the staggering, blinding bellow which rose from  the keg. If you were to try it in your native town, you would not merely  be arrested, you would be hanged, and everybody would be glad, and the  clergyman would not bury you. My head, my teeth, the whole system of my  bones leaped and chattered at the din, and out of the house like drops  squirted from a lemon came a man and his wife. No time was given them.  They were swept along with the rest; and having been routed from their  own bed, they now became most furious in assailing the remaining homes  of Medicine Bow. Everybody was to come out. Many were now riding horses  at top speed out into the plains and back, while the procession of the  plank and keg continued its work, and the fiddlers played incessantly.    Suddenly there was a quiet. I did not see who brought the message; but  the word ran among us that there was a woman--the engineer's woman  down by the water-tank--very sick. The doctor had been to see her from  Laramie. Everybody liked the engineer. Plank and keg were heard no more.  The horsemen found it out and restrained their gambols. Medicine Bow  went gradually home. I saw doors shutting, and lights go out; I saw  a late few reassemble at the card tables, and the drummers gathered  themselves together for sleep; the proprietor of the store (you could  not see a more respectable-looking person) hoped that I would be  comfortable on the quilts; and I heard Steve urging the Virginian to  take one more glass.    \"We've not met for so long,\" he said.    But the Virginian, the black-headed guy who had set all this nonsense  going, said No to Steve. \"I have got to stay responsible,\" was his  excuse to his friend. And the friend looked at me. Therefore I surmised  that the Judge's trustworthy man found me an embarrassment to his  holiday. But if he did, he never showed it to me. He had been sent to  meet a stranger and drive him to Sunk Creek in safety, and this charge  he would allow no temptation to imperil. He nodded good night to me. \"If  there's anything I can do for yu', you'll tell me.\"    I thanked him. \"What a pleasant evening!\" I added.    \"I'm glad yu' found it so.\"    Again his manner put a bar to my approaches. Even though I had seen  him wildly disporting himself, those were matters which he chose not to  discuss with me.    Medicine Bow was quiet as I went my way to my quilts. So still, that  through the air the deep whistles of the freight trains came from below  the horizon across great miles of silence. I passed cow-boys, whom half  an hour before I had seen prancing and roaring, now rolled in their  blankets beneath the open and shining night.    \"What world am I in?\" I said aloud. \"Does this same planet hold Fifth  Avenue?\"    And I went to sleep, pondering over my native land.          IV. DEEP INTO CATTLE LAND      Morning had been for some while astir in Medicine Bow before I left my  quilts. The new day and its doings began around me in the store, chiefly  at the grocery counter. Dry-goods were not in great request. The early  rising cow-boys were off again to their work; and those to whom their  night's holiday had left any dollars were spending these for tobacco, or  cartridges, or canned provisions for the journey to their distant  camps. Sardines were called for, and potted chicken, and devilled ham:  a sophisticated nourishment, at first sight, for these sons of the  sage-brush. But portable ready-made food plays of necessity a great part  in the opening of a new country. These picnic pots and cans were the  first of her trophies that Civilization dropped upon Wyoming's virgin  soil. The cow-boy is now gone to worlds invisible; the wind has blown  away the white ashes of his camp-fires; but the empty sardine box lies  rusting over the face of the Western earth.    So through my eyes half closed I watched the sale of these tins, and  grew familiar with the ham's inevitable trademark--that label with the  devil and his horns and hoofs and tail very pronounced, all colored a  sultry prodigious scarlet. And when each horseman had made his purchase,  he would trail his spurs over the floor, and presently the sound of his  horse's hoofs would be the last of him. Through my dozing attention came  various fragments of talk, and sometimes useful bits of knowledge. For  instance, I learned the true value of tomatoes in this country. One  fellow was buying two cans of them.    \"Meadow Creek dry already?\" commented the proprietor.    \"Been dry ten days,\" the young cow-boy informed him. And it appeared  that along the road he was going, water would not be reached much before  sundown, because this Meadow Creek had ceased to run. His tomatoes were  for drink. And thus they have refreshed me many times since.    \"No beer?\" suggested the proprietor.    The boy made a shuddering face. \"Don't say its name to me!\" he  exclaimed. \"I couldn't hold my breakfast down.\" He rang his silver money  upon the counter. \"I've swore off for three months,\" he stated. \"I'm  going to be as pure as the snow!\" And away he went jingling out of the  door, to ride seventy-five miles. Three more months of hard, unsheltered  work, and he would ride into town again, with his adolescent blood  crying aloud for its own.    \"I'm obliged,\" said a new voice, rousing me from a new doze. \"She's  easier this morning, since the medicine.\" This was the engineer, whose  sick wife had brought a hush over Medicine Bow's rioting. \"I'll give her  them flowers soon as she wakes,\" he added.    \"Flowers?\" repeated the proprietor.    \"You didn't leave that bunch at our door?\"    \"Wish I'd thought to do it.\"    \"She likes to see flowers,\" said the engineer. And he walked out slowly,  with his thanks unachieved. He returned at once with the Virginian; for  in the band of the Virginian's hat were two or three blossoms.    \"It don't need mentioning,\" the Southerner was saying, embarrassed by  any expression of thanks. \"If we had knowed last night--\"    \"You didn't disturb her any,\" broke in the engineer. \"She's easier this  morning. I'll tell her about them flowers.\"    \"Why, it don't need mentioning,\" the Virginian again protested, almost  crossly. \"The little things looked kind o' fresh, and I just picked  them.\" His eye now fell upon me, where I lay upon the counter. \"I reckon  breakfast will be getting through,\" he remarked.    I was soon at the wash trough. It was only half-past six, but many had  been before me,--one glance at the roller-towel told me that. I was  afraid to ask the landlady for a clean one, and so I found a fresh  handkerchief, and accomplished a sparing toilet. In the midst of this  the drummers joined me, one by one, and they used the degraded towel  without hesitation. In a way they had the best of me; filth was nothing  to them.    The latest risers in Medicine Bow, we sat at breakfast together; and  they essayed some light familiarities with the landlady. But these  experiments were failures. Her eyes did not see, nor did her ears  hear them. She brought the coffee and the bacon with a sedateness that  propriety itself could scarce have surpassed. Yet impropriety lurked  noiselessly all over her. You could not have specified how; it was  interblended with her sum total. Silence was her apparent habit and her  weapon; but the American drummer found that she could speak to the point  when need came for this. During the meal he had praised her golden  hair. It was golden indeed, and worth a high compliment; but his kind  displeased her. She had let it pass, however, with no more than a cool  stare. But on taking his leave, when he came to pay for the meal, he  pushed it too far.    \"Pity this must be our last,\" he said; and as it brought no answer,  \"Ever travel?\" he inquired. \"Where I go, there's room for a pair of us.\"    \"Then you'd better find another jackass,\" she replied quietly.    I was glad that I had not asked for a clean towel.    From the commercial travellers I now separated myself, and wandered  alone in pleasurable aimlessness. It was seven o'clock. Medicine  Bow stood voiceless and unpeopled. The cow-boys had melted away. The  inhabitants were indoors, pursuing the business or the idleness of the  forenoon. Visible motion there was none. No shell upon the dry sands  could lie more lifeless than Medicine Bow. Looking in at the store,  I saw the proprietor sitting with his pipe extinct. Looking in at the  saloon, I saw the dealer dealing dumbly to himself. Up in the sky there  was not a cloud nor a bird, and on the earth the lightest straw  lay becalmed. Once I saw the Virginian at an open door, where the  golden-haired landlady stood talking with him. Sometimes I strolled in  the town, and sometimes out on the plain I lay down with my day dreams  in the sagebrush. Pale herds of antelope were in the distance, and near  by the demure prairie-dogs sat up and scrutinized me.

The tales of their  adventures and sufferings the author speaks of as more marvelous than  anything he had ever heard or read since his boyish acquaintance with  Robinson Crusoe and Ledyard. Some had come by the way of Santa Fe,  along the savage Gila hills--some had crossed the Great Desert, and  taken the road from El Paso to Sonora--some had passed through Mexico,  and, after beating about for months in the Pacific, had run into San  Deigo and abandoned their vessel--some had landed weary with a seven  months' voyage round Cape Horn--while others had wandered on foot  from Cape St. Lucas to San Deigo, over frightful deserts and rugged  mountains, a distance of nearly fifteen hundred miles, as they were  obliged to travel.    The Gila emigrants spoke with horror of the Great Desert west of the  Colorado--a land of drought and desolation--vast salt plains and hills  of drifting sand; the trails which they followed sown white with bones  of man and beast. Unburied corpses of emigrants and carcasses of mules  who had preceded them, making the hot air foul and loathsome. Wo to  the weak and faltering in such a journey! They were left alone to die  on the burning sands.    On the Sonora route, one of the party fell sick, and rode on behind  his companions, unable to keep pace with them for several days, yet  always arriving in camp a few hours later. At last he was missing.  Four days after, a negro, alone and on foot, came into camp and told  them that many miles back a man lying by the road had begged a little  water of him, and urged him to hurry on and bring assistance. The next  morning a company of Mexicans came up, and brought word that the man  was dying. But his old companions hesitated to go to his relief. The  negro thereupon retraced his steps over the desert, and reached the  sufferer just as he expired. He lifted him in his arms; the poor  fellow strove to speak to his benefactor, and died in the effort.  His mule, tied to a cactus, was already dead of hunger at his side.  A picture commemorating such a scene, and the heroic humanity of  the negro, would better adorn a panel of the Capitol, than any  battle-piece which was ever painted.    There is a graphic account of the author's first impressions of San  Francisco. \"A furious wind was blowing down through a gap in the  hills, filling the streets with dust. On every side stood buildings  of all kinds, began or half-finished, with canvas sheds open in front  and covered with all kinds of signs, in all languages. Great piles of  merchandise were in the open air, for lack of storehouses. The streets  were full of people of as diverse and bizarre a character as their  dwellings: Yankees of every possible variety, native Californians  in serapes and sombreros, Chilians, Sonorians, Kanakas from Hawaii,  Chinese with long tails, Malays armed with everlasting creeses, and  others, in their bearded and embrowned visages, it was impossible to  recognize any especial nationality.\" \"San Francisco by day and night\"  is the title of one of the best chapters in the book.    Our author made a foot journey to Monterey during the sitting of the  Convention which formed the State Constitution. He gives a pleasing  account of the refined and polite society of this ancient Californian  town; and makes particular mention of Dona Augusta Ximeno, a sister  of one of the Californian delegates to the Convention, Don Pablo de  la Guerra, as a woman whose nobility of character, native vigor and  activity of intellect, and instinctive refinement and winning grace  of manner, would have given her a complete supremacy in society, had  her lot been cast in Europe or the United States. Her house was the  favorite resort of the leading members of the Convention, American  and Californian. She was thoroughly versed in Spanish literature, and  her remarks on the various authors were just and elegant. She was,  besides, a fine rider, and could throw the lariat with skill, and  possesses all those bold and daring qualities which are so fascinating  when softened and made graceful by true feminine delicacy.    He describes the native Californians as physically and morally  superior to the Mexicans of other States. They are, as a class,  finely built, with fresh, clear complexions. The educated class very  generally are and appear well satisfied with the change of affairs,  but the majority still look with jealousy on the new comers, and are  not pleased with the new customs and new laws. The Californians in the  Convention seemed every way worthy of their position. General Vallejo  is a man of middle years, tall, and of commanding presence--with the  grave and dignified expression of the old Castilian race. With him  were Cavarrubias, the old Secretary of the Government, Pico, Carvillo,  Pedrorena, La Guerra, and a half-blood Indian member, Dominguez,  who, together with many of the most respectable and wealthy citizens  of California, is now excluded from voting by a clause of the  Constitution, which denies that privilege to Indians and negroes. This  unjust exception--a blot on an otherwise admirable Constitution--was  adopted after a warm debate, and against fierce opposition. The  attempt to prohibit free people of color from inhabiting the State  failed by a large majority. _The clause prohibiting slavery passed by  the vote of every member._    The account of the close of the Convention is sufficiently amusing.  The members met and adjourned, after a brief session, and their hall  was immediately cleared of forum, seats, and tables, and decorated  with pine boughs and oak garlands. At eight in the evening, it  was thrown open for a ball. Sixty or seventy ladies, and as many  gentlemen, were present. Dark-eyed daughters of Monterey and Los  Angelos and Santa Barbara, with Indian and Spanish complexions,  contrasted with the fairer bloom of belles from the Atlantic side of  the Nevada. There was as great a variety of costume as of complexion.  Several American officers were there in their uniform. In one group  might be seen Captain Sutter's soldierly moustache and clear blue eye;  in another, the erect figure and quiet, dignified bearing of Vallejo.  Don Pablo de la Guerra, with his handsome aristocratic features, was  the floor manager, and gallantly discharged his office. Conspicuous  among the native members, were Don Miguel Pedrorena and Jacinto  Rodriguez, both polished and popular gentlemen. Dominguez. the Indian,  took no part in the dance, but evidently enjoyed the scene as much  as any one present. The most interesting figure was that of the Padre  Ramirez, who, in his clerical cassock, looked until a late hour. \"If  the strongest advocate of priestly decorum had been present,\" says our  author, \"he could not have found it in his heart to grudge the good  old padre the pleasure which beamed in his honest countenance.\"    The next day the Convention met for the last time. The parchment  sheet, with the engrossed Constitution, was laid upon the table, and  the members commenced affixing their names. Then the American colors  were run up the flagstaff in front of the Hall, and the guns of the  fort responded to the signal. The great work was done. California, so  far as it depended on herself, was a State of the great Confederacy.  All were excited. Captain Sutter leaped up from his seat, and swung  his arm over his head. \"Gentlemen!\" he cried, \"this is the happiest  hour of my life. It makes me glad to hear the cannon. This is a great  day for California!\" Recollecting himself, he sat down, the tears  streaming from his eyes. His brother members cheered. As the signing  went on, gun followed gun from the fort. At last the _thirty-first_  was echoed back from the hills. \"That's for California!\" shouted a  member, and three times three cheers were given by the members. An  English vessel caught the enthusiasm, and sent to the breeze the  American flag from her mast-head. The day was beautiful; all faces  looked bright and happy under the glorious sunset, \"Were I a believer  in omens,\" writes our tourist on the spot, \"I would augur from the  tranquil beauty of the evening--from the clear sky and sunset hues of  the bay--more than all, from the joyous expression of every face--a  glorious and happy career for the 'STATE OF CALIFORNIA!'\"    Our author visited several of the most important \"diggings,\" and his  account of their location, productiveness, &c., does not materially  differ from the descriptions which have become familiar to all our  readers. It is evident from his statements, that with good health  and perseverance, any reasonable expectation of wealth on the part of  the miners may be realized, in a few months or years, according to  the richness of the \"diggings,\" or the ease with which they may be  worked. What, however, has interested us more than the gold-product  of California, is the confirmation which our traveler gives to the  statements of Fremont and King, relative to the richness of its soil,  and its great agricultural capacities. The valleys of the Sacramento  and San Joaquim alone are capable of supporting a population of  two millions, if carefully cultivated. The deep, black, porous soil  produces the important cereal grains, although on the seaboard the air  is too cool for the ripening of Indian corn. Enormous crops of wheat  may be obtained by irrigation, such as was successfully practiced  by the great Jesuit missions; and, without it, from forty to fifty  bushels to the bushel of seed have been raised. Oats of the kind grown  on the Atlantic grow luxuriantly and wild, self-sown on all the hills  of the coast, furnishing"]]]
