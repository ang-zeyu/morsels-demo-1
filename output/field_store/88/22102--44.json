Pink slammed the door upon their jibes and offered Andy a cigarette he  had just rolled; not that Andy was too sick to roll his own, but  because Pink was notably soft-hearted toward a sick man and was prone  to indulge himself in trifling attentions.    \"Yuh don't want to mind that bunch,\" he placated. \"They mean all  right, but they just can't help joshing a man to death.\"    Andy accepted also a light for the cigarette, and smoked moodily. \"It  ain't their joshing,\" he explained after a minute \"It's puzzling over  what I can't understand that gets on my nerves. I can't see through  the thing, Pink, no way I look at it.\"    \"Looks plain enough to me,\" Pink answered. \"Uh course, it's funny  Blink should be the man, and be setting there listening--\"    \"Yes, but darn it all, Pink, there's a funnier side to it than that,  and it's near driving me crazy trying to figure it out. Yuh needn't  tell anybody, Pink, but it's like this: I was just merely and simply  romancing when I told that there blood-curdling tale! I never was  south uh the Wyoming line except when I was riding in a circus and  toured through, and that's the truth. I never was down in the San  Simon basin. I never set on no pinnacle with no field glasses--\" Andy  stopped short his labored confession to gaze, with deep disgust, upon  Pink's convulsed figure. \"Well,\" he snapped, settling back on the  pillow, \"_laugh_, darn yuh! and show your ignorance! By gracious, I  wish _I_ could see the joke!\" He reached up gingerly and readjusted  the bandage on his head, eyed Pink sourly a moment, and with a grunt  eloquent of the mood he was in turned his face to the wall.           *       *       *       *       *          MISS MARTIN'S MISSION      When Andy Green, fresh-combed and shining with soap and towel polish,  walked into the dining-room of the Dry Lake Hotel, he felt not the  slightest premonition of what was about to befall. His chief sensation  was the hunger which comes of early rising and of many hours spent in  the open, and beyond that he was hoping that the Chinaman cook had  made some meat-pie, like he had the week before. His eyes, searching  unobtrusively the long table bearing the unmistakable signs of many  other hungry men gone before--for Andy was late--failed to warn him.  He pulled out his chair and sat down, still looking for meat-pie.    \"Good after_noon!_\" cried an eager, feminine voice just across the  table.    Andy started guiltily. He had been dimly aware that some one was  sitting there, but, being occupied with other things, had not given a  thought to the sitter, or a glance. Now he did both while he said good  afternoon with perfunctory politeness.    \"Such a _beau_tiful day, isn't it? _so_ invigorating, like rare, old  wine!\"    Andy assented somewhat dubiously; it had never just struck him that  way; he thought fleetingly that perhaps it was because he had never  come across any rare, old wine. He ventured another glance. She was  not young, and she wore glasses, behind which twinkled very bright  eyes of a shade of brown. She had unpleasantly regular hair waves on  her temples, and underneath the waves showed streaks of gray. Also,  she wore a black silk waist, and somebody's picture made into a brooch  at her throat. Further, Andy dared not observe. It was enough for one  glance. He looked again for the much-desired meat-pie.    The strange lady ingratiatingly passed him the bread. \"You're a  cowboy, aren't you?\" was the disconcerting question that accompanied  the bread.    \"Well, I--er--I punch cows,\" he admitted guardedly, his gaze elsewhere  than on her face.    \"I _knew_ you were a cowboy, the moment you entered the door! I could  tell by the tan and the straight, elastic walk, and the silk  handkerchief knotted around your throat in that picturesque fashion.  (Oh, I'm older than you, and dare speak as I think!) I've read a great  deal about cowboys, and I do admire you all as a type of free,  great-hearted, noble manhood!\"    Andy looked exactly as if someone had caught him at something  exceedingly foolish. He tried to sugar his coffee calmly, and so sent  it sloshing all over the saucer.    \"Do you live near here?\" she asked next, beaming upon him in the  orthodox, motherly fashion.    \"Yes, ma'am, not very near,\" he was betrayed into saying--and she  might make what she could of it. He had not said \"ma'am\" before since  he had gone to school.    \"Oh, I've heard how you Western folks measure distances,\" she teased.  \"About how many miles?\"    \"About twenty.\"    \"I suppose that is not far, to you knights of the plains. At home it  would be called a _dreadfully_ long journey. Why, I have known numbers  of old men and women who have never been so far from their own doors  in their lives! What would you think, I wonder, of their little forty  acre farms?\"    Andy had been brought to his sixteenth tumultuous birthday on a  half-acre in the edge of a good-sized town, but he did not say so. He  shook his head vaguely and said he didn't know. Andy Green, however,  was not famous for clinging ever to the truth.    \"You out here in this great, wide, free land, with the free winds ever  blowing and the clouds--\"    \"Will you pass the butter, please?\" Andy hated to interrupt, but he  was hungry.    The strange lady passed the butter and sent with it a smile. \"I have  read and heard so much about this wild, free life, and my heart has  gone out to the noble fellows living their lonely life with their  cattle and their faithful dogs, lying beside their camp-fires at night  while the stars stood guard--\"    Andy forgot his personal embarrassment and began to perk up his ears.  This was growing interesting.    \"--And I have felt how lonely they must be, with their rude fare and  few pleasures, and what a field there must be among them for a great  and noble work; to uplift them and bring into their lonely lives a  broader, deeper meaning; to help them to help themselves to be better,  nobler men and women--\"    \"We don't have any lady cowpunchers out here,\" interposed Andy mildly.    The strange lady had merely gone astray a bit, being accustomed to  addressing Mothers' Meetings and the like. She recovered herself  easily. \"Nobler men, the bulwarks of our nation.\" She stopped and eyed  Andy archly. Andy, having observed that her neck was scrawny, with  certain cords down the sides that moved unpleasantly when she talked,  tried not to look.    \"I wonder if you can guess what brings me out here, away from home and  friends! Can you guess?\"    Andy thought of several things, but he could not feel that it would be  polite to mention them. Agent for complexion stuff, for instance, and  next to that, wanting a husband. He shook his head again and looked at  his potato.    \"You _can't guess_?\" The tone was the one commonly employed for the  encouragement, and consequent demoralization of, a primary class. Andy  realized that he was being talked down to, and his combativeness  awoke. \"Well, away back in my home town, a woman's club has been  thinking of all you lonely fellows, and have felt their hearts swell  with a desire to help you--so far from home and mother's influence,  with only the coarse pleasures of the West, and amid all the  temptations that lie in wait--\" She caught herself back from  speech-making--\"and they have sent _me_--away out here--to be your  _friend_; to help you to help yourselves become better, truer men  and--\" She did not say women, though, poor soul, she came near it.  \"So, I am going to be your friend. I want to get in touch with you  all, first; to win your confidence and teach you to look upon me in  the light of a mother. Then, when I have won your confidence, I want  to organize a Cowboys' Mutual Improvement and Social Society, to help  you in the way of self-improvement and to resist the snares laid for  homeless boys like you. Don't you think I'm very--_brave_?\" She was  smiling at him again, leaning back in her chair and regarding him  playfully over her glasses.    \"You sure are,\" Andy assented, deliberately refraining from saying  \"yes, ma'am,\" as had been his impulse.    \"To come away out here--_all alone_--among all you wild cowboys with  your guns buckled on and your wicked little mustangs--Are you sure you  won't shoot me?\"    Andy eyed her pityingly. If she meant it, he thought, she certainly  was wabbly in her mind. If she thought that was the only kind of talk  he could savvy, then she was a blamed idiot; either way, he felt  antagonistic. \"The law shall be respected in your case,\" he told her,  very gravely.    She smiled almost as if she could see the joke; after which she became  twitteringly, eagerly in earnest. \"Since you live near here, you must  know the Whitmores. Miss Whitmore came out here, two or three years  ago, and married her brother's coachman, I believe--though I've heard  conflicting stories about it; some have said he was an artist, and  others that he was a jockey, or horse-trainer. I heard too that he was  a cowboy; but Miss Whitmore certainly wrote about this young man  driving her brother's carriage. However, she is married and I have a  letter of introduction to her. The president of our club used to be a  schoolmate of her mother. I shall stop with them--I have heard so much  about the Western hospitality--and shall get into touch with my  cowboys from the vantage point of proximity. Did you say you know  them?\"    \"I work for them,\" Andy told her truthfully in his deep amazement, and  immediately repented and wished that he had not been so virtuous. With  Andy, to wish was to do--given the opportunity.    \"Then I can go with you out to their farm--ranchero! How nice! And on  the way you can tell me all about yourself and your life and  hopes--because I do want to get in touch with you all, you know--and  I'll tell you all my plans for you; I have some _beau_tiful plans!

CHAPTER V    THE LETTERS OF THE GAONIM        Representative Gaonim:      Achai, Amram, Zemach, Saadiah, Sherira, Samuel, Hai.      For several centuries after the completion of the Talmud, Babylonia or  Persia continued to hold the supremacy in Jewish learning. The great  teachers in the Persian schools followed the same lines as their  predecessors in the Mishnah and the Talmud. Their name was changed more  than their character. The title _Gaon_ (\"Excellence\") was applied to the  head of the school, the members of which devoted themselves mainly to  the study and interpretation of the older literature. They also made  original contributions to the store. Of their extensive works but little  has been preserved. What has survived proves that they were gifted with  the faculty of applying old precept to modern instance. They regulated  the social and religious affairs of all the Jews in the diaspora. They  improved educational methods, and were pioneers in the popularization of  learning. By a large collection of Case Law, that is, decisions in  particular cases, they brought the newer Jewish life into moral harmony  with the principles formulated by the earlier Rabbis. The Gaonim were  the originators or, at least, the arrangers of parts of the liturgy.  They composed new hymns and invocations, fixed the order of service, and  established in full vigor a system of _Minhag_, or Custom, whose power  became more and more predominant, not only in religious, but also in  social and commercial affairs.    The literary productions of the Gaonic age open with the _Sheeltoth_  written by Achai in the year 760. This, the first independent book  composed after the close of the Talmud, was curiously enough compiled  in Palestine, whither Achai had migrated from Persia. The Sheeltoth  (\"Inquiries\") contain nearly two hundred homilies on the Pentateuch. In  the year 880 another Gaon, Amram by name, prepared a _Siddur_, or  Prayer-Book, which includes many remarks on the history of the liturgy  and the customs connected with it. A contemporary of Amram, Zemach, the  son of Paltoi, found a different channel for his literary energies. He  compiled an _Aruch_, or Talmudical Lexicon. Of the most active of the  Gaonim, Saadiah, more will be said in a subsequent chapter. We will now  pass on to Sherira, who in 987 wrote his famous \"Letter,\" containing a  history of the Jewish Tradition, a work which stamps the author as at  once learned and critical. It shows that the Gaonim were not afraid nor  incapable of facing such problems as this: Was the Mishnah _orally_  transmitted to the Amoraim (or Rabbis of the Talmud), or was it  _written down_ by the compiler? Sherira accepted the former alternative.  The latest Gaonim were far more productive than the earlier. Samuel, the  son of Chofni, who died in 1034, and the last of the Gaonim, Hai, who  flourished from 998 to 1038, were the authors of many works on the  Talmud, the Bible, and other branches of Jewish literature. Hai Gaon was  also a poet.    The language used by the Gaonim was at first Hebrew and Aramaic, and the  latter remained the official speech of the Gaonate. In course of time,  Arabic replaced the Aramean dialect, and became the _lingua franca_ of  the Jews.    The formal works of the Gaonim, with certain obvious exceptions, were  not, however, the writings by which they left their mark on their age.  The most original and important of the Gaonic writings were their  \"Letters,\" or \"Answers\" (_Teshuboth_). The Gaonim, as heads of the  school in the Babylonian cities Sura and Pumbeditha, enjoyed far more  than local authority. The Jews of Persia were practically independent of  external control. Their official heads were the Exilarchs, who reigned  over the Jews as viceroys of the caliphs. The Gaonim were the religious  heads of an emancipated community. The Exilarchs possessed a princely  revenue, which they devoted in part to the schools over which the Gaonim  presided. This position of authority, added to the world-wide repute of  the two schools, gave the Gaonim an influence which extended beyond  their own neighborhood. From all parts of the Jewish world their  guidance was sought and their opinions solicited on a vast variety of  subjects, mainly, but not exclusively, religious and literary. Amid the  growing complications of ritual law, a desire was felt for terse  prescriptions, clear-cut decisions, and rules of conduct. The  imperfections of study outside of Persia, again, made it essential to  apply to the Gaonim for authoritative expositions of difficult passages  in the Bible and the Talmud. To all such enquiries the Gaonim sent  responses in the form of letters, sometimes addressed to individual  correspondents, sometimes to communities or groups of communities. These  Letters and other compilations containing Halachic (or practical)  decisions were afterwards collected into treatises, such as the \"Great  Rules\" (_Halachoth Gedoloth_), originally compiled in the eighth  century, but subsequently reedited. Mostly, however, the Letters were  left in loose form, and were collected in much later times.    The Letters of the Gaonim have little pretence to literary form. They  are the earliest specimens of what became a very characteristic branch  of Jewish literature. \"Questions and Answers\" (_Shaaloth u-Teshuboth_)  abound in later times in all Jewish circles, and there is no real  parallel to them in any other literature. More will be said later on as  to these curious works. So far as the Gaonic period is concerned, the  characteristics of these thousands of letters are lucidity of thought  and terseness of expression. The Gaonim never waste a word. They are  rarely over-bearing in manner, but mostly use a tone which is persuasive  rather than disciplinary. The Gaonim were, in this real sense,  therefore, princes of letter-writing. Moreover, though their Letters  deal almost entirely with contemporary affairs, they now constitute as  fresh and vivid reading as when first penned. Subjected to the severe  test of time, the Letters of the Gaonim emerge triumphant.      BIBLIOGRAPHY    GAONIM.    Graetz.--III, 4-8.    Steinschneider.--_Jewish Literature_, p. 25.          CHAPTER VI    THE KARAITIC LITERATURE         Anan, Nahavendi, Abul-Faraj, Salman, Sahal, al-Bazir, Hassan,       Japhet, Kirkisani, Judah Hadassi, Isaac Troki.      In the very heart of the Gaonate, the eighth century witnessed a  religious and literary reaction against Rabbinism. The opposition to the  Rabbinite spirit was far older than this, but it came to a head under  Anan, the son of David, the founder of Karaism. Anan had been an  unsuccessful candidate for the dignity of Exilarch, and thus personal  motives were involved in his attack on the Gaonim. But there were other  reasons for the revolt. In the same century, Islam, like Judaism, was  threatened by a fierce antagonism between the friends and the foes of  tradition. In Islam the struggle lay between the Sunnites, who  interpreted Mohammedanism in accordance with authorized tradition, and  the Shiites, who relied exclusively upon the Koran. Similarly, in  Judaism, the Rabbinites obeyed the traditions of the earlier  authorities, and the Karaites (from _Kera_, or _Mikra_, i.e. \"Bible\")  claimed the right to reject tradition and revert to the Bible as the  original source of inspiration. Such reactions against tradition are  recurrent in all religions.    Karaism, however, was not a true reaction against tradition. It replaced  an old tradition by a new one; it substituted a rigid, unprogressive  authority for one capable of growth and adaptation to changing  requirements. In the end, Karaism became so hedged in by its supposed  avoidance of tradition that it ceased to be a living force. But we are  here not concerned with the religious defects of Karaism. Regarded from  the literary side, Karaism produced a double effect. Karaism itself gave  birth to an original and splendid literature, and, on the other hand,  coming as it did at the time when Arabic science and poetry were  attaining their golden zenith, Karaism aroused within the Rabbinite  sphere a notable energy, which resulted in some of the best work of  medieval Jews.    Among the most famous of the Karaite authors was Benjamin Nahavendi, who  lived at the beginning of the ninth century, and displayed much  resolution and ability as an advocate of free-thought in religion.  Nahavendi not only wrote commentaries on the Bible, but also attempted  to write a philosophy of Judaism, being allied to Philo in the past and  to the Arabic writers in his own time. At the end of the ninth century,  Abul-Faraj Harun made a great stride forwards as an expounder of the  Bible and as an authority on Hebrew grammar.    During the ninth and tenth centuries, several Karaites revealed much  vigor and ability in their controversies with the Gaonim. In this field  the most distinguished Karaitic writers were Salman, the son of Yerucham  (885-960); Sahal, the son of Mazliach (900-950); Joseph al-Bazir  (flourished 910-930); Hassan, the son of Mashiach (930); and Japhet, the  son of Ali (950-990).    Salman, the son of Yerucham, was an active traveller; born in Egypt, he  went as a young man to Jerusalem, which he made his head-quarters for  several years, though he paid occasional visits to Babylonia and to his  native land. These journeys helped to unify the scattered Karaite  communities. Besides his Biblical works, Salman composed a poetical  treatise against the Rabbinite theories. To this book, which was written  in Hebrew, Salman gave the title, \"The Wars of the Lord.\"    Sahal, the son of Mazliach, on the other hand, was a native of the Holy  Land, and though an eager polemical writer against the"]]]
