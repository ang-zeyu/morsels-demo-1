The three boats which towed us, soon brought us to a distance from the  vessel; they had a good wind, and the sailors rowed like men who were  resolved to save themselves from the imminent danger which threatened us.  The long-boat, and the pinnace were at some distance, and attempted to  return on board; lastly, M. De Chaumareys embarked in his barge, by one of  the ropes a-head: some sailors threw themselves into it, and loosened the  ropes, by which it was lashed to the frigate. Immediately the cries of the  people who remained on board redoubled, and an officer of the troops even  took up a carbine to fire at the captain: but was prevented. We soon saw  that this man was not equal to his duty; from the manner in which he  abandoned his people. We regretted that the arm of the officer had been  withheld when he wished to prevent the captain's design; but, our regret  was unavailing; the mischief was done; it was irreparable; he had no idea  of repairing it, and he could not return on board, for he was sure to meet  there with that death, which he sought to avoid, at the expence of honor.    M. de Chaumareys, however, went on board the long-boat, and gave order that  it should take in the men who remained on board the frigate.[B4] Some  persons belonging to this boat have informed us, that they were told there  were, at the most, about twenty who could not embark; but, the long-boat,  destitute of oars, attempted, to no purpose, to get back to the frigate; a  boat tried, without success, to tow it; it could not attain the object,  till it sent the pinnace to fetch some long ropes, one end of which was  lashed to the frigate, and the other brought on board the long-boat, which  was thus towed to the larboard side of the ship. Lieutenant Espiau, who  commanded this large boat, was surprised at finding above sixty soldiers  and sailors, instead of twenty. This officer went on board with Mr. Bredif,  engineer of mines, who tried to recall to their reason, those whose  intellectual faculties had been impaired by the presence of danger. Mr.  Espiau, embarked with proper order, the men who were on the deck; seventeen  only as we have said, refused; some fearing that the boat would founder  before she could reach the raft, and the other boats, which left it more  and more behind; some others, because they were too much intoxicated as we  have stated, to think of their safety.[B5] The fears of the former, (and  they are probably those who, according to the deposition of Dales, returned  on board the frigate) were founded on the bad condition of the long-boat,  which let in the water on every side. After promising the men who persisted  in remaining, that assistance should be sent them, as soon as the others  arrived at Senegal, the long-boat stood off to join the little division.  Before he left the frigate, Mr. Espiau had the grand national flag  hoisted.[A8]    When this boat left the frigate to join us, we were, at least, a league and  a half distant; the captain's barge had come some time before to take the  towrope, and was at the head of the line; the smallest of the boats (the  pinnace) did not take the towline; it preceded the little division,  probably to take soundings.    As soon as all the boats had taken their post, cries of \"_Vive le Roi!_\"  were a thousand times repeated by the men upon the raft, and a little white  flag was hoisted at the top of a musket. Such was the order of the boats  and the raft. The chiefs of the little division which was to conduct us to  the land, had sworn not to abandon us: we are far from accusing all those  gentlemen of having violated the laws of honor; but a series of  circumstances obliged them to renounce the generous plan which they had  formed to save us, or to perish with us. These circumstances deserve to be  scrupulously examined; but our pen, guided by truth, must not fear to  record facts which truth itself dictates. It is true they are of so strange  a nature, that it is unpleasant to make them known. It is painful to us, to  have to recount such events: we have to shew to what a degree the  imagination of man is susceptible of being struck by the presence of  danger, so as to make him even forget the duties which honour imposes on  him. We, doubtless, admit that in forsaking the raft, the minds of those  who did so, were greatly agitated, and that the desire of withdrawing  themselves from danger, made them forget that a hundred and fifty  unfortunate men were going to be abandoned to the most cruel sufferings. We  shall relate the facts as we observed them, and as they have been  communicated to us, by some of our companions in misfortune.    Before we proceed, we will describe the construction of this raft, to which  a hundred and fifty persons were entrusted.    It was composed of the top-masts of the frigate, yards, fishes, boom, &c.  These different pieces joined together by very strong ropes, were perfectly  solid; the two principal pieces were two top-masts, which were placed at  the extremity of the two sides; four other masts, two of which were of the  same length and strength as the first, joined two by two, at the center of  the machine, added to its solidity. The other pieces were placed within  these four first but were not equal to them in length. Boards were nailed  on this first foundation, and formed a kind of parapet, which would have  been of great service to us if it had been higher. To render our raft still  more solid, long pieces of wood had been placed across, which projected at  least three metres: on the sides, there was a kind of railing, but it was  not above forty centimetres in height: it would have been easy to add some  crotches to it, which would have formed a breast-work of sufficient height;  but it was not done, probably because those who had the machine built, were  not to be exposed upon it. To the ends of the top-masts, two top-gallant  yards were lashed, the farther ends of which were bound by a very strong  cord, and thus formed the front part of the raft. The angular space, formed  by the two yards, was filled with pieces of wood laid across, and planks  ill adjusted. This fore part, which was at least two metres in length, had  very little solidity, and was continually submerged. The hinder part did  not terminate in a point like the fore part, but a considerable length of  this part was not more solid, so that in fact, there was only the center  which was really to be depended upon: an example will enable the reader to  judge of its dimensions. When we were no more than fifteen in it, we had  not space enough to lie down, and yet we were extremely close together. The  raft, from one extremity, to the other was at least twenty metres in  length, and about seven in breadth; this length might induce one to think,  at the first sight, that it was able to carry two hundred men, but we soon  had cruel proofs of its weakness. It was without sails or mast. As we left  the frigate they threw us the fore-top-gallant and the main-top-gallant  sails; but they did it with such precipitation, that, some persons who were  at their post, were in danger of being wounded by the fall of these sails,  which were bent to the yards. They did not give us any ropes to set up our  mast.    There was on board the raft a great quantity of barrels of flour, which had  been deposited there the preceding day, not to serve for provisions during  the passage, from the frigate to the coast, but because the raft, formed of  the barrels, not having succeeded, they were deposited on the machine, that  they might not be carried away by the sea, there were also six barrels of  wine and two small casks of water, which had been put there for the use of  the people.    Scarcely fifty men had got upon the raft, when it sunk at least seventy  centimetres under water; so that to facilitate the embarkation of the other  soldiers it was necessary to throw into the sea all the flour barrels,  which lifted by the waves, began to float and were violently driven against  the men who were at their post; if they had been fixed, perhaps some of  them might have been saved: as it was, we saved only the wine and the  water, because several persons united to preserve them, and had much  difficulty to hinder them from being thrown into the sea like the flour  barrels. The raft, lightened by throwing away these barrels, was able to  receive more men; we were at length a hundred and fifty. The machine was  submerged at least a metre: we were so crowded together that it was  impossible to take a single step; at the back and the front, we were in  water up to the middle. At the moment that we were; putting off, from the  frigate, a bag with twenty-five pounds of biscuit was thrown us, which fell  into the sea; we got it up with difficulty; it was converted into a paste,  but we preserved it in that condition. Several considerate persons fastened  the casks of wine and water to the cross pieces of the raft, and we kept a  strict watch over them. Thus we have faithfully described the nature of our  situation when we put off from the vessel.    The Commander of the raft was named Coudin who was, what is called in the  French marine an _Aspirant_ of the first class. Some days before our  departure from the roads of the Isle of Aix, he had received a severe  contusion on the fore part of the right leg, which was not approaching to  its cure, when we stranded and wholly incapacitated him from moving. One of  his comrades, moved by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1182"],[0,"Dope (#7)"],[1,"   \"Is it something big?\" he asked.    \"Sure,\" snapped Kerry. \"Do they send me to stop dog-fights?\"    Knowing the man and recognizing the mood, Coombes became silent,  and this silence he did not break all the way to Vine Street. At the  station:    \"Wait,\" said Chief Inspector Kerry, and went swinging in, carrying his  overall and having the malacca cane tucked under his arm.    A few minutes later he came out again and reentered the cab.    \"Piccadilly corner of Old Bond Street,\" he directed the man.    \"Is it burglary?\" asked Detective-Sergeant Coombes with interest.    \"No,\" said Kerry. \"It's murder; and there seems to be stacks of  evidence. Sharpen your pencil.\"    \"Oh!\" murmured Coombes.    They were almost immediately at their destination, and Chief Inspector  Kerry, dismissing the cabman, set off along Bond Street with his lithe,  swinging gait, looking all about him intently. Rain had ceased, but the  air was damp and chilly, and few pedestrians were to be seen.    A car was standing before Kazmah's premises, the chauffeur walking up  and down on the pavement and flapping his hands across his chest in  order to restore circulation. The Chief Inspector stopped, \"Hi, my man!\"  he said.    The chauffeur stood still.    \"Whose car?\"    \"Mr. Monte Irvin's.\"    Kerry turned on his heel and stepped to the office door. It was ajar,  and Kerry, taking an electric torch from his overall pocket, flashed the  light upon the name-plate. He stood for a moment, chewing and looking up  the darkened stairs. Then, torch in hand he ascended.    Kazmah's door was closed, and the Chief Inspector rapped loudly. It  was opened at once by Sergeant Burton, and Kerry entered, followed by  Coombes.    The room at first sight seemed to be extremely crowded. Monte Irvin,  very pale and haggard, sat upon the divan beside Quentin Gray. Seton  was standing near the cabinet, smoking. These three had evidently been  conversing at the time of the detective's arrival with an alert-looking,  clean-shaven man whose bag, umbrella, and silk hat stood upon one of the  little inlaid tables. Just inside the second door were Brisley and Gunn,  both palpably ill at ease, and glancing at Inspector Whiteleaf, who had  been interrogating them.    Kerry chewed silently for a moment, bestowing a fierce stare upon each  face in turn, then:    \"Who's in charge?\" he snapped.    \"I am,\" replied Whiteleaf.    \"Why is the lower door open?\"    \"I thought--\"    \"Don't think. Shut the door. Post your Sergeant inside. No one is to go  out. Grab anybody who comes in. Where's the body?\"    \"This way,\" said Inspector Whiteleaf hurriedly; then, over his shoulder:  \"Go down to the door, Burton.\"    He led Kerry towards the inner room, Coombes at his heels. Brisley and  Gunn stood aside to give them passage; Gray and Monte Irvin prepared to  follow. At the doorway Kerry turned.    \"You will all be good enough to stay where you are,\" he said. He  directed the aggressive stare in Seton's direction. \"And if the  gentleman smoking a cheroot is not satisfied that he has quite destroyed  any clue perceptible by the sense of smell I should be glad to send out  for some fireworks.\"    He tossed his oilskin and his cane on the divan and went into the room  of seance, savagely biting at a piece of apparently indestructible  chewing-gum.    The torn green curtain had been laid aside and the electric lights  turned on in the inside rooms. Pallid, Sir Lucien Pyne lay by the ebony  chair glaring horribly upward.    Always with the keen eyes glancing this way and that, Inspector Kerry  crossed the little audience room and entered the enclosure contained  between the two screens. By the side of the dead man he stood, looking  down silently. Then he dropped upon one knee and peered closely into the  white face. He looked up.    \"He has not been moved?\"    \"No.\"    Kerry bent yet lower, staring closely at a discolored abrasion on Sir  Lucien's forehead. His glance wandered from thence to the carved ebony  chair. Still kneeling, he drew from his waistcoat pocket a powerful lens  contained in a washleather bag. He began to examine the back and sides  of the chair. Once he laid his finger lightly on a protruding point  of the carving, and then scrutinised his finger through the glass. He  examined the dead man's hands, his nails, his garments. Then he crawled  about, peering closely at the carpet.    He stood up suddenly. \"The doctor,\" he snapped.    Inspector Whiteleaf retired, but returned immediately with the  clean-shaven man to whom Monte Irvin had been talking when Kerry  arrived.    \"Good evening, doctor,\" said Kerry. \"Do I know your name? Start your  notes, Coombes.\"    \"My name is Dr. Wilbur Weston, and I live in Albemarle Street.\"    \"Who called you?\"    \"Inspector Whiteleaf telephoned to me about half an hour ago.\"    \"You examined the dead man?\"    \"I did.\"    \"You avoided moving him?\"    \"It was unnecessary to move him. He was dead, and the wound was in the  left shoulder. I pulled his coat open and unbuttoned his shirt. That was  all.\"    \"How long dead?\"    \"I should say he had been dead not more than an hour when I saw him.\"    \"What had caused death?\"    \"The stab of some long, narrow-bladed weapon, such as a stiletto.\"    \"Why a stiletto?\" Kerry's fierce eyes challenged him. \"Did you ever see  a wound made by a stiletto?\"    \"Several--in Italy, and one at Saffron Hill. They are characterised by  very little external bleeding.\"    \"Right, doctor. It had reached his heart?\"    \"Yes. The blow was delivered from behind.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"The direction of the wound is forward. I have seen an almost identical  wound in the case of an Italian woman stabbed by a jealous rival.\"    \"He would fall on his back.\"    \"Oh, no. He would fall on his face, almost certainly.\"    \"But he lies on his back.\"    \"In my opinion he had been moved.\"    \"Right. I know he had. Good night, doctor. See him out, Inspector.\"    Dr. Weston seemed rather startled by this abrupt dismissal, but the  steel-blue eyes of Inspector Kerry were already bent again upon the  dead man, and, murmuring \"good night,\" the doctor took his departure,  followed by Whiteleaf.    \"Shut this door,\" snapped Kerry after the Inspector. \"I will call when I  want you. You stay, Coombes. Got it all down?\"    Sergeant Coombes scratched his head with the end of a pencil, and:    \"Yes,\" he said, with hesitancy. \"That is, except the word after  'narrow-bladed weapon such as a' I've got what looks like 'steelhatto.'\"    Kerry glared.    \"Try taking the cotton-wool out of your ears,\" he suggested. \"The word  was stiletto, s-t-i-l-e-t-t-o--stiletto.\"    \"Oh,\" said Coombes, \"thanks.\"    Silence fell between the two men from Scotland Yard. Kerry stood awhile,  chewing and staring at the ghastly face of Sir Lucien. Then:    \"Go through all pockets,\" he directed.    Sergeant Coombes placed his notebook and pencil upon the seat of the  chair and set to work. Kerry entered the inside room or office. It  contained a writing-table (upon which was a telephone and a pile of old  newspapers), a cabinet, and two chairs. Upon one of the chairs lay  a crush-hat, a cane, and an overcoat. He glanced at some of the  newspapers, then opened the drawers of the writing-table. They were  empty. The cabinet proved to be locked, and a door which he saw must  open upon a narrow passage running beside the suite of rooms was locked  also. There was nothing in the pockets of the overcoat, but inside the  hat he found pasted the initials L. P. He rolled chewing-gum, stared  reflectively at the little window immediately above the table, through  which a glimpse might be obtained of the ebony chair, and went out  again.    \"Nothing,\" reported Coombes.    \"What do you mean--nothing?\"    \"His pockets are empty!\"    \"All of them?\"    \"Every one.\"    \"Good,\" said Kerry. \"Make a note of it. He wears a real pearl stud and a  good signet ring; also a gold wrist watch, face broken and hands stopped  at seven-fifteen. That was the time he died. He was stabbed from behind  as he stood where I'm standing now, fell forward, struck his head on the  leg of the chair, and lay face downwards.\"    \"I've got that,\" muttered Coombes. \"What stopped the watch?\"    \"Broken as he fell. There are tiny fragments of glass stuck in the  carpet, showing the exact position in which his body originally lay; and  for God's sake stop smiling.\"    Kerry threw open the door.    \"Who first found the body?\" he demanded of the silent company.    \"I did,\" cried Quentin Gray, coming forward. \"I and Seton Pasha.\"    \"Seton Pasha!\" Kerry's teeth snapped together, so that he seemed to bite  off the words. \"I don't see a Turk present.\"    Seton smiled quietly.    \"My friend uses a title which was conferred upon me some years ago by  the ex-Khedive,\" he said. \"My name is Greville Seton.\"    Inspector Kerry glanced back across his shoulder.    \"Notes,\" he said. \"Unlock your ears, Coombes.\" He looked at Gray. \"What  is your name?\"    \"Quentin Gray.\"    \"Who are you, and in what way are you concerned in this case?\"    \"I am the son of Lord Wrexborough, and I--\"    He paused, glancing helplessly at Seton. He had recognized that the  first mention of Rita Irvin's name in the police evidence must be made  by himself.    \"Speak up, sir,\" snapped Kerry. \"Sergeant Coombes is deaf.\"    Gray's face flushed, and his eyes gleamed angrily.    \"I should be glad, Inspector,\" he said, \"if you would remember that  the dead man was a personal acquaintance and that other friends are  concerned in this ghastly affair.\"    \"Coombes will remember it,\" replied Kerry frigidly. \"He's taking notes.\"    \"Look here--\" began Gray.    Seton laid his hand upon the angry man's shoulder.    \"Pull up, Gray,\" he said quietly. \"Pull up, old chap.\" He turned his  cool regard upon Chief Inspector Kerry, twirling the cord of his monocle  about one finger. \"I may remark, Inspector Kerry--for I understand  this to be your name--that"]]]
