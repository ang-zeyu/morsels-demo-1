This act had a significance beyond the fact that it established in the  United States of America a flourishing church, which, while completely  loyal to its own country, is bound by special ties to the religious  life of England. It marked the emergence of the Church of England from  that insularity to which what may be called the territorial principles  of the Reformation had condemned her. The change was slow, and it is  not yet by any means complete.    Since the Church of England, whatever her attitude towards the  traditional Catholic doctrines, never disputed the validity of  Catholic orders whether Roman or Orthodox, nor the jurisdiction of  Catholic bishops in foreign countries, the expansion of the Anglican  Church has been in no sense conceived as a Protestant aggressive  movement against Rome. Occasional exceptions, such as the consecration  by Archbishop Plunket of Dublin of a bishop for the reformed church in  Spain, raised so strong a protest as to prove the rule. In the main,  then, the expansion of the Anglican Church has followed that of the  British empire, or, as in America, of its daughter states; its claim,  so far as rights of jurisdiction are concerned, is to be the Church  of England and the English race, while recognizing its special duties  towards the non-Christian populations subject to the empire or brought  within the reach of its influence. As against the Church of Rome, with  its system of rigid centralization, the Anglican Church represents the  principle of local autonomy, which it holds to be once more primitive  and more catholic. In this respect the Anglican communion has  developed on the lines defined in her articles at the Reformation;  but, though in principle there is no great difference between a church  defined by national, and a church defined by racial boundaries, there  is an immense difference in effect, especially when the race--as in  the case of the English--is itself ecumenical.    The realization of what may be called this catholic mission of the  English church, in the extension of its organization to the colonies,  was but a slow process.      _The Church in the Colonies._    On the 12th of August 1787 Dr. Charles Inglis was consecrated bishop  of Nova Scotia, with jurisdiction over all the British possessions in  North America. In 1793 the see of the Quebec was founded; Jamaica  and Barbados followed in 1824, and Toronto and Newfoundland in 1839.  Meanwhile the needs of India has been tardily met, on the urgent  representations in parliament of William Wilberforce and others, by  the consecration of Dr. T.F. Middleton as bishop of Calcutta, with  three archdeacons to assist him. In 1817 Ceylon was added to his  charge; in 1823 all British subjects in the East Indies and the  islands of the Indian Ocean; and in 1824 \"New South Wales and its  dependencies\"! Some five years later, on the nomination of the duke  of Wellington, William Broughton was sent out to work in this enormous  jurisdiction as archdeacon of Australia. Soon afterwards, in 1835  and 1837, the sees of Madras and Bombay were founded; whilst in 1836  Broughton himself was consecrated as first bishop of Australia. Thus  down to 1840 there were but ten colonial bishops; and of these several  were so hampered by civil regulations that they were little more  than government chaplains in episcopal orders. In April of that year,  however, Bishop Blomfield of London published his famous letter to the  archbishop of Canterbury, declaring that \"an episcopal church without  a bishop is a contradiction in terms,\" and strenuously advocating a  great effort for the extension of the episcopate. It was not in vain.  The plan was taken up with enthusiasm, and on Whitsun Tuesday of 1841  the bishops of the United Kingdom met and issued a declaration which  inaugurated the Colonial Bishoprics Council. Subsequent declarations  in 1872 and 1891 have served both to record progress and to stimulate  to new effort. The diocese of New Zealand was founded in 1841, being  endowed by the Church Missionary Society through the council, and  George Augustus Selwyn was chosen as the first bishop. Since then the  increase has gone on, as the result both of home effort and of the  action of the colonial churches. Moreover, in many cases bishops  have been sent to inaugurate new missions, as in the cases of the  Universities' Mission to Central Africa, Lebombo, Corea and New  Guinea; and the missionary jurisdictions so founded develop in time  into dioceses. Thus, instead of the ten colonial jurisdictions  of 1841, there are now about a hundred foreign and colonial  jurisdictions, in addition to those of the Protestant Episcopal Church  of the United States.    [v.02 p.0020]    It was only very gradually that these dioceses acquired legislative  independence and a determinate organization. At first, sees were  created and bishops were nominated by the crown by means of letters  patent; and in some cases an income was assigned out of public  funds. Moreover, for many years all bishops alike were consecrated in  England, took the customary \"oath of due obedience\" to the archbishop  of Canterbury, and were regarded as his extra-territorial suffragans.  But by degrees changes have been made on all these points.      _Provincial Organization._    (1) Local conditions soon made a provincial organization necessary,  and it was gradually introduced. The bishop of Calcutta received  letters patent as metropolitan of India when the sees of Madras and  Bombay were founded; and fresh patents were issued to Bishop Broughton  in 1847 and Bishop Gray in 1853, as metropolitans of Australia and  South Africa respectively. Similar action was taken in 1858, when  Bishop Selwyn became metropolitan of New Zealand; and again in 1860,  when, on the petition of the Canadian bishops to the crown and the  colonial legislature for permission to elect a metropolitan, letters  patent were issued appointing Bishop Fulford of Montreal to that  office. Since then metropolitans have been chosen and provinces formed  by regular synodical action, a process greatly encouraged by  the resolutions of the Lambeth conferences on the subject. The  constitution of these provinces is not uniform. In some cases, as  South Africa, New South Wales, and Queensland, the metropolitan see  is fixed. Elsewhere, as in New Zealand, where no single city can claim  pre-eminence, the metropolitan is either elected or else is the senior  bishop by consecration. Two further developments must be mentioned:  (a) The creation of diocesan and provincial synods, the first diocesan  synod to meet being that of New Zealand in 1844, whilst the formation  of a provincial synod was foreshadowed by a conference of Australasian  bishops at Sydney in 1850; (b) towards the close of the 19th century  the title of _archbishop_ began to be assumed by the metropolitans of  several provinces. It was first assumed by the metropolitans of Canada  and Rupert's Land, at the desire of the Canadian general synod in  1893; and subsequently, in accordance with a resolution of the Lambeth  conference of 1897, it was given by their synods to the bishop of  Sydney as metropolitan of New South Wales and to the bishop of Cape  Town as metropolitan of South Africa. Civil obstacles have hitherto  delayed its adoption by the metropolitan of India.      _Freedom from state control._    (2) By degrees, also, the colonial churches have been freed from their  rather burdensome relations with the state. The church of the West  Indies was disestablished and disendowed in 1868. In 1857 it was  decided, in _Regina_ v. _Eton College_, that the crown could not  claim the presentation to a living when it had appointed the former  incumbent to a colonial bishopric, as it does in the case of an  English bishopric. In 1861, after some protest from the crown lawyers,  two missionary bishops were consecrated without letters patent for  regions outside British territory: C.F. Mackenzie for the Zambezi  region and J.C. Patteson for Melanesia, by the metropolitans of Cape  Town and New Zealand respectively. In 1863 the privy council declared,  in _Long_ v. _The Bishop of Cape Town_, that \"the Church of England,  in places where there is no church established by law, is in the same  situation with any other religious body.\" In 1865 it adjudged Bishop  Gray's letters patent, as metropolitan of Cape Town, to be powerless  to enable him \"to exercise any coercive jurisdiction, or hold any  court or tribunal for that purpose,\" since the Cape colony already  possessed legislative institutions when they were issued; and his  deposition of Bishop Colenso was declared to be \"null and void in law\"  (_re The Bishop of Natal_). With the exception of Colenso the South  African bishops forthwith surrendered their patents, and formally  accepted Bishop Gray as their metropolitan, an example followed in  1865 in the province of New Zealand. In 1862, when the diocese of  Ontario was formed, the bishop was elected in Canada, and consecrated  under a royal mandate, letters patent being by this time entirely  discredited. And when, in 1867, a coadjutor was chosen for the bishop  of Toronto, an application for a royal mandate produced the reply  from the colonial secretary that \"it was not the part of the crown  to interfere in the creation of a new bishop or bishopric, and not  consistent with the dignity of the crown that he should advise Her  Majesty to issue a mandate which would not be worth the paper on which  it was written, and which, having been sent out to Canada, might be  disregarded in the most complete manner.\" And at the present day the  colonial churches are entirely free in this matter. This, however,  is not the case with the church in India. Here the bishops of sees  founded down to 1879 receive a stipend from the revenue (with the  exception of the bishop of Ceylon, who no longer does so).
