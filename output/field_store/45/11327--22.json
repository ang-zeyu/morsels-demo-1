Thus it is said that \"he is of the essence of understanding,    __________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: It is possible that there is a vague and obscure reference  here to the doctrine that the fruits of our deeds are reaped in other  worlds.]    56    of the vital function, of the visual sense, of the auditory sense, of  the essence of the five elements (which would make up the  physical body in accordance with its needs) or the essence of desires,  of the essence of restraint of desires, of the essence of anger, of  the essence of turning off from all anger, of the essence of dharma,  of the essence of adharma, of the essence of all that is this  (manifest) and that is that (unmanifest or latent)\" (B@rh. IV. iv. 5).  The self that undergoes rebirth is thus a unity not only of moral  and psychological tendencies, but also of all the elements which  compose the physical world. The whole process of his changes  follows from this nature of his; for whatever he desires, he wills  and whatever he wills he acts, and in accordance with his acts  the fruit happens. The whole logic of the genesis of karma and  its fruits is held up within him, for he is a unity of the moral  and psychological tendencies on the one hand and elements of  the physical world on the other.    The self that undergoes rebirth being a combination of diverse  psychological and moral tendencies and the physical elements  holds within itself the principle of all its transformations. The  root of all this is the desire of the self and the consequent fruition  of it through will and act. When the self continues to desire and  act, it reaps the fruit and comes again to this world for performing  acts. This world is generally regarded as the field for performing  karma, whereas other worlds are regarded as places where the  fruits of karma are reaped by those born as celestial beings. But  there is no emphasis in the Upani@sads on this point. The Pit@ryana  theory is not indeed given up, but it seems only to form a part  in the larger scheme of rebirth in other worlds and sometimes in  this world too. All the course of these rebirths is effected by the  self itself by its own desires, and if it ceases to desire, it suffers no  rebirth and becomes immortal. The most distinctive feature of  this doctrine is this, that it refers to desires as the cause of rebirth  and not karma. Karma only comes as the connecting link between  desires and rebirth--for it is said that whatever a man desires he  wills, and whatever he wills he acts.    Thus it is said in another place \"he who knowingly desires is  born by his desires in those places (accordingly), but for him whose  desires have been fulfilled and who has realized himself, all his  desires vanish here\" (Mu@n@d III. 2. 2). This destruction of desires  is effected by the right knowledge of the self. \"He who knows    57    his self as 'I am the person' for what wish and for what desire  will he trouble the body,...even being here if we know it, well if  we do not, what a great destruction\" (B@rh. IV. iv. 12 and 14). \"In  former times the wise men did not desire sons, thinking what  shall we do with sons since this our self is the universe\" (B@rh. IV.  iv. 22). None of the complexities of the karma doctrine which  we find later on in more recent developments of Hindu thought  can be found in the Upani@sads. The whole scheme is worked  out on the principle of desire (_kama_) and karma only serves as  the link between it and the actual effects desired and willed by  the person.    It is interesting to note in this connection that consistently  with the idea that desires (_kama_) led to rebirth, we find that  in some Upani@sads the discharge of the semen in the womb of a  woman as a result of desires is considered as the first birth of  man, and the birth of the son as the second birth and the birth  elsewhere after death is regarded as the third birth. Thus it is  said, \"It is in man that there comes first the embryo, which is  but the semen which is produced as the essence of all parts of  his body and which holds itself within itself, and when it is put  in a woman, that is his first birth. That embryo then becomes  part of the woman's self like any part of her body; it therefore  does not hurt her; she protects and develops the embryo within  herself. As she protects (the embryo) so she also should be  protected. It is the woman who bears the embryo (before birth)  but when after birth the father takes care of the son always, he  is taking care only of himself, for it is through sons alone that  the continuity of the existence of people can be maintained. This  is his second birth. He makes this self of his a representative  for performing all the virtuous deeds. The other self of his after  realizing himself and attaining age goes away and when going  away he is born again that is his third birth\" (Aitareya, II. 1-4)  [Footnote ref 1]. No special emphasis is given in the Upani@sads to  the sex-desire or the desire for a son; for, being called kama, whatever  was the desire for a son was the same as the desire for money and the  desire for money was the same as any other worldly desire (B@rh.  IV. iv. 22), and hence sex-desires stand on the same plane as any  other desire.    _____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: See also Kau@sitaki, II. 15.]    58      Emancipation.    The doctrine which next attracts our attention in this connection  is that of emancipation (_mukti_). Already we know that the  doctrine of Devayana held that those who were faithful and performed  asceticism (_tapas_) went by the way of the gods through  successive stages never to return to the world and suffer rebirth.  This could be contrasted with the way of the fathers (_pit@ryana_)  where the dead were for a time recompensed in another world and  then had to suffer rebirth. Thus we find that those who are faithful  and perform _s'raddha_ had a distinctly different type of goal from  those who performed ordinary virtues, such as those of a general  altruistic nature. This distinction attains its fullest development  in the doctrine of emancipation. Emancipation or Mukti means  in the Upani@sads the state of infiniteness that a man attains  when he knows his own self and thus becomes Brahman. The  ceaseless course of transmigration is only for those who are  ignorant. The wise man however who has divested himself of all  passions and knows himself to be Brahman, at once becomes  Brahman and no bondage of any kind can ever affect him.      He who beholds that loftiest and deepest,    For him the fetters of the heart break asunder,    For him all doubts are solved,    And his works become nothingness [Footnote ref 1].    The knowledge of the self reveals the fact that all our passions  and antipathies, all our limitations of experience, all that is  ignoble and small in us, all that is transient and finite in us is  false. We \"do not know\" but are \"pure knowledge\" ourselves.  We are not limited by anything, for we are the infinite; we do  not suffer death, for we are immortal. Emancipation thus is not  a new acquisition, product, an effect, or result of any action, but  it always exists as the Truth of our nature. We are always  emancipated and always free. We do not seem to be so and  seem to suffer rebirth and thousands of other troubles only because  we do not know the true nature of our self. Thus it is that the  true knowledge of self does not lead to emancipation but is  emancipation itself. All sufferings and limitations are true only  so long as we do not know our self. Emancipation is the natural  and only goal of man simply because it represents the true nature  and essence of man. It is the realization of our own nature that    _____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Deussen's _Philosophy of the Upanishads_, p. 352.]    59    is called emancipation. Since we are all already and always in  our own true nature and as such emancipated, the only thing  necessary for us is to know that we are so. Self-knowledge is therefore  the only desideratum which can wipe off all false knowledge,  all illusions of death and rebirth. The story is told in the Ka@tha  Upani@sad that Yama, the lord of death, promised Naciketas,  the son of Gautama, to grant him three boons at his choice.  Naciketas, knowing that his father Gautama was offended with  him, said, \"O death let Gautama be pleased in mind and forget  his anger against me.\" This being granted Naciketas asked the  second boon that the fire by which heaven is gained should be  made known to him. This also being granted Naciketas said,  \"There is this enquiry, some say the soul exists after the death  of man; others say it does not exist. This I should like to know  instructed by thee. This is my third boon.\" Yama said, \"It was  inquired of old, even by the gods; for it is not easy to understand  it. Subtle is its nature, choose another boon. Do not  compel me to this.\" Naciketas said, \"Even by the gods was it  inquired before, and even thou O Death sayest that it is not easy  to understand it, but there is no other speaker to be found like  thee. There is no other boon like this.\" Yama said, \"Choose sons  and grandsons who may live a hundred years, choose herds of  cattle; choose elephants and gold and horses; choose the wide  expanded earth, and live thyself as many years as thou wishest.  Or if thou knowest a boon like this choose it together with wealth  and far-extending life. Be a king on the wide earth. I will make  thee the enjoyer of all desires. All those desires that are difficult  to gain in the world of mortals, all those ask thou at thy pleasure;  those fair nymphs with their chariots, with their musical instruments;  the like of them are not to be gained by men.

Grand  Master, proclaim that Dumiger has won the prize, that Dumiger is  great.\"    Joy thrilled through Marguerite's frame.    The Grand Master rose, and his voice trembled with anxiety and secret  pleasure as he spoke.    \"It is too true,\" he said; \"the clock is sold to Hamburg, and Dumiger  has lost his rights of citizenship here by becoming a freeman of that  town. The prize, therefore, in accordance with the decision of the  council, is adjudged to the second--to my son.\"    Then the anger of the people rose, wild and savage; in one moment,  like the bursting of a thunder-cloud, the whole aspect of the place  had changed.    \"Show us the deed!\" they exclaimed.    The stranger took it and held it up. There was no mistaking it; it  was headed by the arms of Hamburg, and signed by Dumiger. The storm of  indignation had subsided for a moment, but only as it seemed to gain  additional strength.    \"Tear him in pieces--he shall not have the clock. Down with  Dumiger--crucify the man who could prefer the freedom of Hamburg to  the honors of Dantzic. Down with him!\"    And the people tore up the benches, drove back the burgher guard;  some of the boldest dashed on the platform; the Grand Council had to  escape, carrying the stranger with them. The mob tore out of the hall,  and told their friends outside--anger led to anger, the passions rose  like the waves at the equinox. Nothing could stop the mob, from so  apparently trifling a cause a tumult was created; the jealousy of the  townsmen now appeared--that jealousy, smothered and subdued for so  many years, burst forth in this madness.    Poor Marguerite had fainted. Carl and Krantz, by herculean exertions,  dragged her through the mob; she was taken to a small room over the  great hall, and laid there until the storm should be appeased.    It did not seem likely to be so. Unfortunately, one of the guards had  in the tumult struck a burgher; in some of the smaller streets they  were even now fighting; but the crowd in the great square seemed  to have a firmer purpose, there was a gradual calm. At last one man  climbed up the statue in the Center of the square.    \"Where is Dumiger?\" he asked.    And another voice answered, \"He is in the debtor's prison.\"    \"We will go and lead him to his triumph,\" was the dark and threatening  reply of the people, who now moved forward in columns.      CHAPTER VI.    The two days which elapsed since the interview with the stranger had  been passed by Dumiger in great misery. He blamed himself deeply for  having been so easily entrapped into what he feared would prove a  snare, and very foolishly, as we have seen, he wrote to Marguerite  that she had everything to hope, as he still retained the desire of  being honored by his fellow-townsmen, although they were not to enjoy  the fruit of his labors.    On the eventful morning which has been described, Dumiger arose full  of hope, his triumph was to be secured; and in the evening he even  entertained a secret impression and belief that the people would not  permit the clock to be removed, and that the error he had made might  be retrieved by their energetic wills. He heard the bands of music  playing in the distance. The merry chimes floated over the water, and  bade him good speed. He thought that he could even discern the buzz of  enjoyment, and the shout of anticipated triumph. He took out the last  letter which Marguerite had written to him, and pressed it to his  heart; that day, he thought, was to see them united never to be parted  again.    What sound was that?--Was it the wind? No, the murmur of many voices,  the tramp of a thousand feet, shook the drawbridge. He heard his  own name called out. Yes, it is! it surely cannot be an error; it  is Dumiger they are invoking. Now there can be no mistake, the crowd  unite in one loud cry,--    \"Where is Dumiger?\"    \"I am here, I am here,\" he shrieks out; \"Open the gates.\"    What could it mean? the guards were resisting. There is a shot  fired--is this the way in which a triumph is conducted? There is a  pause--a parley.    \"We want the man Dumiger, the prisoner,\" exclaims one.    \"Good, you shall have him. Let but a few enter,\" says the lieutenant  of the tower, \"and the guard shall withdraw.\"    Immediately there is a loud rush on the stair, not the tramp, tramp,  of regular troops.    \"Here, here!\" exclaims Dumiger; \"here am I, my friends! Welcome,  welcome!\" and he rushes to embrace the first who enters.    \"Back, traitor!\" answers the man.    Dumiger tumbles against the wall in terror and astonishment.    \"Yes, you are the traitor,\" continued he who acted the part of leader  of the motley crowd; \"you have sold your birthright--you have betrayed  our interests. What punishment is fit for such a usurer?\"    \"Down, down with him,\" cried the mob.    The leaders consulted together for one moment.    \"My good people,\" continued the same man, \"we have taken counsel, and  you shall redress. We will not take this man's life. This is what we  decide,--We will keep the clock to be the glory of our town, but he  shall never see it, neither shall he have it any more in his power to  make another equal to it or better, for we will put out his eyes.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" vociferated the mob, \"it is excellent. Put out his eyes at  once.\"    Before Dumiger could collect his scattered senses two strong, stalwart  men had seized him. In spite of his shrieks and entreaties they threw  him down on the straw; one more savage than the rest drew forth a  small knife--agony on agony! horror on horror! in one moment to the  living man there was Cimmerian darkness. The deed was done, and they  who had done it looked on with horror and fear at their own crime.  There were no shrieks to break the fearful silence: a few inarticulate  sobs of heart wrung from his misery were all that was heard, and the  mob withdrew silent and repentant.    Carl had followed at a distance. He had made frantic, but ineffectual  efforts to enter the cell; when the crowd dispersed he went up the  stairs without impediment, and there he found his friend extended. He  raised him, he bore him home with those sightless, bleeding orbs. He  comes, Marguerite; hasten forth to meet your husband: let the light of  your love bless him, for the light of Heaven has departed forever.      CONCLUSION.    There is great excitement in Dantzic, for the noble clock, which  has been for ten years the marvel of Germany,--the clock which was  made by the cunningest artificers who followed Dumiger's model, has  stopped. No one can arrange it; the model was broken up as a jealous  precaution. There is but one who understands it--who can regulate the  wondrous movement; that is he who constructed it.    Yes. the Council will go to Dumiger. They seek his house; they repent  of the fearful crime they committed.    \"Dumiger, come forth!\" they exclaim. \"Forgive us our offense. Greatest  of citizens, all honors and rewards shall be heaped upon you. Regulate  this great work, prized above all others in this city, for which  we contended for five years with Hamburg. Stand forth in glory and  honor!\"    And a man, young in years, but decrepit in suffering, appears,  supported by two friends. The partner of his hopes and fears is long  since dead. The streets ring with applause as he appears, and many  kneel to kiss his hand--ay, some his feet. But all he asks is to be  led first to Marguerite's grave. There, in the presence of thousands,  he prays for strength; and then he desires them to conduct him to the  clock-tower.    When he appears outside, the air is rent with shouts. \"Dumiger,  Dumiger, the first of the citizens!\" Oh, popular feeling, at once base  and baseless!    He seems to see the works again; he climbs up and touches every part  of the wonderful construction--his hand has found the secret of the  movement, again it is in order, and the pride of Dantzic is saved.    He stands still for some minutes. A god could not have been more  worshiped, or a prophet looked grander. Again his hand is on the  movement--crash, crash,--the slight spring on which the whole  machinery depended is rent asunder by his own hand; the clock falls  to pieces, never to be repaired. At the same moment there is a fall, a  fearful groan, and Dumiger lies on the pavement a bleeding corpse. The  clock and its maker have ceased to exist.    Such is the legend, and from that day there has been no clock in the  Dom of Dantzic.           *       *       *       *       *    THE SHIP \"EXTRAVAGANCE.\"      Oh, Extravagance saileth in climes bright and warm.
