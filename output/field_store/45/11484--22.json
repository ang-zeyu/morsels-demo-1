Treatment.--Mature subjects ought to be put in slings and kept so  restrained throughout the entire time of treatment. Immobilization of  the broken parts of the bone is the object sought. This is attempted by  practitioners who employ various methods, and each method has its  advocates.    Casts are used by some and serve very well in many cases; but because of  their bulk and unyielding and rigid nature, they are not well adapted to  use on fractures of bones proximal to the carpus and tarsus. This is in  reference to plaster-of-paris casts or those of any similar material.    Appliances which depend on glue or other adhesive substances combined  with leather, wood or fiber for their support, are efficacious but not  comfortable.    The use of heavy leather when the member has been suitably padded with  cotton and bandages, constitutes a very good manner of reducing fracture  of the radius or of the tibia. Leather when cut to fit both the medial  and lateral sides of a leg, and firmly held with bandages, will form a  firm support that yields slightly to changes of position, thus making  for comfort of the subject.    Such a splint or support should extend from the fetlock region to the  elbow, but the cotton and bandages are to reach to the foot. When one  considers that, with the supportive appliance placed on each side of the  affected member, rigidity is accomplished as much from tensile strain  put upon the leather as from its own stiffness, it is seen that the  leather need not be of the heaviest--sole leather is unnecessary.  Because of the more comfortable immobilizing appliance, the subject is  less restive, and chances for a successful outcome are materially  increased thereby.    In the mature subject, six or eight weeks' time is required for union of  the parts to occur sufficiently so that splints may be dispensed with.  Rearrangement of the supportive apparatus, however, is possible and  usually necessary during the first few weeks of treatment. By employing  care in handling the parts, the subject will be unlikely to do itself  injury at the time readjustment of splints is being effected.    In foals, it is best to give them the run of a box stall with the  mother. Being agile, they get up and lie at will without doing injury to  the fractured member. The splints (leather is preferable in these cases  also) are looked after and readjusted as necessity demands.    Three or four weeks time is all that is required for the average young  colt to be kept in splints when suffering from simple transverse  fracture of the radius.    Compound fractures are necessarily more difficult to treat than are the  simple variety, but even in such cases recovery results sometimes, and  the practitioner is justified in attempting treatment after having  explained the situation to his client.    Oblique fractures, even when simple, do not completely recover. Muscular  and tendinous contraction, together with the natural tendency for the  beveled contacting parts of the broken bone to pass one another in  oblique fracture, results in shortening of the leg and, if union  results, a large callus usually forms. Where shortening of bones occur,  necessarily, permanent lameness follows.      Wounds of the Anterior Brachial Region.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Contusions and lacerations of the forearm  are of frequent occurrence in horses and are troublesome cases to  handle; particularly is this noticeable where extensive laceration of  the parts occurs. These injuries are caused by animals being kicked; by  striking the forearm against bars in jumping; and in sections of the  country where barbed wire is used to enclose pastures, extensive  lacerated wounds are met with when horses jump into such fences.    Symptomatology.--Any wound which causes inflammation of the structures  of the anterior half of the forearm, is characterized by  swinging-leg-lameness. Depending upon the nature and extent of the  injury, manifestation varies. In cases where laceration has practically  divided all of the substance of the extensor tendons, it is, of course,  impossible for the subject to advance the leg; but where lacerated  wounds involve only a part of the extensor apparatus of the foreleg, not  so much inconvenience is evident, unless the wound is seriously infected  and inflammation involves contiguous structures. Therefore, in many  instances, lameness is more pronounced in contusions of the anterior  brachial region than where tissues have been divided more or less  keenly.    In every instance diagnosis is easily established. The injury is quite  evident, and the manner of locomotion is not in itself an essential  feature to be considered in a discussion of symptoms. Where a contusion  of the anterior brachial structures occurs, there is, in addition to  lameness, swelling which is painful because of the pressure occasioned  by the heavy non-yielding brachial fascia. And where suppuration occurs,  there is then an intensely painful condition which is not relieved until  pus has been evacuated. Rather frequently, drainage for wound secretions  is a difficult problem, and approximation of the divided ends of muscles  is always difficult to maintain.    Treatment.--Contused wounds of the anterior brachial region are  treated along usual lines; that is, attempt is made to stimulate prompt  resolution. Hot or cold applications are employed throughout the acute  stage of the affection. Complete rest is provided for until all pain has  subsided. Later, stimulating liniments are beneficial.    Where no injury is done the periosteum or bone, complete resorption of  all products of inflammation usually occurs, though in many instances,  this is tardy--six weeks or more are sometimes required for recovery to  take place.    If suppuration occurs, it is necessary to provide for drainage as soon  as it is possible to distinguish the presence of pus. Due regard is  given the manner of establishing drainage because of the usual existence  of sub-fascial fistulae. In these cases, one avoids injecting solutions  of aqueous antiseptics. By gently compressing the parts, pus is caused  to drain out and in enforcing a moderate amount of exercise at a walk,  when lameness is not intense, drainage is maintained. Cotton packs,  moistened with hot antiseptic solutions, and kept around the forearm for  several hours daily, are helpful because drainage is facilitated, and  resolution is stimulated by the increase of blood thus attracted to the  parts, and pain materially diminishes.    In lacerated wounds of the anterior brachial region, after having  controlled hemorrhage, an area around the wound margin is freed of hair  by clipping or shaving. The wound is carefully examined, and the best  site for drainage is selected and a suitable opening for wound discharge  is provided for. Where the extensor carpiradialis (metacarpi magnus)  with other structures, is divided and the distal portion is torn  downward, as frequently is the case in barbed wire cuts, it is  necessary to make careful provision for drainage. The wound is  thoroughly cleansed by means of ablutions if necessary; but preferably  by swabbing with pledgets of cotton or gauze which are moistened in  antiseptic solutions. All shreds of macerated tissue are clipped with  scissors and finally the whole wound surface is painted with tincture of  iodin.    If drainage is made by cutting through the tissues in the median portion  of the structures that have been displaced, the opening should be packed  with gauze so that it may remain patent after swelling has occurred.  Such packing is left _in situ_ for twenty-four hours.    The pendant muscular portions of tissues are sutured up by means of  tapes and, while perfect apposition is not ordinarily possible, it is  very essential to train the pendant tissues in their normal position  even if they require resuturing within a week. This minimizes  granulation of tissue, and there results less scar if the detached  portions are kept near, even if not in contact with the proximal wound  margins. The skin together with subcutaneous fascia is sutured on either  side unless drainage is to be provided for on one side, and the  lowermost part of that side is left unsutured.    After-care.--Where extensive suturing of tissues has been necessary,  subjects must be kept quiet. They are best confined in box stalls and  not taken out for several weeks. Particularly is this true where  transverse division of extensors has taken place. Sutures are removed at  the end of from ten days to three weeks as cases permit. Drainage of  wound secretions, which usually become infected, is necessary, because  with obstructed drainage in an infected wound of this kind, there will  result an early destruction of tissue at some point sutured. Daily  irrigation done in a manner that practical asepsis is carried out, is  necessary for about a week. All irrigation is done by way of the  drainage opening, and this with warm aqueous solutions of suitable  antiseptics. After a week or ten days' time, the wound should not be  dressed more frequently than twice weekly.    If it is necessary to leave a portion of the wound uncovered, as in  cases where skin is destroyed, the frequent (three or four daily)  application of a suitable antiseptic powder is necessary to check  exuberant granulation. This may be directly effected by the use of an  astringent or desiccant preparation, and such dressing serves as a  mechanical protection as well.    When such wounds are kept clean, where drainage is properly maintained,  and the subject kept quiet, no particular attention other than the local  application of an astringent lotion (such as the zinc and lead lotion)  is necessary after the first three or four weeks.

Of its remedial  qualities we can say nothing, such matter being irrelevant to the  purpose of this book. Considered, however, as a perfume, with the public  taste it ranks very high; and although it is exceedingly volatile and  evanescent, yet it has that excellent quality which is called  \"refreshing.\" Whether this be due to the rosemary or to the spirit, we  cannot say, but think something may be attributed to both. One important  thing relating to Eau de Cologne must not, however, pass unnoticed, and  that is, the quality of the spirit used in its manufacture. The utter  impossibility of making brandy with English spirit in any way to  resemble the real Cognac, is well known. It is equally impossible to  make Eau de Cologne with English spirit, to resemble the original  article. To speak of the \"purity\" of French spirit, or of the \"impurity\"  of English spirit, is equally absurd. The fact is, that spirit derived  from grapes, and spirit obtained from corn, have each so distinct and  characteristic an aroma, that the one cannot be mistaken for the other.  The odor of grape spirit is said to be due to the oeanthic ether which  it contains. The English spirit, on the other hand, owes its odor to  fusel oil. So powerful is the oeanthic ether in the French spirit,  that notwithstanding the addition to it of such intensely odoriferous  substances as the ottos of neroli, rosemary, and others, it still gives  a characteristic perfume to the products made containing it, and hence  the difficulty of preparing Eau de Cologne with any spirit destitute of  this substance.    Although very fine Eau de Cologne is often made by merely mixing the  ingredients as indicated in the recipe as above, yet it is better,  first, to mix all the citrine ottos with spirit, and then to distil the  mixture, afterwards adding to the distillate the rosemary and nerolies,  such process being the one adopted by the most popular house at Cologne.    A great many forms for the manufacture of Eau de Cologne have been  published, the authors of some of the recipes evidently having no  knowledge, in a practical sense, of what they were putting by theory on  paper; other venturers, to show their lore, have searched out all the  aromatics of Lindley's Botany, and would persuade us to use absinthe,  hyssop, anise, juniper, marjoram, caraway, fennel, cumin, cardamom,  cinnamon, nutmeg, serpolet, angelica, cloves, lavender, camphor, balm,  peppermint, galanga, lemon thyme, &c. &c. &c.    All these, however, are but hum--! Where it is a mere matter of profit,  and the formula that we have given is too expensive to produce the  article required, it is better to dilute the said Cologne with a weak  spirit, or with rose-water, rather than otherwise alter its form;  because, although weak, the true aroma of the original article is  retained.    The recipe of the second quality of Eau de Cologne is given, to show  that a very decent article can be produced with English spirit.    FLOWERS OF ERIN.
