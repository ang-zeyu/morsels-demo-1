Bold spirits began to use the rights of  individual thought in opposition to the authority of established  doctrines; and others, without dreaming of opposing, strove at any rate  to understand, which is the way to produce discussion.  Activity and  freedom of thought were receiving development at the same time that  fervent faith and fervent piety were.    This great moral movement of humanity in the eleventh and twelfth  centuries arose from events very different in different parts of the  beautiful country which was not yet, but was from that time forward  tending to become, France.  Amongst these events, which cannot be here  recounted in detail, we will fix upon two, which were the most striking,  and the most productive of important consequences in the whole history of  the epoch, the quarrel of Abelard with St. Bernard and the crusade  against the Albigensians.  We shall there see how Northern France and  Southern France differed one from the other before the bloody crisis  which was to unite them in one single name and one common destiny.    In France properly so called at that time, north of the Rhone and the  Loire, the church had herself accomplished the chief part of the reforms  which had become necessary.  It was there that the most active and most  eloquent of the reforming monks had appeared, had preached, and had  founded or regenerated a great number of monasteries.  It was there that,  at first amongst the clergy, and then, through their example, amongst the  laity, Christian discipline and morals had resumed some sway.  There,  too, the Christian faith and church were, amongst the mass of the  population, but little or not at all assailed; heretics, when any  appeared, obtained support neither from princes nor people; they were  proceeded against, condemned, and burned, without their exciting public  sympathy by their presence, or public commiseration by their punishment.  It was in the very midst of the clergy themselves, amongst literates and  teachers, that, in Northern France, the intellectual and innovating  movement of the period was manifested and concentrated.  The movement was  vigorous and earnest, and it was a really studious host which thronged to  the lessons of Abelard at Paris, on Mount St. Genevieve, at Melun, at  Corbeil, and at the Paraclete; but this host contained but few of the  people; the greater part of those who formed it were either already in  the church, or soon, in various capacities, about to be.  And the  discussions raised at the meetings corresponded with the persons  attending them; there was the disputation of the schools; there was no  founding of sects; the lessons of Abelard and the questions he handled  were scientifico-religious; it was to expound and propagate what they  regarded as the philosophy of Christianity, that masters and pupils made  bold use of the freedom of thought; they made but slight war upon the  existing practical abuses of the church; they differed from her in the  interpretation and comments contained in some of her dogmas; and they  considered themselves in a position to explain and confirm faith by  reason.  The chiefs of the church, with St. Bernard at their head, were  not slow to descry, in these interpretations and comments based upon  science, danger to the simple and pure faith of the Christian; they saw  the apparition of dawning rationalism confronting orthodoxy.  They were,  as all their contemporaries were, wholly strangers to the bare notion of  freedom of thought and conscience, and they began a zealous struggle  against the new teachers; but they did not push it to the last cruel  extremities.  They had many a handle against Abelard: his private life,  the scandal of his connection with Heloise, the restless and haughty  fickleness of his character, laid him open to severe strictures; but his  stern adversaries did not take so much advantage of them as they might  have taken.  They had his doctrines condemned at the councils of Soissons  and Sens; they prohibited him from public lecturing; and they imposed  upon him the seclusion of the cloister; but they did not even harbor the  notion of having him burned as a heretic, and science and glory were  respected in his person, even when his ideas were proscribed.  Peter the  Venerable, Abbot of Cluni, one of the most highly considered and honored  prelates of the church, received him amongst his own monks, and treated  him with paternal kindness, taking care of his health, as well as of his  eternal welfare; and he who was the adversary of St. Bernard and the  teacher condemned by the councils of Soissons and Sens, died peacefully,  on the 21st of April, 1142, in the abbey of St. Marcellus, near  Chalon-sur-Saone, after having received the sacraments with much piety,  and in presence of all the brethren of the monastery.  \"Thus,\" wrote  Peter the Venerable to Heloise, abbess for eleven years past of the  Paraclete, \"the man who, by his singular authority in science, was known  to nearly all the world, and was illustrious wherever he was known,  learned, in the school of Him who said, 'Know that I am meek and lowly of  heart,' to remain meek and lowly; and, as it is but right to believe, he  has thus returned to Him.\"    The struggle of Abelard with the Church of Northern France and the  crusade against the Albigensians in Southern France are divided by much  more than diversity and contrast; there is an abyss between them.  In  their religious condition, and in the nature as well as degree of their  civilization, the populations of the two regions were radically  different.  In the north-east, between the Rhine, the Scheldt, and the  Loire, Christianity had been obliged to deal with little more than the  barbarism and ignorance of the German conquerors.  In the south, on the  two banks of the Rhone and the Garonne, along the Mediterranean, and by  the Pyrenees, it had encountered all manner of institutions, traditions,  religions, and disbeliefs, Greek, Roman, African, Oriental, Pagan, and  Mussulman; the frequent invasions and long stay of the Saracens in those  countries had mingled Arab blood with the Gallic, Roman, Asiatic, and  Visigothic, and this mixture of so many different races, tongues, creeds,  and ideas had resulted in a civilization more developed, more elegant,  more humane, and more liberal, but far less coherent, simple, and strong,  morally as well as politically, than the warlike, feudal civilization of  Germanic France.  In the religious order especially, the dissimilarity  was profound.  In Northern France, in spite of internal disorder, and  through the influence of its bishops, missionaries, and monastic  reformers, the orthodox Church had obtained a decided superiority and  full dominion; but in Southern France, on the contrary, all the  controversies, all the sects, and all the mystical or philosophical  heresies which had disturbed Christendom from the second century to the  ninth, had crept in and spread abroad.  In it there were Arians,  Manicheans, Gnostics, Paulicians, Cathars (the pure), and other sects of  more local or more recent origin and name, Albigensians, Vaudians, Good  People and Poor of Lyons, some piously possessed with the desire of  returning to the pure faith and fraternal organization of the primitive  evangelical Church, others given over to the extravagances of imagination  or asceticism.  The princes and the great laic lords of the country, the  Counts of Toulouse, Foix, and Comminges, the Viscount of Beziers, and  many others had not remained unaffected by this condition of the people:  the majority were accused of tolerating and even protecting the heretics;  and some were suspected of allowing their ideas to penetrate within their  own households.  The bold sallies of the critical and jeering spirit, and  the abandonment of established creeds and discipline, bring about, before  long, a relaxation of morals; and liberty requires long time and many  trials before it learns to disavow and rise superior to license.  In many  of the feudal courts and castles of Languedoc, Provence, and Aquitaine,  imaginations, words, and lives were licentious; and the charming poetry  of the troubadours and the gallant adventures of knights caused it to be  too easily forgotten that morality was but little more regarded than the  faith.  Dating from the latter half of the eleventh century, not only the  popes, but the whole orthodox Church of France and its spiritual heads,  were seriously disquieted at the state of mind of Southern France, and  the dangers it threatened to the whole of Christendom.  In 1145  St. Bernard, in all the lustre of his name and influence, undertook, in  concert with Cardinal Alberic, legate of the Pope Eugenius III., to go  and preach against the heretics in the countship of Toulouse.  \"We see  here,\" he wrote to Alphonse Jourdain, Count of Toulouse, \"churches  without flocks, flocks without priests, priests without the respect which  is their due, and Christians without Christ; men die in their sins  without being reconciled by penance or admitted to the holy communion;  souls are sent pell-mell before the awful tribunal of God; the grace of  baptism is refused to little children; those to whom the Lord said,  'Suffer little children to come unto Me,' do not obtain the means of  coming to salvation.  Is it because of a belief that these little  children have no need of the Saviour, inasmuch as they are little?  Is it  then for nought that our Lord from being great became little?  What say  I?  Is it then for nought that He was scourged and spat upon, crucified  and dead?\"  St. Bernard preached with great success in Toulouse itself,  but he was not satisfied with easy successes.  He had come to fight the  heretics; and he went to look for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#18)"],[1,"vais, who nine years afterwards was to sentence  Joan of Arc to be burned], he stoutly replied, \"Never was English king of  France, and never shall be.\"  The country had no mind to believe in the  conquest it was undergoing; and the Duke of Burgundy, the most puissant  ally of the English, sulkily went on eluding the consequences of the  anti-national alliance he had accepted.    Such being the disposition of conquerors and conquered, the war, though  still carried on with great spirit, could not, and in fact did not, bring  about any decisive result from 1422 to 1429.  Towns were alternately  taken, lost, and retaken, at one time by the French, at another by the  English or Burgundians; petty encounters and even important engagements  took place with vicissitudes of success and reverses on both sides.  At  Crevant-sur-Yonne, on the 31st of July, 1423, and at Verneuil, in  Normandy, on the 17th of August, 1424, the French were beaten, and their  faithful allies, the Scots, suffered considerable loss.  In the latter  affair, however, several Norman lords deserted the English flag, refusing  to fight against the King of France.  On the 26th of September, 1423, at  La Gravelle, in Maine, the French were victorious, and Du Guesclin was  commemorated in their victory.  Anne de Laval, granddaughter of the great  Breton warrior, and mistress of a castle hard by the scene of action,  sent thither her son, Andrew de Laval, a child twelve years of age, and,  as she buckled with her own hands the sword which his ancestor had worn,  she said to him, \"God make thee as valiant as he whose sword this was!\"  The boy received the order of knighthood on the field of battle, and  became afterwards a marshal of France.  Little bands, made up of  volunteers, attempted enterprises which the chiefs of the regular armies  considered impossible.  Stephen de Vignolles, celebrated under the name  of La Hire, resolved to succor the town of Montargis, besieged by the  English; and young Dunois, the bastard of Orleans, joined him.  On  arriving, September 5, 1427, beneath the walls of the place, a priest was  encountered in their road.  La Hire asked him for absolution.  The priest  told him to confess.  \"I have no time for that,\" said La Hire; \"I am in a  hurry; I have done in the way of sins all that men of war are in the  habit of doing.\"  Whereupon, says the chronicler, the chaplain gave him  absolution for what it was worth; and La Hire, putting his hands  together, said, \"God, I pray Thee to do for La Hire this day as much as  Thou wouldst have La Hire do for Thee if he were God and Thou wert La  Hire.\"  And Montargis was rid of its besiegers.  The English determined  to become masters of Mont St. Michel au peril de la mer, that abbey built  on a rock facing the western coast of Normandy and surrounded every day  by the waves of ocean.  The thirty-second abbot, Robert Jolivet, promised  to give the place up to them, and went to Rouen with that design; but one  of his monks, John Enault, being elected vicar-general by the chapter,  and supported by some valiant Norman warriors, offered an obstinate  resistance for eight years, baffled all the attacks of the English, and  retained the abbey in the possession of the King of France.  The  inhabitants of La Rochelle rendered the same service to the king and to  France in a more important case.  On the 15th of August, 1427, an English  fleet of a hundred and twenty sail, it is said, appeared off their city  with invading troops aboard.  The Rochellese immediately levied upon  themselves an extraordinary tax, and put themselves in a state of  defence; troops raised in the neighborhood went and occupied the heights  bordering on the coast; and a bold Breton sailor, Bernard de Kercabin,  put to sea to meet the enemy, with ships armed as privateers.  The  attempt of the English seemed to them to offer more danger than chance of  success; and they withdrew.  Thus Charles VII. kept possession of the  only seaport remaining to the crown.  Almost everywhere in the midst of a  war as indecisive as it was obstinate local patriotism and the spirit of  chivalry successfully disputed against foreign supremacy the scattered  fragments of the fatherland and the throne.    In order to put an end to this doubtful condition of events and of minds,  the Duke of Bedford determined to aim a grand blow at the national party  in France and at her king.  After Paris and Rouen, Orleans was the most  important city in the kingdom; it was as supreme on the banks of the  Loire as Paris and Rouen were on those of the Seine.  After having  obtained from England considerable re-enforcements commanded by leaders  of experience, the English commenced, in October, 1428, the siege of  Orleans.  The approaches to the place were occupied in force, and  bastilles closely connected one with another were constructed around the  walls.  As a set-off, the most valiant warriors of France, La Hire,  Dunois, Xaintrailles, and the Marshal La Fayette threw themselves into  Orleans, the garrison of which amounted to scarcely twelve hundred men.  Several towns, Bourges, Poitiers, and La Rochelle, sent thither money,  munitions, and militia; the states-general, assembled at Chinon, voted an  extraordinary aid; and Charles VII. called out the regulars and the  reserves.  Assaults on the one side and sorties on the other were begun  with ardor.  Besiegers and besieged quite felt that they were engaged in  a decisive struggle.  The first encounter was unfortunate for the  Orleannese.  In a fight called the Herring affair, they were unsuccessful  in an attempt to carry off a supply of victuals and salt fish which Sir  John Falstolf was bringing to the besiegers.  Being a little discouraged,  they offered the Duke of Burgundy to place their city in his hands, that  it might not fall into those of the English; and Philip the Good accepted  the offer, but the Duke of Bedford made a formal objection: \"He didn't  care,\" he said, \"to beat the bushes for another to get the birds.\"  Philip in displeasure withdrew from the siege the small force of  Burgundians he had sent.  The English remained alone before the place,  which was every day harder pressed and more strictly blockaded.  The  besieged were far from foreseeing what succor was preparing for them.    This very year, on the 6th of January, 1428, at Domremy, a little village  in the valley of the Meuse, between Neufchateau and Vaucouleurs, on the  edge of the frontier from Champagne to Lorraine, the young daughter of  simple tillers of the soil, \"of good life and repute, herself a good,  simple, gentle girl, no idler, occupied hitherto in sewing or spinning  with her mother, or driving afield her parent's sheep, and sometimes,  even, when her father's turn came round, keeping for him the whole flock  of the commune,\" was fulfilling her sixteenth year.  It was Joan of Arc,  whom all her neighbors called Joannette.  She was no recluse; she often  went with her companions to sing and eat cakes beside the fountain by the  gooseberry-bush, under an old beech, which was called the fairy-tree: but  dancing she did not like.  She was constant at church, she delighted in  the sound of the bells, she went often to confession and communion, and  she blushed when her fair friends taxed her with being too religious.  In  1421, when Joan was hardly nine, a band of Anglo-Burgundians penetrated  into her country, and transferred thither the ravages of war.  The  village of Domremy and the little town of Vaucouleurs were French, and  faithful to the French king-ship; and Joan wept to see the lads of her  parish returning bruised and bleeding from encounters with the enemy.  Her relations and neighbors were one day obliged to take to flight, and  at their return they found their houses burned or devastated.  Joan  wondered whether it could possibly be that God permitted such excesses  and disasters.  In 1425, on a summer's day, at noon, she was in her  father's little garden.  She heard a voice calling her, at her right  side, in the direction of the church, and a great brightness shone upon  her at the same time in the same spot.  At first she was frightened, but  she recovered herself on finding that \"it was a worthy voice;\" and, at  the second call, she perceived that it was the voice of angels.  \"I saw  them with my bodily eyes,\" she said, six years later, to her judges at  Rouen, \"as plainly as I see you; when they departed from me I wept, and  would fain have had them take me with them.\"  The apparitions came again  and again, and exhorted her \"to go to France for to deliver the kingdom.\"  She became dreamy, rapt in constant meditation.  \"I could endure no  longer,\" said she, at a later period, \"and the time went heavily with me  as with a woman in travail.\"  She ended by telling everything to her  father, who listened to her words anxiously at first, and afterwards  wrathfully.  He himself one night dreamed that his daughter had followed  the king's men-at-arms to France, and from that moment he kept her under  strict superintendence.  \"If I knew of your sister's going,\" he said to  his sons, \"I would bid you drown her; and, if you did not do it, I would  drown her myself.\"  Joan submitted: there was no leaven of pride in her  sublimation, and she did not suppose that her intercourse with celestial  voices relieved her from the duty of obeying her parents.  Attempts were  made to distract her mind.  A young man who had courted her was induced  to say that he had a promise of marriage from her, and to claim the  fulfilment of it.  Joan went before the ecclesiastical judge, made  affirmation that she had given no promise, and without difficulty gained  her cause.  Everybody believed and respected her.
