Scarce one of their traditions - except the  beautiful one respecting the founders of their royal dynasty - is  worthy of note, or throws much light on their own antiquities, or  the primitive history of man.  Among the traditions of importance  is one of the deluge, which they held in common with so many of  the nations in all parts of the globe, and which they related  with some particulars that bear resemblance to a Mexican legend.  *1    [Footnote 1: They related, that, after the deluge, seven persons  issued from a cave where they had saved themselves, and by them  the earth was repeopled. One of the traditions of the Mexicans  deduced their descent, and that of the kindred tribes, in like  manner, from seven persons who came from as many caves in Aztlan.  (Conf. Acosta, lib. 6, cap. 19; lib. 7, cap. 2. - Ondegardo, Rel.  Prim., Ms.) The story of the deluge is told by different writers  with many variations, in some of which it is not difficult to  detect the plastic hand of the Christian convert.]    Their ideas in respect to a future state of being deserve more  attention. They admitted the existence of the soul hereafter, and  connected with this a belief in the resurrection of the body.  They assigned two distinct places for the residence of the good  and of the wicked, the latter of which they fixed in the centre  of the earth.  The good they supposed were to pass a luxurious  life of tranquillity and ease, which comprehended their highest  notions of happiness.  The wicked were to expiate their crimes by  ages of wearisome labor.  They associated with these ideas a  belief in an evil principle or spirit, bearing the name of Cupay,  whom they did not attempt to propitiate by sacrifices, and who  seems to have been only a shadowy personification of sin, that  exercised little influence over their conduct. *2    [Footnote 2: Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms. - Gomara, Hist. de las  Ind., cap. 123. - Garcilasso, Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 2, cap.  2, 7.    One might suppose that the educated Peruvians - if I may so speak  - imagined the common people had no souls, so little is said of  their opinions as to the condition of these latter in a future  life, while they are diffuse on the prospects of the higher  orders, which they fondly believed were to keep pace with their  condition here.]    It was this belief in the resurrection of the body, which led  them to preserve the body with so much solicitude, - by a simple  process, however, that, unlike the elaborate embalming of the  Egyptians, consisted in exposing it to the action of the cold,  exceedingly dry, and highly rarefied atmosphere of the mountains.  *3 As they believed that the occupations in the future world  would have great resemblance to those of the present, they buried  with the deceased noble some of his apparel, his utensils, and,  frequently, his treasures; and completed the gloomy ceremony by  sacrificing his wives and favorite domestics, to bear him company  and do him service in the happy regions beyond the clouds. *4  Vast mounds of an irregular, or, more frequently, oblong shape,  penetrated by galleries running at right angles to each other,  were raised over the dead, whose dried bodies or mummies have  been found in considerable numbers, sometimes erect, but more  often in the sitting posture, common to the Indian tribes of both  continents.  Treasures of great value have also been occasionally  drawn from these monumental deposits, and have stimulated  speculators to repeated excavations with the hope of similar  good-fortune.  It was a lottery like that of searching after  mines, but where the chances have proved still more against the  adventurers. *5    [Footnote 3: Such, indeed, seems to be the opinion of Garcilasso,  though some writers speak of resinous and other applications for  embalming the body.  The appearance of the royal mummies found at  Cuzco, as reported both by Ondegardo and Garcilasso, makes it  probable that no foreign substance was employed for their  preservation.]    [Footnote 4: Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms    The Licentiate says, that this usage continued even after the  Conquest; and that he had saved the life of more than one  favorite domestic, who had fled to him for protection, as they  were about to be sacrificed to the Manes of their deceased lords.  Ibid., ubi supra.]    [Footnote 5: Yet these sepulchral mines have sometimes proved  worth the digging.  Sarmiento speaks of gold to the value of  100,000 castellanos, as occasionally buried with the Indian  lords; (Relacion, Ms., cap. 57;) and Las Casas - not the best  authority in numerical estimates - says that treasures worth more  than half a million of ducats had been found, within twenty years  after the Conquest, in the tombs near Truxillo.  (Oeuvres, ed.  par Llorente, (Paris, 1822,) tom. II. p. 192.) Baron Humboldt  visited the sepulchre of a Peruvian prince in the same quarter of  the country, whence a Spaniard in 1576 drew forth a mass of gold  worth a million of dollars!  Vues des Cordilleres, p. 29.]    The Peruvians, like so may other of the Indian races,  acknowledged a Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of the  Universe, whom they adored under the different names of  Pachacamac and Viracocha. *6 No temple was raised to this  invisible Being, save one only in the valley which took its name  from the deity himself, not far from the Spanish city of Lima.  Even this temple had existed there before the country came under  the sway of the Incas, and was the great resort of Indian  pilgrims from remote parts of the land; a circumstance which  suggests the idea, that the worship of this Great Spirit, though  countenanced, perhaps, by their accommodating policy, did not  originate with the Peruvian princes. *7    [Footnote 6: Pachacamac signifies \"He who sustains or gives life  to the universe.\" The name of the great deity is sometimes  expressed by both Pachacamac and Viracocha combined.  (See  Balboa, Hist. du Perou, chap. 6. - Acosta, lib. 6, cap. 21.) An  old Spaniard finds in the popular meaning of Viracocha, \"foam of  the sea,\" an argument for deriving the Peruvian civilization from  some voyager from the Old World.  Conq. i Pob. de. Piru, Ms.]    [Footnote 7: Pedro Pizarro, Descub. y Conq. Ms. - Sarmiento,  Relacion, Ms., cap. 27.    Ulloa notices the extensive ruins of brick, which mark the  probable site of the temple of Pachacamac, attesting by their  present appearance its ancient magnificence and strength.  Memoires Philosophiques, Historiques, Physiques, (Paris, 1787,)  trad. Fr., p. 78.]    The deity whose worship they especially inculcated, and which  they never failed to establish wherever their banners were known  to penetrate, was the Sun.  It was he, who, in a particular  manner, presided over the destinies of man; gave light and warmth  to the nations, and life to the vegetable world; whom they  reverenced as the father of their royal dynasty, the founder of  their empire; and whose temples rose in every city and almost  every village throughout the land, while his altars smoked with  burnt offerings, - a form of sacrifice peculiar to the Peruvians  among the semi-civilized nations of the New World. *8    [Footnote 8: At least, so says Dr. McCulloh; and no better  authority can be required on American antiquities.  (Researches,  p. 392.) Might he not have added barbarous nations. also?]    Besides the Sun, the Incas acknowledged various objects of  worship in some way or other connected with this principal deity.  Such was the Moon, his sister-wife; the Stars, revered as part of  her heavenly train, - though the fairest of them, Venus, known to  the Peruvians by the name of Chasca, or the \"youth with the long  and curling locks,\" was adored as the page of the Sun, whom he  attends so closely in his rising and in his setting.  They  dedicated temples also to the Thunder and Lightning, *9 in whom  they recognized the Sun's dread ministers, and to the Rainbow,  whom they worshipped as a beautiful emanation of their glorious  deity. *10    [Footnote 9: Thunder, Lightning, and Thunderbolt, could be all  expressed by the Peruvians in one word, Illapa.  Hence some  Spaniards have inferred a knowledge of the Trinity in the  natives!  \"The Devil stole all he could,\" exclaims Herrera, with  righteous indignation.  (Hist. General, dec. 5, lib. 4, cap. 5.)  These, and even rasher conclusions, (see Acosta, lib. 5, cap.  28,) are scouted by Garcilasso, as inventions of Indian converts,  willing to please the imaginations of their Christian teachers.  (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 2, cap. 5, 6; lib. 3, cap. 21.)  Imposture, on the one hand, and credulity on the other, have  furnished a plentiful harvest of absurdities, which has been  diligently gathered in by the pious antiquary of a later  generation.]    [Footnote 10: Garcilasso's assertion, that these heavenly bodies  were objects of reverence as holy things, but not of worship,  (Com. Real., Parte 1, lib. 2, cap. 1, 23,) is contradicted by  Ondegardo, Rel. Seg., Ms., - Dec. de la Aud. Real., Ms., -  Herrera, Hist. General, dec. 5, lib. 4, cap. 4, - Gomara, Hist.  de las Ind., cap. 121, - and, I might add, by almost every writer  of authority whom I have consulted.  It is contradicted, in a  manner, by the admission of Garcilasso himself, that these  several objects were all personified by the Indians as living  beings, and had temples dedicated to them as such, with their  effigies delineated in the same manner as was that of the Sun in  his dwelling.  Indeed, the effort of the historian to reduce the  worship of the Incas to that of the Sun alone is not very  reconcilable with what he else where says of the homage paid to  Pachacamac, above all, and to Rimac, the great oracle of the  common people.  The Peruvian mythology was, probably, not unlike  that of Hindostan, where, under two, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13240"],[0,"A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature (#18)"],[1," Essay on  Mind and Other Poems_. Shortly afterwards the abolition of slavery, of  which he had been a disinterested supporter, considerably reduced Mr.  B.'s means: he accordingly disposed of his estate and removed with his  family first to Sidmouth and afterwards to London. At the former Miss B.  wrote _Prometheus Bound_ (1835). After her removal to London she fell  into delicate health, her lungs being threatened. This did not, however,  interfere with her literary labours, and she contributed to various  periodicals _The Romaunt of Margaret_, _The Romaunt of the Page_, _The  Poet's Vow_, and other pieces. In 1838 appeared _The Seraphim and Other  Poems_ (including \"Cowper's Grave.\") Shortly thereafter the death, by  drowning, of her favourite brother gave a serious shock to her already  fragile health, and for a time she hovered between life and death.  Eventually, however, she regained strength, and meanwhile her fame was  growing. The _pub._ about 1841 of _The Cry of the Children_ gave it a  great impulse, and about the same time she contributed some critical  papers in prose to R.H. Horne's _New Spirit of the Age_. In 1844 she  _pub._ two vols. of _Poems_, which comprised \"The Drama of Exile,\"  \"Vision of Poets,\" and \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship.\" In 1845 she met for  the first time her future husband, Robert Browning (_q.v._). Their  courtship and marriage, owing to her delicate health and the  extraordinary objections entertained by Mr. B. to the marriage of any of  his children, were carried out under somewhat peculiar and romantic  circumstances. After a private marriage and a secret departure from her  home, she accompanied her husband to Italy, which became her home almost  continuously until her death, and with the political aspirations of which  she and her husband both thoroughly identified themselves. The union  proved one of unalloyed happiness to both, though it was never forgiven  by Mr. Barrett. In her new circumstances her strength greatly increased.  Her husband and she settled in Florence, and there she wrote _Casa Guidi  Windows_ (1851)--by many considered her strongest work--under the  inspiration of the Tuscan struggle for liberty. _Aurora Leigh_, her  largest, and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems, appeared in  1856. In 1850 _The Sonnets from the Portuguese_--the history of her own  love-story, thinly disguised by its title--had appeared. In 1860 she  issued a _coll._ ed. of her poems under the title, _Poems before  Congress_. Soon thereafter her health underwent a change for the worse;  she gradually lost strength, and _d._ on June 29, 1861. She is generally  considered the greatest of English poetesses. Her works are full of  tender and delicate, but also of strong and deep, thought. Her own  sufferings, combined with her moral and intellectual strength, made her  the champion of the suffering and oppressed wherever she found them. Her  gift was essentially lyrical, though much of her work was not so in form.  Her weak points are the lack of compression, an occasional somewhat  obtrusive mannerism, and frequent failure both in metre and rhyme. Though  not nearly the equal of her husband in force of intellect and the higher  qualities of the poet, her works had, as might be expected on a  comparison of their respective subjects and styles, a much earlier and  wider acceptance with the general public. Mrs. B. was a woman of singular  nobility and charm, and though not beautiful, was remarkably attractive.  Miss Mitford (_q.v._) thus describes her as a young woman: \"A slight,  delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a  most expressive face; large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark  eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam.\"    _Life_ by J.H. Ingram (1889); _Letters of R. Browning and E.B. Browning_  (1889). _Coll._ ed. of her works, _see_ above.      BROWNING, ROBERT (1812-1889).--Poet, only _s._ of Robert B., a man of  fine intellect and equally fine character, who held a position in the  Bank of England, was _b._ in Camberwell. His mother, to whom he was  ardently attached, was the _dau._ of a German shipowner who had settled  in Dundee, and was alike intellectually and morally worthy of his  affection. The only other member of the family was a younger sister, also  highly gifted, who was the sympathetic companion of his later years. In  his childhood he was distinguished by his love of poetry and natural  history. At 12 he had written a book of poetry which he destroyed when he  could not find a publisher. After being at one or two private schools,  and showing an insuperable dislike to school life, he was _ed._ by a  tutor, and thereafter studied Greek at Univ. Coll., London. Through his  mother he inherited some musical talent, and composed settings, for  various songs. His first _pub._ was _Pauline_, which appeared anonymously  in 1833, but attracted little attention. In 1834 he paid his first visit  to Italy, in which so much of his future life was to be passed. The  publication of _Paracelsus_ in 1835, though the poem had no general  popularity, gained the notice of Carlyle, Wordsworth, and other men of  letters, and gave him a reputation as a poet of distinguished promise.  Two years later his drama of _Stratford_ was performed by his friend  Macready and Helen Faucit, and in 1840 the most difficult and obscure of  his works, _Sordello_, appeared; but, except with a select few, did  little to increase his reputation. It was followed by _Bells and  Pomegranates_ (containing _Pippa Passes_) (1841), _A Blot in the  'Scutcheon_ (drama) (1843), _Luria_ and _A Soul's Tragedy_ (1846). In  this year he married Miss Elizabeth Barrett (_q.v._), the poetess, a  union of ideal happiness. Thereafter his home until his wife's death in  1861 was in Italy, chiefly at Florence. In 1850 he wrote _Christmas Eve  and Easter Day_, and in 1855 appeared _Men and Women_. After the death of  Mrs. Browning he returned to England, paying, however, frequent visits to  Italy. Settling in London he published successively _Dramatis Personae_  (1864), _The Ring and the Book_ (1868-69), his greatest work,  _Balaustion's Adventure_, and _Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau_ (1871),  _Fifine at the Fair_ (1872), _Red Cotton Night-cap Country_ (1873), _The  Inn Album_ (1875), _Pacchiarotto_ (1876), translation of _Agamemnon_  (1879), _La Saisiaz_, etc. (1878), _Dramatic Idylls_ (1879 and 1880),  _Asolando_ (1889) appeared on the day of his death. To the great majority  of readers, probably, B. is best known by some of his short poems, such  as, to name a few, \"Rabbi Ben Ezra,\" \"How they brought the good News to  Aix,\" \"Evelyn Hope,\" \"The Pied Piper of Hammelin,\" \"A Grammarian's  Funeral,\" \"A Death in the Desert.\" It was long before England recognised  that in B. she had received one of the greatest of her poets, and the  causes of this lie on the surface. His subjects were often recondite and  lay beyond the ken and sympathy of the great bulk of readers; and owing,  partly to the subtle links connecting the ideas and partly to his often  extremely condensed and rugged expression, the treatment of them was not  seldom difficult and obscure. Consequently for long he appealed to a  somewhat narrow circle. As time went on, however, and work after work was  added, the circle widened, and the marvellous depth and variety of  thought and intensity of feeling told with increasing force. Societies  began to be formed for the study of the poet's work. Critics became more  and more appreciative, and he at last reaped the harvest of admiration  and honour which was his due. Many distinctions came to him. He was made  LL.D. of Edin., a life Governor of London Univ., and had the offer of the  Lord Rectorship of Glasgow. He _d._ in the house of his son at Venice,  and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The keynote of his teaching is a  wise and noble optimism. His poems were collected in 2 vols. in 1896.  Some vols. of his correspondence with Mrs. B. were also _pub._    Uniform ed. of Works (17 vols. 1888-90); Furnivall's _Browning  Bibliography_ (1883), _Lives_ by Mrs. Sutherland Orr (1891); Gosse  (1890); Dowden (1904), G.K. Chesterton (English Men of Letters), etc.;  _Poetry of Robert Browning_ by Stopford Brooke, 1902, etc.    SUMMARY.--_B._ 1812, _pub._ _Paracelsus_ 1835, _Sordello_ 1840, _Bells  and Pomegranates_ 1841, _m._ to E.B.B. 1846, lives chiefly in Italy till  her _d._, 1861, when he returned to England and continued to write until  his _d._, _pub._ _Dramatis Personae_, _Ring and Book_ 1868-9, _Asolando_  1889, _d._ 1889.      BRUCE, JAMES (1730-1794).--Traveller, was _b._ at the family seat of  Kinnaird, Perthshire, and _ed._ at Harrow. After various travels in  Europe he set out in 1768 on his expedition to Abyssinia, and in 1770  reached the source of the Blue Nile. He returned to England in 1774, and  in 1790 _pub._ his _Travels_ in 5 quarto vols. His notorious vanity, the  singular adventures he related, and the generally embellished character  which he imparted to his narrative excited some degree of scepticism, and  he was subjected to a good deal of satire, to which, though much annoyed,  he did not reply. It is, however, generally allowed that he had shown  great daring, perseverance, and zeal in his explorations, and that he  made a real addition to the geographical knowledge of his day.      BRUCE, MICHAEL (1746-1767).--Poet, _s._ of a poor weaver at Kinnesswood,  Kinross-shire, as a child herded cattle, but received a good education,  including 4 sessions at the Univ. of Edin., and for a short time kept a  school. His longest poem, _Loch Leven_, shows the influence of Thomson.  His best is his _Elegy_. His promising career was cut short by  consumption in 1767. The authorship of the beautiful _Ode to the Cuckoo_  beginning \"Hail, beauteous stranger of the grove\" is contested, some  authorities claiming it for B. and others for the Rev. John Logan  (_q.v._), who ed. B.'s "]]]
