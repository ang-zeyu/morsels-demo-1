Tourism's direct contribution to output in 1994 was  about 20%. In addition, increased tourist arrivals helped spur growth  in the construction and transport sectors. The dual island nation's  agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic market; the  sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages  that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction.  Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major  products being bedding, handicrafts, and electronic components.  Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to  depend on income growth in the industrialized world, especially in the  US, which accounts for about half of all tourist arrivals.

I had never met any of the family and  naturally rather dreaded to have them come, but Mr. Stewart was firm in  wanting to be married at home, so he told Mr. Pearson he wanted him and  his family to come up the following Wednesday and serve papers on the  \"wooman i' the hoose.\" They were astonished, of course, but being such  good friends they promised him all the assistance they could render.  They are quite the dearest, most interesting family! I have since  learned to love them as my own.    Well, there was no time to make wedding clothes, so I had to \"do up\"  what I did have. Isn't it queer how sometimes, do what you can, work  will keep getting in the way until you can't get anything done? That is  how it was with me those few days before the wedding; so much so that  when Wednesday dawned everything was topsy-turvy and I had a very  strong desire to run away. But I always did hate a \"piker,\" so I stood  pat. Well, I had most of the dinner cooked, but it kept me hustling to  get the house into anything like decent order before the old dog  barked, and I knew my moments of liberty were limited. It was blowing a  perfect hurricane and snowing like midwinter. I had bought a beautiful  pair of shoes to wear on that day, but my vanity had squeezed my feet a  little, so while I was so busy at work I had kept on a worn old pair,  intending to put on the new ones later; but when the Pearsons drove up  all I thought about was getting them into the house where there was  fire, so I forgot all about the old shoes and the apron I wore.    I had only been here six weeks then, and was a stranger. That is why I  had no one to help me and was so confused and hurried. As soon as the  newcomers were warm, Mr. Stewart told me I had better come over by him  and stand up. It was a large room I had to cross, and how I did it  before all those strange eyes I never knew. All I can remember very  distinctly is hearing Mr. Stewart saying, \"I will,\" and myself chiming  in that I would, too. Happening to glance down, I saw that I had  forgotten to take off my apron or my old shoes, but just then Mr.  Pearson pronounced us man and wife, and as I had dinner to serve right  away I had no time to worry over my odd toilet. Anyway the shoes were  comfortable and the apron white, so I suppose it could have been  worse; and I don't think it has ever made any difference with the  Pearsons, for I number them all among my most esteemed friends.    It is customary here for newlyweds to give a dance and supper at the  hall, but as I was a stranger I preferred not to, and so it was a long  time before I became acquainted with all my neighbors. I had not  thought I should ever marry again. Jerrine was always such a dear  little pal, and I wanted to just knock about foot-loose and free to see  life as a gypsy sees it. I had planned to see the Cliff-Dwellers' home;  to live right there until I caught the spirit of the surroundings  enough to live over their lives in imagination anyway. I had planned to  see the old missions and to go to Alaska; to hunt in Canada. I even  dreamed of Honolulu. Life stretched out before me one long, happy  jaunt. I aimed to see all the world I could, but to travel unknown  bypaths to do it. But first I wanted to try homesteading.    But for my having the grippe, I should never have come to Wyoming. Mrs.  Seroise, who was a nurse at the institution for nurses in Denver while  I was housekeeper there, had worked one summer at Saratoga, Wyoming. It  was she who told me of the pine forests. I had never seen a pine until  I came to Colorado; so the idea of a home among the pines fascinated  me. At that time I was hoping to pass the Civil-Service examination,  with no very definite idea as to what I would do, but just to be  improving my time and opportunity. I never went to a public school a  day in my life. In my childhood days there was no such thing in the  Indian Territory part of Oklahoma where we lived, so I have had to try  hard to keep learning. Before the time came for the examination I was  so discouraged because of the grippe that nothing but the mountains,  the pines, and the clean, fresh air seemed worth while; so it all came  about just as I have written you.    So you see I was very deceitful. Do you remember, I wrote you of a  little baby boy dying? That was my own little Jamie, our first little  son. For a long time my heart was crushed. He was such a sweet,  beautiful boy. I wanted him so much. He died of erysipelas. I held him  in my arms till the last agony was over. Then I dressed the beautiful  little body for the grave. Clyde is a carpenter; so I wanted him to  make the little coffin. He did it every bit, and I lined and padded it,  trimmed and covered it. Not that we couldn't afford to buy one or that  our neighbors were not all that was kind and willing; but because it  was a sad pleasure to do everything for our little first-born  ourselves.    As there had been no physician to help, so there was no minister to  comfort, and I could not bear to let our baby leave the world without  leaving any message to a community that sadly needed it. His little  message to us had been love, so I selected a chapter from John and we  had a funeral service, at which all our neighbors for thirty miles  around were present. So you see, our union is sealed by love and  welded by a great sorrow.    Little Jamie was the first little Stewart. God has given me two more  precious little sons. The old sorrow is not so keen now. I can bear to  tell you about it, but I never could before. When you think of me, you  must think of me as one who is truly happy. It is true, I want a great  many things I haven't got, but I don't want them enough to be  discontented and not enjoy the many blessings that are mine. I have my  home among the blue mountains, my healthy, well-formed children, my  clean, honest husband, my kind, gentle milk cows, my garden which I  make myself. I have loads and loads of flowers which I tend myself.  There are lots of chickens, turkeys, and pigs which are my own special  care. I have some slow old gentle horses and an old wagon. I can load  up the kiddies and go where I please any time. I have the best, kindest  neighbors and I have my dear absent friends. Do you wonder I am so  happy? When I think of it all, I wonder how I can crowd all my joy into  one short life. I don't want you to think for one moment that you are  bothering me when I write you. It is a real pleasure to do so. You're  always so good to let me tell you everything. I am only afraid of  trying your patience too far. Even in this long letter I can't tell you  all I want to; so I shall write you again soon. Jerrine will write too.  Just now she has very sore fingers. She has been picking gooseberries,  and they have been pretty severe on her brown little paws.    With much love to you, I am      \"Honest and truly\" yours,      ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          XIX    THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE           _January 6, 1913._    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    I have put off writing you and thanking you for your thought for us  until now so that I could tell you of our very happy Christmas and our  deer hunt all at once.    To begin with, Mr. Stewart and Junior have gone to Boulder to spend the  winter. Clyde wanted his mother to have a chance to enjoy our boy, so,  as he had to go, he took Junior with him. Then those of my dear  neighbors nearest my heart decided to prevent a lonely Christmas for  me, so on December 21st came Mrs. Louderer, laden with an immense plum  pudding and a big \"_wurst_,\" and a little later came Mrs. O'Shaughnessy  on her frisky pony, Chief, her scarlet sweater making a bright bit of  color against our snow-wrapped horizon. Her face and ways are just as  bright and cheery as can be. When she saw Mrs. Louderer's pudding and  sausage she said she had brought nothing because she had come to get  something to eat herself, \"and,\" she continued, \"it is a private  opinion of mine that my neighbors are so glad to see me that they are  glad to feed me.\" Now wouldn't that little speech have made her welcome  anywhere?    Well, we were hilariously planning what Mrs. O'Shaughnessy called a  \"widdy\" Christmas and getting supper, when a great stamping-off of snow  proclaimed a newcomer. It was Gavotte, and we were powerfully glad to  see him because the hired man was going to a dance and we knew Gavotte  would contrive some unusual amusement. He had heard that Clyde was  going to have a deer-drive, and didn't know that he had gone, so he had  come down to join the hunt just for the fun, and was very much  disappointed to find there was going to be no hunt. After supper,  however, his good humor returned and he told us story after story of  big hunts he had had in Canada. He worked up his own enthusiasm as well  as ours, and at last proposed that we have a drive of our own for a  Christmas \"joy.\" He said he would take a station and do the shooting if  one of us would do the driving. So right now I reckon I had better tell  you how it is done.    There are many little parks in the mountains where the deer can feed,  although now most places are so deep in snow that they can't walk in  it. For that reason they have trails to water and to the different  feeding-grounds, and they can't get through the snow except along these  paths. You see how easy it would be for a man hidden on the trail to  get one of the beautiful creatures if some one coming from another  direction startled them so that they came along that particular path.    So they made their plans. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy elected herself driver.  Two miles away is a huge mountain called Phillipeco, and deer were  said to be plentiful up there. At one time there had been a sawmill on  the mountain, "]]]
