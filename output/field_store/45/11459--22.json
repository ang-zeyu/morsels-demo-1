[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#18)"],[1," was defended by a force mainly composed of  irregulars; it was encumbered with a large native population; and the  civil and military authorities were not working in harmony.    The defence throughout was more active than the attack. Reconnaissances  and raids against the enemy's positions were made with effect; and the  bombardment which followed a rejected summons to surrender did little  harm. Communication with the outer world was not seriously impeded.  Cattle grazed almost with impunity inside the line of investment and  several thousands of the natives escaped.    But the difficulties of Kekewich, who had been in command since  September 20, were not confined to those created by the military  situation. He was thrown into close association with the man who was one  of the indirect causes of the war, and who had little confidence in  military men, or sympathy with their ideas and methods. Rhodes had come  into his own Kimberley and for the first time he was not master in it.  He found himself a sterilized dictator acting in an atmosphere too  tenuous to support his vitality but sufficient to preserve it from  extinction. He was subject to the authority of the military commandant,  a galling position for a distinguished statesman who had not a high  opinion of the professional capacity of the British officer. From the  age of eighteen he had been his own master except during the intervals  which he had spared from South Africa and spent at Oxford, when he was  temporarily subject to the lax discipline of a University. While his  contemporaries were amusing themselves at college, or performing routine  duties in the Army or the Civil Service, or preparing to enter a  profession, Rhodes was spending the critical years of his life in  outlining the future and scheming for a South African Empire to be  erected on the foundation of the Kimberley Mines.    It was inevitable from the nature of the case and from his intimate  concern in the fortunes of Kimberley that he could not see South African  affairs at large in their true perspective. The sparkle of his diamonds  made him curiously colour-blind and out of this defect in his mental  vision sprang the mischief. Kimberley, for the time being at least,  stood so closely in the foreground that other objects were thrown out of  focus. Nor did the disturbing influence of the glare and halation of  Kimberley only affect the vision of the diamond men within the town. It  closed the eyes of the besiegers without it to a great strategical  opportunity which soon passed away.    The figure of Rhodes in Kimberley was the magnet which attracted and  detained commandos which could have been more usefully employed  elsewhere, and his presence, so far as it had this effect, was of great  service to the perilously weak British force during the first few weeks  of the war. If the commandos squatting before Kimberley had instead been  sent to raid southwards towards the Karroo, and to inflame the Dutch  districts in the Cape Colony, they would have met with little  resistance, and advancing with daily increasing numbers would have had  little difficulty in planting themselves firmly in the heart of the  enemy's country. For the moment the war in the west was waged not  against Great Britain but against the Man of Kimberley.    The diamond men, with Rhodes at their head, forgetting that the object  of the war was the redress of the Outlanders' wrongs in the Transvaal,  began to bellow for relief even before the Boers had completed the  investment of the town. Telegrams couched in extravagant and almost  hysterical language and betraying the egotism and the want of  self-control of the senders were repeatedly despatched. One of these, in  which on October 19 the De Beers directors asked for information as to  the plans of the military authorities at Capetown, \"so as to enable us  to take our own steps in case relief is refused,\" was thought not  unnaturally by Buller to hint at surrender; and although this was not  the intention of the senders it is probable that they did not regret the  interpretation that was put upon it.    Fortunately, however, Kekewich was a cool-headed man who did not suffer  himself to be hustled. While preserving amicable personal relations with  Rhodes, he was careful to let Capetown know that the situation in  Kimberley was by no means desperate and that it would be able to hold  out for several weeks.    The impetuous and childish letters and telegrams sent out by the diamond  men induced Buller, who said afterwards that \"although I had every  confidence in Colonel Kekewich's military capacity I did not trust the  other powers within the city,\" to send Lord Methuen northwards on  November 10 with instructions to help Kimberley by removing unnecessary  non-combatants and natives, and \"to let the people understand that you  have not come to undertake its defence, but to afford it better means of  maintaining its defence.\"    The news of Methuen's approach did not allay the excitement of the  townsmen. His movement was not an essential part of the general plan of  campaign but only a raid in force with the object of putting men and  supplies into Kimberley and enable it to hold on until pressure  elsewhere upon the Boers should raise the siege automatically.    The dignity and the self-respect of the diamond men was affronted. Like  the Syrian captain Naaman, when offered relief of his leprosy by the  prophet Elisha, they resented the simple process by which their own  relief was to be effected. They had looked to an Army Corps at least  marching on Kimberley with all the pomp of war and speedily enabling it  to resume its normal occupation of diamond grubbing; and now they found  that the town was not considered of much account in the scheme of the  military, who regarded it as a mere besieged place of little strategical  importance; which, after some assistance, was to be left dependent for  its safety upon its own exertions while the main army advanced through  the Free State.    On December 4 Kekewich was instructed to make arrangements for the  deportation of a large proportion of the white and coloured population,  Methuen hinting that Rhodes himself might be included. Although Rhodes  had a few weeks before complained of the difficulties caused by the  presence of non-combatants and had even endeavoured to send them away,  he now vehemently opposed their removal. His reasons for so doing are  not very clear, but they appear to be part of the systematic obstruction  which he offered to every proposition of the military authorities which  tended to restrict the output of diamonds. His objections were  transmitted to Buller, who speedily put the question in its proper light  by telegraphing to Kekewich that \"what we have to do is to keep the  Union Jack flying over South Africa without favour to any particular set  of capitalists,\" and Methuen met his protest with the answer that  \"Rhodes has no voice in the matter.\" After the defeat at Magersfontein  the plan of deportation had necessarily to be given up.    In his own proper sphere of a civilian working with civilians Rhodes was  usefully active and his services were great. He employed the persons  thrown out of work by the closing of the mines in labour for the general  benefit of the town, and did much to relieve the distress among the  poorer inhabitants.    The manufacture of a heavy gun, to which the name of Long Cecil was  given, in the De Beers engineering establishment, was soon countered by  the Boers, who brought into action a gun throwing a much heavier shell  which had been disabled by the Naval Battery at Ladysmith, repaired at  Pretoria, and was now mounted before Kimberley. The appearance of Long  Tom, supervening on a reduction on the daily rations, caused a panic  among the civilians. On February 9 Rhodes threatened to call a public  meeting to consider the situation unless he was informed of the plans  for the relief of the town: but Kekewich was authorized by Lord Roberts  not only to forbid the holding of the meeting, but even if necessary to  arrest Rhodes. A private meeting was then held at which a remonstrance  was drawn up for transmission to Lord Roberts through Kekewich; and for  the second time a communication from the Kimberley men was interpreted  as a threat to surrender. It was probably sent with that intent in order  to elicit information as to Lord Roberts' plans.    Kekewich meanwhile was finding his position almost intolerable, and his  representations convinced Lord Roberts of the necessity of raising the  siege of Rhodes without delay and at any cost. It was effected on  February 15 by French's brilliant cavalry movement; but at the cost of  the convoy of 170 wagons which were snapped up by De Wet at Waterval  Drift, and of an Army compelled to march and to fight for nearly four  weeks on reduced rations. But the harvesting of the crop of diamonds was  resumed, and as far as Kimberley was concerned the war was at an end.    Although the siege lasted for more than three months the casualties were  few, only 40 persons being killed and 123 wounded by acts of war. The  privations suffered by the inhabitants, especially during the last few  weeks, were no doubt great, but certainly not greater than the  privations which unhappily are endured by the unemployed in Great  Britain during a hard winter. The siege was conducted without much  vigour and determination, and the most important operation on the side  of the defence was a sortie on November 29 after the news had come in of  Methuen's approach.    The relief of Kimberley closed the public career of the most conspicuous  figure in the British Empire; and with great dignity and self-restraint,  which might well have been imitated by other persons whose conduct  during the war was impugned, Rhodes refrained from publishing a  Kimberley book.

You  mustn't get me used to too many luxuries.  One doesn't miss what one  has never had; but it's awfully hard going without things after one has  commenced thinking they are his--hers (English language needs another  pronoun) by natural right.  Living with Sallie and Julia is an awful  strain on my stoical philosophy.  They have both had things from the  time they were babies; they accept happiness as a matter of course.  The World, they think, owes them everything they want.  Maybe the World  does--in any case, it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up.  But as  for me, it owes me nothing, and distinctly told me so in the beginning.  I have no right to borrow on credit, for there will come a time when  the World will repudiate my claim.    I seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphor--but I hope you grasp my  meaning?  Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the only honest  thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself.                                               MAGNOLIA,                                                 Four days later    I'd got just that much written, when--what do you think happened?  The  maid arrived with Master Jervie's card.  He is going abroad too this  summer; not with Julia and her family, but entirely by himself I told  him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning a  party of girls.  He knows about you, Daddy.  That is, he knows that my  father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to  college; I simply didn't have the courage to tell him about the John  Grier Home and all the rest.  He thinks that you are my guardian and a  perfectly legitimate old family friend.  I have never told him that I  didn't know you--that would seem too queer!    Anyway, he insisted on my going to Europe.  He said that it was a  necessary part of my education and that I mustn't think of refusing.  Also, that he would be in Paris at the same time, and that we would run  away from the chaperon occasionally and have dinner together at nice,  funny, foreign restaurants.    Well, Daddy, it did appeal to me!  I almost weakened; if he hadn't been  so dictatorial, maybe I should have entirely weakened.  I can be  enticed step by step, but I WON'T be forced.  He said I was a silly,  foolish, irrational, quixotic, idiotic, stubborn child (those are a few  of his abusive adjectives; the rest escape me), and that I didn't know  what was good for me; I ought to let older people judge.  We almost  quarrelled--I am not sure but that we entirely did!    In any case, I packed my trunk fast and came up here.  I thought I'd  better see my bridges in flames behind me before I finished writing to  you.  They are entirely reduced to ashes now.  Here I am at Cliff Top  (the name of Mrs. Paterson's cottage) with my trunk unpacked and  Florence (the little one) already struggling with first declension  nouns.  And it bids fair to be a struggle!  She is a most uncommonly  spoiled child; I shall have to teach her first how to study--she has  never in her life concentrated on anything more difficult than  ice-cream soda water.    We use a quiet corner of the cliffs for a schoolroom--Mrs. Paterson  wishes me to keep them out of doors--and I will say that I find it  difficult to concentrate with the blue sea before me and ships  a-sailing by!  And when I think I might be on one, sailing off to  foreign lands--but I WON'T let myself think of anything but Latin  Grammar.      The prepositions a or ab, absque, coram, cum, de e or ex, prae, pro,  sine, tenus, in, subter, sub and super govern the ablative.      So you see, Daddy, I am already plunged into work with my eyes  persistently set against temptation.  Don't be cross with me, please,  and don't think that I do not appreciate your kindness, for I  do--always--always.  The only way I can ever repay you is by turning  out a Very Useful Citizen (Are women citizens?  I don't suppose they  are.) Anyway, a Very Useful Person.  And when you look at me you can  say, 'I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.'    That sounds well, doesn't it, Daddy?  But I don't wish to mislead you.  The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all remarkable; it is  fun to plan a career, but in all probability I shan't turn out a bit  different from any other ordinary person.  I may end by marrying an  undertaker and being an inspiration to him in his work.                               Yours ever,                                             Judy                                                             19th August    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    My window looks out on the loveliest landscape--ocean-scape,  rather--nothing but water and rocks.    The summer goes.  I spend the morning with Latin and English and  algebra and my two stupid girls.  I don't know how Marion is ever going  to get into college, or stay in after she gets there.  And as for  Florence, she is hopeless--but oh! such a little beauty.  I don't  suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid or not so long  as they are pretty?  One can't help thinking, though, how their  conversation will bore their husbands, unless they are fortunate enough  to obtain stupid husbands.  I suppose that's quite possible; the world  seems to be filled with stupid men; I've met a number this summer.    In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide is  right.  I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see my  education is already being put to use!    A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short  concise letter; I'm not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow his  advice.  However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few  days at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I am very nice and  sweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer) be received into favour  again.    Also a letter from Sallie.  She wants me to come to their camp for two  weeks in September.  Must I ask your permission, or haven't I yet  arrived at the place where I can do as I please?  Yes, I am sure I  have--I'm a Senior, you know.  Having worked all summer, I feel like  taking a little healthful recreation; I want to see the Adirondacks; I  want to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie's brother--he's going to teach  me to canoe--and (we come to my chief motive, which is mean) I want  Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find me not there.    I MUST show him that he can't dictate to me.  No one can dictate to me  but you, Daddy--and you can't always!  I'm off for the woods.                                           Judy                                                 CAMP MCBRIDE,                                                     6th September    Dear Daddy,    Your letter didn't come in time (I am pleased to say). If you wish your  instructions to be obeyed, you must have your secretary transmit them  in less than two weeks.  As you observe, I am here, and have been for  five days.    The woods are fine, and so is the camp, and so is the weather, and so  are the McBrides, and so is the whole world.  I'm very happy!    There's Jimmie calling for me to come canoeing.  Goodbye--sorry to have  disobeyed, but why are you so persistent about not wanting me to play a  little?  When I've worked all the summer I deserve two weeks.  You are  awfully dog-in-the-mangerish.    However--I love you still, Daddy, in spite of all your faults.                                               Judy                                                             3rd October  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Back at college and a Senior--also editor of the Monthly.  It doesn't  seem possible, does it, that so sophisticated a person, just four years  ago, was an inmate of the John Grier Home?  We do arrive fast in  America!    What do you think of this?  A note from Master Jervie directed to Lock  Willow and forwarded here.  He's sorry, but he finds that he can't get  up there this autumn; he has accepted an invitation to go yachting with  some friends.  Hopes I've had a nice summer and am enjoying the country.    And he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides, for Julia told  him so!  You men ought to leave intrigue to women; you haven't a light  enough touch.    Julia has a trunkful of the most ravishing new clothes--an evening gown  of rainbow Liberty crepe that would be fitting raiment for the angels  in Paradise.  And I thought that my own clothes this year were  unprecedentedly (is there such a word?) beautiful.  I copied Mrs.  Paterson's wardrobe with the aid of a cheap dressmaker, and though the  gowns didn't turn out quite twins of the originals, I was entirely  happy until Julia unpacked.  But now--I live to see Paris!    Dear Daddy, aren't you glad you're not a girl?  I suppose you think  that the fuss we make over clothes is too absolutely silly?  It is.  No  doubt about it.  But it's entirely your fault.    Did you ever hear about the learned Herr Professor who regarded  unnecessary adornment with contempt and favoured sensible, utilitarian  clothes for women?  His wife, who was an obliging creature, adopted  'dress reform.'  And what do you think he did?  He eloped with a chorus  girl.                               Yours ever,                                                     Judy      PS.  The chamber-maid in our corridor wears blue checked gingham  aprons.  I am going to get her some brown ones instead, and sink the  blue ones in the bottom of the lake.  I have a reminiscent chill every  time I look at them.                                                           17th November    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Such a blight has fallen over my literary career.  I don't know whether  to tell you or not, but I would like some sympathy--silent sympathy,  please; don't re-open the wound by referring to it in your next letter.    I've been writing "]]]
