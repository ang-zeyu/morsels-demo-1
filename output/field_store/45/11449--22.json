An  early knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must have  acquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.  Moreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory that  girls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her of  this childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in which  the boy asks the girl: \"Was it cut off?\" to which the girl replied, \"No,  it's always been so.\"    The sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dream  therefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blames  her mother for not having been born a boy.    That \"being run over\" symbolizes sexual intercourse would not be evident  from this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.      3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.  (Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)    \"He is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely the  Prater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a small  front structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,  however, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is all  for; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They come  into a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants to  pull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if any one  is watching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak to  the watchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty as  much as he wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft,  the walls of which are softly upholstered something like a leather  pocketbook. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, and  then a new shaft begins....\"    Analysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not favorable  from a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis without  offering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but from that  point on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost analyzed  himself. \"The Rotunda,\" he said, \"is my genital, the captive balloon in  front is my penis, about the weakness of which I have worried.\" We must,  however, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is the buttock which  is regularly associated by the child with the genital, the smaller front  structure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks him what this is  all for--that is, he asks him about the purpose and arrangement of the  genitals. It is quite evident that this state of affairs should be  turned around, and that he should be the questioner. As such a  questioning on the side of the father has never taken place in reality,  we must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it conditionally,  as follows: \"If I had only asked my father for sexual enlightenment.\"  The continuation of this thought we shall soon find in another place.    The court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceived  symbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father's  place of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin for  another material in which the father deals, without, however, changing  anything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had entered  his father's business, and had taken a terrible dislike to the  questionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence the  continuation of the above dream thought (\"if I had only asked him\")  would be: \"He would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\" For  the pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, the  dreamer himself gives a second explanation--namely, onanism. This is not  only entirely familiar to us, but agrees very well with the fact that  the secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite (\"Why one can do it  quite openly\"). It, moreover, agrees entirely with our expectations that  the onanistic activity is again put off on the father, just as was the  questioning in the first scene of the dream. The shaft he at once  interprets as the vagina by referring to the soft upholstering of the  walls. That the act of coition in the vagina is described as a going  down instead of in the usual way as a going up, I have also found true  in other instances[2].    The details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longer  platform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. He  had for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given it  up because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up again  with the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistinct  toward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evident  that in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subject  has begun to assert itself; in this his father's business and his  dishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft so  that one might think of a reference to the mother.      4. The male genital symbolized by persons and the female by a landscape.    (Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,  reported by B. Dattner.)    ... Then some one broke into the house and anxiously called for a  policeman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into a  church,[3] to which led a great many stairs;[4] behind the church there  was a mountain,[5] on top of which a dense forest.[6] The policeman was  furnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[7] The two vagrants, who  went along with the policeman quite peaceably, had tied to their loins  sack-like aprons.[8] A road led from the church to the mountain. This  road was overgrown on each side with grass and brushwood, which became  thicker and thicker as it reached the height of the mountain, where it  spread out into quite a forest.      5. A stairway dream.    (Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)    For the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to the  same colleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream.    \"I am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,  whom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At the  bottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)  I grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly find  myself in the middle of the stairway where I practice coitus with the  child (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub my  genital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it very  distinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.  During the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as if  in the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on a  green. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where the  painter's signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthday  present. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect that  cheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself very  indistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of the  stairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from the  pollution.\"    Interpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening of  the day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined some  pictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to the  dream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularly  took his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,  was quite unknown to him.    Later in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemian  servant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \"was made on the  stairs.\" The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusual  occurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to the  home of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexual  relations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. In  witty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,  the dreamer remarked, \"The child really grew on the cellar steps.\"    These experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dream  content, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readily  reproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was also  utilized by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he had  spent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had first  become acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, among  other things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him to  become sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs very  rapidly--so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, he  hardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \"flew\" or \"slid down,\"  as we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, the  beginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexual  excitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamer  used to play pugnacious games with the neighboring children, in which he  satisfied himself just as he did in the dream.    If one recalls from Freud's investigation of sexual symbolism[9] that in  the dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolizes coitus,  the dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect, as is  shown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexual  excitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream this  is represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and the  sadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,  indicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinous  excitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented in  the dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to the  middle of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1549"],[0,"Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians (#18)"],[1,"Syrian, who was a Gentile and did not  belong to the race of Moses. Yet his flesh was cleansed, the God of  Israel was revealed unto him, and he received the Holy Ghost. Naaman  confessed his faith: \"Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the  earth, but in Israel.\" (II Kings 5:15.) Naaman does not do a thing. He  does not busy himself with the Law. He was never circumcised. That does  not mean that his faith was inactive. He said to the Prophet Elisha:  \"Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice  unto other gods, but unto the Lord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy  servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship  there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of  Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon  thy servant in this thing.\" What did the Prophet tell him? \"Go in  peace.\" The Jews do not like to hear the prophet say this. \"What,\" they  exclaim, \"should this heathen be justified without the Law? Should he be  made equal to us who are circumcised?\"    Long before the time of Moses, God justified men without the Law. He  justified many kings of Egypt and Babylonia. He justified Job. Nineveh,  that great city, was justified and received the promise of God that  He would not destroy the city. Why was Nineveh spared? Not because it  fulfilled the Law, but because Nineveh believed the word of God. The  Prophet Jonah writes: \"So the people of Nineveh believed God, and  proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth.\" They repented. Nowhere in the  Book of Jonah do you read that the Ninevites received the Law of Moses,  or that they were circumcised, or that they offered sacrifices.    All this happened long before Christ was born. If the Gentiles were  justified without the Law and quietly received the Holy Spirit at a  time when the Law was in full force, why should the Law count unto  righteousness now, now that Christ has fulfilled the Law?    And yet many devote much time and labor to the Law, to the decrees  of the fathers, and to the traditions of the Pope. Many of these  specialists have incapacitated themselves for any kind of work, good or  bad, by their rigorous attention to rules and laws. All the same, they  could not obtain a quiet conscience and peace in Christ. But the moment  the Gospel of Christ touches them, certainty comes to them, and joy, and  a right judgment.    I have good reason for enlarging upon this point. The heart of man finds  it difficult to believe that so great a treasure as the Holy Ghost is  gotten by the mere hearing of faith. The hearer likes to reason like  this: Forgiveness of sins, deliverance from death, the gift of the Holy  Ghost, everlasting life are grand things. If you want to obtain these  priceless benefits, you must engage in correspondingly great efforts.  And the devil says, \"Amen.\"    We must learn that forgiveness of sins, Christ, and the Holy Ghost,  are freely granted unto us at the preaching of faith, in spite of our  sinfulness. We are not to waste time thinking how unworthy we are of the  blessings of God. We are to know that it pleased God freely to give us  His unspeakable gifts. If He offers His gifts free of charge, why not  take them? Why worry about our lack of worthiness? Why not accept gifts  with joy and thanksgiving?    Right away foolish reason is once more offended. It scolds us. \"When you  say that a person can do nothing to obtain the grace of God, you foster  carnal security. People become shiftless and will do no good at all.  Better not preach this doctrine of faith. Rather urge the people to  exert and to exercise themselves in good works, so that the Holy Ghost  will feel like coming to them.\"    What did Jesus say to Martha when she was very \"careful and troubled  about many things\" and could hardly stand to see her sister Mary sitting  at the feet of Jesus, just listening? \"Martha, Martha,\" Jesus said,  \"thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is  needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken  away from her.\" A person becomes a Christian not by working, but by  hearing. The first step to being a Christian is to hear the Gospel. When  a person has accepted the Gospel, let him first give thanks unto God  with a glad heart, and then let him get busy on the good works to strive  for, works that really please God, and not man-made and self-chosen  works.    Our opponents regard faith as an easy thing, but I know from personal  experience how hard it is to believe. That the Holy Ghost is received by  faith, is quickly said, but not so quickly done.    All believers experience this difficulty. They would gladly embrace the  Word with a full faith, but the flesh deters them. You see, our reason  always thinks it is too easy and cheap to have righteousness, the Holy  Spirit, and life everlasting by the mere hearing of the Gospel.        VERSE 3. Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made    perfect by the flesh?    Paul now begins to warn the Galatians against a twofold danger. The  first danger is: \"Are ye so foolish, that after ye have begun in the  Spirit, ye would now end in the flesh?\"    \"Flesh\" stands for the righteousness of reason which seeks justification  by the accomplishment of the Law. I am told that I began in the spirit  under the papacy, but am ending up in the flesh because I got married.  As though single life were a spiritual life, and married life a carnal  life. They are silly. All the duties of a Christian husband, e.g., to  love his wife, to bring up his children, to govern his family, etc., are  the very fruits of the Spirit.    The righteousness of the Law which Paul also terms the righteousness of  the flesh is so far from justifying a person that those who once had  the Holy Spirit and lost Him, end up in the Law to their complete  destruction.        VERSE 4. Have ye suffered so many things in vain?    The other danger against which the Apostle warns the Galatians is this:  \"Have ye suffered so many things in vain?\" Paul wants to say: \"Consider  not only the good start you had and lost, but consider also the many  things you have suffered for the sake of the Gospel and for the name of  Christ. You have suffered the loss of your possessions, you have borne  reproaches, you have passed through many dangers of body and life. You  endured much for the name of Christ and you endured it faithfully.  But now you have lost everything, the Gospel, faith, and the spiritual  benefit of your sufferings for Christ's sake. What a miserable thing to  endure so many afflictions for nothing.\"        VERSE 4. If it be yet in vain.    The Apostle adds the afterthought: \"If it be yet in vain. I do not  despair of all hope for you. But if you continue to look to the Law  for righteousness, I think you should be told that all your past  true worship of God and all the afflictions that you have endured  for Christ's sake are going to help you not at all. I do not mean to  discourage you altogether. I do hope you will repent and amend.\"        VERSE 5. He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh    miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the    hearing of faith?    This argument based on the experience of the Galatians, pleased the  Apostle so well that he returns to it after he had warned them against  their twofold danger. \"You have not only received the Spirit by the  preaching of the Gospel, but by the same Gospel you were enabled to do  things.\" \"What things?\" we ask. Miracles. At least the Galatians had  manifested the striking fruits of faith which true disciples of the  Gospel manifested in those days. On one occasion the Apostle wrote:  \"The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.\" This \"power\" revealed  itself not only in readiness of speech, but in demonstrations of the  supernatural ability of the Holy Spirit.    When the Gospel is preached unto faith, hope, love, and patience, God  gives His wonder-working Spirit. Paul reminds the Galatians of this.  \"God had not only brought you to faith by my preaching. He had also  sanctified you to bring forth the fruits of faith. And one of the fruits  of your faith was that you loved me so devotedly that you were willing  to pluck out your eyes for me.\" To love a fellow-man so devotedly as to  be ready to bestow upon him money, goods, eyes in order to secure his  salvation, such love is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.    \"These products of the Spirit you enjoyed before the false apostles  misled you,\" the Apostle reminds the Galatians. \"But you haven't  manifested any of these fruits under the regime of the Law. How does  it come that you do not grow the same fruits now? You no longer teach  truly; you do not believe boldly; you do not live well; you do not work  hard; you do not bear things patiently. Who has spoiled you that you no  longer love me; that you are not now ready to pluck out your eyes for  me? What has happened to cool your personal interest in me?\"    The same thing happened to me. When I began to proclaim the Gospel,  there were many, very many who were delighted with our doctrine and had  a good opinion of us. And now? Now they have succeeded in making us so  odious to those who formerly loved us that they now hate us like poison.    Paul argues: \"Your experience ought to teach you that the fruits of love  do not grow on the stump of the Law. You had not virtue prior to the  preaching of the Gospel and you have no virtues now under the regime of  the false apostles.\"    We, too, may say to those who misname themselves \"evangelical\" and flout  their new-found liberty: Have you put down the tyranny of the Pope and  obtained liberty in Christ through the Anabaptists and other fanatics?  Or have you obtained your freedom from us who preach faith in Christ  Jesus? If there is any honesty left in them they will have to confess  that their freedom dates from the"]]]
