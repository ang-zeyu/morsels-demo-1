COLONEL _enters from the garden,  followed by_ CARL.    COLONEL (_on entering, crossly_).    Who ordered William to bring the horse round in front of the bedrooms?  The brute makes a noise with his hoofs that would wake the dead.    CARL.    Are you not going to ride today, Colonel?    COLONEL.    No. Take the horse to the stable!    CARL.    Yes, Colonel. [_Exit_.]    COLONEL (_rings_, CARL _reappears at the door_).    Is Miss Runeck at home?    CARL.    She is in her room; the judge has been with her an hour already.    COLONEL.    What? Early in the morning?    CARL.    Here she is herself.    [_Exit as soon as_ ADELAIDE _enters_.]    _Enter_ ADELAIDE _and_ KORB _through the door on the right_.    ADELAIDE (_to_ KORB).    You had better remain near the garden gate, and when the said young  man comes bring him to us.    [_Exit_ KORB.]    Good-morning, Colonel.    [_Going up to him and examining him gaily_.]    How is the weather today?    COLONEL.    Gray, girl, gray and stormy. Vexation and grief are buzzing round in  my head until it is fit to burst. How is the child?    ADELAIDE.    Better. She was wise enough to fall asleep toward morning. Now she is  sad, but calm.    COLONEL.    This very calmness annoys me. If she would only once shriek and tear  her hair a bit! It would be horrible, but there would be something  natural about it. It is this smiling and then turning away to dry  secret tears that makes me lose my composure. It is unnatural in my  child.    ADELAIDE.    Possibly she knows her father's kind heart better than he does  himself; possibly she still has hopes.    COLONEL.    Of what? Of a reconciliation with him? After what has happened a  reconciliation between Oldendorf and myself is out of the question.    ADELAIDE (_aside_).    I wonder if he wants me to contradict him!    _Enter_ KORB.    KORB (_to_ ADELAIDE).    The gentleman has come.    ADELAIDE.    I will ring.    [_Exit_ KORB.]    Help me out of a little dilemma. I have to speak with a strange young  man who seems in need of help, and I should like to have you stay near  me.--May I leave this door open?    [_Points to the door on the left_.]    COLONEL.    That means, I suppose, in plain English, that I  am to go in there?    ADELAIDE.    I beg it of you--just for five minutes.    COLONEL.    Very well--if only I don't have to listen.    ADELAIDE.    I do not require it; but you will listen all the  same if the conversation happens to interest you.    COLONEL (_smiling_).    In that case I shall come out.    [_Exit to the left_; ADELAIDE _rings_.]    _Enter_ SCHMOCK. KORB _also appears at the entrance, but quickly  withdraws_.    SCHMOCK (_with a bow_).    I wish you a good-morning. Are you the lady who sent me her secretary?    ADELAIDE.    Yes. You said you wished to speak to me personally.    SCHMOCK.    Why should the secretary know about it if I want to tell you  something? Here are the notes that Senden wrote and that I found in  the paper-basket of the _Coriolanus_. Look them over, and see if they  will be of use to the Colonel. What can I do with them? There's  nothing to be done with them.    ADELAIDE (_looking through them, reading, in an aside_).    \"Here I send you the wretched specimens of style, etc.\" Incautious and  very low-minded! [_Lays them on the table. Aloud_.] At any rate these  unimportant notes are better off in my paper-basket than in any one  else's. And what, sir, induces you to confide in me?    [Illustration: _Permission Union Deutsch um Vellagssesellsckaft  Stuttgart_. LUNCH BUFFET AT KISSENGEN     ADOLPH VON MENZEL. ]    SCHMOCK.    I suppose because Bellmaus told me you were a clever person who would  choose a good way of telling the Colonel to be on his guard against  Senden and against my editor; and the Colonel is a kind man; the other  day he ordered a glass of sweet wine and a salmon sandwich as a lunch  for me.    COLONEL (_visible at the door, clasping his hands sympathetically_).    Merciful heavens!    SCHMOCK.    Why should I let him be duped by these people!    ADELAIDE.    Since you did not dislike the lunch, we will see that you get another  one.    SCHMOCK.    Oh please, don't trouble yourself on my account.    ADELAIDE.    Can we help you with anything else?    SCHMOCK.    What should you be able to help me with? [_Examining his boots and  clothes_.] I have everything in order now. My trouble is only that I  have got into the wrong occupation. I must try to get out of  literature.    ADELAIDE (_sympathetically_.)    It is very hard, I suppose, to feel at home in literature?    SCHMOCK.    That depends. My editor is an unfair man. He cuts out too much and  pays too little. \"Attend to your style first of all,\" says he; \"a good  style is the chief thing.\" \"Write impressively, Schmock,\" says he;  \"write profoundly; it is required of a newspaper today that it be  profound.\" Good! I write profoundly, I make my style logical! But when  I bring him what I have done he hurls it away from him and shrieks:  \"What is that? That is heavy, that is pedantic!\" says he. \"You must  write dashingly; it's brilliant you must be, Schmock. It is now the  fashion to make everything pleasant for the reader.\" What am I to do?  I write dashingly again; I put a great deal of brilliant stuff in the  article; and when I bring it he takes his red pencil and strikes out  all that is commonplace and leaves me only the brilliant stuff  remaining.    COLONEL.    Are such things possible?    SCHMOCK.    How can I exist under such treatment? How can I write him only  brilliant stuff at less than a penny a line. I can't exist under it!  And that is why I'm going to try to get out of the business. If only I  could earn twenty-five to thirty dollars, I would never in my life  write again for a newspaper; I would then set up for myself in  business--a little business that could support me.    ADELAIDE.    Wait a moment! [_Looks into her purse_.]    COLONEL (_hastily coming forward_).    Leave that to me, dear Adelaide. The young man wants to cease being a  journalist. That appeals to me. Here, here is money such as you desire  if you will promise me from this day on not to touch a pen again for a  newspaper. Here, take it.    SCHMOCK.    A Prussian bank note--twenty-five thalers in currency? On my honor, I  promise you, on my honor and salvation, I go this very day to a cousin  of mine who has a paying business. Would you like an I.O.U., Colonel,  or shall I make out a long-term promissory note?    COLONEL.    Get out with your promissory note!    SCHMOCK.    Then I will write out a regular I.O.U. I prefer it to be only an  I.O.U.    COLONEL (_impatiently_).    I don't want your I.O.U. either. Sir, for God's sake get out of the  house!    SCHMOCK.    And how about the interest? If I can have it at five per cent. I  should like it.    ADELAIDE.    The gentleman makes you a present of the money.    SCHMOCK.    He makes me a present of the money? It's a miracle! I tell you what,  Colonel, if I don't succeed with the money it remains a gift, but if I  work my way up with it I return it. I hope I will work my way up.  COLONEL. Do just as you like about that.    SCHMOCK.    I like to have it that way, Colonel.--Meanwhile I thank you, and may  some other joy come to make it up to you. Good day, Sir and Madam.    ADELAIDE.    We must not forget the lunch. [_Rings,_ KORB _enters_.] Dear Korb!  [_Talks in a low tone to him_.]    SCHMOCK.    O please, do not go to that trouble!    [_Exeunt_ SCHMOCK _and_ KORB.]    COLONEL.    And now, dear lady, explain this whole conversation; it concerns me  intimately enough.    ADELAIDE.    Senden spoke tactlessly to outsiders about his relations with you and  your household. This young man had overheard some of it, and also had  notes written by Senden in his possession, which contained unsuitable  expressions. I thought it best to get these notes out of his hands.    COLONEL.    I want you to let me have those letters, Adelaide.    ADELAIDE (_entreating_).    Why, Colonel?    COLONEL.    I won't get angry, girl.    ADELAIDE.    Nor is it worth while to do so. But still I beg you won't look at  them. You know enough now, for you know that he, with his associates,  does not merit such great confidence as you have latterly reposed in  him.    COLONEL (_sadly_).    Well, well! In my old days I have had bad luck with my acquaintances.    ADELAIDE.    If you put Oldendorf and this one (_pointing to the letters_) in the  same class you are quite mistaken.    COLONEL.    I don't do that, girl. For Senden I had no such affection, and that's  why it is easier to bear it when he does me an injury.    ADELAIDE (_gently_).    And because you loved the other one, that was the reason why yesterday  you were so--    COLONEL.    Say it, mentor--so harsh and violent!    ADELAIDE.    Worse than that, you were unjust.    COLONEL.    I said the same thing to myself last night, as I went to Ida's room  and heard the poor thing cry. I was a hurt, angry man and was wrong in  the form--but in the matter itself I was, all the same, right. Let him  be member of Parliament; he may be better suited for it than I. It is  his being a newspaper writer that separates us.    ADELAIDE.    But he is only doing what you did yourself!    COLONEL.    Don't remind me of that folly! Were he as my son-in-law to hold a  different opinion from mine regarding current happenings--that I could  doubtless stand. But if day by day he were to proclaim aloud to the  world feelings and sentiments the opposite of mine, and I had to read  them, and had to hear my son-in-law reproached and laughed at for them  on all sides by old friends and comrades, and I had to swallow it  all--you see that is more than I could bear!    ADELAIDE.    And Ida? Because you won't bear it Ida is to be made unhappy?    COLONEL.    My poor child! She has been unhappy throughout the whole affair.

After a  few months' trial, the profits were allowed to accumulate until they  made up L5 per share, on which capital no less than L6,000 were paid in  dividends during the first thirty years. The Supply Associations of the  present day are somewhat differently constituted, such establishments as  the one in Corporation Street (formerly in Cannon Street) and that in  High Street being on the most extensive scale, offering to the general  public all the advantages derivable from the use of large capital,  combined with a fair division of profits to the customer, as well as to  the shareholders. The Birmingham Household Supply Association in  Corporation Street supplies all the necessaries required in the  household, in addition to eatables and drinkables of the very best  quality, including Messrs. Walter Showell and Sons' ales, which are sent  out at the same prices as from the firm's own offices, either in cask or  bottle.    ~Cornavii.~--The ancient inhabitants of this part of England, but who  were subdued by the Romans. Whether the said inhabitants had any name  for the particular spot now called Birmingham must for ever remain  doubtful.    ~Corn Exchange,~ in High-street, was opened October 28, 1847. The  original capital of the Company was L5,000, in shares of L25 each; but  the total cost of erection was a little over L6,000. The length of the  interior is 172 feet and the breadth 40 feet.    ~Corn Laws.~--Long before the formation of the Anti-Corn Law League in  1838, a movement for the repeal of the obnoxious imposts had been  started in this town, a petition being sent from here to Parliament in  March, 1815, with 48,600 signatures attached. The doings of the League  and their ultimate success is an off-told tale, the men of Birmingham of  course taking their part in the struggle, which culminated on the 26th  of June, 1846, in the passing of Sir Robert Peel's Bill for the total  repeal of all duties levied on corn and breadstuffs.    ~Coroners.~--The first borough coroner, the late Dr. Birt Davies, was  appointed May 15, 1839, and he held the office till July, 1875, when Mr.  Henry Hawkes was chosen as his successor, only one member of the Town  Council voting against him. The preent coroner has introduced several  improvements on the old system, especially in the matters of holding  inquests at public-houses, and the summoning of jurors. Formerly the  latter were chosen from the residents nearest to the scene of death,  some gentlemen being continually called upon, while the occasional  exhibition of a dead body in the back lumberroom of an inn yard, among  broken bottles and gaping stablemen, was not conductive to the dignity  of a coroner's court or particularly agreeable to the unfortunate  surgeon who might have to perform a _post mortem_. Thanks to the  persevering tenacity of Mr. Hawkes we have a proper court in  Moor-street, and a mortuary at every police station to which bodies can  at once be taken. The jurors are now chosen by rotation, so that having  been once called upon to act as a good citizen in such a capacity no  gentleman need fear a fresh summons for some years to come. Mr. Hooper,  the coroner for South Staffordshire, received his appointment in 1860.    ~Corporation.~--The Charter of Incorporation of the Borough of  Birmingham, authorising the formation of a Governing body, consisting of  Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors, duly elected by the Burgesses, dates  from October 31, 1838. The elections took place in December, the first  meeting being held on the 27. The borough was originally divided into 13  wards, but has since been, by Order in Council, made into 16, though the  number of Aldermen (16) and Councillors (48) has not been increased. The  Mayor is elected for one year, the Councillors for three, and the  Aldermen for six. The first Mayor chosen was William Schofield, Esq.,  who was succeeded by P.H. Muntz, Esq., in 1839 and 1840, the election  taking place at the November sitting in each year. Since 1840, the  Mayoral chair has been successively filled by:--    1841, S. Beale; 1842, J. James; 1843, T. Weston; 1844, T. Phillips;  1845, H. Smith; 1846, R. Martineau; 1847, C. Geach; 1848, S. Thornton;  1849, W. Lucy; 1850, W. Lucy; 1851, H. Smith; 1852, H. Hawkes; 1853, J.  Baldwin; 1854, J. Palmer; 1855, T. R, T. Hodgson; 1856, J. Ratcliff;  1857, J. Ratcliff; 1858, Sir J. Ratcliff, Kt.; 1859, T. Lloyd; 1860, A.  Ryland; 1861, H. Manton; 1862, C. Sturge; 1863, W. Holliday; 1864, H.  Wiggin; 1865, E. Yates; 1866, G. Dixon; 1867, T. Avery; 1868, H.  Holland; 1869, T. Prime; 1870, G. B. Lloyd; 1871, J. Sadler; 1872, A.  Biggs; 1873, J. Chamberlain; 1874, J. Chamberlain; 1875, J. Chamberlain;  1876, G. Baker; 1877, W. Kenrick; 1878, J. Collings; 1879, R.  Chamberlain; 1880, R. Chamberlain; 1881, T. Avery; 1882, W. White; 1883,  W. Cook; 1884, W. Martineau.    The members of the Council in 1862 subscribed L200 for the purchase of a  \"Mayor's Chain,\" the first to wear \"the glittering gaud,\" strange to  say, being a Quaker, Charles Sturge to wit. To this chain a valuable  addition has since been made in the shape of a stone, worth L150,  presented to the Town Council by Mr. W. Spencer, June 27, 1873, as being  the first diamond cut in Birmingham, and which was appropriately  mounted. For the names and addresses of the Aldermen and Councillors of  the various wards (changes taking place yearly) reference should be made  to \"The Birmingham Red Book\" published annually, in which will also be  found a list of all the borough officials, &c.    ~Corporation Stock.~--The balance against the Borough in the shape of  loans, or mortgages on the then rates, when the Town Council took over  from the Street Commissioners was L121,100. By the end of 1864 the  Borough debts stood at L638,300, at varying rates of interest. After the  purchase of the Gas and Water Works, and the commencement of the  Improvement Scheme, this amount was vastly increased, the town's  indebtedness standing in 1880 at no less than L6,226,145. The old system  of obtaining loans at the market price of the day, and the requirement  of the Local Government Board that every separate loan should be repaid  in a certain limited number of years, when so large an amount as 6-1/4  millions came to be handled necessitated a consolidation scheme, which  has since been carried out, to the relief of present ratepayers and a  saving to those who will follow. The whole of the liabilities in the  Borough on loans were converted into Corporation three and a half per  cent. stock at the commencement of 1881, the operation being performed  by the Bank of England. The tenders for same were opened Jan. 18th, when  it was found that L1,200,000 had been applied for at and slightly over  the minimum rate of L98 per L100. The remaining L800,000 was allotted to  a syndicate, who afterwards applied for it at the minimum price. Persons  having money to invest cannot do better than visit the Borough  Treasurer, Mr. Hughes, who will give every information as to the mode of  investing even a L10 note in the Birmingham Corporation Stock.    ~Council House.~--See \"_Public Buildings_.\"    ~County Areas.~--The total areas of this and adjoining counties are:--  Warwickshire 566,458 acres, Worcestershire 472,453, Staffordshire  732,434, and Shropshire 841,167.    ~County Court.~--First opened in Birmingham at the Waterloo Rooms,  Waterloo Street, April 28th, 1847. R. G. Welford, Esq., Q.C., acting as  judge until September, 1872. He was followed by H. W. Cole, Esq., Q.C.,  who died in June, 1876; James Motteram, Esq., Q.C., who died Sept. 19,  1884: the present judge being W. Chambers, Esq., Q.C. The Circuit (No.  21) includes the towns and places of Aston, Atherstone, Balsall Heath,  Curdworth, Castle Bromwich, Erdington, Gravelly Hill, Handsworth,  Harborne, King's Heath, King's Norton, Lea Marston, Little Bromwich,  Maxstoke, Minworth, Moseley, Nether Whitacre, Perry Barr, Saltley, Selly  Oak, Sutton Coldfield, Tamworth, Water Orton and Wishaw.    ~County Officials.~--For names and addresses of the Lord Lieutenant,  Deputy Lieutenant, High Sheriff, County Magistrates, and other official  gentlemen connected with the county of Warwick, see \"Red Book.\"    ~Court of Bankruptcy~ holden at Birmingham (at the County Court, in  Corporation Street) comprises all the places within the district of the  County Court of Warwickshire holden at Birmingham, Tamworth and  Solihull, and all the places in the district of the County Court of  Worcestershire holden at Redditch.    ~Court Of Judicature.~--Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall, and  Worcester, are District Registries of the Supreme Court of Judicature.    ~Court Leet.~--The origin of that peculiar kind of Local Government  Board, known in the olden days as the Court Leet of the Manor of  Birmingham, is lost in the misty shadows of our past history. Doubtless  there were many onerous duties connected therewith, and very possibly  the officials considered themselves as \"men of high degree,\" but what  those duties actually were, and what the remuneration for their due  fulfilment, appears to have been matter of doubt, even so late as a  hundred and a few odd years ago. The rights, powers, and privileges of  the officers of this Court had evidently been questioned by some of our  Radical-minded great-grandfathers, as we find it was deemed necessary to  assemble a jury on the 20th day of October, 1779, to \"ascertain and  present\" the same, and from a little pamphlet at that time published, we  extract the following:--    _The Office of Low Bailiff_.--\"The Jury find and present that this  officer is annually elected by the Jury, and that his office is in the  nature of Sheriff of the Manor; that to him all the process of the Court  is to be directed, and that it is his right and duty to summon all  Juries to this court. And the Low Bailiff, at each fair, is entitled to"]]]
