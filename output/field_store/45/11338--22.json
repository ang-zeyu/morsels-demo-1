One universal shape is adopted in the form of the ungeeah[21] (bodice),  which is, however, much varied in the material and ornamental part; some  are of gauze or net, muslin, &c., the more transparent in texture the more  agreeable to taste, and all are more or less ornamented with spangles and  silver trimmings. It is made to fit the bust with great exactness, and to  fasten behind with strong cotton cords; the sleeves are very short and  tight, and finished with some fanciful embroidery or silver riband. Even  the women servants pride themselves on pretty ungeeahs, and all will  strive to have a little finery about them, however coarse the material it  is formed of may happen to be. They are never removed at night but  continue to be worn a week together, unless its beauty fades earlier, or  the ornamental parts tarnish through extreme heat.    With the ungeeah is worn a transparent courtie (literally translated shirt)  of thread net; this covers the waistband of the pyjaamah but does not  screen it; the seams and hems are trimmed with silver or gold ribands.    The deputtah is a useful envelope, and the most graceful part of the whole  female costume. In shape and size, a large sheet will convey an idea of  the deputtah's dimensions; the quality depends on choice or circumstances;  the preference is given to our light English manufacture of leno or muslin  for every-day wear by gentlewomen; but on gala days, gold and silver gauze  tissues are in great request, as is also fine India muslin manufactured at  Decca--transparent and soft as the web of the gossamer spider;--this is  called shubnum[22] (night dew), from its delicate texture, and is procured  at a great expense, even in India; some deputtahs are formed of  gold-worked muslin, English crape, coloured gauze, &c. On ordinary  occasions ladies wear them simply bound with silver riband, but for dress  they are richly trimmed with embroidery and bullion fringes, which add  much to the splendour of the scene, when two or three hundred females are  collected together in their assemblies. The deputtah is worn with much  original taste on the back of the head, and falls in graceful folds over  the person; when standing, it is crossed in front, one end partially  screening the figure, the other thrown over the opposite shoulder.    I should say they rarely stand; but when distinguished guests, or their  elders amongst relatives, are announced, this mark of respect is never  omitted. It is an interesting sight, as they have much ease and grace in  their manner, which no tutoring could impart; they rise and arrange their  drapery, advance a few steps from their place in the hall, and embrace  their visitor thrice in due form, ending by salaaming, with the head bowed  very low towards the ground and the open hand raised to the forehead,  three times in succession, with solemnity and dignity.    I have told you, in a former Letter, how many precious ornaments were laid  aside on the eve of Mahurrum, and need hardly describe them again. Their  fondness for good jewellery perhaps exceeds the same propensity in any  other females on the globe: the rude workmanship of Native jewellers is  never an object of weighty consideration, provided the precious metals are  unalloyed in quality. The same may be remarked in their selection of  jewels: pearls of the largest size, even when discoloured or misshapen,  are selected in preference to the most regular in form and colour, of a  smaller size; large diamonds, having flaws, are often preferred to smaller  ones most perfect. The gentlemen are good judges of precious stones, and  evince some taste in their style of ornaments; they are worn on their  turbans, and in necklaces or harrhs[23]--rings, armlets, &c.; but these  are all laid aside at seasons of devotion, when they are restricted  wearing, not only ornaments, but mixed articles of silk and wool in their  apparel. The most religious men and women invariably abstain from  ornamental dress in every way, deeming it frivolous vanity, and  inconsistent with that they profess--'to be seeking God, and forsaking  worldly things'.    The ladies never wear stockings,[24] and only cover the feet with shoes  when pacing across their court-yard, which bounds their view and their  walks. Nevertheless, there is a fashion and taste about the ladies' shoes,  which is productive of much emulation in zeenahnah life;--they are  splendidly worked in many patterns, with gold and silver spangles,  variously-coloured small seed beads and embroidery--the whole one mass of  glittering metal;--they are made with sharp points curling upwards, some  nearly reaching half-way to the knees, and always worn down at the heel,  as dressing slippers; the least costly for their every-day wear are of  gold embroidery on velvet; the less opulent condescend to wear tinsel work,  and the meanest servants yellow or red cloth with silver binding. The same  style of shoes are worn by the males as by the females; I have seen some  young men with green shagreen slippers for the rainy season; these are  made with a high heel and look unseemly. The fashion of shoes varies with  the times in this country, as well as in others--sometimes it is genteel  to have small points to the shoes; at another, the points are long and  much curled; but they still retain the preference for pointed shoes  whatever be the fashion adopted.    The greatest novelty in the way of shoes, which came under my observation  in India, was a pair of silver embroidery, small pointed, and very neatly  made: on the points and round the instep small silver bells were fastened,  which produced harmony with every step, varied by the quick or more gentle  paces of the wearer; these were a present to me from a lady of distinction  in Oude. Upon visiting this lady on one occasion, my black silk slippers,  which I had left at the entrance (as is the custom here), had most likely  attracted the curiosity of the Begum's slaves, for when that lady attended  me to the threshold, they could nowhere be found; and I was in danger of  being obliged to soil my stockings by walking shoeless to my palkie,  across the court-yard. In this dilemma the lady proffered me the pair here  described; I was much amused with the novelty of the exchange, upon  stepping into the musical shoes, which, however they may be prized by  Native ladies, did not exactly suit my style of dress, nor convenience in  walking, although I must always remember the Begum's attention with  gratitude.      The ladies' society is by no means insipid or without interest; they are  naturally gifted with good sense and politeness, fond of conversation,  shrewd in their remarks, and their language is both correct and refined.  This, at first, was an enigma to me, considering that their lives are  spent in seclusion, and that their education was not conducted on European  principles; the mystery, however, has passed away upon an intimate  acquaintance with the domestic habits of the people. The men with whom  genteel women converse, are generally well educated, and from the  naturally inquisitive disposition of the females, not a word escapes the  lips of a father, husband, or brother, without an inquiry as to its  meaning, which having once ascertained, is never forgotten, because their  attention is not diverted by a variety of pursuits, or vain amusements.  The women look up to the opinions of their male relatives with the same  respect as children of other climes are accustomed to regard their tutor  or governess,--considering every word pronounced as worthy of imitation,  and every sentiment expressed, as a guide to their own. Thus the habit of  speaking correctly is so familiar to the females of Mussulmaun society,  that even women servants, long accustomed to serve in zeenahnahs, may be  readily distinguished by their language from the same class of people in  attendance on European ladies.    P.S. All good Mussulmauns are expected to wear their beards, by command of  the Prophet; so says my informant, who is of 'the faith', and wears his  beard, in accordance with the injunction of his Lawgiver. In modern times,  however, the Mussulmauns have seen fit to modify the strict letter of the  law, and we perceive generally, mustachios only reserved on the upper lip.  This ornament is trained with the nicest care amongst the fashionable  young men of the present day, and made to creep over the lip at each  corner of the mouth with curling points; well-trained mustachios being  with them much esteemed.    The religious Mussulmauns become more scrupulous as they advance in  knowledge of their faith, when they allow their beards to grow and their  heads to be shaven; if the hair turns white--while to look well is an  object of interest--a dye is resorted to, composed of mayndhie and indigo,  which restores its youthful appearance, and the beard retains its black  glossy hue for about six weeks, when the process of dyeing is again made  the business of a convenient hour.[25] The vanities of the world ceasing  to charm (the heart being fixed on more important subjects), the beard is  permitted to retain its natural colour; and, truly, the venerable  countenance of an aged Mussulmaun, with a silvery-white beard flowing  nearly to his girdle, is a picture that would interest every beholder well  acquainted with Bible history.    When the Mussulmaun determines on fulfilling the command of his Lawgiver,  in making the pilgrimage to Mecca, the beard is allowed to grow whatever  be his age; and this may be considered a badge of their faith, none being  admitted at 'the Holy House' who have not this passport on their chin.

Third Part. C. M.  Christ's obedience and death; or,  God glorified and sinners saved.    1 Father, I sing thy wondrous grace,  I bless my Saviour's Name,  He bought salvation for the poor,  And bore the sinner's shame.    2 His deep distress has rais'd us high,  His duty and his zeal  Fulfill'd the law which mortals broke,  And finish'd all thy will.    3 His dying groans, his living songs  Shall better please my God  Than harp or trumpet's solemn sound,  Than goats' or bullocks' blood.    4 This shall his humble followers see,  And set their hearts at rest;  They by his death draw near to thee,  And live for ever blest.    5 Let heaven, and all that dwell on high,  To God their voices raise,  While lands and seas assist the sky,  And join t' advance the praise.    6 Zion is thine, most holy God;  Thy Son shall bless her gates;  And glory purchas'd by his blood  For thine own Israel waits.      Psalm 69:4. First Part. L. M.  Christ's passion, and sinners' salvation.    1 Deep in our hearts let us record  The deeper sorrows of our Lord;  Behold the rising billows roll  To overwhelm his holy soul.    2 In long complaints he spends his breath,  While hosts of hell, and powers of death,  And all the sons of malice join  To execute their curst design.    3 Yet, gracious God, thy power and love  Has made the curse a blessing prove;  Those dreadful sufferings of thy Son  Aton'd for sins which we had done.    4 The pangs of our expiring Lord  The honours of thy law restor'd;  His sorrows made thy justice known,  And paid for follies not his own.    6 O for his sake our guilt forgive,  And let the mourning sinner live;  The Lord will hear us in his Name,  Nor shall our hope be turn'd to shame.      Psalm 69:5. 7 &c. Second Part. L. M.  Christ's sufferings and zeal.    1 'Twas for thy sake, eternal God,  Thy son sustain'd that heavy load  Of base reproach and sore disgrace,  And shame defil'd his sacred face.    2 The Jews, his brethren and his kin,  Abus'd the man that check'd their sin:  While he fulfill'd thy holy laws,  They hate him, but without a cause.    3 [\"My Father's house, said he, was made  \"A place for worship, not for trade;\"  Then scattering all their gold and brass,  He scourg'd the merchants from the place.]    4 [Zeal for the temple of his God  Consum'd his life, expos'd his blood:  Reproaches at thy glory thrown  He felt, and mourn'd them as his own.]    5 [His friends forsook, his followers fled,  While foes and arms surround his head;  They curse him with a slanderous tongue,  And the false judge maintains the wrong.]    6 His life they load with hateful lies,  And charge his lips with blasphemies;  They nail him to the shameful tree:  There hung the man that dy'd for me.    7 [Wretches with hearts as hard as stones,  Insult his piety and groans;  Gall was the food they gave him there,  And mock'd his thirst with vinegar.]    8 But God beheld; and from his throne  Marks out the men that hate his Son;  The hand that rais'd him from the dead  Shall pour the vengeance on their head.      Psalm 71:1. 5-9. First Part.  The aged saint's reflection and hope.    1 My God, my everlasting hope,  I live upon thy truth;  Thine hands have held my childhood up,  And strengthen'd all my youth.    2 My flesh was fashion'd by thy power,  With all these limbs of mine;  And from my mother's painful hour  I've been entirely thine.    3 Still has my life new wonders seen  Repeated every year;  Behold my days that yet remain,  I trust them to thy care.    4 Cast me not off when strength declines,  When hoary hairs arise;  And round me let thy glories shine  Whene'er thy servant dies.    5 Then in the history of my age,  When men review my days,  They'll read thy love in every page,  In every line thy praise.      Psalm 71:2. 15 14 16 23 22 24. 2d Part.  Christ our strength and righteousness.    1 My Saviour, my almighty Friend,  When I begin thy praise,  Where will the growing numbers end,  The numbers of thy grace?    2 Thou art my everlasting trust,  Thy goodness I adore;  And since I knew thy graces first  I speak thy glories more.    3 My feet shall travel all the length  Of the celestial road,  And march with courage in thy strength  To see my Father God.    4 When I am fill'd with sore distress  For some surprising sin,  I'll plead thy perfect righteousness,  And mention none but thine.    5 How will my lips rejoice to tell  The victories of my King!  My soul redeem'd from sin and hell  Shall thy salvation sing.    6 [My tongue shall all the day proclaim  My Saviour and my God;  His death has brought my foes to shame,  And drown'd them in his blood.    7 Awake, awake my tuneful powers;  With this delightful song  I'll entertain the darkest hours,  Nor think the season long.]      Psalm 71:3. 17-21. Third Part.  The aged Christian's prayer and song; or,  Old age, death, and the resurrection.    1 God of my childhood and my youth,  The guide of all my days,  I have declar'd thy heavenly truth,  And told thy wondrous ways.    2 Wilt thou forsake my hoary hairs,  And leave my fainting heart?  Who shall sustain my sinking years  If God my strength depart?    3 Let me thy power and truth proclaim  To the surviving age,  And leave a savour of thy Name  When I shall quit the stage.    4 The land of silence and of death  Attends my next remove;  O may these poor remains of breath  Teach the wide world thy love.    PAUSE.    5 Thy righteousness is deep and high,  Unsearchable thy deeds;  Thy glory spreads beyond the sky,  And all my praise exceeds.    6 Oft have I heard thy threatenings roar,  And oft endur'd the grief;  But when thy hand has press'd me sore,  Thy grace was my relief.    7 By long experience have I known  Thy sovereign power to save;  At thy command I venture down  Securely to the grave.    8 When I lie buried deep in dust,  My flesh shall be thy care  These withering limbs with thee I trust  To raise them strong and fair.      Psalm 72:1. First Part.  The kingdom of Christ.    1 Great God, whose universal sway  The known and unknown worlds obey,  Now give the kingdom to thy Son,  Extend his power, exalt his throne.    2 Thy sceptre well becomes his hands,  All heaven submits to his commands;  His justice shall avenge the poor,  And pride and rage prevail no more.    3 With power he vindicates the just,  And treads th' oppressor in the dust;  His worship and his fear shall last  Till hours and years and time be past.    4 As rain on meadows newly mown  So shall he send his influence down;  His grace on fainting souls distils  Like heavenly dew on thirsty hills.    5 The heathen lands that lie beneath  The shades of overspreading death,  Revive at his first dawning light,  And deserts blossom at the sight.    6 The saints shall flourish in his days,  Drest in the robes of joy and praise;  Peace like a river from his throne  Shall flow to nations yet unknown.      Psalm 72:2. Second Part.  Christ's kingdom among the Gentiles.    1 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun  Does his successive journies run;  His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,  Till moons shall wax and wane no more.    2 [Behold the islands with their kings,  And Europe her best tribute brings;  From north to south the princes meet  To pay their homage at his feet.    3 There Persia glorious to behold,  There India shines in eastern gold:  And barbarous nations at his word  Submit, and bow, and own their Lord.]    4 For him shall endless prayer be made  And princes throng to crown his head;  His Name like sweet perfume shall rise  With every morning sacrifice.    5 People and realms of every tongue  Dwell on his love with sweetest song:  And infant voices shall proclaim  Their early blessings on his Name.    6 Blessings abound where'er he reigns,  The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,  The weary find eternal rest,  And all the sons of want are blest.    7 [Where he displays his healing power,  Death and the curse are known no more;  In him the tribes of Adam boast  More blessings than their father lost.    8 Let every creature rise, and bring  Peculiar honours to our King;  Angels descend with songs again,  And earth repeat the long Amen.]      Psalm 73:1. First Part. C. M.  Afflicted saints happy, and  prosperous sinners cursed.    1 Now I'm convinc'd the Lord is kind  To men of heart sincere,  Yet once my foolish thoughts repin'd  And border'd on despair.    2 I griev'd to see the wicked thrive,  And spoke with angry breath,  \"How pleasant and profane they live!  \"How peaceful is their death!    3 \"With well-fed flesh and haughty eyes  \"They lay their fears to sleep;  \"Against the heavens their slanders rise,  \"While saints in silence weep.    4 \"In vain I lift my hands to pray,  \"And cleanse my heart in vain,  \"For I am chasten'd all the day,  \"The night renews my pain.'    5 Yet while my tongue indulg'd complaints,  I felt my heart reprove; "]]]
