[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13635"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War, Vol 1, No. 1 (#18)"],[1," of the Smaller States.*    Already the war has greatly added to the value of one of the factors  upon which the League of Peace will depend. The smaller States: Holland,  Belgium, Switzerland, and the Scandinavian Powers, would have joined it  any time these 40 years, had it existed, for the sake of its protection,  and thereby made the Protestant north of Mr. Houston Chamberlain's dream  as much a reality as any such dream is ever likely to be. But after the  fight put up by Belgium the other day, the small States will be able to  come in with the certainty of being treated with considerable respect as  military factors; for Belgium can now claim to have saved Europe  single-handed. Germany has been very unpleasantly reminded of the fact  that though a big man may be able to beat a little one, yet if the  little one fights for all he is worth he may leave the victor very sorry  he broke the peace. Even as between the big Powers, victory has not, as  far as the fighting has yet gone, been always with the biggest  battalions. With a couple of millions less men, the Kaiser might have  taken more care of them and made a better job of it.    At the same time I hold no brief for small States as such, and most  vehemently deny that we are in any way bound to knight errantry on their  behalf as against big ones. They are mostly either incorrigibly  bellicose themselves, like Montenegro, or standing temptations to the  big Powers, like Bosnia and Herzegovina. They multiply frontiers, which  are nuisances, and languages, which have made confusion since the  building of Babel. The striking contrast between the United States of  North America and the disunited States of South America in this respect  is, from the Pacifist point of view, very much in favor of the northern  unity. The only objection to large political units is that they make  extremely dangerous autocracies. But as groups of federated democracies  they are the best neighbours in the world. A federal democratic Russia  would be as safe a colleague as America: a federal democratic Germany  would be as pleasant company as Switzerland. Let us, I beg, hear no more  of little States as British Dulcineas.      *The Claims of Belgium.*    As to the special case of Belgium, its claims in the settlement are  simple and indeed single. If we conclude a peace without clearing the  Germans completely out of Belgium, we shall be either beaten or  dishonoured. And such indemnity as a money payment can effect for  Belgium is due not only by Germany, but by Britain, France, and Russia  as well. Belgium has been crushed between the Alliance and the Entente:  it was these two menaces to the peace of Europe that produced  Armageddon; and as Belgium's heroic resistance served the Entente  against the Alliance, the obligation to make good the remediable damage  is even more binding on the Entente.    But there is another and more pressing matter arising out of the  conquest of Belgium.      *The Belgian Refugees and the Problem of Unemployment.*    As I write these lines the descent on our shores of an army of refugees  from captured Antwerp and threatened Ostend has forced the President of  the Local Government Board to make a desperate appeal to all and sundry  to form representative committees to deal with the prevention and relief  of distress: in other words to save the refugees from starving to death.  Now the Board of Trade has already drawn attention to a memorandum of  the Local Government Board as to the propriety of providing employment  for refugees. And instantly and inevitably the condition had to be laid  down that if the Committees find employment for anyone, they shall refer  the case to the local Labour Exchange in order that \"any steps taken to  assist refugees to find employment shall not be such as to endanger the  employment of British workpeople.\" In other words, the starving Belgians  have fled from the Germans only to compete for crust with starving  Englishmen. As long as there is an unemployed Englishman in the  country--and there are a good many, especially in the cotton  industry--how is it possible to give a job to a Belgian without  depriving an Englishman of it? Why, instead of making impossible  conditions, and helplessly asking private citizens to do something for  pity's sake, will not the Government face the fact that the refugee  question is simply an intensification of the normal unemployed question,  the only difference being that we are accustomed to leave our own people  to starve when they are common persons with whom the governing classes  do not associate, whereas the Belgians have rendered us such a  tremendous service in the war, and our statesmen have so loudly  protested that the integrity of Belgium is dearer to England than her  own heart's blood, that we cannot with any decency treat the destitute  Belgians as if they were mere British riffraff. Yet when we attempt to  provide for the Belgians by finding work for them the Board of Trade has  to point out that by doing so we are taking the bread out of the mouths  of our own people. Hence we arrive at the remarkable situation of  starving Britons and Belgians looking hungrily through barbed wire  fences at flourishing communities of jolly and well fed German prisoners  of war (whose friendly hat wavings to me and my fellow passengers as I  rush through Newbury Racecourse Station in the Great Western Express I  hereby acknowledge publicly with all possible good feeling). I therefore  for the present strongly recommend all Belgians who have made up their  minds to flee to England, to pick up German uniforms on the battle  fields and surrender to the British in the character of Uhlans. Their  subsistence will then be secure until the war is over, as we dare not  illtreat our prisoners lest the Germans should retaliate upon the  British soldiers in their hands, even if we were all spiteful enough to  desire to do it, as some of our baser sort have not been ashamed to  propose.    But the women and children, and the too young and the too old, cannot  resort to this expedient. And though theoretically our own unemployed  could be dressed in British uniforms and sent abroad with instructions  to take refuge in neutral territory and be \"interned\" or to surrender to  the first Uhlan patrol they met, yet it would be difficult to reduce  this theory to practice, though the possibility is worth mentioning as a  reduction to absurdity of the situation. As a matter of common sense \"we  should at once place all destitute Belgian refugees on the footing of  prisoners of war, except that we need not post sentries to shoot them if  they try to escape, nor surround them with barbed wire. Indeed these  precautions are necessary in the case of the Germans rather to save  their sense of honour whilst remaining here than to defeat any very  strong longing on their part to return to the trenches.    In a reasonable state of society there would be another difference. The  Belgians would offer to work so as not to be a burden to us; whilst the  German prisoner would say--as he actually does, by the way--\"No: I am  not here by my own will: if you open the door I shall go home and take  myself off your hands; so I am in no way bound to work for you.\" As it  is, our Trade Unions are up in arms at the slightest hint of either  Belgian or German labour being employed when there is no shortage of  English labour!\"      *The Minority Report*.    All this exasperating anomaly and deadlock and breakdown would disappear  if we had a proper system of provision for our own unemployed civilians  (there are no unemployed soldiers: we do not discharge them between the  battles). The Belgians would have found an organization of unemployment  ready for them, and would have been provided for with our own  unemployed, not as refugees, but simply as unemployed. How to do that  need not be explained here. The problem was worked out by one of the  hardest bits of thinking yet done in the Socialist movement, and set  forth in the Minority Report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws  and the Relief of Distress, 1909. Our helplessness in the present  emergency shews how very unwise we were to shelve that report.  Unluckily, what with the wounded vanity of the majority of the  Commission, who had been played off the stage by Mrs. Sidney Webb; the  folly of the younger journalists of the advanced guard, who had just  then rediscovered Herbert Spencer's mare's nest of \"the servile State,\"  and revolted with all the petulant anarchism of the literary profession  against the ideal Interfering Female as typified in their heated  imaginations by poor Mrs. Sidney Webb, who became the Aunt Sally of our  young artists in stale anti-bureaucratic invective; and, above all, the  mulishly silent refusal of our governing classes to see why the  unemployed should not be simply left to starve, as they had always been  (the Poor Law being worse than useless for so large a purpose), nothing  was done; and there is consequently no machinery ready for dealing with  the refugees. That is why we must treat them for the moment simply as  unguarded prisoners of war.      *The General Strike Against War.*    But if the problem of unemployment among our own people becomes acute,  we shall have to fall back on the Minority Report proposals or else run  the risk of a revolt against the war. We have already counted on the  chances of that revolt hampering Germany, just as Germany counted on the  chances of its hampering Russia, The notion that the working classes can  stop a war by a general international strike is never mentioned during  the first rally to the national flag at the outbreak of a war; but it is  there all the time, ready to break out again if the supplies of food and  glory run short. Its gravity lies in its impracticability. If it were  practicable, every sane man would advocate it.

His secretary left the room. The  railroad magnate at once became confidential.    \"Nothing happened on the way?\" he asked, pointedly. \"There was a  freight wreck, I understand?\"    \"And we chanced to be right at hand when that happened,\" said Tom.    \"So was your friend, Mr. Lewis,\" remarked Ned Newton.    \"You don't mean to say that Montagne Lewis--\"    \"Was there. And Andy O'Malley,\" put in Tom.    Then he detailed the incident, as far as he and Ned knew the details,  to Mr. Bartholomew, who listened with close attention.    \"Well, it might merely have been a coincidence,\" murmured the railroad  president. \"But, of course, we can't be sure. Anyhow, it is just as  well if your servant, Mr. Swift, keeps close watch still upon that  locomotive.\"    \"He will,\" said Tom, nodding. \"He is down there in the yard with the  Hercules Three-Oughts-One, and I mean to keep Koku right on the job.\"    \"Good! Let's go down and look at her,\" Mr. Bartholomew said, eagerly.    But first Tom wanted to go into the theoretical particulars of his  invention. And he confessed that thus far his tests of the locomotive  had not been altogether satisfactory.    \"I have got to have a clear track on a stretch of your own line here,  Mr. Bartholomew, and under certain conditions, before I can be sure as  to just how much speed I can get out of the machine.\"    \"Speed is the essential point, Mr. Swift,\" said the railroad man,  seriously.    \"That is what I have been telling Ned,\" Tom rejoined. \"I believe my  improvements over the Jandel patents are worthy. I know I have a very  powerful locomotive. But that is not enough.\"    \"We have got to shoot our trains through the Pas Alos Range faster than  trains were ever shot over the grades before, or we have failed,\" said  Mr. Bartholomew, with decision.    \"But--\" began Ned; but Tom put up an arresting hand and his financial  manager ceased speaking.    \"I have not forgotten the details of our contract, Mr. Bartholomew,\" he  said, quietly. \"Two-miles-a-minute is the target I have aimed for.  Whether I have hit it or not, well, time will show. I have got to try  the locomotive out on the tracks of the H. & P. A. in any case. The  Hercules Three-Oughts-One has been dragged a long distance, and has  been through at least one wreck.  I want to see if she is all right  before I test her officially.\"    \"I'll arrange that for you,\" said Mr. Bartholomew, briskly, putting  away his papers. \"I will go with you, too, and take a look at the  marvel.\"    \"And a marvel it is,\" grumbled Ned. \"Don't let him fool you, Mr.  Bartholomew. Tom never does consider what he's done as being as great  as it really is.\"    \"Everything must be proved,\" Tom said, cautiously. \"If it was a  financial problem, Mr. Bartholomew, believe me it would be Ned who  displayed caution. But I have seldom built anything that could not--and  has not--later been improved.\"    \"You do not consider your electric locomotive, then, a completed  invention?\" asked Mr. Bartholomew, as the three walked down the yard.    \"I have too much experience to say it is perfect,\" returned Tom. \"I can  scarcely believe, even, that it is going to suit you, Mr. Bartholomew,  even if the speed test is as promising as I hope it may be.\"    \"Humph!\"    \"But before I shall be willing to throw up the sponge and say that I  have failed, I shall monkey with the Hercules Three-Oughts-One quite a  little on your tracks.\"    \"Your six months isn't up yet,\" said Mr. Bartholomew, more cheerfully.  \"And it doesn't matter if it is. If you see any chance of making a  success of your invention, you are welcome to try it out on the tracks  of the H. & P. A. for another six months.\"    \"All right,\" Tom said, smiling. \"Now, there is the Hercules  Three-Oughts-One, Mr. Bartholomew. And there is Koku looking longingly  through the window.\"    In fact, the giant, the moment he saw Tom, ran to unbar and open the  door of the cab on that side.    \"Master! If no let Koku out, Koku go amuck--crazy! No can breathe in  here! No can eat! No can sleep!\"    \"The poor fellow!\" ejaculated Ned.    \"What's the matter with him?\" asked Mr. Bartholomew, curiously.    \"Get out, if you want to, Koku. I'll stay by while you kick up your  heels.\"    No sooner had the inventor spoken than the giant leaped from the open  door of the locomotive and dashed away along the cinder path as though  he actually had to run away. Tom burst into a laugh, as he watched the  giant disappear beyond the strings of freight cars.    \"What is the matter with him?\" repeated the railroad president.    \"He's got the cramp all right,\" laughed Tom Swift. \"You don't  understand, Mr. Bartholomew, what it means to that big fellow to be  housed in for so many days, and unable to kick a free limb. I bet he  runs ten miles before he stops.\"    \"The police will arrest him,\" said the railroad man.    It was then Ned's turn to chuckle. \"I am sorry for your railroad police  if they tackle Koku right now,\" he said. \"He'd lay out about a dozen  ordinary men without half trying. But, ordinarily, he is the most  mild-mannered fellow who ever lived.\"    \"He will come back, if he is let alone, as harmless as a kitten,\" Tom  observed. \"And when I am not with the Hercules Three-Oughts-One, and  while I continue making my tests, Koku will be on guard. You might tell  your police force, Mr. Bartholomew, to let him alone. Now come aboard  and let me show you what I have been trying to do.\"    They spent two hours inside the cab of the great locomotive.  Mr.  Richard Bartholomew was possessed of no small degree of mechanical  education. He might not be a genius in mechanics as Tom Swift was, but  he could follow the latter's explanations regarding the improvements in  the electrical equipment of this new type of locomotive.    \"I don't know what your speed tests will show, Mr. Swift,\" said the  railroad president, with added enthusiasm. \"But if those parts will do  what you say they have already done, you've got the Jandels beat a  mile! I'm for you, strong. Yes, sir! like your friend, Newton, here, I  believe that you have hit the right track. You are going to triumph.\"    But Tom's triumph did not come at once. He knew more about the  uncertainties of mechanical contrivances than did either Mr.  Bartholomew or Ned Newton.    The very next day the Hercules 0001 was got out upon a section of the  electrified system of the Hendrickton & Pas Alos Railway, and the  pantagraphs of the huge locomotive for the first time came into  connection with the twin conductor trolleys which overhung the rails.    Ned accompanied Tom as assistant. Koku was allowed by the inventor to  roam about the hills as much as he pleased during the hours in which  his master was engaged with the Hercules 0001. Tom did not think any  harm would come to Koku, and he knew that the giant would enjoy  immensely a free foot in such a wild country.  The two young fellows,  dressed in working suits of overall stuff, spent long hours in the cab  of the electric locomotive. Their try-outs had to be made for the most  part on sidetracks and freight switches, some miles outside  Hendrickton, where the invention would not be in the way of regular  traffic.    Speed on level tracks had been raised in one test to over ninety-five  miles an hour and Mr. Bartholomew cheered wildly from the cab of a huge  Mallet that paced Tom's locomotive on a parallel track. No steam  locomotive had ever made such fast time.    But Tom was after something bigger than this. He wanted to show the  president of the H. & P. A. that the Hercules 0001 could drag a load  over the Pas Alos Range at a pace never before gained by any  mountain-hog.    Therefore he coaxed the electric locomotive out into the hills, some  hundred or more miles from headquarters. He had to keep in touch with  the train dispatcher's office, of course; the new machine had often to  take a sidetrack. Nor was much of this hilly right-of-way electrified.  The Jandels locomotive had been found to be a failure on the sharp  grades; so the extension of the trolley system had been abandoned.    But there was one steep grade between Hammon and Cliff City that had  been completed. The current could be fed to the cables over this  stretch of track, and for a week Tom used this long and steep grade  just as much as he could, considering of course the demands of the  regular traffic.    The telegraph operator at Half Way (merely a name for a station, for  there was not a habitation in sight) thrust his long upper-length out  of the telegraph office window one afternoon and waved a \"highball\" to  the waiting electric locomotive on the sidetrack.    \"Dispatcher says you can have Track Number Two West till the  four-thirteen, westbound, is due. I'll slip the operator at Cliff City  the news and he'll be on the lookout for you as well as me, Mr. Swift.  Go to it.\"    Every man on the system was interested, and most of them enthusiastic,  about Tom's invention. The latter knew that he could depend upon this  operator and his mate to watch out for the western-bound flyer that  would begin its climb of the grade at Hammon less than half an hour  hence.    The electric locomotive was coaxed out across the switch. Tom was  earnestly inspecting the more delicate parts of the mechanism while Ned  (and proud he was to do it) handled the levers. Once on the main line  he moved the controller forward. The machine began to pick up speed.    The drumming of the wheels over the rail joints became a single  note--an increasing roar of sound. The electric locomotive shot up the  grade. The arrow on the speedometer crept around the dial and Ned's eye  was more often fastened on that than it was on the glistening twin  rails which mounted the grade.    Black-green hemlock and spruce bordered the right of way on either  hand. Their shadows made the tunnel through the forest almost dark. But  Tom had not seen fit to turn"]]]
