In Christian circles, however, the       abstinence was practised on personal and spiritual grounds, _e.g._,       Jerome (_de Regul. Monach._, xi.) says, \"The eating of flesh is the       seed-plot of lust\" (_seminarium libidinis_): so also Augustine (_de       moribus Ecc. Cath._, i. 33), who supports what doubtless was the       view of Prudentius, namely that the avoidance of animal flesh was a       safe-guard but not a binding Christian duty.    75     _Unwed._ Prudentius thus adopts the view of the ancient world on       the question of the generation of bees. Cf. Virgil, _Geo._ iv. 198,       and Pliny, _Nat. Hist._, xi. 16. Dryden's translation of Virgil       (_l.c._) is as follows:--              \"But (what's more strange) their modest appetites,            Averse from Venus, fly the nuptial rights;            No lust enervates their heroic mind,            Nor wastes their strength on wanton womankind,            But in their mouths reside their genial powers,            They gather children from the leaves and flowers.\"    86     Cf. Ps. liv. 18, 19 (Vulg.): _Vespere et mane et meridie narrabo       et annuntiabo et exaudiet vocem meam._ \"In the evening and morning       and at noonday will I pray, and that instantly and he shall hear my       voice\" (P. B. Version).    127     This is, strictly speaking, an error: it is the woman's seed       which is to bruise the serpent's head. The error was perpetuated       in the Latin Church by the Vulgate of Gen. iii. 15, _ipsa conteret       caput tuum_, where _ipsa_ refers to the woman (= she herself).    157     The epithet \"white-robed\" refers to the newly-baptized converts       who received the white robe as a symbol of their new nature. Cf.       _Perist._ i. 67: _Christus illic candidatis praesidet cohortibus_,       and Ambrose (_de Mysteriis_, vii.): \"Thou didst receive (that is,       after baptism) white garments as a sign that thou hast doffed the       covering of thy sins and put on the chaste raiment (_velamina_) of       innocence, whereof the prophet spake (Ps. li. 7), 'Thou shalt purge       me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou shalt wash me, and I       shall be whiter than snow'\" (Vulg.).    199     Phlegethon (rendered \"Hell\"), one of the rivers of the Virgilian       Hades, is used to express the abode of the lost. Cf. Milton, _P. L._,       ii. 580:--                    \"... fierce Phlegethon,            Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\"         The subject of the _descensus ad inferos_ was evidently a favourite       one with Prudentius and his contemporaries. It has been suggested       that apart from the scriptural basis of this conception Prudentius       was influenced by the so-called _Gospel of Nicodemus_, which embodies       two books, the _Acts of Pilate_ and the _Descent into Hell_. The       latter is assigned by several critics to 400 or thereabouts, and       gives a graphic account of Christ's doings in Hades. Synesius deals       with the subject in one of his hymns (ix.), and Mrs Browning's       translation (see the essay on _The Greek Christian Poets_) of a       passage in that poem may be quoted:--              \"Down Thou earnest, low as earth,            Bound to those of mortal birth;            Down Thou earnest, low as hell,            Where Shepherd-Death did tend and keep            A thousand nations like to sheep,            While weak with age old Hades fell            Shivering through his dark to view Thee.                *       *       *       *       *              So, redeeming from their pain            Chains of disembodied ones,            Thou didst lead whom thou didst gather            Upward in ascent again,            With a great hymn to the Father,            Upward to the pure white thrones!\"         For a modern treatment of the theme see _Christ in Hades_, by       Stephen Phillips.    202     The words suggest the Catacombs, and perhaps refer to the custom       of placing in the tomb a small cup or vase containing spices, of       which myrrh (a symbol of death, according to Gregory of Nyssa, cf.       xii. 71) was most usually employed. Or the allusion may be to the       practice of embalming. (See note on x. 51.) The body was placed       not only in an actual sarcophagus or stone coffin, as expressly       mentioned in the text, but in hollow places cut out of rock or       earth (_loculus_). The _sarcophagus_ method seems to have been the       earlier, but was superseded by that of the _loculus_, except in the       case of the very wealthy.    205     The concluding line is beautifully illustrated by the epitaph       on the martyr Alexander, found over one of the graves in the cemetery       of Callixtus in the Catacombs:--              ALEXANDER MORTVVS NON EST SED VIVIT            SVPER ASTRA ET CORPVS IN HOC TVMVLO            QVIESCIT ...              \"Alexander is not dead, but lives above the stars                and his body rests in this tomb.\"                                         IV    15     Prudentius here, as again in v. 160, emphasises his belief in       the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son. The       \"filioque\" clause was not actually added to the Nicene Creed till       the Council of Toledo (589 A.D.), but the doctrine was expressly       maintained by Augustine, and occurs in a Confession of Faith of an       earlier Synod of Toledo (447 A.D.?), and in the words of Leo I.       (_Ep. ad Turib._, c. 1), \"_de utroque processit._\" The addition       was not embodied into the Creed as used at Rome as late as the       beginning of the ninth century. (_Vid._ Harnack, _Hist. of Dogma_,       iv. 132.) Prudentius probably followed, as regards the Trinity,       the doctrine generally held by the Spanish Church of his day; in       many points it is difficult (cf. note on iii. 2), but appears to be       derived partly from Tertullian and partly from Marcellus.    59     The identification of the Habakkuk of this legend (_vid._ the       Apocryphal \"Bel and the Dragon\") with the O. T. prophet is erroneous.       This version of the story of Daniel is sometimes represented in the       frescoes of the Catacombs, where the subject is a very favourite       one, as is natural in an age when the cry \"_Christiani ad leones_\"       so often rang through the streets of Rome.                                         V    1     There has been much doubt as to the title and scope of this hymn.       Some early editors (_e.g._, Fabricius and Arevalus) adopt the title       \"_ad incensum cerei Paschalis_,\" or \"_de novo lumine Paschalis       Sabbati_,\" and confine its object to the ceremonial of Easter Eve,       which is specially alluded to in ll. 125 _et seq._ Others, following       the best MSS., give the simpler title used in this text, and regard       it as a hymn for daily use. This view is supported by the weight       of evidence: the position of the hymn among the first six (none of       which are for special days), and the fact that the Benediction of       the Paschal Candle was not in use, at any rate in Rome, in the       pontificate of Zacharias (_ob._ 752 A.D.) point in this direction.       In the Spanish Church particularly the very ancient custom of       praying at the hour when the evening lamps were lighted had developed       into the regular office of the _lucernarium_, as distinct from       Vespers. The Mozarabic Breviary (seventh century) contains the       prayers and responses for this service, and the Rule of St. Isidore       runs: \"In the evening offices, first the lucernarium, then two       psalms, one responsory and lauds, a hymn and prayer are to be       said.\" St. Basil also writes: \"It seemed good to our fathers not       to receive in silence the gift of the evening light, but to give       thanks as soon as it appeared.\" It is probable, therefore, that       Prudentius intended the hymn for daily use, and that after speaking       of God as the source of light, and His manifestations in the form       of fire to Moses and the Israelites, his thoughts pass naturally,       though somewhat abruptly, to the special festival--Easter Eve--on       which the sanctuaries were most brilliantly illuminated. The       question is fully discussed by Brockhaus (_A. Prudentius Clemens       in seiner Bedeutung fuer die Kirche seiner Zeit_), and Roesler (_Der       catholische Dichter A. Prudentius_). Part of this hymn is used in       the Mozarabic Breviary for the First Sunday after Epiphany, at       Vespers, being stanzas 1, 7, 35, 38-41.    7     The words _incussu silicis_ are perhaps reminiscent of the Spanish       ceremonial of Easter Eve, when the bishop struck the flint, lighting       from it first a candle, then a lamp, from which the deacons lighted       their candles; these were blessed by the bishop, and the procession       from the _processus_ into the church followed.    21     Cf. Vaughan, _The Lampe_:--                        \"Then thou dost weepe            Still as thou burn'st, and the warm droppings creepe            To measure out thy length.\"    119     The _folium_ here is probably the ancient _malobathrum_, generally       identified as the Indian cinnamon. The Arab traders who brought this       valuable product into the Western markets, surrounded its origin with       much mystery.    125     The following stanzas, in which Prudentius elaborates the       beautiful fancy that the sufferings of lost spirits are alleviated       at Eastertide, have incurred the severe censure of some of the       earlier editors. Fabricius calls it \"a Spanish fabrication,\" while       others, as Cardinal Bellarmine, declare that the author is speaking       \"poetically and not dogmatically.\" That such a belief, however, was       actually held by some section of the ancient"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14969"],[0,"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (#18)"],[1,"z., that the sexual tension which brings about a  substitute for the sexual act by the short hallucinatory road is a  function of the accumulated semen in the reservoirs for the sexual  products. Experiences with the exhaustibility of the sexual mechanism  speak for the same thing. Where there is no stock of semen it is not  only impossible to accomplish the sexual act, but there is also a lack  of excitability in the erogenous zones, the suitable excitation of which  can evoke no pleasure. We thus discover incidentally that a certain  amount of sexual tension is itself necessary for the excitability of the  erogenous zones.    One would thus be forced to the assumption, which if I am not mistaken  is quite generally adopted, that the accumulation of sexual substance  produces and maintains the sexual tension. The pressure of these  products on the walls of their receptacles acts as an excitant on the  spinal center, the state of which is then perceived by the higher  centers which then produce in consciousness the familiar feeling of  tension. If the excitation of erogenous zones increases the sexual  tension, it can only be due to the fact that the erogenous zones are  connected with these centers by previously formed anatomical  connections. They increase there the tone of the excitation, and with  sufficient sexual tension they set in motion the sexual act, and with  insufficient tension they merely stimulate a production of the sexual  substance.    The weakness of the theory which one finds adopted, _e.g._, in v.  Krafft-Ebing's description of the sexual process, lies in the fact that  it has been formed for the sexual activity of the mature man and pays  too little heed to three kinds of relations which should also have been  elucidated. We refer to the relations as found in the child, in the  woman, and in the castrated male. In none of the three cases can we  speak of an accumulation of sexual products in the same sense as in the  man, which naturally renders difficult the general application of this  scheme; still it may be admitted without any further ado that ways can  be found to justify the subordination of even these cases. Nevertheless  one should be cautious about burdening the factor of accumulation of  sexual products with actions which it seems incapable of supporting.    *Overestimation of the Internal Genitals.*--That sexual excitement can  be independent to a considerable extent of the production of sexual  substance seems to be shown by observations on castrated males, in whom  the libido sometimes escapes the injury caused by the operation,  although the opposite behavior, which is really the motive for the  operation, is usually the rule. It is therefore not at all surprising,  as C. Rieger puts it, that the loss of the male germ glands in maturer  age should exert no new influence on the psychic life of the individual.  The germ glands are really not the sexuality, and the experience with  castrated males only verifies what we had long before learned from the  removal of the ovaries, namely that it is impossible to do away with the  sexual character by removing the germ glands. To be sure, castration  performed at a tender age, before puberty, comes nearer to this aim, but  it would seem in this case that besides the loss of the sexual glands we  must also consider the inhibition of development and other factors  which are connected with that loss.    *Chemical Theories.*--The truth remains, however, that we are unable to  give any information about the nature of the sexual excitement for the  reason that we do not know with what organ or organs sexuality is  connected, since we have seen that the sexual glands have been  overestimated in this significance. Since surprising discoveries have  taught us the important role of the thyroid gland in sexuality, we may  assume that the knowledge of the essential factors of sexuality are  still withheld from us. One who feels the need of filling up the large  gap in our knowledge with a preliminary assumption may formulate for  himself the following theory based on the active substances found in the  thyroid. Through the appropriate excitement of erogenous zones, as well  as through other conditions under which sexual excitement originates, a  material which is universally distributed in the organism becomes  disintegrated, the decomposing products of which supply a specific  stimulus to the organs of reproduction or to the spinal center connected  with them. Such a transformation of a toxic stimulus in a particular  organic stimulus we are already familiar with from other toxic products  introduced into the body from without. To treat, if only hypothetically,  the complexities of the pure toxic and the physiologic stimulations  which result in the sexual processes is not now our appropriate task. To  be sure, I attach no value to this special assumption and I shall be  quite ready to give it up in favor of another, provided its original  character, the emphasis on the sexual chemism, were preserved. For this  apparently arbitrary statement is supported by a fact which, though  little heeded, is most noteworthy. The neuroses which can be traced only  to disturbances of the sexual life show the greatest clinical  resemblance to the phenomena of intoxication and abstinence which result  from the habitual introduction of pleasure-producing poisonous  substances (alkaloids.)      THE THEORY OF THE LIBIDO    These assumptions concerning the chemical basis of the sexual excitement  are in full accord with the auxiliary conception which we formed for the  purpose of mastering the psychic manifestations of the sexual life. We  have determined the concept of _libido_ as that of a force of variable  quantity which has the capacity of measuring processes and  transformations in the spheres of sexual excitement. This libido we  distinguished from the energy which is to be generally adjudged to the  psychic processes with reference to its special origin and thus we  attribute to it also a qualitative character. In separating libidinous  from other psychic energy we give expression to the assumption that the  sexual processes of the organism are differentiated from the nutritional  processes through a special chemism. The analyses of perversions and  psychoneuroses have taught us that this sexual excitement is furnished  not only from the so-called sexual parts alone but from all organs of  the body. We thus formulate for ourselves the concept of a  libido-quantum whose psychic representative we designate as the  ego-libido; the production, increase, distribution and displacement of  this ego-libido will offer the possible explanation for the observed  psycho-sexual phenomena.    But this ego-libido becomes conveniently accessible to psychoanalytic  study only when the psychic energy is employed on sexual objects, that  is when it becomes object libido. Then we see it as it concentrates and  fixes itself on objects, or as it leaves those objects and passes over  to others from which positions it directs the individual's sexual  activity, that is, it leads to partial and temporary extinction of the  libido. Psychoanalysis of the so-called transference neuroses (hysteria  and compulsion neurosis) offers us here a reliable insight.    Concerning the fates of the object libido we also state that it is  withdrawn from the object, that it is preserved floating in special  states of tension and is finally taken back into the ego, so that it  again becomes ego-libido. In contradistinction to the object-libido we  also call the ego-libido narcissistic libido. From psychoanalysis we  look over the boundary which we are not permitted to pass into the  activity of the narcissistic libido and thus form an idea of the  relations between the two. The narcissistic or ego-libido appears to us  as the great reservoir from which the energy for the investment of the  object is sent out and into which it is drawn back again, while the  narcissistic libido investment of the ego appears to us as the realized  primitive state in the first childhood, which only becomes hidden by the  later emissions of the libido, and is retained at the bottom behind  them.    The task of a theory of libido of neurotic and psychotic disturbances  would have for its object to express in terms of the libido-economy all  observed phenomena and disclosed processes. It is easy to divine that  the greater significance would attach thereby to the destinies of the  ego-libido, especially where it would be the question of explaining the  deeper psychotic disturbances. The difficulty then lies in the fact that  the means of our investigation, psychoanalysis, at present gives us  definite information only concerning the transformation of the  object-libido, but cannot distinguish without further study the  ego-libido from the other effective energies in the ego.[3]      DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN    It is known that the sharp differentiation of the male and female  character originates at puberty, and it is the resulting difference  which, more than any other factor, decisively influences the later  development of personality. To be sure, the male and female dispositions  are easily recognizable even in infantile life; thus the development of  sexual inhibitions (shame, loathing, sympathy, etc.) ensues earlier and  with less resistance in the little girl than in the little boy. The  tendency to sexual repression certainly seems much greater, and where  partial impulses of sexuality are noticed they show a preference for the  passive form. But, the autoerotic activity of the erogenous zones is the  same in both sexes, and it is this agreement that removes the  possibility of a sex differentiation in childhood as it appears after  puberty. In respect to the autoerotic and masturbatic sexual  manifestations, it may be asserted that the sexuality of the little girl  has entirely a male character."]]]
