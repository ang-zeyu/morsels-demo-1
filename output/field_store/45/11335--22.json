If God vouchsafes to grant me a  few more years of life, I must then see you once more, my dear, most dear  friend, for the voice within, to which I always listen, demands this.  Spirits may love one another, and I shall ever woo yours. Your approval is  dearer to me than all else in the world. I told Goethe my sentiments as to  the influence praise has over men like us, and that we desire our equals to  listen to us with their understanding. Emotion suits women only; (forgive  me!) music ought to strike fire from the soul of a man. Ah! my dear girl,  how long have our feelings been identical on all points!!! The sole real  good is some bright kindly spirit to sympathize with us, whom we thoroughly  comprehend, and from whom we need not hide our thoughts. _He who wishes to  appear something, must in reality be something._ The world must acknowledge  us, it is not always unjust; but for this I care not, having a higher  purpose in view. I hope to get a letter from you in Vienna; write to me  soon and fully, for a week hence I shall be there. The Court leaves this  to-morrow, and to-day they have another performance. The Empress has  studied her part thoroughly. The Emperor and the Duke wished me to play  some of my own music, but I refused, for they are both infatuated with  _Chinese porcelain_. A little indulgence is required, for reason seems to  have lost its empire; but I do not choose to minister to such perverse  folly--I will not be a party to such absurd doings to please those princes  who are constantly guilty of eccentricities of this sort. Adieu! adieu!  dear one; your letter lay all night next my heart, and cheered me.  Musicians permit themselves great license. _Heavens! how I love you!_ Your  most faithful friend and deaf brother,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Fraeulein Giannatasio del Rio, in the journal she sent to the  _Grenz Boten_ in 1857, states that Beethoven once declared, \"It is very  pleasant to associate with the great of the earth, but one must possess  some quality which inspires them with respect.\"]    [Footnote 2: According to Bettina (see _Goethe's Correspondence with a  Child_, II. 193), their first acquaintance was made in Beethoven's  apartments.]      94.    TO PRINCESS KINSKY,--PRAGUE    Vienna, Dec. 30, 1812.    YOUR HIGHNESS,--    The dreadful event which deprived you of your husband, Prince von Kinsky,  snatching him from his father-land and from all those who love him,[1] as  well as from many whom he generously supported, filling every heart capable  of appreciating goodness and greatness with the deepest sorrow, affected me  also in the most profound and painful degree. The stern duty of  self-interest compels me to lay before your Highness a humble petition, the  reasonable purport of which may, I hope, plead my excuse for intruding on  your Highness at a time when so many affairs of importance claim your  attention. Permit me to state the matter to your Highness.    Y.H. is no doubt aware that when I received a summons to Westphalia in the  year 1809, his Highness Prince von Kinsky, your late husband, together with  his I.H. Archduke Rudolph and H.H. the Prince von Lobkowitz, offered to  settle on me for life an annual income of 4000 gulden, provided I declined  the proposal in question, and determined to remain in Austria. Although  this sum was by no means in proportion to that secured to me in Westphalia,  still my predilection for Austria, as well as my sense of this most  generous proposal, induced me to accept it without hesitation. The share  contributed by H.H. Prince Kinsky consisted of 1800 florins, which I have  received by quarterly instalments since 1809 from the Prince's privy purse.  Though subsequent occurrences partially diminished this sum, I rested  satisfied, till the appearance of the Finance Patent, reducing bank-notes  into _Einloesung Schein_. I applied to H.I.H. the Archduke Rudolph to  request that the portion of the annuity contributed by H.I.H. should in  future be paid in _Einloesung Schein_. This was at once granted, and I  received a written assurance to that effect from H.I.H. Prince von  Lobkowitz agreed to the same with regard to his share,--700 florins [see  No. 84]. H.H. Prince von Kinsky being at that time in Prague, I addressed  my respectful petition to him last May, through Herr Varnhagen von Ense, an  officer in the Vogelsang Regiment, that his Highness's contribution to my  salary--1800 florins--should be paid like the rest in _Einloesung Schein_.  Herr von Varnhagen wrote as follows, and the original of the letter is  still extant:--    \"I had yesterday the desired interview with Prince Kinsky. With the highest  praise of Beethoven, he at once acceded to his demand, and is prepared to  pay up the arrears, and also all future sums from the date of the  _Einloesung Schein_, in that currency. The cashier here has received the  necessary instructions, and Beethoven can draw for the whole sum on his way  through Prague, or, if he prefers it, in Vienna, as soon as the Prince  returns there.    \"Prague, June 9, 1812.\"    When passing through Prague some weeks afterwards, I took the opportunity  of waiting on the Prince, and received from him the fullest confirmation of  this promise. H.H. likewise assured me that he entirely admitted the  propriety of my demand, and considered it quite reasonable. As I could not  remain in Prague till this affair was finally settled, H.H. was so kind as  to make me a payment of sixty ducats on account, which, according to H.H.'s  calculation, were good for 600 florins Vienna currency. The arrears were to  be paid up on my return to Vienna, and an order given to the cashier to pay  my salary in future in _Einloesung Schein_. Such was H.H.'s pleasure. My  illness increasing in Toeplitz, I was obliged to remain there longer than I  originally intended. In the month of September I therefore addressed to  H.H., who was then in Vienna, through one of my friends here, Herr Oliva, a  written memorial, claiming his promise, when H.H. graciously repeated to  this friend the assurance he had already given me, adding that in the  course of a few days he would give the necessary instructions on the  subject to his cashier.    A short time afterwards he left Vienna. When I arrived there, I inquired  from the Prince's secretary whether H.H. had given directions about my  salary before leaving Vienna, when, to my surprise, I was told that H.H.  had done nothing in the matter.    My title to the liquidation of my claim is proved by the testimony of the  Herren von Varnhagen and Oliva, to whom H.H. spoke on the subject,  reiterating his consent. I feel convinced that the illustrious heirs and  family of this prince will in the same spirit of benevolence and generosity  strive to fulfil his intentions. I therefore confidently place in Y.H.'s  hands my respectful petition, viz., \"to pay up the arrears of my salary in  _Einloesung Schein_, and to instruct your cashier to transmit me the amount  in future, in the same currency.\" Relying on your sense of justice  according me a favorable decision, I remain Y.H.'s    Most obedient servant,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Prince Josef Ferdinand Kinsky, born December, 1781, and killed  by a fall from his horse, November 3, 1812.]      95.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1813.[1]    I have been far from well since last Sunday, but have suffered more in mind  than in body. I beg your forgiveness a thousand times for not having sooner  sent my apologies; each day I had the strongest inclination to wait on you,  but Heaven knows that in spite of the best will that I always entertain for  the best of masters I was unable to do so, distressing as it is to me not  to have it in my power to sacrifice all to him for whom I cherish the  highest esteem, love, and veneration. Y.R.H. would perhaps act wisely in  making a pause at present with the Lobkowitz concerts; even the most  brilliant talent may lose its effect by too great familiarity.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: Prince Franz Josef Lobkowitz died December 25th, 1816. His  musical meetings were certainly continued till 1813, or longer.]      96.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1813.[1]    At early dawn to-morrow the copyist shall begin the last movement. As I am  in the mean time writing several other works, I did not hurry myself much  with this last movement merely for the sake of punctuality, especially as I  must write this more deliberately, with a view to Rode's[2] playing; we  like quick, full-toned passages in our _Finales_, which do not suit R., and  this rather cramps me. At all events, all is sure to go well next Tuesday.  I very much doubt whether I shall be able to present myself at Y.R.H.'s on  that evening, in spite of my zeal in your service; but to make up for this,  I mean to come to you to-morrow forenoon and to-morrow afternoon, that I  may entirely fulfil the wishes of my illustrious pupil.    [K.]    [Footnote 1: 1813. January-February.]    [Footnote 2: Pierre Rode, the violinist, arrived in Vienna in January,  1813, and gave a concert in the Redoutensaal on February 6th, but did not  give universal satisfaction (_A.M.Z._, 1813, p. 114), and a second concert  that he had projected does not appear to have taken place. He played in  Gratz on February 20th and 27th. It seems that Rode was to play with  Beethoven at the Archduke Rudolph's, for which occasion Beethoven prepared  a composition for them both. Was this the Sonata for pianoforte and violin,  Op. 36, which he afterwards dedicated to the Archduke? Thayer states that  it was written by Beethoven in 1810, and sold to the music-publisher  Steiner in Vienna in April, 1815. No other composition for the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#18)"],[1,"renewed his vows of amendment.    After this acquittal a friend of his was so kind as to take him down to  his house in the country, in hopes of keeping him out of harm's way; and  indeed 'tis highly probable that he had totally given over all evil  intention of that sort, when he was unfortunately impeached by Hawkins,  one of his old companions, and on his evidence and that of the  prosecutor whom he found out, Wright was taken up, tried and convicted  at the Old Bailey. When he perceived there was no hope of life he  applied himself to the great business of his soul, and behaved with the  greatest composure imaginable. He declared himself a Roman Catholic, yet  frequented the chapel all the time he was in Newgate, and seemed only  studious how to make peace with God.    When the fatal day of execution approached, he was far from seeming  amazed, notwithstanding that after mature deliberation he refused to  declare his associates, or how they might be found, saying that perhaps  they might repent, and he hoped some of them had done so, and he would  not bring them to the same ignominious death with himself. The fact he  died for, viz., robbing Mr. Towers, with some ladies in a coach in  Marlborough Street, he confessed, also that his companion called out to  him, _What, do they resist? Shoot 'em._ He suffered with all the outward  signs of penitence, on the 22nd of December, 1721, being about  thirty-four years of age.          The Life of NATHANIEL HAWES, a Thief and a Robber      Amongst many odd notions which are picked up by the common people, there  is none more dangerous, both to themselves and unto others, than the  idea they get of courage, which with them consists either in a furious  madness, or an obstinate perseverence, even in the worst cause.    Nathaniel Hawes was a very extraordinary instance of this, as the  following part of his life will show. He was, as he said himself, the  son of a very rich grazier in Norfolk, who dying when he was but a year  old, he afterwards pretended that he was defrauded of a greater part of  his father's effects which should have belonged to him. However, those  who took care of his education put him out apprentice to an upholsterer,  with whom having served about four years, he then fell into very  expensive company, which reduced him to such straits as obliged him to  make bold with his master's cash, by which he injured him for some time  with impunity. But proceeding, at last, to the commission of a downright  robbery, he was therein detected, tried and convicted, but being then a  very young man, the Court had pity on him, and he had the good luck to  procure a pardon.    Natt made the old use of mercy, when extended to such sort of people,  that is, when he returned to liberty he returned to his old practices.  His companions were several young men of the same stamp with himself,  who placed all their delight in the sensual and brutal pleasures of  drinking, gaming, whoring and idling about, without betaking themselves  to any business. Natt, who was a young fellow naturally sprightly and of  good parts, from thence became very acceptable to these sort of people,  and committed abundance of robberies in a very small space of time. The  natural fire of his temper made him behave with great boldness on such  occasions, and gave him no small reputation amongst the gang. Seeing  himself extravagantly commended on such occasions, Hawes began to form  to himself high notions of heroism in that way, and from the warmth of a  lively imagination, became a downright Don Quixote in all their  adventures. He particularly affected the company of Richard James, and  with him robbed very much on the Oxford Road, whereon it was common for  both these persons not only to take away the money from passengers, but  also to treat them with great inhumanity, which for all I might know  might arise in a great measure from Hawes's whimsical notions.    This fellow was so puffed up with the reputation he had got amongst his  companions in the same miserable occupation, that he fancied no  expedition impracticable which he thought fit to engage, and indeed the  boldness of his attempts had so often given him success that there is no  wonder a fellow of his small parts and education should conceive so  highly of himself. It was nothing for Hawes singly to rob a coach full  of gentlemen, to stop two or three persons on the highway at a time, or  to rob the waggons in a line as they came on the Oxford Road to London,  nor was there any of the little prisons or Bridewells that could hold  him.    There was, however, an adventure of Natt's of this kind that deserves a  particular relation. He had, it seems, been so unlucky as to be taken  and committed to New Prison,[14] on suspicion of robbing two gentlemen  in a chaise coming from Hampstead. Hawes viewed well the place of his  confinement, but found it much too strong for any attempts like those he  was wont to make. In the same place with himself and another man mere  was a woman very genteelly dressed, who had been committed for  shoplifting. This woman seemed even more ready to attempt something  which might get her out of that confinement than either Hawes or her  other companion. The latter said it was impracticable, and Natt that  though he had broken open many a prison, yet he saw no probability of  putting this in the number.    _Well_, said the woman _have you courage enough to try, if I put you in  the way? Yes_, quoth Hawes, _there's nothing I won't undertake for  liberty;_ and said the other fellow, _If I once saw a likelihood of  performing it, there's nobody has better hands at such work than myself.  In the first place_, said this politician in petticoats, _we must raise  as much money amongst us as will keep a very good fire. Why truly_,  replied Hawes, _a fire would be convenient in this cold weather, but I  can't, for my heart, see how we should be nearer our liberty for it,  unless you intend to set the gaol in flames. Tush! Tush!_ answered the  woman, _follow but my directions, and let's have some faggots and coals,  and I warrant you by to-morrow morning we shall be safe oat of these  regions._ The woman spoke this with so much assurance that Hawes and the  other man complied, and reserving but one shilling, laid out all their  money in combustibles and liquor. While the runners of the prison were  going to and fro upon this occasion, the woman seemed so dejected that  she could scarce speak, and the two men by her directions sat with the  same air as if the rope already had been about them at Tyburn. At last,  as they were going to be locked up; _Pray_, says the woman, with a  faint voice, _Can't you give me something like a poker? Why, yes_, says  one of the fellows belonging to the gaol, _if you'll give me twopence,  I'll bring you one of the old bars that was taken out of the window when  these new ones were put in._ The woman gave him the halfpence, he  delivered the bar, and the keepers having locked them up, barred and  bolted the doors, and left them until next morning.    As soon as ever the people of the gaol were gone, up starts madam. _Now,  my lads_, says she, _to work_; and putting her hands into her pockets  and shaking her petticoats, down drops two little bags of tools. She  pointed out to them a large stone at the corner of the roof which was  morticed into two others, one above and the other below. After they had  picked all the mortar from between them, she heated the bar red hot in  the fire, and putting it to the sockets into which the irons that held  the stones were fastened with lead, it quickly loosened them, and then  making use of the bars as of a crow, by two o'clock in the morning they  had got them all three out, and opened a fair passage into the streets,  only that it was a little too high. Upon this the woman made them fasten  the iron bar strongly at the angle where the three stones met, and then  pulling off her stays, she unrolled from the top of her petticoats four  yards of strong cord, the noose of which being fastened on the iron, the  other end was thrown out over the wall, and so the descent was rendered  easy. The men were equally pleased and surprised at their good fortune,  and in gratitude to the female author of it, helped her to the top of  the wall, and let her get safe over before they attempted to go out  themselves.    It was not long after this that Hawes committed a robbery on Finchley  Common, upon one Richard Hall, from whom he took about four shillings in  money; and to make up the badness of the booty, he took from him his  horse, in order to be the better equipped to go in quest of another  which might make up the deficiency. For this robbery, being shortly  after detected and apprehended, he was convicted and received sentence  of death. When first confined, he behaved himself with very great  levity, and declared he would merit a greater reputation by the boldness  of his behaviour than any highwayman that had died these seven years.  Indeed, this was the style he always made use of, and the great  affectation of intrepidity and resolution which he always put on would  have moved anybody (had it not been for his melancholy condition) to  smile at the vanity of the man.    At the time he was taken up, he had, it seems, a good suit of clothes  taken from him, which put him so much out of humour, because he could  not appear, as he said, like a gentleman at the sessions-house, that  when he was arraigned and should have put himself upon his trial, he  refused to plead unless they were delivered to him again. But to this  the Court answered that it was not in their power, and on his persisting  to remain mute, after all the exhortations which were made to him, the  Court at last ordered that the sentence of the press should be read to  him, as is customary on such occasions; after which the Judge from the  Bench spoke to him to this effect"]]]
