This condition may be  otherwise expressed by saying that the period during which repulsion  occurs includes all the maxima of current, while the period of  attraction includes no maxima. There is then a _repulsion due to the  summative effects of strong opposite currents_ for a _lengthened  period_, against an _attraction_ due to the summative effects of _weak  currents_ of the _same direction_ during a _shortened period_, the  resultant effect being a greatly _preponderating_ repulsion.    It is now not difficult to understand all the actions before described  as obtained with the varied relations of coils, magnetic fields, and  closed circuits. It will be easily understood, also, that an alternating  magnetic field is in all respects the same as an alternating current  coil in producing repulsion on the closed conductor, because the  repulsions between the two conductors are the result of magnetic  repulsions arising from opposing fields produced by the coils when the  currents are of opposite directions in them.    Thus far I have applied the repulsive action described in the  construction of alternating current indicators, alternating current arc  lamps, regulating devices for alternating currents, and to rotary motors  for such currents. For current indicators, a pivoted or suspended copper  band or ring composed of thin washers piled together and insulated from  one another, and made to carry a pointer or index has been placed in the  axis of a coil conveying alternating currents whose amount or potential  is to be indicated. Gravity or a spring is used to bring the index to  the zero of a divided scale, at which time the plane of the copper ring  or band makes an angle of, say, 15 degrees to 20 degrees with the plane  of the coil. This angle is increased by deflection more or less great,  according to the current traversing the coil. The instrument can be  calibrated for set conditions of use. Time would not permit of a full  description of these arrangements as made up to the present.    In arc lamps the magnet for forming the arc can be composed of a closed  conductor, a coil for the passage of current, and an iron wire core. The  repulsive action upon the closed conductor lifts and regulates the  carbons in much the same manner that electro magnets do when continuous  currents are used. The electro-inductive repulsive action has also been  applied to regulating devices for alternating currents, with the details  of which I cannot now deal.    For the construction of an alternating current motor which can be  started from a state of rest the principle has also been applied, and it  may here be remarked that a number of designs of such motors is  practicable.    One of the simplest is as follows: The coils, C, Fig. 14, are traversed  by an alternating current and are placed over a coil, B, mounted upon a  horizontal axis, transverse to the axis of the coil, C. The terminals of  the coil, B, which is wound with insulated wire, are carried to a  commutator, the brushes being connected by a wire, as indicated. The  commutator is so constructed as to keep the coil, B, on short circuit  from the position of coincidence with the plane of C to the position  where the plane of B is at right angles to that of C; and to keep the  coil, B, open-circuited from the right-angled position, or thereabouts,  to the position of parallel or coincident planes. The deflective  repulsion exhibited by B will, when its circuit is completed by the  commutator and brushes, as described, act to place its plane at right  angles to that of C; but being then open-circuited, its momentum carries  it to the position just past parallelism, at which moment it is again  short-circuited, and so on. It is capable of very rapid rotation, but  its energy is small. I have, however, extended the principle to the  construction of more complete apparatus. One form has its revolving  portion or armature composed of a number of sheet iron disks wound as  usual with three coils crossing near the shaft. The commutator is  arranged to short-circuit each of these coils in succession, and twice  in a revolution, and for a period of 90-degrees of rotation each. The  field coils surround the armature, and there is a laminated iron field  structure completing the magnetic circuit. I may say here that  surrounding the armature of a dynamo by the field coils, though very  recently put forth as a new departure, was described in various  Thomson-Houston patents, and to a certain extent all Thomson-Houston  machines embody this feature.    Figs. 15 and 16 will give an idea of the construction of the motor  referred to. CC' are the field coils or inducing coils, which alone are  put into the alternating current circuit. II is a mass of laminated  iron, in the interior of which the armature revolves, with its three  coils, B, B squared, B cubed, wound on a core of sheet iron disks. The commutator  short-circuits the armature coils in succession in the proper positions  to utilize the repulsive effect set up by the currents which are induced  in them by the alternations in the field coils. The motor has no dead  point, and will start from a state of rest and give out considerable  power, but with what economy is not yet known.    A curious property of the machine is that at a certain speed, depending  on the rapidity of the alternations in the coil, C, a continuous current  passes from one commutator brush to the other, and it will energize  electro magnets and perform other actions of direct currents. Here we  have, then, a means of inducing direct currents from alternating  currents. To control the speed and keep it at that required for the  purpose, we have only to properly gear the motor to another of the  ordinary type for alternating currents, namely, an alternating-current  dynamo used as a motor. The charging of storage batteries would not be  difficult with such a machine, even from an alternating-current line,  though the losses might be considerable.           *       *       *       *       *          PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY OF STELLAR SPECTRA, HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY.    HENRY DRAPER MEMORIAL.    _First Annual Report_.      Dr. Henry Draper, in 1872, was the first to photograph the lines of a  stellar spectrum. His investigation, pursued for many years with great  skill and ingenuity, was most unfortunately interrupted in 1882 by his  death.    The recent advances in dry-plate photography have vastly increased our  powers of dealing with this subject. Early in 1886, accordingly, Mrs.  Draper made a liberal provision for carrying on this investigation at  the Harvard College Observatory, as a memorial to her husband. The  results attained are described below, and show that an opportunity is  open for a very important and extensive investigation in this branch of  astronomical physics. Mrs. Draper has accordingly decided greatly to  extend the original plan of work, and to have it conducted on a scale  suited to its importance. The attempt will be made to include all  portions of the subject, so that the final results shall form a complete  discussion of the constitution and conditions of the stars, as revealed  by their spectra, so far as present scientific methods permit. It is  hoped that a greater advance will thus be made than if the subject was  divided among several institutions, or than if a broader range of  astronomical study was attempted.    It is expected that a station to be established in the southern  hemisphere will permit the work to be extended so that a similar method  of study may be applied to stars in all parts of the sky. The  investigations already undertaken, and described below more in detail,  include a catalogue of the spectra of all stars north of--24 deg. of the  sixth magnitude and brighter, a more extensive catalogue of spectra of  stars brighter than the eighth magnitude, and a detailed study of the  spectra of the bright stars.    This last will include a classification of the spectra, a determination  of the wave lengths of the lines, a comparison with terrestrial spectra,  and an application of the results to the measurement of the approach and  recession of the stars. A special photographic investigation will also  be undertaken of the spectra of the banded stars, and of the ends of the  spectra of the bright stars.    The instruments employed are an eight inch Voigtlander photographic  lens, reground by Alvan Clark & Sons, and Dr. Draper's 11 inch  photographic lens, for which Mrs. Draper has provided a new mounting and  observatory. The 15 inch refractor belonging to the Harvard College  Observatory has also been employed in various experiments with a slit  spectroscope, and is again being used as described below. Mrs. Draper  has decided to send to Cambridge a 28 inch reflector and its mountings,  and a 15 inch mirror, which is one of the most perfect reflectors  constructed by Dr. Draper, and with which his photograph of the moon was  taken. The first two instruments mentioned above have been kept at work  during the first part of every clear night for several months. It is now  intended that at least three telescopes shall be used during the whole  night, until the work is interrupted by daylight.    The spectra have been produced by placing in front of the telescope a  large prism, thus returning to the method originally employed by  Fraunhofer in the first study of stellar spectra. Four 15 deg. prisms have  been constructed, the three largest having clear apertures of nearly  eleven inches, and the fourth being somewhat smaller. The entire weight  of these prisms exceeds a hundred pounds, and they fill a brass cubical  box a foot on each side. The spectrum of a star formed by this apparatus  is extremely narrow when the telescope is driven by clockwork in the  usual way.

Now Gunnar rode on Goti, but Hogni on Holkvi, and Gunnar smote his horse  to face the fire, but he shrank aback.    Then said Sigurd, \"Why givest thou back, Gunnar?\"    He answered, \"The horse will not tread this fire; but lend me thy horse  Grani.\"    \"Yea, with all my good will,\" says Sigurd.    Then Gunnar rides him at the fire, and yet nowise will Gram stir, nor  may Gunnar any the more ride through that fire. So now they change  semblance, Gunnar and Sigurd, even as Grimhild had taught them; then  Sigurd in the likeness of Gunnar mounts and rides, Gram in his hand, and  golden spurs on his heels; then leapt Grani into the fire when he felt  the spurs; and a mighty roar arose as the fire burned ever madder, and  the earth trembled, and the flames went up even unto the heavens, nor  had any dared to ride as he rode, even as it were through the deep mirk.    But now the fire sank withal, and he leapt from his horse and went into  the hall, even as the song says--         \"The flame flared at its maddest,       Earth's fields fell a-quaking       As the red flame aloft       Licked the lowest of heaven.       Few had been fain,       Of the rulers of folk,       To ride through that flame,       Or athwart it to tread.         \"Then Sigurd smote       Grani with sword,       And the flame was slaked       Before the king;       Low lay the flames       Before the fain of fame;       Bright gleamed the array       That Regin erst owned.    Now when Sigurd had passed through the fire, he came into a certain fair  dwelling, and therein sat Brynhild.    She asked, \"What man is it?\"    Then he named himself Gunnar, son of Giuki, and said--\"Thou art awarded  to me as my wife, by the good will and word of thy father and thy  foster-father, and I have ridden through the flames of thy fire,  according to thy word that thou hast set forth.\"    \"I wot not clearly,\" said she, \"how I shall answer thee.\"    Now Sigurd stood upright on the hall floor, and leaned on the hilt of  his sword, and he spake to Brynhild--    \"In reward thereof, shall I pay thee a great dower in gold and goodly  things?\"    She answered in heavy mood from her seat, whereas she sat like unto swan  on billow, having a sword in her hand, and a helm on her head, and being  clad in a byrny, \"O Gunnar,\" she says, \"speak not to me of such things,  unless thou be the first and best of all men; for then shalt thou slay  those my wooers, if thou hast heart thereto; I have been in battles with  the king of the Greeks, and our weapons were stained with red blood, and for  such things still I yearn.\"    He answered, \"Yea, certes many great deeds hast thou done; but yet call  thou to mind thine oath, concerning the riding through of this fire,  wherein thou didst swear that thou wouldst go with the man who should do  this deed.\"    So she found that he spoke but the sooth, and she paid heed to his  words, and arose, and greeted him meetly, and he abode there three  nights, and they lay in one bed together; but he took the sword Gram and  laid it betwixt them: then she asked him why he laid it there; and he  answered, that in that wise must he needs wed his wife or else get his  bane.    Then she took from off her the ring Andvari's-loom, which he had given  her aforetime, and gave it to him, but he gave her another ring out of  Fafnir's hoard.    Thereafter he rode away through the same fire unto his fellows, and he  and Gunnar changed semblances again, and rode unto Hlymdale, and told  how it had gone with them.    That same day went Brynhild home to her foster-father, and tells him  as one whom she trusted, how that there had come a king to her; \"And he  rode through my flaming fire, and said he was come to woo me, and named  himself Gunnar; but I said that such a deed might Sigurd alone have  done, with whom I plighted troth on the mountain; and he is my first  troth-plight, and my well-beloved.\"    Heimir said that things must needs abide even as now they had now come  to pass.    Brynhild said, \"Aslaug the daughter of me and Sigurd shall be nourished  here with thee.\"    Now the kings fare home, but Brynhild goes to her father; Grimhild  welcomes the kings meetly, and thanks Sigurd for his fellowship; and  withal is a great feast made, and many were the guests thereat; and  thither came Budli the King with his daughter Brynhild, and his son  Atli, and for many days did the feast endure: and at that feast was  Gunnar wedded to Brynhild: but when it was brought to an end, once more  has Sigurd memory of all the oaths that he sware unto Brynhild, yet  withal he let all things abide in rest and peace.    Brynhild and Gunnar sat together in great game and glee, and drank  goodly wine.        CHAPTER XXVIII. How the Queens held angry converse together at the  Bathing.    On a day as the Queens went to the river to bathe them, Brynhild waded  the farthest out into the river; then asked Gudrun what that deed might  signify.    Brynhild said, \"Yea, and why then should I be equal to thee in this  matter more than in others? I am minded to think that my father is  mightier than thine, and my true love has wrought many wondrous works of  fame, and hath ridden the flaming fire withal, while thy husband was but  the thrall of King Hjalprek.\"    Gudrun answered full of wrath, \"Thou wouldst be wise if thou shouldst  hold thy peace rather than revile my husband: lo now, the talk of all  men it is, that none has ever abode in this world like unto him in all  matters soever; and little it beseems thee of all folk to mock him who  was thy first beloved: and Fafnir he slew, yea, and he rode thy flaming  fire, whereas thou didst deem that he was Gunnar the King, and by thy  side he lay, and took from thine hand the ring Andvari's-loom;--here  mayst thou well behold it!\"    Then Brynhild saw the ring and knew it, and waxed as wan as a dead  woman, and she went home and spake no word the evening long.    So when Sigurd came to bed to Gudrun she asked him why Brynhild's joy  was so departed.    He answered, \"I know not, but sore I misdoubt me that soon we shall know  thereof overwell.\"    Gudrun said, \"Why may she not love her life, having wealth and bliss,  and the praise of all men, and the man withal that she would have?\"    \"Ah, yea!\" said Sigurd, \"and where in all the world was she then, when  she said that she deemed she had the noblest of all men, and the dearest  to her heart of all?\"    Gudrun answers, \"Tomorn will I ask her concerning this, who is the  liefest to her of all men for a husband.\"    Sigurd said, \"Needs must I forbid thee this, and full surely wilt thou  rue the deed if thou doest it.\"    Now the next morning they sat in the bower, and Brynhild was silent;  then spake Gudrun--    \"Be merry, Brynhild! Grievest thou because of that speech of ours  together, or what other thing slayeth thy bliss?\"    Brynhild answers, \"With naught but evil intent thou sayest this, for a  cruel heart thou hast.\"    \"Say not so,\" said Gudrun; \"but rather tell me all the tale.\"    Brynhild answers, \"Ask such things only as are good for thee to  know--matters meet for mighty dames. Good to love good things when all  goes according to thy heart's desire!\"    Gudrun says, \"Early days for me to glory in that; but this word of thine  looketh toward some foreseeing. What ill dost thou thrust at us? I did  naught to grieve thee.\"    Brynhild answers, \"For this shalt thou pay, in that thou hast got Sigurd  to thee,--nowise can I see thee living in the bliss thereof, whereas  thou hast him, and the wealth and the might of him.\"    But Gudrun answered, \"Naught knew I of your words and vows together; and  well might my father look to the mating of me without dealing with thee  first.\"    \"No secret speech had we,\" quoth Brynhild, \"though we swore oath  together; and full well didst thou know that thou wentest about to  beguile me; verily thou shalt have thy reward!\"    Says Gudrun, \"Thou art mated better than thou are worthy of; but thy  pride and rage shall be hard to slake belike, and therefor shall many a  man pay.\"    \"Ah, I should be well content,\" said Brynhild, \"if thou hadst not the  nobler man!\"    Gudrun answers, \"So noble a husband hast thou, that who knows of a  greater king or a lord of more wealth and might?\"    Says Brynhild, \"Sigurd slew Fafnir, and that only deed is of more worth  than all the might of King Gunnar.\"    (Even as the song says):         \"The worm Sigurd slew,       Nor e'er shall that deed       Be worsened by age       While the world is alive:       But thy brother the King       Never durst, never bore       The flame to ride down       Through the fire to fare.\"    Gudrun answers, \"Grani would not abide the fire under Gunnar the King,  but Sigurd durst the deed, and thy heart may well abide without mocking  him.\"    Brynhild answers, \"Nowise will I hide from thee that I deem no good of  Grimhild.\"    Says Gudrun, \"Nay, lay no ill words on her, for in all things she is to  thee as to her own daughter.\"    \"Ah,\" says Brynhild, \"she is the beginning of all this hale that biteth  so; an evil drink she bare to Sigurd, so that he had no more memory of  my very name.\"    \"All wrong thou talkest; a lie without measure is this,\" quoth Gudrun.    Brynhild answered, \"Have thou joy of Sigurd according to the measure of  the wiles wherewith ye have beguiled me! Unworthily have ye conspired  against me; may all things go with you as my heart hopes!\"    Gudrun says, \"More joy shall I have of him than thy wish would give unto  me: but to no man's mind it came, that he had aforetime his pleasure of  me; nay not once.\"    \"Evil speech thou speakest,\" says Brynhild; \"when thy wrath runs off  thou wilt rue it; but come now, let us no more cast angry words one at  the other!\"    Says Gudrun, \"Thou wert the first to cast such words at me,"]]]
