Such measurements can give us useful  information only when we combine them with observations made without  brass instruments, upon the total demeanor of the measured individual,  by teachers with eyes in their heads and common sense, and some feeling  for the concrete facts of human nature in their hearts.    Depend upon it, no one need be too much cast down by the discovery of  his deficiency in any elementary faculty of the mind. What tells in life  is the whole mind working together, and the deficiencies of any one  faculty can be compensated by the efforts of the rest. You can be an  artist without visual images, a reader without eyes, a mass of erudition  with a bad elementary memory. In almost any subject your passion for the  subject will save you. If you only care enough for a result, you will  almost certainly attain it. If you wish to be rich, you will be rich; if  you wish to be learned, you will be learned; if you wish to be good, you  will be good. Only you must, then, _really_ wish these things, and wish  them with exclusiveness, and not wish at the same time a hundred other  incompatible things just as strongly.    One of the most important discoveries of the 'scientific' sort that have  recently been made in psychology is that of Mr. Galton and others  concerning the great variations among individuals in the type of their  imagination. Every one is now familiar with the fact that human beings  vary enormously in the brilliancy, completeness, definiteness, and  extent of their visual images. These are singularly perfect in a large  number of individuals, and in a few are so rudimentary as hardly to  exist. The same is true of the auditory and motor images, and probably  of those of every kind; and the recent discovery of distinct brain-areas  for the various orders of sensation would seem to provide a physical  basis for such variations and discrepancies. The facts, as I said, are  nowadays so popularly known that I need only remind you of their  existence. They might seem at first sight of practical importance to the  teacher; and, indeed, teachers have been recommended to sort their  pupils in this way, and treat them as the result falls out. You should  interrogate them as to their imagery, it is said, or exhibit lists of  written words to their eyes, and then sound similar lists in their ears,  and see by which channel a child retains most words. Then, in dealing  with that child, make your appeals predominantly through that channel.  If the class were very small, results of some distinctness might  doubtless thus be obtained by a painstaking teacher. But it is obvious  that in the usual schoolroom no such differentiation of appeal is  possible; and the only really useful practical lesson that emerges from  this analytic psychology in the conduct of large schools is the lesson  already reached in a purely empirical way, that the teacher ought  always to impress the class through as many sensible channels as he can.  Talk and write and draw on blackboard, permit the pupils to talk, and  make them write and draw, exhibit pictures, plans, and curves, have your  diagrams colored differently in their different parts, etc.; and out of  the whole variety of impressions the individual child will find the most  lasting ones for himself. In all primary school work this principle of  multiple impressions is well recognized, so I need say no more about it  here.    This principle of multiplying channels and varying associations and  appeals is important, not only for teaching pupils to remember, but for  teaching them to understand. It runs, in fact, through the whole  teaching art.    One word about the unconscious and unreproducible part of our  acquisitions, and I shall have done with the topic of memory.    Professor Ebbinghaus, in a heroic little investigation into the laws of  memory which he performed a dozen or more years ago by the method of  learning lists of nonsense syllables, devised a method of measuring the  rate of our forgetfulness, which lays bare an important law of the mind.    His method was to read over his list until he could repeat it once by  heart unhesitatingly. The number of repetitions required for this was a  measure of the difficulty of the learning in each particular case. Now,  after having once learned a piece in this way, if we wait five minutes,  we find it impossible to repeat it again in the same unhesitating  manner. We must read it over again to revive some of the syllables,  which have already dropped out or got transposed. Ebbinghaus now  systematically studied the number of readings-over which were necessary  to revive the unhesitating recollection of the piece after five minutes,  half an hour, an hour, a day, a week, a month, had elapsed. The number  of rereadings required he took to be a measure of the _amount of  forgetting_ that had occurred in the elapsed interval. And he found some  remarkable facts. The process of forgetting, namely, is vastly more  rapid at first than later on. Thus full half of the piece seems to be  forgotten within the first half-hour, two-thirds of it are forgotten at  the end of eight hours, but only four-fifths at the end of a month. He  made no trials beyond one month of interval; but, if we ourselves  prolong ideally the curve of remembrance, whose beginning his  experiments thus obtain, it is natural to suppose that, no matter how  long a time might elapse, the curve would never descend quite so low as  to touch the zero-line. In other words, no matter how long ago we may  have learned a poem, and no matter how complete our inability to  reproduce it now may be, yet the first learning will still show its  lingering effects in the abridgment of the time required for learning it  again. In short, Professor Ebbinghaus's experiments show that things  which we are quite unable definitely to recall have nevertheless  impressed themselves, in some way, upon the structure of the mind. We  are different for having once learned them. The resistances in our  systems of brain-paths are altered. Our apprehensions are quickened. Our  conclusions from certain premises are probably not just what they would  be if those modifications were not there. The latter influence the whole  margin of our consciousness, even though their products, not being  distinctly reproducible, do not directly figure at the focus of the  field.    The teacher should draw a lesson from these facts. We are all too apt to  measure the gains of our pupils by their proficiency in directly  reproducing in a recitation or an examination such matters as they may  have learned, and inarticulate power in them is something of which we  always underestimate the value. The boy who tells us, \"I know the  answer, but I can't say what it is,\" we treat as practically identical  with him who knows absolutely nothing about the answer at all. But this  is a great mistake. It is but a small part of our experience in life  that we are ever able articulately to recall. And yet the whole of it  has had its influence in shaping our character and defining our  tendencies to judge and act. Although the ready memory is a great  blessing to its possessor, the vaguer memory of a subject, of having  once had to do with it, of its neighborhood, and of where we may go to  recover it again, constitutes in most men and women the chief fruit of  their education. This is true even in professional education. The  doctor, the lawyer, are seldom able to decide upon a case off-hand. They  differ from other men only through the fact that they know how to get at  the materials for decision in five minutes or half an hour: whereas the  layman is unable to get at the materials at all, not knowing in what  books and indexes to look or not understanding the technical terms.    Be patient, then, and sympathetic with the type of mind that cuts a  poor figure in examinations. It may, in the long examination which life  sets us, come out in the end in better shape than the glib and ready  reproducer, its passions being deeper, its purposes more worthy, its  combining power less commonplace, and its total mental output  consequently more important.    Such are the chief points which it has seemed worth while for me to call  to your notice under the head of memory. We can sum them up for  practical purposes by saying that the art of remembering is the art of  _thinking_; and by adding, with Dr. Pick, that, when we wish to fix a  new thing in either our own mind or a pupil's, our conscious effort  should not be so much to _impress_ and _retain_ it as to _connect_ it  with something else already there. The connecting _is_ the thinking;  and, if we attend clearly to the connection, the connected thing will  certainly be likely to remain within recall.    I shall next ask you to consider the process by which we acquire new  knowledge,--the process of 'Apperception,' as it is called, by which we  receive and deal with new experiences, and revise our stock of ideas so  as to form new or improved conceptions.          XIII. THE ACQUISITION OF IDEAS      The images of our past experiences, of whatever nature they may be,  visual or verbal, blurred and dim, vivid and distinct, abstract or  concrete, need not be memory images, in the strict sense of the word.  That is, they need not rise before the mind in a marginal fringe or  context of concomitant circumstances, which mean for us their _date_.  They may be mere conceptions, floating pictures of an object, or of its  type or class. In this undated condition, we call them products of  'imagination' or 'conception.' Imagination is the term commonly used  where the object represented is thought of as an individual thing.  Conception is the term where we think of it as a type or class.

They do not return to new forms of  embodied existence.    After having, in this way, rendered ourselves acquainted with the  contents of the Brahma-sutras according to the views of /S/a@nkara as  well as Ramanuja, we have now to consider the question which of the two  modes of interpretation represents--or at any rate more closely  approximates to the true meaning of the Sutras. That few of the Sutras  are intelligible if taken by themselves, we have already remarked above;  but this does not exclude the possibility of our deciding with a fair  degree of certainty which of the two interpretations proposed agrees  better with the text, at least in a certain number of cases.    We have to note in the first place that, in spite of very numerous  discrepancies,--of which only the more important ones have been singled  out in the conspectus of contents,--the two commentators are at one as  to the general drift of the Sutras and the arrangement of topics. As a  rule, the adhikara/n/as discuss one or several Vedic passages bearing  upon a certain point of the system, and in the vast majority of cases  the two commentators agree as to which are the special texts referred  to. And, moreover, in a very large number of cases the agreement extends  to the interpretation to be put on those passages and on the Sutras.  This far-reaching agreement certainly tends to inspire us with a certain  confidence as to the existence of an old tradition concerning the  meaning of the Sutras on which the bulk of the interpretations of  /S/a@nkara as well as of Ramanuja are based.    But at the same time we have seen that, in a not inconsiderable number  of cases, the interpretations of /S/a@nkara and Ramanuja diverge more or  less widely, and that the Sutras affected thereby are, most of them,  especially important because bearing on fundamental points of the  Vedanta system. The question then remains which of the two  interpretations is entitled to preference.    Regarding a small number of Sutras I have already (in the conspectus of  contents) given it as my opinion that Ramanuja's explanation appears to  be more worthy of consideration. We meet, in the first place, with a  number of cases in which the two commentators agree as to the literal  meaning of a Sutra, but where /S/a@nkara sees himself reduced to the  necessity of supplementing his interpretation by certain additions and  reservations of his own for which the text gives no occasion, while  Ramanuja is able to take the Sutra as it stands. To exemplify this  remark, I again direct attention to all those Sutras which in clear  terms represent the individual soul as something different from the  highest soul, and concerning which /S/a@nkara is each time obliged to  have recourse to the plea of the Sutra referring, not to what is true in  the strict sense of the word, but only to what is conventionally looked  upon as true. It is, I admit, not altogether impossible that  /S/a@nkara's interpretation should represent the real meaning of the  Sutras; that the latter, indeed, to use the terms employed by Dr.  Deussen, should for the nonce set forth an exoteric doctrine adapted to  the common notions of mankind, which, however, can be rightly understood  by him only to whose mind the esoteric doctrine is all the while  present. This is not impossible, I say; but it is a point which requires  convincing proofs before it can be allowed.--We have had, in the second  place, to note a certain number of adhikara/n/as and Sutras concerning  whose interpretation /S/a@nkara and Ramanuja disagree altogether; and we  have seen that not unfrequently the explanations given by the latter  commentator appear to be preferable because falling in more easily with  the words of the text. The most striking instance of this is afforded by  the 13th adhikara/n/a of II, 3, which treats of the size of the jiva,  and where Ramanuja's explanation seems to be decidedly superior to  /S/a@nkara's, both if we look to the arrangement of the whole  adhikara/n/a and to the wording of the single Sutras. The adhikara/n/a  is, moreover, a specially important one, because the nature of the view  held as to the size of the individual soul goes far to settle the  question what kind of Vedanta is embodied in Badaraya/n/a's work.    But it will be requisite not only to dwell on the interpretations of a  few detached Sutras, but to make the attempt at least of forming some  opinion as to the relation of the Vedanta-sutras as a whole to the chief  distinguishing doctrines of /S/a@nkara as well as Ramanuja. Such an  attempt may possibly lead to very slender positive results; but in the  present state of the enquiry even a merely negative result, viz. the  conclusion that the Sutras do not teach particular doctrines found in  them by certain commentators, will not be without its value.    The first question we wish to consider in some detail is whether the  Sutras in any way favour /S/a@nkara's doctrine that we have to  distinguish a twofold knowledge of Brahman, a higher knowledge which  leads to the immediate absorption, on death, of the individual soul in  Brahman, and a lower knowledge which raises its owner merely to an  exalted form of individual existence. The adhyaya first to be considered  in this connexion is the fourth one. According to /S/a@nkara the three  latter padas of that adhyaya are chiefly engaged in describing the fate  of him who dies in the possession of the lower knowledge, while two  sections (IV, 2, 12-14; IV, 4, 1-7) tell us what happens to him who,  before his death, had risen to the knowledge of the highest Brahman.  According to Ramanuja, on the other hand, the three padas, referring  throughout to one subject only, give an uninterrupted account of the  successive steps by which the soul of him who knows the Lord through the  Upanishads passes, at the time of death, out of the gross body which it  had tenanted, ascends to the world of Brahman, and lives there for ever  without returning into the sa/m/sara.    On an a priori view of the matter it certainly appears somewhat strange  that the concluding section of the Sutras should be almost entirely  taken up with describing the fate of him who has after all acquired an  altogether inferior knowledge only, and has remained shut out from the  true sanctuary of Vedantic knowledge, while the fate of the fully  initiated is disposed of in a few occasional Sutras. It is, I think, not  too much to say that no unbiassed student of the Sutras would--before  having allowed himself to be influenced by /S/a@nkara's  interpretations--imagine for a moment that the solemn words, 'From  thence is no return, from thence is no return,' with which the Sutras  conclude, are meant to describe, not the lasting condition of him who  has reached final release, the highest aim of man, but merely a stage on  the way of that soul which is engaged in the slow progress of gradual  release, a stage which is indeed greatly superior to any earthly form of  existence, but yet itself belongs to the essentially fictitious  sa/m/sara, and as such remains infinitely below the bliss of true mukti.  And this a priori impression--which, although no doubt significant,  could hardly be appealed to as decisive--is confirmed by a detailed  consideration of the two sets of Sutras which /S/a@nkara connects with  the knowledge of the higher Brahman. How these Sutras are interpreted by  /S/a@nkara and Ramanuja has been stated above in the conspectus of  contents; the points which render the interpretation given by Ramanuja  more probable are as follows. With regard to IV, 2, 12-14, we have to  note, in the first place, the circumstance--relevant although not  decisive in itself--that Sutra 12 does not contain any indication of a  new topic being introduced. In the second place, it can hardly be  doubted that the text of Sutra 13, 'spash/t/o hy ekesham,' is more  appropriately understood, with Ramanuja, as furnishing a reason for the  opinion advanced in the preceding Sutra, than--with /S/a@nkara--as  embodying the refutation of a previous statement (in which latter case  we should expect not 'hi' but 'tu'). And, in the third place, the 'eke,'  i.e. 'some,' referred to in Sutra 13 would, on /S/a@nkara's  interpretation, denote the very same persons to whom the preceding Sutra  had referred, viz. the followers of the Ka/n/va-/s/akha (the two Vedic  passages referred to in 12 and 13 being B/ri/. Up. IV, 4, 5, and III, 2,  11, according to the Ka/n/va recension); while it is the standing  practice of the Sutras to introduce, by means of the designation 'eke,'  members of Vedic /s/akhas, teachers, &c. other than those alluded to in  the preceding Sutras. With this practice Ramanuja's interpretation, on  the other hand, fully agrees; for, according to him, the 'eke' are the  Madhyandinas, whose reading in B/ri/. Up. IV, 4, 5, viz. 'tasmat,'  clearly indicates that the 'tasya' in the corresponding passage of the  Ka/n/vas denotes the /s/arira, i.e. the jiva. I think it is not saying  too much that /S/a@nkara's explanation, according to which the 'eke'  would denote the very same Ka/n/vas to whom the preceding Sutra had  referred--so that the Ka/n/vas would be distinguished from themselves as  it were--is altogether impossible.    The result of this closer consideration of the first set of Sutras,  alleged by /S/a@nkara to concern the owner of the higher knowledge of  Brahman, entitles us to view with some distrust /S/a@nkara's assertion  that another set also--IV, 4, 1-7--has to be detached from the general  topic of the fourth adhyaya, and to be understood as depicting the  condition of those who have obtained final absolute release. And the  Sutras themselves do not tend to weaken this preliminary want of  confidence. In the first place their"]]]
