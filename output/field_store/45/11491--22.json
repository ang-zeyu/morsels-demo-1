The  Government of India finally signified their disapproval by removing  General Hewitt from his command.    Wilson, the Brigadier, like everyone else at Meerut, appears to have  been completely taken by surprise. But why this should have been the  case, after the warning that had been given by the mutinous conduct  of the 3rd Cavalry, and why no steps should have been taken after the  exasperating parade on the 9th to guard against a possible, if not  probable, outbreak, is difficult to understand; and can only be  accounted for by that blind faith in the Native soldier, and disbelief  in his intention or ability to revolt, which led to such unfortunate  results all over India.    The following story will exemplify how completely the authorities at  Meerut were blinded by this misplaced confidence. On the afternoon of  the 9th the British officers of the 3rd Light Cavalry went to the gaol  to pay up the prisoners belonging to their regiment. When Lieutenant  Hugh Gough,[6] who was one of these officers, returned to his house,  a Hindu Native officer, belonging to the troop Gough was temporarily  commanding, told him that the men had determined to rescue their  comrades, and that the Native guard over the gaol had promised to help  them. Gough went at once to his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel  Carmichael Smyth, and reported what he had heard, but the Colonel  pooh-poohed the idea as ridiculous, and told Gough he must not give  credence to anything so monstrous.    Later in the day Gough met Brigadier Wilson and told him of the  warning which had been given to him, without, however, producing any  impression; the information was received with the same contemptuous  disbelief displayed by Colonel Carmichael Smyth.    The following day (Sunday), late in the afternoon, the same Native  officer, attended by two troopers, galloped to Gough's house, shouting  to him that the _hala_[7] had begun, and that the Native Infantry were  firing on their officers. Gough mounted his horse, and, accompanied by  the three Cavalry soldiers, proceeded as quickly as possible to the  Infantry parade-ground, where he arrived just as the wild scene of  excitement and confusion I have before described was at its height.  The sepoys, some in uniform, some in their own Native clothes, were  rushing about in the maddest disorder, yelling, shouting, and dancing  as if possessed, while the flames from the burning huts shed a lurid  light on the demoniacal proceedings.    When Gough's party appeared in sight, the sepoys called to the three  troopers to get out of the way, as they wanted to shoot the _sahib_.  No notice being taken of this warning, they fired straight at the  whole party, but without hitting anyone. Gough, seeing things had gone  too far for him to do any good, rode off with his little escort to  his own lines, where he found the men busy saddling their horses, and  helping themselves to ammunition from the regimental magazine, which  they had broken open. He endeavoured in vain to allay the excitement;  one or two shots were fired at him by recruits, but no determined  attempt was made to take his life, and at last the Native officers  combined to force him away, saying they could no longer answer for his  safety.    It was then all but dark. Gough rode off towards the European lines,  still accompanied by his trusty Native escort, and on his way came  upon an enormous crowd of people from the bazaar, armed with swords,  sticks, and anything they could get hold of, who tried to stop him.  Through these he charged, closely followed by the Native officer and  two troopers, who did not leave him until he was within sight of  the Artillery mess. Then they pulled up, and said they could go no  further. Gough did all he could to persuade them to remain with  him, but to no purpose. They told him it was impossible for them to  separate themselves from their friends and relations, and making the  officer they had so carefully protected a respectful salaam, they rode  off to join their mutinous comrades. Gough never heard of them again,  though he tried hard to trace what had become of the men who proved  themselves such 'friends in need.'    However much the authorities at Meerut deserved to be censured for  their dilatoriness in dealing with the revolt in the first instance,  and their lack of energy in not trying to discover in what direction  the mutineers had gone, I doubt whether anything would have been  gained by following them up, or whether it would have been possible  to overtake them before they reached Delhi. Only a very few European  Cavalry were available for pursuit, for the Carabineers, having lately  arrived in India, were composed mainly of recruits still in the  riding-school, and their horses for the most part were quite unbroken.  These few, with the six Horse Artillery guns, might have been  despatched; but the mutineers had a considerable start, the Cavalry  could not have been overtaken, and as soon as the Infantry became  aware that they were being followed, they would have scattered  themselves over the country, the features of which were familiar to  them, and, favoured by the darkness, could have defied pursuit. Delhi  is forty miles from Meerut, and it would not have been possible for  the 60th Rifles, marching in the terrible heat of the month of May, to  have reached that place before the next evening (the 11th), and, as  was afterwards ascertained, the work of murder and devastation there  began on the morning of that day. The three Native Infantry regiments  and the battery of Artillery stationed at Delhi were prepared to  join the insurgent troopers from Meerut directly they arrived. The  magazine, with its vast stores of war material, was in the hands of  the King, and the 150,000 inhabitants of the city were ready to assist  in the massacre of the white men and women, and the destruction of  their property.    After careful consideration of all the circumstances of the revolt at  Meerut, I have come to the conclusion that it would have been futile  to have sent the small body of mounted troops available in pursuit of  the mutineers on the night of the 10th May, and that, considering  the state of feeling throughout the Native Army, no action, however  prompt, on the part of the Meerut authorities could have arrested the  Mutiny. The sepoys had determined to throw off their allegiance to the  British Government, and the when and the how were merely questions of  time and opportunity.

The Commander-in-Chief in India at that time was General  the Hon. George Anson, an officer of forty-three years' service, but  without much Indian experience, having been only four years in the  country. He was an able, intelligent man, an excellent judge of  character, a great authority on whist and on horses, and he was well  known in London society, which was somewhat surprised when he accepted  an appointment in India--the command of the Meerut division. He did  not, however, remain long in that position, for he was soon given  the command of the Madras Army, and a year and a half later became  Commander-in-Chief in India. General Anson was present at Waterloo as  an Ensign, but had seen no service afterwards, and until he arrived in  India had held no high appointment.    When the Commander-in-Chief left Calcutta the previous autumn, all was  apparently quiet in the Native army. He visited the principal military  stations, amongst others Meerut and Delhi, and although reports of an  uneasy feeling amongst the Native troops in the Presidency division  had reached him from time to time, it was not until he arrived at  Umballa, about the middle of March, that these reports were confirmed  by personal communication with the sepoys attending the School of  Musketry which had been formed at that station.    On the occasion of the Commander-in-Chief's inspection of the School,  he learnt from the men of the various regiments under instruction how  strongly opposed they were to using a cartridge which they believed  to be injurious to their caste. Anson listened attentively to all the  sepoys had to say, and then explained to them in a manly, sensible  speech, that the old cartridge was not suited to the rifle about to be  introduced. A new cartridge had, therefore, to be made; but they must  not listen to any foolish rumour as to its being designed to destroy  their caste. He assured them, 'on the honour of a soldier like  themselves,' that it had never been, and never could be, the policy of  the British Government to coerce the religious feeling of either the  military or the civil population of India, or to interfere in any way  with their caste or customs. He told the Native officers to do all in  their power to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1653"],[0,"The Imitation of Christ (#18)"],[1,"  and ever shall be, altogether and all-perfect.  And thus it  falleth short and is insufficient whatsoever Thou givest to me  without Thyself or whatsoever Thou revealest or dost promise  concerning Thyself, whilst Thou art not seen or fully possessed:  since verily my heart cannot truly rest nor be entirely content,  except it rest in Thee, and go beyond all gifts and every  creature.    3. O my most beloved Spouse, Jesus Christ, most holy lover of my  soul, Ruler of this whole Creation, who shall give me the wings  of true liberty, that I may flee to Thee and find rest?  Oh when  shall it be given me to be open to receive Thee to the full,  and to see how sweet Thou art, O Lord my God?  When shall I  collect myself altogether in Thee, that because of Thy love I may  not feel myself at all, but may know Thee only above every sense  and measure, in measure not known to others.  But now I ofttimes  groan, and bear my sad estate with sorrow; because many evils  befall me in this vale of miseries which continually disturb and  fill me with sorrow, and encloud me, continually hinder and fill  me with care, allure and entangle me, that I cannot have free  access to Thee, nor enjoy that sweet intercourse which is always  near at hand to the blessed spirits.  Let my deep sighing come  before Thee, and my manifold desolation on the earth.    4. O Jesus, Light of Eternal Glory, solace of the wandering soul,  before Thee my mouth is without speech, and my silence speaketh  to Thee.  How long will my Lord delay to come unto me?  Let Him  come unto me, His poor and humble one, and make me glad.  Let Him  put forth His hand, and deliver His holy one from every snare.  Come, Oh come; for without Thee shall be no joyful day or hour,  for Thou art my joy, and without Thee is my table empty.  I am  miserable, and in a manner imprisoned and loaded with fetters,  until Thou refresh me by the light of Thy presence, and give me  liberty, and show Thy loving countenance.    5. Let others seek some other thing instead of Thee, whatsoever  it shall please them; but for my part nothing else pleaseth or  shall please, save Thou, my God, my hope, my eternal salvation.  I will not hold my peace, nor cease to implore, until Thy grace  return, and until Thou speak to me within.    6. \"Behold, here I am!  Behold, I come to thee, for thou didst  call Me.  Thy tears and the longing of thy soul, thy humbleness  and contrition of heart have inclined Me, and brought Me to  thee.\"    7. And I said Lord, I have called upon Thee, and I have longed to  enjoy Thee, being ready to reject everything for Thy sake.  For  Thou didst first move me to seek Thee.  Therefore, blessed be  Thou, O Lord, who has wrought this good work upon Thy servant,  according to the multitude of Thy mercy.  What then hath Thy  servant to say in Thy presence, save to humble himself greatly  before Thee, being alway mindful of his own iniquity and vileness.  For there is none like unto Thee in all marvels of heaven and  earth.  Excellent are Thy works, true are Thy judgments, and by  Thy Providence are all things governed.  Therefore praise and  glory be unto Thee, O Wisdom of the Father, let my mouth and my  soul and all created things praise and bless Thee together.      CHAPTER XXII    Of the recollection of God's manifold benefits    Open, O Lord, my heart in Thy law, and teach me to walk in the  way of Thy commandments.  Grant me to understand Thy will and to  be mindful of Thy benefits, both general and special, with great  reverence and diligent meditation, that thus I may be able  worthily to give Thee thanks.  Yet I know and confess that I  cannot render Thee due praises for the least of Thy mercies.  I  am less than the least of all the good things which Thou gavest  me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit faileth because of  the greatness thereof.    2. All things which we have in the soul and in the body, and  whatsoever things we possess, whether outwardly or inwardly,  naturally or supernaturally, are Thy good gifts, and prove Thee,  from whom we have received them all, to be good, gentle, and  kind.  Although one receiveth many things, and another fewer, yet  all are Thine, and without Thee not even the least thing can be  possessed.  He who hath received greater cannot boast that it is  of his own merit, nor lift himself up above others, nor contemn  those beneath him; for he is the greater and the better who  ascribeth least to himself, and in giving thanks is the humbler  and more devout; and he who holdeth himself to be viler than all,  and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy, is the apter for  receiving greater things.    3. But he who hath received fewer gifts, ought not to be cast  down, nor to take it amiss, nor to envy him who is richer; but  rather ought he to look unto Thee, and to greatly extol Thy  goodness, for Thou pourest forth Thy gifts so richly, so freely  and largely, without respect of persons.  All things come of  Thee; therefore in all things shalt thou be praised.  Thou  knowest what is best to be given to each; and why this man hath  less, and that more, is not for us but for Thee to understand,  for unto Thee each man's deservings are fully known.    4. Wherefore, O Lord God, I reckon it even a great benefit, not  to have many things, whence praise and glory may appear  outwardly, and after the thought of men.  For so it is that he who  considereth his own poverty and vileness, ought not only to draw  therefrom no grief or sorrow, or sadness of spirit, but rather  comfort and cheerfulness; because Thou, Lord, hast chosen the  poor and humble, and those who are poor in this world, to be Thy  friends and acquaintance.  So give all Thine apostles witness  whom Thou hast made princes in all lands.  Yet they had their  conversation in this world blameless, so humble and meek, without  any malice or deceit, that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes  for Thy Name's sake,(1) and what things the world hateth, they  embraced with great joy.    5. Therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth Thee  and knoweth Thy benefits, as Thy will in him, and the good  pleasure of Thine eternal Providence, wherewith he ought to be so  contented and comforted, that he would as willingly be the least  as any other would be the greatest, as peaceable and contented in  the lowest as in the highest place, and as willingly held of  small and low account and of no name or reputation as to be more  honourable and greater in the world than others.  For Thy will  and the love of Thine honour ought to go before all things, and  to please and comfort him more, than all benefits that are given  or may be given to himself.    (1) Acts v. 41.      CHAPTER XXIII    Of four things which bring great peace    \"My Son, now will I teach thee the way of peace and of true  liberty.\"    2. Do, O my Lord, as Thou sayest, for this is pleasing unto me to  hear.    3. \"Strive, My Son, to do another's will rather than thine own.  Choose always to have less rather than more.  Seek always after  the lowest place, and to be subject to all.  Wish always and pray  that the will of God be fulfilled in thee.  Behold, such a man as  this entereth into the inheritance of peace and quietness.\"    4. O my Lord, this Thy short discourse hath in itself much of  perfectness.  It is short in words but full of meaning, and  abundant in fruit.  For if it were possible that I should fully  keep it, disturbance would not so easily arise within me.  For as  often as I feel myself disquieted and weighed down, I find myself  to have gone back from this teaching.  But Thou, Who art  Almighty, and always lovest progress in the soul, vouchsafe more  grace, that I may be enabled to fulfil Thy exhortation, and work  out my salvation.      A PRAYER AGAINST EVIL THOUGHTS    5. O Lord my God, be not Thou far from me, my God, haste Thee to  help me,(1) for many thoughts and great fears have risen up  against me, afflicting my soul.  How shall I pass through them  unhurt? how shall I break through them?    6. \"I,\" saith He, \"will go before thee, and make the crooked  places straight.\"(2)  I will open the prison doors, and reveal to  thee the secret places.    7. Do, Lord, as Thou sayest; and let all evil thoughts fly away  before Thy face.  This is my hope and my only comfort, to fly  unto Thee in all tribulation, to hope in Thee, to call upon Thee  from my heart and patiently wait for Thy loving kindness.    A PRAYER FOR ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE MIND    8. Enlighten me, Blessed Jesus, with the brightness of Thy inner  light, and cast forth all darkness from the habitation of my  heart.  Restrain my many wandering thoughts, and carry away the  temptations which strive to do me hurt.  Fight Thou mightily for  me, and drive forth the evil beasts, so call I alluring lusts,  that peace may be within Thy walls and plenteousness of praise  within Thy palaces,(3) even in my pure conscience.  Command Thou  the winds and the storms, say unto the sea, \"Be still,\" say unto  the stormy wind, \"Hold thy peace,\" so shall there be a great  calm.    9. Oh send forth Thy light and Thy truth,(4) that they may shine  upon the earth; for I am but earth without form and void until  Thou give me light.  Pour forth Thy grace from above; water my  heart with the dew of heaven; give the waters of devotion to  water the face of the earth, and cause it to bring forth good and  perfect fruit.  Lift up my mind which is oppressed with the  weight of sins, and raise my whole desire to heavenly things;  that having tasted the sweetness of the happiness which is from  above, it may take no pleasure in thinking of things of earth.    10. Draw me and deliver me from every unstable comfort of  creatures, for no created thing is able to satisfy my desire and  to give me comfort.  Join me to Thyself by the inseparable bond  of love, for Thou alone art sufficient to him that loveth Thee,  and without Thee all things are vain toys.    (1)"]]]
