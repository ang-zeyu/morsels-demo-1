Within a few months  there were six different rebellions and six different \"rulers\".  Assassinations became the order of the day; the young heir to the throne  was removed in this way and replaced by another young prince. But as  early as 206 B.C. one of the rebels, Liu Chi (also called Liu Pang),  entered the capital and dethroned the nominal emperor. Liu Chi at first  had to retreat and was involved in hard fighting with a rival, but  gradually he succeeded in gaining the upper hand and defeated not only  his rival but also the other eighteen states that had been set up anew  in China in those years.            THE MIDDLE AGES        Chapter Six      THE HAN DYNASTY (206 B.C.-A.D. 220)    I _Development of the gentry-state_    In 206 B.C. Liu Chi assumed the title of Emperor and gave his dynasty  the name of the Han Dynasty. After his death he was given as emperor the  name of Kao Tsu.[4] The period of the Han dynasty may be described as  the beginning of the Chinese Middle Ages, while that of the Ch'in  dynasty represents the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages; for  under the Han dynasty we meet in China with a new form of state, the  \"gentry state\". The feudalism of ancient times has come definitely to  its end.    [Footnote 4: From then on, every emperor was given after his death an  official name as emperor, under which he appears in the Chinese sources.  We have adopted the original or the official name according to which of  the two has come into the more general use in Western books.]    Emperor Kao Tsu came from eastern China, and his family seems to have  been a peasant family; in any case it did not belong to the old  nobility. After his destruction of his strongest rival, the removal of  the kings who had made themselves independent in the last years of the  Ch'in dynasty was a relatively easy task for the new autocrat, although  these struggles occupied the greater part of his reign. A much more  difficult question, however, faced him: How was the empire to be  governed? Kao Tsu's old friends and fellow-countrymen, who had helped  him into power, had been rewarded by appointment as generals or high  officials. Gradually he got rid of those who had been his best comrades,  as so many upstart rulers have done before and after him in every  country in the world. An emperor does not like to be reminded of a very  humble past, and he is liable also to fear the rivalry of men who  formerly were his equals. It is evident that little attention was paid  to theories of administration; policy was determined mainly by practical  considerations. Kao Tsu allowed many laws and regulations to remain in  force, including the prohibition of Confucianist writings. On the other  hand, he reverted to the allocation of fiefs, though not to old noble  families but to his relatives and some of his closest adherents,  generally men of inferior social standing. Thus a mixed administration  came into being: part of the empire was governed by new feudal princes,  and another part split up into provinces and prefectures and placed  directly under the central power through its officials.    But whence came the officials? Kao Tsu and his supporters, as farmers  from eastern China, looked down upon the trading population to which  farmers always regard themselves as superior. The merchants were ignored  as potential officials although they had often enough held official  appointments under the former dynasty. The second group from which  officials had been drawn under the Ch'in was that of the army officers,  but their military functions had now, of course, fallen to Kao Tsu's  soldiers. The emperor had little faith, however, in the loyalty of  officers, even of his own, and apart from that he would have had first  to create a new administrative organization for them. Accordingly he  turned to another class which had come into existence, the class later  called the _gentry_, which in practice had the power already in its  hands.    The term \"gentry\" has no direct parallel in Chinese texts; the later  terms \"shen-shih\" and \"chin-shen\" do not quite cover this concept. The  basic unit of the gentry class are families, not individuals. Such  families often derive their origin from branches of the Chou nobility.  But other gentry families were of different and more recent origin in  respect to land ownership. Some late Chou and Ch'in officials of  non-noble origin had become wealthy and had acquired land; the same was  true for wealthy merchants and finally, some non-noble farmers who were  successful in one or another way, bought additional land reaching the  size of large holdings. All \"gentry\" families owned substantial estates  in the provinces which they leased to tenants on a kind of contract  basis. The tenants, therefore, cannot be called \"serfs\" although their  factual position often was not different from the position of serfs. The  rents of these tenants, usually about half the gross produce, are the  basis of the livelihood of the gentry. One part of a gentry family  normally lives in the country on a small home farm in order to be able  to collect the rents. If the family can acquire more land and if this  new land is too far away from the home farm to make collection of rents  easy, a new home farm is set up under the control of another branch of  the family. But the original home remains to be regarded as the real  family centre.    In a typical gentry family, another branch of the family is in the  capital or in a provincial administrative centre in official positions.  These officials at the same time are the most highly educated members  of the family and are often called the \"literati\". There are also always  individual family members who are not interested in official careers or  who failed in their careers and live as free \"literati\" either in the  big cities or on the home farms. It seems, to judge from much later  sources, that the families assisted their most able members to enter the  official careers, while those individuals who were less able were used  in the administration of the farms. This system in combination with the  strong familism of the Chinese, gave a double security to the gentry  families. If difficulties arose in the estates either by attacks of  bandits or by war or other catastrophes, the family members in official  positions could use their influence and power to restore the property in  the provinces. If, on the other hand, the family members in official  positions lost their positions or even their lives by displeasing the  court, the home branch could always find ways to remain untouched and  could, in a generation or two, recruit new members and regain power and  influence in the government. Thus, as families, the gentry was secure,  although failures could occur to individuals. There are many gentry  families who remained in the ruling _elite_ for many centuries, some  over more than a thousand years, weathering all vicissitudes of life.  Some authors believe that Chinese leading families generally pass  through a three- or four-generation cycle: a family member by his  official position is able to acquire much land, and his family moves  upward. He is able to give the best education and other facilities to  his sons who lead a good life. But either these sons or the grandsons  are spoiled and lazy; they begin to lose their property and status. The  family moves downward, until in the fourth or fifth generation a new  rise begins. Actual study of families seems to indicate that this is not  true. The main branch of the family retains its position over centuries.  But some of the branch families, created often by the less able family  members, show a tendency towards downward social mobility.    It is clear from the above that a gentry family should be interested in  having a fair number of children. The more sons they have, the more  positions of power the family can occupy and thus, the more secure it  will be; the more daughters they have, the more \"political\" marriages  they can conclude, i.e. marriages with sons of other gentry families in  positions of influence. Therefore, gentry families in China tend to be,  on the average, larger than ordinary families, while in our Western  countries the leading families usually were smaller than the lower class  families. This means that gentry families produced more children than  was necessary to replenish the available leading positions; thus, some  family members had to get into lower positions and had to lose status.  In view of this situation it was very difficult for lower class families  to achieve access into this gentry group. In European countries the  leading _elite_ did not quite replenish their ranks in the next  generation, so that there was always some chance for the lower classes  to move up into leading ranks. The gentry society was, therefore, a  comparably stable society with little upward social mobility but with  some downward mobility. As a whole and for reasons of gentry  self-interest, the gentry stood for stability and against change.    The gentry members in the bureaucracy collaborated closely with one  another because they were tied together by bonds of blood or marriage.  It was easy for them to find good tutors for their children, because a  pupil owed a debt of gratitude to his teacher and a child from a gentry  family could later on nicely repay this debt; often, these teachers  themselves were members of other gentry families. It was easy for sons  of the gentry to get into official positions, because the people who had  to recommend them for office were often related to them or knew the  position of their family. In Han time, local officials had the duty to  recommend young able men; if these men turned out to be good, the  officials were rewarded, if not they were blamed or even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11385"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 446, July 19, 1884 (#18)"],[1,"of bedding,  enlarged by the solvent power of atmospheric water carrying carbonic  acid, and forming crevices, galleries, or caves, are lined or filled  with ore leached from the surrounding rock, e.g., the lead deposits of  the Upper Mississippi and Missouri.    _Segregated Veins_.--Sheets of quartzose matter, chiefly lenticular and  conforming to the bedding of the inclosing rocks, but sometimes filling  irregular fractures across such bedding, found only in metamorphic  rocks, limited in extent laterally and vertically, and consisting of  material indigenous to the strata in which they occur, separated in the  process of metamorphism, e.g., quartz ledges carrying gold, copper, iron  pyrites, etc., in the Alleghany Mountains, New England, Canada, etc.    _Fissure Veins_.--Sheets of metalliferous matter filling fissures caused  by subterranean force, usually in the planes of faults, and formed by  the deposit of various minerals brought from a lower level by water,  which under pressure and at a high temperature, having great solvent  power, had become loaded with matters leached from different rocks, and  deposited them in the channels of escape as the pressure and temperature  were reduced.    Since that article was written, a considerable portion of several years  has been spent by the writer continuing the observations upon which it  was based. During this time most of the mining centers of the Western  States and Territories, as well as some in Mexico and Canada, were  visited and studied with more or less care. Perhaps no other portion of  the earth's surface is so rich in mineral resources as that which has  been covered by these observations, and nowhere else is to be found as  great a variety of ore deposits, or those which illustrate as well their  mode of formation. This is so true that it maybe said without  exaggeration that no one can intelligently discuss the questions that  have been raised in regard to the origin and mode of formation of ore  bodies without transversing and studying the great mining belt of our  Western States and Territories.    The observations made by the writer during the past four years confirm  in all essentials the views set forth in the former article in the  _Quarterly_, and while a volume might be written describing the  phenomena exhibited by different mines and mining districts, the array  of facts thus presented would be, for the most part, simply a  re-enforcement of those already given.    The present article, which must necessarily be short, would hardly have  a _raison d'etre_ except that it affords an opportunity for an addition  which should be made to the classes of mineral veins heretofore  recognized in this country, and it seems called for by the recent  publication of theories on the origin of ore deposits which are  incompatible with those hitherto presented and now held by the writer,  and which, if allowed to pass unquestioned, might seem to be  unquestionable.      BEDDED VEINS.    Certain ore deposits which have recently come under my observation  appear to correspond very closely with those that Von Cotta has taken as  types of his class of \"bedded veins,\" and as no similar ones have been  noticed by American writers on ore deposits they have seemed to me  worthy of description.    These are zones or layers of a sedimentary rock, to the bedding of which  they are conformable, impregnated with ore derived from a foreign  source, and formed long subsequent to the deposition of the containing  formation. Such deposits are exemplified by the Walker and Webster, the  Pinon, the Climax, etc., in Parley's Park, and the Green-Eyed Monster,  and the Deer Trail, at Marysvale, Utah. These are all zones in quartzite  which have been traversed by mineral solutions that have by substitution  converted such layers into ore deposits of considerable magnitude and  value.    The ore contained in these bedded veins exhibits some variety of  composition, but where unaffected by atmospheric action consists of  argentiferous galena, iron pyrites carrying gold, or the sulphides of  zinc and copper containing silver or gold or both. The ore of the Walker  and Webster and the Pinon is chiefly lead-carbonate and galena, often  stained with copper-carbonate. That of the Green Eyed Monster--now  thoroughly oxidized as far as penetrated--forms a sheet from twenty to  forty feet in thickness, consisting of ferruginous, sandy, or talcose  soft material carrying from twenty to thirty dollars to the ton in gold  and silver. The ore of the Deer Trail forms a thinner sheet containing  considerable copper, and sometimes two hundred to three hundred dollars  to the ton in silver.    The rocks which hold these ore deposits are of Silurian age, but they  received their metalliferous impregnation much later, probably in the  Tertiary, and subsequent to the period of disturbance in which they were  elevated and metamorphosed. This is proved by the fact that in places  where the rock has been shattered, strings of ore are found running off  from the main body, crossing the bedding and filling the interstices  between the fragments, forming a coarse stock-work.    Bedded veins may be distinguished from fissure veins by the absence of  all traces of a fissure, the want of a banded structure, slickensides,  selvages, etc.; from gash veins and the floors of ore which often  accompany them, as well as from segregated veins, they are distinguished  by the nature of the inclosing rock and the foreign origin of the ore.  Sometimes the plane of junction between two contiguous sheets of rock  has been the channel through which has flowed a metalliferous solution,  and the zone where the ore has replaced by substitution portions of one  or both strata. These are often called blanket veins in the West, but  they belong rather to the category of contact deposits as I have  heretofore defined them. Where such sheets of ore occupy by preference  the planes of contact between adjacent strata, but sometimes desert such  planes, and show slickensided walls, and banded structure, like the  great veins of Bingham, Utah, these should be classed as true fissure  veins.      THEORIES OF ORE DEPOSIT.    The recently published theories of the formation of mineral veins, to  which I have alluded, are those of Prof. Von Groddek[1] and Dr.  Sandberger,[2] who attribute the filling of veins to exudations of  mineral solutions from the wall rocks (i.e., lateral secretions), and  those of Mr. S.F. Emmons,[3] and Mr. G.F. Becker,[4] who have been  studying, respectively, the ore deposits of Leadville and of the  Comstock, by whom the ores are credited to the leaching of adjacent  _igneous_ rocks.    [Footnote 1: Die Lehre von den Lagerstatten der Erze, von Dr. Albrecht  von Groddek, Leipzig. 1879.]    [Footnote 2: Untersuchungen uber Erzgange, von Fridolin Sandberger,  Weisbaden, 1882.]    [Footnote 3: Geology and Mining Industry of Leadville, Annual Report,  Director U.S. Geol. Surv., 1881.]    [Footnote 4: Geology of the Comstock Lode and Washoe District, G.F.  Becker, Washington, 1883.    It is but justice to Messrs. Becker and Emmons to say that theirs are  admirable studies, thorough and exhaustive, of great interest and value  to both mining engineers and geologists, and most creditable to the  authors and the country. No better work of the kind has been done  anywhere, and it will detract little from its merit even if the views of  the authors on the theoretical question of the sources of the ores shall  not be generally adopted.]    The lack of space must forbid the full discussion of these theories at  the present time, but I will briefly enumerate some of the facts which  render it difficult for me to accept them.    First, _the great diversity of character exhibited by different sets of  fissure veins which cut the same country rock_ seems incompatible with  any theory of lateral secretion. These distinct systems are of different  ages, of diversified composition, and have evidently drawn their supply  of material from different sources. Hundreds of cases of this kind could  be cited, but I will mention only a few; among others the Humboldt, the  Bassick, and the Bull Domingo, near Rosita and Silver Cliff, Colorado.  These are veins contained in the same sheet of eruptive rock, but the  ores are as different as possible. The Humboldt is a narrow fissure  carrying a thin ore streak of high grade, consisting of sulphides of  silver, antimony, arsenic, and copper; the Bassick is a great  conglomerate vein containing tellurides of silver and gold,  argentiferous galena, blende, and yellow copper; the Bull Domingo is  also a great fissure filled with rubbish containing ore chimneys of  galena with tufts of wire silver. I may also cite the Jordan, with its  intersecting and yet distinct and totally different veins; the Galena,  the Neptune, and the American Flag, in Bingham Canon, Utah; and the  closely associated yet diverse system of veins the Ferris, the  Washington, the Chattanooga, the Fillmore, etc., in Bullion Canon at  Marysvale. In these and many other groups which have been examined by  the writer, the same rocks are cut by veins of different ages, having  different bearings, and containing different ores and veinstones. It  seems impossible that all these diversified materials should have been  derived from the same source, and the only rational explanation of the  phenomena is that which I have heretofore advocated, the ascent of  metalliferous solutions from different and deep seated sources.    Another apparently unanswerable argument against the theory of lateral  secretion is furnished by the cases _where the same vein traverses a  series of distinct formations, and holds its character essentially  unaffected by changes in the country rock_. One of many such may be  cited in the Star vein at Cherry Creek, Nevada, which, nearly at right  angles to their strike, cuts belts of quartzite, limestone,"]]]
