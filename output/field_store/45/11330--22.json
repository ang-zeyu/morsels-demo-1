But now I really  was happy, for I had learnt that man is a monstrosity.  I had been  right in feeling all things as odd, for I myself was at once worse  and better than all things.  The optimist's pleasure was prosaic,  for it dwelt on the naturalness of everything; the Christian  pleasure was poetic, for it dwelt on the unnaturalness of everything  in the light of the supernatural.  The modern philosopher had told  me again and again that I was in the right place, and I had still  felt depressed even in acquiescence.  But I had heard that I was in  the WRONG place, and my soul sang for joy, like a bird in spring.  The knowledge found out and illuminated forgotten chambers in the dark  house of infancy.  I knew now why grass had always seemed to me  as queer as the green beard of a giant, and why I could feel homesick  at home.        VI THE PARADOXES OF CHRISTIANITY           The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an  unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one.  The commonest  kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.  Life is not an illogicality; yet it is a trap for logicians.  It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is;  its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden;  its wildness lies in wait.  I give one coarse instance of what I mean.  Suppose some mathematical creature from the moon were to reckon  up the human body; he would at once see that the essential thing  about it was that it was duplicate.  A man is two men, he on the  right exactly resembling him on the left.  Having noted that there  was an arm on the right and one on the left, a leg on the right  and one on the left, he might go further and still find on each side  the same number of fingers, the same number of toes, twin eyes,  twin ears, twin nostrils, and even twin lobes of the brain.  At last he would take it as a law; and then, where he found a heart  on one side, would deduce that there was another heart on the other.  And just then, where he most felt he was right, he would be wrong.         It is this silent swerving from accuracy by an inch that is  the uncanny element in everything.  It seems a sort of secret  treason in the universe.  An apple or an orange is round enough  to get itself called round, and yet is not round after all.  The earth itself is shaped like an orange in order to lure some  simple astronomer into calling it a globe.  A blade of grass is  called after the blade of a sword, because it comes to a point;  but it doesn't. Everywhere in things there is this element of the  quiet and incalculable.  It escapes the rationalists, but it never  escapes till the last moment.  From the grand curve of our earth it  could easily be inferred that every inch of it was thus curved.  It would seem rational that as a man has a brain on both sides,  he should have a heart on both sides.  Yet scientific men are still  organizing expeditions to find the North Pole, because they are  so fond of flat country.  Scientific men are also still organizing  expeditions to find a man's heart; and when they try to find it,  they generally get on the wrong side of him.         Now, actual insight or inspiration is best tested by whether it  guesses these hidden malformations or surprises.  If our mathematician  from the moon saw the two arms and the two ears, he might deduce  the two shoulder-blades and the two halves of the brain.  But if he  guessed that the man's heart was in the right place, then I should  call him something more than a mathematician.  Now, this is exactly  the claim which I have since come to propound for Christianity.  Not merely that it deduces logical truths, but that when it suddenly  becomes illogical, it has found, so to speak, an illogical truth.  It not only goes right about things, but it goes wrong (if one  may say so) exactly where the things go wrong.  Its plan suits  the secret irregularities, and expects the unexpected.  It is simple  about the simple truth; but it is stubborn about the subtle truth.  It will admit that a man has two hands, it will not admit (though all  the Modernists wail to it) the obvious deduction that he has two hearts.  It is my only purpose in this chapter to point this out; to show  that whenever we feel there is something odd in Christian theology,  we shall generally find that there is something odd in the truth.         I have alluded to an unmeaning phrase to the effect that  such and such a creed cannot be believed in our age.  Of course,  anything can be believed in any age.  But, oddly enough, there really  is a sense in which a creed, if it is believed at all, can be  believed more fixedly in a complex society than in a simple one.  If a man finds Christianity true in Birmingham, he has actually clearer  reasons for faith than if he had found it true in Mercia.  For the more  complicated seems the coincidence, the less it can be a coincidence.  If snowflakes fell in the shape, say, of the heart of Midlothian,  it might be an accident.  But if snowflakes fell in the exact shape  of the maze at Hampton Court, I think one might call it a miracle.  It is exactly as of such a miracle that I have since come to feel  of the philosophy of Christianity.  The complication of our modern  world proves the truth of the creed more perfectly than any of  the plain problems of the ages of faith.  It was in Notting Hill  and Battersea that I began to see that Christianity was true.  This is why the faith has that elaboration of doctrines and details  which so much distresses those who admire Christianity without  believing in it.  When once one believes in a creed, one is proud  of its complexity, as scientists are proud of the complexity  of science.  It shows how rich it is in discoveries.  If it is right  at all, it is a compliment to say that it's elaborately right.  A stick might fit a hole or a stone a hollow by accident.  But a key and a lock are both complex.  And if a key fits a lock,  you know it is the right key.         But this involved accuracy of the thing makes it very difficult  to do what I now have to do, to describe this accumulation of truth.  It is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is  entirely convinced.  It is comparatively easy when he is only  partially convinced.  He is partially convinced because he has  found this or that proof of the thing, and he can expound it.  But a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he  finds that something proves it.  He is only really convinced when he  finds that everything proves it.  And the more converging reasons he  finds pointing to this conviction, the more bewildered he is if asked  suddenly to sum them up.  Thus, if one asked an ordinary intelligent man,  on the spur of the moment, \"Why do you prefer civilization to savagery?\"  he would look wildly round at object after object, and would only be  able to answer vaguely, \"Why, there is that bookcase . . . and the  coals in the coal-scuttle . . . and pianos . . . and policemen.\"  The whole case for civilization is that the case for it is complex.  It has done so many things.  But that very multiplicity of proof  which ought to make reply overwhelming makes reply impossible.         There is, therefore, about all complete conviction a kind  of huge helplessness.  The belief is so big that it takes a long  time to get it into action.  And this hesitation chiefly arises,  oddly enough, from an indifference about where one should begin.  All roads lead to Rome; which is one reason why many people never  get there.  In the case of this defence of the Christian conviction  I confess that I would as soon begin the argument with one thing  as another; I would begin it with a turnip or a taximeter cab.  But if I am to be at all careful about making my meaning clear,  it will, I think, be wiser to continue the current arguments  of the last chapter, which was concerned to urge the first of  these mystical coincidences, or rather ratifications.  All I had  hitherto heard of Christian theology had alienated me from it.  I was a pagan at the age of twelve, and a complete agnostic by the  age of sixteen; and I cannot understand any one passing the age  of seventeen without having asked himself so simple a question.  I did, indeed, retain a cloudy reverence for a cosmic deity  and a great historical interest in the Founder of Christianity.  But I certainly regarded Him as a man; though perhaps I thought that,  even in that point, He had an advantage over some of His modern critics.  I read the scientific and sceptical literature of my time--all of it,  at least, that I could find written in English and lying about;  and I read nothing else; I mean I read nothing else on any other  note of philosophy.  The penny dreadfuls which I also read  were indeed in a healthy and heroic tradition of Christianity;  but I did not know this at the time.  I never read a line of  Christian apologetics.  I read as little as I can of them now.  It was Huxley and Herbert Spencer and Bradlaugh who brought me  back to orthodox theology.  They sowed in my mind my first wild  doubts of doubt.  Our grandmothers were quite right when they said  that Tom Paine and the free-thinkers unsettled the mind.  They do.  They unsettled mine horribly.  The rationalist made me question  whether reason was of any use whatever; and when I had finished  Herbert Spencer I had got as far as doubting (for the first time)  whether evolution had occurred at all.  As I laid down the last of  Colonel Ingersoll's atheistic lectures the dreadful thought broke  across my mind, \"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\"  I was  in a desperate way.         This odd effect of the great agnostics in arousing doubts  deeper than their own might be illustrated in many ways.  I take only one.  As I read and re-read all the non-Christian  or anti-Chr"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1300"],[0,"Riders of the Purple Sage (#18)"],[1," on the bulge of rising stone, he killed the animal and slung it from his  belt.    Before starting down he waited to catch his breath. He had climbed  far up that wonderful smooth slope, and had almost reached the base  of yellow cliff that rose skyward, a huge scarred and cracked bulk. It  frowned down upon him as if to forbid further ascent. Venters bent over  for his rifle, and, as he picked it up from where it leaned against the  steeper grade, he saw several little nicks cut in the solid stone.    They were only a few inches deep and about a foot apart. Venters began  to count them--one--two--three--four--on up to sixteen. That number  carried his glance to the top of his first bulging bench of cliff-base.  Above, after a more level offset, was still steeper slope, and the line  of nicks kept on, to wind round a projecting corner of wall.    A casual glance would have passed by these little dents; if Venters had  not known what they signified he would never have bestowed upon them the  second glance. But he knew they had been cut there by hand, and,  though age-worn, he recognized them as steps cut in the rock by the  cliff-dwellers. With a pulse beginning to beat and hammer away his  calmness, he eyed that indistinct line of steps, up to where the  buttress of wall hid further sight of them. He knew that behind  the corner of stone would be a cave or a crack which could never be  suspected from below. Chance, that had sported with him of late, now  directed him to a probable hiding-place. Again he laid aside his rifle,  and, removing boots and belt, he began to walk up the steps. Like a  mountain goat, he was agile, sure-footed, and he mounted the first bench  without bending to use his hands. The next ascent took grip of fingers  as well as toes, but he climbed steadily, swiftly, to reach the  projecting corner, and slipped around it. Here he faced a notch in the  cliff. At the apex he turned abruptly into a ragged vent that split the  ponderous wall clear to the top, showing a narrow streak of blue sky.    At the base this vent was dark, cool, and smelled of dry, musty dust.  It zigzagged so that he could not see ahead more than a few yards at a  time. He noticed tracks of wildcats and rabbits in the dusty floor. At  every turn he expected to come upon a huge cavern full of little square  stone houses, each with a small aperture like a staring dark eye. The  passage lightened and widened, and opened at the foot of a narrow,  steep, ascending chute.    Venters had a moment's notice of the rock, which was of the same  smoothness and hardness as the slope below, before his gaze went  irresistibly upward to the precipitous walls of this wide ladder of  granite. These were ruined walls of yellow sandstone, and so split and  splintered, so overhanging with great sections of balancing rim, so  impending with tremendous crumbling crags, that Venters caught his  breath sharply, and, appalled, he instinctively recoiled as if a step  upward might jar the ponderous cliffs from their foundation. Indeed, it  seemed that these ruined cliffs were but awaiting a breath of wind  to collapse and come tumbling down. Venters hesitated. It would be a  foolhardy man who risked his life under the leaning, waiting avalanches  of rock in that gigantic split. Yet how many years had they leaned there  without falling! At the bottom of the incline was an immense heap of  weathered sandstone all crumbling to dust, but there were no huge rocks  as large as houses, such as rested so lightly and frightfully above,  waiting patiently and inevitably to crash down. Slowly split from the  parent rock by the weathering process, and carved and sculptured by ages  of wind and rain, they waited their moment. Venters felt how foolish  it was for him to fear these broken walls; to fear that, after they had  endured for thousands of years, the moment of his passing should be the  one for them to slip. Yet he feared it.    \"What a place to hide!\" muttered Venters. \"I'll climb--I'll see where  this thing goes. If only I can find water!\"    With teeth tight shut he essayed the incline. And as he climbed he bent  his eyes downward. This, however, after a little grew impossible; he had  to look to obey his eager, curious mind. He raised his glance and saw  light between row on row of shafts and pinnacles and crags that stood  out from the main wall. Some leaned against the cliff, others against  each other; many stood sheer and alone; all were crumbling, cracked,  rotten. It was a place of yellow, ragged ruin. The passage narrowed as  he went up; it became a slant, hard for him to stick on; it was smooth  as marble. Finally he surmounted it, surprised to find the walls still  several hundred feet high, and a narrow gorge leading down on the other  side. This was a divide between two inclines, about twenty yards wide.  At one side stood an enormous rock. Venters gave it a second glance,  because it rested on a pedestal. It attracted closer attention. It was  like a colossal pear of stone standing on its stem. Around the bottom  were thousands of little nicks just distinguishable to the eye. They  were marks of stone hatchets. The cliff-dwellers had chipped and chipped  away at this boulder till it rested its tremendous bulk upon a mere  pin-point of its surface. Venters pondered. Why had the little stone-men  hacked away at that big boulder? It bore no semblance to a statue or an  idol or a godhead or a sphinx. Instinctively he put his hands on it  and pushed; then his shoulder and heaved. The stone seemed to groan, to  stir, to grate, and then to move. It tipped a little downward and hung  balancing for a long instant, slowly returned, rocked slightly, groaned,  and settled back to its former position.    Venters divined its significance. It had been meant for defense. The  cliff-dwellers, driven by dreaded enemies to this last stand, had  cunningly cut the rock until it balanced perfectly, ready to be  dislodged by strong hands. Just below it leaned a tottering crag that  would have toppled, starting an avalanche on an acclivity where no  sliding mass could stop. Crags and pinnacles, splintered cliffs, and  leaning shafts and monuments, would have thundered down to block forever  the outlet to Deception Pass.    \"That was a narrow shave for me,\" said Venters, soberly. \"A balancing  rock! The cliff-dwellers never had to roll it. They died, vanished,  and here the rock stands, probably little changed.... But it might serve  another lonely dweller of the cliffs. I'll hide up here somewhere, if I  can only find water.\"    He descended the gorge on the other side. The slope was gradual, the  space narrow, the course straight for many rods. A gloom hung between  the up-sweeping walls. In a turn the passage narrowed to scarce a dozen  feet, and here was darkness of night. But light shone ahead; another  abrupt turn brought day again, and then wide open space.    Above Venters loomed a wonderful arch of stone bridging the canyon rims,  and through the enormous round portal gleamed and glistened a beautiful  valley shining under sunset gold reflected by surrounding cliffs. He  gave a start of surprise. The valley was a cove a mile long, half  that wide, and its enclosing walls were smooth and stained, and curved  inward, forming great caves. He decided that its floor was far higher  than the level of Deception Pass and the intersecting canyons. No purple  sage colored this valley floor. Instead there were the white of aspens,  streaks of branch and slender trunk glistening from the green of leaves,  and the darker green of oaks, and through the middle of this forest,  from wall to wall, ran a winding line of brilliant green which marked  the course of cottonwoods and willows.    \"There's water here--and this is the place for me,\" said Venters. \"Only  birds can peep over those walls, I've gone Oldring one better.\"    Venters waited no longer, and turned swiftly to retrace his steps. He  named the canyon Surprise Valley and the huge boulder that guarded the  outlet Balancing Rock. Going down he did not find himself attended by  such fears as had beset him in the climb; still, he was not easy in  mind and could not occupy himself with plans of moving the girl and his  outfit until he had descended to the notch. There he rested a moment and  looked about him. The pass was darkening with the approach of night. At  the corner of the wall, where the stone steps turned, he saw a spur of  rock that would serve to hold the noose of a lasso. He needed no more  aid to scale that place. As he intended to make the move under cover  of darkness, he wanted most to be able to tell where to climb up. So,  taking several small stones with him, he stepped and slid down to the  edge of the slope where he had left his rifle and boots. He placed the  stones some yards apart. He left the rabbit lying upon the bench where  the steps began. Then he addressed a keen-sighted, remembering gaze to  the rim-wall above. It was serrated, and between two spears of rock,  directly in line with his position, showed a zigzag crack that at night  would let through the gleam of sky. This settled, he put on his belt  and boots and prepared to descend. Some consideration was necessary to  decide whether or not to leave his rifle there. On the return, carrying  the girl and a pack, it would be added encumbrance; and after debating  the matter he left the rifle leaning against the bench. As he went  straight down the slope he halted every few rods to look up at his mark  on the rim. It changed, but he fixed each change in his memory. When he  reached the first cedar-tree, he tied his scarf upon a dead branch, and  then hurried toward camp, having no more concern about finding his trail  upon the return trip.    Darkness soon emboldened and lent him greater speed. It occurred to him,  as he glided into the grassy glade near camp and head the whinny of a  horse, that he had forgotten Wrangle. The"]]]
