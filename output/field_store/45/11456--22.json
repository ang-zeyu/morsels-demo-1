The couches, to which this table was the centre, were covered  with tapestries of azure and gold; and from invisible tubes the vaulted  roof descended showers of fragrant waters, that cooled the delicious  air, and contended with the lamps, as if the spirits of wave and fire  disputed which element could furnish forth the most delicious odorous.  And now, from behind the snowy draperies, trooped such forms as Adonis  beheld when he lay on the lap of Venus.  They came, some with garlands,  others with lyres; they surrounded the youth, they led his steps to the  banquet.  They flung the chaplets round him in rosy chains.  The  earth--the thought of earth, vanished from his soul.  He imagined  himself in a dream, and suppressed his breath lest he should wake too  soon; the senses, to which he had never yielded as yet, beat in his  burning pulse, and confused his dizzy and reeling sight.  And while thus  amazed and lost, once again, but in brisk and Bacchic measures, rose the  magic strain:                    ANACREONTIC           In the veins of the calix foams and glows            The blood of the mantling vine,          But oh! in the bowl of Youth there glows            A Lesbian, more divine!                Bright, bright,               As the liquid light,           Its waves through thine eyelids shine!           Fill up, fill up, to the sparkling brim,            The juice of the young Lyaeus;          The grape is the key that we owe to him            From the gaol of the world to free us.                Drink, drink!               What need to shrink,           When the lambs alone can see us?           Drink, drink, as I quaff from thine eyes            The wine of a softer tree;          Give the smiles to the god of the grape--thy sighs,            Beloved one, give to me.                Turn, turn,               My glances burn,           And thirst for a look from thee!  As the song ended, a group of three maidens, entwined with a chain of  starred flowers, and who, while they imitated, might have shamed the  Graces, advanced towards him in the gliding measures of the Ionian  dance: such as the Nereids wreathed in moonlight on the yellow sands of  the AEgean wave--such as Cytherea taught her handmaids in the  marriage-feast of Psyche and her son.    Now approaching, they wreathed their chaplet round his head; now  kneeling, the youngest of the three proffered him the bowl, from which  the wine of Lesbos foamed and sparkled.  The youth resisted no more, he  grasped the intoxicating cup, the blood mantled fiercely through his  veins.  He sank upon the breast of the nymph who sat beside him, and  turning with swimming eyes to seek for Arbaces, whom he had lost in the  whirl of his emotions, he beheld him seated beneath a canopy at the  upper end of the table, and gazing upon him with a smile that encouraged  him to pleasure.  He beheld him, but not as he had hitherto seen, with  dark and sable garments, with a brooding and solemn brow: a robe that  dazzled the sight, so studded was its whitest surface with gold and  gems, blazed upon his majestic form; white roses, alternated with the  emerald and the ruby, and shaped tiara-like, crowned his raven locks.  He appeared, like Ulysses, to have gained the glory of a second  youth--his features seemed to have exchanged thought for beauty, and he  towered amidst the loveliness that surrounded him, in all the beaming  and relaxing benignity of the Olympian god.    'Drink, feast, love, my pupil!' said he, 'blush not that thou art  passionate and young.  That which thou art, thou feelest in thy veins:  that which thou shalt be, survey!'    With this he pointed to a recess, and the eyes of Apaecides, following  the gesture, beheld on a pedestal, placed between the statues of Bacchus  and Idalia, the form of a skeleton.    'Start not,' resumed the Egyptian; 'that friendly guest admonishes us  but of the shortness of life.  From its jaws I hear a voice that summons  us to ENJOY.'    As he spoke, a group of nymphs surrounded the statue; they laid chaplets  on its pedestal, and, while the cups were emptied and refilled at that  glowing board, they sang the following strain:             BACCHIC HYMNS TO THE IMAGE OF DEATH                        I            Thou art in the land of the shadowy Host,             Thou that didst drink and love:           By the Solemn River, a gliding ghost,             But thy thought is ours above!                  If memory yet can fly,                  Back to the golden sky,             And mourn the pleasures lost!           By the ruin'd hall these flowers we lay,             Where thy soul once held its palace;           When the rose to thy scent and sight was gay,             And the smile was in the chalice,                  And the cithara's voice                  Could bid thy heart rejoice             When night eclipsed the day.    Here a new group advancing, turned the tide of the music into a quicker  and more joyous strain.                          II            Death, death is the gloomy shore             Where we all sail--          Soft, soft, thou gliding oar;             Blow soft, sweet gale!           Chain with bright wreaths the Hours;             Victims if all           Ever, 'mid song and flowers,             Victims should fall!    Pausing for a moment, yet quicker and quicker danced the silver-footed  music:              Since Life's so short, we'll live to laugh,             Ah! wherefore waste a minute!           If youth's the cup we yet can quaff,             Be love the pearl within it!    A third band now approached with brimming cups, which they poured in  libation upon that strange altar; and once more, slow and solemn, rose  the changeful melody:                      III            Thou art welcome, Guest of gloom,             From the far and fearful sea!           When the last rose sheds its bloom,             Our board shall be spread with thee!                All hail, dark Guest!             Who hath so fair a plea             Our welcome Guest to be,             As thou, whose solemn hall             At last shall feast us all             In the dim and dismal coast?             Long yet be we the Host!             And thou, Dead Shadow, thou,             All joyless though thy brow,                 Thou--but our passing GUEST!      At this moment, she who sat beside Apaecides suddenly took up the song:                          IV            Happy is yet our doom,             The earth and the sun are ours!           And far from the dreary tomb             Speed the wings of the rosy Hours--            Sweet is for thee the bowl,                Sweet are thy looks, my love;             I fly to thy tender soul,                As bird to its mated dove!                  Take me, ah, take!             Clasp'd to thy guardian breast,             Soft let me sink to rest:                  But wake me--ah, wake!             And tell me with words and sighs,             But more with thy melting eyes,                  That my sun is not set--           That the Torch is not quench'd at the Urn             That we love, and we breathe, and burn,                  Tell me--thou lov'st me yet!            BOOK THE SECOND        Chapter I    A FLASH HOUSE IN POMPEII, AND THE GENTLEMEN OF THE CLASSIC RING.    TO one of those parts of Pompeii, which were tenanted not by the lords  of pleasure, but by its minions and its victims; the haunt of gladiators  and prize-fighters; of the vicious and the penniless; of the savage and  the obscene; the Alsatia of an ancient city--we are now transported.    It was a large room, that opened at once on the confined and crowded  lane. Before the threshold was a group of men, whose iron and  well-strung muscles, whose short and Herculean necks, whose hardy and  reckless countenances, indicated the champions of the arena. On a shelf,  without the shop, were ranged jars of wine and oil; and right over this  was inserted in the wall a coarse painting, which exhibited gladiators  drinking--so ancient and so venerable is the custom of signs!  Within  the room were placed several small tables, arranged somewhat in the  modern fashion of 'boxes', and round these were seated several knots of  men, some drinking, some playing at dice, some at that more skilful game  called 'duodecim scriptae', which certain of the blundering learned have  mistaken for chess, though it rather, perhaps, resembled backgammon of  the two, and was usually, though not always, played by the assistance of  dice.  The hour was in the early forenoon, and nothing better, perhaps,  than that unseasonable time itself denoted the habitual indolence of  these tavern loungers.    Yet, despite the situation of the house and the character of its  inmates, it indicated none of that sordid squalor which would have  characterized a similar haunt in a modern city.  The gay disposition of  all the Pompeians, who sought, at least, to gratify the sense even where  they neglected the mind, was typified by the gaudy colors which  decorated the walls, and the shapes, fantastic but not inelegant, in  which the lamps, the drinking-cups, the commonest household utensils,  were wrought.    'By Pollux!' said one of the gladiators, as he leaned against the wall  of the threshold, 'the wine thou sellest us, old Silenus'--and as he  spoke he slapped a portly personage on the back--'is enough to thin the  best blood in one's veins.'    The man thus caressingly saluted, and whose bared arms, white apron, and  keys and napkin tucked carelessly within his girdle, indicated him to be  the host of the tavern, was already passed into the autumn of his years;  but his form was still so robust and athletic, that he might have shamed  even the sinewy shapes beside him, save that the muscles had seeded, as  it were, into flesh, that the cheeks were swelled and bloated, and the  increasing stomach threw into shade the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15663"],[0,"Ancient Egypt (#18)"],[1,"  great river; but it is probably as convenient a point as can be found  between Assouan (Syene) and Khartoum. The conquest was regarded as  redounding greatly to Usurtasen's glory, and made him the hero of the  Old Empire. Myths gathered about his name, which, softened into  Sesostris, became a favourite One in the mouths of Egyptian minstrels  and minnesingers. Usurtasen grew to be a giant more than seven feet  high, who conquered, not only all Ethiopia, but also Europe and Asia;  his columns were said to be found in Palestine, Asia Minor, Scythia, and  Thrace; he left a colony at Colchis, the city of the golden fleece; he  dug all the canals by which Egypt was intersected; he invented geometry;  he set up colossi above fifty feet high; he was the greatest monarch  that had ruled Egypt since the days of Osiris!    No doubt these tales were, in the main, imaginary; but they marked the  fact that in Usurtasen III. the military glories of the Old Empire  culminated.        FOOTNOTES:    [9] So Mr. A.D. Bartlett, F.Z.S., in the \"Transactions of the Society of  Biblical Archaeology,\" vol. iv. p. 195.    [10] R. Stuart Poole, \"Cities of Egypt,\" p. 52.          VI.    THE GOOD AMENEMHAT AND HIS WORKS.      The great river to which Egypt owes her being, is at once the source of  all her blessings and her chiefest danger. Swelling with a uniformity,  well calculated to call forth man's gratitude and admiration, almost  from a fixed day in each year, and continuing to rise steadily for  months, it gradually spreads over the lands, covering the entire soil  with a fresh coating of the richest possible alluvium, and thus securing  to the country a perpetual and inexhaustible fertility. Nature's  mechanism is so perfect, that the rise year after year scarcely varies a  foot, and is almost exactly the same now as it was when the first  Pharaoh poured his libation to the river-god from the embankment which  he had made at Memphis; but though this uniformity is great, and  remarkable, and astonishing, it is not absolute. There are occasions,  once in two or three centuries, when the rainfall in Abyssinia is  excessive. The Blue Nile and the Atbara pour into the deep and steady  stream of the White Nile torrents of turbid water for months together.  The windows of heaven seem to have been opened, and the rain pours down  as if it would never cease. Then the river of the Egyptians assumes a  threatening character; faster and faster it rises, and higher and  higher; and further and further it spreads, until it begins to creep up  the sides of the two ranges of hills. Calamitous results ensue. The  mounds erected to protect the cities, the villages, and the pasture  lands, are surmounted, or undermined, or washed away; the houses, built  often of mud, and seldom of any better material than crude brick,  collapse; cattle are drowned by hundreds; human life is itself  imperilled; the population has to betake itself to boats, and to fly to  the desert regions which enclose the Nile valley to the east and west,  regions of frightful sterility, which with difficulty support the few  wandering tribes that are their normal inhabitants. If the excessive  rise continues long, thousands or millions starve; if it passes off  rapidly, then the inhabitants return to find their homes desolated,  their cattle drowned, their household goods washed away, and themselves  dependent on the few rich men who may have stored their corn in stone  granaries which the waters have not been able to penetrate. Disasters of  this kind are, however, exceedingly rare, though, when they occur, their  results are terrible to contemplate.    The more usual form of calamity is of the opposite kind. Once or twice  in a century the Abyssinian rainfall is deficient. The rise of the Nile  is deferred beyond the proper date. Anxious eyes gaze daily on the  sluggish stream, or consult the \"Nilometers\" which kings and princes  have constructed along its course to measure the increase of the waters.  Hopes and fears alternate as good or bad news reaches the inhabitants of  the lower valley from those who dwell higher up the stream. Each little  rise is expected to herald a greater one, and the agony of suspense is  prolonged until the \"hundred days,\" traditionally assigned to the  increase, have gone by, and there is no longer a doubt that the river  has begun to fall. Then hope is swallowed up in despair. Only the lands  lying nearest to the river have been inundated; those at a greater  distance from it lie parched and arid during the entire summer-time, and  fail to produce a single blade of grass or spike of corn. Famine stares  the poorer classes in the face, and unless large supplies of grain have  been laid up in store previously, or can be readily imported from  abroad, the actual starvation of large numbers is the inevitable  consequence. We have heartrending accounts of such famines. In the year  457 of the Hegira (A.D. 1064) a famine began, which lasted seven years,  and was so severe that dogs and cats, and even human flesh, were eaten;  all the horses of the Caliph but three perished, and his family had to  fly into Syria. Another famine in A.D. 1199 is recorded by Abd-el-Latif,  an eye-witness, in very similar terms.    There is reason to believe that, under the twelfth dynasty, some  derangement of meteoric or atmospheric conditions passed over Abyssinia  and Upper Egypt, either in both the directions above noticed, or, at any  rate, in the latter and more ordinary one. An official belonging to the  later part of this period, in enumerating his merits upon his tomb,  tells us, \"There was no poverty in my days, no starvation in my time,  even when there were years of famine. I ploughed all the fields of Mah  to its southern and northern boundaries; I gave life to its  inhabitants, making its food; no one was starved in it. I gave to the  widow as to the married woman.\" As the late Dr. Birch observes, \"Egypt  was occasionally subject to famines; and these, at the time of the  twelfth dynasty, were so important, that they attracted great attention,  and were considered worthy of record by the princes or hereditary lords  who were buried at Beni-Hassan. Under the twelfth dynasty, also, the  tombs of Abydos show the creation of superintendents, or storekeepers of  the public granaries, a class of functionaries apparently created to  meet the contingency.\"[11]    The distress of his subjects under these circumstances seems to have  drawn the thoughts of \"the good Amenemhat\" to the devising of some  system which should effectually remedy these evils, by preventing their  occurrence. In all countries where the supply of water is liable to be  deficient, it is of the utmost importance to utilize to the full that  amount of the life-giving fluid, be it more or be it less, which the  bounty of nature furnishes. Rarely, indeed, is nature absolutely a  niggard. Mostly she gives far more than is needed, but the improvidence  or the apathy of man allows her gifts to run to waste. Careful and  provident husbanding of her store will generally make it suffice for all  man's needs and requirements. Sometimes this has been effected in a  thirsty land by conducting all the rills and brooks that flow from the  highlands or hills into subterranean conduits, where they are shielded  from the sun's rays, and prolonging these ducts for miles upon miles,  till every drop of the precious fluid has been utilized for irrigation.  Such is the _kareez_ or _kanat_ system of Persia. In other places vast  efforts have been made to detain the abundant supply of rain which  nature commonly provides in the spring of the year, to store it, and  prevent it from flowing off down the river-courses to the sea, where it  is absolutely lost. For this purpose, either huge reservoirs must be  constructed by the hand of man, or else advantage must be taken of some  facility which nature offers for storing the water in convenient  situations. Valleys may be blocked by massive dams, and millions of  gallons thus imprisoned for future use, as is done in many parts of the  North of England, but for manufacturing and not for irrigation purposes.  Or naturally land-locked basins may be found, and the overflow of  streams at their flood-time turned into them and arrested, to be made  use of later in the year.    In Egypt the one and only valley was that of the Nile, and the one and  only stream that which had formed it, and flowed along it, at a lower or  higher level, ceaselessly. It might perhaps have been possible for  Egyptian engineering skill to have blocked the valley at Silsilis, or at  the Gebelein, and to have thus turned Upper Egypt into a huge reservoir  always full, and always capable of supplying Lower Egypt with enough  water to eke out a deficient inundation. But this could only have been  done by an enormous work, very difficult to construct, and at the  sacrifice of several hundred square miles of fertile territory, thickly  inhabited, which would have been covered permanently by the artificial  lake. Moreover, the Egyptians would have known that such an embankment  can under no circumstances be absolutely secure, and may have foreseen  that its rupture would spread destruction over the whole of the lower  country. Amenemhat, at any rate, did not venture to adopt so bold a  design. He sought for a natural depression, and found one in the Libyan  range of hills to the west of the Nile valley, about a degree south of  the latitude of Memphis--a depression of great depth and of ample  expanse, fifty miles or more in length by thirty in breadth, and  containing an area of six or seven hundred square miles. It was  separated from the Nile valley by a narrow ridge of hills about two  hundred feet high, through which ran from south-east to north-west a  narrow rocky gorge, giving access to the depression. It is possible that  in very high floods some of the water of the inundation passed naturally "]]]
