His first appearance  as an architect was his acceptance of the post of Surveyor of King  Charles II.'s public works. This was in 1661. He lost no time in  starting in his new profession, for in 1663 he designed the chapel of  Pembroke College, Cambridge, which his uncle Matthew gave, and the  Sheldonian Theatre at Oxford. This, then, brings him down to the  survey of St. Paul's above named. It was carefully made, and presented  in May, 1666. How he designed to rebuild some portions which were  decayed, to introduce more light, to cut off the corners of the cross  and erect a central dome--all this boots not now to tell. The plans  were drawn, and estimates were ordered on Monday, August 27th, 1666.    But before another week had passed an effectual end was put for many a  day to all plans for the \"repair of the cathedral.\" Pepys begins his  diary of September 2nd with the following words:--\"Lord's Day.--Some  of our maids sitting up late last night to get things ready against  our feast to-day, Jane calls us up about three in the morning to tell  us of a great fire they saw in the City; so I rose and slipped on my  night-gown and went to her window, and thought it to be on the back  of Mark Lane at the farthest.\" He thought this was far enough off and  went to bed again. But next day he realises that it is all a terrible  business, and so he goes on to tell how he walked about the streets  and in some places burned his shoes; went on the river, where the  hot fiery flakes pursued him; went to the King and gave advice and  received instructions; met the Lord Mayor who seemed out of his  senses. So he goes on with his well-known description until September  7th, when he was \"Up by five o'clock, and blessed be God! find all  well, and by water to Paul's Wharf. Walked thence and saw all the town  burned, and a miserable sight of Paul's Church, with all the roof  fallen, and the body of the choir fallen into St. Faith's; Paul's  School also, Ludgate, and Fleet Street.\"    Evelyn's note of the disaster is written in a higher key. \"September  3rd ... I went and saw the whole south part of the City burning from  Cheapeside to the Thames, and all along Cornehill (for it likewise  kindl'd back against the wind as well as forward), Tower Streete,  Fen-church Streete, Gracious Streete, and so along to Bainard's  Castle, and was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the  scaffolds contributed exceedingly. The conflagration was so universal,  and the people so astonish'd, that from the beginning, I know not by  what despondency or fate, they hardly stirr'd to quench it, so that  there was nothing heard or seene but crying out and lamentation,  running about like distracted creatures, without at all attempting to  save even their goods--such a strange consternation there was upon  them, so as it burned both in breadth and length, the churches, public  halls, Exchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments, leaping after  a prodigious manner from house to house and streete to streete, at  greate distances one from the other; for the heate, with a long set of  faire and warme weather, had even ignited the aire and prepar'd the  materials to conceive the fire, which devoured after an incredible  manner, houses, furniture, and everything. Here we saw the Thames  cover'd with goods floating, all the barges and boates laden with what  some had time and courage to save, as, on the other, the carts, &c.,  carrying out to the fields, which for many miles were strew'd with  moveables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both people  and what goods they could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous  spectacle, such as haply the world had not seene the like since the  foundation of it, nor be outdone till the universal conflagration of  it. All the skie was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning  oven, and the light seene above forty miles round about for many  nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like, who now saw  above 10,000 houses all in one flame; the noise and crackling and  thunder of the impetuous flames, the shreiking (sic) of women and  children, the hurry of people, the fall of Towers, Houses, and  Churches, was like an hideous storme, and the aire all about so hot  and inflam'd that, at the last, one was not able to approach it, so  that they were forc'd to stand still and let the flames burn on, which  they did for neere two miles in length and one in bredth. The clowds  also of smoke were dismall, and reach'd, upon computation, neer  fifty-six miles in length. Thus I left it this afternoone burning, a  resemblance of Sodom or the last day. It forcibly call'd to my mind  that passage--_non enim hic habemus stabilem civitatem:_ the ruines  resembling the picture of Troy--London was, but is no more! Thus I  returned home.    \"September 7th.--I went this morning on foote from White-hall as far  as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by  St. Paules, Cheapeside, Exchange, Bishopsgate, Aldersgate, and on  to Moorefields, thence thro' Cornehill, &c., with extraordinary  difficulty, clambering over heaps of yet smoking rubbish, and  frequently mistaking where I was....    \"At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church  St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautifull portico (for structure  comparable to any in Europe, as not long before repair'd by the late  King) now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and  nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave,  shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd.  It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in  a manner calcin'd, so that all the ornaments, columns, freezes,  capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to  the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less  than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the  vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with  the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried  thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke  following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the  East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of  one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable  Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian  world.\"    Sancroft, who was Dean at the time of the fire, and who afterwards  became Archbishop, was anxious to restore the cathedral on the old  lines. Henchman was Bishop, but he left the matter for the Dean to  deal with, though he not only rebuilt the Bishop's Palace at his own  expense but contributed munificently to the new building. Sancroft  preached within the ruined building before the King on October 10th,  1667, from the text, \"His compassions fail not,\" and the sermon is  really eloquent. The congregation was gathered at the west end, which  had been hastily fitted up. The east end was absolute ruin.    Wren had already declared that it was impossible to restore the old  building, and in the following April, Sancroft wrote to him that he  had been right in so judging. \"Our work at the west end,\" he wrote,  \"has fallen about our ears.\" Two pillars had come down with a crash,  and the rest was so unsafe that men were afraid to go near, even to  pull it down. He added, \"You are so absolutely necessary to us that  we can do nothing, resolve on nothing without you.\" This settled the  question.    There is a little difficulty with regard to the drawing, preserved  in the library of the cathedral, of the West Front after the Fire.  Evelyn, as we have seen, seems to describe it as far more ruinous than  the picture before us shows. Perhaps the artist filled up some of the  details from his memory, for the drawing hardly looks so desolate a  ruin as Evelyn implies. The gable of the nave roof is striking  enough, and evidently exactly according to fact; and the tower of St.  Gregory's preserves its external form, though it is inwardly  consumed, as is the whole nave. I am inclined to judge that this is  substantially the appearance of the porch after the west end had  been fitted up for worship as Sancroft described. However, Wren had  condemned the structure as unsafe, and the Dean had acquiesced, and  the new cathedral was resolved upon.    There was delay, which was inevitable. Not only was the whole city  paralysed with the awful extent of the ruin, but there were questions  which had to be referred to Parliament, as to the method of raising  the funds. Happily the whole voice of the people was of one accord in  recognising that it was a paramount duty for the nation to build a  splendid cathedral, worthy of England and of her capital city. It  was not until November 1673 that the announcement was made of the  determination of the King and his Parliament to rebuild St. Paul's.  The history of that rebuilding belongs to New St. Paul's. The King  wanted to employ a French architect, Claude Perrault, who had built  the new front of the Louvre, but this was objected to. Then Denham,  whose life may be read in Johnson's Poets, and who wrote one poem  which may still be met with, _Cooper's Hill_, was appointed the King's  Surveyor, with Wren for his \"Coadjutor.\" Denham held the title to his  death, but had nothing to do with the work. He died next year, and  Wren then held unquestioned possession. His account of the old  building, the principal features of which have been borrowed in the  foregoing paper, is given in his son's book entitled _Parentalia_.  Our plan shows a change which Wren made as to the orientation.

CHAPTER XXVI.    THE BATTLE OF NAUVOO.      Leaving the main body of the Saints traveling westward, in this chapter I  wish to tell you about what happened to those who remained in Nauvoo; and  by the way, this is the last chapter of this little history in which mobs  will play an important part.    In the summer of 1846 there were about six hundred Saints in Nauvoo, most  of whom had been unable to get away. Many were poor, some were sick, and  there were many old people and children. Many non-\"Mormons\" had bought  property from the Saints who had left, and had moved into the city. The mob  called these friendly citizens \"Jack Mormons.\"    Naturally, one would think that these few Saints would be left to get ready  to move in peace; but not so. If there is any doubt of the brutal character  of the mob, what they now did will remove that doubt forever.    On July 11, eight brethren were engaged in cutting grain in a field twelve  miles from Nauvoo. A mob surrounded them, and then taking them one by one,  whipped them severely. Two of these mobbers were afterwards arrested, and  to get even for this, the mob carried away five other brethren who were  abused by the mobbers for twelve days before they were released.    The next move of the mob was to get writs of arrest for many persons in  Nauvoo. A John Carlin was unlawfully appointed a constable to serve these  writs, that is, make the arrests, and he raised a large body of men to help  him; but behind all this, the real object was to drive the remaining  \"Mormons\" from the city.    Governor Ford was now notified of the actions of these mobbers, and he sent  Major Parker to Nauvoo, who was to raise volunteers and defend the city.  Four companies of troops were organized by the governor's order; but  instead of treating the invaders as they truly were, a mob, Major Parker  made a treaty with their leader in which it was agreed that the \"Mormons\"  would leave the state within sixty days. The mob leader thought this fair  enough, but the mobbers did not. At this, their leader resigned and a man  by the name of Brockman took command of the crowd. He gave the order to  march towards Nauvoo, which they gladly did.    On the morning of September 10th, 1846, the watchman in the tower of the  temple gave notice that the enemy were coming 1,000 or 1,500 strong. They  had cannon, plenty of ammunition, and came like an army ready for battle.  Many of the new citizens fled, and the little band of defenders numbered  only one hundred and twenty-three men.    Meanwhile, a committee had come from Quincy to try to settle the troubles  without bloodshed. Although with them were Major Flood, sent by the  governor, and Mr. Wood, mayor of Quincy, the mob paid no attention to them,  and so they could do nothing.    There seemed no prospect but that the citizens would have to defend  themselves as best they could. Benjamin Clifford took command of the  volunteers, and Captain William Anderson organized a small body of  sharpshooters called the Spartan Band. As cannon were badly needed, the  brethren got two hollow steamboat shafts, cut them in two, plugged up one  end, and thus made some cannon. They had no cannon balls, but they used  scraps of iron and lead tied up into bags.    On Friday, the 11th, the mob drew up to the city and began firing. They  were met by the \"Mormon\" troops with their home-made cannon, which  surprised the mobbers very much, and they were compelled to stop their  advance.    On Saturday, the 12th, a flag of truce was brought into the city, and with  it a note to the commander at Nauvoo, stating that if they did not  surrender they would have to take the consequences. Major Clifford replied  that he had been sent by the governor to uphold the laws and that he was  going to do it, advising Brockman to disband his men.    The Nauvoo citizens had held their position during the night and had thrown  up some breastworks. The next day the battle waged fiercer than ever, but  the Nauvoo boys held their ground and the mob could not get in. Twelve  mobbers were wounded. The first one killed among the defenders was Augustus  Anderson, a \"Mormon\" boy fourteen years old. He left his mother that  morning saying he would fight for her, and went along with his father,  Captain William Anderson. Augustus was struck by a cannon ball, and died in  a few minutes. Shortly after Captain Anderson was also hit.    \"I am wounded,\" he cried. \"Take my gun and shoot on.\"    David Norris was also killed, and a number of other brethren wounded.    For six days that little band of brave defenders kept the mob at bay; and  even when it was seen to be useless to keep the fight up longer, many were  in favor of doing so.    On the 16th a treaty was made. The city was to surrender. The citizens were  not to be molested, and the sick and helpless were to be protected. The  \"Mormons\" were to leave as soon as possible.    The mob forces entered the city on the 17th; but it was the same old story.  They thought no more of promises or of the treaty. Bands of men went  through the city, stealing, insulting, and in every way abusing the people.  A gang went through the temple and up to the tower where they rang the  bell, yelled and shouted. A preacher who was in the mob went up to the top  of the tower and cried in a loud voice:    \"Peace! peace! peace! to the inhabitants of the earth, now the 'Mormons'  are driven!\"    The poor Saints had to get away as fast as they could. Some went north,  some south, but most of them crossed the river and camped on the low  bottoms of the Mississippi in Iowa. I shall not attempt to tell you of the  sufferings of these poor people; weak, sick hungry, cold, and wet. It would  make your heart ache to see the picture, one of the saddest in all our  history.    At this time, when it seemed as though these people would starve to death,  a strange thing happened. Great flocks of quail came flying into camp. They  flew against the wagons with such force that they were killed or stunned,  so that they could be picked up. They also alighted all over the camp and  were so tame that they could be taken by the hand. Thus the Lord sent food  to his hungry children.    If you wish to read a very interesting account of this removal from Nauvoo,  read Colonel Kane's lecture, found in many of our larger histories.[2]    Topics.--1.

CHAPTER XXVII.    WESTWARD.      The moving of a nation! What a task it must have been!    Most of you have had some experience in moving, it may be only a family  moving from one house to another, and you know what a lot of worry and work  there are in such a small affair; but here was a nation moving!    This great exodus was very much like the time when the children of Israel  went from under the oppression of Egypt out into the wilderness to journey  to the promised land. When at Nauvoo, Brigham Young said to the Saints: \"To  your tents, O Israel,\" they knew they had another Moses to lead them from  their persecutors.    The camp at Sugar creek grew larger every day through the arrival of exiles  from Nauvoo. Many did not bring provisions enough with them, so that they  were forced to go to the neighboring farms and settlements and work for  corn.    The first move the camp made was on March 1, 1846, when four hundred wagons  started forward. Five miles only was traveled that day, and when they  camped, the snow had to be shovelled away where they pitched their tents.    From that time the Saints moved slowly westward across the territory of  Iowa. As they advanced, the spring rains came and often drenched the  travelers through. The ground now became very muddy, and it was so hard for  the poor teams that some days only a few miles were traveled. Sometimes  their camping places were so wet that they who slept on the ground would  have to lay on branches of trees so that they would not sink into the mud.    At first there was very little feed for their animals, and they had to live  on the bark and twigs of trees, with what, corn could be spared for them.  Many horses were traded for oxen, as they could stand such hardship better.  Trips were made to the nearest settlements to buy food. Those who had no  money traded what they could spare, such as dishes and feather beds for  corn.    For the first few weeks there was not much order in their way of traveling;  but on March 27th the Saints were more perfectly organized. Brigham Young  was sustained as president of the whole camp. Then captains were appointed  over hundreds, over fifties, and over tens. Clerks were chosen to keep the  records, etc., and men were called to see to the buying and distributing of  the food. Thus every one had something to do and everything was done in  order.    [Illustration: A PIONEER TRAIN.]    Often in the evening when supper had been eaten, the logs were piled on the  bonfire, a space was cleared, the musicians brought out their instruments,  and the sorrows and hardships of the day were forgotten in the innocent  dance.    The camp always rested on Sundays, and if the weather would permit,  meetings were held.    On April 24th a point on Grand river was reached, one hundred and  forty-five miles north-west "]]]
