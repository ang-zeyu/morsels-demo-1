It is  low, and seemed to form some creeks or coves; and, as we got farther into  the passage, we perceived some small low isles lying along it, which seemed  to extend behind St Bartholomew Island.    Having now finished the survey of the whole archipelago, the season of the  year made it necessary for me to return to the south, while I had yet some  time left to explore any land I might meet with between this and New  Zealand; where I intended to touch, that I might refresh my people, and  recruit our stock of wood and water for another southern course. With this  view, at five p.m. we tacked, and hauled to the southward with a fresh gale  at S.E. At this time the N.W. point of the passage, or the S.W. point of  the island Tierra del Espiritu Santo, the only remains of Quiros's  continent, bore N. 82 deg. W., distant three leagues. I named it Cape Lisburne,  and its situation is in latitude 15 deg. 40', longitude 165 deg. 59' E.    The foregoing account of these islands, in the order in which we explored  them, not being particular enough either as to situation or description, it  may not be improper now to give a more accurate view of them, which will  convey to the reader a better idea of the whole groupe.    The northern islands of this archipelago were first discovered by that  great navigator Quiros in 1606; and, not without reason, were considered as  part of the southern continent, which, at that time, and until very lately,  was supposed to exist. They were next visited by M. de Bougainville, in  1768; who, besides landing on the Isle of Lepers, did no more than discover  that the land was not connected, but composed of islands, which he called  the Great Cyclades. But as, besides ascertaining the extent and situation  of these islands, we added to them several new ones which were not known  before, and explored the whole, I think we have obtained a right to name  them; and shall in future distinguish them by the name of the New Hebrides.  They are situated between the latitude of 14 deg. 29' and 20 deg. 4' S., and  between 166 deg. 41' and 170 deg. 21' E. longitude, and extend an hundred and  twenty-five leagues in the direction of N.N.W. 1/2 W. and S.S.E. 1/2 E.    The most northern island is that called by M. de Bougainville, Peak of the  Etoile; it is situated, according to his account, in latitude, 14 deg. 29',  longitude 168 deg. 9'; and N. by W., eight leagues from Aurora.    The next island, which lies farthest north, is that of Tierra del Espiritu  Santo. It is the most western and largest of all the Hebrides, being  twenty-two leagues long, in the direction of N.N.W. 1/2 W. and S.S.E. 1/2  E., twelve in breadth, and sixty in circuit. We have obtained the true  figure of this island very accurately. The land of it, especially the west  side, is exceedingly high and mountainous; and, in many places the hills  rise directly from the sea. Except the cliffs and beaches, every other part  is covered with wood, or laid out in plantations. Besides the bay of St  Philip and St Jago, the isles which lie along the south and east coast,  cannot, in my opinion, fail of forming some good bays or harbours.    The next considerable island is that of Mallicollo. To the S.E. it extends  N.W. and S.E., and is eighteen leagues long in that direction. Its greatest  breadth, which is at the S.E., end, is eight leagues. The N.W. end is  two-thirds this breadth, and near the middle, one-third. This contraction is  occasioned by a wide and pretty deep bay on the S.W. side. To judge of this  island from what we saw of it, it must be very fertile and well inhabited.  The land on the sea-coast is rather low, and lies with a gentle slope from  the hills which are in the middle of the island. Two-thirds of the N.E.  coast was only seen at a great distance; therefore the delineations of it  can have no pretensions to accuracy; but the other parts, I apprehend, are  without any material errors.    St Bartholomew lies between the S.E. end of Tierra del Espiritu Santo, and  the north end of Mallicollo; and the distance between it and the latter is  eight miles. This is the passage through which M. de Bougainville went; and  the middle of it is in latitude 15 deg. 48'.    The Isle of Lepers lies between Espiritu Santo and Aurora Island, eight  leagues from the former, and three from the latter, in latitude 15 deg. 22',  and nearly under the same meridian as the S.E.. end of Mallicollo. It is of  an egg-like figure, very high, and eighteen or twenty leagues in circuit.  Its limits were determined by several bearings; but the lines of the shore  were traced out by guess, except the N.E. part where there is anchorage  half a mile from the land.    Aurora, Whitsuntide, Ambrym, Paoom, and its neighbour Apee, Threehills, and  Sandwich Islands, lie all nearly under the meridian of 167 deg. 29' or 30' E.,  extending from the latitude of 14 deg. 51' 30\", to 17 deg. 53' 30\".    The island of Aurora lies N. by W. and S. by E., and is eleven leagues long  in that direction; but I believe, it hardly any where exceeds two or two  and a half in breadth. It hath a good height, its surface hilly, and every  where covered with wood, except where the natives have their dwellings and  plantations.    Whitsuntide Isle, which is one league and a half to the south of Aurora, is  of the same length, and lies in the direction of north and south, but is  something broader than Aurora Island. It is considerably high, and clothed  with wood, except such parts as seemed to be cultivated, which were pretty  numerous.    From the south end of Whitsuntide Island to the north side of Ambrym is two  leagues and a half. This is about seventeen leagues in circuit; its shores  are rather low, but the land rises with an unequal ascent to a tolerably  high mountain in the middle of the island, from which ascended great  columns of smoke; but we were not able to determine whether this was  occasioned by a volcano or not. That it is fertile and well inhabited,  seems probable from the quantities of smoke which we saw rise out of the  woods, in such parts of the island as came within the compass of our sight;  for it must be observed, that we did not see the whole of it.    We saw still much less of Paoom and its neighbourhood. I can say no more of  this island than that it towers up to a great height in the form of a round  hay-stack; and the extent of it, and of the adjoining isle (if there are  two), cannot exceed three or four leagues in any direction; for the  distance between Ambrym and Apee is hardly five; and they lie in this  space, and east from Port Sandwich, distant about seven or eight leagues.    The island of Apee is not less than twenty leagues in circuit; its longest  direction is about eight leagues N.W. and S.E.; it is of considerable  height; and hath a hilly surface diversified with woods and lawns, the west  and south parts especially; for the others we did not see.    Shepherd's Isles are a group of small ones of unequal size, extending off  from the S.E. point of Apee about five leagues in the direction of S.E.    The island Threehills lies south four leagues from the coast of Apee, and  S.E. 1/2 S., distant seventeen leagues from Port Sandwich; to this, and  what hath been already said of it, I shall only add, that W. by N., five  miles from the west point, is a reef of rocks on which the sea continually  breaks.    Nine leagues, in the direction of south, from Threehills, lies Sandwich  Island. Twohills, the Monument, and Montagu Islands, lie to the east of  this line, and Hinchinbrook to the west, as also two or three small isles  which lie between it and Sandwich Island, to which they are connected by  breakers.    Sandwich Island is twenty-five leagues in circuit; its greatest extent is  ten leagues; and it lies in the direction of N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. The  N.W. coast of this island we only viewed at a distance; therefore our chart  of this part may be faulty so far as it regards the line of the coast, but  no farther. The distance from the south end of Mallicollo to the N.W. end  of Sandwich Island, is twenty-two leagues in the direction of S.S.E. 1/2 E.    In the same direction lie Erromango, Tanna, and Annatom. The first is  eighteen leagues from Sandwich Island, and is twenty-four or twenty-five  leagues in circuit. The middle of it lies in the latitude of 18 deg. 54',  longitude 169 deg. 19' E., and it is of a good height, as may be gathered from  the distance we were off when we first saw it.    Tanna lies six leagues from the south side of Erromango, extending S.E. by  S. and N.W. by N., about eight leagues long in that direction, and every  where about three or four leagues broad.    The isle of Immer lies in the direction of N. by E. 1/2 E., four leagues  from Port Resolution in Tanna; and the island of Erronan or Footoona East,  in the same direction, distant eleven leagues. This, which is the most  eastern island of all the Hebrides, did not appear to be above five leagues  in circuit, but is of a considerable height and flat at top. On the N.E.  side is a little peak seemingly disjointed from the isle; but we thought it  was connected by low land. Annatom, which is the southernmost island, is  situated in the latitude of 20 deg. 3', longitude 170 deg. 4', and S. 30 deg. E.,  eleven or twelve leagues from Port Resolution. It is of a good height, with  an hilly surface; and more I must not say of it.    Here follow the lunar observations by Mr Wales, for ascertaining the  longitude of these islands, reduced by the watch to Port Sandwich in  Mallicollo, and Port Resolution in Tanna.

Several of her grown children gathered round and laughed with hearty  approval at her impersonations, and at last her husband came in smiling  and sat near, joining in the songs of the frog and the locust, to the  great merriment of their children.      =The Coyote and the Turtle,= as told by Guanyanum Sacknumptewa    \"A long time ago, there were many turtles living in the Little Colorado  River near Homolovi, southeast of Winslow, where Hopi used to live. And  there was a coyote living there too, and of course, he was always  hungry.    \"Now one day the turtles decided they would climb out of the river and  go hunt some food, for there was a kind of cactus around there that they  like very much. But one of the turtles had a baby and she didn't like to  wake it up and take it with her because it was sleeping so nicely. So  they just went along and left the baby asleep.    \"After a while the little turtle woke up and he said, 'Where is my  mother? She must have gone somewhere and left me. O, I must go and find  her!'    \"So the baby turtle saw that the others had crawled up the bank, and he  followed their tracks for a little way. But he soon got tired and just  stopped under a bush and began to cry. (Note: Her imitation of the  crying was good. H.G.L.)    \"Now the coyote was coming along and he heard the poor little turtle  crying. So he came up and said, 'That's a pretty song; now go on and  sing for me.'    \"But the baby turtle said, I'm not singing, I'm crying.'    \"'Go on and sing,' said the coyote, 'I want to hear you sing.'    \"'I can't sing,' said the poor baby, 'I'm crying and I want my mother.'    \"'You'd better sing for me, or I'll eat you up,' said the big hungry  coyote.    \"'O, I can't sing--I just can't stop crying,' said the baby, and he  cried harder and harder.    \"'Well,' the big coyote said, 'if you don't sing for me I'm going to  eat you right up.' The coyote was mad, and he was very hungry. 'All  right, then, I'll just eat you,' he said.    Now the little turtle thought of something. So he said, 'Well, I can't  sing, so I guess you'll have to eat me. But that's all right, for it  won't hurt me any; here inside of my shell I'll go right on living  inside of you.'    \"Now the coyote thought about this a little bit and didn't like the idea  very well.    \"Then the baby turtle said, 'You can do anything you want with me, just  so you don't throw me into the river, for I don't want to drown.'    \"Now the old coyote was pretty mad and he wanted to be as mean as  possible. So he just picked that baby up in his mouth and carried him  over to the river and threw him in.    \"Then the baby turtle was very happy; he stuck his little head out of  his shell and stretched out his feet and started swimming off toward the  middle of the river. And he said, 'Goodbye, Mr. Coyote, and thank you  very much for bringing me back to my house so that I didn't have to walk  back.' And the little turtle laughed at the old coyote, who got madder  and madder because he had let the little turtle go. But he couldn't get  him now, so he just went home. And the baby turtle was still laughing  when his mother got home, and she laughed too. And those turtles are  still living in that water. (Note: Here is manifest all the subtlety of  \"The Tar Baby,\" though generations older. H.G.L.)      =The Frog and the Locust,= as told by Guanyanum Sacknumptewa    \"Qowakina was a place where Paqua, the frog, lived. One day he was  sitting on a little wet ground singing a prayer for rain, for it was  getting very hot and dry and that was Paqua's way of bringing the rain,  so he had a very good song like this. (Note: Here she sang a pretty  little song, very rhythmic, and her body swayed gently in time to the  music. It occurred to the writer that this would make a good bedtime  story and the little song, a lullaby, for it went on and on with  pleasing variation. H.G.L.)    \"Not far away Mahu, the locust, was sitting in a bush, and he was  singing too, for he was getting pretty dusty and the weather was very  hot, and so he, too, was praying for rain. He has a very nice song for  rain, and it goes this way. (Note: Here came a lovely little humming  song whose words could not be interpreted, since they were but syllables  and sounds having no meaning in English. However, these sounds had a  definite order and rhythm. At this point the husband smilingly joined in  the song, and the unison of both sounds and rhythm was perfect. H.G.L.)    \"By and by the locust heard the frog, so he came over and asked him what  he was doing. The frog said he was hot and wanted it to rain; that's why  he was singing. Then the locust said, 'Now isn't that strange, that's  exactly what I do to make it rain, too, and that's the best thing to  do.' So they both sang.    \"Pretty soon they noticed that the clouds had been coming up while they  were singing, and before long it rained, and they both were happy.    \"After this they were always great friends because they had found out  they both had the same idea about something.\"          XII. CONCLUSION           *       *       *       *       *    For some years the writer has been merely a friendly neighbor to these  friendly people, and this past summer she spent some time among her Hopi  friends, studying their present-day life, domestic and ceremonial, and  listening to their stories. The foregoing pages record her observations,  supplemented largely by the recordings of well-known authorities who  have studied these people.    To her own mind it is clear that the Hopi are living today by their  age-old and amazingly primitive traditions, as shown by their planting,  hunting, house building, textile and ceramic arts, and their ceremonies  for birth, marriage, burial, rain-making, etc. Even their favorite  stories for amusement are traditional. Surely this can not last much  longer in these days when easy transportation is bringing the modern  world to their very door. Only a few years ago they were geographically  isolated and had been so for centuries. Culturally, the Hopi are not a  new, raw people, but old, mature, long a sedentary and peaceful people,  building up during the ages a vast body of traditional literature  embodying law, religion, civic and social order, with definite patterns  for the whole fabric of their life from the cradle to the grave and on  into Maskim, the home of Hopi Souls. It is because they have so long  been left alone, with their own culture so well suited to their nature  and to their environment, that we find them so satisfied to remain as  they are, friendly, even cordial, but conservative.    The Hopi is glad to use the white man's wagon, cook stove, sugar, and  coffee, but he prefers his own religion, government, social customs--the  great things handed down in his traditions. Their very conservatism is  according to one of their oldest traditions, which is:      =Tradition for Walking Beside the White Man But in Footsteps of Fathers=    In 1885, Wicki, chief of the Antelope Society at Walpi, told Mr. A.M.  Stephen one of the most complete and interesting variants ever collected  of the Snake myth.    One of its interesting details concerns a prophesy of the manner in  which the Hopitah are to take on the White man's culture. In plain words  the Spider Woman tells Tiyo that a time will come when men with white  skins and a strange tongue shall come among the Hopitah, and the Snake  Brotherhood, having brave hearts, will be first to make friends and  learn good from them. But the Hopitah are not to follow in the white  men's footsteps but to walk _beside them_, always keeping in the  footsteps of their fathers![36]    That is just what the Hopi are doing today.
