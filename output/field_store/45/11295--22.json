Never had the unfortunate king so fair a  prospect of being restored to his inheritance of the Palatinate as  at that time, and had King James, his father-in-law, had a soul  answerable to the occasion, it had been effected before, but it was a  strange thing to see him equipped from the English court with one lord  and about forty or fifty English gentlemen in his attendance, whereas  had the King of England now, as 'tis well known he might have done,  furnished him with 10,000 or 12,000 English foot, nothing could have  hindered him taking a full possession of his country; and yet even  without that help did the King of Sweden clear almost his whole  country of Imperialists, and after his death reinstal his son in the  Electorate; but no thanks to us.    The Lord Craven did me the honour to inquire for me by name, and his  Majesty of Sweden did me yet more by presenting me to the King of  Bohemia, and my Lord Craven gave me a letter from my father. And  speaking something of my father having served under the Prince of  Orange in the famous battle of Nieuport, the king, smiling, returned,  \"And pray tell him from me his son has served as well in the warm  battle of Leipsic.\"    My father being very much pleased with the honour I had received from  so great a king, had ordered me to acquaint his Majesty that, if he  pleased to accept of their service, he would raise him a regiment of  English horse at his own charge to be under my command, and to be  sent over into Holland; and my Lord Craven had orders from the King of  England to signify his consent to the said levy. I acquainted my old  friend Sir John Hepburn with the contents of the letter in order to  have his advice, who being pleased with the proposal, would have me  go to the king immediately with the letter, but present service put it  off for some days.    The taking of Creutznach was the next service of any moment. The king  drew out in person to the siege of this town. The town soon came to  parley, but the castle seemed a work of difficulty, for its situation  was so strong and so surrounded with works behind and above one and  another, that most people thought the king would receive a check  from it; but it was not easy to resist the resolution of the King of  Sweden.    He never battered it but with two small pieces, but having viewed the  works himself, ordered a mine under the first ravelin, which being  sprung with success, he commands a storm. I think there was not  more commanded men than volunteers, both English, Scots, French, and  Germans. My old comrade was by this time recovered of his wound at  Leipsic, and made one. The first body of volunteers, of about forty,  were led on by my Lord Craven, and I led the second, among whom were  most of the reformado Scots officers who took the castle of Oppenheim.  The first party was not able to make anything of it; the garrison  fought with so much fury that many of the volunteer gentlemen being  wounded, and some killed, the rest were beaten off with loss. The king  was in some passion at his men, and rated them for running away, as he  called it, though they really retreated in good order, and commanded  the assault to be renewed. 'Twas our turn to fall on next. Our Scots  officers, not being used to be beaten, advanced immediately, and my  Lord Craven with his volunteers pierced in with us, fighting gallantly  in the breach with a pike in his hand; and, to give him the honour due  to his bravery, he was with the first on the top of the rampart, and  gave his hand to my comrade, and lifted him up after him. We helped  one another up, till at last almost all the volunteers had gained  the height of the ravelin, and maintained it with a great deal of  resolution, expecting when the commanded men had gained the same  height to advance upon the enemy; when one of the enemy's captains  called to my Lord Craven, and told him if they might have honourable  terms they would capitulate, which my lord telling him he would engage  for, the garrison fired no more, and the captain, leaping down from  the next rampart, came with my Lord Craven into the camp, where the  conditions were agreed on, and the castle surrendered.    After the taking of this town, the king, hearing of Tilly's approach,  and how he had beaten Gustavus Horn, the king's field-marshal, out of  Bamberg, began to draw his forces together, and leaving the care of  his conquests in these parts to his chancellor Oxenstiern, prepares to  advance towards Bavaria.    I had taken an opportunity to wait upon his Majesty with Sir John  Hepburn and being about to introduce the discourse of my father's  letter, the king told me he had received a compliment on my account  in a letter from King Charles. I told him his Majesty had by his  exceeding generosity bound me and all my friends to pay their  acknowledgments to him, and that I supposed my father had obtained  such a mention of it from the King of England, as gratitude moved him  to that his Majesty's favour had been shown in me to a family both  willing and ready to serve him, that I had received some commands from  my father, which, if his Majesty pleased to do me the honour to accept  of, might put me in a condition to acknowledge his Majesty's goodness  in a manner more proportioned to the sense I had of his favour; and  with that I produced my father's letter, and read that clause in it  which related to the regiment of horse, which was as follows:--    \"I read with a great deal of satisfaction the account you give of the  great and extraordinary conquests of the King of Sweden, and with more  his Majesty's singular favour to you; I hope you will be careful to  value and deserve so much honour. I am glad you rather chose to serve  as a volunteer at your own charge, than to take any command, which,  for want of experience, you might misbehave in.    \"I have obtained of the king that he will particularly thank his  Majesty of Sweden for the honour he has done you, and if his Majesty  gives you so much freedom, I could be glad you should in the humblest  manner thank his Majesty in the name of an old broken soldier.    \"If you think yourself officer enough to command them, and his Majesty  pleased to accept them, I would have you offer to raise his Majesty  a regiment of horse, which, I think, I may near complete in our  neighbourhood with some of your old acquaintance, who are very willing  to see the world. If his Majesty gives you the word, they shall  receive his commands in the Maes, the king having promised me to give  them arms, and transport them for that service into Holland; and I  hope they may do his Majesty such service as may be for your honour  and the advantage of his Majesty's interest and glory.\"    \"YOUR LOVING FATHER.\"    \"'Tis an offer like a gentleman and like a soldier,\" says the king,\"  and I'll accept of it on two conditions: first,\" says the king, \"that  I will pay your father the advance money for the raising the regiment;  and next, that they shall be landed in the Weser or the Elbe; for  which, if the King of England will not, I will pay the passage; for  if they land in Holland, it may prove very difficult to get them to us  when the army shall be marched out of this part of the country.\"    I returned this answer to my father, and sent my man George into  England to order that regiment, and made him quartermaster. I sent  blank commissions for the officers, signed by the king, to be filled  up as my father should think fit; and when I had the king's order for  the commissions, the secretary told me I must go back to the king with  them. Accordingly I went back to the king, who, opening the packet,  laid all the commissions but one upon a table before him, and bade  me take them, and keeping that one still in his hand, \"Now,\" says he,  \"you are one of my soldiers,\" and therewith gave me his commission, as  colonel of horse in present pay. I took the commission kneeling,  and humbly thanked his Majesty. \"But,\" says the king, \"there is one  article-of-war I expect of you more than of others.\" \"Your Majesty can  expect nothing of me which I shall not willingly comply with,\" said I,  \"as soon as I have the honour to understand what it is.\" \"Why, it is,\"  says the king, \"that you shall never fight but when you have orders,  for I shall not be willing to lose my colonel before I have the  regiment.\" \"I shall be ready at all times, sir,\" returned I, \"to obey  your Majesty's orders.\"    I sent my man express with the king's answer and the commission to my  father, who had the regiment completed in less than two months' time,  and six of the officers, with a list of the rest, came away to me,  whom I presented to his Majesty when he lay before Nuremberg, where  they kissed his hand.    One of the captains offered to bring the whole regiment travelling as  private men into the army in six weeks' time, and either to transport  their equipage, or buy it in Germany, but 'twas thought impracticable.  However, I had so many come in that manner that I had a complete troop  always about me, and obtained the king's order to muster them as a  troop.    On the 8th of March the king decamped, and, marching up the river  Maine, bent his course directly for Bavaria, taking several small  places by the way, and expecting to engage with Tilly, who he thought  would dispute his entrance into Bavaria, kept his army together; but  Tilly, finding himself too weak to encounter him, turned away, and  leaving Bavaria open to the king, marched into the Upper Palatinate.  The king finding the country clear of the Imperialists comes to  Nuremberg, made his entrance into that city the 21st of March, and  being nobly treated by the citizens, he continued his march into  Bavaria, and on the 26th sat down before Donauwerth.

It will doubtless be used rather as a book of  reference than as a readable treatise. E. W. TAYLOR.        VERBRECHERTYPEN.  1 Heft.  Geliebtenmorder von Albrecht Wetzel und Karl  Wilmanns.  Verlag Julius Springer, Berlin:  1913.    With a better understanding of psychopathic phenomena, the underlying  psychology of criminology becomes more clearly defined. Maladjustment may  express itself in an insane outbreak, criminal act, or in an anti-social  deed, indeed, in all of them the underlying phenomenon is a psychopathic  condition which comes under the realm of abnormal psychology.  The large  group of criminals SHOULD not be looked upon as a homogenous class, but the  individuality of criminal and the type of the delinquent act in reaction to  his heredity, mental make-up and environmental influences should be fully  considered. Herein lies the great value of Wetzel's and Willmann's  Monograph--these authors report three cases in which criminal acts were  attributed to abnormal mental life.    The first case was that of a young man of twenty-three, who showed a  psychopathic personality with tainted heredity on the paternal side. He was  subject to convulsive attacks, which were regarded as hysterical and not  epileptic.  In his intelligence he was above the average. He was engaged to  a young woman, and because she refused to marry him, he at first  contemplated to take his life, but later shot at her three times without  injuring her, and then made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide. His  delinquent act was determined not only by his environment, but also by his  peculiar type of personality, which was taken into consideration by the  court, and on this ground he was acquitted.    In the second case, a young man of twenty shot his fiancee through the  temporal region, injuring her severely. Soon after committing this act he  surrendered himself to the police. He also showed striking evidences of a  psychopathic personality with a strong suggestion of epilepsy, but with  intact intelligence. He was given to periods of depression and was unstable  mentally. He was easily suggestible and his general conduct was not only  controlled by environmental influences, but also by his mood. Suicidal ideas  and jealousy played a very important role in his mental life; especially  they were marked when he began to keep company with the young woman.  Although his abnormal constitution was taken into account, nevertheless he  was punished by one year's imprisonment. During confinement he attempted  suicide, but was unsuccessful. Some time after his release he committed  suicide, the cause of which he assigned to an abortion that was induced by  his sweetheart.    The third case is very interesting and rather intricate, by reason of the  fact that murder or double suicide was suspected. The following are the  details of this case:  A young man of eighteen kept company with a young  woman about the same age, from another town. The girls of the town were  jealous of her and began to gossip about her to the extent of casting  aspersions upon her character, etc. The young man's father, without  investigating this case, forbade his son to marry her.  However, the two  lovers would have frequent secret rendezvous, and his fiancee became  depressed over this scandalous and groundless rumor and also because of the  peculiar attitude her young man's father assumed. One evening the young man  returned home late, and upon confessing to his father of his secret meetings  with his fiancee, he was severely beaten and prohibited to see her again.    A few days later the young man wrote a letter to his sweetheart, telling her  of his father's emphatic determinations, but soon they met again and she  suggested that they should die together on account of this gossip that was  circulated about her. A day following this meeting both of them were missed,  and after some search the young woman was found lying on the ground with two  shots in her head and one in the breast, and the young man was hanging from  a tree, in a near-by wood; the latter was resuscitated, but the former was  dead. It is interesting to note that the autopsy showed that death in her  case was due to strangulation and not to the bullets. This young man was  endowed with a psychopathic personality, and there was a history of short  attacks of depression. He received several head traumata and suffered from  enuresis in his early life.    Following the resuscitation, he grew confused and excited, and within  twenty-four hours he recovered from the acute episode but showed incomplete  amnesia for his act.  He stated that he remembered firing the shots, but had  no remembrance of strangulating her. Soon after this he passed into a  peculiar state of confusion; in addition, fabrications and retention defect  were also demonstrated. The cerebrospinal fluid revealed some abnormal  changes which were suggestive of an organic brain disease.  The Wassermann  test was negative.  Finally, he made a complete recovery except for the  incomplete amnesia.    Since the death of the young woman was caused by strangulation, the question  had to be decided whether he was the cause of her death or she died as the  result of her own hand.  The court favored suicide, and held that the bodily  injury was inflicted with the pistol by the young man. He received a lenient  sentence--only nine months imprisonment. In this case, the type of his  personality, and all the circumstances that led to the development of the  act were taken into consideration.    Although the authors presented this subject purely objectively, yet their  studies are extremely interesting and important, and show conclusively the  importance of psychopathological methods in criminology.  One who is  interested in this subject will find this monograph of great value and help.  It may also be added that the authors give a complete list of the casuistic  literature of the murder among lovers. MORRIS J. KARPAS.        DEVELOPMENT AND PURPOSE.  AN ESSAY TOWARDS A PHILOSOPHY OF EVOLUTION. By L.  T. Hobhouse, Martin White Professor of Sociology in the University of  London.  Macmillan & Co., London:  1913; pp.  xxix, 383.    \"Development and Purpose\" is essentially the complement of Professor  Hobhouse's well-known and valuable \"Mind in Evolution,\" published in 1901;  if it were rather a continuation than the complement, many would be pleased,  for the exposition already made practically guarantees a rich application,  were it undertaken, to matters still further \"away\" in the realm of thought.  The present volume lacks the multitude of scientific data and references  which make \"Mind in Evolution\" so important for the study of psychology (as  behavior or not as behavior, as the reader pleases), but it contains in  their space many timely discussions, in some cases seemingly prophetic, of  teleology in its relation to evolution.    The seventeen chapters of the book (there is also an extremely thoughtful  Introduction and a full Index), are divided into two parts, one entitled  \"Lines of Development\" and the other \"The Conditions of Development.\"  The  reviewer's lazy cortex, and possibly those of other and more leisurely  readers, is made glad by a complete chapter-synopsis or syllabus, occupying  seven pages). So much of the whole treatise is suggested in the synopsis of  the first three chapters that it is well to give them in full, as follows:    \"I. The Nature and the Significance of Mental Evolution. (1) The biological  view regards Mind as an organ evolved to adapt behavior to the environment,  (2) and tends to reduce its action to a mechanical process.  (3) Parallelism  in the end reduces Mind to an epi-phenomenon {an important undoubted fact  which has been often ignored by what are left of the Parallelists!] (4) The  object of Comparative Psychology is to determine empirically the actual  function of Mind in successive stages of development. (5) It involves a  social as well as an individual psychology. (6) The statement of the higher  phases also opens up philosophical questions, (7) and on the solution of  these depends the final interpretation of the recorded movement.    \"II.  The Structure of Mind.  (1) Mental operations are known in the first  instance as objects of consciousness. (2) Mind is the permanent unity  including consciousness and the sum of processes continuous with  consciousness and determining it. (3) These processes involve, but are not  identical with physical processes, constituting with them a psychophysical  unity.    \"III.  The General Function of Mind and Brain.  (1) The generic function of  Mind, as of the nervous system, is correlation (2) The special organ for  effecting fresh correlation is consciousness. (3) The deliverances of  consciousness arise from stimuli acting upon structures built up by  experience, (4) on foundations laid by heredity, (5) which supplies not only  specific adaptations, but a background to the entire life of consciousness.\"    It would be hard to find a more concise, complete, and timely  formularization of the seeming trend of present resultants in this  particular direction than these sentences set forth for whomsoever will  ponder each carefully-built statement and really understand what it means as  part of a system. \"Mind is the permanent unity including consciousness and  the sum of processes continuous with consciousness and determining it. These  processes involve, but are not identical with, physical processes,  constituting with them a psychophysical unity,\"--this quotation might almost  serve as the motto of early Twentieth Century scientific philosophy. It  seems to the present reviewer to have almost as much philosophy in it as  Harold Hoffding's well-known sentence has of psychology: (\"the unity of  mental life has its expression not only in memory and synthesis, but also in  a"]]]
