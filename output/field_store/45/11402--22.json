In the corresponding room, opposite, slept our hosts;  while the third was the living and dining room. A long table, raw-hide  bottomed chairs, a large sideboard, bookcases, a long easy settee with  pillows, gun racks, photographs in and out of frames, a table with  writing materials, and books and magazines everywhere--not to speak of  again the skins of many animals completely covering the floor. Out  behind, in small, separate buildings, laboured the cook, and dwelt the  stores, the bath-tub, and other such necessary affairs.    As soon as we had consumed the usual grateful lime juice and sparklets,  we followed our hosts into the open air to look around.    On this high, airy hill top the Hills some day are going to build them a  real house. In anticipation they have laid out grounds and have planted  many things. In examining these my California training stood by me. Out  there, as here, one so often examines his own and his neighbours'  gardens, not for what they are but for what they shall become. His  imagination can exalt this tiny seedling to the impressiveness of  spreading noontime shade; can magnify yonder apparent duplicate to the  full symmetry of a shrub; can ruthlessly diminish the present importance  of certain grand and lofty growths to its true status of flower or  animal. So from a dead uniformity of size he casts forward in the years  to a pleasing variation of shade, of jungle, of open glade, of flowered  vista; and he goes away full of expert admiration for \"X.'s bully  garden.\" With this solid training beneath me I was able on this occasion  to please immensely.    From the house site we descended the slope to where the ostriches and  the cattle and the people were in the late sunlight swarming upward from  the plains pastures below. These people were, to the chief extent,  Wakamba, quite savage, but attracted here by the justness and fair  dealing of the Hills. Some of them farmed on shares with the Hills, the  white men furnishing the land and seed, and the black men the labour;  some of them laboured on wage; some few herded cattle or ostriches; some  were hunters and took the field only when, as now, serious business was  afoot. They had their complete villages, with priests, witch doctors,  and all; and they seemed both contented and fond of the two white men.    As we walked about we learned much of the ostrich business; and in the  course of our ten days' visit we came to a better realization of how  much there is to think of in what appears basically so simple a  proposition.    In the nesting time, then, the Hills went out over the open country,  sometimes for days at a time, armed with long high-power telescopes.  With these fearsome and unwieldy instruments they surveyed the country  inch by inch from the advantage of a kopje. When thus they discovered a  nest, they descended and appropriated the eggs. The latter, hatched at  home in an incubator, formed the nucleus of a flock.    Pass the raising of ostrich chicks to full size through the difficulties  of disease, wild beasts, and sheer cussedness. Of the resultant thirty  birds or so of the season's catch, but two or three will even promise  good production. These must be bred in captivity with other likely  specimens. Thus after several years the industrious ostrich farmer may  become possessed of a few really prime birds. To accumulate a proper  flock of such in a new country is a matter of a decade or so. Extra  prime birds are as well known and as much in demand for breeding as any  blood horse in a racing country. Your true ostrich enthusiast, like the  Hills, possesses trunks full of feathers not good commercially, but  intensely interesting for comparison and for the purposes of prophecy.  While I stayed with them came a rumour of a very fine plucking a distant  neighbour had just finished from a likely two-year-old. The Hills were  manifestly uneasy until one of them had ridden the long distance to  compare this newcomer's product with that of their own two-year-olds.  And I shall never forget the reluctantly admiring shake of the head with  which he acknowledged that it was indeed a \"very fine feather!\"    But getting the birds is by no means all of ostrich farming, as many  eager experimenters have discovered to their cost. The birds must have a  certain sort of pasture land; and their paddocks must be built on an  earth that will not soil or break the edges of the new plumes.    And then there is the constant danger of wild beasts. When a man has  spent years in gathering suitable flocks, he cannot be blamed for wild  anger when, as happened while I was in the country, lions kill sixty or  seventy birds in a night. The ostrich seems to tempt lions greatly. The  beasts will make their way through and over the most complicated  defences. Any ostrich farmer's life is a constant warfare against them.  Thus the Hills had slain sixty-eight lions in and near their farm--a  tremendous record. Still the beasts continued to come in. My hosts  showed me, with considerable pride, their arrangements finally evolved  for night protection.    The ostriches were confined in a series of heavy corrals, segregating  the birds of different ages. Around the outside of this group of  enclosures ran a wide ring corral in which were confined the numerous  cattle; and as an outer wall to this were built the huts of the Wakamba  village. Thus to penetrate to the ostriches the enterprising lion would  have to pass both the people, the cattle, and the strong thorn and log  structures that contained them.    This subject brings me to another set of acquaintances we had already  made--the dogs.    These consisted of an Airedale named Ruby; two setters called Wayward  and Girlie; a heavy black mongrel, Nero; ditto brindle, Ben; and a  smaller black and white ditto, Ranger. They were very nice friendly  doggy dogs, but they did not look like lion hunters. Nevertheless, Hill  assured us that they were of great use in the sport, and promised us  that on the following day we should see just how.          XVIII    THE FIRST LIONESS.      At an early hour we loaded our bedding, food, tents, and camp outfit on  a two-wheeled wagon drawn by four of the humpbacked native oxen, and  sent it away across the plains, with instructions to make camp on a  certain kopje. Clifford Hill and myself, accompanied by our gunbearers  and syces, then rode leisurely down the length of a shallow brushy canon  for a mile or so. There we dismounted and sat down to await the arrival  of the others. These--including Harold Hill, Captain D., five or six  Wakamba spearmen, our own carriers, and the dogs--came along more  slowly, beating the bottoms on the off chance of game.    The sun was just warming, and the bees and insects were filling the air  with their sleepy droning sounds. The hillside opposite showed many  little outcrops of rocks so like the hills of our own Western States  that it was somewhat difficult to realize that we were in Africa. For  some reason the delay was long. Then suddenly all four of us  simultaneously saw the same thing. A quarter-mile away and on the  hillside opposite a magnificent lioness came loping easily along through  the grass. She looked very small at that distance, like a toy, and quite  unhurried. Indeed, every few moments she paused to look back in an  annoyed fashion over her shoulder in the direction of the row behind  her.    There was nothing to do but sit tight and wait. The lioness was headed  exactly to cross our front; nor, except at one point, was she at all  likely to deviate. A shallow tributary ravine ran into our own about two  hundred yards away. She might possibly sneak down the bed of this. It  seemed unlikely. The going was bad, and in addition she had no idea as  yet that she had been sighted. Indeed, the chances were that she would  come to a definite stop before making the crossing, in which case we  would get a shot.    \"And if she does go down the donga,\" whispered Hill, \"the dogs will  locate her.\"    Sitting still while things approach is always exciting. This is true of  ducks; but when you multiply ducks by lions it is still more true. We  all crouched very low in the grass. She leapt without hesitation into  the ravine--and did not emerge.    This was a disappointment. We concluded she must have entered the stream  bottom, and were just about to move when Memba Sasa snapped his fingers.  His sharp eyes had discovered her sneaking along, belly to the ground,  like the cat she was. The explanation of this change in her gait was  simple. Our companions had rounded the corner of the hill and were  galloping in plain view a half-mile away. The lioness had caught sight  of them.    She was gliding by, dimly visible, through thick brush seventy yards  distant. Now I could make out a tawny patch that faded while I looked;  now I could merely guess at a melting shadow.    \"Stir her up,\" whispered Hill. \"Never mind whether you hit. She'll sneak  away.\"    At the shot she leaped fully out into the open with a snarl. Promptly I  planted a Springfield bullet in her ribs. She answered slightly to the  hit, but did not shift position. Her head up, her tail thrashing from  side to side, her ears laid back, she stood there looking the landscape  over carefully point by point. She was searching for us, but as yet  could not locate us. It was really magnificent.    I attempted to throw in another cartridge, but because of my desire to  work the bolt quietly, in order not to attract the lioness's attention,  I did not pull it back far enough, and the cartridge jammed in the  magazine. As evidence of Memba Sasa's coolness and efficiency, it is to  be written that he became aware of this as soon as I did. He thrust  the.405 across my right side, at the same time withdrawing the  Springfield on the left.

But is there one, in all the land,  With my sweet Margy to compare,  A candle to hold to my sister fair?  Bravo! Kling! Klang! it echoed round!  One party cried: 'tis truth he speaks,  She is the jewel of the sex!  And the braggarts all in silence were bound.  And now!--one could pull out his hair with vexation,  And run up the walls for mortification!--  Every two-legged creature that goes in breeches  Can mock me with sneers and stinging speeches!  And I like a guilty debtor sitting,  For fear of each casual word am sweating!  And though I could smash them in my ire,  I dare not call a soul of them liar.

In this game let our Lord God be!  That which is done, alas! is done.  And every thing its course will run.  With one you secretly begin,  Presently more of them come in,  And when a dozen share in thee,  Thou art the whole town's property.    When shame is born to this world of sorrow,  The birth is carefully hid from sight,  And the mysterious veil of night  To cover her head they borrow;  Yes, they would gladly stifle the wearer;  But as she grows and holds herself high,  She walks uncovered in day's broad eye,  Though she has not become a whit fairer.  The uglier her face to sight,  The more she courts the noonday light.    Already I the time can see  When all good souls shall shrink from thee,  Thou prostitute, when thou go'st by them,  As if a tainted corpse were nigh them.  Thy heart within thy breast shall quake then,  When they look thee in the face.  Shalt wear no gold chain more on thy neck then!  Shalt stand no more in the holy place!  No pleasure in point-lace collars take then,  Nor for the dance thy person deck then!  But into some dark corner gliding,  'Mong beggars and cripples wilt be hiding;  And even should God thy sin forgive,  Wilt be curs'd on earth while thou shalt live!    _Martha_. Your soul to the mercy of God surrender!  Will you add to your load the sin of slander?    _Valentine_. Could I get at thy dried-up frame,  Vile bawd, so lost to all sense of shame!  Then might I hope, e'en this side Heaven,  Richly to find my sins forgiven.    _Margery_. My brother! This is hell to me!    _Valentine_. I tell thee, let these weak tears be!
