Three sorts of limestone were employed: for  the best tombs, the fine white limestone of Turah, or the compact siliceous  limestone of Sakkarah; for ordinary tombs, the marly limestone of the  Libyan hills. This last, impregnated with salt and veined with crystalline  gypsum, is a friable material, and unsuited for ornamentation. The bricks  are of two kinds, both being merely sun-dried. The most ancient kind, which  ceased to be used about the time of the Sixth Dynasty, is small (8.7 X 4.3  X 5.5 inches), yellowish, and made of nothing but sand, mixed with a little  clay and grit.    [Illustration: Fig. 113.--A Mastaba.]    The later kind is of mud mixed with straw, black, compact, carefully  moulded, and of a fair size (15.0 X 7.1 X 5.5 inches). The style of the  internal construction differs according to the material employed by the  architect. In nine cases out of ten, the stone mastabas are but outwardly  regular in construction. The core is of roughly quarried rubble, mixed with  rubbish and limestone fragments hastily bedded in layers of mud, or piled  up without any kind of mortar. The brick mastabas are nearly always of  homogeneous construction. The facing bricks are carefully mortared, and the  joints inside are filled up with sand. That the mastaba should be  canonically oriented, the four faces set to the four cardinal points, and  the longer axis laid from north and south, was indispensable; but,  practically, the masons took no special care about finding the true north,  and the orientation of these structures is seldom exact. At Gizeh, the  mastabas are distributed according to a symmetrical plan, and ranged in  regular streets. At Sakkarah, at Abusir, and at Dahshur, they are scattered  irregularly over the surface of the plateau, crowded in some places, and  wide apart in others. The Mussulman cemetery at Siut perpetuates the like  arrangement, and enables us to this day to realise the aspect of the  Memphite necropolis towards the close of the ancient empire.    [Illustration: Fig. 114.--False door in mastaba, from Mariette's _Les  Mastabahs_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 115.--Plan of forecourt of mastaba of Kaapir.]    A flat, unpaved platform, formed by the top course of the core (Note 13),  covers the top of the mass of the mastaba. This platform is scattered over  with terracotta vases, nearly buried in the loose rubbish. These lie  thickly over the hollow interior, but are more sparsely deposited  elsewhere. The walls are bare. The doors face to the eastward side. They  occasionally face towards the north or south side, but never towards the  west. In theory, there should be two doors, one for the dead, the other for  the living. In practice, the entrance for the dead was a mere niche, high  and narrow, cut in the eastward face, near the north-east corner. At the  back of this niche are marked vertical lines, framing in a closed space.  Even this imitation of a door was sometimes omitted, and the soul was left  to manage as best it might. The door of the living was made more or less  important, according to the greater or less development of the chamber to  which it led. The chamber and door are in some cases represented by only a  shallow recess decorated with a stela and a table of offerings (fig. 114).  This is sometimes protected by a wall which projects from the facade, thus  forming a kind of forecourt open to the north. The forecourt is square in  the tomb of Kaapir (fig. 114), and irregular in that of Neferhotep at  Sakkarah (fig. 116). When the plan includes one or more chambers, the door  sometimes opens in the middle of a small architectural facade (fig. 117),  or under a little portico supported by two square pillars without either  base or abacus (fig. 118). The doorway is very simple, the two jambs being  ornamented with bas-reliefs representing the deceased, and surmounted by a  cylindrical drum engraved with his name and titles. In the tomb of Pohunika  at Sakkarah the jambs are two pilasters, each crowned with two lotus  flowers; but this example is, so far, unique.    [Illustration: Fig. 116.--Plan of forecourt, mastaba of Neferhotep.]    [Illustration: Fig. 117.--Door in facade of mastaba.]    [Illustration: Fig. 118.--Portico and door, from Mariette's _Les  Mastabahs_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 119.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of Khabiusokari, Fourth  Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 120.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of Ti, Fifth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 121.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of Shepsesptah, Fourth  Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 122.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of Affi, Sakkarah,  Fourth Dynasty.]    The chapel was usually small, and lost in the mass of the building (fig.  119), but no precise rule determined its size. In the tomb of Ti there is  first a portico (A), then a square ante-chamber with pillars (B), then a  passage (C) with a small room (D) on the right, leading to the last chamber  (E) (fig. 120). There was room enough in this tomb for many persons, and,  in point of fact, the wife of Ti reposed by the side of her husband. When  the monument belonged to only one person, the structure was less  complicated. A short and narrow passage led to an oblong chamber upon which  it opened at right angles, so that the place is in shape of a T (fig. 121).  The end wall is generally smooth; but sometimes it is recessed just  opposite the entrance passage, and then the plan forms a cross, of which  the head is longer or shorter (fig. 122). This was the ordinary  arrangement, but the architect was free to reject it, if he so pleased.  Here, a chapel consists of two parallel lobbies connected by a cross  passage (fig. 123). Elsewhere, the chamber opens from a corner of the  passage (fig. 124). Again, in the tomb of Ptahhotep, the site was hemmed in  by older buildings, and was not large enough. The builders therefore joined  the new mastaba to the older one in such wise as to give them one entrance  in common, and thus the chapel of the one is enlarged by absorbing the  whole of the space occupied by the other (fig. 125).    [Illustration: Fig. 123.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of Thenti II., Fourth  Dynasty, Sakkarah.]    [Illustration: Fig. 124.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of the _Red Scribe_,  Fourth Dynasty, Sakkarah.]    The chapel was the reception room of the Double. It was there that the  relations, friends, and priests celebrated the funerary sacrifices on the  days prescribed by law; that is to say, \"at the feasts of the commencement  of the seasons; at the feast of Thoth on the first day of the year; at the  feast of Uaga; at the great feast of Sothis; on the day of the procession  of the god Min; at the feast of shew-bread; at the feasts of the months and  the half months, and the days of the week.\" Offerings were placed in the  principal room, at the foot of the west wall, at the exact spot leading to  the entrance of the \"eternal home\" of the dead. Unlike the _Kiblah_ of the  mosques, or Mussulman oratories, this point is not always oriented towards  the same quarter of the compass, though often found to the west. In the  earliest times it was indicated by a real door, low and narrow, framed and  decorated like the door of an ordinary house, but not pierced through. An  inscription graven upon the lintel in large readable characters,  commemorated the name and rank of the owner. His portrait, either sitting  or standing, was carved upon the jambs; and a scene, sculptured or painted  on the space above the door, represented him seated before a small round  table, stretching out his hand towards the repast placed upon it. A flat  slab, or offering table, built into the floor between the two uprights of  the doorway, received the votive meats and drinks.    [Illustration: Fig. 125.--Plan of chapel in mastaba of Ptahhotep, Fifth  Dynasty, Sakkarah.]    [Illustration: Fig. 126.--Stela in tomb of Merruka (Fifth Dynasty, Abusir):  a false doorway containing the statue of the deceased.]    The general appearance of the recess is that of a somewhat narrow doorway.  As a rule it was empty, but occasionally it contained a portrait statue of  the dead standing with one foot forward as though about to cross the gloomy  threshold of his tomb, descend the few steps before him, advance into his  reception room or chapel, and pass out into the sunlight (fig. 126). As a  matter of fact, the stela symbolised the door leading to the private  apartments of the dead, a door closed and sealed to the living. It was  inscribed on door-posts and lintels, and its inscription was no mere  epitaph for the information of future generations; all the details which it  gave as to the name, rank, functions, and family of the deceased were  intended to secure the continuity of his individuality and civil status in  the life beyond death. A further and essential object of its inscriptions  was to provide him with food and drink by means of prayers or magic  formulae constraining one of the gods of the dead--Osiris or Anubis--to act  as intermediary between him and his survivors and to set apart for his use  some portion of the provisions offered for his sake in sacrifice to one or  other of these deities. By this agency the _Kas_ or Doubles of these  provisions were supposed to be sent on into the next world to gladden and  satisfy the human _Ka_ indicated to the divine intermediary. Offerings of  real provisions were not indispensable to this end; any chance visitor in  times to come who should simply repeat the formula of the stela aloud would  thereby secure the immediate enjoyment of all the good things enumerated to  the unknown dead whom he evoked.    [Illustration: Fig. 127.--Wall scene of funerary offerings, from mastaba of  Ptahhotep, Fifth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 128.--Wall-painting, funeral voyage; mastaba of Urkhuu,  Gizeh, Fourth Dynasty.]    [Illustr"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1441"],[0,"The Story of an African Farm (#18)"],[1,"a tall, pudgy girl of fifteen, weighing  a hundred and fifty pounds, with baggy pendulous cheeks and up-turned  nose. She strikingly resembled Tant Sannie, in form and feature, but  her sleepy good eyes lacked that twinkle that dwelt in the Boer-woman's  small orbs. She was attired in a bright green print, wore brass rings in  her ears and glass beads round her neck, and was sucking the tip of her  large finger as she looked at the pigs.    \"Who is it that has come?\" asked Bonaparte, when he stood drinking his  coffee in the front room.    \"Why, my niece, to be sure,\" said Tant Sannie, the Hottentot maid  translating. \"She's the only daughter of my only brother Paul, and she's  come to visit me. She'll be a nice mouthful to the man that can get  her,\" added Tant Sannie. \"Her father's got two thousand pounds in the  green wagon box under his bed, and a farm, and five thousand sheep,  and God Almighty knows how many goats and horses. They milk ten cows in  mid-winter, and the young men are after her like flies about a bowl of  milk. She says she means to get married in four months, but she doesn't  yet know to whom. It was so with me when I was young,\" said Tant Sannie.  \"I've sat up with the young men four and five nights a week. And they  will come riding again, as soon as ever they know that the time's up  that the Englishman made me agree not to marry in.\"    The Boer-woman smirked complacently.    \"Where are you going to?\" asked Tant Sannie presently, seeing that  Bonaparte rose.    \"Ha! I'm just going to the kraals; I'll be in to supper,\" said  Bonaparte.    Nevertheless, when he reached his own door he stopped and turned in  there. Soon after he stood before the little glass, arrayed in his best  white shirt with the little tucks, and shaving himself. He had on his  very best trousers, and had heavily oiled the little fringe at the  back of his head, which, however, refused to become darker. But what  distressed him most was his nose--it was very red. He rubbed his finger  and thumb on the wall, and put a little whitewash on it; but, finding  it rather made matters worse, he rubbed it off again. Then he looked  carefully into his own eyes. They certainly were a little pulled down at  the outer corners, which gave them the appearance of looking crosswise;  but then they were a nice blue. So he put on his best coat, took up his  stick, and went out to supper, feeling on the whole well satisfied.    \"Aunt,\" said Trana to Tant Sannie when that night they lay together in  the great wooden bed, \"why does the Englishman sigh so when he looks at  me?\"    \"Ha!\" said Tant Sannie, who was half asleep, but suddenly started, wide  awake. \"It's because he thinks you look like me. I tell you, Trana,\"  said Tant Sannie, \"the man is mad with love of me. I told him the other  night I couldn't marry till Em was sixteen, or I'd lose all the sheep  her father left me. And he talked about Jacob working seven years and  seven years again for his wife. And of course he meant me,\" said Tant  Sannie pompously. \"But he won't get me so easily as he thinks; he'll  have to ask more than once.\"    \"Oh!\" said Trana, who was a lumpish girl and not much given to talking;  but presently she added, \"Aunt, why does the Englishman always knock  against a person when he passes them?\"    \"That's because you are always in the way,\" said Tant Sannie.    \"But, aunt,\" said Trana, presently, \"I think he is very ugly.\"    \"Phugh!\" said Tant Sannie. \"It's only because we're not accustomed to  such noses in this country. In his country he says all the people have  such noses, and the redder your nose is the higher you are. He's of the  family of the Queen Victoria, you know,\" said Tant Sannie, wakening up  with her subject; \"and he doesn't think anything of governors and church  elders and such people; they are nothing to him. When his aunt with  the dropsy dies he'll have money enough to buy all the farms in this  district.\"    \"Oh!\" said Trana. That certainly made a difference.    \"Yes,\" said Tant Sannie; \"and he's only forty-one, though you'd take him  to be sixty. And he told me last night the real reason of his baldness.\"    Tant Sannie then proceeded to relate how, at eighteen years of age,  Bonaparte had courted a fair young lady. How a deadly rival, jealous  of his verdant locks, his golden flowing hair, had, with a damnable  and insinuating deception, made him a present of a pot of pomatum. How,  applying it in the evening, on rising in the morning he found his pillow  strewn with the golden locks, and, looking into the glass, beheld  the shining and smooth expanse which henceforth he must bear. The few  remaining hairs were turned to a silvery whiteness, and the young lady  married his rival.    \"And,\" said Tant Sannie solemnly, \"if it had not been for the grace of  God, and reading of the psalms, he says he would have killed himself. He  says he could kill himself quite easily if he wants to marry a woman and  she won't.\"    \"Alle wereld!\" said Trana: and then they went to sleep.    Every one was lost in sleep soon; but from the window of the cabin the  light streamed forth. It came from a dung fire, over which Waldo sat  brooding. Hour after hour he sat there, now and again throwing a fresh  lump of fuel on to the fire, which burnt up bravely, and then sank into  a great bed of red coals, which reflected themselves in the boy's eyes  as he sat there brooding, brooding, brooding. At last, when the fire was  blazing at its brightest, he rose suddenly and walked slowly to a beam  from which an ox riem hung. Loosening it, he ran a noose in one end and  then doubled it round his arm.    \"Mine, mine! I have a right,\" he muttered; and then something louder,  \"if I fall and am killed, so much the better!\"    He opened the door and went out into the starlight.    He walked with his eyes bent upon the ground, but overhead it was one of  those brilliant southern nights when every space so small that your hand  might cover it shows fifty cold white points, and the Milky-Way is a  belt of sharp frosted silver. He passed the door where Bonaparte lay  dreaming of Trana and her wealth, and he mounted the ladder steps. From  those he clambered with some difficulty on to the roof of the house. It  was of old rotten thatch with a ridge of white plaster, and it crumbled  away under his feet at every step. He trod as heavily as he could. So  much the better if he fell.    He knelt down when he got to the far gable, and began to fasten his riem  to the crumbling bricks. Below was the little window of the loft. With  one end of the riem tied round the gable, the other end round his waist,  how easy to slide down to it, and to open it, through one of the broken  panes, and to go in, and to fill his arms with books, and to clamber up  again! They had burnt one book--he would have twenty. Every man's hand  was against his--his should be against every man's. No one would help  him--he would help himself.    He lifted the black damp hair from his knit forehead, and looked round  to cool his hot face. Then he saw what a regal night it was. He knelt  silently and looked up. A thousand eyes were looking down at him, bright  and so cold. There was a laughing irony in them.    \"So hot, so bitter, so angry? Poor little mortal?\"    He was ashamed. He folded his arms, and sat on the ridge of the roof  looking up at them.    \"So hot, so bitter, so angry?\"    It was as though a cold hand had been laid upon his throbbing forehead,  and slowly they began to fade and grow dim. Tant Sannie and the burnt  book, Bonaparte and the broken machine, the box in the loft, he himself  sitting there--how small they all became! Even the grave over yonder.  Those stars that shone on up above so quietly, they had seen a thousand  such little existences fight just so fiercely, flare up just so brightly  and go out; and they, the old, old stars, shone on forever.    \"So hot, so angry, poor little soul?\" they said.    The riem slipped from his fingers; he sat with his arms folded, looking  up.    \"We,\" said the stars, \"have seen the earth when it was young. We have  seen small things creep out upon its surface--small things that prayed  and loved and cried very loudly, and then crept under it again. But we,\"  said the stars, \"are as old as the Unknown.\"    He leaned his chin against the palm of his hand and looked up at them.  So long he sat there that bright stars set and new ones rose, and yet he  sat on.    Then at last he stood up, and began to loosen the riem from the gable.    What did it matter about the books? The lust and the desire for them had  died out. If they pleased to keep them from him they might. What matter?  it was a very little thing. Why hate, and struggle, and fight? Let it be  as it would.    He twisted the riem round his arm and walked back along the ridge of the  house.    By this time Bonaparte Blenkins had finished his dream of Trana, and as  he turned himself round for a fresh doze he heard the steps descending  the ladder. His first impulse was to draw the blanket over his head and  his legs under him, and to shout; but recollecting that the door was  locked and the window carefully bolted, he allowed his head slowly to  crop out among the blankets, and listened intently. Whosoever it might  be, there was no danger of their getting at him; so he clambered out of  bed, and going on tiptoe to the door, applied his eye to the keyhole.  There was nothing to be seen; so walking to the window, he brought his  face as close to the glass as his nose would allow. There was a figure  just discernible. The lad was not trying to walk softly, and the heavy  shuffling of the well-known velschoens could be clearly heard through  the closed window as they crossed the stones in the yard. Bonaparte  listened till they had died away round the corner of the wagon-house;  and, feeling that his bare legs were getting cold, he jumped back into  bed again.    *****    \"What do you keep"]]]
