Westphal  perceived that this abnormality was congenital, not acquired, so that it  could not be termed vice; and, while he insisted on the presence of  neurotic elements, his observations showed the absence of anything that  could legitimately be termed insanity. He gave to this condition the name  of \"contrary sexual feeling\" (_Kontraere Sexualempfindung_), by which it  was long usually known in Germany. The way was thus made clear for the  rapid progress of our knowledge of this abnormality. New cases were  published in quick succession, at first exclusively in Germany, and more  especially in Westphal's _Archiv_, but soon in other countries also,  chiefly Italy and France.[113]    While Westphal was the first to place the study of sexual inversion on a  progressive footing, many persons had previously obtained glimpses into  the subject. Thus, in 1791, two cases were published[114] of men who  showed a typical emotional attraction to their own sex, though it was not  quite clearly made out that the inversion was congenital. In 1836, again,  a Swiss writer, Heinrich Hoessli, published a rather diffuse but remarkable  work, entitled _Eros_, which contained much material of a literary  character bearing on this matter. He seems to have been moved to write  this book by a trial which had excited considerable attention at that  time. A man of good position had suddenly murdered a youth, and was  executed for the crime, which, according to Hoessli, was due to homosexual  love and jealousy. Hoessli was not a trained scholar; he was in business at  Glarus as a skillful milliner, the most successful in the town. His own  temperament is supposed to have been bisexual. His book was prohibited by  the local authorities and at a later period the entire remaining stock was  destroyed in a fire, so that its circulation was very small. It is now,  however, regarded by some as the first serious attempt to deal with the  problem of homosexuality since Plato's _Banquet_.[115]    Some years later, in 1852, Casper, the chief medico-legal authority of his  time in Germany,--for it is in Germany that the foundations of the study  of sexual inversion have been laid,--pointed out in Casper's  _Vierteljahrsschrift_ that pederasty, in a broad sense of the word, was  sometimes a kind of \"moral hermaphroditism,\" due to a congenital psychic  condition, and also that it by no means necessarily involved sodomy  (_immissio penis in anum_). Casper brought forward a considerable amount  of valuable evidence concerning these cardinal points, which he was the  first to note,[116] but he failed to realize the full significance of his  observations, and they had no immediate influence, though Tardieu, in  1858, admitted a congenital element in some pederasts.    The man, however, who more than anyone else brought to light the phenomena  of sexual inversion had not been concerned either with the medical or the  criminal aspects of the matter. Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (born in 1825 near  Aurich), who for many years expounded and defended homosexual love, and  whose views are said to have had some influence in drawing Westphal's  attention to the matter, was a Hanoverian legal official (_Amtsassessor_),  himself sexually inverted. From 1864 onward, at first under the name of  \"Numa Numantius\" and subsequently under his own name, Ulrichs published,  in various parts of Germany, a long series of works dealing with this  question, and made various attempts to obtain a revision of the legal  position of the sexual invert in Germany.    Although not a writer whose psychological views can carry much scientific  weight, Ulrichs appears to have been a man of most brilliant ability, and  his knowledge is said to have been of almost universal extent; he was not  only well versed in his own special subjects of jurisprudence and  theology, but in many branches of natural science, as well as in  archeology; he was also regarded by many as the best Latinist of his time.  In 1880 he left Germany and settled in Naples, and afterward at Aquila in  the Abruzzi, whence he issued a Latin periodical. He died in 1895.[117]  John Addington Symonds, who went to Aquila in 1891, wrote: \"Ulrichs is  _chrysostomos_ to the last degree, sweet, noble, a true gentleman and man  of genius. He must have been at one time a man of singular personal  distinction, so finely cut are his features, and so grand the lines of his  skull.\"[118]    For many years Ulrichs was alone in his efforts to gain scientific  recognition for congenital homosexuality. He devised (with allusion to  Uranos in Plato's _Symposium_) the word uranian or urning, ever since  frequently used for the homosexual lover, while he called the normal  heterosexual lover a dioning (from Dione). He regarded uranism, or  homosexual love, as a congenital abnormality by which a female soul had  become united with a male body--_anima muliebris in corpore virili  inclusa_--and his theoretical speculations have formed the starting point  for many similar speculations. His writings are remarkable in various  respects, although, on account of the polemical warmth with which, as one  pleading _pro domo_, he argued his cause, they had no marked influence on  scientific thought.[119]    This privilege was reserved for Westphal. After he had shown the way and  thrown open his journal for their publication, new cases appeared in rapid  succession. In Italy, also, Ritti, Tamassia, Lombroso, and others began to  study these phenomena. In 1882 Charcot and Magnan published in the  _Archives de Neurologie_ the first important study which appeared in  France concerning sexual inversion and allied sexual perversions. They  regarded sexual inversion as an episode (_syndrome_) in a more fundamental  process of hereditary degeneration, and compared it with such morbid  obsessions as dipsomania and kleptomania. From a somewhat more  medico-legal standpoint, the study of sexual inversion in France was  furthered by Brouardel, and still more by Lacassagne, whose stimulating  influence at Lyons has produced fruitful results in the work of many  pupils.[120]    Of much more importance in the history of the theory of sexual inversion  was the work of Richard von Krafft-Ebing (born at Mannheim in 1840 and  died at Graz in 1902), for many years professor of psychiatry at Vienna  University and one of the most distinguished alienists of his time. While  active in all departments of psychiatry and author of a famous textbook,  from 1877 onward he took special interest in the pathology of the sexual  impulse. His _Psychopathia Sexualis_ contained over two hundred histories,  not only of sexual inversion but of all other forms of sexual perversion.  For many years it was the only book on the subject and it long remained  the chief storehouse of facts. It passed through many editions and was  translated into many languages (there are two translations in English),  enjoying an immense and not altogether enviable vogue.    Krafft-Ebing's methods were open to some objection. His mind was not of a  severely critical order. He poured out the new and ever-enlarged editions  of his book with extraordinary rapidity, sometimes remodelling them. He  introduced new subdivisions from time to time into his classification of  sexual perversions, and, although this rather fine-spun classification has  doubtless contributed to give precision to the subject and to advance its  scientific study, it was at no time generally accepted. Krafft-Ebing's  great service lay in the clinical enthusiasm with which he approached the  study of sexual perversions. With the firm conviction that he was  conquering a great neglected field of morbid psychology which rightly  belongs to the physician, he accumulated without any false shame a vast  mass of detailed histories, and his reputation induced sexually abnormal  individuals in all directions to send him their autobiographies, in the  desire to benefit their fellow-sufferers.    It is as a clinician, rather than as a psychologist, that we must regard  Krafft-Ebing. At the outset he considered inversion to be a functional  sign of degeneration, a partial manifestation of a neuropathic and  psychopathic state which is in most cases hereditary. This perverse  sexuality appears spontaneously with the developing sexual life, without  external causes, as the individual manifestation of an abnormal  modification of the _vita sexualis_, and must then be regarded as  congenital; or it develops as a result of special injurious influences  working on a sexuality which had at first been normal, and must then be  regarded as acquired. Careful investigation of these so-called acquired  cases, however, Krafft-Ebing in the end finally believed, would indicate  that the predisposition consists in a latent homosexuality, or at least  bisexuality, which requires for its manifestation the operation of  accidental causes. In the last edition of his work Krafft-Ebing was  inclined to regard inversion as being not so much a degeneration as a  variation, a simple anomaly, and acknowledged that his opinion thus  approximated to that which had long been held by inverts themselves.[121]    At the time of his death, Krafft-Ebing, who had begun by accepting the  view, at that time prevalent among alienists, that homosexuality is a sign  of degeneration, thus fully adopted and set the seal of his authority on  the view, already expressed alike by some scientific investigators as well  as by inverts themselves, that sexual inversion is to be regarded simply  as an anomaly, whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the  value of the anomaly. The way was even opened for such a view as that of  Freud and most of the psychoanalysts today who regard a strain of  homosexuality as normal and almost constant, with a profound significance  for the psychonervous life.

The second  process has the object, directly, of discharging the tension thus produced  and, indirectly, of effecting the act by which the race is propagated.    It seems to me that this is at present the most satisfactory way in which  we can attempt to define the sexual impulse.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] C.

For a discussion at the Neurology Section  of the British Medical Association Meeting, 1912, see _British Medical  Journal_, Nov. 16, 1912.    [17] Since this was written I have come across a passage in _Hampa_ (p.  228), by Rafael Salillas, the Spanish sociologist, which shows that the  analogy has been detected by the popular mind and been embodied in popular  language: \"A significant anatomico-physiological concordance supposes a  resemblance between the mouth and the sexual organs of a woman, between  coitus and the ingestion of food, and between foods which do not require  mastication and the spermatic ejaculation; these representations find  expression in the popular name _papo_ given to women's genital organs.  'Papo' is the crop of birds, and is derived from 'papar' (Latin,  _papare_), to eat soft food such as we call pap. With this representation  of infantile food is connected the term _leche_ [milk] as applied to the  ejaculated genital fluid.\" Cleland, it may be added, in the most  remarkable of English erotic novels, _The Memoirs of Fanny Hill_, refers  to \"the compressive exsuction with which the sensitive mechanism of that  part [the vagina] thirstily draws and drains the nipple of Love,\" and  proceeds to compare it to the action of the child at the breast. It  appears that, in some parts of the animal world at least, there is a real  analogy of formation between the oral and vaginal ends of the trunk. This  is notably the case in some insects, and the point has been elaborately  discussed by Walter Wesche, \"The Genitalia of Both the Sexes in Diptera,  and their Relation to the Armature of the Mouth,\" _Transactions of the  Linnean Society_, second series, vol. ix, Zooelogy, 1906.    [18] Naecke now expresses himself very dubiously on the point; see, e.g.,  _Archiv fuer Kriminal-Anthropologie_, 1905, p. 186.    [19] _Untersuchungen ueber die Libido Sexualis_, Berlin, 1897-98.    [20] Moll adopts the term \"impulse of detumescence\" (_Detumescenztrieb_)  instead of \"impulse of ejaculation,\" because in women there is either no  ejaculation or it cannot be regarded as essential.    [21] I quote from the second edition, as issued in 1881.    [22] This is the theory which by many has alone been seen in Darwin's  _Descent of Man_. Thus even his friend Wallace states unconditionally  (_Tropical Nature_, p. 193) that Darwin accepted a \"voluntary or conscious  sexual selection,\" and seems to repeat the same statement in _Darwinism_  (1889), p. 283. Lloyd Morgan, in his discussion of the pairing instinct in  _Habit and Instinct_ (1896), seems also only to see this side of Darwin's  statement.    [23] In his _Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_, Darwin  was puzzled by the fact that, in captivity, animals often copulate without  conceiving and failed to connect that fact with the processes behind his  own theory of sexual selection.    [24] Beaunis, _Sensations Internes_, ch. v, \"Besoins Sexuels,\" 1889. It  may be noted that many years earlier Burdach (in his _Physiologie als  Erfahrungswissenschaft_, 1826) had recognized that the activity of the  male favored procreation, and that mental and physical excitement seemed  to have the same effect in the female also.    [25] It is scarcely necessary to point out that this is too extreme a  position. As J.G. Millais remarks of ducks (_Natural History of British  Ducks_, p. 45), in courtship \"success in winning the admiration of the  female is rather a matter of persistent and active attention than physical  force,\" though the males occasionally fight over the female. The ruff  (_Machetes pugnax_) is a pugnacious bird, as his name indicates. Yet, the  reeve, the female of this species, is, as E. Selous shows (\"Sexual  Selection in Birds,\" _Zooelogist_, Feb. and May, 1907), completely mistress  of the situation. \"She seems the plain and unconcerned little mistress of  a numerous and handsome seraglio, each member of which, however he flounce  and bounce, can only wait to be chosen.\" Any fighting among the males is  only incidental and is not a factor in selection. Moreover, as R. Mueller  points out (loc. cit., p. 290), fighting would not usually attain the end  desired, for if the males expend their time and strength in a serious  combat they merely afford a third less pugnacious male a better  opportunity of running off with the prize.    [26] L. Tillier, _L'Instinct Sexuel_, 1889, pp. 74, 118, 119, 124 et seq.,  289.    [27] K. Groos, _Die Spiele der Thiere_, 1896; _Die Spiele der Menschen_,  1899; both are translated into English.    [28] Prof. H.E. Ziegler, in a private letter to Professor Groos, _Spiele  der Thiere_, p. 202.    [29] _Die Spiele der Thiere_, p. 244. This had been briefly pointed out by  earlier writers. Thus, Haeckel (_Gen. Morph._, ii, p. 244) remarked that  fighting for females is a special or modified kind of struggle for  existence, and that it acts on both sexes.    [30] It may be added that in the human species, as Bray remarks (\"Le Beau  dans la Nature,\" _Revue Philosophique_, October, 1901, p. 403), \"the hymen  would seem to tend to the same end, as if nature had wished to reinforce  by a natural obstacle the moral restraint of modesty, so that only the  vigorous male could insure his reproduction.\" There can be no doubt that  among many animals pairing is delayed so far as possible until maturity is  reached. \"It is a strict rule amongst birds,\" remarks J.G. Millais (op.  cit., p. 46), \"that they do not breed until both sexes have attained the  perfect adult plumage.\" Until that happens, it seems probable, the  conditions for sexual excitation are not fully established. We know  little, says Howard (_Zooelogist_, 1903, p. 407), of the age at which birds  begin to breed, but it is known that \"there are yearly great numbers of  individuals who do not breed, and the evidence seems to show that such  individuals are immature.\"    [31] A.
