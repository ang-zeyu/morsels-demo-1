It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is  possible.\"    \"How do you know that, sir?\" asked Summerlee, sharply.    \"Because my predecessor, the American Maple White, actually made such  an ascent.  How otherwise could he have seen the monster which he  sketched in his notebook?\"    \"There you reason somewhat ahead of the proved facts,\" said the  stubborn Summerlee.  \"I admit your plateau, because I have seen it; but  I have not as yet satisfied myself that it contains any form of life  whatever.\"    \"What you admit, sir, or what you do not admit, is really of  inconceivably small importance.  I am glad to perceive that the plateau  itself has actually obtruded itself upon your intelligence.\" He glanced  up at it, and then, to our amazement, he sprang from his rock, and,  seizing Summerlee by the neck, he tilted his face into the air.  \"Now  sir!\" he shouted, hoarse with excitement.  \"Do I help you to realize  that the plateau contains some animal life?\"    I have said that a thick fringe of green overhung the edge of the  cliff.  Out of this there had emerged a black, glistening object.  As  it came slowly forth and overhung the chasm, we saw that it was a very  large snake with a peculiar flat, spade-like head.  It wavered and  quivered above us for a minute, the morning sun gleaming upon its  sleek, sinuous coils.  Then it slowly drew inwards and disappeared.    Summerlee had been so interested that he had stood unresisting while  Challenger tilted his head into the air.  Now he shook his colleague  off and came back to his dignity.    \"I should be glad, Professor Challenger,\" said he, \"if you could see  your way to make any remarks which may occur to you without seizing me  by the chin.  Even the appearance of a very ordinary rock python does  not appear to justify such a liberty.\"    \"But there is life upon the plateau all the same,\" his colleague  replied in triumph.  \"And now, having demonstrated this important  conclusion so that it is clear to anyone, however prejudiced or obtuse,  I am of opinion that we cannot do better than break up our camp and  travel to westward until we find some means of ascent.\"    The ground at the foot of the cliff was rocky and broken so that the  going was slow and difficult.  Suddenly we came, however, upon  something which cheered our hearts.  It was the site of an old  encampment, with several empty Chicago meat tins, a bottle labeled  \"Brandy,\" a broken tin-opener, and a quantity of other travelers'  debris.  A crumpled, disintegrated newspaper revealed itself as the  Chicago Democrat, though the date had been obliterated.    \"Not mine,\" said Challenger.  \"It must be Maple White's.\"    Lord John had been gazing curiously at a great tree-fern which  overshadowed the encampment.  \"I say, look at this,\" said he.  \"I  believe it is meant for a sign-post.\"    A slip of hard wood had been nailed to the tree in such a way as to  point to the westward.    \"Most certainly a sign-post,\" said Challenger.  \"What else?  Finding  himself upon a dangerous errand, our pioneer has left this sign so that  any party which follows him may know the way he has taken.  Perhaps we  shall come upon some other indications as we proceed.\"    We did indeed, but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature.  Immediately beneath the cliff there grew a considerable patch of high  bamboo, like that which we had traversed in our journey.  Many of these  stems were twenty feet high, with sharp, strong tops, so that even as  they stood they made formidable spears.  We were passing along the edge  of this cover when my eye was caught by the gleam of something white  within it.  Thrusting in my head between the stems, I found myself  gazing at a fleshless skull.  The whole skeleton was there, but the  skull had detached itself and lay some feet nearer to the open.    With a few blows from the machetes of our Indians we cleared the spot  and were able to study the details of this old tragedy.  Only a few  shreds of clothes could still be distinguished, but there were the  remains of boots upon the bony feet, and it was very clear that the  dead man was a European.  A gold watch by Hudson, of New York, and a  chain which held a stylographic pen, lay among the bones.  There was  also a silver cigarette-case, with \"J. C., from A. E. S.,\" upon the  lid.  The state of the metal seemed to show that the catastrophe had  occurred no great time before.    \"Who can he be?\" asked Lord John.  \"Poor devil! every bone in his body  seems to be broken.\"    \"And the bamboo grows through his smashed ribs,\" said Summerlee.  \"It  is a fast-growing plant, but it is surely inconceivable that this body  could have been here while the canes grew to be twenty feet in length.\"    \"As to the man's identity,\" said Professor Challenger, \"I have no doubt  whatever upon that point.  As I made my way up the river before I  reached you at the fazenda I instituted very particular inquiries about  Maple White.  At Para they knew nothing.  Fortunately, I had a definite  clew, for there was a particular picture in his sketch-book which  showed him taking lunch with a certain ecclesiastic at Rosario.  This  priest I was able to find, and though he proved a very argumentative  fellow, who took it absurdly amiss that I should point out to him the  corrosive effect which modern science must have upon his beliefs, he  none the less gave me some positive information.  Maple White passed  Rosario four years ago, or two years before I saw his dead body.  He  was not alone at the time, but there was a friend, an American named  James Colver, who remained in the boat and did not meet this  ecclesiastic.  I think, therefore, that there can be no doubt that we  are now looking upon the remains of this James Colver.\"    \"Nor,\" said Lord John, \"is there much doubt as to how he met his death.  He has fallen or been chucked from the top, and so been impaled.  How  else could he come by his broken bones, and how could he have been  stuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads?\"    A hush came over us as we stood round these shattered remains and  realized the truth of Lord John Roxton's words.  The beetling head of  the cliff projected over the cane-brake.  Undoubtedly he had fallen  from above.  But had he fallen?  Had it been an accident?  Or--already  ominous and terrible possibilities began to form round that unknown  land.    We moved off in silence, and continued to coast round the line of  cliffs, which were as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous  Antarctic ice-fields which I have seen depicted as stretching from  horizon to horizon and towering high above the mast-heads of the  exploring vessel.    In five miles we saw no rift or break.  And then suddenly we perceived  something which filled us with new hope.  In a hollow of the rock,  protected from rain, there was drawn a rough arrow in chalk, pointing  still to the westwards.    \"Maple White again,\" said Professor Challenger.  \"He had some  presentiment that worthy footsteps would follow close behind him.\"    \"He had chalk, then?\"    \"A box of colored chalks was among the effects I found in his knapsack.  I remember that the white one was worn to a stump.\"    \"That is certainly good evidence,\" said Summerlee.  \"We can only accept  his guidance and follow on to the westward.\"    We had proceeded some five more miles when again we saw a white arrow  upon the rocks.  It was at a point where the face of the cliff was for  the first time split into a narrow cleft.  Inside the cleft was a  second guidance mark, which pointed right up it with the tip somewhat  elevated, as if the spot indicated were above the level of the ground.    It was a solemn place, for the walls were so gigantic and the slit of  blue sky so narrow and so obscured by a double fringe of verdure, that  only a dim and shadowy light penetrated to the bottom.  We had had no  food for many hours, and were very weary with the stony and irregular  journey, but our nerves were too strung to allow us to halt.  We  ordered the camp to be pitched, however, and, leaving the Indians to  arrange it, we four, with the two half-breeds, proceeded up the narrow  gorge.    It was not more than forty feet across at the mouth, but it rapidly  closed until it ended in an acute angle, too straight and smooth for an  ascent.  Certainly it was not this which our pioneer had attempted to  indicate.  We made our way back--the whole gorge was not more than a  quarter of a mile deep--and then suddenly the quick eyes of Lord John  fell upon what we were seeking.  High up above our heads, amid the dark  shadows, there was one circle of deeper gloom.  Surely it could only be  the opening of a cave.    The base of the cliff was heaped with loose stones at the spot, and it  was not difficult to clamber up.  When we reached it, all doubt was  removed.  Not only was it an opening into the rock, but on the side of  it there was marked once again the sign of the arrow.  Here was the  point, and this the means by which Maple White and his ill-fated  comrade had made their ascent.    We were too excited to return to the camp, but must make our first  exploration at once.  Lord John had an electric torch in his knapsack,  and this had to serve us as light.  He advanced, throwing his little  clear circlet of yellow radiance before him, while in single file we  followed at his heels.    The cave had evidently been water-worn, the sides being smooth and the  floor covered with rounded stones.  It was of such a size that a single  man could just fit through by stooping.  For fifty yards it ran almost  straight into the rock, and then it ascended at an angle of forty-five.  Presently this incline became even steeper, and we found ourselves  climbing upon hands and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1,"on the lone white tepee that shone in  the plain. Four races were assembled to look on--the mess Chinaman, two  black laundresses, all the whites in the place (on horse and foot, some  with their hats left behind), and several hundred Indians in blankets.  Duane had a thought to go away and leave this galling farce under the  eye of Starr for the officers were at hand also. But his second thought  bade him remain; and looking at Augustus and the howitzer, his laugh  would have returned to him; but his heart was sore for Casey.    It was an hour of strategy and cannonade, a humiliating hour, which Fort  Brown tells of to this day; and the tepee lived through it all. For it  stood upon fifteen slender poles, not speedily to be chopped down by  shooting lead from afar. When low bullets drilled the canvas, the chief  suggested to Augustus that Ute Jack had climbed up; and when the bullets  flew high, then Ute Jack was doubtless in a hole. Nor did Augustus  contrive to drop a shell from the howitzer upon Ute Jack and explode  him--a shrewd and deadly conception; the shells went beyond, except one,  that ripped through the canvas, somewhat near the ground; and Augustus,  dripping, turned at length, and saying, \"It won't go down,\" stood  vacantly wiping his white face. Then the two chiefs got his leave to  stretch a rope between their horses and ride hard against the tepee. It  was military neither in essence nor to see, but it prevailed. The tepee  sank, a huge umbrella wreck along the earth, and there lay Ute Jack  across the fire's slight hollow, his knee-cap gone with the howitzer  shell. But no blood had flown from that; blood will not run, you know,  when a man has been dead some time. One single other shot had struck  him--one through his own heart. It had singed the flesh.    \"You see, Mr. Albumblatt,\" said Duane, in the whole crowd's hearing,  \"he killed himself directly after killing Casey. A very rare act for  an Indian, as you are doubtless aware. But if your manoeuvres with his  corpse have taught you anything you did not know before, we shall all be  gainers.\"    \"Captain,\" said Mrs. Starr, on a later day, \"you and Ute Jack have ended  our fun. Since the Court of Inquiry let Mr. Albumblatt off, he has not  said Germany once--and that's three months to-morrow.\"          Twenty Minutes for Refreshments      Upon turning over again my diary of that excursion to the Pacific, I  find that I set out from Atlantic waters on the 30th day of a backward  and forlorn April, which had come and done nothing towards making its  share of spring, but had gone, missing its chance, leaving the trees as  bare as it had received them from the winds of March. It was not bleak  weather alone, but care, that I sought to escape by a change of sky;  and I hoped for some fellow-traveller who might begin to interest my  thoughts at once. No such person met me in the several Pullmans which  I inhabited from that afternoon until the forenoon of the following  Friday. Through that long distance, though I had slanted southwestward  across a multitude of States and vegetations, and the Mississippi lay  eleven hundred miles to my rear, the single event is my purchasing  some cat's-eyes of the news-agent at Sierra Blanca. Save this, my diary  contains only neat additions of daily expenses, and moral reflections  of a delicate and restrained melancholy. They were Pecos cat's-eyes, he  told me, obtained in the rocky canyons of that stream, and destined to  be worth little until fashion turned from foreign jewels to become aware  of these fine native stones. And I, glad to possess the jewels of my  country, chose two bracelets and a necklace of them, paying but twenty  dollars for fifteen or sixteen cat's-eyes, and resolved to give them  a setting worthy of their beauty. The diary continues with moral  reflections upon the servility of our taste before anything European,  and the handwriting is clear and deliberate. It abruptly becomes  hurried, and at length well-nigh illegible. It is best, I think,  that you should have this portion as it comes, unpolished, unamended,  unarranged--hot, so to speak, from my immediate pencil, instead of cold  from my subsequent pen. I shall disguise certain names, but that is all.    Friday forenoon, May 5.--I don't have to gaze at my cat's-eyes to kill  time any more. I'm not the only passenger any more. There's a lady.  She got in at El Paso. She has taken the drawing-room, but sits outside  reading newspaper cuttings and writing letters. She is sixty, I should  say, and has a cap and one gray curl. This comes down over her left ear  as far as a purple ribbon which suspends a medallion at her throat. She  came in wearing a sage-green duster of pongee silk, pretty nice, only  the buttons are as big as those largest mint-drops. \"You porter,\" she  said, \"brush this.\" He put down her many things and received it. Her  dress was sage green, and pretty nice too. \"You porter,\" said she, \"open  every window. Why, they are, I declare! What's the thermometer in this  car?\" \"Ninety-five, ma'am. Folks mostly travelling--\" \"That will do,  porter. Now you go make me a pitcher of lemonade right quick.\" She went  into the state-room and shut the door. When she came out she was dressed  in what appeared to be chintz bedroom curtains. They hang and flow  loosely about her, and are covered with a pattern of pink peonies. She  has slippers--Turkish--that stare up in the air, pretty handsome and  comfortable. But I never before saw any one travel with fly-paper. It  must be hard to pack. But it's quite an idea in this train. Fully a  dozen flies have stuck to it already; and she reads her clippings,  and writes away, and sips another glass of lemonade, all with the most  extreme appearance of leisure, not to say sloth. I can't imagine how she  manages to produce this atmosphere of indolence when in reality she is  steadily occupied. Possibly the way she sits. But I think it's partly  the bedroom curtains.    These notes were interrupted by the entrance of the new conductor.  \"If you folks have chartered a private car, just say so,\" he shouted  instantly at the sight of us. He stood still at the extreme end and  removed his hat, which was acknowledged by the lady. \"Travel is surely  very light, Gadsden,\" she assented, and went on with her writing. But  he remained standing still, and shouting like an orator: \"Sprinkle the  floor of this car, Julius, and let the pore passengers get a breath of  cool. My lands!\" He fanned himself sweepingly with his hat. He seemed  but little larger than a red squirrel, and precisely that color. Sorrel  hair, sorrel eyebrows, sorrel freckles, light sorrel mustache, thin  aggressive nose, receding chin, and black, attentive, prominent eyes.  He approached, and I gave him my ticket, which is as long as a neck-tie,  and has my height, the color of my eyes and hair, and my general  description, punched in the margin. \"Why, you ain't middle-aged!\"  he shouted, and a singular croak sounded behind me. But the lady was  writing. \"I have been growing younger since I bought that ticket,\" I  explained. \"That's it, that's it,\" he sang; \"a man's always as old as he  feels, and a woman--is ever young,\" he finished. \"I see you are true to  the old teachings and the old-time chivalry, Gadsden,\" said the lady,  continuously busy. \"Yes, ma'am. Jacob served seven years for Leah and  seven more for Rachel.\" \"Such men are raised today in every worthy  Louisiana home, Gadsden, be it ever so humble.\" \"Yes, ma'am. Give a  fresh sprinkle to the floor, Julius, soon as it goes to get dry. Excuse  me, but do you shave yourself, sir?\" I told him that I did, but without  excusing him. \"You will see that I have a reason for asking,\" he  consequently pursued, and took out of his coat-tails a round tin box  handsomely labelled \"Nat. Fly Paper Co.,\" so that I supposed it was  thus, of course, that the lady came by her fly-paper. But this was pure  coincidence, and the conductor explained: \"That company's me and a man  at Shreveport, but he dissatisfies me right frequently. You know what  heaven a good razor is for a man, and what you feel about a bad one.  Vaseline and ground shells,\" he said, opening the box, \"and I'm not  saying anything except it will last your lifetime and never hardens. Rub  the size of a pea on the fine side of your strop, spread it to an inch  with your thumb. May I beg a favor on so short a meeting? Join me in  the gentlemen's lavatory with your razorstrop in five minutes. I have  to attend to a corpse in the baggage-car, and will return at once.\"  \"Anybody's corpse I know, Gadsden?\" said the lady. \"No, ma'am. Just a  corpse.\"    When I joined him, for I was now willing to do anything, he was  apologetic again. \"'Tis a short acquaintance,\" he said, \"but may I also  beg your razor? Quick as I get out of the National Fly I am going to  register my new label. First there will be Uncle Sam embracing the  world, signifying this mixture is universal, then my name, then the  word Stropine, which is a novelty and carries copyright, and I shall  win comfort and doubtless luxury. The post barber at Fort Bayard took a  dozen off me at sight to retail to the niggers of the Twenty-fourth, and  as he did not happen to have the requisite cash on his person I charged  him two roosters and fifty cents, and both of us done well. He's after  more Stropine, and I got Pullman prices for my roosters, the buffet-car  being out of chicken a la Marengo. There is your razor, sir, and I  appreciate your courtesy.\" It was beautifully sharpened, and I bought  a box of the Stropine and asked him who the lady was. \"Mrs. Porcher  Brewton!\" he exclaimed. \"Have you never met her socially? Why she--why  she is the most intellectual lady in Bee Bayou.\" \"Indeed!\" I said. \"Why  she visits New Orleans, and Charleston, and all the principal centres of  refinement, and is welcomed in Washington. She converses freely with our  statesmen and "]]]
