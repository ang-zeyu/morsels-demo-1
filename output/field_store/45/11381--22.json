Industry is  concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although  the government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region  of Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import essential raw  materials, making its economy closely dependent on the state of world  markets. In 1988 over 70% of trade was with other EC countries. During the  period 1986-88 the economy profited from falling oil prices and a lower  dollar, which helped to improve the terms of trade. Real GDP grew  by an average of 3.5% in 1986-89, up from 1.5% in 1985. However, a  large budget deficit and 10% unemployment cast a shadow on the  economy.    GDP: $136.0 billion, per capita $13,700; real growth rate 4.5%  (1989 est.)    Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3.6% (1989 est.)    Unemployment rate: 9.7% est. (1989 est.)

But in due time he became the proprietor of a horse, which he  fed and groomed himself, and to which he was very much attached. On this  animal he would set out from home, to be gone for weeks together, with  no baggage but a pair of saddle-bags containing a change of linen, and  an old cotton umbrella to shelter him from sun or rain. When he got a  little more of this world's goods he set up a one-horse buggy, a very  sorry and shabby-looking affair which he generally used when the weather  promised to be bad. The other lawyers were always glad to see him, and  landlords hailed his coming with pleasure; but he was one of those  gentle, uncomplaining men whom they would put off with indifferent  accommodations. It was a significant remark of a lawyer who was  thoroughly acquainted with his habits and disposition that \"Lincoln was  never seated next the landlord at a crowded table, and never got a  chicken-liver or the best cut from the roast.\" Lincoln once remarked to  Mr. Gillespie that he never felt his own unworthiness so much as when in  the presence of a hotel clerk or waiter. If rooms were scarce, and one,  two, three, or four gentlemen were required to lodge together in order  to accommodate some surly man who \"stood upon his rights,\" Lincoln was  sure to be one of the unfortunates. Yet he loved the life of the  circuit, and never went home without reluctance.    In describing the many experiences of the lawyers who travelled the  circuits at this period, Mr. Arnold says: \"The State was settled with a  hardy, fearless, honest, but very litigious population. The court-house  was sometimes framed and boarded, but more frequently it was built of  logs. The judge sat upon a raised platform behind a rough board,  sometimes covered with green baize, for a table on which to write his  notes. A small table stood on the floor in front for the clerk. In the  center of the room was another larger table around which in rude chairs  the lawyers were grouped, too often with their feet on top of it. Rough  benches were placed there for the jury, the parties to the suit,  witnesses and bystanders. The court-rooms were nearly always crowded for  here were rehearsed and acted the dramas, the tragedies, and the  comedies of real life. The court-house has always been a very attractive  place to the people of the frontier. It supplied the place of theatres,  lecture and concert rooms, and other places of interest and amusement in  the older settlements and towns. The leading lawyers and judges were the  star actors, and had each his partisans. Hence crowds attended the  courts to see the judges, to hear the lawyers contend, with argument and  law and wit, for success, victory, and fame. The merits and ability of  the leading advocates, their success or discomfiture in examining or  cross-examining a witness, the ability of this or that one to obtain a  verdict, were canvassed at every cabin-raising, bee, or horse-race, and  at every log-house and school in the county. Thus the lawyers were  stimulated to the utmost exertion of their powers, not only by  controversy and desire of success, but by the consciousness that their  efforts were watched with eagerness by friends, clients, partisans, or  rivals. From one to another of these rude court-houses the gentlemen of  the bar passed, following the judge around his circuits from county to  county, travelling generally on horseback, with saddle-bags, brushes, an  extra shirt or two, and perhaps two or three law books. Sometimes two or  three lawyers would unite and travel in a buggy, and the poorer and  younger ones not seldom walked. But a horse was not an unusual fee, and  in those days when horse thieves as clients were but too common, it was  not long before a young man of ability found himself well mounted.    \"There was very great freedom in social intercourse. Manners were rude,  but genial, kind, and friendly. Each was always ready to assist his  fellows, and selfishness was not tolerated. The relations between the  bench and bar were familiar, free and easy. Flashes of wit and humor and  repartee were constantly exchanged. Such was the life upon which Lincoln  now entered; and there gathered with him around those pine tables of the  frontier court-house a very remarkable combination of men, men who  would have been leaders of the bar at Boston or New York, Philadelphia  or Washington; men who would have made their mark in Westminster Hall,  or upon any English circuit. At the capital were John T. Stuart, Stephen  T. Logan, Edward D. Baker, Ninian W. Edwards, Josiah Lamborn, and many  others. Among the leading lawyers from other parts of the State who  practiced in the Supreme and Federal Courts at the capital were Stephen  A. Douglas; Lyman Trumbull, for many years chairman of the judiciary  committee of the United States Senate; O.H. Browning, Senator and member  of the Cabinet at Washington; William H. Bissell, Member of Congress,  and Governor of the State; David Davis, justice of the Supreme Court,  Senator and Vice-President of the United States; Justin Butterfield of  Chicago, and many others almost or quite equally distinguished. This  'circuit riding' involved all sorts of adventures. Hard fare at  miserable country taverns, sleeping on the floor, and fording streams,  were every-day occurrences. All such occurrences were met with good  humor and often turned into sources of frolic and fun. In fording  swollen streams, Lincoln was frequently sent forward as a scout or  pioneer. His extremely long legs enabled him, by taking off his boots  and stockings, and by rolling up or otherwise disposing of his trousers,  to test the depth of the stream, find the most shallow water, and thus  to pilot the party through the current without wetting his garments.\"    A gentleman who lived in one of the judicial circuits of Illinois in  which Lincoln had an extensive though not very lucrative practice gives  some graphic and interesting reminiscences. \"The terms of the court were  held quarterly and usually lasted about two weeks. They were always  seasons of great importance and much gayety in the little town that had  the honor of being the county seat. Distinguished members of the bar  from surrounding and even from distant counties, ex-judges and  ex-Members of Congress, attended and were personally and many of them  popularly known to almost every adult, male and female, of the limited  population. They came in by stages and on horseback. Among them the one  whose arrival was looked forward to with the most pleasurable  anticipations, and whose possible absence--although he almost never was  absent--was feared with the liveliest emotions of anxiety, was 'Uncle  Abe,' as he was lovingly called by us all. Sometimes he might happen to  be a day or two late. Then, as the Bloomington stage came in at sundown,  the bench and bar, jurors and citizens, would gather in crowds at the  hotel where he always put up, to give him a welcome if, happily, he  should arrive, and to experience the keenest feelings of disappointment  if he should not. If he arrived, as he alighted and stretched out both  his long arms to shake hands with those nearest to him and with those  who approached, his homely face handsome in its broad and sunshiny  smile, his voice touching in its kindly and cheerful accents, everyone  in his presence felt lighter in heart and more joyous. He brought light  with him. He loved his fellow-men with all the strength of his great  nature, and those who came in contact with him could not help  reciprocating the love.\"    Another old friend describes Lincoln as being at this time \"very plain  in his costume, as well as rather uncourtly in his address and general  appearance. His clothing was of home Kentucky jean, and the first  impression made by his tall, lank figure upon those who saw him was not  specially prepossessing. He had not outgrown his hard backwoods  experience, and showed no inclination to disguise or to cast behind him  the honest and manly though unpolished characteristics of his earlier  days. Never was a man further removed from all snobbish affectation. As  little was there, also, of the demagogue art of assuming an uncouthness  or rusticity of manner and outward habit with the mistaken notion of  thus securing particular favor as 'one of the masses.' He chose to  appear then, as in all his later life, precisely what he was. His  deportment was unassuming, though without any awkwardness of reserve.\"    Mr. Crane, an old settler of Tazewell County, says he used to see  Lincoln when passing through Washington, in that county, on his way to  attend court at Metamora; and he remembers him as \"dressed in a homespun  coat that came below his knees and was out at both elbows.\"    Lincoln's tenderness of heart was displayed in his treatment of animals,  toward which he was often performing unusual acts of kindness. On one  occasion, as Mr. Speed relates, Lincoln and the other members of the  Springfield bar had been attending court at Christiansburg, and Mr.  Speed was riding with them toward Springfield. There was quite a party  of these lawyers, riding two by two along a country lane. Lincoln and  John J. Hardin brought up the rear of the cavalcade. \"We had passed  through a thicket of wild plum and crab-apple trees,\" says Mr. Speed,  \"and stopped to water our horses. Hardin came up alone. 'Where is  Lincoln?' we inquired. 'Oh,' replied he, 'when I saw him last he had  caught two young birds which the wind had blown out of their nests, and  he was hunting the nest to put them back.' In a short time Lincoln came  up, having found the nest and placed the young birds in it. The party  laughed at him; but he said, 'I could not have slept if I had not  restored those little birds to their mother.'\"    Again, as Dr. Holland narrates, \"Lincoln was one day riding by a deep"]]]
