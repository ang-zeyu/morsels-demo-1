There he told the Saviour all about his work, and asked him to  go with him that day, preparing the way and enabling him to succeed in  the work on which he had entered. The result was what might have been  expected. He went forth a new man; his heart was interested more deeply  in the truths which he was circulating--they were more precious than  ever to his own soul, and he could recommend his books, as he failed to  do when his heart was cold and prayerless. _That first day he sold more  books than during the whole week before._ In one instance, he sold  several dollars' worth in a family where, as he was afterwards told by  pious men in the neighborhood, the father was most bitterly opposed to  everything connected with true religion. God had prepared that man's  heart, so that he was ready to purchase quite a library for his family.  And in many families that met him that day with the usual salutation,  'no money,' he succeeded in disposing of more than one volume by sale.  As he went from family to family, lifting up his heart in prayer to God  for success in the particular object of his visit, God heard his prayers  and owned his efforts. And so, he assured me, it had been since;  whenever he had been _prayerful_--_prayerful for this particular  object_, and then had diligently and faithfully done his best, he had  invariably succeeded in doing even more than he expected.\"      PRAYER FOUND THE REMEDY FOR THE DISEASE.      \"A correspondent of _The Illustrated Christian Weekly_, states that a  mother of her acquaintance had a child taken alarmingly ill. She sent  for the physician. The child was in convulsions. The doctor began at  once vigorously to apply the customary remedies--cold water to the head,  warm applications to the feet, chafing of the hands and limbs. All was  in vain. The body lost nothing of its dreadful rigidity. Death seemed  close at hand, and absolutely inevitable. At length he left the child,  and sat down by the window, looking out. He seemed, to the agonized  mother, to have abandoned her darling. For herself, she could do nothing  but pray; and even her prayer was but an inarticulate and unvoiced cry  for help. _Suddenly the physician started from his seat. 'Send and see  if there be any jimson weed in the yard_,' he cried. His order was  obeyed; the poisonous weed was found. The remedies were instantly  changed. Enough of the seeds of this deadly weed were brought away by  the medicine to have killed a man. The physician subsequently said that  he thought that in that five minutes every kindred case he had ever  known in a quarter century's practice passed before his mind. Among them  was the one case which suggested the real, but before hidden, cause of  the protracted and dreadful convulsions. And the child was saved.    \"Now, is there anything inconsistent or unphilosophical in the belief  that, at that critical moment, a loving God, answering the mother's  Helpless cry, flashed on the mind of the physician the thought that  saved the child? Is it any objection to that faith to say, the age of  miracles is past? If the mother, may call in a second physician, to  suggest the cause and the cure, may she not call on God? What the doctor  can do for a fellow-practitioner, cannot the Great Physician do? Though  the doctor had often tried and thought, yet it was not till the last  prayer and call on God, brought the remedy to his mind.\"      PRAYER INSTANTANEOUSLY ANSWERED FOR CONVERSION.      On the evening of the fifty-first daily prayer-meeting in Augusta, Ga.,  a large gathering assembled in the St. John's M.E. Church, at which Dr.  Irvine presided, and some very touching communications were read. One  was from a widowed mother, asking thanksgiving for the salvation of her  youngest daughter, recently from a boarding-school in New York city,  where she had finished her education. Some weeks ago she had sought the  prayers of the daily prayer-meeting for the conversion of her precious  child, who was spending a few weeks with some friends seventy miles from  Augusta. Prayers were offered accordingly, but without intimation of any  change. The loving mother sent in a second application or prayer to Dr.  Irvine, to be read on a recent Monday morning; all this without her  daughter's knowledge. On Tuesday the mother received a letter from her  daughter, dated two o'clock on Sabbath, informing her that on that day,  and at that hour, she had resolved to give her heart to Christ,  intending to ask admission to the church at the next communion. Strange  to say, at the very moment when the faithful mother was writing her  application for prayers for that child, she was announcing her own  conversion.    What a verification of the blessed promise: \"Before they call I will  answer; and while they are yet speaking I will hear.\"      HELP FOR THE SHIPWRECKED.      Admiral Sir Thomas Williams, a straight-forward and excellent man, was  in command of a ship crossing the Atlantic Ocean. His course brought him  in sight of the Island of Ascension, at that time uninhabited, and  _never visited by any ship_, except for the purpose of collecting  turtles, which abound on the coast. The island was barely descried on  the horizon, and was not to be noticed at all; but as Sir Thomas looked  at it, he was _seized by an unaccountable desire to steer toward it_.    He felt how strange such a wish would appear to his crew, and _tried to  disregard it; but in vain_. His desire became more and more urgent and  distressing, and foreseeing that it would soon be more difficult to  gratify it, he told his lieutenant to prepare to \"_put about ship_\" and  steer for Ascension. _The officer to whom he spoke ventured to  respectfully represent that changing their course would greatly delay  them_--that just at that moment the men were going to their dinner--that  at least some delay might be allowed.    But these arguments seemed, to increase Captain Williams' anxiety, and  the ship was steered toward the uninteresting little island. All eyes  and spy-glasses were now fixed upon it, and soon something was perceived  on the shore. \"It is white--it is a flag--it must be a signal!\" And when  they neared the shore, it was ascertained that sixteen men, wrecked on  the coast many days before, and suffering the extremity of hunger, had  set up a signal, though almost without hope of relief. What made the  captain steer his ship in the very opposite direction to what he and his  crew wanted to go, but the _superhuman Spirit of God_.      SAMUEL HARRIS'S LAWSUIT, AND HOW THE LORD SETTLED IT FOR HIM.      \"When Samuel Harris, of Virginia, began to preach, his soul was so  absorbed in the work, that he neglected to attend to the duties of this  life. Finding, upon a time, that it was absolutely necessary that he  should provide more grain for his family than he had raised upon his own  farm, he called upon a man who owed him a debt, and told him he would be  glad to receive the money.    \"The man replied: 'I have no money by me, and cannot oblige you.'    \"Harris said; 'I want the money to purchase wheat for my family; and as  you have raised a good crop of wheat, I will take that of you instead of  money, at a current price.'    \"The man answered: 'I have other uses for my wheat, and cannot let you  have it.'    \"'How then,' said Harris, 'do you intend to pay me?'    \"'I never intend to pay you until you sue me,' replied the debtor, 'and  therefore you may begin your suit as soon as you please.'    \"Mr. Harris left him, meditating. Said he to himself, 'What shall I do?  Must I leave preaching, and attend to a vexatious lawsuit? Perhaps a  thousand souls may perish in the meantime, for want of hearing of Jesus!  No; I will not. Well, what will you do for yourself? Why, this will I  do; I will sue him at the Court of Heaven.' Having resolved what he  would do, he turned aside into a wood, and on his knees laid the matter  before the Lord. Mr. Harris felt such an evidence of Divine favor,--he  felt, to use his own expressive language, that Jesus would become  bondsman for the man, and see that he was paid if he went on preaching.  Mr. Harris arose from prayer, resolved to hold the man no longer a  debtor, since Jesus had assumed the payment. He therefore wrote a  receipt in full of all accounts against the man, and dating it in the  woods, where he had prayed, signed it with his own name. Going the next  day by the man's house, on his way to meeting, he gave the receipt to a  servant, directing him to give it to his master. On his return from  meeting, the man hailed him, and demanded what he meant by the receipt  he had sent him in the morning.    \"Mr. Harris replied: 'I mean just as I wrote.'    \"'But you know, sir,' answered the debtor, 'I have never paid you.'    \"'True,' said Mr. Harris, 'and I know you said that you never would  unless I sued you. But, sir, I sued you at the Court of Heaven, and  Jesus entered bail for you, and has agreed to pay me; I have therefore  given you a discharge!'    \"'But I insist upon it,' said the man; 'matters shall not be left so.'    \"'I am well satisfied,' answered Harris. 'Jesus will not fail me. I  leave you to settle the account with him at another day. Farewell.'    \"This operated so effectually on the man's conscience, that in a few  days he _came and paid the debt_.\"      A WAGON-LOAD OF FOOD.      \"A young minister and his wife were sent on to their first charge in  Vermont about the year 1846. On the circuit were few members, and most  of these were in poor circumstances. After a few months the minister and  his wife found themselves getting short of provisions. Finally their  last food had been cooked, and where to look for a new supply was a  question which demanded immediate attention.    \"The morning meal was eaten, not without anxious feelings; but this  young servant of the Most High had laid his all upon the altar, and his  wife also possessed much of the spirit of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11565"],[0,"Friends, though divided: A Tale of the Civil War (#18)"],[1," \"It is wholly false, sir,\" Harry said. \"Seeing that the enemy were so  close, I had placed my pickets well in advance, and ordered my men to  lie down in their clothes, with their arms beside them, on straw in the  kitchens, ready to mount at a moment's warning. I quartered five in each  house, having their horses fastened in front, and one of each party  stationed at the door, where he could observe the horses and wake the  men on the instant. Thus, when my pickets came in with the news that  troops were heard moving toward Chalcombe, my troop was in less than two  minutes in the saddle. As we rode out of the village we heard the first  shot, and five minutes later charged the Roundheads in the streets of  the village. Had we not hastened, methinks that neither Sir Ralph  Willoughby nor any of his troops would have been alive now to tell the  tale. You can question, sir, my lieutenant, or any of my troopers, and  you will hear that matters went precisely as I have told you.\"    \"You have done well indeed, Master Furness,\" Prince Rupert said warmly,  \"and I would that many of my other officers showed the same  circumspection and care as you have done. Now, Sir Ralph, let me hear  what arrangements you made against surprise.\"    \"I set pickets in front of the village,\" Sir Ralph said sulkily.    \"And what besides?\" the prince asked. \"Having done that, did you and  your officers and men go quietly to sleep, as if the enemy were a  hundred miles away?\"    Sir Ralph was silent.    \"Fie, for shame, sir!\" the prince said sternly. \"Your own carelessness  has brought disaster upon you, and instead of frankly owning your fault,  and thanking Master Furness for having redeemed your error, saved the  remnant of your troop, and defeated the Roundheads heavily, your  jealousy and envy of the lad have wrought you to bring false accusations  against him. Enough, sir,\" he said peremptorily, seeing the glance of  hatred which Sir Ralph cast toward Harry. \"Sufficient harm has been done  already by your carelessness--see that no more arises from your bad  temper. I forbid this quarrel to go further; until the king's enemies  are wholly defeated there must be no quarrels between his friends. And  should I hear of any further dispute on your part with Master Furness, I  shall bring it before the king, and obtain his warrant for your  dismissal from this army.\"    The following day Harry and his troop moved further down the river, the  enemy having fallen back from Didcot. He was placed at a village where  there was a ford across the river. The post was of importance, as its  position prevented the enemy from making raids into the country, where  stores of provisions and cattle had been collected for the use of the  army at Oxford. Harry's force was a small one for the defense of such a  post; but there appeared little danger of an attack, as Prince Rupert,  with a large force of cavalry, lay but a mile or two distant. A few days  after their arrival, however, Prince Rupert started with his horse to  drive back a party of the enemy whom he heard were lying some miles  north of Reading.    \"Prince Rupert never seems to have room for two ideas in his head at the  same time,\" Jacob said. \"The moment he hears of an enemy off he rides at  full gallop, forgetting that he has left us alone here. It is well if  the Roundheads at Reading do not sally out and attack us, seeing how  useful this ford would be to them.\"    \"I agree with you, Jacob, and we will forthwith set to work to render  the place as defensible as we may.\"    \"We had best defend the other side of the ford, if they advance,\" Jacob  said. \"We could make a far better stand there.\"    \"That is true, Jacob; but though we could there bar them from entering  our country, they, if they obtained the village, would shut the door to  our entering theirs. No, it is clear that it our duty to defend the  village as long as we can, if we should be attacked.\"    Harry now set his men to work to make loopholes in the cottages and  inclosure walls, and to connect the latter by banks of earth, having  thorn branches set on the top. Just at the ford itself stood a large  water-mill, worked by a stream which here ran into the river. Harry  placed sacks before all the windows, leaving only loopholes through  which to fire. Some of the troop carried pistols only; others had  carbines; and some, short, wide-mouthed guns, which carried large  charges of buckshot. Pickets were sent forward a mile toward Reading.    Early in the afternoon these galloped in with the news that a heavy  column of infantry and cavalry, with two pieces of artillery, were  approaching along the road. Harry at once dispatched a messenger, with  orders to ride until he found Prince Rupert, to tell him of the state he  was in, and ask him to hurry to his assistance, giving assurance that he  would hold the village as long as possible. All now labored vigorously  at the works of defense. Half an hour after the alarm had been given the  enemy were seen approaching.    \"There must be over five hundred men, horse and foot,\" Jacob said, as  from the upper story of the mill he watched with Harry the approach of  the enemy. \"With fifty men we shall never be able to defend the circuit  of the village.\"    \"Not if they attack all round at once,\" Harry agreed. \"But probably  they will fall upon us in column, and behind stone walls we can do much.  We must keep them out as long as we can; then fall back here, and  surround ourselves with a ring of fire.\"    As soon as it was known that the enemy were approaching Harry had given  orders that all the inhabitants should evacuate their houses and cross  the river, taking with them such valuables as they could carry. There  were several horses and carts in the village, and these were at once put  in requisition, and the people crossing and recrossing the river rapidly  carried most of their linen and other valuables over in safety, the men  continuing to labor for the preservation of their goods, even after the  fight commenced.    The Roundheads halted about four hundred yards from the village. Just as  they did so there was a trampling of horses, and Sir Ralph Willoughby,  with his troop, now reduced to thirty strong, rode into the village. He  drew up his horse before Harry.    \"Master Furness,\" he said, \"Prince Rupert has forbidden me to test your  courage in the way gentlemen usually do so. But there is now a means  open. Let us see which will ride furthest--you or I--into the ranks of  yonder horsemen.\"    Harry hesitated a moment; then he said gravely:    \"My life is not my own to throw away, Sir Ralph. My orders are to hold  this place. That I can best do on foot, for even if our troops united  were to rout the enemy's cavalry, their footmen would still remain, and  would carry the village. No, sir, my duty is to fight here.\"    \"I always thought you a coward!\" Sir Ralph exclaimed; \"now I know it,\"  and, with a taunting laugh, he ordered his men to follow him, issued  from the village, and prepared, with his little band, to charge the  Roundhead horse, about a hundred and fifty strong.    Just as they formed line, however, the enemy's' guns opened, and a shot  struck Sir Ralph full in the chest, hurling him, a shattered corpse, to  the ground.    His men, dismayed at the fall of their leader, drew rein.    \"Fall back, men,\" Harry shouted from behind, \"fall back, and make a  stand here. You must be cut to pieces if you advance.\"    The troop, who had no other officer with them, at once obeyed Harry's  orders. They had heard the conversation between him and their leader,  and although prepared to follow Sir Ralph, who was the landlord of most  of them, they saw that Harry was right, and that to attack so numerous a  body of horse and foot was but to invite destruction.          CHAPTER IX.    A STUBBORN DEFENSE.      A half-dozen or so of Sir Ralph Willoughby's troopers declared that now  their lord was dead they would fight no further, and straightway rode  off through the village and across the ford. The rest, however, seeing  that a brave fight against odds was about to commence, declared their  willingness to put themselves under Harry's orders. They were at once  dismounted and scattered along the line of defenses. After the Roundhead  cannon had fired a few shots their cavalry charged, thinking to ride  into the village. But the moment Sir Ralph's troopers had re-entered it  Harry had heaped up across the road a quantity of young trees and bushes  which he had cut in readiness. Not a shot was fired until the horsemen  reached this obstacle, and then so heavy a fire was poured upon them, as  they dismounted and tried to pull it asunder, that, with a loss of many  men, they were forced to retreat.    The infantry now advanced, and a severe fight began. Harry's eighty men,  sheltered behind their walls, inflicted heavy damage upon the enemy,  who, however, pressed on stoutly, one column reaching the obstruction  across the road, and laboring to destroy it. All the horses, with the  exception of twenty, had been sent across the ford, and when Harry saw  that in spite of the efforts of his men the enemy were destroying the  abattis, he mounted twenty men upon these horses, placing Jacob at  their head. Then he drew off as many defenders from other points as he  could, and bade these charge their pistols and blunderbusses to the  mouth with balls. As the enemy effected a breach in the abattis and  streamed in, Jacob with his horse galloped down upon them at full speed.  The reserve poured the fire of their heavily loaded pieces upon the mass  still outside, and then aided Jacob's horse by falling suddenly on those  within. So great was the effect that the enemy were driven back, and the  column retired, the breach in the abattis being hastily filled up,  before the cavalry, who were waiting the opportunity, could charge down  upon it.    In the meantime, however, the enemy were"]]]
