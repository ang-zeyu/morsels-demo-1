Only insist  upon its sticking to the particular text of thought and always showing  you successful at the end. Finish up with a vigorous affirmation of the  \"I am.\" Practise at the same hour daily for 6 months at least.      Exercise No. II.    Retire into the silence. Concentrate earnestly thus: _I send out  strong, positive, healing thought-waves of love to all mankind. Let the  disease-ridden become healthy. Let the weak become strong. Let the  needy ones become prosperous and happy. Let the fearful ones become  filled with courage. Let the cruel become kind and merciful. Let the  hateful and hating ones become loving. Let the impure ones become  pure. Let the bereaved, deserted, sorrow-stricken ones become soothed  and comforted_.    Picture to yourself strong waves of Thought-Force passing out of  you and encircling the whole world. Picture the world as peopled with  men and women manifesting the desired conditions.    The more friends sit together in union of will and soul concentrating  as above-indicated the better. Practise alone if you can find no earnest  and serious-minded ones to join you.    Believe in your power to so help humanity. The power of thought  is unlimited. In blessing others bless yourself. The effect of this  exercise will be far-reaching. It shall follow and be a blessing to you  even after death. Practise regularly at the same place and time as far as  possible.    Be earnest in your work.    Do not talk of your exercises to others.    The above exercises will wonderfully develop and strengthen anyone who  tries them. The deep breathing exercise already given is known as  Pranayama or Controlling the Psychic Breath. Its main purpose is to  give you control over your Prana and unfold the Psychic Force latent in  you. Practised on an impure body and weak lungs it may do harm. Hence  students are advised to undergo the above 10 breathing exercises first  and then, when their lungs have developed the power of endurance, they  should take that up. It will take time, patience, and serious work.  But if the student is sufficiently energetic he will perfect all these  exercises in six months. But follow nature's plan and be slow and steady.      DIET.    You all know that pure food brings pure blood. You should avoid  the two extremes of gluttony and daily fasting and abstemiousness. You  should know (1) What to eat (2) How to eat (3) When to eat.    Concentrated food such as contains the maximum amount of nourishment  in a minimum quantity should be used. The student should study some  reliable hand book on the relative values of food and use his  judgment. We ourselves use nuts, milk, fruits, whole wheat bread, rice  in very small quantity, pulse, etc. Those who are non-meat eaters--and  we advise it strongly--will do well to see to it that their _menu_ has a  good supply of albuminous food, as vegetarians often run the risk of  being overfed as to starch and underfed in nitrogenous foods.    (2) Chew and masticate properly so as to extract the food-Prana in full  and break up the food-substance into very small bits, reducing it to  pulp. Do not be in a hurry to bolt your food but let it linger in your  mouth so as to be properly insalivated and so that the nerves of the  tongue, cheek, etc., may all absorb energy from food. Remember your  stomach is not lined with rows of teeth. This will give you double the  nourishment you get ordinarily, avoid constipation, prevent malnutrition,  non-assimilation and over-eating. Out of a very small quantity of food  you can extract perfect nourishment and thus you avoid loading and  \"stuffing\" the stomach with unnecessary food. It is also economical in  case you are a thrifty soul! Eat to live. Don't live to eat.    (3) Eat when you are hungry. That cultivated \"appetite\" that craves for  satisfaction at certain stated intervals of the day and brings on an  \"all-gone\" fainting, nauseating sensation in the stomach is not real  \"hunger.\" In real hunger there is absolutely no sensation in the stomach  but there is a rich and continuous flow of saliva in the mouth and that  sort of thing makes you enjoy the plainest of fares. Even a dry crust  of bread will taste sweet as Manna. Cut off your breakfasts. Drink  cold water instead. Eat one good, nourishing meal at 12 A. M., and one  light meal in the evening.    Lastly, students, let plain living and high thinking be your motto.  Do not be afraid to eat when you are hungry and so long as you exercise  and work with brain and body even two square meals a day are permissible.  Do not grow ethereal and airy, because then you will not amount to much  in the world's work. Students, who are perfect Brahmacharies, will not  care half as much for lots of food as ordinary folk do. A constant  feeling of satisfaction and fullness is present in such. But hard  workers must never be under-nourished and they require more food than  others.      SLEEP.    It is the depth and relaxation in sleep that counts. High-strung people  find it hard to relax and keep tossing on their pillows. Bathe your feet  in cold water in hot season and in cool water in cold season. That will  draw off the surplus blood gurgitating in your brain. Also bathe the nape  of the neck. The student should engage in meditation before falling to  sleep, as during sleep the Man leaves the physical form and goes to  super-physical planes and it is the last train of thought in your mind  that determines and conforms you to the special super-physical influence  you are to obtain. The physical benefits too shall be great. You will  feel more rested in this way and your sleep will be sleeping a sounder  and more refreshing sleep than otherwise. One of the chief signs of  success in Mental and Physical Control is that your sleeps are  undisturbed and peaceful.    During sleep you are in a passive, relaxed condition and all sorts  of unseen influences play around you. It is good therefore to enclose  yourself in an Astral Shell. Concentrate upon your aura and picture it  as extending some 18 inches all around you and forming a shell around  you. Now take this affirmation to concentrate your mind.    1. I am charging my aura with my Will-Force.    2. It is strong, strong, strong and can and will resist, repel and  drive off all bad influences and admit only pure and holy influence.    3. It will remain around me right along the period of my sleep.    The student is advised to surround himself in this \"auric Shell\"  even when awake so that it may beat off all malign and harmful  thought-forces. As he grows in Will-Power and Self-Confidence, a  Protective Aura will form around him naturally and will be felt by  others.      RELAXATION VERSUS CONTRACTION.    The student should learn to relax his body completely so that it shall  lie still and limp and soft as cotton. He should be able to tense and  contract his muscles so that they will become hard as iron. In all the  physical exercises you will find two special actions (1) Muscle  contraction (2) Stretching. When you contract muscle and harden it, you  have sent currents of nerve-force and will to that part; when you relax  it, you \"let go\" completely. What we want is Strength in Repose ready  to leap into action in the flash of an eye. We have taught you how to  relax in Lesson 2 on Will-Force. You all have noticed a cat crouching  for its prey. How intensely still it is; yet you know what such stillness  means. It is very far from laziness. Relaxation husbands and conserves  nerve-force. It is a great thing to be calm and silent. Calmness is the  centralization of tremendous power. Practise being calm, as far as  you can.      SOLAR ENERGY.    There is great electrical and thermal power in the sun's rays. If the  human body be properly exposed to the sun during the first five hours  in the morning and the evening, the body would absorb energy therefrom  and gain in strength. Do not over do this, especially you of the warm  climate.      LAST WORD ON HEALTH.    Trust Nature. It is her office to keep your body-machine running  in perfect order. \"Prevention is better than cure\"--they say. Observe  the healthy man. See how he lives and follow his example. But note  that body is yours to control and God will not do that work for you.  Also get rid of the stupidity that God sends diseases. Think, study and  observe and you will know what Health Laws are.      CONCLUSION.    Student, I have indicated the lines along which you are to seek the  way to Spiritual Independence. I cannot run your life-affairs, solve your  life-problems, do your work for you. I have pointed out a few principles,  observe, think and complete your knowledge. You must climb the steps  of the ladder of attainment and Self-Perfection yourself.    Fear is a great stumbling-block in the way. Fight it down. Starve it out.  Be earnest. Be thorough. Live your life silently and earnestly. Give  others a helping hand whenever you can without that patronising air of  superiority so characteristic of the modern snobs passing for  \"gentlemen.\" Be proud that you are an \"Indian.\" Follow Indian ideals of  greatness. Consider it a privilege to help deserving souls. We all need  help, encouragement and guidance to some extent. Co-operation,  interdependence are the basic foundations of human well-being. Be strong.  Be manly. Be courageous. Be great and good. Take your place in the  world's evolutionary progress and lend your hand in turning the wheel  of life. In the same measure that you help others, shall you yourself be  helped on all planes of life. Be reasonable. Be just and fair unto  others. Be a source of blessing unto others. So long as you labour under  the vitiating influence of negative thoughts, you cannot achieve much in  any direction. I have told you \"how\" you are to proceed.    May God bless you. May he guide, help and strengthen where I have failed.

In a periodical, entitled _The Friend_, published in Ceylon, it  is stated in the volume for 1837 that the officers belonging to the  ships Quorrah and Alburhak, engaged in the Niger Expedition, were shown  by a native king two tusks, each two feet and a half in circumference at  the base, eight feet long, and weighing upwards of 200 pounds. (Vol. i.  p. 225.) BRODERIP, in his _Zoological Recreations_, p. 255, says a tusk  of 350 pounds' weight was sold at Amsterdam, but he does not quote his  authority.]    But it is manifestly inconsistent with the idea that tusks were given to  the elephant to assist him in digging for his food, to find that the  females are less bountifully supplied with them than the males, whilst  the necessity for their use extends equally to both sexes. The same  argument serves to demonstrate the fallacy of the conjecture, that the  tusks of the elephant were given to him as weapons of offence, for if  such were the case the vast majority in Ceylon, males as well as  females, would be left helpless in presence of an assailant. But  although in their conflicts with one another, those which are provided  with tusks may occasionally push with them clumsily at their opponents;  it is a misapprehension to imagine that tusks are designed specially to  serve \"in warding off the attacks of the wily tiger and the furious  rhinoceros, often securing the victory by one blow which transfixes the  assailant to the earth.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, published by the Society for the  Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, vol. i. p. 68: \"The Elephant,\" ch. iii.  It will be seen that I have quoted repeatedly from this volume, because  it is the most compendious and careful compilation with which I am  acquainted of the information previously existing regarding the  elephant. The author incorporates no speculations of his own, but has  most diligently and agreeably arranged all the facts collected by his  predecessors. The story of antipathy between the elephant and rhinoceros  is probably borrowed from AELIAN _de Nat._, lib. xvii. c. 44.]    So harmless and peaceful is the life of the elephant, that nature  appears to have left it unprovided with any weapon of offence: its trunk  is too delicate an organ to be rudely employed in a conflict with other  animals, and although on an emergency it may push or gore with its tusks  (to which the French have hastily given the term \"_defenses_\"), their  almost vertical position, added to the difficulty of raising its head  above the level of the shoulder, is inconsistent with the idea of their  being designed for attack, since it is impossible for the elephant to  strike an effectual blow, or to \"wield\" its tusks as the deer and the  buffalo can direct their horns. Nor is it easy to conceive under what  circumstances an elephant could have a hostile encounter with either a  rhinoceros or a tiger, with whose pursuits in a state of nature its own  can in no way conflict.    Towards man elephants evince shyness, arising from their love of  solitude and dislike of intrusion; any alarm they exhibit at his  appearance may be reasonably traced to the slaughter which has reduced  their numbers; and as some evidence of this, it has always been observed  that an elephant exhibits greater impatience of the presence of a white  man than of a native. Were its instincts to carry it further, or were it  influenced by any feeling of animosity or cruelty, it must be apparent  that, as against the prodigious numbers that inhabit the forests of  Ceylon, man would wage an unequal contest, and that of the two one or  other must long since have been reduced to a helpless minority.    Official testimony is not wanting in confirmation of this view;--in the  returns of 108 coroners' inquests in Ceylon, during five years, from  1849 to 1855 inclusive, held in cases of death occasioned by wild  animals; 16 are recorded as having been caused by elephants, 15 by  buffaloes, 6 by crocodiles, 2 by boars, 1 by a bear, and 68 by serpents  (the great majority of the last class of sufferers being women and  children, who had been bitten during the night). Little more than  _three_ fatal accidents occurring annually on the average of five years,  is certainly a very small proportion in a population estimated at a  million and a half, in an island abounding with elephants, with which,  independently of casual encounters, voluntary conflicts are daily  stimulated by the love of sport or the hope of gain. Were the elephants  instinctively vicious or even highly irritable in their temperament, the  destruction of human life under the circumstances must have been  infinitely greater. It must also be taken into account, that some of the  accidents recorded may have occurred in the rutting season, when  elephants are subject to fits of temporary fury, known in India by the  term _must_, in Ceylon _mudda_,--a paroxysm which speedily passes away,  but during the fury of which it is dangerous even for the mahout to  approach those ordinarily the gentlest and most familiar.    But, then, the elephant is said to \"entertain an extraordinary dislike  to all quadrupeds; that dogs running near him produce annoyance; that he  is alarmed if a hare start from her form;\" and from Pliny to Buffon  every naturalist has recorded its supposed aversion to swine.[1] These  alleged antipathies are in a great degree, if not entirely, imaginary.  The habits of the elephant are essentially harmless, its wants lead to  no rivalry with other animals, and the food to which it is most attached  flourishes in such abundance that it is obtained without an effort. In  the quiet solitudes of Ceylon, elephants may constantly be seen browsing  peacefully in the immediate vicinity of other animals, and in close  contact with them. I have seen groups of deer and wild buffaloes  reclining in the sandy bed of a river in the dry season, and elephants  plucking the branches close beside them. They show no impatience in the  company of the elk, the bear, and the wild hog; and on the other hand, I  have never discovered an instance in which these animals have evinced  any apprehension of elephants. The elephant's natural timidity, however,  is such that it becomes alarmed on the appearance in the jungle of any  animal with which it is not familiar. It is said to be afraid of the  horse; but from my own experience, I should say it is the horse that is  alarmed at the aspect of the elephant. In the same way, from some  unaccountable impulse, the horse has an antipathy to the camel, and  evinces extreme impatience, both of the sight and the smell of that  animal.[2] When enraged, an elephant will not hesitate to charge a rider  on horseback; but it is against the man, not against the horse, that his  fury is directed; and no instance has been ever known of his wantonly  assailing a horse. A horse, belonging to the late Major Rogers[3], had  run away from his groom, and was found some considerable time afterwards  grazing quietly with a herd of elephants. In DE BRY'S splendid  collection of travels, however, there is included \"_The voyage of a  Certain Englishman to Cambay_;\" in which the author asserts that at  Agra, in the year 1607, he was present at a spectacle given by the  Viceregent of the great Mogul, in the course of which he saw an elephant  destroy two horses, by seizing them in its trunk, and crushing them  under foot.[4] But the display was avowedly an artificial one, and the  creature must have been cruelly tutored for the occasion.    [Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, \"The Elephant,\" ch. iii.]    [Footnote 2: This peculiarity was noticed by the ancients, and is  recorded by Herodotus: [Greek: \"kamelon hippos phobeetai, kai ouk  anechetai oute ten ideen autes oreon oute ten odmen osphrainomenos\"]  (Herod. ch. 80). Camels have long been bred by the Grand Duke of  Tuscany, at his establishment near Pisa, and even there the same  instinctive dislike to them is manifested by the horse, which it is  necessary to train and accustom to their presence in order to avoid  accidents. Mr. BRODERIP mentions, that, \"when the precaution of such  training has not been adopted, the sudden and dangerous terror with  which a horse is seized in coming unexpectedly upon one of them is  excessive.\"--_Note-book of a Naturalist_, ch. iv. p. 113.]    [Footnote 3: Major ROGERS was many years the chief civil officer of  Government in the district of Oovah, where he was killed by lightning,  1845.]    [Footnote 4: \"Quidam etiam cum equis silvestribus pugnant. Saepe unus  elephas cum sex equis committitur; atque ipse adeo interfui cum unus  elephas duos equos cum primo impetu protinus prosternerit;--injecta enim  jugulis ipsorum longa proboscide, ad se protractos, dentibus porro  comminuit ac protrivit.\" _Angli Cujusdam in Cambayam Navigatio_. DE BRY,  _Coll., &c._, vol. iii. ch. xvi. p. 31.]    Pigs are constantly to be seen feeding about the stables of the tame  elephants, which manifest no repugnance to them. As to the smaller  animals, the elephant undoubtedly evinces uneasiness at the presence of  a dog, but this is referable to the same cause as its impatience of a  horse, namely, that neither is habitually seen by it in the forest; but  it would be idle to suppose that this feeling could amount to hostility  against a creature incapable of inflicting on it the slightest  injury.[1] The truth I apprehend to be that, when they meet, the  impudence and impertinences of the dog are offensive to the gravity of  the elephant, and incompatible with his love of solitude and ease. Or  may it be assumed as an evidence of the sagacity of the elephant, that  the only two animals to which it manifests an antipathy, are the two  which it has seen only in the"]]]
