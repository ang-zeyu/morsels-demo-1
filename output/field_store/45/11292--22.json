I  kinda shy at any contract the size uh that one. I've got to start the  wagons out, if this weather holds good, and I want to go with 'em--for  a while, anyhow--and see how things stack up on the range. And what  _you've_ got to do is to go and lease every foot uh land you can. Eh?  State land. All the land around here almost is State land--all that's  surveyed and that ain't held by private owners. And State land can be  leased for a term uh years.    \"The way they do it, yuh start in and go over the map all samee flea;  yuh lease a section here and there and skip one and take the next,  and so on, and then if yuh need to yuh throw a fence around the whole  blame chunk--and there yuh are. No, it _ain't_ cheating, because if  anybody don't like it real bad, they can raise the long howl and make  yuh revise your fencing; but in this neck uh the woods folks don't  howl over a little thing like that, because you could lift up your  own voice over something they've done, and there'd be a fine, pretty  chorus! So that's what yuh can do if yuh want to--but anyway, yuh want  to get right after that leasing. It'll cost yuh something, but we're  just plumb obliged to protect ourselves. See?\"    At that point he heard Flora laugh, and got up hastily, remembering  the presence of the Pilgrim on the ranch.    \"I see, and I will think it over and take what precautionary measures  are necessary and possible.\"    Billy, not quite sure that he had sufficiently impressed Dill with  the importance of the matter, turned at the door and looked in again,  meaning to add an emphatic word or two; but when he saw that Dill was  staring round-eyed at nothing at all, and that Lamb was lying  sprawled wide open on the floor, his face relaxed from its anxious  determination.    \"I got his think-works going--he'll do the rest,\" he told himself  satisfiedly, and pushed the subject from him. Just now he wanted to  make sure the Pilgrim wasn't getting more smiles than were coming to  him--and if you had left the decision of that with Billy, the Pilgrim  would have had none at all.    \"I wisht he'd _do_ something I could lay my finger on--damn him,\" he  reflected. \"I can't kick him out on the strength uh my own private  opinion. I'd just simply lay myself wide open to all kinds uh  remarks. I _ain't_ jealous; he ain't got any particular stand-in with  Flora--but if I started action on him, that's what the general verdict  would be. Oh, thunder!\"    Nothing of his thoughts showed in his manner when he went out to where  they were. He found them just putting up a target made of a sheet of  tablet paper marked with a lead pencil into rings and an uncertain  centre, and he went straight into the game with a smile. He loaded  the gun for Flora, showed her exactly how to \"draw a fine bead,\" and  otherwise deported himself in a way not calculated to be pleasing to  the Pilgrim. He called her Flora boldly whenever occasion offered, and  he exulted inwardly at the proprietary way in which she said \"Billy  Boy\" and ordered him around. Of course, _he_ knew quite well that  there was nothing but frank-eyed friendship back of it all; but the  Pilgrim plainly did not know and was a good deal inclined to sulk over  his interpretation.    So Billy, when came the time for sleeping, grinned in the dark of his  room and dwelt with much satisfaction upon the manner of the Pilgrim's  departure. He prophesied optimistically that he guessed that would  hold the Pilgrim for a while, and that he himself could go on round-up  and not worry any over what was happening at the ranch.    For the Pilgrim had come into the kitchen, ostensibly for a drink of  water, and had found Miss Flora fussily adjusting the Klondyke nugget  pin in the tie of Charming Billy, as is the way of women when they  know they may bully a man with impunity--and she was saying: \"Now,  Billy Boy, if you don't learn to stick that pin in straight and not  have the point standing out a foot, I'll--\" That is where the Pilgrim  came in and interrupted. And he choked over the dipper of water even  as Billy choked over his glee, and left the ranch within fifteen  minutes and rode, as Billy observed to the girl, \"with a haughty  spine.\"    \"Oh, joy!\" chuckled Billy when he lived those minutes over again, and  punched the pillow facetiously. \"Oh, joy, oh Johnathan! I guess maybe  he didn't get a jolt, huh? And the way--the very _tone_ when I called  her Flora--sounded like the day was set for the wedding and we'd gone  and ordered the furniture!\"    The mood of him was still triumphant three days after when he turned  in his saddle and waved his hand to Flora, who waved wistfully back at  him. \"It ain't any cinch right now--but I'll have her yet,\" he cheered  himself when the twinge of parting was keenest.          CHAPTER XV.    _The Shadow Falls Lightly._      Over the green uplands, into the coulees and the brushy creek-bottoms  swept the sun-browned riders of the Double-Crank; jangling and  rattling over untrailed prairie sod, the bed and mess wagons followed  after with hasty camping at the places Billy appointed for brief  sleeping and briefer eating, a hastier repacking and then the hurry  over the prairies to the next stop. Here, a wide coulee lay yawning  languorously in the sunshine with a gossipy trout stream for company;  with meadowlarks rippling melodiously from bush and weed or hunting  worms and bugs for their nestful of gaping mouths; with gophers  trailing snakily through the tall grasses; and out in the barren  centre where the yellow earth was pimpled with little mounds,  plump-bodied prairie dogs sitting pertly upon their stubby tails the  while they chittered shrewishly at the world; and over all a lazy,  smiling sky with clouds always drifting and trailing shadows across  the prairie-dog towns and the coulee and the creek, and a soft wind  stirring the grasses.    Then the prairie dogs would stand a-tiptoe to listen. The meadowlarks  would stop their singing--even the trailing shadows would seem to  waver uncertainly--and only the creek would go gurgling on, uncaring.  Around a bend would rattle the wagons of the Double-Crank, with a lone  rider trotting before to point the way; down to the very bank of the  uncaring creek they would go. There would be hurrying to and fro with  much clamor of wood-chopping, tent-raising and all the little man-made  noises of camp life and cooking. There would be the added clamor  of the cavvy, and later, of tired riders galloping heavily into the  coulee, and of many voices upraised in full-toned talk with now and  then a burst of laughter.    All these things, and the prairie folk huddled trembling in their  homes, a mute agony of fear racking their small bodies. Only the creek  and the lazy, wide-mouthed coulee and the trailing clouds and the soft  wind seemed not to mind.    Came another sunrise and with it the clamor, the voices, the rattle of  riding gear, the trampling. Then a final burst and rattle, a dying of  sounds in the distance, a silence as the round-up swept on over the  range-land, miles away to the next camping place. Then the little  prairie folk--the gopher, the plump-bodied prairie dogs, the mice and  the rabbits, would listen long before they crept timidly out to sniff  suspiciously the still-tainted air and inspect curiously and with  instinctive aversion the strange marks left on the earth to show that  it was all something more than a horrible nightmare.    So, under cloud and sun, when the wind blew soft and when it raved  over the shrinking land, when the cold rain drove men into their  yellow slickers and set horses to humping backs and turning tail to  the drive of it and one heard the cook muttering profanity because the  wood was wet and the water ran down the stovepipe and hungry men must  wait because the stove would not \"draw,\" the Double-Crank raked the  range. Horses grew lean and ill-fitting saddles worked their wicked  will upon backs that shrank to their touch of a morning. Wild range  cattle were herded, a scared bunch of restlessness, during long, hot  forenoons, or longer, hotter afternoons, while calves that had  known no misfortune beyond a wet back or a searching wind learned,  panic-stricken, the agony of capture and rough handling and  tight-drawn ropes and, last and worst, the terrible, searing iron.    There were not so many of them--these reluctant, wild-eyed pupils  in the school of life. Charming Billy, sitting his horse and keeping  tally of the victims in his shabby little book, began to know the  sinking of spirit that comes to a man when he finds that things  have, after all, gone less smoothly than he had imagined. There were  withered carcasses scattered through the coulee bottoms and upon side  hills that had some time made slippery climbing for a poor, weak cow.  The loss was not crippling, but it was greater than he had expected.  He remembered certain biting storms which had hidden deep the grasses,  and certain short-lived chinooks that had served only to soften the  surface of the snow so that the cold, coming after, might freeze it  the harder.    It had not been a hard winter, as winters go, but the loss of cows had  been above the average and the crop of calves below, and Billy for  the first time faced squarely the fact that, in the cattle business  as well as in others, there are downs to match the ups. In his castle  building, and so far in his realization of his dreams, he had not  taken much account of the downs.    Thus it was that, when they swung back from the reservation and camped  for a day upon lower Burnt Willow, he felt a great yearning for the  ranch and for sight of the girl who lived there. For excuses he had  the mail and the natural wish to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12225"],[0,"Tales of lonely trails (#18)"],[1,"lope, and by  virtue of a majority we decided to try the direction Jim and I thought  best. My companions led the way, carrying the lioness suspended on the  pole. I brought up the rear, packing my rifle, camera, lasso, canteen  and a chain.    It was killing work. We had to rest every few steps. Often we would  fall. Jim laughed, Jones swore, and I groaned. Sometimes I had to drop  my things to help my companions. So we toiled wearily up the loose,  steep way.    \"What's she shakin' like that for?\" asked Jim suddenly.    Jones let down his end of the pole and turned quickly. Little tremors  quivered over the lissome body of the lioness.    \"She's dying,\" cried Jim, jerking out the stick between her teeth and  slipping off the wire muzzle.    Her mouth opened and her frothy tongue lolled out. Jones pointed to  her quivering sides and then raised her eyelids. We saw the eyes  already glazing, solemnly fixed.    \"She's gone,\" he said.    Very soon she lay inert and lifeless. Then we sat beside her without  a word, and we could hardly for the moment have been more stunned and  heartbroken if it had been the tragic death of one of our kind.  In that wild environment, obsessed by the desire to capture those  beautiful cats alive, the fateful ending of the successful chase was  felt out of all proportion.    \"Shore she's dead,\" said Jim. \"And wasn't she a beauty? What was  wrong?\"    \"The heat and lack of water,\" replied Jones. \"She choked. What idiots  we were! Why didn't we think to give her a drink.\"    So we passionately protested against our want of fore-thought, and  looked again and again with the hope that she might come to. But death  had stilled the wild heart. We gave up presently, still did not move  on. We were exhausted, and all the while the hounds lay panting on the  rocks, the bees hummed, the flies buzzed. The red colors of the upper  walls and the purple shades of the lower darkened silently.      VI    \"Shore we can't set here all night,\" said Jim. \"Let's skin the lion  an' feed the hounds.\"    The most astonishing thing in our eventful day was the amount of meat  stowed away by the dogs. Lion flesh appealed to their appetites. If  hungry Moze had an ounce of meat, he had ten pounds. It seemed a good  opportunity to see how much the old gladiator could eat; and Jim and I  cut chunks of meat as fast as possible. Moze gulped them with absolute  unconcern of such a thing as mastication. At length he reached his  limit, possibly for the first time in his life, and looking longingly  at a juicy red strip Jim held out, he refused it with manifest shame.  Then he wobbled and fell down.    We called to him as we started to climb the slope, but he did not  come. Then the business of conquering that ascent of sliding stone  absorbed all our faculties and strength. Little headway could we have  made had it not been for the brush. We toiled up a few feet only to  slide back and so it went on until we were weary of life.    When one by one we at last gained the rim and sat there to recover  breath, the sun was a half globe of fire burning over the western  ramparts. A red sunset bathed the canyon in crimson, painting the  walls, tinting the shadows to resemble dropping mists of blood. It was  beautiful and enthralling to my eyes, but I turned away because it  wore the mantle of tragedy.    Dispirited and worn out, we trooped into camp to find Emett and a  steaming supper. Between bites the three of us related the story of  the red lioness. Emett whistled long and low and then expressed his  regret in no light terms.    \"Roping wild steers and mustangs is play to this work,\" he said in  conclusion.    I was too tired to tease our captive lions that evening; even the  glowing camp-fire tempted me in vain, and I crawled into my bed with  eyes already glued shut.    A heavy weight on my feet stirred me from oblivion. At first, when  only half awake, I could not realize what had fallen on my bed, then  hearing a deep groan I knew Moze had come back. I was dropping off  again when a strange, low sound caused my eyes to open wide. The black  night had faded to the gray of dawn. The sound I recognized at once  to be the Navajo's morning chant. I lay there and listened. Soft and  monotonous, wild and swelling, but always low and strange, the savage  song to the break of day was exquisitely beautiful and harmonious. I  wondered what the literal meaning of his words could have been. The  significance needed no translation. To the black shadows fading away,  to the brightening of the gray light, to the glow of the east, to the  morning sun, to the Giver of Life--to these the Indian chanted his  prayer.    Could there have been a better prayer? Pagan or not, the Navajo with  his forefathers felt the spiritual power of the trees, the rocks, the  light and sun, and he prayed to that which was divinely helpful to him  in all the mystery of his unintelligible life.    We did not crawl out that morning as early as usual, for it was to be  a day of rest. When we did, a mooted question arose--whether we or the  hounds were the more crippled. Ranger did not show himself; Don could  just walk and that was all; Moze was either too full or too tired to  move; Sounder nursed a foot and Jude favored her lame leg.    After lunch we brightened up somewhat and set ourselves different  tasks. Jones had misplaced or lost his wire and began to turn the camp  topsy-turvy in his impatient efforts to locate it. The wire, however,  was not to be found. This was a calamity, for, as we asked each other,  how could we muzzle lions without wire? Moreover, a half dozen heavy  leather straps which I had bought in Kanab for use as lion collars had  disappeared. We had only one collar left, the one that Jones had put  on the red lioness.    Whereupon we began to blame each other, to argue, to grow heated and  naturally from that to become angry. It seems a fatality of campers  along a wild trail, like explorers in an unknown land, to be prone to  fight. If there is an explanation of this singular fact, it must be  that men at such time lose their poise and veneer of civilization; in  brief, they go back. At all events we had it hot and heavy, with the  center of attack gradually focusing on Jones, and as he was always  losing something, naturally we united in force against him.    Fortunately, we were interrupted by yells from the Navajo off in the  woods. The brushing of branches and pounding of hoofs preceded his  appearance. In some remarkable manner he had gotten a bridle on Marc,  and from the way the big stallion hurled his huge bulk over logs and  through thickets, it appeared evident he meant to usurp Jim's ambition  and kill the Navajo. Hearing Emett yell, the Indian turned Marc toward  camp. The horse slowed down when he neared the glade and tried to  buck. But Navvy kept his head up. With that Marc seemed to give way to  ungovernable rage and plunged right through camp; he knocked over the  dogs' shelter and thundered down the ridge.    Now the Navajo, with the bridle in his hand was thoroughly at home. He  was getting his revenge on Marc, and he would have kept his seat on a  wild mustang, but Marc swerved suddenly under a low branch of a pine,  sweeping the Indian off.    When Navvy did not rise we began to fear he had been seriously hurt,  perhaps killed, and we ran to where he lay.    Face downward, hands outstretched, with no movement of body or muscle,  he certainly appeared dead.    \"Badly hurt,\" said Emett, \"probably back broken. I have seen it before  from just such accidents.\"    \"Oh no!\" cried Jones, and I felt so deeply I could not speak. Jim, who  always wanted Navvy to be a dead Indian, looked profoundly sorry.    \"He's a dead Indian, all right,\" replied Emett.    We rose from our stooping postures and stood around, uncertain and  deeply grieved, until a mournful groan from Navvy afforded us much  relief.    \"That's your dead Indian,\" exclaimed Jones.    Emett stooped again and felt the Indian's back and got in reward  another mournful groan.    \"It's his back,\" said Emett, and true to his ruling passion, forever  to minister to the needs of horses, men, and things, he began to rub  the Indian and call for the liniment.    [Illustration: TREED LION]    [Illustration: TREED LION]    Jim went to fetch it, while I, still believing the Navvy to be  dangerously hurt, knelt by him and pulled up his shirt, exposing the  hollow of his brown back.    \"Here we are,\" said Jim, returning on the run with the bottle.    \"Pour some on,\" replied Emett.    Jim removed the cork and soused the liniment all over the Indian's  back.    \"Don't waste it,\" remonstrated Emett, starting to rub Navvy's back.    Then occurred a most extraordinary thing. A convulsion seemed to  quiver through the Indian's body; he rose at a single leap, and  uttering a wild, piercing yell broke into a run. I never saw an Indian  or anybody else run so fleetly. Yell after yell pealed back to us.    Absolutely dumfounded we all gazed at each other.    \"That's your dead Indian!\" ejaculated Jim.    \"What the hell!\" exclaimed Emett, who seldom used such language.    \"Look here!\" cried Jones, grabbing the bottle. \"See! Don't you see  it?\"    Jim fell face downward and began to shake.    \"What?\" shouted Emett and I together.    \"Turpentine, you idiots! Turpentine! Jim brought the wrong bottle!\"    In another second three more forms lay stretched out on the sward, and  the forest rang with sounds of mirth.      VII    That night the wind switched and blew cold from the north, and so  strong that the camp-fire roared like a furnace. \"More snow\" was the  verdict of all of us, and in view of this, I invited the Navajo to  share my tent.    \"Sleepie-me,\" I said to him.    \"Me savvy,\" he replied and forthwith proceeded to make his bed with  me.    Much to my surprise all my comrades raised protestations, which  struck me as being singularly selfish considering they would not be"]]]
