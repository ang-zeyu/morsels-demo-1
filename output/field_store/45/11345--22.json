You name _guineas_, whereas I only get _pounds sterling_, and I hear there  is a difference between these. Do not be angry with _un pauvre musicien  autrichien_, who is still at a very low ebb.

TO HERR GEHEIMRATH VON KOeNNERITZ,--DRESDEN,[1]  DIRECTOR OF THE ROYAL ORCHESTRA AND THEATRE IN SAXONY.    Hetzendorf, July 17, 1823.    SIR,--    I have too long deferred sending you a signed receipt and thanks, but I  feel sure you will pardon the delay from my great pressure of business,  owing to my health having improved, and God knows how long this may  continue. The description given by my dear friend Maria Weber[2] of your  generous and noble disposition encourages me to apply to you on another  subject, namely, about a Grand Mass which I am now issuing in manuscript.  Though I have met with a previous refusal on this matter [337], still, as  my esteemed Cardinal, H.R. Highness the Archduke Rudolph, has written to  H.R.H. Prince Anton, requesting him to recommend the Mass to his Majesty  the King of Saxony, I think this fresh application might at all events be  made, as I should consider it a great honor to number among my  distinguished subscribers (such as the King of Prussia, the Emperor of  Russia, the King of France, &c.) so great a connoisseur in music as the  King of Saxony.    I leave it to you, sir, to decide from this statement how and when you can  best effect my purpose. I am unable to send you to-day the application for  a subscription to my Mass to H.M. the King of Saxony, but I will do so by  the next post. In any event I feel assured that you will not think I am one  of those who compose for the sake of paltry gain; but how often do events  occur which constrain a man to act contrary to his inclinations and his  principles? My Cardinal is a benevolent Prince, but means are wanting! I  hope to receive your forgiveness for my apparent importunity. If my poor  abilities can in any way be employed in your service, what extreme pleasure  it would give me.    I am, sir, with esteem,  Your expectant    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: The director-general of the Dresden theatre at that time was  Von Koenneritz, who sent Beethoven forty ducats (requesting a receipt) for  his opera of _Fidelio_, performed with great applause April 29, 1823, and  conducted by C.M. von Weber. Madame Schroeder-Devrient made her _debut_ in  the character of Leonore.]    [Footnote 2: In Weber's _Biography_ it is stated (Vol. II. p. 465) that  Beethoven and Weber exchanged several letters about the performance of  _Fidelio_, and in fact Weber did receive letters from Beethoven on February  16, April 10, and June 9. Unhappily, no part of this correspondence has yet  been discovered, except a fragment of the sketch of a letter written by  Weber of January 28, 1823, which sufficiently proves that Beethoven was  right in calling him his _friend_. It is as follows:--\"This mighty work,  teeming with German grandeur and depth of feeling, having been given under  my direction at Prague, had enabled me to acquire the most enthusiastic and  instructive knowledge of its inner essence, by means of which I hope to  produce it before the public here with full effect, provided as I am with  all possible accessories for the purpose. Each performance will be a  festival to me, permitting me to pay that homage to your mighty spirit  which dwells in the inmost recesses of my heart, where love and admiration  strive for the mastery.\" On October 5 of this year, Weber visited Beethoven  in Baden, with Haslinger and Benedict.]      348.    TO HERR V. KOeNNERITZ,--DRESDEN.    Vienna, July 25, 1823.    SIR,--    Forgive my importunity in sending to your care the enclosed letter from me  to his R.H. Prince Anton of Saxony; it contains an application to his  Majesty the King of Saxony to subscribe to a mass of mine. I recently  mentioned to you that the Cardinal Archduke Rudolph had written to his M.  the King of Saxony about this Mass; I entreat you to use all your influence  in this matter, and I leave it entirely to your own judgment and knowledge  of local matters to act as you think best. Although I do not doubt that the  recommendation of my Cardinal will have considerable weight, still the  decision of his Majesty cannot fail to be much influenced by the advice of  the Administrator of objects connected with the fine arts. Hitherto, in  spite of apparent brilliant success, I have scarcely realized as much as a  publisher would have given me for the work, the expenses of copying being  so very great. It was the idea of my friends to circulate this Mass, for,  thank God! I am a mere novice in all speculations. In the mean time, there  is not a single _employe_ of our Government who has not been, like myself,  a loser. Had it not been for my continued bad health for many years past, a  foreign country would at least have enabled me to live free from all cares  except those for art. Judge me kindly, and not harshly; I live only for my  art, and my sole wish is to fulfil my duties as a man; but this, alas!  cannot always be accomplished without the influence of the _subterranean  powers_. While commending my cause to you, I also venture to hope that your  love of art, and above all your philanthropy, will induce you to be so good  as to write me a few lines, informing me of the result as soon as you are  acquainted with it.    I am, sir, with high consideration,    Your obedient    BEETHOVEN.      349.    TO SCHINDLER.    August, 1823.    YOU SAMOTHRACIAN VILLAIN!--    Make haste and come, for the weather is just right. Better early than  late--_presto, prestissimo_! We are to drive from here.[1]    [Footnote 1: Beethoven had apartments in a summer residence of Baron  Pronay's on his beautiful property at Hetzendorf. Suddenly, however, the  _maestro_, deeply immersed in the _Ninth Symphony_, was no longer satisfied  with this abode, because \"the Baron would persist in making him profound  bows every time that he met him.\" So, with the help of Schindler and Frau  Schnaps, he removed to Baden in August, 1823.]      350.    TO HIS NEPHEW.    Baden, August 16, 1823.    MY DEAR BOY,--    I did not wish to say anything to you till I found my health improving  here, which, however, is scarcely even yet the case. I came here with a  cold and catarrh, which were very trying to me, my constitution being  naturally rheumatic, which will, I fear, soon cut the thread of my life,  or, still worse, gradually wear it away. The miserable state of my  digestive organs, too, can only be restored by medicines and diet, and for  this I have to thank my _faithful_ servants! You will learn how constantly  I am in the open air when I tell you that to-day for the first time I  properly (or improperly, though it was involuntary) resumed my suit to my  Muse. I _must_ work, but do not wish it to be known. Nothing can be more  tempting (to me at least) than the enjoyment of beautiful Nature at these  baths, but _nous sommes trop pauvres, et il faut ecrire ou de n'avoir pas  de quoi_. Get on, and make every preparation for your examination, and be  unassuming, so that you may prove yourself higher and better than people  expect. Send your linen here at once; your gray trousers must still be  wearable, at all events at home; for, my dear son, you are indeed very  _dear_ to me! My address is, \"At the coppersmith's,\" &c. Write instantly to  say that you have got this letter. I will send a few lines to that  contemptible creature, Schindler, though I am most unwilling to have  anything to do with such a wretch. If we could write as quickly as we think  and feel, I could say a great deal not a little remarkable; but for to-day  I can only add that I wish a certain Carl may prove worthy of all my love  and unwearied care, and learn fully to appreciate it.    Though not certainly exacting, as you know, still there are many ways in  which we can show those who are better and nobler than ourselves that we  acknowledge their superiority.    I embrace you from my heart.    Your faithful and true    FATHER.      351.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    August, 1823.    I am really very ill, and not suffering from my eyes alone. I intend to  drag myself to-morrow to Baden, to look out for a lodging, and to go there  altogether in the course of a few days. The air in town has a very bad  effect on my whole organization, and has really injured my health, having  gone twice to town to consult my physicians. It will be easier for me to  repair to Y.R.H. in Baden. I am quite inconsolable, both on account of  Y.R.H. and myself, that my usefulness is thus limited. I have marked some  things in the Variations, but I can explain these better verbally.    [K.]      352.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    Baden, August 22, 1823.    Your gracious letter led me to believe that Y.R.H. intended to return to  Baden, where I arrived on the 13th, very ill; but I am now better. I had  recently another inflammatory cold, having just recovered from one. My  digestion, too, was miserable, and my eyes very bad; in short, my whole  system seemed impaired. I was obliged to make the effort to come here,  without even being able to see Y.R.H. Thank God, my eyes are so much better  that I can again venture to make tolerable use of them by daylight. My  other maladies, too, are improving, and I cannot expect more in so short a  period. How I wish that Y.R.H. were only here, when in a few days we could  entirely make up for lost time. Perhaps I may still be so fortunate as to  see Y.R.H. here, and be able to show my zeal to serve Y.R.H. How deeply  does this cause me to lament my unhappy state of health.

After it had been played through, then all the players  discussed it and offered their criticism. Indeed Franz was composing  at such an astonishing rate, that it was difficult to keep him  supplied with music paper. One of his works of this time was a  fantasia for four hands, in twelve movements. Then came a first  attempt at song writing, a long affair which also contained twelve  movements, and was in melancholy mood.    Five years the boy Franz Schubert remained at the Convict School and  as he had decided to give himself entirely to music, there was no  reason for his remaining longer in the school. At the end of the year  1813, he left, and his departure was celebrated by the composition of  his first Symphony, in honor of Dr. Lang, the musical director. The  lad, now seventeen, stood at the beginning of his career; he was full  of hope and energy, and determined to follow in the footsteps of the  great masters of music. Of all his compositions so far produced, his  songs seemed to be the most spontaneous. He probably did not guess  that he was to open up new paths in this field.    Hardly had he left the school when he was drafted for the army. This  meant several years of virtual captivity, for conscription could not  be avoided. The only other thing he could do was to return home and  become a teacher in his father's school. He chose the lesser evil and  qualified at once to become his father's assistant, which would also  assure him a certain amount of leisure. We can imagine him installed  as teacher of the infant class, and realize how distasteful was the  daily round of school work, and how he longed to have it over, that he  might put on paper all the lovely themes that had come to him through  the school day. Other bright spots were the happy hours he spent with  the Grob family, who lived also in the district of Lichtenthal.  The family consisted of a mother, a son and daughter. They were all  musical. Therese Grob had a fine voice and she enjoyed the songs  Schubert brought her to sing, while her brother Heinrich could play  both piano and 'cello. Many evenings filled with music were passed by  the young people. His friends at the Convict too, welcomed each new  piece he wrote. Nor did he forget his old master Holzer, the organist  of the little church where the composer himself regularly attended.  During 1814, Schubert composed his first mass, which was performed  October 16. It excited so much interest that it was repeated ten days  later at the Augustine church. Franz conducted, the choir was led  by Holzer, Ferdinand sat at the organ, and Therese sang the soprano  solos. In the audience sat old Salieri, Court Capellmeister of Vienna,  with whom Beethoven had studied. Salieri praised Schubert for his  work, and said that he should become his pupil. He kept his word and  gave the young composer daily lessons for some time. The father was  so proud and happy that he bought a five octave piano for his boy, to  celebrate the event.    Schubert added many compositions to his list this year, among them  seventeen songs, including \"Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel.\" His  acquaintance with the poet Johann Mayrhofer, with whom he soon became  intimate, was of benefit to both. The poet produced verses that  his friend might set to music. The following year, 1815, he wrote a  hundred and thirty-seven songs, to say nothing of six operas, and much  music for church and piano. Twenty-nine of these songs were written  in the month of August. One day in August eight songs were created; on  another day seven. Some of the songs were quite long, making between  twenty and thirty pages when printed.    A new friend came into Schubert's life the next year. His name was  Franz Schober, and he intended entering the University in Vienna.  Being a great lover of music and also familiar with some of Schubert's  manuscript songs, he lost no time, on arriving in Vienna, in seeking  out the composer. He found the young musician at his desk very busily  writing. School work was over for the day, and he could compose in  peace. The two young men became friends at once, for they felt the  sympathetic bond between them. They were soon talking as though they  had always known each other. In a few words Schubert told his new  friend how he was situated at home, and how he disliked the daily  drudgery of school teaching. On hearing of these trials Schober  suggested they should make a home together, which arrangement would  free the composer from the grinding life he was living and enable him  to give his whole time to his art. The proposal delighted Franz, and  the father willingly gave his consent. And so it came about that  the composer was free at last, and took up his abode at his friend's  lodgings. He insisted on giving him musical instruction, to make some  return for all his kindness, though this did not last long, owing to  the dislike Franz always had for teaching of any sort.    Schubert, at the age of twenty-four, had composed a great quantity  of music, but none of it had as yet been published. He was almost  unknown, and publishers were unwilling to undertake issuing the work  of an unknown man. When his songs were performed by good artists,  as had been done a number of times, they won instant recognition and  success. Seeing that the publishers were unwilling to print the work  of an unknown musician, two of Schubert's friends undertook to publish  the \"Erlking,\" one of his first songs, at their own risk. At the  Sonnleithner mansion, where musicals were regularly held, the  \"Erlking\" had been much applauded, and when it was decided to have it  published, the decision was announced. A hundred copies were at once  subscribed for, and with this encouragement the engraving of the  \"Erlking\" and \"Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel\" was forthwith begun.  The pieces were sold by the music publishers on commission. The plan  succeeded beyond expectation, so that other songs were issued in the  same way, until, when seven had appeared the publishers were willing  to risk the engraving of other songs themselves. Before all this had  taken place, Johann Vogl, an admired opera singer in Vienna at the  time, had learned Schubert's \"Erlking,\" and had sung it in March,  1821, at a public concert patronized by royalty. The song was received  with storms of applause. Schober, who knew the singer, constantly  talked to him about the gifts of his friend and begged him to come and  see Schubert. At last one day he consented. They found the composer  hard at work as usual, music sheets covering the floor as well as the  table and chair. Vogl, used to the highest society, made himself quite  at home and did his best to put Schubert at his ease, but the  composer remained shy and confused. The singer began looking over some  manuscripts. When he left he shook Schubert's hand warmly, remarking;  \"There is stuff in you, but you squander your fine thoughts instead of  making the most of them.\"    Vogl had been much impressed by what he had seen that day, and  repeated his visit. Before long the two were close friends. Schubert  wrote to his brother: \"When Vogl sings and I accompany him, we seem  for the moment to be one.\" Vogl wrote of Schubert's songs that they  were \"truly divine inspirations.\"    Schubert's residence with his friend Schober only lasted six months,  for Schober's brother came to live with him, and the composer had to  shift for himself. Teaching was exceedingly distasteful to him, yet as  his music did not bring in anything for years after he left home,  he had to find some means of making a living. In these straits he  accepted a position as music teacher in the family of Count Johann  Esterhazy. This meant that he must live with the family in their  Vienna home in winter, and go with them to their country seat in the  summer. The change from the free life he had enjoyed with his  friends who idolized him and his beautiful music, to the etiquette of  aristocratic life, was great. But there were many comforts amid his  new surroundings; the family was musical, the duties were not heavy,  and so Schubert was not unhappy.    At the Esterhazy country estate of Zelesz, he heard many Hungarian  melodies sung or played by the gipsies, or by servants in the castle.  He has employed some of these tunes in his first set of Valses. In  his present position he had much leisure for composition. Indeed Franz  Schubert's whole life was spent in giving out the vast treasures of  melody with which he had been so richly endowed. These flowed from his  pen in a constant stream, one beautiful work after another. He wrote  them down wherever he happened to be and when a scrap of paper could  be had. The exquisite song \"Hark, Hark the Lark\" was jotted down on  the back of a bill of fare, in a beer garden. The beautiful works  which he produced day after day brought him little or no money,  perhaps because he was so modest and retiring, modestly undervaluing  everything he did. He had no desire to push himself, but wrote because  impelled to by the urge within. So little did he sometimes value his  work that a fine composition would be tucked away somewhere and quite  forgotten. His physical strength was not robust enough to stand the  strain of constant composition. Then too, when funds were very low,  as they often were, he took poor lodgings, and denied himself the  necessary nourishing food. If he could have had a dear companion to  look after his material needs and share his aims and aspirations, his  earthly life might have been prolonged for many a year. With no one to  advise him, and often pressed with hunger and poverty, he was induced  to sell the copyrights of twelve of his best songs, including the  \"Erlking\" and the \"Wanderer,\" for a sum equal to about four"]]]
