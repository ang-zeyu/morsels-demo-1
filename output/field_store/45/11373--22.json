Then he made spells, then he flung up his arms; the fumes from the  cauldron entering in at his mind he said raging things that he had not  known before and runes that were dreadful (the acolyte screamed);  there he cursed London from fog to loam-pit, from zenith to the abyss,  motor-bus, factory, shop, parliament, people. \"Let them all perish,\"  he said, \"and London pass away, tram lines and bricks and pavement,  the usurpers too long of the fields, let them all pass away and the  wild hares come back, blackberry and briar-rose.\"    \"Let it pass,\" he said, \"pass now, pass utterly.\"    In the momentary silence the old man coughed, then waited with eager  eyes; and the long long hum of London hummed as it always has since  first the reed-huts were set up by the river, changing its note at  times but always humming, louder now than it was in years gone by, but  humming night and day though its voice be cracked with age; so it  hummed on.    And the old man turned him round to his trembling acolyte and terribly  said as he sank into the earth: \"YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT ME THE HEART  OF THE TOAD THAT DWELLETH IN ARABIA NOR BY THE MOUNTAINS OF BETHANY!\"            The Watch-tower    I sat one April in Provence on a small hill above an ancient town  that Goth and Vandal as yet have forborne to \"bring up to date.\"    On the hill was an old worn castle with a watch-tower, and a well with  narrow steps and water in it still.    The watch-tower, staring South with neglected windows, faced a broad  valley full of the pleasant twilight and the hum of evening things: it  saw the fires of wanderers blink from the hills, beyond them the long  forest black with pines, one star appearing, and darkness settling  slowly down on Var.    Sitting there listening to the green frogs croaking, hearing far  voices clearly but all transmuted by evening, watching the windows in  the little town glimmering one by one, and seeing the gloaming dwindle  solemnly into night, a great many things fell from mind that seem  important by day, and evening in their place planted strange fancies.    Little winds had arisen and were whispering to and fro, it grew cold,  and I was about to descend the hill, when I heard a voice behind me  saying, \"Beware, beware.\"    So much the voice appeared a part of the evening that I did not turn  round at first; it was like voices that one hears in sleep and thinks  to be of one's dream. And the word was monotonously repeated, in  French.    When I turned round I saw an old man with a horn. He had a white beard  marvellously long, and still went on saying slowly, \"Beware, beware.\"  He had clearly just come from the tower by which he stood, though I  had heard no footfall. Had a man come stealthily upon me at such an  hour and in so lonesome a place I had certainly felt surprised; but I  saw almost at once that he was a spirit, and he seemed with his  uncouth horn and his long white beard and that noiseless step of his  to be so native to that time and place that I spoke to him as one does  to some fellow-traveller who asks you if you mind having the window  up.    I asked him what there was to beware of.    \"Of what should a town beware,\" he said, \"but the Saracens?\"    \"Saracens?\" I said.    \"Yes, Saracens, Saracens,\" he answered and brandished his horn.    \"And who are you?\" I said.    \"I, I am the spirit of the tower,\" he said.    When I asked him how he came by so human an aspect and was so unlike  the material tower beside him he told me that the lives of all the  watchers who had ever held the horn in the tower there had gone to  make the spirit of the tower. \"It takes a hundred lives,\" he said.  \"None hold the horn of late and men neglect the tower. When the walls  are in ill repair the Saracens come: it was ever so.\"    \"The Saracens don't come nowadays,\" I said.    But he was gazing past me watching, and did not seem to heed me.    \"They will run down those hills,\" he said, pointing away to the South,  \"out of the woods about nightfall, and I shall blow my horn. The  people will all come up from the town to the tower again; but the  loopholes are in very ill repair.\"    \"We never hear of the Saracens now,\" I said.    \"Hear of the Saracens!\" the old spirit said. \"Hear of the Saracens!  They slip one evening out of that forest, in the long white robes that  they wear, and I blow my horn. That is the first that anyone ever  hears of the Saracens.\"    \"I mean,\" I said, \"that they never come at all. They cannot come and  men fear other things.\" For I thought the old spirit might rest if he  knew that the Saracens can never come again. But he said, \"There is  nothing in the world to fear but the Saracens. Nothing else matters.  How can men fear other things?\"    Then I explained, so that he might have rest, and told him how all  Europe, and in particular France, had terrible engines of war, both on  land and sea; and how the Saracens had not these terrible engines  either on sea or land, and so could by no means cross the  Mediterranean or escape destruction on shore even though they should  come there. I alluded to the European railways that could move armies  night and day faster than horses could gallop. And when as well as I  could I had explained all, he answered, \"In time all these things pass  away and then there will still be the Saracens.\"    And then I said, \"There has not been a Saracen either in France  or Spain for over four hundred years.\"    And he said, \"The Saracens! You do not know their cunning. That was  ever the way of the Saracens. They do not come for a while, no not  they, for a long while, and then one day they come.\"    And peering southwards, but not seeing clearly because of the rising  mist, he silently moved to his tower and up its broken steps.            How Plash-Goo Came to the Land of None's Desire    In a thatched cottage of enormous size, so vast that we might consider  it a palace, but only a cottage in the style of its building, its  timbers and the nature of its interior, there lived Plash-Goo.    Plash-Goo was of the children of the giants, whose sire was Uph. And  the lineage of Uph had dwindled in bulk for the last five hundred  years, till the giants were now no more than fifteen foot high; but  Uph ate elephants which he caught with his hands.    Now on the tops of the mountains above the house of Plash-Goo, for  Plash-Goo lived in the plains, there dwelt the dwarf whose name was  Lrippity-Kang. And the dwarf used to walk at evening on the edge of  the tops of the mountains, and would walk up and down along it, and  was squat and ugly and hairy, and was plainly seen of Plash-Goo.    And for many weeks the giant had suffered the sight of him, but at  length grew irked at the sight (as men are by little things), and  could not sleep of a night and lost his taste for pigs. And at last  there came the day, as anyone might have known, when Plash-Goo  shouldered his club and went up to look for the dwarf.    And the dwarf though briefly squat was broader than may be dreamed,  beyond all breadth of man, and stronger than men may know; strength in  its very essence dwelt in that little frame, as a spark in the heart  of a flint: but to Plash-Goo he was no more than mis-shapen, bearded  and squat, a thing that dared to defy all natural laws by being more  broad than long.    When Plash-Goo came to the mountain he cast his chimahalk down (for so  he named the club of his heart's desire) lest the dwarf should defy  him with nimbleness; and stepped towards Lrippity-Kang with gripping  hands, who stopped in his mountainous walk without a word, and swung  round his hideous breadth to confront Plash-Goo. Already then  Plash-Goo in the deeps of his mind had seen himself seize the dwarf in  one large hand and hurl him with his beard and his hated breadth sheer  down the precipice that dropped away from that very place to the land  of None's Desire. Yet it was otherwise that Fate would have it. For  the dwarf parried with his little arms the grip of those monstrous  hands, and gradually working along the enormous limbs came at length  to the giant's body where by dwarfish cunning he obtained a grip; and  turning Plash-Goo about, as a spider does some great fly, till his  little grip was suitable to his purpose, he suddenly lifted the giant  over his head. Slowly at first, by the edge of that precipice whose  base sheer distance hid, he swung his giant victim round his head, but  soon faster and faster; and at last when Plash-Goo was streaming round  the hated breadth of the dwarf and the no less hated beard was  flapping in the wind, Lrippity-Kang let go. Plash-Goo shot over the  edge and for some way further, out towards Space, like a stone; then  he began to fall. It was long before he believed and truly knew that  this was really he that fell from this mountain, for we do not  associate such dooms with ourselves; but when he had fallen for some  while through the evening and saw below him, where there had been  nothing to see, or began to see, the glimmer of tiny fields, then his  optimism departed; till later on when the fields were greener and  larger he saw that this was indeed (and growing now terribly nearer)  that very land to which he had destined the dwarf.    At last he saw it unmistakable, close, with its grim houses and its  dreadful ways, and its green fields shining in the light of the  evening. His cloak was streaming from him in whistling shreds.    So Plash-Goo came to the Land of None's Desire.            The Three Sailors' Gambit    Sitting some years ago in the ancient tavern at Over, one afternoon in  Spring, I was waiting, as was my custom, for something strange to  happen. In this I was not always disappointed for the very curious  leaded panes of that tavern, facing the sea, let a light into the  low-ceilinged room so mysterious, particularly at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#18)"],[1,"Emperor. Having  gained this prestige they promptly became acceptable to the rank and  file of people who vied with each other in their adoption. A  peculiarity of the Japanese is the readiness with which the ideas and  aims of the rulers are accepted by the people. This is due to the  nature of Japanese feudalism. It has made the body of the nation  conspicuously subject to the ruling brain and has conferred on Japan  her unique sensitiveness to environment.    Susceptibility to slight changes in the feelings of lords and masters  and corresponding flexibility were important social traits, necessary  products of the old social order. Those deficient in these regards  would inevitably lose in the struggle for social precedence, if not in  the actual struggle for existence. These characteristics would,  accordingly, be highly developed.    Bearing in mind, therefore, the character of the factors that have  ever been acting on the Japanese psychic nature, we see clearly that  the characteristics under consideration are not to be attributed to  her inherent race nature, but may be sufficiently accounted for by  reference to the social order and social environment.          VI    WAVES OF FEELING--ABDICATION      It has long been recognized that the Japanese are emotional, but the  full significance of this element of their nature is far from  realized. It underlies their entire life; it determines the mental  activities in a way and to a degree that Occidentals can hardly  appreciate. Waves of feeling have swept through the country, carrying  everything before them in a manner that has oftentimes amazed us of  foreign lands. An illustration from the recent political life of the  nation comes to mind in this connection. For months previous to the  outbreak of the recent war with China, there had been a prolonged  struggle between the Cabinet and the political parties who were united  in their opposition to the government, though in little else. The  parties insisted that the Cabinet should be responsible to the party  in power in the Lower House, as is the case in England, that thus they  might stand and fall together. The Cabinet, on the other hand,  contended that, according to the constitution, it was responsible to  the Emperor alone, and that consequently there was no need of a change  in the Cabinet with every change of party leadership. The nation waxed  hot over the discussion. Successive Diets were dissolved and new Diets  elected, in none of which, however, could the supporters of the  Cabinet secure a majority; the Cabinet was, therefore, incapable of  carrying out any of its distinctive measures. Several times the  opposition went so far as to decline to pass the budget proposed by  the Cabinet, unless so reduced as to cripple the government, the  reason constantly urged being that the Cabinet was not competent to  administer the expenditure of such large sums of money. There were no  direct charges of fraud, but simply of incompetence. More than once  the Cabinet was compelled to carry on the government during the year  under the budget of the previous year, as provided by the  constitution. So intense was the feeling that the capital was full of  \"soshi,\"--political ruffians,--and fear was entertained as to the  personal safety of the members of the Cabinet. The whole country was  intensely excited over the matter. The newspapers were not loath to  charge the government with extravagance, and a great explosion seemed  inevitable, when, suddenly, a breeze from a new quarter arose and  absolutely changed the face of the nation.    War with China was whispered, and then noised around. Events moved  rapidly. One or two successful encounters with the Chinese stirred the  warlike passion that lurked in every breast. At once the feud with the  Cabinet was forgotten. When, on short notice, an extra session of the  Diet was called to vote funds for a war, not a word was breathed about  lack of confidence in the Cabinet or its incompetence to manage the  ordinary expenditures of the government; on the contrary, within five  minutes from the introduction of the government bill asking a war  appropriation of 150,000,000 yen, the bill was unanimously passed.    Such an absolute change could hardly have taken place in England or  America, or any land less subject to waves of emotion. So far as I  could learn, the nation was a unit in regard to the war. There was not  the slightest sign of a \"peace party.\" Of all the Japanese with whom I  talked only one ever expressed the slightest opposition to the war,  and he on religious grounds, being a Quaker.    The strength of the emotional element tends to make the Japanese  extremists. If liberals, they are extremely liberal; if conservative,  they are extremely conservative. The craze for foreign goods and  customs which prevailed for several years in the early eighties was  replaced by an almost equally strong aversion to anything foreign.    This tendency to swing to extremes has cropped out not infrequently in  the theological thinking of Japanese Christians. Men who for years  had done effective work in upbuilding the Church, men who had lifted  hundreds of their fellow-countrymen out of moral and religious  darkness into light and life, have suddenly, as it has appeared, lost  all appreciation of the truths they had been teaching and have swung  off to the limits of a radical rationalism, losing with their  evangelical faith their power of helping their fellow-men, and in some  few cases, going over into lives of open sin. The intellectual reasons  given by them to account for their changes have seemed insufficient;  it will be found that the real explanation of these changes is to be  sought not in their intellectual, but in their emotional natures.    Care must be taken, however, not to over-emphasize this extremist  tendency. In some respects, I am convinced that it is more apparent  than real. The appearance is due to the silent passivity even of those  who are really opposed to the new departure. It is natural that the  advocates of some new policy should be enthusiastic and noisy. To give  the impression to an outsider that the new enthusiasm is universal,  those who do not share it have simply to keep quiet. This takes place  to some degree in every land, but particularly so in Japan. The  silence of their dissent is one of the striking characteristics of the  Japanese. It seems to be connected with an abdication of personal  responsibility. How often in the experience of the missionary it has  happened that his first knowledge of friction in a church, wholly  independent and self-supporting and having its own native pastor, is  the silent withdrawal of certain members from their customary places  of worship. On inquiry it is learned that certain things are being  done or said which do not suit them and, instead of seeking to have  these matters righted, they simply wash their hands of the whole  affair by silent withdrawal.    The Kumi-ai church, in Kumamoto, from being large and prosperous, fell  to an actual active membership of less than a dozen, solely because,  as each member became dissatisfied with the high-handed and radical  pastor, he simply withdrew. Had each one stood by the church,  realizing that he had a responsibility toward it which duty forbade  him to shirk, the conservative and substantial members of the church  would soon have been united in their opposition to the radical pastor  and, being in the majority, could have set matters right. In the case  of perversion of trust funds by the trustees of the Kumamoto School,  many Japanese felt that injustice was being done to the American Board  and a stain was being inflicted on Japan's fair name, but they did  nothing either to express their opinions or to modify the results. So  silent were they that we were tempted to think them either ignorant of  what was taking place, or else indifferent to it. We now know,  however, that many felt deeply on the matter, but were simply silent  according to the Japanese custom.    But silent dissent does not necessarily last indefinitely, though it  may continue for years. As soon as some check has been put upon the  rising tide of feeling, and a reaction is evident, those who before  had been silent begin to voice their reactionary feeling, while those  who shortly before had been in the ascendant begin to take their turn  of silent dissent. Thus the waves are accentuated, both in their rise  and in their relapse, by the abdicating proclivity of the people.    Yet, in spite of the tendency of the nation to be swept from one  extreme to another by alternate waves of feeling, there are many  well-balanced men who are not carried with the tide. The steady  progress made by the nation during the past generation, in spite of  emotional actions and reactions, must be largely attributed to the  presence in its midst of these more stable natures. These are the men  who have borne the responsibilities of government. So far as we are  able to see, they have not been led by their feelings, but rather by  their judgments. When the nation was wild with indignation over  Europe's interference with the treaty which brought the China-Japanese  war to a close, the men at the helm saw too clearly the futility of an  attempt to fight Russia to allow themselves to be carried away by  sentimental notions of patriotism. Theirs was a deeper and truer  patriotism than that of the great mass of the nation, who, flushed  with recent victories by land and by sea, were eager to give Russia  the thrashing which they felt quite able to administer.    Abdication is such an important element in Japanese life, serving to  throw responsibility on the young, and thus helping to emphasize the  emotional characteristics of the people, that we may well give it  further attention at this point. In describing it, I can do no better  than quote from J.H. Gubbins' valuable introduction to"]]]
