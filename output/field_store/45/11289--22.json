I have  elsewhere[17] examined into the pretensions of modern enlightenment,  as it is called, which looks with such contempt on all preceding ages;  I have shown that at bottom it is all small, superficial, and  unsubstantial. The pride of what has been called \"the existing  maturity of human intensity\" has come to a miserable end; and the  structures erected by those pedagogues of the human race have fallen  to pieces like the baby-houses of children.    With regard to the tone of society in Shakespeare's day, it is  necessary to remark that there is a wide difference between true  mental cultivation and what is called polish. That artificial polish  which puts an end to everything like free original communication and  subjects all intercourse to the insipid uniformity of certain rules,  was undoubtedly wholly unknown to the age of Shakespeare, as in a  great measure it still is at the present day in England. It possessed,  on the other hand, a fulness of healthy vigor, which showed itself  always with boldness, and sometimes also with coarseness. The spirit  of chivalry was not yet wholly extinct, and a queen, who was far more  jealous in exacting homage to her sex than to her throne, and who,  with her determination, wisdom, and magnanimity, was in fact well  qualified to inspire the minds of her subjects with an ardent  enthusiasm, inflamed that spirit to the noblest love of glory and  renown. The feudal independence also still survived in some measure;  the nobility vied with one another in splendor of dress and number of  retinue, and every great lord had a sort of small court of his own.  The distinction of ranks was as yet strongly marked--a state of things  ardently to be desired by the dramatic poet. In conversation they took  pleasure in quick and unexpected answers; and the witty sally passed  rapidly like a ball from mouth to mouth, till the merry game could no  longer be kept up. This, and the abuse of the play on words (of which  King James was himself very fond, and we need not therefore wonder at  the universality of the mode), may, doubtless, be considered as  instances of a bad taste; but to take them for symptoms of rudeness  and barbarity is not less absurd than to infer the poverty of a people  from their luxurious extravagance. These strained repartees are  frequently employed by Shakespeare, with the view of painting the  actual tone of the society in his day; it does not, however, follow  that they met with his approbation; on the contrary, it clearly  appears that he held them in derision. Hamlet says, in the scene with  the gravedigger, \"By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken  note of it: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant  comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe.\" And  Lorenzo, in the _Merchant of Venice_, alluding to Launcelot:      O dear discretion, how his words are suited!    The fool hath planted in his memory    An army of good words: and I do know    A many fools, that stand in better place,    Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word    Defy the matter.    Besides, Shakespeare, in a thousand places, lays great and marked  stress on a correct and refined tone of society, and lashes every  deviation from it, whether of boorishness or affected foppery; not  only does he give admirable discourses on it, but he represents it in  all its shades and modifications by rank, age, or sex. What foundation  is there, then, for the alleged barbarity of his age, its offences  against propriety? But if this is to be admitted as a test, then the  ages of Pericles and Augustus must also be described as rude and  uncultivated; for Aristophanes and Horace, who were both considered as  models of urbanity, display, at times, the coarsest indelicacy. On  this subject, the diversity in the moral feeling of ages depends on  other causes. Shakespeare, it is true, sometimes introduces us to  improper company; at others, he suffers ambiguous expressions to  escape in the presence of women, and even from women themselves. This  species of indelicacy was probably not then unusual. He certainly did  not indulge in it merely to please the multitude, for in many of his  pieces there is not the slightest trace of this sort to be found; and  in what virgin purity are many of his female parts worked out! When we  see the liberties taken by other dramatic poets in England in his  time, and even much later, we must account him comparatively chaste  and moral. Neither must we overlook certain circumstances in the  existing state of the theatre. The female parts were not acted by  women, but by boys; and no person of the fair sex appeared in the  theatre without a mask. Under such a carnival disguise, much might be  heard by them, and much might be ventured to be said in their  presence, which in other circumstances would have been absolutely  improper. It is certainly to be wished that decency should be observed  on all public occasions, and consequently also on the stage. But even  in this it is possible to go too far. That carping censoriousness  which scents out impurity in every bold sally, is, at best, but an  ambiguous criterion of purity of morals; and beneath this hypocritical  guise there often lurks the consciousness of an impure imagination.  The determination to tolerate nothing which has the least reference to  the sensual relation between the sexes, may be carried to a pitch  extremely oppressive to a dramatic poet and highly prejudicial to the  boldness and freedom of his compositions. If such considerations were  to be attended to, many of the happiest parts of Shakespeare's plays,  for example, in _Measure for Measure_, and _All's Well that Ends  Well_, which, nevertheless, are handled with a due regard to decency,  must be set aside as sinning against this would-be propriety.    Had no other monuments of the age of Elizabeth come down to us than  the works of Shakespeare, I should, from them alone, have formed the  most favorable idea of its state of social culture and enlightenment.  When those who look through such strange spectacles as to see nothing  in them but rudeness and barbarity cannot deny what I have now  historically proved, they are usually driven to this last resource,  and demand, \"What has Shakespeare to do with the mental culture of his  age? He had no share in it. Born in an inferior rank, ignorant and  uneducated, he passed his life in low society, and labored to please a  vulgar audience for his bread, without ever dreaming of fame or  posterity.\"    In all this there is not a single word of truth, though it has been  repeated a thousand times. It is true we know very little of the  poet's life; and what we do know consists for the most part of  raked-up and chiefly suspicious anecdotes, of about such a character  as those which are told at inns to inquisitive strangers who visit the  birthplace or neighborhood of a celebrated man. Within a very recent  period some original documents have been brought to light, and, among  them, his will, which give us a peep into his family concerns. It  betrays more than ordinary deficiency of critical acumen in  Shakespeare's commentators, that none of them, so far as we know, has  ever thought of availing himself of his sonnets for tracing the  circumstances of his life. These sonnets paint most unequivocally the  actual situation and sentiments of the poet; they make us acquainted  with the passions of the man; they even contain remarkable confessions  of his youthful errors. Shakespeare's father was a man of property,  whose ancestors had held the office of alderman and bailiff in  Stratford; and in a diploma from the Heralds' Office for the renewal  or confirmation of his coat of arms, he is styled _gentleman_. Our  poet, the oldest son but third child, could not, it is true, receive  an academic education, as he married when hardly eighteen, probably  from mere family considerations. This retired and unnoticed life he  continued to lead but a few years; and he was either enticed to London  from wearisomeness of his situation, or banished from home, as it is  said, in consequence of his irregularities. There he assumed the  profession of a player, which he considered at first as a degradation,  principally, perhaps, because of the wild excesses[18] into which he  was seduced by the example of his comrades. It is extremely probable  that the poetical fame which, in the progress of his career, he  afterward acquired, greatly contributed to ennoble the stage and to  bring the player's profession into better repute. Even at a very early  age he endeavored to distinguish himself as a poet in other walks than  those of the stage, as is proved by his juvenile poems of _Adonis and  Lucrece_. He quickly rose to be a sharer or joint proprietor, and also  manager, of the theatre for which he wrote. That he was not admitted  to the society of persons of distinction is altogether incredible. Not  to mention many others, he found a liberal friend and kind patron in  the Earl of Southampton, the friend of the unfortunate Essex. His  pieces were not only the delight of the great public, but also in  great favor at court; the two monarchs under whose reigns he wrote  were, according to the testimony of a contemporary, quite \"taken\" with  him.[19] Many plays were acted at court; and Elizabeth appears herself  to have commanded the writing of more than one to be acted at her  court festivals. King James, it is well known, honored Shakespeare so  far as to write to him with his own hand. All this looks very unlike  either contempt or banishment into the obscurity of a low circle. By  his labors as a poet, player, and stage-manager, Shakespeare acquired  a considerable property, which, in the last years of his too short  life, he enjoyed in his native town in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12083"],[0,"Eric; Or, Little (#18)"],[1,"at him ever since.\"    \"I noticed that he stayed in after all the rest last night,\" said  Barker.    \"Did he? By Jove, that looks bad.\"    \"Has any one charged him with it?\" asked Duncan.    \"Yes,\" answered one of the group: \"but he's as proud about it as  Lucifer, and is furious if you mention it to him. He says we ought to  know him better than to think him capable of such a thing.\"    \"And quite right, too,\" said Duncan. \"If he did it, he's done something  totally unlike what one would have believed possible of him.\"    The various items of evidence were put together, and certainly they  seemed to prove a strong case against Eric. In addition to the  probabilities already mentioned, it was found that the ink used was of a  violet color, and a peculiar kind, which Eric was known to patronise;  and not only so, but the wafers with which the paper had been attached  to the board were yellow, and exactly of the same size with some which  Eric was said to possess. How the latter facts had been discovered,  nobody exactly knew, but they began to be very generally whispered  throughout the school.    In short, the almost universal conviction among the boys proclaimed that  he was guilty, and many urged him to confess it at once, and save the  school from the threatened punishment. But he listened to such  suggestions with the most passionate indignation.    \"What!\" he said, angrily, \"tell a wilful lie to blacken my own innocent  character? Never!\"    The consequence was, they all began to shun him. Eric was put into  Coventry. Very few boys in the school still clung to him, and maintained  his innocence in spite of appearances, but they were the boys whom he  had most loved and valued, and they were most vigorous in his defence.  They were Russell, Montagu, Duncan, Owen, and little Wright.    On the evening of the Saturday, Upton had sought out Eric, and said in a  very serious tone, \"This is a bad business, Williams. I cannot forget  how you have been abusing Gordon lately, and though I won't believe you  guilty, yet you ought to explain.\"    \"What? even _you_, then suspect me?\" said Eric, bursting into proud  tears. \"Very well. I shan't condescend to _deny_ it. I won't speak to  you again till you have repented of mistrusting me;\" and he resolutely  rejected all further overtures on Upton's part.    He was alone in his misery. Some one, he perceived, had plotted to  destroy his character, and he saw too clearly how many causes of  suspicion told against him. But it was very bitter to think that the  whole school could so readily suppose that he would do a thing which  from his soul he abhorred. \"No,\" he thought, \"bad I may be, but I  _could_ not have done such a base and cowardly trick.\"    Never in his life had he been so wretched. He wandered alone to the  rocks, and watched the waves dashing against them with the rising tide.  The tumult of the weather seemed to relieve and console the tumult of  his heart. He drank in strength and defiance from the roar of the  waters, and climbed to their very edge along the rocks, where every  fresh, rush of the waves enveloped him in white swirls of angry loam.  The look of the green, rough, hungry sea, harmonised with his feelings,  and he sat down and stared into it, to find relief from the torment of  his thoughts.    At last, with a deep sigh, he turned away to go back, and meet the crowd  of suspicious and unkindly companions, and brood alone over his sorrow  in the midst of them. He had not gone many steps, when he caught sight  of Russell in the distance. His first impulse was to run away and  escape; but Russell determined to stop him, and when he came up, said,  \"Dear Eric, I have sought you out on purpose to tell you that _I_ don't  suspect you, and have never done so for a moment. I know you too well,  my boy, and be sure that _I_ will always stick to you, even if the whole  school cut you.\"    \"Oh, Edwin, I am _so_ wretched. I needn't tell you that I am quite  innocent of this. What have I done to be so suspected? Why, even your  cousin Upton won't believe me.\"    \"But he does, Eric,\" said Russell; \"he told me so just now, and several  others said the same thing.\"    A transient gleam passed over Eric's face.    \"O, I do so long for home again,\" he said. \"Except you, I have no  friend.\"    \"Don't say so, Eric. This cloud will soon blow over. Depend upon it, as  the Doctor said, we shall discover the offender yet, and the fellows  will soon make you reparation for their false suspicions. And you _have_  one friend, Eric,\" he continued, pointing reverently upwards.    Eric was overcome; he sat down on the grass and hid his face till the  tears flowed through his closed fingers. Russell sat silent and pitying  beside him, and let Eric's head rest upon his shoulder.    When they got home, Eric found three notes in his drawer. One was from  Mr. Gordon, and ran thus:--    \"I have little doubt, Williams, that you have done this act. Believe me,  I feel no anger, only pity for you. Come to me and confess, and I  promise, by every means in my power, to befriend and save you.\"    This note he read, and then, stamping on the floor, tore it up furiously  into twenty pieces, which he scattered about the room.    Another was from Mr. Rose;    \"Dear Eric--I _cannot, will_ not, believe you guilty, although  appearances look very black. You have many faults, but I feel sure that  I cannot be mistaken in supposing you too noble-minded for a revenge so  petty and so mean. Come to me, dear boy, if I can help you in any way. I  _trust you_, Eric, and will use every endeavor to right you in the  general estimation. You are innocent; pray to God for help under this  cruel trial, and be sure that your character will yet be  cleared.--Affectionately yours, WALTER ROSE.\"    \"_P.S._--I can easily understand that just now you will like quiet; come  and sit with me in the library as much as you like.\"    He read this note two or three times with grateful emotion, and at that  moment would have died for Mr. Rose. The third note was from Owen, as  follows:--    \"Dear Williams--We have been cool to each other lately; naturally,  perhaps. But yet I think that it will be some consolation to you to be  told, even by a rival, that I, for one, feel certain of your innocence.  If you want company, I shall be delighted now to walk with you.--Yours  truly, D. OWEN.\"    This note, too, brought much comfort to the poor boy's lonely and  passionate heart. He put it into his pocket, and determined at once to  accept Mr. Rose's kind offer of allowing him to sit for the present in  the library.    There were several boys in the room while he was reading his notes, but  none of them spoke to him, and he was too proud to notice them, or  interrupt the constrained silence. As he went out he met Duncan and  Montagu, who at once addressed him in the hearing of the rest.    \"Ha! Williams,\" said Duncan, \"we have been looking everywhere for you,  dear fellow. Cheer up, you shall be cleared yet. I, for one, and Monty  for another, will maintain your innocence before the whole school.\"    Montagu _said_ nothing, but Eric understood full well the trustful  kindness of his soft pressure of the hand. His heart was too full to  speak, and he went on towards the library.    \"I wonder at your speaking to that fellow,\" said Bull, as the two new  comers joined the group at the fire-place.    \"You will be yourself ashamed of having ever suspected him before long,\"  said Montagu warmly; \"ay, the whole lot of you; and you are very unkind  to condemn him before you are certain.\"    \"I wish you joy of your _friend_, Duncan,\" sneered Barker.    \"Friend?\" said Duncan, firing up; \"yes! he is my friend, and I'm not  ashamed of him. It would be well for the school if _all_ the fellows  were as honorable as Williams.\"    Barker took the hint, and although he was too brazen to blush, thought  it better to say no more.        CHAPTER XII    THE TRIAL    \"A plot, a plot, a plot, to ruin all.\" TENNYSON, _The Princess_.    On the Monday evening, the head boy reported to Dr. Rowlands that the  perpetrator of the offence had not been discovered, but that one boy was  very generally suspected, and on grounds that seemed plausible. \"I  admit,\" he added, \"that from the little I know of him he seems to me a  very unlikely sort of boy to do it.\"    \"I think,\" suggested the Doctor, \"that the best way would be for you to  have a regular trial on the subject, and hear the evidence. Do you think  that you can be trusted to carry on the investigation publicly, with  good order and fairness?\"    \"I think so, sir,\" said Avonley.    \"Very well. Put up a notice, asking all the school to meet by themselves  in the boarders' room tomorrow afternoon at three, and see what you can  do among you.\"    Avonley did as the Doctor suggested. At first, when the boys assembled,  they seemed inclined to treat the matter as a joke, and were rather  disorderly; but Avonley briefly begged them, if they determined to have  a trial, to see that it was conducted sensibly; and by general consent  he was himself voted into the desk as president. He then got up  and said--    \"There must be no sham or nonsense about this affair. Let all the boys  take their seats quietly down the room.\"    They did so, and Avonley asked, \"Is Williams here?\"    Looking round, they discovered he was not. Russell instantly went to the  library to fetch him, and told him what was going on. He took Eric's arm  kindly as they entered, to show the whole school that he was not ashamed  of him, and Eric deeply felt the delicacy of his goodwill.    \"Are you willing to be tried, Williams,\" asked Avonley, \"on the charge  of having written the insulting paper about Mr. Gordon? Of course we  know very little how these kind of things ought to be conducted, but we  will see that everything done is open and above ground, and try to  manage it properly.\"    \"There is nothing I should like better,\" said"]]]
