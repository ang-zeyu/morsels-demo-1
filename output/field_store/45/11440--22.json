This step looked exceedingly hard, but what else could the poor fellow  do? Slavery existed expressly for the purpose of crushing souls and  breaking tender hearts.             *       *       *       *       *          WILLIAM DAVIS.      William might be described as a good-looking mulatto, thirty-one years  of age, and capable of thinking for himself. He made no grave complaints  of ill-usage under his master, \"Joseph Reynolds,\" who lived at Newton,  Portsmouth, Va. However, his owner had occasionally \"threatened to sell  him.\" As this was too much for William's sensitive feelings, he took  umbrage at it and made a hasty and hazardous move, which resulted in  finding himself on the U.G.R.R. The most serious regret William had to  report to the Committee was, that he was compelled to \"leave\" his  \"wife,\" Catharine, and his little daughter, Louisa, two years and one  month, and an infant son seven months old. He evidently loved them very  tenderly, but saw no way by which he could aid them, as long as he was  daily liable to be put on the auction block and sold far South. This  argument was regarded by the Committee as logical and unanswerable;  consequently they readily endorsed his course, while they deeply  sympathized with his poor wife and little ones. \"Before escaping,\" he  \"dared not\" even apprise his wife and child, whom he had to leave behind  in the prison house.             *       *       *       *       *          JOSEPH HENRY CAMP.      THE AUCTION BLOCK IS DEFEATED AND A SLAVE TRADER LOSES FOURTEEN HUNDRED  DOLLARS.      In November, 1853, in the twentieth year of his age, Camp was held to  \"service or labor\" in the City of Richmond, Va., by Dr. K. Clark. Being  uncommonly smart and quite good-looking at the same time, he was a  saleable piece of merchandise. Without consulting his view of the matter  or making the least intimation of any change, the master one day struck  up a bargain with a trader for Joseph, and received _Fourteen Hundred  Dollars cash_ in consideration thereof. Mr. Robert Parrett, of Parson &  King's Express office, happened to have a knowledge of what had  transpired, and thinking pretty well of Joseph, confidentially put him  in full possession of all the facts in the case. For reflection he  hardly had five minutes. But he at once resolved to strike that day for  freedom--not to go home that evening to be delivered into the hands of  his new master. In putting into execution his bold resolve, he secreted  himself, and so remained for three weeks. In the meantime his mother,  who was a slave, resolved to escape also, but after one week's gloomy  foreboding, she became \"faint-hearted and gave the struggle over.\" But  Joseph did not know what surrender meant. His sole thought was to  procure a ticket on the U.G.R.R. for Canada, which by persistent effort  he succeeded in doing. He hid himself in a steamer, and by this way  reached Philadelphia, where he received every accommodation at the usual  depot, was provided with a free ticket, and sent off rejoicing for  Canada. The unfortunate mother was \"detected and sold South.\"             *       *       *       *       *          SHERIDAN FORD.      SECRETED IN THE WOODS--ESCAPES IN A STEAMER.      About the twenty-ninth of January, 1855, Sheridan arrived from the Old  Dominion and a life of bondage, and was welcomed cordially by the  Vigilance Committee. Miss Elizabeth Brown of Portsmouth, Va. claimed  Sheridan as her property. He spoke rather kindly of her, and felt that  he \"had not been used very hard\" as a general thing, although, he wisely  added, \"the best usage was bad enough.\" Sheridan had nearly reached his  twenty-eighth year, was tall and well made, and possessed of a  considerable share of intelligence.    Not a great while before making up his mind to escape, for some trifling  offence he had been \"stretched up with a rope by his hands,\" and  \"whipped unmercifully.\" In addition to this he had \"got wind of the  fact,\" that he was to be auctioneered off; soon these things brought  serious reflections to Sheridan's mind, and among other questions, he  began to ponder how he could get a ticket on the U.G.R.R., and get out  of this \"place of torment,\" to where he might have the benefit of his  own labor. In this state of mind, about the fourteenth day of November,  he took his first and daring step. He went not, however, to learned  lawyers or able ministers of the Gospel in his distress and trouble, but  wended his way \"directly to the woods,\" where he felt that he would be  safer with the wild animals and reptiles, in solitude, than with the  barbarous civilization that existed in Portsmouth.    The first day in the woods he passed in prayer incessantly, all alone.  In this particular place of seclusion he remained \"four days and  nights,\" \"two days suffered severely from hunger, cold and thirst.\"  However, one who was a \"friend\" to him, and knew of his whereabouts,  managed to get some food to him and consoling words; but at the end of  the four days this friend got into some difficulty and thus Sheridan was  left to \"wade through deep waters and head winds\" in an almost hopeless  state. There he could not consent to stay and starve to death.  Accordingly he left and found another place of seclusion--with a friend  in the town--for a pecuniary consideration. A secret passage was  procured for him on one of the steamers running between Philadelphia and  Richmond, Va. When he left his poor wife, Julia, she was then \"lying in  prison to be sold,\" on the simple charge of having been suspected of  conniving at her husband's escape. As a woman she had known something of  the \"barbarism of slavery\", from every-day experience, which the large  scars about her head indicated--according to Sheridan's testimony. She  was the mother of two children, but had never been allowed to have the  care of either of them. The husband, utterly powerless to offer her the  least sympathy in word or deed, left this dark habitation of cruelty, as  above referred to, with no hope of ever seeing wife or child again in  this world.    The Committee afforded him the usual aid and comfort, and passed him on  to the next station, with his face set towards Boston. He had heard the  slaveholders \"curse\" Boston so much, that he concluded it must be a  pretty safe place for the fugitive.             *       *       *       *       *          JOSEPH KNEELAND, ALIAS JOSEPH HULSON.      Joseph Kneeland arrived November 25, 1853. He was a prepossessing man of  twenty-six, dark complexion, and intelligent. At the time of Joseph's  escape, he was owned by Jacob Kneeland, who had fallen heir to him as a  part of his father's estate. Joseph spoke of his old master as having  treated him \"pretty well,\" but he had an idea that his young master had  a very \"malignant spirit;\" for even before the death of his old master,  the heir wanted him, \"Joe,\" sold, and after the old man died, matters  appeared to be coming to a crisis very fast. Even as early as November,  the young despot had distinctly given \"Joe\" to understand, that he was  not to be hired out another year, intimating that he was to \"go  somewhere,\" but as to particulars, it was time enough for Joe to know  them.    Of course \"Joe\" looked at his master \"right good\" and saw right through  him, and at the same time, saw the U.G.R.R., \"darkly.\" Daily slavery  grew awfully mean, but on the other hand, Canada was looked upon as a  very desirable country to emigrate to, and he concluded to make his way  there, as speedily as the U.G.R.R. could safely convey him. Accordingly  he soon carried his design into practice, and on his arrival, the  Committee regarded him as a very good subject for her British Majesty's  possessions in Canada.             *       *       *       *       *          EX-PRESIDENT TYLER'S HOUSEHOLD LOSES AN ARISTOCRATIC \"ARTICLE.\"      James Hambleton Christian is a remarkable specimen of the \"well fed,  &c.\" In talking with him relative to his life as a slave, he said very  promptly, \"I have always been treated well; if I only have half as good  times in the North as I have had in the South, I shall be perfectly  satisfied. Any time I desired spending money, five or ten dollars were  no object.\" At times, James had borrowed of his master, one, two, and  three hundred dollars, to loan out to some of his friends. With regard  to apparel and jewelry, he had worn the best, as an every-day adornment.  With regard to food also, he had fared as well as heart could wish, with  abundance of leisure time at his command. His deportment was certainly  very refined and gentlemanly. About fifty per cent. of Anglo-Saxon blood  was visible in his features and his hair, which gave him no  inconsiderable claim to sympathy and care. He had been to William and  Mary's College in his younger days, to wait on young master James B.C.,  where, through the kindness of some of the students he had picked up a  trifling amount of book learning. To be brief, this man was born the  slave of old Major Christian, on the Glen Plantation, Charles City  county, Va. The Christians were wealthy and owned many slaves, and  belonged in reality to the F.F.V's. On the death of the old Major, James  fell into the hands of his son, Judge Christian, who was executor to his  father's estate. Subsequently he fell into the hands of one of the  Judge's sisters, Mrs. John Tyler (wife of Ex-President Tyler), and then  he became a member of the President's domestic household, was at the  White House, under the President, from 1841 to 1845. Though but very  young at that time, James was only fit for training in the arts,  science, and mystery of waiting, in which profession, much pains were  taken to qualify him completely for his calling.

He jumped  on me out of the bushes. He will eat me!\"    \"He shall never do that!\" cried the rabbit, bravely. \"I will save you.\" So  he ran up to that snake, but the snake stuck out his tongue, like a fork,  at the rabbit, and Uncle Wiggily was frightened. Then he tried to hit the  snake with a stick, but the crawly creature hid down behind Grandfather  Goosey, and so got out of the way.    \"I have it!\" suddenly cried Uncle Wiggily. \"The popcorn balls. Snakes love  them! I'll make him eat them, and then he'll let Grandpa Goosey go.\" So  from his valise the brave rabbit took the red and the white and the  chocolate colored popcorn balls, and he rolled them along the ground,  close to the snake's nose. And the snake smelled them, and he was so  hungry for them that he uncoiled himself from Grandfather Goosey's legs,  and let the old gentleman duck go. And the snake chased after the corn  balls and ate them all up, and then he didn't want anything more for a  long while, and he went to sleep for six months and dreamed about turning  into a hoop, and so he didn't bother anybody.    So that's how Uncle Wiggily saved the duck, and next, in case the pretty  baby across the street doesn't fall down and bump its nose, I'll tell you  about Uncle Wiggily and the ice cream cones.          STORY XXVI    UNCLE WIGGILY'S ICE CREAM CONES      It didn't take Uncle Wiggily and Grandfather Goosey Gander long to get  away from the place where the bad snake was, let me tell you, even if the  crawly creature had eaten three popcorn balls, and would sleep for six  months.    \"This is no place for us,\" said the rabbit. \"We must see if we can't find  our fortune somewhere else.\"    \"I believe you,\" spoke Grandfather Goosey, rubbing his yellow legs, where  the snake had wound tight around him like a clothesline. \"We'll look for a  place in which to stay to-night, and we'll see what we can find  to-morrow.\"    Well, they hurried on for some time, and pretty soon it began to get dark,  and they couldn't find any place to stay.    \"I guess I'll have to dig a hole in the ground, and make a burrow,\" said  the rabbit.    \"Oh, but I couldn't stay underground,\" said the duck. \"I'm used to  sleeping in a wooden house.\"    \"That's so,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"Well, if I had some paper I could make  you a paper house, but I haven't any, so I don't know what to do.\"    And just then, away in the air, there sounded a voice saying:    \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\"    \"Ha! That's a crow,\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"There must be green corn  that is ready to pull up somewhere around here.\"    \"There is,\" said the black crow, flying down. \"I know a nice field of corn  that a farmer has planted, and to-morrow I am going to pick some.\"    \"But aren't you afraid of the scarecrow?\" asked the duck.    \"No; I'm not,\" said the crow. \"The scarecrow is only some old clothes  stuffed with straw, and it is set out in the field to drive us crows away.  We're not a bit afraid of it. Would you be?\"    \"No, of course not,\" answered Grandfather Goosey Gander. \"But then, you  see, I'm not a crow--the scary figure wasn't meant for me.\"    \"Then you can stay in one of the pockets of the scarecrow's coat all  night,\" said the crow. \"It will be a good place for you to sleep.\"    \"The very thing!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. So that night he dug himself a  little house under the ground, and the duck gentleman flew up, and got  inside the pocket of the old coat which the scarecrow figure wore, and  there the duck stayed all night, sleeping very soundly.    \"Well, now we'll travel on again,\" said Uncle Wiggily, the next morning  after breakfast. So he and Grandfather Goosey started off. Well, pretty  soon it became hotter and hotter, for the sun was just beaming down as  hard as it could, and Uncle Wiggily exclaimed:    \"I know what would taste good! An ice cream cone for each of us. Wait  here, grandfather, and I'll get two of them.\"    \"Fine!\" cried the grandfather duck. \"But you seem to do all the hopping  around, Uncle Wiggily. Why can't I go, while you rest?\"    \"Oh, I don't in the least mind going,\" replied the kind rabbit. \"Besides,  while I do not say it to be proud, and far be it from me to boast, I can  go a little faster than you can in one hop. So I'll go.\"    And go he did, leaving his valise in charge of Grandfather Goosey, who sat  down with it, under a shady tree. Pretty soon the old gentleman rabbit  came to a little ice cream store, that stood beside the road, right near a  little pond of water, where the ice-cream-man could wash his dishes when  he had to make them clean.    \"I'll have two, nice, big, cold strawberry ice cream cones, and please put  plenty of ice cream in them,\" said Uncle Wiggily to the man.    \"Right you are!\" cried the ice-cream-man in a jolly voice, and, say, I  just wish you could have seen those cones! They were piled up heaping full  of ice cream. Oh, my! It just makes me hungry to write about them.    Well, Uncle Wiggily, carefully carrying the cones, started to hop back to  where he had left Grandfather Goosey. He hadn't gone far before he heard a  growling voice cry out:    \"Hold on there a moment, Uncle Wiggily!\"    \"Why?\" asked the rabbit.    \"Because I want to see what you've got,\" was the answer. \"Ah, I see ice  cream cones!\" and with that a great, big, black bear jumped out of the  bushes, and stood right in front of Uncle Wiggily.    \"Let me pass!\" cried the rabbit, holding the ice cream cones so that the  bear couldn't get them.    \"Indeed I will not!\" cried the furry creature. \"Ice cream cones, indeed!  If there is one thing that I'm fonder of than another, ice cream cones is  it! Let me taste one!\"    Then before the rabbit could do anything, that bad bear took one ice cream  cone right away from him. And that bear did more than that, so he did. He  stuck his long, red tongue down inside the cone, and he licked out every  bit of cream, with one, long lick.    \"My but that's good!\" he cried, smacking his lips. \"I guess I'll try the  second one,\" he said, and he dropped the empty cone, not eating it, mind  you, and he took the other full cone away from poor Uncle Wiggily before  the rabbit gentleman could stand on his head, or even wave his short tail.    \"Oh, don't eat that cone. It belongs to Grandfather Goosey,\" cried the  rabbit, sadly-like.    \"Too late!\" cried the bear, in a growlery voice. \"Here it goes!\" and with  that he stuck his long, red tongue down inside the second cone, and with  one lick he licked all the ice cream out and threw the empty cone on the  ground.    \"Now I feel good and hungry, and I guess I'll eat you,\" cried the bear. He  made a grab for the poor gentleman rabbit, and folded him tight in his  paws. But before that Uncle Wiggily had reached down and had picked up the  two empty ice cream cones.    \"Oh, let me go!\" cried Uncle Wiggily to the bear.    \"Indeed I'll not!\" shouted the savage creature. \"I want you for supper.\"    Well, he was just going to eat Uncle Wiggily up, when that brave rabbit  just took the sharp points of those two empty ice cream cones, and he  stuck them in the bear's ticklish ribs, and Uncle Wiggily tickled the bear  so that the furry, savage creature sneezed out loud, and laughed so hard  that Uncle Wiggily easily slipped out of his paws, and hopped away before  he could be caught again.    So that's how the rabbit got safely away, and the empty ice cream cones  were of some use after all. But Uncle Wiggily wondered how he could get a  full one for Grandfather Goosey Gander, and how he did I'll tell you  pretty soon, when, in case a butterfly doesn't bite a hole in my straw  hat, the next story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the red ants.          STORY XXVII    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED ANTS      When Uncle Wiggily got to where Grandfather Goosey Gander was waiting for  him, under the shady tree, the old gentleman duck jumped up and cried out:    \"Oh, how glad I am to see you! I've just been wishing you would hurry back  with those ice cream cones. My! I never knew the weather to be so warm at  this time of the year. Oh, won't they taste most delicious--those cones!\"    You see he didn't yet know what the bear had done--eaten all the ice cream  out of the cones, as I told you in the other story.    \"Oh, dear!\" cried the rabbit. \"How sorry I am to have to disappoint you,  Grandfather, but there is no ice cream!\"    \"No ice cream!\" cried the alligator--oh, dear me! I mean the duck. \"No ice  cream?\"    \"Not a bit,\" said Uncle Wiggily, and then he told about what the savage  bear-creature had done, and also how he had used the cones to tickle him.    \"Well, that's too bad,\" said Grandfather Goosey, \"but here, I'll give you  money to buy more cones with,\" and he put his hand in his pocket, but lo  and behold! he had lost all his money.    \"Never mind, perhaps _I_ have some pennies,\" said the rabbit; so he  looked, but, oh, dear me, suz-dud and the mustard pot! All of Uncle  Wiggily's money was gone, too.    \"Well, I guess we can't get any ice cream cones this week,\" said the old  gentleman duck. \"We'll have to drink water.\"    \"Oh, no you won't,\" said a buzzing voice. \"I'll get you each an ice cream  cone, because you have always been so kind--both of you.\" And with that  out from the bushes flew a big, sweet, honey bee, with a load of honey.    \"Have you got any ice cream cones, Mr. Bee?\" asked the rabbit.    \"No, but I have sweet honey, and if I go down to the ice cream cone store,  and give the man some of my honey he'll give me three cones, and there'll  be one for you and one for me and----\"    \"One for Sister Sallie!\" interrupted Grandfather Goosey. \"I wish she was  here now.\"    \"She could have a cone if she was here,\" said the honey bee, \"as I could  get four. But, as long as she is not, the extra cone will go to you,  Grandpa. Now, come on, and I'll take my honey to the ice-cream-cone-man.\"    So they went with him and on the way the bee sung a funny little song like  this:"]]]
