And even if you can succeed in painting something which  scarcely can be said to resemble a rose, of what advantage is it, when  we have so many real roses to admire?    My dear ladies, I warn you, generally, do not be afraid of the  so-called classical, heavy music, especially Beethoven's, if you desire  to learn from it, only or chiefly, repose, lightness, facility,  elasticity, graceful, delicate playing, and a fine touch. It is  necessary to play such music after those brilliant qualities have  already been, to a certain degree, acquired by mere studies and  appropriate pieces. It is, however, still more foolish and impractical,  when parents (who perhaps are skilful musicians, but who have no  recollection of their own youth) hold the mistaken opinion that their  children ought, from the very beginning, to practise and play only fine  classical music, in order that the children's ears may not be injured by  false progressions, by insignificant finger exercises, and by easily  comprehensible Italian airs, and that they themselves may not be ruined  body and soul. Gracious heavens! how much pure music, suited to the  piano, have not my daughters, as well as many others whom I have brought  up to be fine performers, played and studied!--such, for instance, as  the music of Huenten, Czerny, Burgmueller, Kalkbrenner, A. and J. Schmitt,  Herz, and many others. Who finds fault now with their musical culture,  with their sound taste, or their want of love for classical music? What  a long road a child has to travel through Etudes of Cramer, Moscheles,  and Chopin, before he comes to Bach's Well-tempered Clavichord, or  before he is able, or ought even, to study Beethoven's Sonate  Pathetique! It is not well, though quite in the spirit of the times, to  condemn without experience, from one's own prejudiced point of view, the  methods which those skilled in their business have for years  successfully tried and practised. It is possible to make pupils musical  in the above way, but they will be only dull, clumsy bunglers on the  piano; not fine artists, who alone can give a worthy and noble  interpretation of classical music. I desire that my daughters may never  forget my well-considered instructions, sustained by the experience of  many years; and that they may, in grateful remembrance of their father  and teacher, repay to their pupils what they owe to him.    But I see among my audience several beginners in singing, and I beg to  be allowed a word to them. So long as many of our German song composers  consider it beneath their dignity to study the art of singing in the old  Italian master-works, and under the guidance of well-qualified singing  masters,--as Gluck, Naumann, Hasse, Haendel, Haydn, Mozart, Salieri,  Winter, and others have done,--I warn you to take care of your tender  voices, which are so easily ruined, and not to allow yourselves to be  misled by ingenious opinions, and by music otherwise good. The loss of  your voices follows in the footsteps of modern tortures in singing, as  you may see sufficiently in all our theatres, or, indeed, may experience  yourselves in numberless German songs. Apply also to singing what I have  just said about piano-playing: as you should choose for the piano music  suited to the piano, so for your studies in singing select only that  which is adapted to the voice; under the guidance of prudent and  educated teachers, not of modern voice breakers, who allow you to  scream, \"in order to bring out the voice.\" When you have acquired a good  technique, when your attack is sure, and a certain skilfulness in  singing has been developed, then only you may try, by way of experiment,  a few pieces of such spirited but unskilled song composers, who  frequently commit sins in every line against correct representation, the  register of the voice, the breathings, the pronunciation, and a hundred  other things.    Look around and see who sing these so-called classical songs. They are  either singers who do not know what singing is, and who have no taste  for it, which, in consequence of their education, they never can have;  or those who no longer have any voice, and accordingly sing every thing,  or, rather, declaim it, because they cannot sing. I recommend you to  sing (to mention the names of two only of our most excellent song  composers) the charming songs of Fr. Schubert and Mendelssohn, who, in  constant intercourse with the most judicious masters of singing in  Vienna and Italy, have striven constantly to compose scientifically, and  have at the same time produced clever songs; but you should sing them  not too often, or too many of them. Singing in the German language, and  in syllables, and often with clumsy melodies, requires a great deal of  voice, and easily leads to many faults and to a false manner. Remember  how strictly Jenny Lind selected, for performance in her concerts, the  songs of Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Schumann. In this way she succeeded  in winning great success, even with small, short songs.    Finally, one more secret for performers, which weighs heavy in the  balance. You ought, especially if you have not received good early  instruction, to acquire a habit of moving the fingers very frequently,  at every convenient opportunity; and particularly of letting them fall  loosely and lightly upon any hard object, while the hand lies upon  something firm, in an extended position.    You must accustom yourselves to do this unconsciously. For example,  while reading, at table, or while listening to music, allow your hand to  lie upon the table, raise the fingers, and let them fall, one at a time,  quite independently of the wrist; particularly the weak fourth and fifth  fingers, which require to be used a hundred times more than the others,  if you wish to acquire evenness in the scales. If it attracts attention  to do this on the table, then do it in your lap, or with one hand over  the other. To drum with your fingers and stretch your hands on the backs  of other people is not often practicable, and is not necessary. That was  only pardoned in the zealous and original Adolph Henselt, who, though  otherwise such a modest and amiable artist, even now, in St. Petersburg,  makes himself ridiculous in this way, by his practice of finger  movements.    Now you perceive the reason why I cannot answer the question which has  been asked me innumerable times. How much do your daughters practise? I  cannot count up the finger movements and the stray ten minutes just  spoken of; but it is certain that they practise fewer hours in the day  than many thousands who learn nothing, for they never practise and  never have practised wrongly, but always correctly and advantageously.    One thing more. After my experienced, watchful eye had observed in our  circle many moving fingers in consequence of my lecture, a distinguished  lady of Vienna whispered in my ear: \"But, my dear Herr Wieck, my Amelia  is not to be a professional player: I only want her to learn a few of  the less difficult sonatas of Beethoven, to play correctly and fluently,  without notes.\" My dear ladies, I do not aim with you at any thing more  than this. A great many circumstances must combine for the formation of  fine concert performers; in fact, the whole education, from the earliest  youth, must have reference to this end. If this were not so, Germany  especially, on account of its natural musical talent, would be able  annually to furnish thousands of _virtuoso_ performers.    Has my lecture been too long to-day? I ask your pardon. My desire to  make myself useful to you must be my excuse, if I cannot dispose of such  an extensive subject in a few words. I have not yet exhausted it.          CHAPTER XII.    THOUGHTS ON PIANO-PLAYING.      My daughters play the music of all the principal composers, and also the  best salon music. Limited views of any kind are injurious to art. It is  as great a mistake to play only Beethoven's music as to play none of it,  or to play either classical or salon music solely. If a teacher confines  himself to the study of the first, a good technique, a tolerably sound  style of playing, intelligence, and knowledge are generally sufficient  to produce an interpretation in most respects satisfactory. The music  usually compensates for a style which may be, according to  circumstances, either dry, cold, too monotonous or too strongly shaded,  and even for an indifferent or careless touch. Interest in the  composition frequently diverts the attention of even the best player  from a thoroughly correct and delicate mode of execution, and from the  effort to enhance the beauty of the composition, and to increase its  appreciation with the hearer. In the performance of classical music,  inspiration--that is, the revelation of an artistic nature and not  empty affectation--can be expected only from an artist, and not from a  pupil. Therefore, with more advanced pupils, I take up in my lessons, in  connection with a sonata by Beethoven, a nocturne or waltz by Chopin,  and a piece by St. Heller or Schulhoff, Henselt, C. Meyer, &c. Elegance  and polish, a certain coquetry, nicety, delicacy, and fine shading  cannot be perfected in the study of a sonata by Beethoven; for which,  however, the latter pieces present much greater opportunities. Besides  this, variety is much more sustaining to the learner; it excites his  interest; he does not so soon become weary, and is guarded from  carelessness; his artistic knowledge is increased, and he is agreeably  surprised to find himself able to perform three pieces so distinct in  character.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Expression cannot be taught, it must come of itself.\" But when are we  to look for it?

Instead of farms and vineyards, there were great bare spaces  of land, where sheep, kids, or goats were feeding. These vast tracts  belonged to Romans, who kept slaves to attend to the flocks; while all  the corn that was used in Rome came from Sicily or Africa, and the  poorer Romans lived in the city itself--idle men, chiefly trusting to  distributions of corn, and unable to work for themselves because they  had no ground to till; and as to trades and handicrafts, the rich men  had everything they wanted made in their own houses by their slaves.    [Illustration: CORNELIA AND HER SONS.]    No wonder the Romans were losing their old character. This was the very  thing that the Licinian law had been intended to prevent, by forbidding  any citizen to have more than a certain quantity of land, and giving the  state the power of resuming it. The law was still there, but it had  been disused and forgotten; estates had been gathered into the hands of  families and handed down, till now, though there were 400,000 citizens,  only 2,000 were men of property.    While Tiberius was serving in Spain, he decided on his plan. As his  family was plebeian, he could be a tribune of the people, and as soon as  he came home he stood and was elected. Then he proposed reviving the  Licinian law, that nobody should have more than 500 acres, and that the  rest should be divided among those who had nothing, leaving, however, a  larger portion to those who had many children.    There was, of course, a terrible uproar; the populace clamoring for  their rights, and the rich trying to stop the measure. They bribed one  of the other tribunes to forbid it; but there was a fight, in which  Tiberius prevailed, and he and his young brother Caius, and his  father-in-law Appius Claudius, were appointed as triumvers to see the  law carried out. Then the rich men followed their old plan of spreading  reports among the people that Tiberius wanted to make himself a king,  and had accepted a crown and purple robe from some foreign envoy. When  his year of office was coming to an end, he sought to be elected tribune  again, but the patricians said it was against the law. There was a  great tumult, in the course of which he put his hand to his head, either  to guard it from a blow or to beckon his friends. \"He demands the  diadem,\" shouted his enemies, and there was a great struggle, in which  three hundred people were killed. Tiberius tried to take refuge in the  Temple of Jupiter, but the doors were closed against him; he stumbled,  was knocked down with a club, and killed.    However, the Sempronian law had been made, and the people wanted, of  course, to have it carried out, while the nobles wanted it to be a dead  letter. Scipio AEmilianus, the brother-in-law of the Gracchi, had been in  Spain all this time, but he had so much disapproved of Tiberius' doings  that he was said to have exclaimed, on hearing of his death, \"So perish  all who do the like.\" But when he came home, he did so much to calm and  quiet matters, that there was a cry to make him Dictator, and let him  settle the whole matter. Young Caius Gracchus, who thought the cause  would thus be lost, tried to prevent the choice by fixing on him the  name of tyrant. To which Scipio calmly replied, \"Rome's enemies may well  wish me dead, for they know that while I live Rome cannot perish.\"    When he went home, he shut himself into his room to prepare his  discourse for the next day, but in the morning he was found dead,  without a wound, though his slaves declared he had been murdered. Some  suspected his wife Sempronia, others even her mother Cornelia, but the  Senate would not have the matter enquired into. He left no child, and  the Africanus line of Cornelius ended with him.    Caius Gracchus was nine years younger than his brother, and was elected  tribune as soon as he was old enough. He was full of still greater  schemes than his brother. His mother besought him to be warned by his  brother's fate, but he was bent on his objects, and carried some of them  out. He had the Sempronian law reaffirmed, though he could not act on  it; but in the meantime he began a regular custom of having corn served  out to the poorer citizens, and found work for them upon roads and  bridges; also he caused the state to clothe the soldiers, instead of  their doing it at their own expense. Another scheme which he first  proposed was to make the Italians of the countries now one with Roman  territory into citizens, with votes like the Romans themselves; but this  again angered the patricians, who saw they should be swamped by numbers  and lose their power.    He also wanted to found a colony of plebeians on the ruins of Carthage,  and when his tribuneship was over he went to Africa to see about it; but  when he came home the patricians had arranged an attack on him, and he  was insulted by the lictor of the consul Opimius. The patricians  collected on one side, the poorer sort around Caius on the Aventine  Hill; but the nobles were the strongest, the plebeians fled, and Caius  withdrew with one slave into a sacred grove, whence he hoped to reach  the Tiber; but the wood was surrounded, his retreat was cut off, and he  commanded the slave to kill him that he might not fall alive into the  hands of his enemies, after which the poor faithful fellow killed  himself, unable to bear the loss of his master. The weight of Caius'  head in gold had been promised by the Senate, and the man who found the  body was said to have taken out the brains and filled it up with lead  that his reward might be larger. Three thousand men were killed in this  riot, ten times as many as at Tiberius' death.    Opimius was so proud of having overthrown Caius, that he had a medal  struck with Hercules slaying the monsters. Cornelia, broken-hearted,  retired to a country-house; but in a few years the feeling turned,  great love was shown to the memory of the two brothers, statues were set  up in their honor, and when Cornelia herself died, her statue was  inscribed with the title she had coveted, \"The mother of the Gracchi.\"    [Illustration: ROMAN CENTURION.]    Things were indeed growing worse and worse. The Romans were as brave as  ever in the field, and were sure in the end to conquer any nation they  came in contact with; but at home, the city was full of overgrown rich  men, with huge hosts of slaves, and of turbulent poor men, who only  cared for their citizenship for the sake of the corn they gained by it,  and the games exhibited by those who stood for a magistracy. Immense  sums were spent in hiring gladiators and bringing wild animals to be  baited for their amusement; and afterwards, when sent out to govern the  provinces, the expenses were repaid by cruel grinding and robbing the  people of the conquered states.          CHAPTER XXIII.    THE WARS OF MARIUS.    106-98.      After the death of Massinissa, king of Numidia, the ally of the Romans,  there were disputes among his grandsons, and Jugurtha, whom they held to  have the least right, obtained the kingdom. The commander of the army  sent against him was Caius Marius, who had risen from being a free Roman  peasant in the village of Arpinum, but serving under Scipio AEmilianus,  had shown such ability, that when some one was wondering where they  would find the equal of Scipio when he was gone, that general touched  the shoulder of his young officer and said, \"Possibly here.\"    Rough soldier as he always was, he married Julia, of the high family of  the Caesars, who were said to be descended from AEneas; and though he was  much disliked by the Senate, he always carried the people with him. When  he received the province of Numidia, instead of, as every one had done  before, forming his army only of Roman citizens, he offered to enlist  whoever would, and thus filled his ranks with all sorts of wild and  desperate men, whom he could indeed train to fight, but who had none of  the old feeling for honor or the state, and this in the end made a great  change in Rome.    Jugurtha maintained a wild war in the deserts of Africa with Marius, but  at last he was betrayed to the Romans by his friend Bocchus, another  Moorish king, and Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Marius' lieutenant, was sent  to receive him--a transaction which Sulla commemorated on a signet ring  which he always wore. Poor Jugurtha was kept two years to appear at the  triumph, where he walked in chains, and then was thrown alive into the  dungeon under the Capitol, where he took six days to die of cold and  hunger.    Marius was elected consul for the second time even before he had quite  come home from Africa, for it was a time of great danger. Two fierce and  terrible tribes, whom the Romans called Cimbri and Teutones, and who  were but the vanguard of the swarms who would overwhelm them six  centuries later, had come down through Germany to the settled countries  belonging to Rome, especially the lands round the old Greek settlements  in Gaul, which had fallen of course into the hands of the Romans, and  were full of beautiful rich cities, with houses and gardens round them.  The Province, as the Romans called it, would have been grand plundering  ground for these savages, and Marius established himself in a camp on  the banks of the Rhone to protect it, cutting a canal to bring his  provisions from the sea, which still remains. While he was thus engaged,  he was a fourth time elected consul.    [Illustration: MARIUS.]    The enemy began to move. The Cimbri meant to march eastward round the  Alps, and pour through the Tyrol into Italy; the Teutones to go by the  West, fighting Marius on the way. But he would not come out of his camp  on the Rhone, though the Teutones, as they passed, shouted to ask the  Roman soldiers what messages they had to send to their wives in"]]]
