I was told that the premises he  now occupies were once an old church or monastery, and that a thousand  fluttering sheets are now suspended, where formerly was seen the solemn  procession of silken banners, with religious emblems, emblazoned in colours  of all hues. I called at the old shop, and supplied myself with a dingy  copy of the _Catalogue de la Bibliotheque Bleue_--from which catalogue  however I could purchase but little; as the greater part of the old books,  several of the _Caxtonian stamp_, had taken their departures. It was from  this Catalogue that I learnt the precise character of the works destined  for common reading; and from hence inferred, what I stated to you a little  time ago, that _Romances, Rondelays_, and chivalrous stories, are yet read  with pleasure by the good people of France. It is, in short, from this  lower, or _lowest_ species of literature--if it must be so designated--that  we gather the real genius, or mental character of the ordinary classes of  society. I do assure you that some of these _chap_ publications are  singularly droll and curious. Even the very rudiments of learning, or the  mere alphabet-book, meets the eye in a very imposing manner--as in the  following facsimile.    [Illustration]    _Love, Marriage_, and _Confession_, are fertile themes in these little  farthing chap books. Yonder sits a fille de chambre, after her work is  done. She is intent upon some little manual, taken from the _Bibliotheque  Bleue_. Approach her, and ask her for a sight of it. She smiles, and  readily shews you _Catechisme a l'usage des Grandes Filles pour etre  Mariees; ensemble la maniere d'attirer les Amans_. At the first glance of  it, you suppose that this is entirely, from beginning to end, a wild and  probably somewhat indecorous manual of instruction. By no means; for read  the _Litanies_ and _Prayer_ with which it concludes, and which I here send;  admitting that they exhibit a strange mixture of the simple and the  serious.        LITANIES.        _Pour toutes les Filles qui desirent entrer en menage_.        _Kyrie,_ je voudrois,      _Christe_, etre mariee.      _Kyrie_, je prie tous les Saints,      _Christe_, que ce soin demain.      _Sainte Marie_, tout le Monde se marie.      _Saint Joseph_, que vous ai-je fait?      _Saint Nicolas_, ne m'oubliez pas.      _Saint Mederie_, que j'aie un bon mari.      _Saint Matthieu_, qu'il craigne Dieu.      _Saint Jean_, qu'il m'aime tendrement.      _Saint Bruno_, qu'il soit juli & beau.      _Saint Francois_, qu'il me soit fidele.      _Saint Andre_, qu'il soit a mon gre.      _Saint Didier_, qu'il aime a travailler.      _Saint Honore_, qu'il n'aime pas a jouer.      _Saint Severin_, qu'il n'aime pas le vin.      _Saint Clement_, qu'il soit diligent.      _Saint Sauveur_, qu'il ait bon coeur.      _Saint Nicaise_, que je sois a mon aise.      _Saint Josse_, qu'il me donne un carrosse.      _Saint Boniface_, que mon mariage se fasse,      _Saint Augustin_, des demain matin.        ORAISON.        Seigneur, qui avez forme Adam de la terre, et qui lui avez      donne Eve pour sa compagne; envoyez-moi, s'il vous plait, un      bon mari pour compagnon, non pour la volupte, mais pour vous      honorer & avoir des enfants qui vous benissent. Ainsi soit il.    Among the books of this class, before alluded to, I purchased a singularly  amusing little manual called \"_La Confession de la Bonne Femme_.\" It is  really not divested of merit. Whether however it may not have been written  during the Revolution, with a view to ridicule the practice of auricular  confession which yet obtains throughout France, I cannot take upon me to  pronounce; but there are undoubtedly some portions of it which seem so  obviously to satirise this practice, that one can hardly help drawing a  conclusion in the affirmative. On the other hand it may perhaps be  inferred, with greater probability, that it is intended to shew with what  extreme facility a system of _self-deception_ may be maintained.[75]  Referring however to the little manual in question, among the various  choice morceaus which it contains, take the following extracts:  exemplificatory of a woman's _evading the main points of confession_.        _Confesseur_. Ne voulez vous pas me repondre; en un mot, combien      y a-t-il de temps que vous ne vous etes confessee?        _La Penitente._ Il y a un mois tout juste, car c'etoit le      quatrieme jour du mois passe, & nous sommes au cinquieme du mois      courant; or comptez, mon pere, & vous trouverez justement que ...        C. C'est assez, ne parlez point tant, & dites moi en peu de mots vos      peches.        _Elle raconte les peches d'autrui._        _La Penitente_. J'ai un enfant qui est le plus mechant garcon que      vous ayez jamais vu: il jure, bat sa soeur, il fuit l'ecole, derobe      tout ce qu'il peut pour jouer; il suit de mechans fripons: l'autre      jour en courant il perdit son chapeau. Enfin, c'est un mechant garcon,      je veux vous l'amener afin que vous me l'endoctriniez un peu s'il vous      plait.        C. Dites-moi vos peches.        P. Mais, mon pere, j'ai une fille qui est encore pire. Je ne la peux      faire lever le matin: Je l'appelle cent fois: _Marguerite: plait-il ma      Mere? leve-toi promptement et descends: j'y vais_. Elle ne bouge pas.      _Si tu ne viens maintenant, tu seras battue._ Elle s'en moque. Quand      je l'envoie a la Ville, je lui dis _reviens promptement, ne t'amuse      pas_. Cependant, elle s'arrete a toutes les portes comme l'ane d'un      meunier, elle babille avec tous ceux qu'elle rencontre; & quand elle      me fait cela, je la bats: ne fais-je pas bien, mon pere?        C. Dites-moi _vos_ peches et non pas ceux de _vos enfans_.        P. Il se trouve, mon pere, que nous avons dans notre rue une voisine      qui est la plus mechante de toutes les femmes: elle jure, elle      querelle tous ceux qui passent, personne ne la peut souffrir, ni son      mari, ni ses enfans, & bien souvent elle s'enivre, & vous me dites,      mon pere, quelle est celle-la? c'est ...        C. Ah gardez-vous bien de la nommer; car a la confession il ne faut      jamais fair connoitre les personnes dont vous declarez les peches.        P. C'est elle qui vient se confesser apres moi: grondez-la bien, car      vous ne lui en sauriez trop dire.        C. Taisez-vous donc, & ne parlez que de _vos_ peches, non pas de ceux      _des autres_.        _Elle s'accuse de ce qui n'est point peche._        _Penitente_.--Ah! mon pere, j'ai fait un grand peche, ah! le      grand peche! Helas je serai damnee, quoique mon confesseur m'ait      defendu de le dire j'amais, neanmoins mon pere je vais vous le      declarer.        C. Ne le dites point, puisque votre confesseur vous l'a defendu, je ne      veux point l'entendre.        P. Ah! n'importe; je veux vous le dire, c'est un trop grand peche:      J'ai battu ma mere.        C. Vous avez battu votre mere! Ah! miserable, c'est un cas reserve &      un crime qui merite la potence. Et quand l'avez-vous battue?        P. Quand j'etois petite de l'age de quatre ans.        C. Ah! simple, ne savez-vous pas que tout ce que les enfans font avant      l'age de raison, qui est environ l'age de sept ans, ne sauroit etre un      peche.    There is however one thing, which I must frankly declare to you as entitled  to distinct notice and especial commendation. It is, the method of teaching  \"catechisms\" of a different and higher order: I mean the CHURCH CATECHISMS.  Both the Cathedral and the Abbey of St. Ouen have numerous side chapels.  Within these side chapels are collected, on stated days of the week, the  young of both sexes. They are arranged in a circle. A priest, in his white  robes, is seated, or stands, in the centre of them. He examines, questions,  corrects, or commends, as the opportunity calls for it. His manner is  winning and persuasive. His action is admirable. The lads shew him great  respect, and are rarely rude, or seen to laugh. Those who answer well, and  pay the greater attention, receive, with words of commendation, gentle pats  upon the head--and I could not but consider the blush, with which this mark  of favour was usually received, as so many presages of future excellence in  the youth. I once witnessed a most determined catechetical lecture of  girls; who might be called, in the language of their matrimonial catechism,  \"de grandes filles.\" It was on an evening, in the Chapel of Our Lady in St.  Ouen's Abbey, that this examination took place. Two elderly priests  attended. The responses of the females were as quick as they were correct;  the eye being always invariably fixed on the pavement, accompanied with a  gravity and even piety of expression. A large group of mothers, with  numerous spectators, were in attendance. A question was put, to which a  supposed incorrect response was given. It was repeated, and the same answer  followed. The priest hesitated: something like vexation was kindling in his  cheek, while the utmost calmness and confidence seemed to mark the  countenance of the examinant. The attendant mothers were struck with  surprise. A silence for one minute ensued. The question related to the  \"Holy Spirit.\" The priest gently approached the girl, and softly  articulated--\"Mais, ma chere considerez un peu,\"--and repeated the  question. \"Mon pere, (yet more softly, rejoined the pupil) j'ai bien  consideree, et je crois que c'est comme je vous l'ai deja dit.\" The Priest  crossed his hands upon his breast ... brought down his eyebrows in a  thoughtful mood ... and turning quickly round to the girl, addressed her in  the most affectionate tone of voice--\"Ma petite,--tu as bien dit; et  j'avois tort.\" The conduct of the girl was admirable: She curtsied,  blushed... and with eyes, from which tears seemed ready to start, surveyed  the circle of spectators ... caught the approving glance of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],[0,"Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#18)"],[1,"neighbor.    \"The poor little creature!  How could they abuse it and take its life?\"  cried Alice, turning to those nearest her.  The other girls shrank back  abashed at her reproachful tones, which were noticed by Jim Stubbs, and  that hero felt called upon to make a speech.    \"Bah! boys, that girl is getting ready to cry over a dead squirrel.  What d'ye think of that?\"  And a heartless chorus echoed his laughter.    \"No, I'm too indignant to cry,\" replied Alice with spirit.  \"I never  knew boys could be so awfully wicked, yes, and girls too.  I should  think you would love these dear little creatures, and pet and protect  them.  They are what make country life pleasant.  I wouldn't give a fig  for your pretty woods if there were no living things to be seen there.\"    This was an aspect of the situation the boys had never before  considered.  They did not realize that to a lover of nature the  humblest form of animal life is interesting.  Did other people really  prize squirrels and frogs and lightning bugs and such things?    Just at this moment the teacher entered, and the crestfallen pupils  busied themselves in gathering up the scattered books and other  articles used in storming the squirrel.    \"My young visitor is quite shocked by such an exhibition of cruelty,\"  said Miss Harper, when she had learned how matters stood.  \"Think what  the woods would be without the song of birds and the chirp and hum of  insects.  Your playground teems with happy beings that love the warmth  and sunlight as well as you do.  Would not the forests be robbed of  half their beauty and interest if the squirrels and chipmunks and birds  and butterflies were killed off?\"    \"Wimmen folks are nice ones to talk about cruelty to birds,\" sneered  the big boy to his neighbor, \"when they stick wings and tails and whole  birds on their hats and bonnets whenever they can raise a cent to buy  'em with.  Oh, yes, wimmen are awful consistent!  They are, for a fact.\"    Had his words reached Miss Harper's ears she might have replied that  sensible and humane \"wimmen folks\" regarded the fearful slaughter of  birds as little less than a crime; but unfortunately she did not hear  this and resumed:    \"Yet you hunt out these harmless and beautiful creatures and wantonly  destroy them.  Nearly every boy gives way to this savage, brutal  impulse to kill something.  He couldn't tell why if you were to ask  him.  Children, do you know there is a society whose members pledge  themselves to protect the birds?  I wish we might organize one here  to-day.  I am sure, from a spirit of kindness, you would like to unite  in a promise not to willfully harm any of these wonderful creatures  that God has placed around us.\"    When Alice Glenn drove home that evening she carried with her a glad  heart, for in her pocket was a copy of the rules and by-laws of the  \"Anti-Cruelty Society, of Mount Airy School,\" which Miss Harper had  organized that afternoon.  And it was signed not only by the girls and  all the smaller boys, but by big Jim Stubbs and the boy who winked with  his nose.          CHAPTER XV    POLLY'S FAREWELL      Happy little maiden,    Give, oh, give to me    The highness of your courage,    The sweetness of your grace,    To speak a large word in a little place.            --_E. S. Phelps-Ward._      Closing the volume, Polly laid it in her lap.    \"That was a good story,\" observed Miss Kathy, as the child paused.  The  little girl did not immediately reply, but leaned forward and looked  wistfully in her companion's face for a moment.    \"Do you think it is so very wicked to keep--that is, to--to deprive a  bird of its liberty?\" she asked timidly.    \"Oh, I don't know that it could be called wicked.  A canary bird, born  in a cage, that never knew any other home, would be apt to die if it  were turned loose to shift for itself and get its own living.  It  possibly could not stand the exposure to the weather,\" replied Miss  Katharine.    \"But supposing it wasn't a canary,\" said Polly hesitatingly; \"supposing  it might be a redbird, or a wren, or--or----\"    \"Or a bobolink?\" Miss Kathy smiled as she supplied the word.    \"Well--yes, a bobolink, for instance.\"  And Polly glanced toward me.    \"Any captured bird certainly feels very bad to be shut up in a cage all  its life, though I have seen robins in captivity that grew to be as  tame as canaries.  My aunt had one that lived twelve years in a cage.  It would peck her cheek, and pretend to kiss her, and do all sorts of  sweet little tricks.  His cage door stood open, and he went in and out  as it suited him, but he never thought of flying away.  However, it is  only natural to suppose that hopping about in a narrow space would be  dreadful to a bird accustomed to spreading its wings and soaring up  through the sky whenever and wherever it pleased.\"    Miss Kathy looked at the clock.  She saw it was time for her to go back  into the store, then gathered up her work and went into the front room.  When Polly was left to herself I could see she was thinking very hard.  The rocking-chair kept moving faster, and her forehead was drawn into a  little pucker between her eyes.  She sighed too, occasionally, as if  she were sad.    I noticed that Miss Katharine from her post behind the counter looked  in at the child from time to time, and I heard her say half-aloud: \"If  the fashionable women of the land had hearts as merciful and  consciences as tender as that dear little Polly's, the slaughter of the  birds would soon come to an end.\"    The birch chair finally ceased to rock.  The deep-drawn wrinkle passed  away from Polly's forehead.  She laid down her book and came to my  cage, then she stood for a moment looking at me tenderly.  Then she  took the cage down from its hook and carried it to the door leading to  the garden.  The air was pleasant, and a sunbeam slanted across the  porch making a yellow gleam on the lattice.  How beautiful it looked to  my weary eyes!    \"Dearest Dickey Downy, good-bye,\" she said to me, and her voice had a  little tremor in it.  \"You had a right to be happy and live out of  doors among the trees, and I kept you a prisoner.  Please forgive me  for it, and forgive me for wearing birds' wings on my Sunday hat.  I  shall never do such cruel things again.  It's coming spring now,  Dickey, so be happy and fly away to the beautiful clouds.\"    She set the little wire door wide open.  A warm zephyr swept by, laden  with the scent of wild flowers and all sweet growing things.  My heart  fluttered with joy.  I heard the far cry of the hills as I floated out  and upward, higher and higher, on joyous wing.  I was free, free!"]]]
