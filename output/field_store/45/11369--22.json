Various tribes were said to reside in  this valley, and along the banks of the Wallamot.    About eight miles above the mouth of the Wallamot the little squadron  arrived at Vancouver's Point, so called in honor of that celebrated  voyager by his lieutenant (Broughton) when he explored the river.  This point is said to present one of the most beautiful scenes on the  Columbia; a lovely meadow, with a silver sheet of limpid water in the  center, enlivened by wild-fowl, a range of hills crowned by forests,  while the prospect is closed by Mount Hood, a magnificent mountain  rising into a lofty peak, and covered with snow; the ultimate landmark  of the first explorers of the river.    Point Vancouver is about one hundred miles from Astoria. Here the reflux  of the tide ceases to be perceptible. To this place vessels of two and  three hundred tons burden may ascend. The party under the command of  Mr. Stuart had been three or four days in reaching it, though we have  forborne to notice their daily progress and nightly encampments.    From Point Vancouver the river turned towards the northeast, and  became more contracted and rapid, with occasional islands and frequent  sand-banks. These islands are furnished with a number of ponds, and  at certain seasons abound with swans, geese, brandts, cranes, gulls,  plover, and other wild-fowl. The shores, too, are low and closely  wooded, with such an undergrowth of vines and rushes as to be almost  impassable.    About thirty miles above Point Vancouver the mountains again approach  on both sides of the river, which is bordered by stupendous precipices,  covered with the fir and the white cedar, and enlivened occasionally by  beautiful cascades leaping from a great height, and sending up wreaths  of vapor. One of these precipices, or cliffs, is curiously worn by time  and weather so as to have the appearance of a ruined fortress, with  towers and battlements, beetling high above the river, while two small  cascades, one hundred and fifty feet in height, pitch down from the  fissures of the rocks.    The turbulence and rapidity of the current continually augmenting as  they advanced, gave the voyagers intimation that they were approaching  the great obstructions of the river, and at length they arrived at  Strawberry Island, so called by Lewis and Clarke, which lies at the  foot of the first rapid. As this part of the Columbia will be repeatedly  mentioned in the course of this work, being the scene of some of its  incidents, we shall give a general description of it in this place.    The falls or rapids of the Columbia are situated about one hundred and  eighty miles above the mouth of the river. The first is a perpendicular  cascade of twenty feet, after which there is a swift descent for a  mile, between islands of hard black rock, to another pitch of eight feet  divided by two rocks. About two and a half miles below this the river  expands into a wide basin, seemingly dammed up by a perpendicular ridge  of black rock. A current, however, sets diagonally to the left of this  rocky barrier, where there is a chasm forty-five yards in width. Through  this the whole body of the river roars along, swelling and whirling  and boiling for some distance in the wildest confusion. Through this  tremendous channel the intrepid explorers of the river, Lewis and  Clarke, passed in their boats; the danger being, not from the rocks, but  from the great surges and whirlpools.    At the distance of a mile and a half from the foot of this narrow  channel is a rapid, formed by two rocky islands; and two miles beyond is  a second great fall, over a ledge of rocks twenty feet high, extending  nearly from shore to shore. The river is again compressed into a channel  from fifty to a hundred feet wide, worn through a rough bed of hard  black rock, along which it boils and roars with great fury for the  distance of three miles. This is called \"The Long Narrows.\"    Here is the great fishing place of the Columbia. In the spring of the  year, when the water is high, the salmon ascend the river in incredible  numbers. As they pass through this narrow strait, the Indians, standing  on the rocks, or on the end of wooden stages projecting from the banks,  scoop them up with small nets distended on hoops and attached to long  handles, and cast them on the shore.    They are then cured and packed in a peculiar manner. After having  been opened and disemboweled, they are exposed to the sun on scaffolds  erected on the river banks. When sufficiently dry, they are pounded fine  between two stones, pressed into the smallest compass, and packed  in baskets or bales of grass matting, about two feet long and one in  diameter, lined with the cured skin of a salmon. The top is likewise  covered with fish skins, secured by cords passing through holes in the  edge of the basket. Packages are then made, each containing twelve of  these bales, seven at bottom, five at top, pressed close to each other,  with the corded side upward, wrapped in mats and corded. These are  placed in dry situations, and again covered with matting. Each of these  packages contains from ninety to a hundred pounds of dried fish, which  in this state will keep sound for several years.**         **(Lewis and Clarke, vol. ii. p. 32.)    We have given this process at some length, as furnished by the first  explorers, because it marks a practiced ingenuity in preparing articles  of traffic for a market, seldom seen among our aboriginals. For like  reason we would make especial mention of the village of Wishram, at the  head of the Long Narrows, as being a solitary instance of an aboriginal  trading mart, or emporium. Here the salmon caught in the neighboring  rapids were \"warehoused,\" to await customers. Hither the tribes from  the mouth of the Columbia repaired with the fish of the sea-coast, the  roots, berries, and especially the wappatoo, gathered in the lower parts  of the river, together with goods and trinkets obtained from the ships  which casually visit the coast. Hither also the tribes from the  Rocky Mountains brought down horses, bear-grass, quamash, and other  commodities of the interior. The merchant fishermen at the falls acted  as middlemen or factors, and passed the objects of traffic, as it were,  cross-handed; trading away part of the wares received from the mountain  tribes to those of the rivers and plains, and vice versa: their packages  of pounded salmon entered largely into the system of barter, and being  carried off in opposite directions, found their way to the savage  hunting camps far in the interior, and to the casual white traders who  touched upon the coast.    We have already noticed certain contrarieties of character between the  Indian tribes, produced by their diet and mode of life; and nowhere are  they more apparent than about the falls of the Columbia. The Indians  of this great fishing mart are represented by the earliest explorers as  sleeker and fatter, but less hardy and active, than the tribes of the  mountains and prairies, who live by hunting, or of the upper parts of  the river, where fish is scanty, and the inhabitants must eke out their  subsistence by digging roots or chasing the deer. Indeed, whenever an  Indian of the upper country is too lazy to hunt, yet is fond of good  living, he repairs to the falls, to live in abundance without labor.    \"By such worthless dogs as these,\" says an honest trader in his journal,  which now lies before us, \"by such worthless dogs as these are these  noted fishing-places peopled, which, like our great cities, may with  propriety be called the headquarters of vitiated principles.\"    The habits of trade and the avidity of gain have their corrupting  effects even in the wilderness, as may be instanced in the members of  this aboriginal emporium; for the same journalist denounces them as  \"saucy, impudent rascals, who will steal when they can, and pillage  whenever a weak party falls in their power.\"    That he does not belie them will be evidenced hereafter, when we have  occasion again to touch at Wishram and navigate the rapids. In the  present instance the travellers effected the laborious ascent of this  part of the river, with all its various portages, without molestation,  and once more launched away in smooth water above the high falls.    The two parties continued together, without material impediment, for  three or four hundred miles further up the Columbia; Mr. Thompson  appearing to take great interest in the success of Mr. Stuart, and  pointing out places favorable, as he said, to the establishment of his  contemplated trading post.    Mr. Stuart, who distrusted his sincerity, at length pretended to adopt  his advice, and, taking leave of him, remained as if to establish  himself, while the other proceeded on his course towards the mountains.  No sooner, however, had he fairly departed than Mr. Stuart again pushed  forward, under guidance of the two Indians, nor did he stop until he had  arrived within about one hundred and forty miles of the Spokan River,  which he considered near enough to keep the rival establishment in  check. The place which he pitched upon for his trading post was a point  of land about three miles in length and two in breadth, formed by the  junction of the Oakinagan with the Columbia. The former is a river which  has its source in a considerable lake about one hundred and fifty miles  west of the point of junction. The two rivers, about the place of their  confluence, are bordered by immense prairies covered with herbage, but  destitute of trees. The point itself was ornamented with wild flowers  of every hue, in which innumerable humming-birds were \"banqueting nearly  the livelong day.\"    The situation of this point appeared to be well adapted for a trading  post.

A BALLAD OF CALIFORNIA.    BY BAYARD TAYLOR.      From the doorway, Manuela, in the sheeny April morn,    Southward looks, along the valley, over leagues of gleaming corn;    Where the mountain's misty rampart like the wall of Eden towers,    And the isles of oak are sleeping on a painted sea of flowers.    All the air is full of music, for the winter rains are o'er,    And the noisy magpies chatter from the budding sycamore;    Blithely frisk unnumbered squirrels, over all the grassy slope;    Where the airy summits brighten, nimbly leaps the antelope.    Gentle eyes of Manuela! tell me wherefore do ye rest    On the oaks' enchanted islands and the flowery ocean's breast?    Tell me wherefore down the valley, ye have traced the highway's mark    Far beyond the belts of timber, to the mountain-shadows dark?    Ah, the fragrant bay may blossom, and the sprouting verdure shine    With the tears of amber dropping from the tassels of the pine.    And the morning's breath of balsam lightly brush her sunny cheek--    Little recketh Manuela of the tales of Spring they speak.    When the Summer's burning solstice on the mountain-harvests glowed,    She had watched a gallant horseman riding down the valley road;    Many times she saw him turning, looking back with parting thrills,    Till amid her tears she lost him, in the shadow of the hills.    Ere the cloudless moons were over, he had passed the Desert's sand.    Crossed the rushing Colorada and the dark Apache Land,    And his laden mules were driven, when the time of rains began.    With the traders of Chihuaha, to the Fair of San Juan.    Therefore watches Manuela--therefore lightly doth she start,    When the sound of distant footsteps seems the beating of her heart;    Not a wind the green oak rustles or the redwood branches stirs,    But she hears the silver jingle of his ringing bit and spurs.    Often, out the hazy distance, come the horsemen, day by day,    But they come not as Bernardo--she can see it, far away;    Well she knows the airy gallop of his mettled _alazan_,[5]    Light as any antelope upon the Hills of Gavilan.    She would know him mid a thousand, by his free and gallant air;    By the featly-knit sarape,[6] such as wealthy traders wear;    By his broidered calzoneros[7] and his saddle, gaily spread,    With its cantle rimmed with silver, and its horn a lion's head.    None like he the light riata[8] on the maddened bull can throw;    None amid the mountain-canons, track like he the stealthy doe;    And at all the Mission festals, few indeed the revelers are    Who can dance with him the jota, touch with him the gay guitar.    He has said to Manuela, and the echoes linger still    In the cloisters of her bosom, with a secret, tender thrill,    When the hay again has blossomed, and the valley stands in corn,    Shall the bells of Santa Clara usher in the wedding morn.    He has pictured the procession, all in holyday attire,    And the laugh and look of gladness, when they see the distant spire;    Then their love shall kindle newly, and the world be doubly fair,    In the cool delicious crystal of the summer morning air.    Tender eyes of Manuela! what has dimmed your lustrous beam?    'Tis a tear that falls to glitter on the casket of her dream.    Ah, the eye of love must brighten, if its watches would be true,    For the star is falsely mirrored in the rose's drop of dew!    But her eager eyes rekindle, and her breathless bosom stills,    As she sees a horseman moving in the shadow of the hills;    Now in love and fond thanksgiving they may loose their pearly tides--    'Tis the alazan that gallops, 'tis Bernardo's self that rides!    [Footnote 5: In California horses are named according to their color.  An _alazan_ is a sorrel--a color generally preferred, as denoting  speed and mettle.]    [Footnote 6: The sarape is a knit blanket of many gay colors, worn  over the shoulders by an opening in the center, through which the head  is thrust.]    [Footnote 7: Calzoneros are trowsers, generally made of blue cloth  or velvet, richly embroidered, and worn over an under pair of white  linen. They are slashed up the outside of each leg, for greater  convenience in riding, and studded with rows of silver buttons.]    [Footnote 8: The lariat, or riata, as it is indifferently called in  California and Mexico, is precisely the same as the lasso of South  America.]           *       *       *       *       *    FROM FRASER'S MAGAZINE FOR JULY.    LEDRU ROLLIN.    Ledru Rollin is now in his forty-fourth or forty-fifth year,  having been born in 1806 or 1807. He is the grandson of the famous  _Prestidigateur_, or Conjurer Comus, who, about four or five-and-forty  years ago, was in the acme of his fame. During the Consulate, and a  considerable portion of the Empire, Comus traveled from one department  of France to the other, and is even known to have extended his  journeys beyond the Rhine and the Moselle on one side, and beyond the  Rhone and Garonne on the other. Of all the conjurers of his day he was  the most famous and the most successful, always, of course, excepting  that Corsican conjurer who ruled for so many years the destinies  of France. From those who have seen that famous trickster, we  have learned that the Charleses, the Alexanders, even the Robert  Houdins, were children compared with the magical wonder-worker of  the past generation. The fame of Comus was enormous, and his gains  proportionate; and when he had shuffled off this mortal coil it  was found he had left to his descendants a very ample--indeed, for  France, a very large fortune. Of the descendants in a right line, his  grandson, Ledru Rollin, was his favorite, and to him the old man left  the bulk of his fortune, which, during the minority of Ledru Rollin,  grew to a sum amounting to nearly, if not fully, L4,000 per annum.    The scholastic education of the young man who was to inherit this  considerable fortune, was nearly completed during the reign of  Louis XVIII., and shortly after Charles X. ascended the throne _il  commencait a faire sur droit_, as they phrase it in the _pays Latin_.  Neither during the reign of Louis XVIII., nor indeed now, unless in  the exact and physical sciences, does Paris afford a very solid and  substantial education. Though the Roman poets and historians are  tolerably well studied and taught, yet little attention is paid to  Greek literature. The physical and exact sciences are unquestionably  admirably taught at the Polytechnique and other schools; but neither  at the College of St. Barbe, nor of Henry IV., can a pupil be so well  grounded in the rudiments and humanities as in our grammar and public  schools. A studious, pains-taking, and docile youth, will, no doubt,  learn a great deal, no matter where he has been placed in pupilage;  but we have heard from a contemporary of M. Rollin, that he was not  particularly distinguished either for his industry or his docility in  early life. The earliest days of the reign of Charles X. saw M. Ledru  Rollin an _etudiant en droit_ in Paris. Though the schools of law  had been re-established during the Consulate pretty much after the  fashion in which they existed in the time of Louis the XIV., yet the  application of the _alumni_ was fitful and desultory, and perhaps  there were no two classes in France, at the commencement of 1825. who  were more imbued with the Voltarian philosophy and the doctrines and  principles of Rousseau, than the _eleves_ of the schools of law and  medicine.    Under a king so sceptical and voluptuous, so much of a _philosophie_  and _phyrroneste_, as Louis XVIII., such tendencies were likely to  spread themselves through all ranks of society--to permeate from  the very highest to the very lowest classes: and not all the lately  acquired asceticism of the monarch, his successor, nor all the  efforts of the Jesuits could restrain or control the tendencies of  the _etudiants en droit_. What the law-students were antecedently and  subsequent to 1825, we know from the _Physiologie de l'Homme de Loi_;  and it is not to be supposed that M. Ledru Rollin, with more ample  pecuniary means at command, very much differed from his fellows.  After undergoing a three years' course of study, M. Rollin obtained  a diploma as a _licencie en droit_, and commenced his career as  _stagiare_ somewhere about the end of 1826 or the beginning of 1827.  Toward the close of 1829, or in the first months of 1830, he was, we  believe, placed on the roll of advocates; so that he was called to  the bar, or, as they say in France, received an advocate, in his  twenty-second or twenty-third year.    The first years of an advocate, even in France, are generally passed  in as enforced an idleness as in England. Clients come not to consult  the greenhorn of the last term; nor does any _avoue_ among our  neighbors, any more than any attorney among ourselves, fancy that an  old head is to be found on young shoulders. The years 1830 and 1831  were not marked by any oratorical effort of the author of the _Decline  of England_; nor was it till 1832 that, being then one of the youngest  of the bar of Paris, he prepared and signed an opinion against the  placing of Paris in a state of siege consequent on the insurrections  of June. Two years after he prepared a memoir; or _factum_, on  the affair of the Rue Transonain, and defended Dupoty, accused  of _complicite morale_, a monstrous doctrine invented by the  Attorney-General Hebert. From 1834 to 1841 he appeared as counsel in  nearly all the cases of _emeute_ or conspiracy where the individuals  prosecuted were Republicans, or _quasi_-Republicans. Meanwhile, he  had become the proprietor and _redacteur en chef_ of the _Reforme_  newspaper, a political journal of an ultra-Liberal--indeed of a"]]]
