They must  take the road immediately and be kept moving day and night  until they die of starvation, or until the owner (who is debarred,  by Section 1, from purchasing a pasturage for his cattle) disposes of them  to a white man.    Such cruelty to dumb animals is as unwarranted as it is unprecedented.  It reads cruel enough on paper, but we wish that the reader had accompanied us  on one journey, say, during the cold snap in the first week in August,  when we travelled from Potchefstroom to Vereeniging,  and seen the flocks of those evicted Natives that we met.  We frequently met those roving pariahs, with their hungry cattle,  and wondered if the animals were not more deserving of pity than their owners.  It may be the cattle's misfortune that they have a black owner,  but it is certainly not their fault, for sheep have no choice  in the selection of a colour for their owners, and no cows or goats  are ever asked to decide if the black boy who milks them shall be their owner,  or but a herd in the employ of a white man; so why should they be starved  on account of the colour of their owners?  We knew of a law to prevent cruelty  to animals, but had never thought that we should live to meet in one day  so many dumb creatures making silent appeals to Heaven for protection  against the law.  \"What man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to see\",  and oh! if those gifted Parliamentarians could have been mustered here  to witness the wretched results of one of their fine days' work  for a fine day's pay!  But \"they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne\",  then draw their Parliamentary emoluments and retire to the quiet  of their comfortable homes, to enjoy more rest than is due to toilers  who have served both God and humanity.    During this same night in Hoopstad district we were also told of the visit  of a Dutch farmer in the middle of June, 1913, to his native tenants.  One of the Natives -- named Kgabale -- was rather old.  His two sons are  delving in the gold mines of Johannesburg, and return home each spring time  to help the old man and their two young sisters to do the ploughing.  The daughters tend the fields and Kgabale looks after the stock.  By this means they have been enabled to lead a respectable life  and to pay the landowner fifty per cent. of the produce every year,  besides the taxes levied by the Government on Natives.  Three weeks before our visit, the farmer came to cancel  Kgabale's verbal contract with him and to turn the family  into unpaid servants, in return for the privilege of squatting on his farm.  As Kgabale himself was too old to work, the farmer demanded of him  that his two sons should return immediately from Johannesburg  to render manual service on his farm, failing which, the old man  should forthwith betake himself from the place.  He gave Kgabale seven days  to deliver his two sons.    Naturally this decision came upon Kgabale and his daughters  like a bolt from the blue.  The poor old man wandered from place to place,  trying to find some one -- and it took him two days to do so --  who could write, so as to dictate a letter to his sons in Johannesburg,  informing them of what had happened.  The week expired before he could get  a reply from Johannesburg.  The landlord, in a very abusive mood,  again demanded the instant arrival of his two sons from Johannesburg,  to commence work at the farm-house the very next morning.  Kgabale spent the whole night praying that at least one of his sons  might come.  By daybreak next morning no answer had arrived,  and the Dutchman came and set fire to the old man's houses,  and ordered him then and there to quit the farm.  It was a sad sight  to see the feeble old man, his aged wife and his daughters  driven in this way from a place which they had regarded as their home.  In the ordinary course, such a calamity could have been made more tolerable  by moving to the next farm and there await the arrival and advice of his sons;  but now, under the Natives' Land Act, no sympathetic landowner  would be permitted to shelter them for a single day.  So Kgabale was said  to have gone in the direction of Klerksdorp.    One of the sons arrived a week after the catastrophe.  He found  his old home in ruins, and that his aged parents and their children  had become victims of the turpitude of an Act of Parliament.  The son went in search of his relatives across the Vaal,  but it was not known if they succeeded in finding the refuge  which the law had made unlawful.    Among the squatters on the same farm as Kgabale was a widow named Maria.  Her husband in his lifetime had lived as a tenant on the farm,  ploughing in shares until his death.  After his death  Maria kept on the contract and made a fair living.  Her son and daughter,  aged fourteen and sixteen respectively, took turns at herding her cattle  and assisting the mother in other ways.  During the ploughing season,  they hired assistance to till the fields, but they themselves  tended and reaped the harvest and delivered 50 per cent of the produce  to the landowner.  Such were the conditions on which she was allowed  to live on the farm.  Maria, being a widow, and her son being but a youth,  it was hoped that the landlord would propose reasonable terms for her;  but instead, his proposal was that she should dispose of her stock  and indenture her children to him.  This sinister proposal makes it evident  that farmers not only expect Natives to render them free labour,  but they actually wish the Natives to breed slaves for them.  Maria found it difficult to comply with her landlord's demand,  and as she had no husband, from whom labour could be exacted,  the Dutchman ordered her to \"clear out, and,\" he added with an oath,  \"you must get another man before you reach your next place of abode,  as the law will not permit you to stay there till you have a man  to work for the Baas.\"  Having given this counsel the landlord is said  to have set fire to Maria's thatched cottage, and as the chilly south-easter  blew the smoke of her burning home towards the north-west, Maria,  with her bedclothes on her head, and on the heads of her son and daughter,  and carrying her three-year-old boy tied to her back,  walked off from the farm, driving her cows before her.  In parting from the endeared associations of their late home,  for one blank and unknown, the children were weeping bitterly.  Nor has any news of the fate of this family been received  since they were forced out on this perilous adventure.          Chapter VI      Our Indebtedness to White Women      O woman! in our hours of ease    Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,     And variable as the shade    By the light quivering aspen made;    When pain and anguish wring the brow,     A ministering angel thou.                                         Scott.        Some farmers (unfortunately too few) who had at first intended  to change the status of their native tenants, had been obliged  to abandon the idea owing to the determined opposition of their wives.  One such case was particularly interesting.  Thus, at Dashfontein,  the wife of a Dutch farmer, a Mr. V., on whose property some native families  were squatting, got up, one morning, and found the kitchen-maid  very disagreeable.  The morning coffee had been made right enough,  but the maid's \"Morre, Nooi\" (Good morning, ma'am) was rather sullen  and almost bordering on insolence.  She did her scullery work as usual,  but did not seem to care, that morning, about wasting time inquiring  how baby slept, and if Nonnie had got rid of her neuralgia, and so on.  She spoke only when spoken to and answered mainly in monosyllables.  Mrs. V. was perplexed.    \"What is the matter, Anna?\" she asked.    \"Nothing, Nooi,\" replied Anna curtly.    Mrs. V. tried some of her witty jokes, but they seemed to be wasted on Anna.  After jesting with the servant had failed, scolding was next tried,  but nothing seemed to bring back the girl's usual cheerfulness.  \"Oh, Anna,\" said the mistress at length, \"you make me think of the olden days,  when such disagreeable whims on the part of frowning maids  used to be cured by ----\"    Anna was evidently not listening, and, if she had heard the mistress,  she did not care two straws (or one straw for that matter) what cures  Mrs. V.'s great-grandmother had prescribed for sullen servant girls.  In fact, Anna had become a wild Kafir, for though she went about her work  in silence, her face bore an expression which seemed to speak louder  than her mouth could have done.  She was clearly engaged  in serious thought.  The mistress tried to dismiss from her mind  the inexplicable attitude of her servant, but the frowning look on Anna's face  made the attempts unsuccessful.  The fact that when Anna went home,  the previous night, she was happiness personified, did not decrease  Mrs. V.'s perplexity.    \"There must be something wrong,\" Mrs. V. concluded, after vainly trying  ruse after ruse to get a smile out of her servant girl.  \"Something is amiss.  I wonder if one of those well-dressed Kafirs from Potchefstroom  had been prowling about the farm and instilling in Anna's simple mind  all kinds of silly notions, about town flirts and black dandies,  silk dresses in Potchefstroom and similar vuilgoed (rubbish).  And if a town Kafir is going to marry Anna, where on earth am I going to get  a reliable servant to whom I could securely entrust my home when I have  occasion to go to town or to the seaside on a shorter or longer vacation?  Who could cook and attend to my husband's and children's peculiar wants,  if Anna is going to leave us?  It seems certain that Anna's heart  is not on the farm,\" she said to herself.  \"It was there right enough  when she went home last night, but it is clear that some one has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14555"],[0,"William Lloyd Garrison, the Abolitionist (#18)"],[1," came to him from a man quite as  penniless and friendless as himself. The man was Isaac Knapp, an old  companion of his in Newburyport, who had also worked with him in the  office of the _Genius_, in Baltimore. He was a practical printer, and  was precisely the sort of assistant that the young reformer needed at  this juncture in the execution of his purpose; a man like himself  acquainted with poverty, and of unlimited capacity for the endurance of  unlimited hardships. Together they worked out the financial problems  which blocked the way to the publication of the paper. The partners took  an office in Merchants' Hall building, then standing on the corner of  Congress and Water streets, Boston, which gave their joint enterprise a  local habitation. It had already a name. They obtained the use of types  in the printing office of the _Christian Examiner_, situated in the same  building. The foreman, Stephen Foster, through his ardent interest in  Abolition, made the three first numbers of the paper possible. The  publishers paid for the use of the types by working during the day at  the case in the _Examiner's_ office. They got the use of a press from  another foreman with Abolition sympathies, viz., James B. Yerrington,  then the printer of the Boston _Daily Advocate_. Thus were obtained the  four indispensables to the publication of the _Liberator_--types, a  press, an office, and an assistant.    When at length the offspring of such labor and sacrifices made its  appearance in the world, which was on January 1, 1831, it was, in point  of size, insignificant enough. It did not look as if its voice would  ever reach beyond the small dark chamber where it saw the light.  Picture, oh! reader, a wee sheet with four columns to the page,  measuring fourteen inches one way and nine and a quarter the other, and  you will get an idea of the diminutiveness of the _Liberator_ on the day  of its birth. The very paper on which it was printed was procured on  credit. To the ordinary observer it must have seemed such a weakling as  was certain to perish from inanition in the first few months of its  struggle for existence in the world of journalism. It was domiciled  during successive periods in four different rooms of the Merchant's Hall  building, until it reached No. 11, \"under the eaves,\" whence it issued  weekly for many years to call the nation to repentance. A photographic  impression of this cradle-room of the anti-slavery movement has been  left by Oliver Johnson, an eye-witness. Says Mr. Johnson: \"The dingy  walls; the small windows, bespattered with printer's ink; the press  standing in one corner; the composing-stands opposite; the long  editorial and mailing table, covered with newspapers; the bed of the  editor and publisher on the floor--all these make a picture never to be  forgotten.\" For the first eighteen months the partners toiled fourteen  hours a day, and subsisted \"chiefly upon bread and milk, a few cakes,  and a little fruit, obtained from a baker's shop opposite, and a petty  cake and fruit shop in the basement,\" and, alas, \"were on short commons  even at that.\" Amid such hard and grinding poverty was the _Liberator_  born. But the great end of the reformer glorified the mean surroundings:      \"O truth! O Freedom! how are ye still born    In the rude stable, in the manger nursed;    What humble hands unbar those gates of morn    Through which the splendors of the New Day burst.\"      About the brow of this \"infant crying in the night,\" shone aureole-like  the sunlit legend: _Our country is the world--our countrymen are  mankind._ The difference between this motto of the _Liberator_ and that  of the _Free Press_: _Our country, our whole country, and nothing but  our country_--measures the greatness of the revolution which had taken  place in the young editor. The grand lesson he had learned, than which  there is none greater, that beneath diversities of race, color, creed,  language, there is the one human principle, which makes all men kin. He  had learned at the age of twenty-five to know the mark of brotherhood  made by the Deity Himself: \"Behold! my brother is man, not because he is  American or Anglo-Saxon, or white or black, but because he is a  fellow-man,\" is the simple, sublime acknowledgment, which thenceforth he  was to make in his word and life.    It was Mr. Garrison's original design, as we have seen, to publish the  _Liberator_ from Washington. Lundy had, since the issue of the  _Prospectus_ for the new paper, removed the _Genius_ to the capital of  the nation. This move of Lundy rendered the establishment of a second  paper devoted to the abolition of slavery in the same place, of doubtful  utility, but, weighty as was this consideration from a mere business  point of view, in determining Garrison to locate the _Liberator_ in  another quarter, it was not decisive. Just what was the decisive  consideration, he reveals in his salutatory address in the _Liberator_.  Here it is:    \"During my recent tour for the purpose of exciting the minds of the  people by a series of discourses on the subject of slavery,\" he confides  to the reader, \"every place that I visited gave fresh evidence of the  fact, that a greater revolution in public sentiment was to be effected  in the free States--_and particularly in New England_--than at the  South. I found contempt more bitter, opposition more active, detraction  more relentless; prejudice more stubborn, and apathy more frozen than  among slaveowners themselves. Of course there were individual exceptions  to the contrary. This state of things afflicted, but did not dishearten  me. I determined, at every hazard, to lift up the standard of  emancipation in the eyes of the nation, _within sight of Bunker Hill,  and in the birthplace of liberty_.\" This final choice of Boston as a  base from which to operate against slavery was sagacious, and of the  greatest moment to the success of the experiment and to its effective  service to the cause.    If the reformer changed his original intention respecting the place of  publication for his paper, he made no alteration of his position on the  subject of slavery. \"I shall strenuously contend,\" he declares in the  salutatory, \"for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave population.\"  \"In Park Street Church,\" he goes on to add, \"on the Fourth of July,  1829, in an address on slavery, I unreflectingly assented to the popular  but pernicious doctrine of _gradual_ abolition. I seize this opportunity  to make a full and unequivocal recantation, and thus publicly to ask  pardon of my God, of my country, and of my brethren, the poor slaves,  for having uttered a sentiment so full of timidity, injustice, and  absurdity.\"    To those who find fault with his harsh language he makes reply: \"I  _will_ be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this  subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation.  No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell  him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell  the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it  has fallen--but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the  present. I am in earnest--I will not equivocate--I will not excuse--I  will not retreat a single inch--AND I WILL BE HEARD.\" Martin Luther's  \"Here I take my stand,\" was not braver or grander than the \"I will be  heard,\" of the American reformer. It did not seem possible that a young  man, without influence, without money, standing almost alone, could ever  make good those courageous words. The country, in Church and State, had  decreed silence on the subject of slavery; the patriotism of the North,  its commerce, its piety, its labor and capital had all joined hands to  smother agitation, and stifle the discussion of a question that  imperilled the peace and durability of Webster's glorious Union. But one  man, tearing the gag from his lips, defying all these, cried, \"Silence,  there shall not be!\" and forthwith the whole land began to talk on the  forbidden theme:      \"O small beginnings ye are great and strong,    Based on a faithful heart and weariless brain!    Ye build the future fair, ye conquer wrong.    Ye earn the crown, and wear it not in vain!\"              CHAPTER VI.        THE HEAVY WORLD IS MOVED.      Archimedes with his lever desired a place to stand that he might move  the world of matter. Garrison with his paper, having found a place for  his feet, demonstrated speedily his ability to push from its solid base  the world of mind. His plan was very simple, viz., to reveal slavery as  it then existed in its naked enormity, to the conscience of the North,  to be \"as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.\" And so, week  after week, he packed in the columns of the _Liberator_ facts, the most  damning facts, against slaveholders, their cruelty and tyranny. He  painted the woes of the slaves as if he, too, had been a slave. For the  first time the masters found a man who rebuked them as not before had  they been rebuked. Others may have equivocated, but this man called  things by their proper names, a spade, a spade, and sin, sin. Others may  have contented themselves with denunciations of the sins and with  excuses for the sinner, as a creature of circumstances, the victim of  ancestral transgressions, but this man offered no excuses for the  slave-holding sinner. Him and his sin he denounced in language, which  the Eternal puts only into the mouths of His prophets. It was, as he had  said, \"On this subject I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with  moderation.\" The strength and resources of his mother-tongue seemed to  him wholly inadequate for his needs, to express the transcendent  wickedness of slave-holding. All the harsh, the stern, the terrible and  tremendous energies of the English speech he drew upon, and launched at  slaveholders. Amid all of this excess of the"]]]
