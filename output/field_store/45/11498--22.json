Pieces of broken pots, with their rims  ornamented with very good imitations of basket-work, attest that the  lady potters of old followed the example given them by their still  more ancient mothers,--their designs are rude, but better than we can  make them without referring to the original.    [Illustration: Imitation of basket-work in Pottery.]    No want of water has here acted to drive the people away, as has been  the case further south. It is a perpetual succession of ridge and  valley, with a running stream or oozing bog, where ridge is separated  from ridge: the ridges become steeper and narrower as we approach  Mataka's.    I counted fifteen running burns of from one to ten yards wide in one  day's march of about six hours; being in a hilly or rather mountainous  region, they flow rapidly and have plenty of water-power. In July any  mere torrent ceases to flow, but these were brawling burns with water  too cold (61 deg.) for us to bathe in whose pores were all open by the  relaxing regions nearer the coast. The sound, so un-African, of  gushing water dashing over rocks was quite familiar to our ears.    This district, which rises up west of Mataka's to 3400 feet above the  sea, catches a great deal of the moisture brought up by the easterly  winds. Many of the trees are covered with lichens. While here we had  cold southerly breezes, and a sky so overcast every day after 10 A.M.,  that we could take no astronomical observations: even the latitude was  too poor to be much depended on. 12 deg. 53' S. may have been a few miles  from this.    The cattle, rather a small breed, black and white in patches, and  brown, with humps, give milk which is duly prized by these Waiyau. The  sheep are the large-tailed variety, and generally of a black colour.  Fowls and pigeons are the only other domestic animals we see, if we  except the wretched village dogs which our-poodle had immense delight  in chasing.    The Waiyau are far from a handsome race, but they are not the  prognathous beings one sees on the West Coast either. Their heads are  of a round shape; compact foreheads, but not particularly receding;  the alae nasi are flattened out; lips full, and with the women a small  lip-ring just turns them up to give additional thickness. Their style  of beauty is exactly that which was in fashion when the stone deities  were made in the caves of Elephanta and Kenora near Bombay. A  favourite mode of dressing the hair into little knobs, which was in  fashion there, is more common in some tribes than in this. The mouths  of the women would not be so hideous with a small lip-ring if they did  not file their teeth to points, but they seem strong and able for the  work which falls to their lot. The men are large, strong-boned  fellows, and capable of enduring great fatigue, they undergo a rite  which once distinguished the Jews about the age of puberty, and take a  new name on the occasion; this was not introduced by the Arabs, whose  advent is a recent event, and they speak of the time before they were  inundated with European manufactures in exchange for slaves, as quite  within their memory.    Young Mataka gave me a dish of peas, and usually brought something  every time he made a visit, he seems a nice boy, and his father, in  speaking of learning to read, said he and his companions could learn,  but he himself was too old. The soil seems very fertile, for the sweet  potatoes become very large, and we bought two loads of them for three  cubits and two needles; they quite exceeded 1 cwt. The maize becomes  very large too; one cob had 1600 seeds. The abundance of water, the  richness of soil, the available labour for building square houses, the  coolness of the climate, make this nearly as desirable a residence as  Magomero; but, alas! instead of three weeks' easy sail up the Zambesi  and Shire, we have spent four weary months in getting here: I shall  never cease bitterly to lament the abandonment of the Magomero  mission.    Moaning seems a favourite way of spending the time with some sick  folk. For the sake of the warmth, I allowed a Nassick boy to sleep in  my house; he and I had the same complaint, dysentery, and I was  certainly worse than he, but did not moan, while he played at it as  often as he was awake. I told him that people moaned only when too ill  to be sensible of what they were doing; the groaning ceased, though  he became worse.    Three sepoys played at groaning very vigorously outside my door; they  had nothing the matter with them, except perhaps fatigue, which we all  felt alike; as these fellows prevented my sleeping, I told them quite  civilly that, if so ill that they required to groan, they had better  move off a little way, as I could not sleep; they preferred the  verandah, and at once forbore.    The abundance of grain and other food is accompanied by great numbers  of rats or large mice, which play all manner of pranks by night; white  ants have always to be guarded against likewise. Anyone who would find  an antidote to drive them away would confer a blessing; the natural  check is the driver ant, which when it visits a house is a great pest  for a time, but it clears the others out.

He had sent plenty of cooked food almost every day. He asked  if we would slaughter the ox he would give here, or take it on; we  preferred to kill it at once. He came on the 28th with a good lot of  flour for us, and men to guide us to Nyassa, telling us that this was  Moembe, and his district extended all the way to the Lake: he would  not send us to Losewa, as that place had lately been plundered and  burned.    In general the chiefs have shown an anxiety to promote our safety. The  country is a mass of mountains. On leaving Mataka's we ascended  considerably, and about the end of the first day's march, near  Magola's village, the barometer showed our greatest altitude, about  3400 feet above the sea. There were villages of these mountaineers  everywhere, for the most part of 100 houses or more each. The springs  were made the most use of that they knew; the damp spots drained, and  the water given a free channel for use in irrigation further down:  most of these springs showed the presence of iron by the oxide oozing  out. A great many patches of peas are seen in full bearing and flower.  The trees are small, except in the hollows: there is plenty of grass  and flowers near streams and on the heights. The mountain-tops may  rise 2000 or 3000 feet above their flanks, along which we wind, going  perpetually up and down the steep ridges of which the country is but a  succession.    Looking at the geology of the district, the plateaux on each side of  the Rovuma are masses of grey sandstone, capped with masses of  ferruginous conglomerate; apparently an aqueous deposit. When we  ascend the Rovuma about sixty miles, a great many pieces and blocks of  silicified wood appear on the surface of the soil at the bottom of the  slope up the plateaux. This in Africa is a sure indication of the  presence of coal beneath, but it was not observed cropping out; the  plateaux are cut up in various directions by wadys well supplied with  grass and trees on deep and somewhat sandy soil: but at the confluence  of the Loendi highlands they appear in the far distance. In the sands  of the Loendi pieces of coal are quite common.[16]    Before reaching the confluence of the Rovuma and Loendi, or say about  ninety miles from the sea, the plateau is succeeded by a more level  country, having detached granitic masses shooting up some 500 or 700  feet. The sandstone of the plateau has at first been hardened, then  quite metamorphosed into a chocolate-coloured schist. As at Chilole  hill, we have igneous rocks, apparently trap, capped with masses of  beautiful white dolomite. We still ascend in altitude as we go  westwards, and come upon long tracts of gneiss with hornblende. The  gneiss is often striated, all the striae looking one way--sometimes  north and south, and at other times east and west. These rocks look as  if a stratified rock had been nearly melted, and the strata fused  together by the heat. From these striated rocks have shot up great  rounded masses of granite or syenite, whose smooth sides and crowns  contain scarcely any trees, and are probably from 3000 to 4000 feet  above the sea. The elevated plains among these mountain masses show  great patches of ferruginous conglomerate, which, when broken, look  like yellow haematite with madrepore holes in it: this has made the  soil of a red colour.

The deputy of Gregory IX. was the cardinal-deacon Otto, who  in 1226 had already discharged the humbler office of nuncio in England.  It was believed that the legate was sent at the special request of  Henry III., and despite the remonstrances of the Archbishop of  Canterbury. Those most unfriendly to the legate were won over by his  irreproachable conduct. He rejected nearly all gifts. He was unwearied  in preaching peace; travelled to the north to settle outstanding  differences between Henry and the King of Scots, and thence hurried to  the west to prolong the truce with Llewelyn. His zeal for the  reformation of abuses made the canons of the national council, held  under his presidency at St. Paul's on November 18, 1237, an epoch in  the history of our ecclesiastical jurisprudence.    Despite his efforts the legate remained unpopular. The pluralists and  nepotists, who feared his severity, joined with the foes of all  taxation and the enemies of all foreigners in denouncing the legate. To  avoid the danger of poison, he thought it prudent to make his own  brother his master cook. During the council of London it was necessary  to escort him from his lodgings and back again with a military force.  In the council itself the claim of high-born clerks to receive  benefices in plurality found a spokesman in so respectable a prelate as  Walter of Cantilupe, the son of a marcher baron, whom Otto had just  enthroned in his cathedral at Worcester, and the legate, \"fearing for  his skin,\" was suspected of mitigating the severity of his principles  to win over the less greedy of the friends of vested interests. His  Roman followers knew and cared little about English susceptibilities,  and feeling was so strong against them that any mischance might excite  an explosion. Such an accident occurred on St. George's day, April 23,  1238, when the legate was staying with the Austin Canons of Oseney,  near Oxford, while the king was six miles off at Abingdon. Some of the  masters of the university went to Oseney to pay their respects to the  cardinal, and were rudely repulsed by the Italian porter. Irritated at  this discourtesy, they returned with a host of clerks, who forced their  way into the abbey. Amongst them was a poor Irish chaplain, who made  his way to the kitchen to beg for food. The chief cook, the legate's  brother, threw a pot of scalding broth into the Irishman's face. A  clerk from the march of Wales shot the cook dead with an arrow. A  fierce struggle followed, in the midst of which Otto, hastily donning  the garb of his hosts, took refuge in the tower of their church, where  he was besieged by the infuriated clerks, until the king sent soldiers  from Abingdon to release him. Otto thereupon laid Oxford under an  interdict, suspended all lectures, and put thirty masters into prison.  English opinion, voiced by the diocesan, Grosseteste, held that the  cardinal's servants had provoked the riot, and found little to blame in  the violence of the clerks.    In 1239 Gregory IX. began his final conflict with Frederick II., and  demanded the support of all Europe. As before, from 1227 to 1230, the  pressure of the papal necessity was at once felt in England. The legate  had to raise supplies at all costs. Crusaders were allowed to renounce  their vows for ready money. Every visitation or conference became an  excuse for procurations and fees. Presents were no longer rejected, but  rather greedily solicited. On the pretence that it was necessary to  reform the Scottish Church, \"which does not recognise the Roman Church  as its sole mother and metropolitan,\" Otto excited the indignation of  Alexander II. by attempts to extend his jurisdiction to Scotland,  hitherto unvisited by legates. In England his claims soon grew beyond  all bearing. At last he demanded a fifth of all clerical goods to  enable the pope to finance the anti-imperial crusade. Even this was  more endurable than the order received from Rome that 300 clerks of  Roman families should be \"provided\" to benefices in England in order  that Gregory might obtain the support of their relatives against  Frederick. Both as feudal suzerain and as spiritual despot, the pope  lorded it over England as fully as his uncle Innocent III.    Weakness, piety, and self-interest combined to make Henry III.  acquiesce in the legate's exactions. \"I neither wish nor dare,\" said  he, \"to oppose the lord pope in anything.\" The union of king and legate  was irresistible. The lay opposition was slow and feeble. Gilbert  Marshal, though showing no lack of spirit, was not the man to play the  part which his brother Richard had filled so effectively. Richard, Earl  of Cornwall, who constituted himself the spokesman of the magnates,  made a special grievance of the marriage of Simon of Montfort with his  sister Eleanor. England, he said, was like a vineyard with a broken  hedge, so that all that went by could steal the grapes. He took arms,  and subscribed the first of the long series of plans of constitutional  reform that the reign was to witness, according to which the king was  to be guided by a chosen body of counsellors. But at the crisis of the  movement he held back, having accomplished nothing.    There was more vigour in the ecclesiastical opposition. Robert  Grosseteste,[1] a Suffolk man of humble birth, had already won for  himself a position of unique distinction at Oxford and Paris. A teacher  of rare force, a scholar of unexampled range, a thinker of daring  originality, and a writer who had touched upon almost every known  subject, he was at the height of his fame when, in 1235, his appointment  as Bishop of Lincoln gave the fullest opportunities for the employment  of his great gifts in the public service. He was convinced that the  preoccupation of the clergy in worldly employment and the constant  aggressions of the civil upon the ecclesiastical courts lay at the root  of the evils of the time. His conviction brought him into conflict with  the king rather than the legate, though for the moment his absorption in  the cares of his diocese distracted his attention from general  questions. The bishops generally had become so hostile that Otto shrank  from meeting them in another council, and strove to get money by  negotiating individually with the leading churchmen. The old foe of  papal usurpations, Robert Twenge, renewed his agitation on behalf of the  rights of patrons, and the clergy of Berkshire drew up a remonstrance  against Otto's extortions.        [1] For Grosseteste, see F.S. Stevenson, _Robert Grosseteste,      Bishop of Lincoln_ (1899).    Archbishop Edmund saw the need of opposing both legate and king; but he  was hampered by his ecclesiastical and political principles, and still  more, perhaps, by the magnitude of the rude task thrown upon him. He  had set before himself the ideal of St. Thomas, not only in the  asceticism of his private life, but in his zeal for his see and the  Church. But few men were more unlike the strong-willed and bellicose  martyr of Canterbury than the gentle and yielding saint of Abingdon. A  plentiful crop of quarrels, however, soon showed that Edmund had, in  one respect, copied only too faithfully the example of his predecessor.  He was engaged in a controversy of some acerbity with the Archbishop of  York, and he was involved in a long wrangle with the monks of his  cathedral, which took him to Rome soon after the legate's arrival. He  got little satisfaction there, and found a whole sea of troubles to  overwhelm him on his return. At last came the demand of the fifth from  Otto. Edmund joined in the opposition of his brethren to this exaction,  but his attitude was complicated by his other difficulties. Leaning in  his weakness on the pope, he found that Gregory was a taskmaster rather  than a director. At last he paid his fifth, but, broken in health and  spirits, he was of no mind to withstand the demands of the Roman clerks  for benefices. If he could not be another St. Thomas defending the  liberties of the Church, he could at least withdraw like his prototype  from the strife, and find a refuge in a foreign house of religion.  Seeking out St. Thomas's old haunt at Pontigny, he threw himself with  ardour into the austere Cistercian life. On the advice of his  physicians, he soon sought a healthier abode with the canons of Soisy,  in Brie, at whose house he died on November 16, 1240. His body was  buried at Pontigny in the still abiding minster which had witnessed the  devotions of Becket and Langton, and miracles were soon wrought at his  tomb. Within eight years of his death he was declared a saint; and  Henry, who had thwarted him in life, and even opposed his canonisation,  was among the first of the pilgrims who worshipped at his shrine. It  needed a tougher spirit and a stronger character than Edmund's to  grapple with the thorny problems of his age.    The retirement of the archbishop enabled Otto to carry through his  business, and withdraw from England on January 7, 1241. On August 21  Gregory IX. died, with his arch-enemy at the gates of Rome and all his  plans for the time frustrated. High-minded, able and devout, he wagered  the whole fortunes of the papacy on the result of his secular struggle  with the emperor. In Italy as in England, the spiritual hegemony of the  Roman see and the spiritual influence of the western Church were  compromised by his exaltation of ecclesiastical politics over religion.    The monks of Christ Church won court favour by electing as archbishop,  Boniface of Savoy, Bishop-elect of Belley, one of the queen's uncles.  There was no real resistance to the appointment, though a prolonged  vacancy in the papacy made it impossible for him to receive formal  confirmation until 1243, and it was not until 1244 that he condescended  to visit his new province. Meanwhile his kinsmen were carrying  everything before them. Richard of Cornwall lost his"]]]
