He can eat almost anything and everything, but he cannot long stand  self-contemplation. The human mind can accomplish wonders in the way  of work, but it is soon wrecked when directed into the channels of  worry.\"[27] In other words, hands off!--or rather, minds off! Don't  get ideas that make you think about your body. The surest way to  disarrange any function is to think about it. It is a stout heart that  will not change its beat with a frequent finger on the pulse, and a  hearty stomach that will not \"act up\" under attention. \"Judicious  neglect\" is a good motto for most occasions. Take no anxious thought  if you would be well. Know enough about your body to counteract false  suggestions; fulfil the common-sense laws of hygiene,--eight hours in  bed, plenty of exercise and fresh air, and three square meals a day.  Then forget all about it. \"A mental representation is already a  sensation,\"[28] and we have enough legitimate sensations without  manufacturing others.    [Footnote 27: Sadler: _Physiology of Faith and Fear_.]    [Footnote 28: DuBois: _Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders_.]    =From Real Life.= Startling indeed are the tricks that we can play on  ourselves by disregarding these laws. A patient who was unnecessarily  concerned about his stomach once came to me in great alarm, exhibiting  a distinct, well-defined swelling about the size of a match-box in the  region of his stomach. I looked at it, laughed, and told him to forget  it. Whereupon it promptly disappeared. The first segment of the rectus  muscle had tied itself up into a knot, under the stimulus of anxious  attention.    Another patient appeared at my door one day saying, \"Look here!\"  Examination showed that her abdomen was swollen to the size of more  than a six-months pregnancy. As it happened, this woman had a friend  who a short time before had developed a pseudo, or hysterical  pregnancy which continued for several months. My patient, accepting  the suggestion, was prepared to imitate her. I gave her a punch or  two and told her to go and dress for luncheon. In the afternoon she  had returned to her normal size.    Another woman, suffering from chronic constipation, was firmly  convinced that her bowels could not move without a cathartic, which I  refused to give. However, I did give her some strychnine pills,  carefully explaining that they were not for her intestines and that  they would have no effect there. She did not believe me, and promptly  began to have an evacuation every day. It seems that sometimes two  wrong ideas are equal to a right one.    If doctors fully realized the power of suggestion, they would be more  careful than they sometimes are about suggesting symptoms by the  questions they ask their patients.    A patient of mine with locomotor-ataxia suffered from the usual train  of symptoms incident to that disease. It turned out, however, that  many of the symptoms had been suggested by the questions of former  physicians who had asked him whether he had certain symptoms and  certain disabilities. The patient had answered in the negative and  then promptly developed the suggested symptoms. When I told him what  had happened, these false symptoms disappeared leaving only those  which had a real physical foundation.    Another patient, a young girl, complained of a definite localized  pain in her arm, and told me that she was suffering from angina  pectoris. As we do not expect to find this disease in a young person,  I asked her where she got such an idea. \"Dr. ---- told me so last  May.\" \"Did you feel the pain in this same place before that time?\" I  asked. She thought a minute and then answered: \"Why no, I had a pain  around my heart but I did not notice it in my arm until after that  consultation.\" The wise physician lets his patients describe their own  symptoms without suggesting others by the implication of his  questions.    =Autosuggestion.= Of course we must remember that an idea cannot  always work itself out immediately. Conditions are not always ripe. It  often lies fallow a long time, buried in the subconscious, only to  come up again as an autosuggestion, a suggestion from the self to the  self. If some one tells us that nervous insomnia is disastrous, and we  believe it, we shall probably store up the idea until the next time  that chance conditions keep us awake. Then the autosuggestion \"bobs  up,\" common sense is side-tracked, we toss and worry--and of course  stay awake. An autosuggestion often repeated becomes the strongest of  suggestions, successfully opposing most outside ideas that would  counteract it,--reason enough for seeing to it that our  autosuggestions are of the healthful variety.    At the base of every psycho-neurosis is an unhealthful suggestion.  This is never the ultimate cause. There are other forces at work. But  the suggestion is the material out of which those other forces weave  the neurosis. Suggestibility is one of the earmarks of nervousness. A  sensible and sturdy spirit, stable enough to maintain its equilibrium,  is a fairly good antidote to attack. \"As a man thinketh in his heart,  so is he.\"      WHY FEELINGS COUNT    =The Emotions Again.= It seems impossible to discuss any psychological  principle without finally coming back to the subject of emotions. It  truly seems that all roads lead to the instincts and to the emotions  which drive them. And so, as we follow the trail of suggestion, we  suddenly turn a corner and find ourselves back at our  starting-point--the emotional life. Like all other ideas, suggestions  get tied up with emotions to form complexes, of which the  driving-power is the emotion.    If we look into our emotional life, we find, besides the true  emotions, with which we have become familiar in Chapter III, a great  number of feelings or feeling-tones which color either pleasurably or  painfully our emotions and our ideas. On the one hand there are  pleasure, joy, exaltation, courage, cheer, confidence, satisfaction;  and on the other, pain, sorrow, depression, apprehension, gloom,  distrust, and dissatisfaction. Every complex which is laid away in  our subconscious is tinted, either slightly or intensely, with its  specific feeling-tone.    =Emotions--Tonic and Poisonous.= All this is most important because of  one vital fact; joyful emotions invigorate, and sorrowful emotions  depress; pleasurable emotions stimulate, and painful emotions burden;  satisfying emotions revitalize, and unsatisfying emotions sap the  strength. In other words, our bodies are made for courage, confidence,  and cheer. Any other atmosphere puts them out of their element,  handicapped by abnormal conditions for which they were never  fashioned. We were written in a major key, and when we try to change  over into minor tones we get sadly out of tune.    There is another factor; painful emotions make us fall to pieces,  while pleasant emotions bind us together. We can see why this is so  when we remember that powerful emotions like fear and anger tend to  dissociate all but themselves, to split up the mind into separate  parts and to force out of consciousness everything but their own  impulse. Morton Prince in his elaborate studies of the cases of  multiple personality, Miss Beauchamp and B.C.A., found repeatedly that  he had only to hypnotize the patient and replace painful, depressing  complexes by healthy, happy ones to change her from a weak, worn-out  person, complaining of fatigue, insomnia, and innumerable aches and  pains, into a vigorous woman, for the time being completely well. On  this point he says:         Exalting emotions have an intense synthesizing effect, while       depressing emotions have a disintegrating effect. With the       inrushing of depressive memories or ideas ... there is suddenly       developed a condition of fatigue, ill-being and disintegration,       followed after waking by a return or accentuation of all the       neurasthenic symptoms. If on the other hand, exalting ideas and       memories are introduced and brought into the limelight of       attention, there is almost a magical reversal of processes. The       patient feels strong and energetic, the neurasthenic symptoms       disappear and he exhibits a capacity for sustained effort. He       becomes re-vitalized, so to speak.[29]    [Footnote 29: Prince: _Psycho-therapeutics_, Chap. I.]    In cases like this the needed strength and energy are not lost; they  are merely side-tracked, but the person feels as weak as though he  were physically ill.      BODILY RESPONSE TO EMOTIONAL STATES    =Secretions.= Let us look more carefully into some of the  physiological processes involved in emotional changes. Among the most  apparent of bodily responses are the various external secretions.  Tears, the secretion of the lachrymal glands in response to an  emotion, are too common a phenomenon to arouse comment. It is common  knowledge that clammy hands and a dry mouth betray emotion. Every  nursing mother knows that she dares not become too disturbed lest her  milk should dry up or change in character. Most people have  experienced an increase in urine in times of excitement; recently  physiologists have discovered the presence of sugar in the urine of  students at the time of athletic contests and difficult  examinations.[30] We have seen what an important role the various  internal secretions, such as the adrenal and thyroid secretions play  in fitting the body for flight and combat, and how large a part fear  and anger have in their production. Constant over-production of these  secretions through chronic states of worry is responsible for many a  distressing symptom.    [Footnote 30: Cannon.]    Most graphic evidence of the disturbance of secretions by emotion is  found in the response of the salivary and gastric glands to painful or  pleasurable thinking. As these are the secretions which play the  largest part in the digestive processes, they lead us naturally to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14988"],[0,"Cicero's Tusculan Disputations (#18)"],[1,"crush us if we give way, so the soul by exerting itself  resists the whole weight that would oppress it; but if it yields, it is  so pressed that it cannot support itself. And if we consider things  truly, the soul should exert itself in every pursuit, for that is the  only security for its doing its duty. But this should be principally  regarded in pain, that we must not do anything timidly, or dastardly,  or basely, or slavishly, or effeminately, and, above all things, we  must dismiss and avoid that Philoctetean sort of outcry. A man is  allowed sometimes to groan, but yet seldom; but it is not permissible  even in a woman to howl; for such a noise as this is forbidden, by the  twelve tables, to be used even at funerals. Nor does a wise or brave  man ever groan, unless when he exerts himself to give his resolution  greater force, as they who run in the stadium make as much noise as  they can. The wrestlers, too, do the same when they are training; and  the boxers, when they aim a blow with the cestus at their adversary,  give a groan, not because they are in pain, or from a sinking of their  spirits, but because their whole body is put upon the stretch by the  throwing-out of these groans, and the blow comes the stronger.    XXIV. What! they who would speak louder than ordinary are they  satisfied with working their jaws, sides, or tongue or stretching the  common organs of speech and utterance? The whole body and every muscle  is at full stretch if I may be allowed the expression; every nerve is  exerted to assist their voice. I have actually seen the knees of Marcus  Antonius touch the ground when he was speaking with vehemence for  himself, with relation to the Varian law. For, as the engines you throw  stones or darts with throw them out with the greater force the more  they are strained and drawn back; so it is in speaking, running, or  boxing--the more people strain themselves, the greater their force.  Since, therefore, this exertion has so much influence--if in a moment  of pain groans help to strengthen the mind, let us use them; but if  they be groans of lamentation, if they be the expression of weakness or  abjectness, or unmanly weeping, then I should scarcely call him a man  who yielded to them. For even supposing that such groaning could give  any ease, it still should be considered whether it were consistent with  a brave and resolute man. But if it does not ease our pain, why should  we debase ourselves to no purpose? For what is more unbecoming in a man  than to cry like a woman? But this precept which is laid down with  respect to pain is not confined to it. We should apply this exertion of  the soul to everything else. Is anger inflamed? is lust excited? we  must have recourse to the same citadel, and apply to the same arms. But  since it is pain which we are at present discussing, we will let the  other subjects alone. To bear pain, then, sedately and calmly, it is of  great use to consider with all our soul, as the saying is, how noble it  is to do so, for we are naturally desirous (as I said before, but it  cannot be too often repeated) and very much inclined to what is  honorable, of which, if we discover but the least glimpse, there is  nothing which we are not prepared to undergo and suffer to attain it.  From this impulse of our minds, this desire for genuine glory and  honorable conduct, it is that such dangers are supported in war, and  that brave men are not sensible of their wounds in action, or, if they  are sensible of them, prefer death to the departing but the least step  from their honor. The Decii saw the shining swords of their enemies  when they were rushing into the battle. But the honorable character and  the glory of the death which they were seeking made all fear of death  of little weight. Do you imagine that Epaminondas groaned when he  perceived that his life was flowing out with his blood? No; for he left  his country triumphing over the Lacedaemonians, whereas he had found it  in subjection to them. These are the comforts, these are the things  that assuage the greatest pain.    XXV. You may ask, How the case is in peace? What is to be done at home?  How we are to behave in bed? You bring me back to the philosophers, who  seldom go to war. Among these, Dionysius of Heraclea, a man certainly  of no resolution, having learned fortitude of Zeno, quitted it on being  in pain; for, being tormented with a pain in his kidneys, in bewailing  himself he cried out that those things were false which he had formerly  conceived of pain. And when his fellow-disciple, Cleanthes, asked him  why he had changed his opinion, he answered, \"That the case of any man  who had applied so much time to philosophy, and yet was unable to bear  pain, might be a sufficient proof that pain is an evil; that he himself  had spent many years at philosophy, and yet could not bear pain: it  followed, therefore, that pain was an evil.\" It is reported that  Cleanthes on that struck his foot on the ground, and repeated a verse  out of the Epigonae:        Amphiaraus, hear'st thou this below?    He meant Zeno: he was sorry the other had degenerated from him.    But it was not so with our friend Posidonius, whom I have often seen  myself; and I will tell you what Pompey used to say of him: that when  he came to Rhodes, after his departure from Syria, he had a great  desire to hear Posidonius, but was informed that he was very ill of a  severe fit of the gout; yet he had great inclination to pay a visit to  so famous a philosopher. Accordingly, when he had seen him, and paid  his compliments, and had spoken with great respect of him, he said he  was very sorry that he could not hear him lecture. \"But indeed you  may,\" replied the other, \"nor will I suffer any bodily pain to occasion  so great a man to visit me in vain.\" On this Pompey relates that, as he  lay on his bed, he disputed with great dignity and fluency on this very  subject: that nothing was good but what was honest; and that in his  paroxysms he would often say, \"Pain, it is to no purpose;  notwithstanding you are troublesome, I will never acknowledge you an  evil.\" And in general all celebrated and notorious afflictions become  endurable by disregarding them.    XXVI. Do we not observe that where those exercises called gymnastic are  in esteem, those who enter the lists never concern themselves about  dangers? that where the praise of riding and hunting is highly  esteemed, they who practice these arts decline no pain? What shall I  say of our own ambitious pursuits or desire of honors? What fire have  not candidates run through to gain a single vote? Therefore Africanus  had always in his hands Xenophon, the pupil of Socrates, being  particularly pleased with his saying, that the same labors were not  equally heavy to the general and to the common man, because the honor  itself made the labor lighter to the general. But yet, so it happens,  that even with the illiterate vulgar an idea of honor is of great  influence, though they cannot understand what it is. They are led by  report and common opinion to look on that as honorable which has the  general voice. Not that I would have you, should the multitude be ever  so fond of you, rely on their judgment, nor approve of everything which  they think right: you must use your own judgment. If you are satisfied  with yourself when you have approved of what is right, you will not  only have the mastery over yourself (which I recommended to you just  now), but over everybody, and everything. Lay this down, then, as a  rule, that a great capacity, and lofty elevation of soul, which  distinguishes itself most by despising and looking down with contempt  on pain, is the most excellent of all things, and the more so if it  does not depend on the people and does not aim at applause, but derives  its satisfaction from itself. Besides, to me, indeed, everything seems  the more commendable the less the people are courted, and the fewer  eyes there are to see it. Not that you should avoid the public, for  every generous action loves the public view; yet no theatre for virtue  is equal to a consciousness of it.    XXVII. And let this be principally considered: that this bearing of  pain, which I have often said is to be strengthened by an exertion of  the soul, should be the same in everything. For you meet with many who,  through a desire of victory, or for glory, or to maintain their rights,  or their liberty, have boldly received wounds, and borne themselves up  under them; and yet those very same persons, by relaxing that  intenseness of their minds, were unequal to bearing the pain of a  disease; for they did not support themselves under their former  sufferings by reason or philosophy, but by inclination and glory.  Therefore some barbarians and savage people are able to fight very  stoutly with the sword, but cannot bear sickness like men; but the  Grecians, men of no great courage, but as wise as human nature will  admit of, cannot look an enemy in the face, yet the same will bear to  be visited with sickness tolerably, and with a sufficiently manly  spirit; and the Cimbrians and Celtiberians are very alert in battle,  but bemoan themselves in sickness. For nothing can be consistent which  has not reason for its foundation. But when you see those who are led  by inclination or opinion, not retarded by pain in their pursuits, nor  hindered by it from succeeding in them, you may conclude, either that  pain is no evil, or that, notwithstanding you may choose to call an  evil whatever is disagreeable and contrary to nature, yet it is so very  trifling an evil that it may so effectually be got the better of by  virtue as quite to disappear. And I would have you think of this night  and day; for this argument will spread itself, and take up more room  some time or other, and not be confined to pain alone; for if the  motives to all our actions are to avoid disgrace and acquire honor, we  may not"]]]
