King's Mountain, October, 1780.--Cornwallis now thought that  resistance surely was at an end. He sent an expedition to the  settlements on the lower slopes of the Alleghany Mountains to get  recruits, for there were many loyalists in that region. Suddenly from  the mountains and from the settlements in Tennessee rode a body of armed  frontiersmen. They found the British soldiers encamped on the top of  King's Mountain. In about an hour they had killed or captured every  British soldier.    [Illustration: THE SOUTHERN CAMPAIGNS.]    [Sidenote: General Greene.]    [Sidenote: Morgan's victory of the Cowpens, 1781.]    160. The Cowpens, 1781.--General Greene was now sent to the South  to take charge of the resistance to Cornwallis. A great soldier and a  great organizer Greene found that he needed all his abilities. His  coming gave new spirit to the survivors of Gates's army. He gathered  militia from all directions and marched toward Cornwallis. Dividing his  army into two parts, he sent General Daniel Morgan to threaten  Cornwallis from one direction, while he threatened him from another  direction. Cornwallis at once became uneasy and sent Tarleton to drive  Morgan away, but the hero of many hard-fought battles was not easily  frightened. He drew up his little force so skillfully that in a very few  minutes the British were nearly all killed or captured.    [Illustration: GENERAL MORGAN THE HERO OF COWPENS.]    [Sidenote: Greene's retreat.]    [Sidenote: The Battle of Guilford, 1781.]    161. The Guilford Campaign, 1781.--Cornwallis now made a desperate  attempt to capture the Americans, but Greene and Morgan joined forces  and marched diagonally across North Carolina. Cornwallis followed so  closely that frequently the two armies seemed to be one. When, however,  the river Dan was reached, there was an end of marching, for Greene had  caused all the boats to be collected at one spot. His men crossed and  kept the boats on their side of the river. Soon Greene found himself  strong enough to cross the river again to North Carolina. He took up a  very strong position near Guilford Court House. Cornwallis attacked. The  Americans made a splendid defense before Greene ordered a retreat, and  the British won the battle of Guilford. But their loss was so great that  another victory of the same kind would have destroyed the British army.  As it was, Greene had dealt it such a blow that Cornwallis left his  wounded at Guilford and set out as fast as he could for the seacoast.  Greene pursued him for some distance and then marched southward  to Camden.    [Sidenote: Greene's later campaigns, 1871-83.]    162. Greene's Later Campaigns.--At Hobkirk's Hill, near Camden, the  British soldiers who had been left behind by Cornwallis attacked Greene.  But he beat them off and began the siege of a fort on the frontier of  South Carolina. The British then marched up from Charleston, and Greene  had to fall back. Then the British marched back to Charleston and  abandoned the interior of South Carolina to the Americans. There was  only one more battle in the South--at Eutaw Springs. Greene was defeated  there, too, but the British abandoned the rest of the Carolinas and  Georgia with the exception of Savannah and Charleston. In these  wonderful campaigns with a few good soldiers Greene had forced the  British from the Southern states. He had lost every battle. He had won  every campaign.    [Sidenote: Lafayette and Cornwallis, 1781.]    163. Cornwallis in Virginia, 1781.--There were already two small  armies in Virginia,--the British under Arnold, the Americans under  Lafayette. Cornwallis now marched northward from Wilmington and added  the troops in Virginia to his own force; Arnold he sent to New York.  Cornwallis then set out to capture Lafayette and his men. Together they  marched from salt water across Virginia to the mountains--and then they  marched back to salt water again. Cornwallis had called Lafayette \"the  boy\" and had declared that \"the boy should not escape him.\" Finally  Cornwallis fortified Yorktown, and Lafayette settled down at  Williamsburg. And there they still were in September, 1781.    [Sidenote: The French at Newport, 1780.]    [Sidenote: Plans of the allies, 1781.]    164. Plans of the Allies.--In 1780 the French government had sent  over a strong army under Rochambeau. It was landed at Newport. It  remained there a year to protect the vessels in which it had come from  France from capture by a stronger British fleet that had at once  appeared off the mouth of the harbor. Another French fleet and another  French army were in the West Indies. In the summer of 1781 it became  possible to unite all these French forces, and with the Americans to  strike a crushing blow at the British. Just at this moment Cornwallis  shut himself up in Yorktown, and it was determined to besiege him there.    [Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1783.]    [Illustration: The Siege of Yorktown.]    [Sidenote: The march to the Chesapeake.]    [Sidenote: Combat between the French and the British fleets.]    [Surrender of Yorktown, October 19, 1781. _Higginson_, 211-212.]    165. Yorktown, September-October, 1781.--Rochambeau led his men to  New York and joined the main American army. Washington now took command  of the allied forces. He pretended that he was about to attack New York  and deceived Clinton so completely that Clinton ordered Cornwallis to  send some of his soldiers to New York. But the allies were marching  southward through Philadelphia before Clinton realized what they were  about. The French West India fleet under De Grasse reached one end of  the Chesapeake Bay at the same time the allies reached the other end.  The British fleet attacked it and was beaten off. There was now no hope  for Cornwallis. No help could reach him by sea. The soldiers of the  allies outnumbered him two to one. On October 17, 1781, four years to a  day since the surrender of Burgoyne, a drummer boy appeared on the  rampart of Yorktown and beat a parley. Two days later the British  soldiers marched out to the good old British tune of \"The world turned  upside down,\" and laid down their arms.    [Sidenote: Treaty of Peace, 1783.]    166. Treaty of Peace, 1783.--This disaster put an end to British  hopes of conquering America. But it was not until September, 1783, that  Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay brought the negotiations  for peace to an end. Great Britain acknowledged the independence of the  United States. The territory of the United States was defined as  extending from the Great Lakes to the thirty-first parallel of latitude  and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Spain had joined the United  States and France in the war. Spanish soldiers had conquered Florida,  and Spain kept Florida at the peace. In this way Spanish Florida and  Louisiana surrounded the United States on the south and the west.  British territory bounded the United States on the north and the  northeast.

Unless where several instruments are engaged we do not  recommend the introduction of the violin: although in some respects  the finest of all solo instruments, it is apt to sound thin and shrill  when employed on mere inexpressive dance tunes, and played by a mere  dance player.    Invitations to a ball should be issued in the name of the lady of the  house, and written on small note paper of the best quality. Elegant  printed forms, some of them printed in gold or silver, are to be  had at every stationer's by those who prefer them. The paper may be  gilt-edged, but not coloured. The sealing-wax used should be of some  delicate hue.    An invitation to a ball should be sent out at least ten days before  the evening appointed. A fortnight, three weeks, and even a month may  be allowed in the way of notice.    Not more than two or three days should be permitted to elapse before  you reply to an invitation of this kind. The reply should always be  addressed to the lady of the house, and should be couched in the same  person as the invitation. The following are the forms generally in  use:--        Mrs. Molyneux requests the honour of Captain Hamilton's      company at an evening party, on Monday, March the 11th      instant.        _Dancing will begin at Nine o'clock_.        Thursday, March 1st.           *       *       *       *       *        Captain Hamilton has much pleasure in accepting Mrs.      Molyneux's polite invitation for Monday evening, March the      11th instant.        Friday, March 2nd.    The old form of \"presenting compliments\" is now out of fashion.    If Mrs. Molyneux writes to Captain Hamilton in the first person, as  \"My dear Sir,\" he is bound in etiquette to reply \"My dear Madam.\"    The lady who gives a ball[A] should endeavour to secure an equal  number of dancers of both sexes. Many private parties are spoiled by  the preponderance of young ladies, some of whom never get partners at  all, unless they dance with each other.    A room should in all cases be provided for the accommodation of  the ladies. In this room there ought to be several looking-glasses;  attendants to assist the fair visitors in the arrangement of their  hair and dress; and some place in which the cloaks and shawls can be  laid in order, and found at a moment's notice. It is well to affix  tickets to the cloaks, giving a duplicate at the same time to each  lady, as at the public theatres and concert-rooms. Needles and thread  should also be at hand, to repair any little accident incurred in  dancing.    Another room should be devoted to refreshments, and kept amply  supplied with coffee, lemonade, ices, wine and biscuits during the  evening. Where this cannot be arranged, the refreshments should be  handed round between the dances.    The question of supper is one which so entirely depends on the means  of those who give a ball or evening party, that very little can be  said upon it in a treatise of this description. Where money is no  object, it is of course always preferable to have the whole supper,  \"with all appliances and means to boot,\" sent in from some first-rate  house. It spares all trouble whether to the entertainers or  their servants, and relieves the hostess of every anxiety. Where  circumstances render such a course imprudent, we would only observe  that a home-provided supper, however simple, should be good of its  kind, and abundant in quantity. Dancers are generally hungry people,  and feel themselves much aggrieved if the supply of sandwiches proves  unequal to the demand. Great inconvenience is often experienced by  the difficulty of procuring cabs at the close of an evening party.  Gentlemen who have been dancing, and are unprepared for walking,  object to go home on foot, or seek vehicles for their wives and  daughters. Female servants who have been in attendance upon the  visitors during a whole evening ought not to be sent out. If even  men-servants are kept, they may find it difficult to procure as many  cabs as are necessary. The best thing that the giver of a private  ball can do under these circumstances, is to engage a policeman with  a lantern to attend on the pavement during the evening, and to give  notice during the morning at a neighbouring cab-stand, so as to ensure  a sufficient number of vehicles at the time when they are likely to be  required.    [Footnote A: It will be understood that we use the word \"ball\" to  signify a private party, where there is dancing, as well as a public  ball.]           *       *       *       *       *    II.--BALL-ROOM TOILETTE.      LADIES.    The style of a lady's dress is a matter so entirely dependent on  age, means and fashion, that we can offer but little advice upon it.  Fashion is so variable, that statements which are true of it to-day  may be false a month hence. Respecting no institution of modern  society is it so difficult to pronounce half a dozen permanent rules.    We may perhaps be permitted to suggest the following leading  principles; but we do so with diffidence. Rich colours harmonize with  rich brunette complexions and dark hair. Delicate colours are the most  suitable for delicate and fragile styles of beauty. Very young ladies  are never so suitably attired as in white. Ladies who dance should  wear dresses of light and diaphanous materials, such as _tulle_,  gauze, crape, net, &c., over coloured silk slips. Silk dresses are not  suitable for dancing. A married lady who dances only a few quadrilles  may wear _a decolletee_ silk dress with propriety.    Very stout persons should never wear white. It has the effect of  adding to the bulk of the figure.    Black and scarlet, or black and violet, are worn in mourning.    A lady in deep mourning should not dance at all.    However fashionable it may be to wear very long dresses, those ladies  who go to a ball with the intention of dancing and enjoying the  dance, should cause their dresses to be made short enough to clear  the ground. We would ask them whether it is not better to accept this  slight deviation from an absurd fashion, than to appear for three  parts of the evening in a torn and pinned-up skirt?    Well-made shoes, whatever their colour or material, and faultless  gloves, are indispensable to the effect of a ball-room toilette.    Much jewellery is out of place in a ball-room. Beautiful flowers,  whether natural or artificial, are the loveliest ornaments that a lady  can wear on these occasions.    GENTLEMEN.    A black suit, thin enamelled boots, a white neckcloth, and white or  delicate grey gloves, are the chief points of a gentleman's ball-room  toilette. He may wear an embroidered shirt; and his waistcoat may be  of silk. White waistcoats are no longer fashionable. Much display of  jewellery is no proof of good taste. A handsome watch-chain, with,  perhaps, the addition of a few costly trifles suspended to it, and  a set of shirt-studs, are the only adornments of this kind that a  gentleman should wear. The studs should be small, but good.[A]    A gentleman's dress is necessarily so simple that it admits of no  compromise in point of quality and style. The material should be the  best that money can procure, and the fashion unexceptionable. So  much of the outward man depends on his tailor, that we would urge no  gentleman to economise in this matter.    [Footnote A: See \"Etiquette for Gentlemen,\" Sec. VII.]           *       *       *       *       *    III.--ETIQUETTE OF THE BALL-ROOM.[A]      On entering the ball-room, the visitor should at once seek the lady  of the house, and pay his respects to her. Having done this, he may  exchange salutations with such friends and acquaintances as may be in  the room.    If the ball be a public one, and a gentleman desires to dance with  any lady to whom he is a stranger, he must apply to the master of the  ceremonies for an introduction.    Even in private balls, no gentleman can invite a lady to dance without  a previous introduction. This introduction should be effected through  the lady of the house, or a member of her family.    No lady should accept an invitation to dance from a gentleman to whom  she has not been introduced. In case any gentleman should commit the  error of so inviting her, she should not excuse herself on the plea of  a previous engagement, or of fatigue, as to do so would imply that  she did not herself attach due importance to the necessary ceremony  of introduction. Her best reply would be to the effect that she would  have much pleasure in accepting his invitation, if he would procure an  introduction to her. This observation may be taken as applying only to  public balls. At a private party the host and hostess are sufficient  guarantees for the respectability of their guests; and, although  a gentleman would show a singular want of knowledge of the laws of  society in acting as we have supposed, the lady who should reply  to him as if he were merely an impertinent stranger in a public  assembly-room, would be implying an affront to her entertainers.  The mere fact of being assembled together under the roof of a mutual  friend, is in itself a kind of general introduction of the guests to  each other.    An introduction given for the mere purpose of enabling a lady and  gentleman to go through a dance together, does not constitute an  acquaintanceship. The lady is at liberty to pass the gentleman in the  park the next day without recognition.    No gentleman should venture to bow to a lady upon the strength of a  ball-room introduction, unless she does him the honour to recognize  him first. If he commits this solecism he must not be surprised to  find that she does not return his salutation.    No gentleman should accept an invitation to a ball if he does not  dance. When ladies are present who would be pleased to receive an  invitation, those gentleman who hold themselves aloof are guilty, not  only of a negative, but a positive act of neglect.    To"]]]
