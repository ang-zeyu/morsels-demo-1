From this point he was  conveyed to Holland, and from Holland he returned to Canada.    Soon after his return he joined two Jesuit fathers who were to visit a  mission station of the Jesuits amongst the Onondagas (Iroquois) on a  lakelet about thirty miles south-east of the present city of  Rochester. The Iroquois (whose language Radisson had learnt to speak)  received them with apparent friendliness, and there they passed the  winter. But in the spring Radisson found out that the Onondaga  Iroquois were intending to massacre the whole of the mission.  Instructed by him, the Jesuits pretended to have no suspicions of the  coming attack, but all the while they were secretly building canoes at  their fort. As soon as they were ready for flight, and the sun of  April had completely melted the ice in the River Oswego, the French  missionaries invited the Onondagas to a great feast, no doubt making  out that it was part of the Easter festivities sanctioned by the  Church. They pointed out to their guests that from religious motives  as well as those of politeness it was essential that the _whole_ of  the food provided should be eaten, \"nothing was to be left on the  plate\". They set before their savage guests an enormous banquet of  maize puddings, roast pigs, roast ducks, game birds, and fish of many  kinds, even terrapins, or freshwater turtles. The Iroquois ate and ate  until even _their_ appetites were satisfied. Then they began to cry  off; but the missionaries politely insisted, and even told them that  in failing to eat they were neglecting their religious duties. To help  them in this respect they played hymn and psalm tunes on musical  instruments. At last the Onondagas were gorged to repletion, and sank  into a stertorous slumber at sunset. Whilst they slept, the Jesuits,  their converts, and Radisson got into the already prepared canoes and  paddled quickly down the Oswego River far beyond pursuit.    Radisson next joined his brother-in-law, Medard Chouart, and after  narrowly escaping massacre by the Iroquois (once more on the warpath  along the Ottawa River) reached the northern part of Lake Huron, and  Green Bay on the north-west of Lake Michigan. From Green Bay they  travelled up the Fox River and across a portage to the Wisconsin,  which flows into the Mississippi. Down this river they sped, meeting  people of the great Siou confederation and Kri (Cree) Indians, these  last an Algonkin nation roaming in the summertime as far north as  Hudson's Bay, until at length they reached the actual waters of the  Mississippi, first of all white men. Returning then to Lake Michigan,  the shores of which seemed to them an earthly paradise with a climate  finer than Italy, they journeyed northwards into Lake Huron, and  thence north-westwards through the narrow passages of St. Mary's River  into Lake Superior. The southern coast of Lake Superior was followed  to its westernmost point, where they made a camp, and from which they  explored during the winter (in snowshoes) the Wisconsin country and  collected information regarding the Mississippi and its great western  affluent the Missouri. The Mississippi, they declared, led to Mexico,  while the other great forked river in the far west was a pathway,  perhaps, to the Southern Sea (Pacific).    The Jesuits, on the other hand, were convinced that Hudson's Bay (or  the \"Bay of the North\") was at no great distance from Lake Superior  (which was true) and that it must communicate to the north-west with  the Pacific Ocean or the sea that led to China.    In 1661, without the leave of the French Governor of Canada, who  wanted them to take two servants of his own with them and to give him  half the profits of the venture, Chouart and Radisson hurried away to  the west, picked up large bodies of natives who were returning to the  regions north of Lake Huron, with them fought their way through the  ambushed Iroquois, and once more navigated the waters of Lake  Superior. Once again they started for the Mississippi basin and  explored the country of Minnesota, coming thus into contact with  native tribes which lived on the flesh of the bison. In Minnesota they  met a second time the Kri or Kinistino Indians of north-central  Canada, and joined one of their camps in the spring of 1662, somewhere  to the west of Lake Superior. With Kri guides they started away to the  north and north-east, no doubt by way of the Lake of the Woods, the  English River, Lake St. Joseph, and the Albany River, thus reaching  the salt sea at James Bay, the southernmost extension of Hudson Bay.  Or they may have proceeded by an even shorter route, though with  longer portages for canoes, through Lake Nipigon to the Albany.    The summer of 1662 they passed on the islands and shores of James Bay  hunting \"buffalo\"[6] with the Indians. Then, in 1663, travelling back  along the same route they had followed in the previous year, they  regained Lake Superior, and so passed by the north of Lake Huron to  the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence. But on their return to Three  Rivers they were arrested by the French Governor, D'Avaugour, who  condemned them to imprisonment and severe fines. The courts of France  gave them no redress, and in their furious anger Chouart and Radisson  went over to the English, offered their services to England, and so  brought about the creation of the Hudson Bay Company.    [Footnote 6: More probably musk oxen.]    Radisson's journey from England to Hudson Bay has been treated of in  an earlier chapter: it is preferable to follow out to its finish the  great, western impulse of the French, which led them to neglect for a  time the doings of the British on the east coast of North America and  in the sub-Arctic regions of Hudson Bay.    From 1660 onwards the Jesuit missionaries again took up vigorously  that work of Christianizing the Amerindians which had been so  completely checked by the frightful ravages of the Iroquois between  1648 and 1654.    By 1669 the Jesuits had three permanent stations in western Canada.  The first was the mission station at Sault Ste. Marie, the second was  the station of Ste. Esprit, on Lake Superior (not far from the modern  town of Ashland), and the third was the station of St. Francois Xavier  at the mouth of the Fox River, on Green Bay, Lake Michigan.    As regards some of the sufferings which these missionaries had to go  through when travelling across Canada in the winter, I quote the  following from _The Relations of the Jesuits_ (p. 35):--    \"I [Father de Crepieul] set out on the 16th of January, 1674, from the  vicinity of Lake St. John, near the Saguenay River, with an Algonkin  captain and two Frenchmen. We started after Mass, and walked five long  leagues on snowshoes with much trouble, because the snow was soft and  made our snowshoes very heavy. At the end of five leagues, we found  ourselves on a lake four or five leagues long all frozen over, on  which the wind caused great quantities of snow to drift, obscuring the  air and preventing us from seeing where we are going. After walking  another league and a half with great difficulty our strength began to  fail. The wind, cold, and snow were so intolerable that they compelled  us to retrace our steps a little, to cut some branches of fir which  might in default of bark serve to build a cabin. After this we tried  to light a fire, but were unable to do so. We were thus reduced to a  most pitiful condition. The cold was beginning to seize us to an  extraordinary degree, the darkness was great, and the wind blew  fearfully. In order to keep ourselves from dying with cold, we resumed  our march on the lake in spite of our fatigue, without knowing whither  we were going, and all were greatly impeded with the wind and snow.  After walking a league and a half we had to succumb in spite of  ourselves and stop where we were. The danger we ran of dying from cold  caused me to remember the charitable Father de Noue, who in a similar  occasion was found dead in the snow, kneeling and with clasped  hands.... We therefore remained awake during the rest of the night....  On the following morning two Frenchmen arrived from Father Albanel's  cabin very opportunely, and kindled a great fire on the snow.... After  this we resumed our journey on the same lake, and at last reached the  spot where Father Albanel was.... A serious injury, caused by the fall  of a heavy load upon his loins, prevented him from moving, and still  more, from performing a missionary's duties.\"    One of the Jesuit fathers, Allouez, in founding the station of St.  Francois Xavier on Green Bay, Lake Michigan, had gained further  information about the wonderful Mississippi, which he called \"Messi  Sipi\". He also thoroughly explored Lake Nipigon, to the north of Lake  Superior. In 1669 two missionaries, named Dollier de Casson and  Galinee, started from the seminary of St. Sulpice (Montreal) to reach  the great tribes of the far west, supposed to be eager to learn of  Christianity and known to be much more tractable than the Iroquois.  These two missionaries, in their expedition of seven canoes and  twenty-one Amerindians, were accompanied by a remarkable young man  commonly known as La Salle, but whose real name was Robert  Cavalier.[7]    [Footnote 7: La Salle was the name of his property in France.]    Before leaving Lake Ontario, they actually passed the mouth of the  Niagara River and heard the falls, but had not sufficient curiosity to  leave their canoes and walk a short distance to see them. The  wonderful cascades of Niagara, where the St. Lawrence leaving Lake  Erie plunges 328 feet down into Lake Ontario (which is not much above  sea level), remained nearly undiscovered and undescribed until the  year 1678, when they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13015"],[0,"Tales of Old Japan (#18)"],[1,"his blood; and ever since that time the blades of Yoshimitsu have been  considered lucky in his family.]    A third Samurai, named Takagi Umanojo, pronounced it to be the work  of Shidzu Kanenji; and as they could not agree, but each maintained  his opinion, their lord sent for a famous connoisseur to decide the  point; and the sword proved, as Sanza had said, to be a genuine  Muramasa. Sanza was delighted at the verdict; but the other two went  home rather crestfallen. Umanojo, although he had been worsted in the  argument, bore no malice nor ill-will in his heart; but Banzayemon,  who was a vainglorious personage, puffed up with the idea of his own  importance, conceived a spite against Sanza, and watched for an  opportunity to put him to shame. At last, one day Banzayemon, eager to  be revenged upon Sanza, went to the Prince, and said, \"Your lordship  ought to see Sanza fence; his swordsmanship is beyond all praise. I  know that I am no match for him; still, if it will please your  lordship, I will try a bout with him;\" and the Prince, who was a mere  stripling, and thought it would be rare sport, immediately sent for  Sanza and desired he would fence with Banzayemon. So the two went out  into the garden, and stood up facing each other, armed with wooden  swords. Now Banzayemon was proud of his skill, and thought he had no  equal in fencing; so he expected to gain an easy victory over Sanza,  and promised himself the luxury of giving his adversary a beating that  should fully make up for the mortification which he had felt in the  matter of the dispute about the sword. It happened, however, that he  had undervalued the skill of Sanza, who, when he saw that his  adversary was attacking him savagely and in good earnest, by a rapid  blow struck Banzayemon so sharply on the wrist that he dropped the  sword, and, before he could pick it up again, delivered a second cut  on the shoulder, which sent him rolling over in the dust. All the  officers present, seeing this, praised Sanza's skill, and Banzayemon,  utterly stricken with shame, ran away home and hid himself.    After this affair Sanza rose high in the favour of his lord; and  Banzayemon, who was more than ever jealous of him, feigned sickness,  and stayed at home devising schemes for Sanza's ruin.    Now it happened that the Prince, wishing to have the Muramasa blade  mounted, sent for Sanza and entrusted it to his care, ordering him to  employ the most cunning workmen in the manufacture of the  scabbard-hilt and ornaments; and Sanza, having received the blade,  took it home, and put it carefully away. When Banzayemon heard of  this, he was overjoyed; for he saw that his opportunity for revenge  had come. He determined, if possible, to kill Sanza, but at any rate  to steal the sword which had been committed to his care by the Prince,  knowing full well that if Sanza lost the sword he and his family would  be ruined. Being a single man, without wife or child, he sold his  furniture, and, turning all his available property into money, made  ready to fly the country. When his preparations were concluded, he  went in the middle of the night to Sanza's house and tried to get in  by stealth; but the doors and shutters were all carefully bolted from  the inside, and there was no hole by which he could effect an  entrance. All was still, however, and the people of the house were  evidently fast asleep; so he climbed up to the second storey, and,  having contrived to unfasten a window, made his way in. With soft,  cat-like footsteps he crept downstairs, and, looking into one of the  rooms, saw Sanza and his wife sleeping on the mats, with their little  son Kosanza, a boy of thirteen, curled up in his quilt between them.  The light in the night-lamp was at its last flicker, but, peering  through the gloom, he could just see the Prince's famous Muramasa  sword lying on a sword-rack in the raised part of the room: so he  crawled stealthily along until he could reach it, and stuck it in his  girdle. Then, drawing near to Sanza, he bestrode his sleeping body,  and, brandishing the sword made a thrust at his throat; but in his  excitement his hand shook, so that he missed his aim, and only  scratched Sanza, who, waking with a start and trying to jump up, felt  himself held down by a man standing over him. Stretching out his  hands, he would have wrestled with his enemy; when Banzayemon, leaping  back, kicked over the night-lamp, and throwing open the shutters,  dashed into the garden. Snatching up his sword, Sanza rushed out after  him; and his wife, having lit a lantern and armed herself with a  halberd,[28] went out, with her son Kosanza, who carried a drawn dirk,  to help her husband. Then Banzayemon, who was hiding in the shadow of  a large pine-tree, seeing the lantern and dreading detection, seized a  stone and hurled it at the light, and, chancing to strike it, put it  out, and then scrambling over the fence unseen, fled into the  darkness. When Sanza had searched all over the garden in vain, he  returned to his room and examined his wound, which proving very  slight, he began to look about to see whether the thief had carried  off anything; but when his eye fell upon the place where the Muramasa  sword had lain, he saw that it was gone. He hunted everywhere, but it  was not to be found. The precious blade with which his Prince had  entrusted him had been stolen, and the blame would fall heavily upon  him. Filled with grief and shame at the loss, Sanza and his wife and  child remained in great anxiety until the morning broke, when he  reported the matter to one of the Prince's councillors, and waited in  seclusion until he should receive his lord's commands.    [Footnote 28: The halberd is the special arm of the Japanese woman of  gentle blood. That which was used by Kasa Gozen, one of the ladies of  Yoshitsune, the hero of the twelfth century, is still preserved at  Asakusa. In old-fashioned families young ladies are regularly  instructed in fencing with the halberds.]    It soon became known that Banzayemon, who had fled the province, was  the thief; and the councillors made their report accordingly to the  Prince, who, although he expressed his detestation of the mean action  of Banzayemon, could not absolve Sanza from blame, in that he had not  taken better precautions to insure the safety of the sword that had  been committed to his trust. It was decided, therefore, that Sanza  should be dismissed from his service, and that his goods should be  confiscated; with the proviso that should he be able to find  Banzayemon, and recover the lost Muramasa blade, he should be restored  to his former position. Sanza, who from the first had made up his mind  that his punishment would be severe, accepted the decree without a  murmur; and, having committed his wife and son to the care of his  relations, prepared to leave the country as a Ronin and search for  Banzayemon.    Before starting, however, he thought that he would go to his  brother-officer, Takagi Umanojo, and consult with him as to what  course he should pursue to gain his end. But this Umanojo, who was by  nature a churlish fellow, answered him unkindly, and said--    \"It is true that Banzayemon is a mean thief; but still it was through  your carelessness that the sword was lost. It is of no avail your  coming to me for help: you must get it back as best you may.\"    \"Ah!\" replied Sanza, \"I see that you too bear me a grudge because I  defeated you in the matter of the judgment of the sword. You are no  better than Banzayemon yourself.\"    And his heart was bitter against his fellow men, and he left the house  determined to kill Umanojo first and afterwards to track out  Banzayemon; so, pretending to start on his journey, he hid in an inn,  and waited for an opportunity to attack Umanojo.    One day Umanojo, who was very fond of fishing, had taken his son  Umanosuke, a lad of sixteen, down to the sea-shore with him; and as  the two were enjoying themselves, all of a sudden they perceived a  Samurai running towards them, and when he drew near they saw that it  was Sanza. Umanojo, thinking that Sanza had come back in order to talk  over some important matter, left his angling and went to meet him.  Then Sanza cried out--    \"Now, Sir Umanojo, draw and defend yourself. What! were you in league  with Banzayemon to vent your spite upon me? Draw, sir, draw! You have  spirited away your accomplice; but, at any rate, you are here  yourself, and shall answer for your deed. It is no use playing the  innocent; your astonished face shall not save you. Defend yourself,  coward and traitor!\" and with these words Sanza flourished his naked  sword.    \"Nay, Sir Sanza,\" replied the other, anxious by a soft answer to turn  away his wrath; \"I am innocent of this deed. Waste not your valour on  so poor a cause.\"    \"Lying knave!\" said Sanza; \"think not that you can impose upon me. I  know your treacherous heart;\" and, rushing upon Umanojo, he cut him on  the forehead so that he fell in agony upon the sand.    Umanosuke in the meanwhile, who had been fishing at some distance from  his father, rushed up when he saw him in this perilous situation and  threw a stone at Sanza, hoping to distract his attention; but, before  he could reach the spot, Sanza had delivered the death-blow, and  Umanojo lay a corpse upon the beach.    \"Stop, Sir Sanza--murderer of my father!\" cried Umanosuke, drawing  his sword, \"stop and do battle with me, that I may avenge his death.\"    \"That you should wish to slay your father's enemy,\" replied Sanza, \"is  but right and proper; and although I had just cause of quarrel with  your father, and killed him, as a Samurai should, yet would I gladly  forfeit my life to you here; but my life is precious to me for one  purpose--that I may punish Banzayemon and get back the stolen sword.  When I shall have restored that sword to my lord, then will I give you  your revenge, and you may kill me. A soldier's word "]]]
