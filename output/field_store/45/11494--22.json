Yes, indeed, I said; that is very melancholy.    Let us then, in the first place, he said, be careful of allowing or of  admitting into our souls the notion that there is no health or soundness  in any arguments at all. Rather say that we have not yet attained to  soundness in ourselves, and that we must struggle manfully and do our  best to gain health of mind--you and all other men having regard to the  whole of your future life, and I myself in the prospect of death. For at  this moment I am sensible that I have not the temper of a philosopher;  like the vulgar, I am only a partisan. Now the partisan, when he is  engaged in a dispute, cares nothing about the rights of the question,  but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own assertions.  And the difference between him and me at the present moment is merely  this--that whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that what he says is  true, I am rather seeking to convince myself; to convince my hearers  is a secondary matter with me. And do but see how much I gain by the  argument. For if what I say is true, then I do well to be persuaded of  the truth, but if there be nothing after death, still, during the short  time that remains, I shall not distress my friends with lamentations,  and my ignorance will not last, but will die with me, and therefore  no harm will be done. This is the state of mind, Simmias and Cebes, in  which I approach the argument. And I would ask you to be thinking of  the truth and not of Socrates: agree with me, if I seem to you to be  speaking the truth; or if not, withstand me might and main, that I may  not deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm, and like the bee,  leave my sting in you before I die.    And now let us proceed, he said. And first of all let me be sure that  I have in my mind what you were saying. Simmias, if I remember rightly,  has fears and misgivings whether the soul, although a fairer and diviner  thing than the body, being as she is in the form of harmony, may not  perish first. On the other hand, Cebes appeared to grant that the soul  was more lasting than the body, but he said that no one could know  whether the soul, after having worn out many bodies, might not perish  herself and leave her last body behind her; and that this is death,  which is the destruction not of the body but of the soul, for in the  body the work of destruction is ever going on. Are not these, Simmias  and Cebes, the points which we have to consider?    They both agreed to this statement of them.    He proceeded: And did you deny the force of the whole preceding  argument, or of a part only?    Of a part only, they replied.    And what did you think, he said, of that part of the argument in which  we said that knowledge was recollection, and hence inferred that the  soul must have previously existed somewhere else before she was enclosed  in the body?    Cebes said that he had been wonderfully impressed by that part of the  argument, and that his conviction remained absolutely unshaken. Simmias  agreed, and added that he himself could hardly imagine the possibility  of his ever thinking differently.    But, rejoined Socrates, you will have to think differently, my Theban  friend, if you still maintain that harmony is a compound, and that the  soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the frame of the  body; for you will surely never allow yourself to say that a harmony is  prior to the elements which compose it.    Never, Socrates.    But do you not see that this is what you imply when you say that the  soul existed before she took the form and body of man, and was made up  of elements which as yet had no existence? For harmony is not like  the soul, as you suppose; but first the lyre, and the strings, and the  sounds exist in a state of discord, and then harmony is made last of  all, and perishes first. And how can such a notion of the soul as this  agree with the other?    Not at all, replied Simmias.    And yet, he said, there surely ought to be harmony in a discourse of  which harmony is the theme.    There ought, replied Simmias.    But there is no harmony, he said, in the two propositions that knowledge  is recollection, and that the soul is a harmony. Which of them will you  retain?    I think, he replied, that I have a much stronger faith, Socrates, in the  first of the two, which has been fully demonstrated to me, than in  the latter, which has not been demonstrated at all, but rests only on  probable and plausible grounds; and is therefore believed by the many. I  know too well that these arguments from probabilities are impostors, and  unless great caution is observed in the use of them, they are apt to  be deceptive--in geometry, and in other things too. But the doctrine of  knowledge and recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy grounds;  and the proof was that the soul must have existed before she came into  the body, because to her belongs the essence of which the very name  implies existence. Having, as I am convinced, rightly accepted this  conclusion, and on sufficient grounds, I must, as I suppose, cease to  argue or allow others to argue that the soul is a harmony.    Let me put the matter, Simmias, he said, in another point of view: Do  you imagine that a harmony or any other composition can be in a state  other than that of the elements, out of which it is compounded?    Certainly not.    Or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer?    He agreed.    Then a harmony does not, properly speaking, lead the parts or elements  which make up the harmony, but only follows them.    He assented.    For harmony cannot possibly have any motion, or sound, or other quality  which is opposed to its parts.    That would be impossible, he replied.    And does not the nature of every harmony depend upon the manner in which  the elements are harmonized?    I do not understand you, he said.    I mean to say that a harmony admits of degrees, and is more of a  harmony, and more completely a harmony, when more truly and fully  harmonized, to any extent which is possible; and less of a harmony, and  less completely a harmony, when less truly and fully harmonized.    True.    But does the soul admit of degrees? or is one soul in the very least  degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?    Not in the least.    Yet surely of two souls, one is said to have intelligence and virtue,  and to be good, and the other to have folly and vice, and to be an evil  soul: and this is said truly?    Yes, truly.    But what will those who maintain the soul to be a harmony say of this  presence of virtue and vice in the soul?--will they say that here is  another harmony, and another discord, and that the virtuous soul is  harmonized, and herself being a harmony has another harmony within her,  and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has no harmony within her?    I cannot tell, replied Simmias; but I suppose that something of the sort  would be asserted by those who say that the soul is a harmony.    And we have already admitted that no soul is more a soul than another;  which is equivalent to admitting that harmony is not more or less  harmony, or more or less completely a harmony?    Quite true.    And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less  harmonized?    True.    And that which is not more or less harmonized cannot have more or less  of harmony, but only an equal harmony?    Yes, an equal harmony.    Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another, is  not more or less harmonized?    Exactly.    And therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?    She has not.    And having neither more nor less of harmony or of discord, one soul  has no more vice or virtue than another, if vice be discord and virtue  harmony?    Not at all more.    Or speaking more correctly, Simmias, the soul, if she is a harmony, will  never have any vice; because a harmony, being absolutely a harmony, has  no part in the inharmonical.    No.    And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice?    How can she have, if the previous argument holds?    Then, if all souls are equally by their nature souls, all souls of all  living creatures will be equally good?    I agree with you, Socrates, he said.    And can all this be true, think you? he said; for these are the  consequences which seem to follow from the assumption that the soul is a  harmony?    It cannot be true.    Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature  other than the soul, and especially the wise soul? Do you know of any?    Indeed, I do not.    And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body? or is she  at variance with them? For example, when the body is hot and thirsty,  does not the soul incline us against drinking? and when the body  is hungry, against eating? And this is only one instance out of ten  thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the body.    Very true.    But we have already acknowledged that the soul, being a harmony, can  never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and  vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is  composed; she can only follow, she cannot lead them?    It must be so, he replied.    And yet do we not now discover the soul to be doing the exact  opposite--leading the elements of which she is believed to be composed;  almost always opposing and coercing them in all sorts of ways throughout  life, sometimes more violently with the pains of medicine and gymnastic;  then again more gently; now threatening, now admonishing the desires,  passions, fears, as if talking to a thing which is not herself, as Homer  in the Odyssee represents Odysseus doing in the words--    'He beat his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16598"],[0,"History of the American Negro in the Great World War (#18)"],[1,"you hesitate, why do you not kill them, why not crush them at       once?'         \"The mulatto lifted his arms against Captain Preston, and having       turned one of the muskets, he seized the bayonet with his left       hand, as if he intended to execute his threat At this moment,       confused cries were heard: 'The wretches dare not fire!' Firing       succeeds. Attucks is slain. Other discharges follow. Three were       killed, five severely wounded and several others slightly.\"    Attucks was killed by Montgomery, one of Captain Preston's soldiers. He  had been foremost in resisting and was first slain. As proof of a front  engagement, he received two balls, one in each breast. The white men  killed with Attucks were Samuel Maverick, Samuel Gray and Jonas  Caldwell.    John Adams, afterwards President of the United States, was counsel for  the soldiers in the investigation which followed. He admitted that  Attucks appeared to have been the hero of the occasion and the leader of  the people. Attucks and Caldwell, not being residents of Boston, were  buried from Faneuil Hall, the cradle of liberty. The citizens generally  participated in the solemnities.    If the outrages against the American colonists had not been so flagrant,  and so well imbedded as indisputable records of our history; if the  action of the military authorities had not been so arbitrary, the  uprising of Attucks and his followers might be looked upon as a common,  reprehensible riot and the participants as a band of misguided  incendiaries. Subsequent reverence for the occasion, disproves any such  view. Judge Dawes, a prominent jurist of the time, as well as a  brilliant exponent of the people, alluding in 1775 to the event, said:         \"The provocation of that night must be numbered among the       master-springs which gave the first motion to a vast machinery--a       noble and comprehensive system of national independence.\"    Ramsey's History of the American Revolution, says:         \"The anniversary of the 5th of March was observed with great       solemnity; eloquent orators were successively employed to preserve       the remembrance of it fresh in the mind. On these occasions the       blessings of liberty, the horrors of slavery, and the danger of a       standing army, were presented to the public view. These annual       orations administered fuel to the fire of liberty and kept it       burning with an irresistible flame.\"    The 5th of March continued to be celebrated for the above reasons until  the anniversary of the Declaration of American Independence was  substituted in its place; and its orators were expected to honor the  feelings and principles of the former as having given birth to the  latter. On the 5th of March 1776, Washington repaired to the  intrenchments. \"Remember\" said he, \"It is the 5th of March, and avenge  the death of your brethren.\"    In the introduction to a book entitled \"The Colored Patriots of the  American Revolution\" by William C. Nell, a Negro historian, Harriet  Beecher Stowe said in 1855:         \"The colored race have been generally considered by their enemies,       and sometimes even by their friends, as deficient in energy and       courage. Their virtues have been supposed to be principally       negative ones.\" Speaking of the incidents in Mr. Nell's collection       she says: \"They will redeem the character of the race from this       misconception and show how much injustice there may often be in a       generally accepted idea\". Continuing, she says:         \"In considering the services of the colored patriots of the       Revolution, we are to reflect upon them as far more magnanimous,       because rendered to a nation which did not acknowledge them as       citizens and equals, and in whose interests and prosperity they had       less at stake. It was not for their own land they fought, not even       for a land which had adopted them, but for a land which had       enslaved them, and whose laws, even in freedom, oftener oppressed       than protected. Bravery, under such circumstances, has a peculiar       beauty and merit.         \"And their white brothers--may remember that generosity,       disinterested courage and bravery, are of no particular race and       complexion, and that the image of the Heavenly Father may be       reflected alike by all. Each record of worth in this oppressed and       despised people should be pondered, for it is by many such that the       cruel and unjust public sentiment, which has so long proscribed       them, may be reversed, and full opportunities given them to take       rank among the nations of the earth.\"    Estimates from competent sources state that not less than 3,000 Negro  soldiers did service in the American army during the Revolution. Rhode  Island first made her slaves free men and then called on them to fight.  A black regiment was raised there, of which Colonel Christopher Green  was made commander. Connecticut furnished a black battalion under  command of Colonel David Humphrey.    Prior to the Revolution, two Virginia Negroes, Israel Titus and Samuel  Jenkins, had fought under Braddock and Washington in the French and  Indian war.    It has been said that one of the men killed when Major Pitcairn  commanding the British advance on Concord and Lexington, April 19, 1775,  ordered his troops to fire on the Americans, was a Negro bearing arms.  Peter Salem a Negro did service during the Revolution, and is said to  have killed this same Major Pitcairn, at the battle of Bunker Hill. In  some old engravings of the battle, Salem is pictured as occupying a  prominent position. These pictures were carried on some of the currency  of the Monumental bank of Charlestown, Massachusetts and the Freeman's  bank of Boston. Other black men fought at Bunker Hill, of whom we have  the names of Salem Poor, Titus Coburn, Alexander Ames, Barzillai Lew and  Gato Howe. After the war these men were pensioned.    Prince, a Negro soldier, was Colonel Barton's chief assistant in  capturing the British officer, Major General Prescott at Newport, R.I.  Primus Babcock received an honorable discharge from the army signed by  General Washington. Lambo Latham and Jordan Freeman fell with Ledyard at  the storming of Fort Griswold. Freeman is said to have killed Major  Montgomery, a British officer who was leading an attack on Americans in  a previous fight. History does not record whether or not this was the  same or a related Montgomery to the one who killed Crispus Attucks at  Boston.    Hamet, one of General Washington's Negroes, was drawing a pension as a  revolutionary soldier as late as 1839, Oliver Cromwell served six years  and nine months in Col. Israel Shreve's regiment of New Jersey troops  under Washington's immediate command. Charles Bowles became an American  soldier at the age of sixteen years and served to the end of the  Revolution. Seymour Burr and Jeremy Jonah were Negro soldiers in a  Connecticut regiment.    A Negro whose name is not known obtained the countersign by which Mad  Anthony Wayne was enabled to take Stony Point, and guided and helped him  to do so.    Jack Grove was a Negro steward on board an American vessel which the  British captured. He figured out that the vessel could be retaken if  sufficient courage were shown. He insisted and at length prevailed upon  his captain to make the attempt, which was successful.    There was in Massachusetts during those Revolutionary days one company  of Negro men bearing a special designation, \"The Bucks.\" It was a  notable body of men. At the close of the war its fame and services were  recognized by John Hancock presenting to it a beautiful banner.    The European struggle recently ended furnished a remarkable example of  female heroism and devotion to country in the case of the Russian woman  who enlisted as a common soldier in the army of the Czar, served with  distinction and finally organized an effective unit of female soldiers  known as the \"Battalion of Death.\" More resourceful and no less  remarkable and heroic, is the case of Deborah Gannet, a Negro woman  soldier of the Revolution, which may be summed up in the following  resolution passed by the General Court of Massachusetts during the  session of 1791:--         \"XXIII--Whereas, it appears to this court that the said Deborah       Gannett enlisted, under the name of Robert Shurtliff, in Capt       Webb's company, in the Fourth Massachusetts regiment, on May 20,       1782, and did actually perform the duties of a soldier, in the late       army of the United States to the 23rd day of October, 1783, for       which she has received no compensation; and, whereas, it further       appears that the said Deborah exhibited an extraordinary instance       of female heroism by discharging the duties of a faithful, gallant       soldier, and at the same time preserving the virtue and chastity of       her sex unsuspected and unblemished, and was discharged from the       service with a fair and honorable character, therefore,         \"Resolved, that the Treasurer of this Commonwealth be, and he       hereby is, directed to issue his note to the said Deborah for the       sum of thirty-four pounds, bearing interest from October 23, 1783.\"    There is not lacking evidence that Negroes distinguished themselves in  the struggles of the pioneer settlers against the Indians. This was  particularly true of the early history of Kentucky. The following  incidents are recorded in Thompson's \"Young People's History of  Kentucky:\"         \"Ben Stockton was a slave in the family of Major George Stockton of       Fleming county. He was a regular Negro, and though a slave, was       devoted to his master. He hated an Indian and loved to moralize       over a dead one; getting into a towering rage and swearing       magnificently when a horse was stolen; handled his rifle well,       though somewhat foppishly, and hopped, danced and "]]]
