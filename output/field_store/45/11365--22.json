When she made bread, she thought of the bread, and not of the  fashion of her next dress, or of her partner at the last dance.\" _Lord  Chesterfield said,_ \"There is time enough for everything in the course of  the day, if you do but one thing at a time; but there is not time enough  in the year if you try to do two things at a time.\"    To attain the best results one should practice concentrating upon the  task before him, shutting out, so far as possible, every other idea or  thought. One should even forget self--personality--in such cases, as  there is nothing more destructive of good thinking than to allow morbid  self-consciousness to intrude. One does best when he \"forgets himself\" in  his work, and sinks his personality in the creative work. The \"earnest\"  man or woman is the one who sinks personality in the desired result, or  performance of the task undertaken. The actor, or preacher, or orator,  or writer, must lose sight of himself to get the best results. Keep the  Attention fixed on the thing before you, and let the self take care of  itself.    In connection with the above, we may relate an anecdote of _Whateley_  that may be interesting in connection with the consideration of this  subject of \"losing one's self\" in the task. He was asked for a recipe for  \"bashfulness,\" and replied that the person was bashful simply because he  was thinking of himself and the impression he was making. His recipe was  that the young man should think of others--of the pleasure he could give  them--and in that way he would forget all about himself. The prescription  is said to have effected the cure. The same authority has written, \"Let  both the extemporary speaker, and the reader of his own compositions,  study to avoid as far as possible all thoughts of self, earnestly fixing  the mind on the matter of what is delivered; and they will feel less  that embarrassment which arises from the thought of what opinion the  hearers will form of them.\"    The same writer, _Whateley_, seems to have made quite a study of  Attention and has given us some interesting information on its details.  The following may be read with interest, and if properly understood may  be employed to advantage. He says, \"It is a fact, and a very curious one.  that many people find that they can best attend to any serious matter  when they are occupied with something else which requires a little, and  but a little, attention, such as working with the needle, cutting open  paper leaves, or, for want of some such employment, fiddling anyhow with  the fingers.\" He does not give the reason for this, and at first sight  it might seem like a contradiction of the \"one thing at a time\" idea. But  a closer examination will show us that the minor work (the cutting  leaves, etc.) is in the nature of an involuntary or automatic movement,  inasmuch as it requires little or no voluntary attention, and seems to  \"do itself.\" It does not take off the Attention from the main subject,  but perhaps acts to catch the \"waste Attention\" that often tries to  divide the Attention from some voluntary act to another. The habit mind  may be doing one thing, while the Attention is fixed on another. For  instance, one may be writing with his attention firmly fixed upon the  thought he wishes to express, while at the time his hand is doing the  writing, apparently with no attention being given it. But, let a boy, or  person unaccustomed to writing, try to express his thoughts in this way,  and you will find that he is hampered in the flow of his thoughts by the  fact that he has to give much attention to the mechanical act of writing.  In the same way, the beginner on the typewriter finds it difficult to  compose to the machine, while the experienced typist finds the mechanical  movements no hindrance whatever to the flow of thought and focusing of  Attention; in fact, many find that they can compose much better while  using the typewriter than they can by dictating to a stenographer. We  think you will see the principle.    And now for a little Mental Drill in Attention, that you may be started  on the road to cultivate this important faculty.      MENTAL DRILL IN ATTENTION.    _Exercise I._ Begin by taking some familiar object and placing it before  you, try to get as many impressions regarding it as is possible for you.  Study its shape, its color, its size, and the thousand and one little  peculiarities about it that present themselves to your attention. In  doing this, reduce the thing to its simplest parts--analyze it as far as  is possible--dissect it, mentally, and study its parts in detail. The  more simple and small the part to be considered, the more clearly will  the impression be received, and the more vividly will it be recalled.  Reduce the thing to the smallest possible proportions, and then examine  each portion, and mastering that, then pass on to the next part, and so  on, until you have covered the entire field. Then, when you have  exhausted the object, take a pencil and paper and put down as nearly as  possible all the things or details of the object examined. When you have  done this, compare the written description with the object itself, and  see how many things you have failed to note.    The next day take up the same object, and after re-examining it, write  down the details and you will find that you will have stored away a  greater number of impressions regarding it, and, moreover, you will have  discovered many new details during your second examination. This exercise  strengthens the memory as well as the Attention, for the two are closely  connected, the memory depending largely upon the clearness and strength  of the impressions received, while the impressions depend upon the amount  of attention given to the thing observed. Do not tire yourself with this  exercise, for a tired Attention is a poor Attention. Better try it by  degrees, increasing the task a little each time you try it. Make a game  of it if you like, and you will find it quite interesting to notice the  steady but gradual improvement.    It will be interesting to practice this in connection with some friend,  varying the exercise by both examining the object, and writing down their  impressions, separately, and then comparing results. This adds interest  to the task, and you will be surprised to see how rapidly both of you  increase in your powers of observation, which powers, of course, result  from Attention.    _Exercise II._ This exercise is but a variation of the first one. It  consists in entering a room, and taking a hasty glance around, and then  walking out, and afterward writing down the number of things that you  have observed, with a description of each. You will be surprised to  observe how many things you have missed at first sight, and how you will  improve in observation by a little practice. This exercise, also, may be  improved by the assistance of a friend, as related in our last exercise.  It is astonishing how many details one may observe and remember, after a  little practice. It is related of Houdin, the French conjurer, that he  improved and developed his faculty of Attention and Memory by playing  this game with a young relative. They would pass by a shop window,  taking a hasty, attentive glance at its contents. Then they would go  around the corner and compare notes. At first they could remember only a  few prominent articles--that is, their Attention could grasp only a few.  But as they developed by practice, they found that they could observe and  remember a vast number of things and objects in the window. And, at last,  it is related that Houdin could pass rapidly before any large shop  window, bestowing upon it but one hasty glance, and then tell the names  of, and closely describe, nearly every object in plain sight in the  window. The feat was accomplished by the fact that the cultivated  Attention enabled Houdin to fasten upon his mind a vivid mental image of  the window and its contents, and then he was able to describe the  articles one by one from the picture in his mind.    Houdin taught his son to develop Attention by a simple exercise which may  be interesting and of value to you. He would lay down a domino before the  boy--a five-four, for example. He would require the boy to tell him the  combined number at once, without allowing him to stop to count the spots,  one by one. \"Nine\" the boy would answer after a moment's hesitation.  Then another domino, a three-four, would be added. \"That makes sixteen,\"  cried the boy. Two dominoes at a time was the second day's task. The  next day, three was the standard. The next day, four, and so on, until  the boy was able to handle twelve dominoes--that is to say, give  instantaneously the total number of spots on twelve dominoes, after a  single glance. This was Attention, in earnest, and shows what practice  will do to develop a faculty. The result was shown by the wonderful  powers of observation, memory and attention, together with instantaneous  mental action, that the boy developed. Not only was he able to add  dominoes instantaneously, but he had powers of observation, etc., that  seemed little short of miraculous. And yet it is related that he had poor  attention, and deficient memory to begin with.    If this seems incredible, let us remember how old whist players note and  remember every card in the pack, and can tell whether they have been  played or not, and all the circumstances attending upon them. The same is  true of chess players, who observe every move and can relate the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1366"],[0,"The Cloister and the Hearth (#18)"],[1,"us  to a safer place than this.\"    \"Will you come home with me, Gerard?\" said little Kate.    \"I have no home.\"    \"You shall not say so. Who is more welcome than you will be, after this  cruel wrong, to your father's house?    \"Father! I have no father,\" said Gerard sternly. \"He that was my father  is turned my gaoler. I have escaped from his hands; I will never come  within their reach again.\"    \"An enemy did this, and not our father.\"    And she told him what she had overheard Cornelis and Sybrandt say. But  the injury was too recent to be soothed. Gerard showed a bitterness of  indignation he had hitherto seemed incapable of.    \"Cornelis and Sybrandt are two ill curs that have shown me their teeth  and their heart a long while; but they could do no more. My father it is  that gave the burgomaster authority, or he durst not have laid a finger  on me, that am a free burgher of this town. So be it, then. I was his  son. I am his prisoner. He has played his part. I shall play mine.  Farewell the burgh where I was born, and lived honestly and was put in  prison. While there is another town left in creation, I'll never trouble  you again, Tergou.\"    \"Oh! Gerard! Gerard!\"    Margaret whispered her: \"Do not gainsay him now. Give his choler time to  cool!\"    Kate turned quickly towards her. \"Let me look at your face?\" The  inspection was favourable, it seemed, for she whispered: \"It is a comely  face, and no mischief-maker's.\"    \"Fear me not,\" said Margaret, in the same tone. \"I could not be happy  without your love, as well as Gerard's.\"    \"These are comfortable words,\" sobbed Kate. Then, looking up, she said,  \"I little thought to like you so well. My heart is willing, but my  infirmity will not let me embrace you.\"    At this hint, Margaret wound gently round Gerard's sister, and kissed  her lovingly.    \"Often he has spoken of you to me, Kate; and often I longed for this.\"    \"You, too, Gerard,\" said Kate; \"kiss me ere you go; for my heart lies  heavy at parting with you this night.\"    Gerard kissed her, and she went on her crutches home. The last thing  they heard of her was a little patient sigh. Then the tears came and  stood thick in Margaret's eyes. But Gerard was a man, and noticed not  his sister's sigh.    As they turned to go to Sevenbergen, the dwarf nudged Gerard with his  bundle of parchments and held out a concave claw.    Margaret dissuaded Gerard. \"Why take what is not ours?\"    \"Oh, spoil an enemy how you can.\"    \"But may they not make this a handle for fresh violence?\"    \"How can they? Think you I shall stay in Tergou after this? The  burgomaster robbed me of my liberty; I doubt I should take his life for  it, if I could.\"    \"Oh, fie! Gerard.\"    \"What! Is life worth more than liberty? Well, I can't take his life, so  I take the first thing that comes to hand.\"    He gave Giles a few small coins, with which the urchin was gladdened,  and shuffled after his sister. Margaret and Gerard were speedily joined  by Martin, and away to Sevenbergen.        CHAPTER XII    Ghysbrecht Van Swieten kept the key of Gerard's prison in his pouch. He  waited till ten of the clock ere he visited for he said to himself, \"A  little hunger sometimes does well it breaks 'em.\" At ten he crept up  the stairs with a loaf and pitcher, followed by his trusty servant well  armed. Ghysbrecht listened at the door. There was no sound inside.  A grim smile stole over his features. \"By this time he will be as  down-hearted as Albert Koestein was,\" thought he. He opened the door.    No Gerard.    Ghysbrecht stood stupefied.    Although his face was not visible, his body seemed to lose all motion  in so peculiar a way, and then after a little he fell trembling so, that  the servant behind him saw there was something amiss, and crept close  to him and peeped over his shoulder. At sight of the empty cell, and  the rope, and iron bar, he uttered a loud exclamation of wonder; but his  surprise doubled when his master, disregarding all else, suddenly flung  himself on his knees before the empty chest, and felt wildly all over it  with quivering hands, as if unwilling to trust his eyes in a matter so  important.    The servant gazed at him in utter bewilderment.    \"Why, master, what is the matter?\"    Ghysbrecht's pale lips worked as if he was going to answer; but they  uttered no sound: his hands fell by his side, and he stared into the  chest.    \"Why, master, what avails glaring into that empty box? The lad is not  there. See here! note the cunning of the young rogue; he hath taken out  the bar, and--\"    \"GONE! GONE! GONE!\"    \"Gone! What is gone, Holy saints! he is planet-struck!\"    \"STOP THIEF!\" shrieked Ghysbrecht, and suddenly turned, on his servant  and collared him, and shook him with rage. \"D'ye stand there, knave, and  see your master robbed? Run! fly! A hundred crowns to him that finds  it me again. No, no! 'tis in vain. Oh, fool! fool! to leave that in the  same room with him. But none ever found the secret spring before. None  ever would but he. It was to be. It is to be. Lost! lost!\" and his years  and infirmity now gained the better of his short-lived frenzy, and he  sank on the chest muttering \"Lost! lost!\"    \"What is lost, master?\" asked the servant kindly.    \"House and lands and good name,\" groaned Ghysbrecht, and wrung his hands  feebly.    \"WHAT?\" cried the servant.    This emphatic word, and the tone of eager curiosity, struck on  Ghysbrecht's ear and revived his natural cunning.    \"I have lost the town records,\" stammered he, and he looked askant at  the man like a fox caught near a hen-roost.    \"Oh, is that all?\"    \"Is't not enough? What will the burghers say to me? What will the burghs  do?\" Then he suddenly burst out again, \"A hundred crowns to him who  shall recover them; all, mind, all that were in this box. If one be  missing, I give nothing.\"    \"'Tis a bargain, master: the hundred crowns are in my pouch. See you not  that where Gerard Eliassoen is, there are the pieces of sheepskin you  rate so high?\"    \"That is true; that is true, good Dierich: good faithful Dierich. All,  mind, all that were in the chest.\"    \"Master, I will take the constables to Gerard's house, and seize him for  the theft.\"    \"The theft? ay! good; very good. It is theft. I forgot that. So, as he  is a thief now, we will put him in the dungeons below, where the toads  are and the rats. Dierich, that man must never see daylight again. 'Tis  his own fault; he must be prying. Quick, quick! ere he has time to talk,  you know, time to talk.\"    In less than half an hour Dierich Brower and four constables entered  the hosier's house, and demanded young Gerard of the panic-stricken  Catherine.    \"Alas! what has he done now?\" cried she; \"that boy will break my heart.\"    \"Nay, dame, but a trick of youth,\" said Dierich. \"He hath but made  off with certain skins of parchment, in a frolic doubtless but the  burgomaster is answerable to the burgh for their safe keeping, so he is  in care about them; as for the youth, he will doubtless be quit for a  reprimand.\"    This smooth speech completely imposed on Catherine; but her daughter  was more suspicious, and that suspicion was strengthened by the  disproportionate anger and disappointment Dierich showed the moment he  learned Gerard was not at home, had not been at home that night.    \"Come away then,\" said he roughly. \"We are wasting time.\" He added  vehemently, \"I'll find him if he is above ground.\"    Affection sharpens the wits, and often it has made an innocent person  more than a match for the wily. As Dierich was going out, Kate made him  a signal she would speak with him privately. He bade his men go on, and  waited outside the door. She joined him.    \"Hush!\" said she; \"my mother knows not. Gerard has left Tergou.\"    \"How?\"    \"I saw him last night.\"    \"Ay! Where?\" cried Dierich eagerly.    \"At the foot of the haunted tower.\"    \"How did he get the rope?\"    \"I know not; but this I know; my brother Gerard bade me there farewell,  and he is many leagues from Tergou ere this. The town, you know, was  always unworthy of him, and when it imprisoned him, he vowed never  to set foot in it again. Let the burgomaster be content, then. He has  imprisoned him, and he has driven him from his birthplace and from his  native land. What need now to rob him and us of our good name?\"    This might at another moment have struck Dierich as good sense; but he  was too mortified at this escape of Gerard and the loss of a hundred  crowns.    \"What need had he to steal?\" retorted he bitterly.    \"Gerard stole not the trash; he but took it to spite the burgomaster,  who stole his liberty; but he shall answer to the Duke for it, he shall.  As for these skins of parchment you keep such a coil about, look in the  nearest brook or stye, and 'tis odds but you find them.\"    \"Think ye so, mistress?--think ye so?\" And Dierich's eyes flashed.  \"Mayhap you know 'tis so.\"    \"This I know, that Gerard is too good to steal, and too wise to load  himself with rubbish, going a journey.\"    \"Give you good day, then,\" said Dierich sharply. \"The sheepskin you  scorn, I value it more than the skin of any in Tergou.\"    And he went off hastily on a false scent.    Kate returned into the house and drew Giles aside.    \"Giles, my heart misgives me; breathe not to a soul what I say to you. I  have told Dirk Brower that Gerard is out of Holland, but much I doubt he  is not a league from Tergou.\"    \"Why, where is he, then?\"    \"Where should he be, but with her he loves? But if so, he must not  loiter. These be deep and dark and wicked men that seek him. Giles, I  see that in Dirk Brower's eye makes me tremble. Oh, why cannot I fly to  Sevenbergen and bid him away? Why am I not lusty and active like other  girls? God forgive me for fretting at His will; but I never felt till  now what it is to be lame and weak and useless. But you are strong, dear  Giles,\" added she coaxingly; \"you are very strong.\"    \""]]]
