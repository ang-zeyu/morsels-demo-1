The  elements or entities that have merely a potential existence in this sign  become distinct separate entities in the next three signs.  Their union  into a single entity leads to the destruction of the phenomenal  universe, and the recognition of the pure Spirit and their separation  has the contrary effect.  It leads to material earth-bound existence and  brings into view the picture gallery of Avidya (Ignorance) or Maya  (Illusion).  If the real orthography of the name by which the sign in  question is indicated is properly understood, it will readily be seen  that the next three signs are not what they ought to be.    --------  * Nevertheless it is a true one.  The Jiv-atma in the Microcosm (man) is  the same spiritual essence which animates the Macrocosm (universe), the  differentiation, or specific difference between the two Jivatmas  presenting itself but in the two states or conditions of the same and  one Force.  Hence, \"this son of Paramatma\" is an eternal correlation of  the Father-Cause. Purusha manifesting himself as Brahma of the \"golden  egg\" and becoming Viradja--the universe.  We are \"all born of Aditi from  the water\" (Hymns of the Maruts, X. 63, 2), and \"Being was born from  not-being\" (Rig-Veda, Mandala I, Sukta 166).--Ed. Theos.  -----------    Kanya or Virgo and Vrischika or Scorpio should form one single sign, and  Thula must follow the said sign if it is at all necessary to have a  separate sign of that name.  But a separation between Kanya and  Vrischika was effected by interposing the sign Tula between the two.  The object of this separation will be understood on examining the  meaning of the three signs.    VI. Kanya.--Means a virgin and represents Sakti or Mahamaya.  The sign  in question is the sixth Rasi or division, and indicates that there are  six primary forces in Nature.  These forces have different sets of names  in Sanskrit philosophy.  According to one system of nomenclature, they  are called by the following names*:--(1) Parasakty;  (2) Gnanasakti;  (3) Itchasakti (will-power); (4) Kriytisakti;  (5) Kundalinisakti;  and  (6) Matrikasakti.  The six forces are in their unity represented by the  Astral Light.**    ---------  * Parasakti:--Literally the great or supreme force or power. It means  and includes the powers of light and heat.    Gnanasakti:--Literally the power of intellect or the power of real  wisdom or knowledge.  It has two aspects.    I. The following are some of its manifestations when placed under the  influence or control of material conditions.    (a) The power of the mind in interpreting our sensations;  (b) Its power  in recalling past ideas (memory) and raising future expectation;  (c)  Its power as exhibited in what are called by modern psychologists \"the  laws of association,\" which enables it to form persisting connections  between various groups of sensations and possibilities of sensations,  and thus generate the notion or idea of an external object;  (d) Its  power in connecting our ideas together by the mysterious link of memory,  and thus generating the notion of self or individuality.    II. The following are some of its manifestations when liberated from the  bonds of matter:--    (a) Clairvoyance.  (b) Pyschometry.    Itchasakti:--Literally the power of the will.  Its most ordinary  manifestation is the generation of certain nerve currents which set in  motion such muscles as are required for the accomplishment of the  desired object.    Kriyasakti:--The mysterious power of thought which enables it to produce  external, perceptible, phenomenal results by its own inherent energy.  The ancients held that any idea will manifest itself externally if one's  attention is deeply concentrated upon it.  Similarly an intense volition  will be followed by the desired result.    A Yogi generally performs his wonders by means of Itchasakti and  Kriyasakti.    Kundalinisakti:--Literally the power or force which moves in a  serpentine or curved path.  It is the universal life-principle which  everywhere manifests itself in Nature.  This force includes in itself  the two great forces of attraction and repulsion. Electricity and  magnetism are but manifestations of it.  This is the power or force  which brings about that \"continuous adjustment of internal relations to  external relations\" which is the essence of life according to Herbert  Spencer, and that \"continuous adjustment of external relations to  internal relations\" which is the basis of transmigration of souls or  punarjanmam (re-birth) according to the doctrines of the ancient Hindu  philosophers.    A Yogi must thoroughly subjugate this power or force before he can  attain moksham.  This force is, in fact, the great serpent of the Bible.    Matrikasakti:--Literally the force or power of letters or speech or  music.  The whole of the ancient Mantra Shastra has this force or power  in all its manifestations for its subject-matter.  The power of The Word  which Jesus Christ speaks of is a manifestation of this Sakti.  The  influence of its music is one of its ordinary manifestations.  The power  of the mirific ineffable name is the crown of this Sakti.    Modern science has but partly investigated the first, second and fifth  of the forces or powers above named, but it is altogether in the dark as  regards the remaining powers.    ** Even the very name of Kanya (Virgin) shows how all the ancient  esoteric systems agreed in all their fundamental doctrines.  The  Kabalists and the Hermetic philosophers call the Astral Light the  \"heavenly or celestial Virgin.\"  The Astral Light in its unity is the  7th.  Hence the seven principles diffused in every unity or the 6 and  one--two triangles and a crown.--Ed. Theos.  -----------    VII. Tula.--When represented by numbers according to the method above  alluded to, this word will be converted into 36.  This sign, therefore,  is evidently intended to represent the 36 Tatwams.  (The number of  Tatwams is different according to the views of different philosophers  but by Sakteyas generally and by several of the ancient Rishis, such as  Agastya, Dvrasa and Parasurama, &c., the number of Tatwams has been  stated to be 36). Jivatma differs from Paramatma, or to state the same  thing in other words, \"Baddha\" differs from \"Mukta\" * in being encased  as it were within these 36 Tatwams, while the other is free.  This sign  prepares the way to earthly Adam to Nara.  As the emblem of Nara it is  properly placed as the seventh sign.    ---------  * As the Infinite differs from the Finite and the Unconditioned  from the Conditioned.--Ed. Theos.  ---------    VIII. Vrischika.--It is stated by ancient philosophers that the sun when  located in this Rasi or sign is called by the name of Vishnu (see the  12th Skandha of Bhagavata).  This sign is intended to represent Vishnu.  Vishnu literally means that which is expanded--expanded as Viswam or  Universe.  Properly speaking, Viswam itself is Vishnu (see  Sankaracharya's commentary on Vishnusahasranamam).  I have already  intimated that Vishnu represents the Swapnavastha or the Dreaming State.  The sign in question properly signifies the universe in thought or the  universe in the divine conception.    It is properly placed as the sign opposite to Rishabham or Pranava.  Analysis from Pranava downwards leads to the Universe of Thought, and  synthesis from the latter upwards leads to Pranava (Aum).  We have now  arrived at the ideal state of the universe previous to its coming into  material existence.  The expansion of the Vija or primitive germ into  the universe is only possible when the 36 \"Tatwams\" * are interposed  between the Maya and Jivatma.  The dreaming state is induced through the  instrumentality of these \"Tatwams.\"  It is the existence of these  Tatwams that brings Hamsa into existence.  The elimination of these  Tatwams marks the beginning of the synthesis towards Pranava and Brahmam  and converts Hamsa into Soham.  As it is intended to represent the  different stages of evolution from Brahmam downwards to the material  universe, the three signs Kanya, Tula, and Vrischika are placed in the  order in which they now stand as three separate signs.    IX. Dhanus (Sagittarius).--When represented in numbers the name is  equivalent to 9, and the division in question is the 9th division  counting from Mesha.  The sign, therefore, clearly indicates the 9  Brahmas--the 9 Parajapatis who assisted the Demiurgus in constructing  the material universe.    X. Makara.--There is some difficulty in interpreting this word;  nevertheless it contains within itself the clue to its correct  interpretation.  The letter Ma is equivalent to number 5, and Kara means  hand.  Now in Sanskrit Thribhujam means a triangle, bhujam or karam  (both are synonymous) being understood to mean a side.  So, Makaram or  Panchakaram means a Pentagon.**    ----------  * 36 is three times 12, or 9 Tetraktis, or 12 Triads, the most sacred  number in the Kabalistic and Pythagorean numerals.--Ed. Theos.    ** The five-pointed star or pentagram represented the five limbs of  man.--Ed. Theos.  ----------    Now, Makaram is the tenth sign, and the term \"Dasadisa\" is generally  used by Sanskrit writers to denote the faces or sides of the universe.  The sign in question is intended to represent the faces of the universe,  and indicates that the figure of the universe is bounded by Pentagons.  If we take the pentagons as regular pentagons (on the presumption or  supposition that the universe is symmetrically constructed) the figure  of the material universe will, of course, be a Dodecahedron, the  geometrical model imitated by the Demiurgus in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14392"],[0,"George Du Maurier, the Satirist of the Victorians (#18)"],[1,"than a wit. Both were men of fancy rather than of  imagination, men of sentiment rather than of passion. Both, too, were  fantastics; both loved what was beautiful and graceful rather than  what was grand; but du Maurier was more of the pure artist, while to  Ainger the moral side of beauty most appealed.... Both men were gifted  with an exquisite kindness.... Du Maurier was the keener and clearer  thinker of the two; he had the wider outlook and the fewer prejudices.\"  Their closest bond was _Punch_, which was to Ainger a delight from cover  to cover.    [Illustration: Canon Ainger    Portrait in water-colour by du Maurier. In the possession of the  artist's widow.]    The artist's love of Whitby is well known; he expressed it himself in  his _Punch_ drawings over and over again. He wrote to Ainger in 1891:  \"It is delightful to get a letter from you at Whitby--the place we all  like best in the world.\" He gives a list of places and things to be  especially seen there, among them the cottage of Sylvia Robson of  _Sylvia's Lovers_, and No 1 St. Hilda's Terrace, \"the humble but  singularly charming little house where your friends have dwelt, and  would fain dwell again (and two of them end their days there, somewhere  towards the middle of the twentieth century).\"    It was at Whitby when Ainger and his nieces were there with the du  Mauriers that they were once delighted by seeing \"Trilby Drops\"  advertised in a little village sweet-shop. \"Such is fame,\" said du  Maurier, but when his daughter went in to ask about the \"drops,\" the  girl behind the counter had no idea what \"Trilby\" meant.    In the summer numbers of past volumes of _Punch_ Whitby has figured in  the background of seaside scenes perhaps more than any other  watering-place. Du Maurier nearly always drew upon it for seaside  pictures and the humour of the summer holidays. He formed his first  acquaintance with it in illustrating _Sylvia's Lovers_. The scene of  that tale is Whitby under another name. Thus he started his connection  with the town in circumstances that seemed to him to give it a glamour.  Not only did he confess an immense liking for Mrs. Gaskell's novel, but,  as we have seen, he scored in the illustration of it the first of his  great successes with the general public. The gift of illustration, after  all, is a very rare one. Nothing is to be understood more easily than  the value the public began to put upon du Maurier's gift. In a response  of that sort the public display true discrimination. The ascendency of  du Maurier as a _Punch_ artist was more than anything due to the fact  that for his work in that paper he drew upon the sentiment of family  life from the resources of his own experience. And nothing that we  could write here would so entirely reveal the happy character of his own  family life as the reigning atmosphere of the \"seaside\" and \"nursery\"  pictures which he contributed to _Punch_.    [Illustration]      Section 7    Many people remembering du Maurier's satires entertained a little fear  of him in Society, and of what he might be thinking about them. An  instance of this was shown on one occasion when he was dining alone with  Sir John Millais at the latter's splendid residence. \"I suppose,\" said  Millais, waving his hand in the direction of the disappearing flunkeys  after dinner, \"you think all this very _Sir Gorgius Midas-y_? To me it  is merely respectable.\" As a matter of fact there is everything to show  that du Maurier entertained the same sort of notions of \"respectability\"  as his host, though he did things on a less magnificent scale. By  temperament he was not quite a Bohemian, although he was convivial. It  was the convivial side of the weekly _Punch_ dinner that appealed to  him. He abstained from these meetings, or came in late, when a tendency  prevailed to make them too much, as he thought, the pretext of business.  He was regarded as singular in ordering an immense cup of tea to be put  before him immediately after dinner. He sat over his cup of tea with a  bent back, always with a cigarette, fuming whilst the business part  of the proceedings went forward. When that was over he entered into his  own, regaling his comrades with droll stories, creating a witty  atmosphere at his own corner by his taste for repartee.    [Illustration: The Mutual Admirationists    (Fragments overheard by Grigsby and the Colonel at one of Prigsby's  Afternoon Teas.)      _Young Maudle_ (_to Mrs. Lyon Hunter and her Daughters_). \"In the  supremest Poetry, Shakespeare's for instance, or Postlethwaite's, or  Shelley's one always feels that,\" &c., &c., &c.    _Young Postlethwaite_ (_to the three Miss Bilderbogies_). \"The  _greatest_ Painters of ALL, such as Velasquez, or Maudle, or even  Titian, invariably suggest to one,\" &c., &c., &c.    _Punch_, May 22, 1880.]    The difficulties with his sight might well have been expected to poison  the artist's well of happiness. But it was noticed of Charles Lamb that  the very fact of possessing the little pleasures of everyday life only  under a lease, as it were, which Fate at any moment might refuse to  renew, caused him to be the very poet of such pleasures, experiencing  them with an acuteness that became to him an inspiration. With du  Maurier the enjoyment of social life, so manifestly evident in his art  at one time, may well have been entered into with something of the  fierce delight with which we take our sunshine in a rainy summer. In  later years he became home-staying in his habits. One imagines he felt  that he had taken from Society all that it had to give him--the  knowledge of life necessary to him in his work, and friends in  sufficient number. It is from about this time that his art shows  evidence that an intimate contact with the social movement was no longer  sustained. The tendency to repeat himself, to produce his weekly  picture by a sort of formula, becomes noticeable; and the absence of  variety in his work becomes oppressive.    Du Maurier was a man of great natural versatility. For some reason or  other he was not fond of the theatre, but he was in possession of a  considerable genius for monodrama, and often delighted his friends by  his impersonations. We have seen that it was once within the bounds of  possibility that he would have become a professional singer. His  conversational gifts were great. He was a writer of singular  picturesqueness. A considerable interest in the progress of science was  noted in him to the last. If we look back at the record of the lives of  artists to find what manner of men as a rule they were, we shall find  that, in contradistinction to poets and musicians, they were pre-eminent  as men of the world. Skill in plastic art seems a final gift imparted to  men very highly constituted. It steals them entirely away from other  aims, but exists side by side with, while yet it transcends the ability  to achieve remarkable performances in dissimilar directions. Perhaps it  is because, of all men, the true artist regards the material world with  the clearest vision, living in no world of dreams, finding reality  itself so delightful.    The artist never at any stage of his life lost the rollicking spirit of  a boy. It broke out in conversation and in his letters. In narration he  reserved the right of every _raconteur_ to make a point by some  exaggeration. In letters of his that I have seen the note of high  spirits may be said to be the prevailing one.    For instance, to the head of the _Punch_ Firm, after a _Punch_ dinner:         \"_Jan._ 14.         \"Would you allow one of your retainers to look under the table and       see if I left a golosh there--and if so, tell him to leave it at       Swain's, to be returned by his messenger on Monday? I must have       been tight, and the golosh not tight enough, and I appeared at the       Duchess's with one golosh and my trousers tucked up. H.R.H. was       much concerned about it, and said, 'It's all that ---- _Punch_       dinner!'\"    To the same:         \"I'm on for the 25th at the Albion and much delighted. Is it       evening dress? If not, tip us a card. If you do not I shall       conclude it is, and appear in full togs, which I will get out for       the evening.    [Illustration:             O           |          /|\\         / | \\        O  O  O    (Attenborough)]         \"I had really hoped to have got down to Bouverie Street yesterday,       but the conviction forced itself on me as the day wore on that I       should never get a cab to bring me back. I know I am a back-slider       in the matter of the _Punch_ dinner (and all other dinners when I       can help it). I can get thro' my work so much better after the       frugal home repast, and in bed before 11 P.M. Not that I have been       able to indulge in the early couch these holidays, for Hampstead,       slow as it is, is a fearful place for juvenile dissipation, and       parents have to sit up night after night at Xmas time. I hope you       Wandsworthians have more sense.\"    In an earlier stage of the book we fixed the period at which du  Maurier's work in _Punch_ was at the height of its vitality at about  1879--and on into the early \"eighties.\" And the artist himself seems to  have had a strong feeling of increasing power at this time. In January  1880 he approached _Punch_ for a revision of the prices at which he was  then working. By the courtesy of Mr. W. Laurence Bradbury I am able to  quote in part from letters bearing out the inference that it was at this  time that du Maurier entered into consciousness of his own worth:         \"_Jan._ 1, 1880.         \"DEAR BRADBURY, AGNEW, & Co.,--The time has come when I think I may       fairly ask you to make an increase in my salary.         \"The quality of my work has greatly improved of late years and my       popularity has grown in proportion, and these results have been       obtained at great expense of thought and labour, and I find as"]]]
