A certain amount of moonlight found access to the room, without  spreading so far as the bed in which my friend lay. But at the moment  of my headlong entrance, and before I had switched on the light, my gaze  automatically was directed to the pale moonbeam streaming through the  window and down on to one corner of the sheep-skin rug beside the bed.    There came a sound of faint and muffled coughing.    What with my recent awakening and the panic at my heart, I could not  claim that my vision was true; but across this moonbeam passed a sort of  gray streak, for all the world as though some long thin shape had been  withdrawn, snakelike, from the room, through the open window... From  somewhere outside the house, and below, I heard the cough again,  followed by a sharp cracking sound like the lashing of a whip.    I depressed the switch, flooding the room with light, and as I leaped  forward to the bed a word picture of what I had seen formed in my mind;  and I found that I was thinking of a gray feather boa.    \"Smith!\" I cried (my voice seemed to pitch itself, unwilled, in a very  high key), \"Smith, old man!\"    He made no reply, and a sudden, sorrowful fear clutched at my  heart-strings. He was lying half out of bed flat upon his back, his head  at a dreadful angle with his body. As I bent over him and seized him by  the shoulders, I could see the whites of his eyes. His arms hung limply,  and his fingers touched the carpet.    \"My God!\" I whispered--\"what has happened?\"    I heaved him back onto the pillow, and looked anxiously into his face.  Habitually gaunt, the flesh so refined away by the consuming nervous  energy of the man as to reveal the cheekbones in sharp prominence, he  now looked truly ghastly. His skin was so sunbaked as to have changed  constitutionally; nothing could ever eradicate that tan. But to-night a  fearful grayness was mingled with the brown, his lips were purple... and  there were marks of strangulation upon the lean throat--ever darkening  weals made by clutching fingers.    He began to breathe stentoriously and convulsively, inhalation being  accompanied by a significant gurgling in the throat. But now my calm was  restored in face of a situation which called for professional attention.    I aided my friend's labored respirations by the usual means, setting to  work vigorously; so that presently he began to clutch at his inflamed  throat which that murderous pressure had threatened to close.    I could hear sounds of movement about the house, showing that not I  alone had been awakened by those hoarse screams.    \"It's all right, old man,\" I said, bending over him; \"brace up!\"    He opened his eyes--they looked bleared and bloodshot--and gave me a  quick glance of recognition.    \"It's all right, Smith!\" I said--\"no! don't sit up; lie there for a  moment.\"    I ran across to the dressing-table, whereon I perceived his flask to  lie, and mixed him a weak stimulant with which I returned to the bed.    As I bent over him again, my housekeeper appeared in the doorway, pale  and wide-eyed.    \"There is no occasion for alarm,\" I said over my shoulder; \"Mr. Smith's  nerves are overwrought and he was awakened by some disturbing dream. You  can return to bed, Mrs. Newsome.\"    Nayland Smith seemed to experience much difficulty in swallowing the  contents of the tumbler which I held to his lips; and, from the way in  which he fingered the swollen glands, I could see that his throat,  which I had vigorously massaged, was occasioning him great pain. But the  danger was past, and already that glassy look was disappearing from his  eyes, nor did they protrude so unnaturally.    \"God, Petrie!\" he whispered, \"that was a near shave! I haven't the  strength of a kitten!\"    \"The weakness will pass off,\" I replied; \"there will be no collapse,  now. A little more fresh air...\"    I stood up, glancing at the windows, then back at Smith, who forced a  wry smile in answer to my look.    \"Couldn't be done, Petrie,\" he said, huskily.    His words referred to the state of the windows. Although the night was  oppressively hot, these were only opened some four inches at top and  bottom. Further opening was impossible because of iron brackets screwed  firmly into the casements which prevented the windows being raised or  lowered further.    It was a precaution adopted after long experience of the servants of Dr.  Fu-Manchu.    Now, as I stood looking from the half-strangled man upon the bed to  those screwed-up windows, the fact came home to my mind that this  precaution had proved futile. I thought of the thing which I had likened  to a feather boa; and I looked at the swollen weals made by clutching  fingers upon the throat of Nayland Smith.    The bed stood fully four feet from the nearest window.    I suppose the question was written in my face; for, as I turned again  to Smith, who, having struggled upright, was still fingering his injured  throat ruefully:    \"God only knows, Petrie!\" he said; \"no human arm could have reached  me...\"    For us, the night was ended so far as sleep was concerned. Arrayed in  his dressing-gown, Smith sat in the white cane chair in my study with  a glass of brandy-and-water beside him, and (despite my official  prohibition) with the cracked briar which had sent up its incense in  many strange and dark places of the East and which yet survived to  perfume these prosy rooms in suburban London, steaming between his  teeth. I stood with my elbow resting upon the mantelpiece looking down  at him where he sat.    \"By God! Petrie,\" he said, yet again, with his fingers straying gently  over the surface of his throat, \"that was a narrow shave--a damned  narrow shave!\"    \"Narrower than perhaps you appreciate, old man,\" I replied. \"You were a  most unusual shade of blue when I found you...\"    \"I managed,\" said Smith evenly, \"to tear those clutching fingers away  for a moment and to give a cry for help. It was only for a moment,  though. Petrie! they were fingers of steel--of steel!\"    \"The bed,\" I began...    \"I know that,\" rapped Smith. \"I shouldn't have been sleeping in it, had  it been within reach of the window; but, knowing that the doctor avoids  noisy methods, I had thought myself fairly safe so long as I made it  impossible for any one actually to enter the room...\"    \"I have always insisted, Smith,\" I cried, \"that there was danger! What  of poisoned darts? What of the damnable reptiles and insects which form  part of the armory of Fu-Manchu?\"    \"Familiarity breeds contempt, I suppose,\" he replied. \"But as it  happened none of those agents was employed. The very menace that I  sought to avoid reached me somehow. It would almost seem that Dr.  Fu-Manchu deliberately accepted the challenge of those screwed-up  windows! Hang it all, Petrie! one cannot sleep in a room hermetically  sealed, in weather like this! It's positively Burmese; and although I  can stand tropical heat, curiously enough the heat of London gets me  down almost immediately.\"    \"The humidity; that's easily understood. But you'll have to put up with  it in the future. After nightfall our windows must be closed entirely,  Smith.\"    Nayland Smith knocked out his pipe upon the side of the fireplace. The  bowl sizzled furiously, but without delay he stuffed broad-cut mixture  into the hot pipe, dropping a liberal quantity upon the carpet during  the process. He raised his eyes to me, and his face was very grim.    \"Petrie,\" he said, striking a match on the heel of his slipper, \"the  resources of Dr. Fu-Manchu are by no means exhausted. Before we quit  this room it is up to us to come to a decision upon a certain point.\" He  got his pipe well alight. \"What kind of thing, what unnatural, distorted  creature, laid hands upon my throat to-night? I owe my life, primarily,  to you, old man, but, secondarily, to the fact that I was awakened, just  before the attack--by the creature's coughing--by its vile, high-pitched  coughing...\"    I glanced around at the books upon my shelves. Often enough, following  some outrage by the brilliant Chinese doctor whose genius was directed  to the discovery of new and unique death agents, we had obtained a clue  in those works of a scientific nature which bulk largely in the  library of a medical man. There are creatures, there are drugs, which,  ordinarily innocuous, may be so employed as to become inimical to human  life; and in the distorting of nature, in the disturbing of balances and  the diverting of beneficent forces into strange and dangerous channels,  Dr. Fu-Manchu excelled. I had known him to enlarge, by artificial  culture, a minute species of fungus so as to render it a powerful agent  capable of attacking man; his knowledge of venomous insects has probably  never been paralleled in the history of the world; whilst, in the sphere  of pure toxicology, he had, and has, no rival; the Borgias were children  by comparison. But, look where I would, think how I might, no adequate  explanation of this latest outrage seemed possible along normal lines.    \"There's the clue,\" said Nayland Smith, pointing to a little ash-tray  upon the table near by. \"Follow it if you can.\"    But I could not.    \"As I have explained,\" continued my friend, \"I was awakened by a sound  of coughing; then came a death grip on my throat, and instinctively my  hands shot out in search of my attacker. I could not reach him; my  hands came in contact with nothing palpable. Therefore I clutched at the  fingers which were dug into my windpipe, and found them to be small--as  the marks show--and hairy. I managed to give that first cry for  help, then with all my strength I tried to unfasten the grip that was  throttling the life out of me. At last I contrived to move one of the  hands, and I called out again, though not so loudly. Then both the hands  were back again; I was weakening; but I clawed like a madman"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#18)"],[1," Violent as it was, an editorial note witnesses that it  was modified. It must have covered Pawkins with shame and confusion of  face. It left no loophole; it was murderous in argument, and utterly  contemptuous in tone; an awful thing for the declining years of a man's  career.    The world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from  Pawkins. He would try one, for Pawkins had always been game. But when it  came it surprised them. For the rejoinder of Pawkins was to catch  influenza, proceed to pneumonia, and die.    It was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the  circumstances, and largely turned the current of feeling against Hapley.  The very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became  serious at the consequence. There could be no reasonable doubt the fret of  the defeat had contributed to the death of Pawkins. There was a limit even  to scientific controversy, said serious people. Another crushing attack  was already in the press and appeared on the day before the funeral. I  don't think Hapley exerted himself to stop it. People remembered how  Hapley had hounded down his rival, and forgot that rival's defects.  Scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould. The thing provoked comment in  the daily papers. This it was that made me think that you had probably  heard of Hapley and this controversy. But, as I have already remarked,  scientific workers live very much in a world of their own; half the  people, I dare say, who go along Piccadilly to the Academy every year,  could not tell you where the learned societies abide. Many even think that  research is a kind of happy-family cage in which all kinds of men lie down  together in peace.    In his private thoughts Hapley could not forgive Pawkins for dying. In  the first place, it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation  Hapley had in hand for him, and in the second, it left Hapley's mind with  a queer gap in it. For twenty years he had worked hard, sometimes far  into the night, and seven days a week, with microscope, scalpel,  collecting-net, and pen, and almost entirely with reference to Pawkins.  The European reputation he had won had come as an incident in that great  antipathy. He had gradually worked up to a climax in this last  controversy. It had killed Pawkins, but it had also thrown Hapley out of  gear, so to speak, and his doctor advised him to give up work for a time,  and rest. So Hapley went down into a quiet village in Kent, and thought  day and night of Pawkins, and good things it was now impossible to say  about him.    At last Hapley began to realise in what direction the pre-occupation  tended. He determined to make a fight for it, and started by trying to  read novels. But he could not get his mind off Pawkins, white in the face  and making his last speech--every sentence a beautiful opening for Hapley.  He turned to fiction--and found it had no grip on him. He read the \"Island  Nights' Entertainments\" until his \"sense of causation\" was shocked beyond  endurance by the Bottle Imp. Then he went to Kipling, and found he \"proved  nothing,\" besides being irreverent and vulgar. These scientific people  have their limitations. Then unhappily, he tried Besant's \"Inner House,\"  and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned societies and Pawkins at  once.    So Hapley turned to chess, and found it a little more soothing. He soon  mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions,  and began to beat the Vicar. But then the cylindrical contours of the  opposite king began to resemble Pawkins standing up and gasping  ineffectually against check-mate, and Hapley decided to give up chess.    Perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better  diversion. The best rest is change of occupation. Hapley determined to  plunge at diatoms, and had one of his smaller microscopes and Halibut's  monograph sent down from London. He thought that perhaps if he could get  up a vigorous quarrel with Halibut, he might be able to begin life afresh  and forget Pawkins. And very soon he was hard at work in his habitual  strenuous fashion, at these microscopic denizens of the way-side pool.    It was on the third day of the diatoms that Hapley became aware of a novel  addition to the local fauna. He was working late at the microscope, and  the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special  form of green shade. Like all experienced microscopists, he kept both eyes  open. It is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue. One eye was over the  instrument, and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of  the microscope, across which a brown diatom was slowly moving. With the  other eye Hapley saw, as it were, without seeing. He was only dimly  conscious of the brass side of the instrument, the illuminated part of the  table-cloth, a sheet of notepaper, the foot of the lamp, and the darkened  room beyond.    Suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other. The table-cloth  was of the material called tapestry by shopmen, and rather brightly  coloured. The pattern was in gold, with a small amount of crimson and pale  blue upon a greyish ground. At one point the pattern seemed displaced, and  there was a vibrating movement of the colours at this point.    Hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes. His mouth  fell open with astonishment.    It was a large moth or butterfly; its wings spread in butterfly fashion!    It was strange it should be in the room at all, for the windows were  closed. Strange that it should not have attracted his attention when  fluttering to its present position. Strange that it should match the  table-cloth. Stranger far that to him, Hapley, the great entomologist, it  was altogether unknown. There was no delusion. It was crawling slowly  towards the foot of the lamp.    \"New Genus, by heavens! And in England!\" said Hapley, staring.    Then he suddenly thought of Pawkins. Nothing would have maddened Pawkins  more...And Pawkins was dead!    Something about the head and body of the insect became singularly  suggestive of Pawkins, just as the chess king had been.    \"Confound Pawkins!\" said Hapley. \"But I must catch this.\" And looking  round him for some means of capturing the moth, he rose slowly out of his  chair. Suddenly the insect rose, struck the edge of the lampshade--Hapley  heard the \"ping\"--and vanished into the shadow.    In a moment Hapley had whipped off the shade, so that the whole room was  illuminated. The thing had disappeared, but soon his practised eye  detected it upon the wall-paper near the door. He went towards it poising  the lamp-shade for capture. Before he was within striking distance,  however, it had risen and was fluttering round the room. After the fashion  of its kind, it flew with sudden starts and turns, seeming to vanish here  and reappear there. Once Hapley struck, and missed; then again.    The third time he hit his microscope. The instrument swayed, struck and  overturned the lamp, and fell noisily upon the floor. The lamp turned over  on the table and, very luckily, went out. Hapley was left in the dark.  With a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face.    It was maddening. He had no lights. If he opened the door of the room the  thing would get away. In the darkness he saw Pawkins quite distinctly  laughing at him. Pawkins had ever an oily laugh. He swore furiously and  stamped his foot on the floor.    There was a timid rapping at the door.    Then it opened, perhaps a foot, and very slowly. The alarmed face of the  landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame; she wore a night-cap over  her grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders. \"What  _was_ that fearful smash?\" she said. \"Has anything----\" The strange  moth appeared fluttering about the chink of the door. \"Shut that door!\"  said Hapley, and suddenly rushed at her.    The door slammed hastily. Hapley was left alone in the dark. Then in the  pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs, lock her door, and drag  something heavy across the room and put against it.    It became evident to Hapley that his conduct and appearance had been  strange and alarming. Confound the moth! and Pawkins! However, it was a  pity to lose the moth now. He felt his way into the hall and found the  matches, after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a  drum. With the lighted candle he returned to the sitting-room. No moth was  to be seen. Yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering  round his head. Hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to  bed. But he was excited. All night long his sleep was broken by dreams of  the moth, Pawkins, and his landlady. Twice in the night he turned out and  soused his head in cold water.    One thing was very clear to him. His landlady could not possibly  understand about the strange moth, especially as he had failed to catch  it. No one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt. She was  probably frightened at his behaviour, and yet he failed to see how he  could explain it. He decided to say nothing further about the events of  last night. After breakfast he saw her in her garden, and decided to go  out and talk to reassure her. He talked to her about beans and potatoes,  bees, caterpillars, and the price of fruit. She replied in her usual  manner, but she looked at him a little suspiciously, and kept walking as  he walked, so that there was always a bed of flowers, or a row of beans,  or something of the sort, between them. After a while he began to feel  singularly irritated at this, and to conceal his vexation went indoors and  presently went out for a walk.    The moth, or butterfly, trailing an odd flavour of Pawkins with it, kept  coming into that walk, though he did his best to keep his mind off it.  Once he saw it quite distinctly, with its wings flattened out, upon the  old"]]]
