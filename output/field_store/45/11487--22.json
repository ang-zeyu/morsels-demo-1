Take all these  herbs, and order them so, as that the hot herbs may be mastered with the  cool. Then take the small herbs, and put them into the Furnace, and lay the  long herbs upon them. Then take a weight or stone of Lead, having a Ring,  whereunto fasten a stick to keep down the Herbs into the furnace; then boil  your water and herbs three or four hours, and as the water doth boil away,  adde more. Then take the water out of the Furnace seething hot, and strain  it through a Range-sieve; then put in the honey, and Mash it well  together: then take your Sweet-wort, and strain it through a Range. Then  try it with a New-laid-egg. It must be so strong as to bear an Egg the  breadth of a groat above the Liquor: and if it doth not, then put in more  honey, till it will bear the Egg. Then take the Liquor, and boil it again;  and as soon as it doth boil, skim the froth very clean from it: Then set it  a cooling, and when it is cold, then put it into a Kive, and put barm  thereto, and let it work the Space of a Week; Then Tun it up: But be  careful when it is Tunned, that the vessels be not stopp'd up, till it hath  done hissing.      ANOTHER SORT OF METHEGLIN    Take to one part of honey, three parts of water: and put them into clean  vessels, mixing them very well together, and breaking the honey with  stripped arms, till it be well dissolved. Then pour out your Liquor into a  large Kettle, and let it boil for two hours and a half, over a good fire,  skiming it all the while very carefully as long as any scum riseth. When it  is boiled enough, pour out your Liquor into clean vessels, and set it to  cool for 24 hours. Afterwards put it into some Runlets, and cover the bung  with a piece of Lead: have a care to fill it up always with the same boiled  Liquor for three or four months and during the time of working. This Meath  the older it is, the better it is. But if you will have your Meath red,  then take twenty pound of black Currants, and put them into a vessel, and  pour your Liquor on them. Of this honey-Liquor you cannot drink till after  nine months, or a year.      MY LORD HERBERT'S MEATH    Take ten Gallons of water; and to every Gallon of water a quart of honey, a  handful and a half of Rosemary, one Ounce of Mace, one Ounce and a half of  Nutmegs, as much Cinamon, half an Ounce of Cloves, a quarter of a pound of  Ginger scraped and cut in pieces. Put all these into the water, and let it  boil half an hour, then take it off the fire, and let it stand, till you  may see your shadow in it. Then put in the honey, and set it upon the fire  again. Then take the shells and whites of a dozen of Eggs, and beat them  both very well together: and when it is ready to boil up, put in your Eggs,  and stir it; then skim it clean, and take it off the fire, and put it into  vessels to cool, as you do wort. When it is cold, set it together with some  barm, as you do Beer. When it is put together leave the settlings behind in  the bottom; as soon as it is white over, Tun it up in a vessel, and when it  hath done working, stop it up as you do Beer. When it is three weeks old,  it will be fit to bottle or drink.      ANOTHER WHITE MEATH    Take three Pound of White-honey, or the best Hampshire-honey, and dissolve  it in a Gallon of water, and then boil it; and when it beginneth first to  boil, put into it half a quarter of an Ounce of Ginger a little bruised;  and a very little Cloves and Mace bruised, and a small quantity of  Agrimony. Let all this boil together a full hour, and keep it constantly  skimmed, as long as any Scum will rise upon it. Then strain it forth into  some clean Kiver or other vessel, and let stand a cooling; and when it is  cold, let it stand, till it be all creamed over with a blackish cream, and  that it make a kind of hissing noise; then put it up into your vessel, and  in two or three months time it will be fit to drink.    Look how much you intend to make, the same quantities must be allowed to  every Gallon of water.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take fair water, and the best honey; beat them well together, but not in a  woodden vessel, for wood drinketh up the honey, put it together in a  Kettle, and try it with a New-laid-egg, which will swim at top, if it be  very strong; but if it bob up and sink again, it will be too weak. Boil it  an hour, and put into it a bundle of herbs, what sort you like best; and a  little bag of Spice, Nutmegs, Ginger, Cloves, Mace and Cinamon; and skim it  well all the while it boileth: when it hath boiled an hour, take it off,  and put it into earthen Pans, and so let it stand till next day. Then pour  off all the clear into a good vessel, that hath had Sack in it, or  White-wine. Hang the bag of Spice in it, and so let it stand very close  stopp'd and well filled for a month, or longer. Then if you desire to drink  it quickly, you may bottle it up. If it be strong of the honey, you may  keep it a year or two. If weak, drink it in two or three months. One quart  of honey, will make one Gallon of water very strong. A sprig or two of  Rose-mary, Thyme and Sweet-marjoram, are the Herbs that should go into it.      TO MAKE SMALL METHEGLIN    Take to every quart of White-honey, six quarts of fair-water. Let it boil,  until a third part be boiled away; skiming it as it riseth: then put into  it a small quantity of Ginger largely sliced; then put it out into earthen  Pans, till it be Luke-warm, and so put it up into an earthen stand, with a  tap in it. Then put to it about half a Porenger-ful of the best Ale-yest,  so beat it well together; Then cover it with a cloth, and it will be twelve  hours before it work; and afterwards let it stand two days, and then draw  it out into stone bottles, and it will be ready to drink in five or six  days after. This proportion of yest (which is about six good spoonfuls) is  enough for three or four Gallons of Liquor. The yest must be of good Ale,  and very new. You may mingle the yest first with a little of the  Luke-warm-Liquor; then beat it, till it be well incorporated, and begins to  work; Then adde a little more Liquor to it, and beat that. Continue so  adding the Liquor by little and little, till a good deal of it be  Incorporated with the yest; then put that to all the rest of the quantity,  and beat it altogether very well; then cover it close, and keep it warm for  two or three days. Before you bottle it, scum away all the barm and Ginger  (whereof a spoonful or two is enough for three or four Gallons) then bottle  up the clear, leaving the dregs. If you will, you may Tun it into a barrel,  (if you make a greater quantity) when the barm is well Incorporated with  the Liquor, in the same manner as you do Beer or Ale, and so let it work in  the Barrel as long as it will; then stop it up close for a few days more,  that so it may clear it self well, and separate and precipitate the dregs.  Then draw the clear into bottles. This will make it less windy, but also a  little less quick, though more wholesome. You may also boil a little  handful of tops of Rosemary in the Liquor, which giveth it a fine taste:  but all other herbs, and particularly Sweet-marjoram and Thyme, give it a  Physical taste. A little Limon-peel giveth it a very fine taste. If you Tun  it in a barrel, to work there, you may hang the Ginger and Limon-peel in it  in a bag, till you bottle it, or till it have done working. Then you may  put two or three stoned and sliced Raisins, and a lump of fine Sugar into  every bottle to make it quick.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take five Gallons of water, and one Gallon of good White-honey; set it on  the fire together, and boil it very well, and skim it very clean; Then take  it off the fire, and set it by. Take six ounces of good Ginger, and two  ounces of Cinamon, one Ounce of Nutmegs; bruise all these grosly, and put  them into your hot Liquor, and cover it close, and so let it stand, till it  be cold. Then put as much Ale-barm to it, as will make it work; then keep  it in a warm place, as you do Ale; and when it hath wrought well, Tun it  up, as you do Ale or Beer: and when it is a week old, drink of it at your  pleasure.      AN EXCELLENT METHEGLIN    Take Spring-water, and boil it with Rose-mary, Sage, Sweet-Marjoram, Balm  and Sassafras, until it hath boiled three or four hours: The quantity of  the Herbs is a handful of them all, of each a like proportion, to a Gallon  of water. And when it is boiled, set it to cool and to settle until the  next day: Then strain your water, and mix it with honey, until it will  bear an Egg the breadth of a Groat. Then set it over the fire to boil. Take  the whites of twenty or thirty Eggs, and beat them mightily, and when it  boileth, pour them in at twice; stir it well together, and then let it  stand, until it boileth a pace before you scum it, and then scum it well.  Then take it off the fire, and pour it in earthen things to cool: and when  it is cold, put to it five or six spoonfuls of the best yest of Ale you can  get: stir it together, and then every day scum it with a bundle of Feathers  till it hath done working: Then Tun it up in a Sack-cask and to every six  gallons of Metheglin put one pint of _Aquavitae_, or a quart of Sack; and a  quarter of a pound of Ginger sliced, with the Pills of two or three Limons  and Orenges in a bag to hang in it.    The Whites of Eggs above named, is a fit proportion for 10 or 12 Gallons of  the Liquor.      TO MAKE WHITE MEATHE    Take six Gallons of water, and put in six quarts of Honey, stirring it till  the honey be throughly melted; then set it over the fire, and when it is  ready to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16444"],[0,"Indian Unrest (#18)"],[1,", many distinguished members of all these three castes  responded to the call and began to qualify for employment under  Government and for the liberal professions that were opening out in the  new India we were making. They were first in the field, and, though  other castes have followed suit, it is they who have practically  monopolized the public offices, the Bar, the Press, and the teaching  profession. It was they who were the moving spirits of the Brahmo Samaj  and of Social Reform when progressive ideas seemed to be on the point of  permeating Hinduism. But when the reaction came which first found public  expression in the resistance provoked by the Age of Consent Act of 1891  for mitigating the evils of Hindu child marriage, and the spirit of  reform was deflected from the social and religious into the political  domain, it was they again who showed the most aptitude to clothe the new  political movement in all the forms of Western political activities. It  was Mr. W.O. Bonnerjee, an able Bengalee lawyer of moderate and  enlightened views, who presided over the first Indian National Congress  at Bombay and delivered an opening address of which the moderation has  rarely been emulated, and though the Congress movement originated in  Bombay rather than in Bengal, the fluent spokesmen of Bengal very soon  had the satisfaction of feeling that for the first time in Indian  history Bengal might claim to be marching in the van.    Owing to his greater plasticity and imagination, the Bengalee has  certainly often assimilated English ideas as few other Indians have.  None can question, for instance, the genuine Western culture and sound  learning of men like Dr. Ashutosh Mookerjee, the Vice-Chancellor of the  Calcutta University, or Dr. Rash Behari Ghose, than whom the English Bar  itself has produced few greater lawyers; and it would be easy to quote  many other names of scarcely less distinction amongst the many highly  educated Bengalees who have served and are still serving the State with  undoubted loyalty and ability. With the spread of English education,  habits of tolerance have grown up, at any rate as to externals; and  though on the crucial point of inter-marriage caste law has lost hardly  anything of its rigidity, religion, in the ordinary intercourse of life,  seems to sit almost as lightly upon educated Hindu society in Calcutta  as upon English society in London. Another result of English education,  combined with the absence of such traditions of Brahman supremacy as are  still recent and powerful in the Deccan, has been to invest the  political aspirations of the Bengalees with that democratic tinge which  has won the sympathies of English Radicals; and, even if the tinge in  most cases be very slight, the Bengalee's own adaptability enables him  to clothe his opinions with extraordinary skill and verisimilitude in  the form which he intuitively knows will best suit an English audience.  Of any real democratic spirit amongst the educated classes of Bengal it  is difficult to find a trace, for they are separated from the masses  whom they profess to represent by a social gulf which only a few of the  most enlightened amongst them have so far even recognized the necessity  of making some attempt to bridge if they wish to give the slightest  plausibility to their professions. It would be less far-fetched, though  the analogy would still be very halting, to compare the position of the  Bengalee \"moderates\" with that of the middle classes in England before  the Reform Bill of 1832, who had no idea of emancipating the masses, but  only of emancipating themselves to some extent from the control of a  close oligarchy. From this point of view there are undoubtedly, and  especially amongst the elder generation, many educated Bengalees who are  convinced that in claiming by political agitation a larger share in the  administration and government of the country they are merely carrying  into practice the blameless theories of civic life and political  activity which their reading of English history has taught them. Their  influence, however, has been rapidly undermined by a new and essentially  revolutionary school, who combine with a spirit of revolt against all  Western authority a reversion to some of the most reactionary  conceptions of authority that the East has ever produced, and,  unfortunately, it is this new school which has now got hold of the  younger educated classes.    Education, to which in its more primitive forms the Bengalees owed  whatever influence they retained under Mahomedan rule, has given them  under British rule far larger opportunities which they have turned to  account with no mean measure of success. I must reserve the thorny  question of education for separate treatment. All I need say for the  present is that, had it grown less instead of more superficial, had it  been less divorced from discipline and moral training as well as from  the realities of Indian life, the results might have been very  different. As it is, in the form given to it in our Indian schools and  colleges, which have been allowed to drift more and more into native  hands, English education has steadily deteriorated in quality as the  output has increased in quantity. The sacrifices made by many Bengalees  in humble circumstances to procure for their sons the advantages of what  is called higher education are often pathetic, but the results of this  mania for higher education, however laudable in itself, have been  disastrous. Every year large batches of youths with a mere smattering of  knowledge are turned out into a world that has little or no use for  them. Soured on the one hand by their own failure, or by the failure of  such examinations as they may have succeeded in passing to secure for  them the employment to which they aspired, and scorning the sort of work  to which they would otherwise have been trained, they are ripe for every  revolt. That is the material upon which the leaders of unrest have most  successfully worked, and it is only recently that some of the more  sober-minded Bengalees of the older generation have begun to realize the  dangers inherent in such a system. When in 1903 Lord Curzon brought in  his Universities Bill to mitigate some of the most glaring evils of the  system, there was a loud and unanimous outcry in Bengal that Government  intended to throttle higher education because it was education that was  making a \"nation\" of Bengal. Subsequent events have shown that that  measure was not only urgently needed, but that it came too late to cure  the mischief already done, and was, if anything, too circumscribed in  its scope. The storm it raised was intensified shortly afterwards by  Lord Curzon's famous Convocation speech, into which the sensitive and  emotional Bengalee hastened to read a humiliating indictment of the  \"nation.\" Such a storm showed how heavily laden was the atmosphere with  dangerous electricity.    For some years past the influence of Tilak and his irreconcilable school  had been projected from the Deccan into Bengal, and nowhere did it make  itself so rapidly felt as in the Press. The _Calcutta Review_ has been  publishing a very instructive history of the Indian Press by Mr. S.C.  Sanial, a Hindu scholar who has had the advantage of consulting  authentic and hitherto unpublished documents. His erudite work shows how  the native Press of India first grew up in Bengal as the direct product  of English education, and faithfully reflected all the fluctuations of  educated Bengalee opinion, many of the most influential native  newspapers continuing to be published in English, side by side with, and  often under the same control as, more popular papers published in the  vernacular. Among the \"advanced\" journalists of Bengal, none had fallen  so entirely under the spell of Tilak's magnetic personality as Mr. Bepin  Chandra Pal and Mr. Arabindo Ghose, and the former's _New India_ and the  latter's _Bande_ also published in English, soon outstripped the  aggressiveness of Mr. Surendranath Banerjee's _Bengalee_. For though  not immune from the reaction against Western influences and in favour of  Hinduism as a religious and social system, the school represented by Mr.  Banerjee confined itself at first mainly to political agitation and to  criticism of British methods of administration. The new school  represented, perhaps most conspicuously, by Mr. Arabindo Ghose scarcely  disguised its hostility to British rule itself and to all that British  ascendancy stands for. Hinduism for the Hindus, or, as they preferred to  put it, \"Arya for the Aryans,\" was the war-cry of zealots, half  fanatics, half patriots, whose mysticism found in the sacred story of  the _Bhagvat Gita_ not only the charter of Indian independence but the  sanctification of the most violent means for the overthrow of an alien  rule. With this \"Aryan\" reaction, having to a great extent the force of  religious enthusiasm behind it, orthodoxy also recovered ground, and  Brahmanism was not slow to show how potent it still is even in Bengal  when it appeals to the superstitions of the masses. In one form or  another this spirit had spread like wildfire not only among the students  but among the teachers, and the schools of physical training to which  young Bengal had taken, partly under the influence of our British love  of sports and partly from a legitimate desire to remove from their  \"nation\" the stigma of unmanliness, were rapidly transforming themselves  into political societies modelled upon the bands of gymnasts which  figured so prominently in Tilak's propaganda in the Deccan. Among the  older men, some yielded to the new spirit from fear of being elbowed out  by their youngers, some were genuinely impatient of the tardiness of the  constitutional reforms for which they had looked to the agency of the  Indian National Congress; a few perhaps welcomed the opportunity of  venting the"]]]
