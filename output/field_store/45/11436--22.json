One simple plan for  this is to have a small telephone in the torpedo with some loose  buckshot on the diaphragm, which is placed in a horizontal position,  and will be slightly tilted as the torpedo is moved about by the  waves. By connecting the shore end of the cable with a telephone  receiver, the rolling of the shot may be distinctly heard if the  torpedo is floating properly, but if sunk at its moorings, or if the  cable is broken, no sound will be heard.    The use of torpedoes involves the use of both electricity and high  explosives, and a careful study based upon actual experiments has been  carried on for many years, by the engineers and naval officers in all  civilized countries. Some of these experiments have supplied  interesting and useful data, for the use of the agents in question,  for various industrial purposes.    Another form of torpedo is that known as the locomotive torpedo, of  which there are several kinds; some are propelled by liquid carbonic  acid, which is carried in a strong tank and acts through a compact  engine in driving the propeller. One of these is steered by  electricity from the shore, and is known as the Lay-Haight torpedo,  and can run twenty-five miles per hour. The Whitehead torpedo is also  propelled by liquid carbonic acid, but is not steered from shore. Its  depth is regulated by an automatic device actuated by the pressure of  the water. The Howell torpedo is driven by a heavy fly wheel which is  set in rapid rotation just before the torpedo is launched. It has but  a short range and is intended for launching from ships. Another  torpedo is propelled and steered from shore by rapidly pulling out of  it two fine steel wires which, in unwinding, drive the twin screw  propellers. This is the Brennan torpedo. The Sims-Edison torpedo is  both propelled and steered by electricity from the shore, transmitted  to a motor and steering relay in the torpedo by an insulated cable.  This cable has two cores and is paid out by the torpedo as it travels  through the water just as a spider pays out its web. The cable is  about half an inch in diameter and two miles long, and the torpedo can  be driven at about eighteen miles per hour with a current of thirty  amperes and 1,800 volts pressure.    Still another auxiliary weapon of defense is the dynamite gun, or  rather, a pneumatic gun, that throws long projectiles carrying from  250 to 450 pounds of dynamite, to a distance of about two miles. The  shells are arranged to explode soon after striking the water, by an  ingenious battery that ignites the fuse as soon as the salt water  enters it. The gun, which is known as the Zalinski gun, is some sixty  feet long and fifteen inches in caliber, the compressed air being  suddenly admitted to it from the reservoirs at any desired pressure by  a special form of valve that regulates the range. These guns are to be  mounted in deep pits and fired at somewhat higher elevations than  ordinary guns, but it has great accuracy within reasonable limits of  range.      FIELD FORTIFICATIONS.    In field fortification an enormous quantity of work was done during  our last war. Washington, Richmond, Nashville, Petersburg, Norfolk,  New Berne, Plymouth, Vicksburg, and many other cities were elaborately  fortified by field works which involved the handling of vast  quantities of earth, and, where the opposing lines were near together,  ditches, abbatis, ground torpedoes, and wire entanglements were freely  used. In some cases the same ground was fortified in succession by  both armies, so that the total amount of work expended, in this way,  would have built several hundred miles of railway. Around Richmond and  Petersburg alone the development of field works was far greater than  Wellington's celebrated lines at Torres Vedras. In all future wars,  when large armies are opposed to each other, it is probable that field  works will play even a more important part than in the past. The great  advantage of such works, since the introduction of the deadly breech  loading rifles and machine guns, was shown at Plevna, where the  Russians were almost annihilated in attempting to capture the Turkish  intrenchments.      SIEGES.    It is not proposed to go into historical or other details of this  branch of the subject, but to give in a condensed form some account of  siege operations. According to the text books, the first thing to be  done, if possible, in case of a regular siege, is to \"invest\" the  fortress. This is done by surrounding it as quickly as possible with a  continuous line of troops, who speedily intrench themselves and mount  guns bearing outward on all lines of approach to the fortress, to  prevent the enemy from sending in supplies or re-enforcements. As this  line must be at considerable distance from the fort, it is usually  quite long, and so is its name, for it is called the line of  \"Circumvallation.\" Inside of this line is then established a similar  line facing toward the fort, to prevent sorties by the garrison. This  line is called the line of \"Countervallation,\" and should be as close  to the fort as the range of its guns and the nature of the ground will  permit. From this line the troops rush forward at night and open the  trenches, beginning with what is called the first parallel, which  should be so laid out as to envelop those parts of the fort which are  to be made the special objects of attack. From this first parallel a  number of zigzag trenches are started toward the fort and at proper  intervals other parallels, batteries, and magazines are built; this  method of approach being continued until the besieged fort is reached,  or until such batteries can be brought to bear upon it as to breech  the walls and allow the attacking troops to make an assault.    During these operations of course many precautions must be observed,  both by the attacking and defending force, to annoy each other and to  prevent surprise, and the work is mostly carried on under cover of the  earth thrown from the trenches. These operations were supposed to  occupy, under normal conditions, about forty-one days, or rather  nights, as most of the work is done after dark, at the end of which  time the fort should be reduced to such a condition that its  commander, having exhausted all means of defense, would be justified  in considering terms of surrender.    The _Theoretical Journal_ of the siege prescribes just what is to be  done each day by both attack and defense up to the final catastrophe,  and this somewhat discouraging outlook for the defenders was forcibly  illustrated by the late Captain Derby, better known by the reading  public as \"John Phoenix,\" who, when a cadet, was called upon by  Professor Mahan to explain how he would defend a fort, mounting a  certain number of guns and garrisoned by a certain number of men, if  besieged by an army of another assumed strength in men and guns,  replied:    \"I would immediately evacuate the fort and then besiege it and capture  it again in forty-one days.\"    Of course the fallacy of this reasoning was in the fact that the  besieging army is generally supposed to be four or five times as large  as the garrison of the fort; the primary object of forts being to  enable a small force to hold a position, at least for a time, against  a much larger force of the enemy.    Sieges have changed with the development of engines of war, from the  rude and muscular efforts of personal prowess like that described in  Ivanhoe, where the Black Knight cuts his way through the barriers with  his battle axe, to such sieges as those at Vicksburg, Petersburg, and  Plevna, where the individual counted for very little, and the results  depended upon the combined efforts of large numbers of men and  systematic siege operations. It should also be noticed that modern  sieges are not necessarily hampered by the rules laid down in text  books, but vary from them according to circumstances.    For example, many sieges have been carried to successful issues  without completely investing or surrounding the fortress. This was the  case at Petersburg, where General Lee was entirely free to move out,  or receive supplies and re-enforcements up to the very last stages of  the siege. In other cases, as at Fort Pulaski, Sumter, and Macon, the  breeching batteries were established at very much greater distances  than ever before attempted, and the preliminary siege operations were  very much abbreviated and some of them omitted altogether. This is not  an argument against having well defined rules and principles, but it  shows that the engineer must be prepared to cut loose from old rules  and customs whenever the changed state of circumstances requires  different treatment.      MILITARY BRIDGES.    In the movement of armies, especially on long marches in the enemy's  country, one of the greatest difficulties to be overcome is the  crossing of streams, and this is usually done by means of portable  bridges. These may be built of light trestles with adjustable legs to  suit the different depths, or of wooden or canvas boats supporting a  light roadway wide enough for a single line of ordinary wagons or  artillery carriages. The materials for these bridges, which are known  as Ponton Bridges, are loaded upon wagons and accompany the army on  its marches, and when required for use the bridge is rapidly put  together, piece by piece, in accordance with fixed rules, which  constitute, in fact, a regular drill. The wooden boats are quite heavy  and are used for heavy traffic, but for light work, as, for example,  to accompany the rapid movements of the cavalry, boats made of heavy  canvas, stretched upon light wooden frames, that are put together on  the spot, are used.    During Gen. Sherman's memorable Georgia campaign and march to the sea,  over three miles of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15207"],[0,"The New Physics and Its Evolution (#18)"],[1,"a perpendicular pressure exercised on  the surface of a liquid. This leads him to add to the external  pressure, that due to the reciprocal attractions of the gaseous  particles. On the other hand, when we attribute finite dimensions to  these particles, we must give a higher value to the number of shocks  produced in a given time, since the effect of these dimensions is to  diminish the mean path they traverse in the time which elapses between  two consecutive shocks.    The calculation thus pursued leads to our adding to the pressure in  the simple equation a term which is designated the internal pressure,  and which is the quotient of a constant by the square of the volume;  also to our deducting from the volume a constant which is the  quadruple of the total and invariable volume which the gaseous  molecules would occupy did they touch one another.    The experiments fit in fairly well with the formula of Van der Waals,  but considerable discrepancies occur when we extend its limits,  particularly when the pressures throughout a rather wider interval are  considered; so that other and rather more complex formulas, on which  there is no advantage in dwelling, have been proposed, and, in certain  cases, better represent the facts.    But the most remarkable result of M. Van der Waals' calculations is  the discovery of corresponding states. For a long time physicists  spoke of bodies taken in a comparable state. Dalton, for example,  pointed out that liquids have vapour-pressures equal to the  temperatures equally distant from their boiling-point; but that if, in  this particular property, liquids were comparable under these  conditions of temperature, as regards other properties the parallelism  was no longer to be verified. No general rule was found until M. Van  der Waals first enunciated a primary law, viz., that if the pressure,  the volume, and the temperature are estimated by taking as units the  critical quantities, the constants special to each body disappear in  the characteristic equation, which thus becomes the same for all  fluids.    The words corresponding states thus take a perfectly precise  signification. Corresponding states are those for which the numerical  values of the pressure, volume, and temperature, expressed by taking  as units the values corresponding to the critical point, are equal;  and, in corresponding states any two fluids have exactly the same  properties.    M. Natanson, and subsequently P. Curie and M. Meslin, have shown by  various considerations that the same result may be arrived at by  choosing units which correspond to any corresponding states; it has  also been shown that the theorem of corresponding states in no way  implies the exactitude of Van der Waals' formula. In reality, this is  simply due to the fact that the characteristic equation only contains  three constants.    The philosophical importance and the practical interest of the  discovery nevertheless remain considerable. As was to be expected,  numbers of experimenters have sought whether these consequences are  duly verified in reality. M. Amagat, particularly, has made use for  this purpose of a most original and simple method. He remarks that, in  all its generality, the law may be translated thus: If the isothermal  diagrams of two substances be drawn to the same scale, taking as unit  of volume and of pressure the values of the critical constants, the  two diagrams should coincide; that is to say, their superposition  should present the aspect of one diagram appertaining to a single  substance. Further, if we possess the diagrams of two bodies drawn to  any scales and referable to any units whatever, as the changes of  units mean changes in the scale of the axes, we ought to make one of  the diagrams similar to the other by lengthening or shortening it in  the direction of one of the axes. M. Amagat then photographs two  isothermal diagrams, leaving one fixed, but arranging the other so  that it may be free to turn round each axis of the co-ordinates; and  by projecting, by means of a magic lantern, the second on the first,  he arrives in certain cases at an almost complete coincidence.    This mechanical means of proof thus dispenses with laborious  calculations, but its sensibility is unequally distributed over the  different regions of the diagram. M. Raveau has pointed out an equally  simple way of verifying the law, by remarking that if the logarithms  of the pressure and volume are taken as co-ordinates, the co-ordinates  of two corresponding points differ by two constant quantities, and the  corresponding curves are identical.    From these comparisons, and from other important researches, among  which should be particularly mentioned those of Mr S. Young and M.  Mathias, it results that the laws of corresponding states have not,  unfortunately, the degree of generality which we at first attributed  to them, but that they are satisfactory when applied to certain groups  of bodies.[7]    [Footnote 7: Mr Preston thus puts it: \"The law [of corresponding  states] seems to be not quite, but very nearly true for these  substances [_i.e._ the halogen derivatives of benzene]; but in the  case of the other substances examined, the majority of these  generalizations were either only roughly true or altogether departed  from\" (_Theory of Heat_, London, 1904, p. 514.)--ED.]    If in the study of the statics of a simple fluid the experimental  results are already complex, we ought to expect much greater  difficulties when we come to deal with mixtures; still the problem has  been approached, and many points are already cleared up.    Mixed fluids may first of all be regarded as composed of a large  number of invariable particles. In this particularly simple case M.  Van der Waals has established a characteristic equation of the  mixtures which is founded on mechanical considerations. Various  verifications of this formula have been effected, and it has, in  particular, been the object of very important remarks by M. Daniel  Berthelot.    It is interesting to note that thermodynamics seems powerless to  determine this equation, for it does not trouble itself about the  nature of the bodies obedient to its laws; but, on the other hand, it  intervenes to determine the properties of coexisting phases. If we  examine the conditions of equilibrium of a mixture which is not  subjected to external forces, it will be demonstrated that the  distribution must come back to a juxtaposition of homogeneous phases;  in a given volume, matter ought so to arrange itself that the total  sum of free energy has a minimum value. Thus, in order to elucidate  all questions relating to the number and qualities of the phases into  which the substance divides itself, we are led to regard the  geometrical surface which for a given temperature represents the free  energy.    I am unable to enter here into the detail of the questions connected  with the theories of Gibbs, which have been the object of numerous  theoretical studies, and also of a series, ever more and more  abundant, of experimental researches. M. Duhem, in particular, has  published, on the subject, memoirs of the highest importance, and a  great number of experimenters, mostly scholars working in the physical  laboratory of Leyden under the guidance of the Director, Mr Kamerlingh  Onnes, have endeavoured to verify the anticipations of the theory.    We are a little less advanced as regards abnormal substances; that is  to say, those composed of molecules, partly simple and partly complex,  and either dissociated or associated. These cases must naturally be  governed by very complex laws. Recent researches by MM. Van der Waals,  Alexeif, Rothmund, Kuenen, Lehfeld, etc., throw, however, some light on  the question.    The daily more numerous applications of the laws of corresponding  states have rendered highly important the determination of the  critical constants which permit these states to be defined. In the  case of homogeneous bodies the critical elements have a simple, clear,  and precise sense; the critical temperature is that of the single  isothermal line which presents a point of inflexion at a horizontal  tangent; the critical pressure and the critical volume are the two  co-ordinates of this point of inflexion.    The three critical constants may be determined, as Mr S. Young and M.  Amagat have shown, by a direct method based on the consideration of  the saturated states. Results, perhaps more precise, may also be  obtained if one keeps to two constants or even to a single one--  temperature, for example--by employing various special methods. Many  others, MM. Cailletet and Colardeau, M. Young, M.J. Chappuis, etc.,  have proceeded thus.    The case of mixtures is much more complicated. A binary mixture has a  critical space instead of a critical point. This space is comprised  between two extreme temperatures, the lower corresponding to what is  called the folding point, the higher to that which we call the point  of contact of the mixture. Between these two temperatures an  isothermal compression yields a quantity of liquid which increases,  then reaches a maximum, diminishes, and disappears. This is the  phenomenon of retrograde condensation. We may say that the properties  of the critical point of a homogeneous substance are, in a way,  divided, when it is a question of a binary mixture, between the two  points mentioned.    Calculation has enabled M. Van der Waals, by the application of his  kinetic theories, and M. Duhem, by means of thermodynamics, to foresee  most of the results which have since been verified by experiment. All  these facts have been admirably set forth and systematically  co-ordinated by M. Mathias, who, by his own researches, moreover, has  made contributions of the highest value to the study of questions  regarding the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states.    The further knowledge of critical elements has allowed the"]]]
