It's like the rest of me--not a decoration but  for use.\"    \"Afraid of me, Sally?\"    \"Not of a regiment like you.\"    \"Then of my method?\"    \"Go on; I'm game.\"    \"But this is all there is to it.\"    \"What d'you mean?\"    \"Just what I say. Having observed that you haven't set off any of your  advantages, I will sit here and look into your face in silence, which is  as much as to say that no matter how you dress you can't spoil a very  excellent figure, Sally. I suppose you've heard that before?\"    \"Lots of times,\" she muttered.    \"But you wouldn't hear it from me. All I would do would be to sit and  stare and let you imagine what I'm thinking. And you'd begin to see that  in spite of the way you do your hair you can't spoil its colour nor its  texture.\"    He raised his other hand and touched it.    \"Like silk, Sally.\"    He studied her closely, noting the flush which began to touch her  cheeks.    \"Part of the game is for you to keep looking me in the eye.\"    \"Well, I'll be--Go on, I'm game.\"    \"Is it hard to sit like this--silently? Do I do it badly?\"    \"No, you show lots of practice. How many have you tried this method on,  Bard?\"    He made a vague gesture and then, smiling: \"Millions, Sally, and they  all liked it.\"    \"So do I.\"    And they laughed together, and grew serious at the same instant.    \"All silence--like this?\" she queried.    \"No; after a while I would say: 'You are beautiful.'\"    \"You don't get a blue ribbon for that, Bard.\"    \"Not for the words, but the way they're said, which shows I mean them.\"    She blinked as though to clear her eyes and then met his stare again.    \"You know you are beautiful, Sally.\"    \"With a pug nose--freckles--and all that?\"    \"Just a tip-tilt in the nose, Sally. Why, it's charming. And you have  everything else--young, strong, graceful, clear.\"    \"What d'you mean by that?\"    \"Clear? Fresh and colourful like the sunset over the desert. Do you  understand?\"    Her eyes went down to consider.    \"I s'pose I do.\"    \"With a touch of awe in it, because the silence and the night are  coming, and the stars walk down, one by one--one by one. And the wind is  low, soft, musical, whispering, as you do now--What if this were not a  game of suppose, Sally?\"    She wrenched herself suddenly away, rising.    \"I'm tired of supposing!\" she cried.    \"Then we'll call it all real. What of that?\"    That colour was unmistakably high now; it ran down from her cheeks and  even stained the pure white of the throat where the flap of the shirt  was open. He was excited as a hunter who has tracked some new and  dangerous animal and at last driven it to bay, holding his gun poised,  and not knowing whether or not it will prove vulnerable.    He stepped close, eager, prepared for any wild burst of temper; but she  let him take her hands, let him draw her close, bend back her head; hold  her closer still, till the warmth and softness of her body reached him,  but when his lips came close she said quietly: \"Are you a rotter,  Bard?\"    He stiffened and the smile went out on his lips. He stepped back.    She repeated: \"Are you a rotter?\"    He raised the one hand which he still retained and touched it to his  lips.    \"I am very sorry,\" said Anthony, \"will you forgive me?\"    And with her eyes large and grave upon him she answered: \"I wonder if I  can!\"    Butch Conklin looked up, raising his bandaged head slowly, like a white  flag of truce, with a stain of red growing through the cloth. He stared  at the two, raised a hand to his head as though to rub away the dream,  found a pain too real for a dream, and then, like a crab which has grown  almost too old to walk, waddled on hands and knees, slowly, from the  room and melted silently into the dark beyond.          CHAPTER XVIII      FOOLISH HABITS    A sharp noise of running feet leaped from the dust of the street and  clattered through the doorway; the two turned. A swarthy man, broad of  shoulder, was the first, and afterward appeared Nash.    \"Conklin?\" called Deputy Glendin, and swept the room with his startled  glance. \"Where's Conklin?\"    He was not there; only a red stain remained on the floor to show where  he had lain.    \"Where's Conklin?\" called Nash.    \"I'm afraid,\" whispered Bard quickly to the girl, \"that it was more than  a game of suppose.\"    He said easily to the other two: \"He had enough. His share of trouble  came to-night; I let him go.\"    \"Young feller,\" growled Glendin, \"you ain't been in town a long while,  but I've heard a pile too much about you already. What you mean by  takin' the law into your own hands?\"    \"Wait,\" said Nash, his keen eyes on the two, \"I guess I understand.\"    \"Let's have it, then.\"    Still the steady eyes of Nash passed from Sally Fortune to Bard and back  again.    \"This feller bein' a tenderfoot, he don't understand our ways; maybe he  thinks the range is a bit freer than it is.\"    \"That's the trouble,\" answered Glendin, \"he thinks too damned much.\"    \"And does quite a pile besides thinkin',\" murmured Nash, but too low for  the others to hear it.    He hesitated, and then, as if making up his mind by a great effort:  \"There ain't no use blamin' him; better let it drop, Glendin.\"    \"Nothin' else to do, Steve; but it's funny Sally let him do it.\"    \"It is,\" said Nash with emphasis, \"but then women is pretty funny in  lots of ways. Ready to start, Bard?\"    \"All ready.\"    \"S'long, Sally.\"    \"Good-night, Miss Fortune.\"    \"Evenin', boys. We'll be lookin' for you back in Eldara to-morrow night,  Bard.\"    And her eyes fixed with meaning on Nash.    \"Certainly,\" answered the other, \"my business ought not to take longer  than that.\"    \"I'll take him by the shortest cut,\" said Nash, and the two went out to  their horses.    They had difficulty in riding the trail side by side, for though the  roan was somewhat rested by the delay at Eldara it was impossible to  keep him up with Bard's prancing piebald, which sidestepped at every  shadow. Yet the tenderfoot never allowed his mount to pass entirely  ahead of the roan, but kept checking him back hard, turning toward Nash  with an apology each time he surged ahead. It might have been merely  that he did not wish to precede the cowpuncher on a trail which he did  not know. It might have been something quite other than this which made  him consistently keep to the rear; Nash felt certain that the second  possibility was the truth.    In that case his work would be doubly hard. From all that he had seen  the man was dangerous--the image of the tame puma returned to him again  and again. He could not see him plainly through the dark of the night,  but he caught the sway of the body and recognized a perfect  horsemanship, not a Western style of riding, but a good one no matter  where it was learned. He rode as if he were sewed to the back of the  horse, and, as old William Drew had suggested, he probably did other  things up to the same standard. It would have been hard to fulfil his  promise to Drew under any circumstances with such a man as this; but  with Bard apparently forewarned and suspicious the thing became almost  impossible.    Almost, but not entirely so. He set himself calmly to the problem; on  the horn of his saddle the lariat hung loose; if the Easterner should  turn his back for a single instant during all the time they were  together old Drew should not be disappointed, and one thousand cash  would be deposited for the mutual interest of Sally Fortune and himself.  That is to say, if Sally would consent to become interested. To the  silent persuasion of money, however, Nash trusted many things.    The roan jogged sullenly ahead, giving all the strength of his gallant,  ugly body to the work; the piebald mustang pranced like a dancing master  beside and behind with a continual jingling of the tossed bridle.    The masters were to a degree like the horses they rode, for Nash kept  steadily leaning to the front, his bulldog jaw thrusting out; and Bard  was forever shifting in the saddle, settling his hat, humming a tune,  whistling, talking to the piebald, or asking idle questions of the  things they passed, like a boy starting out for a vacation. So they  reached the old house of which Nash had spoken--a mere, shapeless, black  heap huddling through the night.    In the shed to the rear they tied the horses and unsaddled. In the  single room of the shanty, afterward, Nash lighted a candle, which he  produced from his pack, placed it in the centre of the floor, and they  unrolled their blankets on the two bunks which were built against the  wall on either side of the narrow apartment.    Truly it was a crazy shack--such a building as two men, having the  materials at hand, might put together in a single day. It was hardly  based on a foundation, but rather set on the slope side of the hill, and  accordingly had settled down on the lower side toward the door. Not an  old place, but the wind had pried and the rain warped generous cracks  between the boards through which the rising storm whistled and sang and  through which the chill mist of the coming rain cut at them.    Now and then a feeling came to Anthony that the gale might lift the  tottering old shack and roll it on down the hillside to the floor of the  valley, for it rocked and swayed under the breath of the storm. In a way  it was as if the night was giving a loud voice to the silent struggle of  the two men, who continued pleasant, careless with each other.    But when Nash stepped across the room behind Bard, the latter turned and  was busy with the folding of his blankets at the foot of his bunk, his  face toward the cowpuncher and when Bard, slipping off his belt, fumbled  at his holster, Nash was instantly busy with the cleaning of his own  gun.    The cattleman, having removed his boots, his hat, and his belt, was  ready for bed, and slipped his legs under the blankets. He stooped and  picked up his lariat, which lay coiled on the floor beside "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11102"],[0,"History of Negro Soldiers in the Spanish-American War, and Other Items of (#18)"],[1," young men of  the State, who left their peaceful vocations for the rough service of  war, for they were, students, bookkeepers, real estate men, merchants,  clerks and artists who responded to their country's call--all looking  to a much desired promotion. But after many conflicting stories as to  what would be done and much parleying on the part of the recommending  power, who said that there was none in the regiment qualified for the  promotion. And thereupon the Governor appointed white officers to  fill the vacancies created. A copy of the following was sent to the  Governor of Virginia through \"military channels\" but never reached  him; also to the Adjutant General of the army through military  channels:    Sixth Virginia Volunteer Infantry, Second Battalion, Colored, Camp  Poland, Tenn., October 27th, 1898.    To the Adjutant General, U.S. Army, Washington, D.C.    Sir--We, the undersigned officers of the Sixth Virginia Volunteer  Infantry, stationed at Camp Poland, Knoxville, Tenn., have the honor  to respectfully submit to you the following:    Nine officers of this command who had served the state militia for a  period ranging from five to twenty years were ordered examined. They  resigned for reasons best known to themselves. We the remaining  officers were sanguine that Negro officers would be appointed to fill  these vacancies, and believe they can be had from the rank and file,  as the men in the various companies enlisted with the distinct  understanding that they would be commanded by Negro officers. We now  understand through various sources that white officers have been, or  are to be, appointed to fill these vacancies, to which we seriously  and respectfully protest, because our men are dissatisfied. The men  feel that the policy inaugurated as to this command should remain, and  we fear if there is a change it will result disastrously to one of the  best disciplined commands in the volunteer service. They are unwilling  to be commanded by white officers and object to do what they did not  agree to at first. That is to be commanded by any other than officers  of the same color. We furthermore believe that should the appointments  be confirmed there will be a continual friction between the officers  and men of the two races as has been foretold by our present  commanding officer. We express the unanimous and sincere desire of  seven hundred and ninety-one men in the command to be mustered out  rather than submit to the change.    We therefore pray that the existing vacancies be filled from the rank  and file of the command or by men of color. To all of which we most  humbly pray.    (Signed)    J.B. JOHNSON, Major 6th Va.

Second Battalion, Colored, Camp Poland, Tenn., Oct. 28, if  Respectfully forwarded.    I have explained to the officers who signed this paper that their  application is absurd, but they seem unable to see the points  involved.    The statement within that 791 men prefer to be mustered out rather  than serve under white officers is based upon the alleged reports that  each First Sergeant stated to his Captain that all the men of the  company were of that opinion. The statement that the men \"enlisted  with the understanding that they would be commanded entirely by Negro  officers,\" seems to be based upon the fact that when these companies  were called upon by the State authorities they volunteered for  service, etc., \"with our present officers.\" These officers (9 of  them) have since resigned and their places filled by the Governor of  Virginia with white officers.    These latter have not yet reported for duty.    Further comment seems as unnecessary as the application itself is  useless.    (Signed) R.C. CROXTON,    Lt. Col. 6th Va. Vol. Inf.

October 31st, 1898, the monthly muster was in progress. There appeared  in the camp a new Lieutenant--Lieut. Jno. W. Healey--formerly  Sergeant-Major in the regular army. This was the first positive  evidence that white officers would be assigned to this regiment. This  was about 9 o'clock in the morning, and at Knoxville later in the day,  there were more arrivals. Then it was published that the following  changes and appointments were made:    Company \"D,\" First Battalion, was transferred to the Second Battalion;  Company \"F,\" of the Second Battalion, transferred to the First  Battalion. Major E.E. Cobell, commanding Second Battalion. Captain  R.L.E. Masurier, commanding Company \"D.\" Captain W. S. Faulkner,  commanding Company \"E.\" Captain J. W. Bentley, commanding Company \"G.\"  Captain S.T. Moore, commanding Company \"H.\" First Lieutenant Jno. W.  Healey to Company \"H.\" First Lieutenant A.L. Moncure to Company \"G.\"  Second Lieutenant Geo. W. Richardson, Company \"G.\" First Lieutenant  Edwin T. Walker transferred to Company \"C.\" November 1st officers  attempted to take charge of the men who offered no violence at all,  but by their manner and conduct it appeared too unpleasant and unsafe  for these officers to remain, so tendered their resignations, but they  were withheld for a day.    The next day, November 2, 1898, it was thought best that the colored  Captains and Lieutenants would drill the companies at the 9 o'clock  drill. While on the field \"recall\" was sounded and the companies were  brought to the headquarters and formed a street column. General Bates,  commanding the Corps and his staff; Col. Kuert, commanding the Brigade  and Brigade staff; Maj. Louis V. Caziarc, Assistant Adjutant-General:  Lieut. Col. Croxton and Maj. Johnson were all there and spoke to the  men. Colonel Kuert said: \"Gentlemen, as commanding officer of the  Brigade, I appear before you to-day asking you to do your duty; to be  good soldiers, to remember your oath of enlistment, and to be careful  as to the step you take, for it might cost you your life; that there  are enough soldiers at my command to force you into submission should  you resist. No, if you intend to accept the situation and submit to  these officers placed over you, at my command, you come to a right  shoulder, and if you have any grievance imaginary or otherwise  present through proper military channels, and if they are proper, your  wrongs will be adjusted.\"    \"Right shoulder, Arms.\" Did not a man move. He then ordered them to be  taken back to their company street and to \"stack arms.\"    Before going to the company streets Major Caziarc spoke to the men as  follows: \"Forty years ago no Negro could bear arms or wear the blue.  You cannot disgrace the blue, but can make yourselves unworthy to wear  it.\"    Then Maj. J.B. Johnson spoke to the men and urged upon them to keep  in mind the oath of enlistment (which he read to them), in which they  swore that they would \"obey all officers placed over them;\" that since  the appointments had been made there was nothing for them to do but to  accept the situation. At the conclusion of Maj. Johnson's talk to the  men, Private Badger, Regimental Tailor, stepped to the front and gave  the \"rifle salute\" and asked permission to say a word. It was granted.  He said: \"When we enlisted we understood that we would go with  our colored officers anywhere in or out of this country, and when  vacancies occurred we expected and looked for promotion as was the  policy of the Governor of Virginia toward other Virginia Regiments.\"  He was told that if the men had any grievance they could present it  through military channels and it would be looked into. They never  accepted Maj. Johnson's advice--returned to their company streets and  were allowed to keep their guns. The Ordnance Officer was ordered to  take all ammunition to the camp of the Thirty-first Michigan and place  it in the guard-house.    The men had the freedom and pass privilege to and from the city.    [Illustration: MAJOR J.B.
