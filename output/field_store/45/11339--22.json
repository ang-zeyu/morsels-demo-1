It now became the task of the District Attorney to induce Miller to  confess the truth and take the stand against Ammon. He had been in  prison a considerable time and his health was such as to necessitate his  being transferred to the hospital ward. Several of the District  Attorney's assistants visited him at various times at Sing Sing in the  hope of being able to persuade him to turn State's evidence, but all  their efforts were in vain. Miller refused absolutely to say anything  that would tend to implicate Ammon.    At last the District Attorney himself, accompanied by Mr. Nott, who  later prosecuted Ammon, made a special trip to Sing Sing to see what  could be done. They found Miller lying upon his prison pallet, his harsh  cough and blazing eyes speaking only too patently of his condition. At  first Mr. Nott tried to engage him in conversation while the District  Attorney occupied himself with other business in another part of the  ward, but it was easily apparent that Miller would say nothing. The  District Attorney then approached the bed where Miller was lying and  inquired if it were true that he declined to say anything which might  tend to incriminate Ammon. After some hesitation Miller replied that,  even if he should testify against his old accomplice, there was nothing  to show that he would be pardoned, and that he would not talk unless he  had actually in his hands some paper or writing which would guarantee  that if he did so he would be set free.    The spectacle of a convicted felon haggling with an officer of the law  over the terms upon which he would consent to avail himself of an  opportunity to make the only reparation still possible angered the  District Attorney, and, turning fiercely upon the prisoner, he arraigned  him in scathing terms, stating that he was a miserable swindler and  thief, who had robbed thousands of poor people of all the money they had  in the world, that he showed himself devoid of every spark of decency or  repentance by refusing to assist the law in punishing his confederate  and assisting his victims in getting back what was left of the money,  and that he, the District Attorney, felt himself humiliated in having  consented to come there to visit and talk with such a heartless and  depraved specimen of humanity. The District Attorney then turned his  back upon Miller, whose eyes filled with tears, but who made no  response.    A few moments later the convict asked permission to speak to the  District Attorney alone. With some reluctance the latter granted the  request and the others drew away.    \"Mr. District Attorney,\" said the wretched man in a trembling voice,  with the tears still suffusing his eyes, \"I _am_ a thief; I did rob all  those poor people, and I am heartily sorry for it. I would gladly die,  if by doing so I could pay them back. But I haven't a single cent of all  the money that I stole and the only thing that stands between my wife  and baby and starvation is my keeping silence. If I did what you ask,  the only money they have to live on would be stopped. I can't see them  starve, glad as I would be to do what I can now to make up for the wrong  I have done.\"    The District Attorney's own eyes were not entirely dry as he held out  his hand to Miller.    \"Miller,\" he replied, \"I have done you a great injustice. I honor you  for the position you have taken. Were I in your place I should probably  act exactly as you are doing. I cannot promise you a pardon if you  testify against Ammon. I cannot even promise that your wife will receive  forty dollars a month, for the money in my charge cannot be used for  such a purpose; all I can assure you of is that, should you decide to  help me, a full and fair statement of all you may have done will be sent  to the Governor with a request that he act favorably upon any  application for a pardon which you may make. The choice must be your  own. Whatever you decide to do, you have my respect and sympathy. Think  well over the matter. Do not decide at once; wait for a day or two, and  I will return to New York and you can send me word.\"    The next day Miller sent word that he had determined to tell the truth  and take the stand, whatever the consequences to himself and his family  might be. He was immediately transferred to the Tombs Prison in New York  City, where he made a complete and full confession, not only assisting  in every way in securing evidence for the prosecution of Ammon, but  aiding his trustee in bankruptcy to determine the whereabouts of some  sixty thousand dollars of the stolen money, which but for him would  never have been recovered. At the same time Ammon was re-arrested upon a  bench warrant, and his bail sufficiently increased to render his  appearance for trial probable. As Miller had foreseen, the monthly  payment to his wife instantly stopped.    The usual effect produced upon a jury by the testimony of a convict  accomplice is one of distrust or open incredulity. Every word of  Miller's story, however, carried with it the impression of absolute  truth. As he proceeded, in spite of the sneers of the defence, an  extraordinary wave of sympathy for the man swept over the court-room,  and the jury listened with close attention to his graphic account of the  rise and fall of the outrageous conspiracy which had attempted to shield  its alluring offer of instant wealth behind the name of America's most  practical philosopher, whose only receipt for the same end had been  frugality and industry. Supported as Miller was by the corroborative  testimony of other witnesses and by the certificates of deposit which  Ammon had, with his customary bravado, made out in his own handwriting,  no room was left for even the slightest doubt, not only that the money  had been stolen but that Ammon had received it. Indeed so plain was the  proposition that the defence never for an instant contemplated the  possibility of putting Ammon upon the stand in his own behalf. It was in  truth an extraordinary case, for the principal element in the proof was  made out by the evidence of the thief himself that he was a thief.  Miller had been tried and convicted of the very larceny to which he now  testified, and, although in the eyes of the law no principle of _res  adjudicata_ could apply in Ammon's case, it was a logical conclusion  that if the evidence upon the first trial was repeated, the necessary  element of larceny would be effectually established. Hence, in point of  fact, Miller's testimony upon the question of whether the money had been  _stolen_ was entirely unnecessary, and the efforts of the defence were  directed simply to making out Miller such a miscreant upon his own  testimony that perforce the jury could not accept his evidence when it  reached the point of implicating Ammon. All their attempts in this  direction, however, only roused increased sympathy for the witness and  hostility toward their own client, and made the jury the more ready to  believe that Ammon had been the only one in the end to profit by the  transaction.    Briefly, the two points urged by the defence were:    (1) That Ammon was acting only as Miller's counsel, and hence was  immune, and,    (2) That there was no adequate legal evidence that the thirty thousand  five hundred dollars which Ammon had deposited, as shown by the deposit  slip, was the identical money stolen from the victims of the Franklin  syndicate. As bearing upon this they urged that the stolen money had in  fact been deposited by Miller himself, and so had lost the character of  stolen money before it was turned over to the defendant, and that  Miller's story being that of an accomplice required absolute  corroboration in every detail.    The point that Ammon was acting only as a lawyer was quickly disposed of  by Judge Newburger.    \"Something has been said by counsel,\" he remarked in his charge to the  jury, \"to the effect that the defendant, as a lawyer, had a perfect  right to advise Miller, but I know of no rule of law that will permit  counsel to advise how a crime can be committed.\"    As to the identity of the money, the Court charged that it made no  difference which person performed the physical act of placing the cash  in the hands of the receiving teller of the bank, so long as it was  deposited to Ammon's credit.    On the question of what corroboration of Miller's story was necessary,  Judge Ingraham, in the Appellate Division, expressed great doubt as to  whether in the eyes of the law Miller, the thief, could be regarded as  an accomplice of Ammon in receiving the stolen money at all, and stated  that even if he could be so regarded, there was more than abundant  corroboration of his testimony.    Ammon's conviction was affirmed throughout the courts, including the  Court of Appeals, and the defendant himself is now engaged in serving  out his necessarily inadequate sentence--necessarily inadequate, since  under the laws of the State of New York, the receiver of stolen goods,  however great his moral obliquity may be, and however great the amount  stolen, can only receive half the punishment which may be meted out to  the thief himself, \"receiving\" being punishable by only five years or  less in State's prison, while grand larceny is punishable by ten years.    Yet who was the greater criminal--the weak, ignorant, poverty-stricken  clerk, or the shrewd, experienced lawyer who preyed upon his client and  through him upon the community at large?    The confession of Miller, in the face of what the consequences of his  course might mean to his wife and child, was an act of moral courage.  The price he had to pay is known to himself alone. But the horrors of  life in prison for the \"squealer\" were thoroughly familiar to him when  he elected to do what he could to atone for his crime. In fact Ammon had  not neglected to picture them vividly to him and to stigmatize an  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1319"],[0,"Increasing Human Efficiency in Business (#18)"],[1,"records. This fact, coupled  with the observation that the spirit of his  working force seemed to change with the  change of temperature from warm to cold,  helped him to arrive at the right solution.    He made the discovery sitting in the draught  of an electric fan. He looked up, made a  mental note; and next morning he moved his  office ``comforter'' out to the head of one file of  machines. The draught tangled the goods  under the seamstresses' hands at times, but  the half dozen girls within range showed a  decided increase in production over the day  before and over operators at other tables.    He had found his remedy for the summer  slump. Within a week he had installed a  system of large overhead fans and an exhaust  <p 167>  blower and saw his production figures mount  to the winter's best average. From careless,  indifferent workers, on edge at trifles and difficult  to hold, his force developed steadiness  and efficiency. Not only was the output  increased twenty per cent over previous  summers, but the proportion of spoiled work  was considerably reduced.    One of the women who had been a subject  of the first day's experiment struck close to  the reason of her greater efficiency in her  off-hand answer to his inquiry.    ``It was a pleasure to work to-day. It was  so comfortable after yesterday you just forgot  the other girls, forgot you wanted to rest,  forgot everything but the seams you were  running and the fact that it was a big day.  I'm not near so tired as usual either.''    _A successful day is likely to be a restful one,  an unsuccessful day an exhausting one. The  man who is greatly interested in his work and  who finds delight in overcoming the difficulties  of his calling is not likely to become so tired as  the man for whom the work is a burden_.  <p 168>    The experience related summarizes the  experience of every worker who has studied,  either on his own initiative or at some other's  instance, the effect upon output secured by  the removal of distressing or displeasing conditions  from the workroom.    The man who has been engaged in intellectual  or manual labor finds himself more or less  exhausted when the day's work is done. The  degree of exhaustion varies greatly from day  to day and is not in direct proportion to the  amount of energy expended or the results  attained. A comparatively busy day may  leave him feeling fresh, while at the end of a  day much less occupied he may be utterly  ``dragged out'' and weary.    Some men habitually find themselves fatigued,  while others ordinarily end the day  with a feeling of vigor. These contrary  effects are not necessarily due primarily  to disparity in the amount of energy spent  or to unequal stores of energy available.  The discrepancy in many instances is due to  diverse attitudes toward the work or varying  <p 169>  degrees of success which has attended the  work.    Pleasure secured in and from work is the  best preventive and balm for tired muscles  and jaded brains. Dislike or discomfort, on  the other hand, adds to toil by sapping the  strength of the worker.    Victory in intercollegiate athletic events  depends on will power and physical endurance.  This is particularly apparent in football.  Frequently it is not the team with the  greater muscular development or speed of  foot that wins the victory, but the one with the  more grit and perseverance. At the conclusion  of a game players are often unable to walk from  the field and need to be carried. Occasionally  the winning team has actually worked the  harder and received the more serious injuries.  Regardless of this fact, it is usually  true that the victorious team leaves the  field less jaded than the conquered team.  Furthermore the winners will report next day  refreshed and ready for further training,  while the losers may require several days to  <p 170>  overcome the shock and exhaustion of their  defeat.    Recently I had a very hard contest at tennis.  Some hours after the game I was still too tired  to do effective work. I wondered why, until  I remembered that I had been thoroughly  beaten, and that, too, by an opponent whom I  felt I outclassed. I had been in the habit of  playing even harder contests and ordinarily  with no discomfort--especially when successful  in winning the match.    What I have found so apparent in physical  exertion is equally true in intellectual labor.  Writing or research work which progresses  satisfactorily leaves me relatively fresh;  unsuccessful efforts bring their aftermath of  weariness.    _Intellectual work which is pleasant is stimulating  and does not fag one, while intellectual  work which is uninteresting or displeasing is  depressing and exhausting_.    We can readily trace the source of energy  in mechanical devices. The hands of a clock  continue in their course because of the energy  <p 171>  locked up in a compressed spring or elevated  weight. The gun projects the bullet because  of the sudden chemical union of carbon with  saltpeter and sulphur. The steam engine  takes its energy from the steam secured by  combustion of coal or other fuel.    The work of the human organism is usually  classified as muscular or intellectual. In  either the expenditure of energy is as dependent  upon known causes as is the activity  of the mechanical devices mentioned  above.    Every muscular activity is dependent upon  muscular cells ready for combustion; without  such combustion no muscular work is  performed.    Every intellectual process is likewise dependent  upon brain cells ready for combustion,  and no intellectual work can be performed  without combustion of these brain cells.    To secure continued activity the clock must  be rewound, the gun must be recharged, more  coal must be supplied to the engine. In like  manner the continuation of muscular and in-  <p 172>  tellectual activity depends upon the restoration  of muscle and brain cells. The necessity  for renewal is greater or less according to the  amount stored in reserve and the rapidity of  consumption. A maximum head of steam  may keep the engine running for a long time  unless the load is too heavy or the speed too  great. Though under certain conditions the  amount of muscle and brain energy stored in  reserve is large, continuous or rapid activity of  necessity expends the reserve and leads to  exhaustion.    It is a simple process to rewind the clock,  to reload the gun, and to replenish the fuel.  To restore muscular and nerve cells is a very  delicate process. So wonderful is the human  organism, however, that the process is carried  on perfectly without our consciousness or  volition except under abnormal conditions.    Food and air are the first essentials of this  restoration. Indirectly the perfect working of  all the bodily organs contribute to the process  --especially deepened breathing, heightened  pulse, and increase of bodily volume due  <p 173>  to the expansion of the blood vessels running  just beneath the skin.    _Here pleasure enters. Its effect on the expenditure  of energy is to make muscle and brain  cells more available for consumption, and particularly  to hasten the process of restoration or  recuperation_.    The deepened breathing supplies more air  for the oxidation of body wastes. The heightened  pulse carries nourishment more rapidly  to the depleted tissues and relieves the tissues  more rapidly from the poisonous wastes  produced by work. The body, the machine,  runs more smoothly, and fewer stops for repairs  are made necessary.    In addition to these specific functions,  pleasure hastens all the bodily processes which  are of advantage to the organism. The hastening  may be so great that recuperation keeps  pace with the consumption consequent on  efficient labor, with the result that there is  little or no exhaustion. This is in physiological  terms the reason why a person can do more  when he ``enjoys'' his work or play, and can  <p 174>  continue his efforts for a longer period without  fatigue. The man who enjoys his work requires  less time for recreation and exercise, for  his enjoyment recharges the storage battery of  energy.    Not only can I endure more and achieve  more when I take pleasure in the task, but I  can also secure better results from others by  providing for their interest and for their pleasure  in what they are doing. This is a fact  which wise merchants and employers have  felt intuitively, but in most instances the  principle has not been consciously formulated.  High-grade stores do much to add to the pleasure  of their customers. Every resource of art  and architecture is employed to make store  rooms appeal to the <ae>sthetic sense and the  appreciation of customers. Clerks are instructed  to be obliging and courteous. Employees  are not allowed to dress in a style  likely to offend a customer and they are  schooled in manners and in speech. Space  is devoted to the convenience and comfort  of customers.  <p 175>    _The most successful establishments in the  world are the ones which do most to please their  patrons--not by cutting prices or simply by  supplying better goods, but by expediting and  making more pleasant the purchase of goods_.    They have discovered that customers inducted  into a beautiful shop and surrounded  by tactful obliging clerks are more willing to  buy and are more likely to be satisfied with  what they purchase. By adding to their patrons'  comfort and pleasure they are able to  accomplish more than by any other selling  argument. In like manner, restaurants and  hotels have learned that splendid rooms, flowers,  spotless linen, well-dressed and courteous  waiters, good furniture, and so on, all attract  customers and induce them to order more  generously.    Lawyers find in trying cases that it is quite  essential to regard the mood of clients, juries,  and judges. The pleased man is not suspicious;  he does not hesitate in coming to a conclusion,"]]]
