So let  the remainder of the furniture keep still while the shoes do their best.  Let us call to mind a classic fairy-tale involving shoes that are  magical: The Seven Leagued Boots, for example, or The Enchanted  Moccasins, or the footwear of Puss in Boots. How gorgeous and embroidered  any of these should be, and at a crisis what sly antics they should be  brought to play, without fidgeting all over the shop! Cinderella's  Slipper is not sufficiently the heroine in moving pictures of that story.  It should be the tiny leading lady of the piece, in the same sense the  mighty steam-engine is the hero of the story in chapter two. The peasants  when they used to tell the tale by the hearth fire said the shoe was made  of glass. This was in mediaeval Europe, at a time when glass was much more  of a rarity. The material was chosen to imply a sort of jewelled  strangeness from the start. When Cinderella loses it in her haste, it  should flee at once like a white mouse, to hide under the sofa. It should  be pictured there with special artifice, so that the sensuous little foot  of every girl-child in the audience will tingle to wear it. It should  move a bit when the prince comes frantically hunting his lady, and peep  out just in time for that royal personage to spy it. Even at the  coronation it should be the centre of the ritual, more gazed at than the  crown, and on as dazzling a cushion. The final taking on of the slipper  by the lady should be as stately a ceremony as the putting of the circlet  of gold on her aureole hair. So much for Cinderella. But there are novel  stories that should be evolved by preference, about new sorts of magic  shoes.    We have not exhausted Moving Day. The chairs kept still through the  Cinderella discourse. Now let them take their innings. Instead of having  all of them dance about, invest but one with an inner life. Let its  special attributes show themselves but gradually, reaching their climax  at the highest point of excitement in the reel, and being an integral  part of that enthusiasm. Perhaps, though we be inventing a new  fairy-tale, it will resemble the Siege Perilous in the Arthurian story,  the chair where none but the perfect knight could sit. A dim row of  flaming swords might surround it. When the soul entitled to use this  throne appears, the swords might fade away and the gray cover hanging in  slack folds roll back because of an inner energy and the chair might turn  from gray to white, and with a subtle change of line become a throne.    The photoplay imagination which is able to impart vital individuality to  furniture will not stop there. Let the buildings emanate conscious life.  The author-producer-photographer, or one or all three, will make into a  personality some place akin to the House of the Seven Gables till the  ancient building dominates the fancy as it does in Hawthorne's tale.  There are various ways to bring about this result: by having its outlines  waver in the twilight, by touches of phosphorescence, or by the passing  of inexplicable shadows or the like. It depends upon what might be called  the genius of the building. There is the Poe story of The Fall of the  House of Usher, where with the death of the last heir the castle falls  crumbling into the tarn. There are other possible tales on such terms,  never yet imagined, to be born to-morrow. Great structures may become in  sort villains, as in the old Bible narrative of the origin of the various  languages. The producer can show the impious Babel Tower, going higher  and higher into the sky, fascinating and tempting the architects till a  confusion of tongues turns those masons into quarrelling mobs that become  departing caravans, leaving her blasted and forsaken, a symbol of every  Babylon that rose after her.    There are fables where the rocks and the mountains speak. Emerson has  given us one where the Mountain and the Squirrel had a quarrel. The  Mountain called the Squirrel \"Little Prig.\" And then continues a clash of  personalities more possible to illustrate than at first appears. Here we  come to the second stage of the fairy-tale where the creature seems so  unmanageable in his physical aspect that some actor must be substituted  who will embody the essence of him. To properly illustrate the quarrel of  the Mountain and the Squirrel, the steep height should quiver and heave  and then give forth its personality in the figure of a vague smoky giant,  capable of human argument, but with oak-roots in his hair, and Bun,  perhaps, become a jester in squirrel's dress.    Or it may be our subject matter is a tall Dutch clock. Father Time  himself might emerge therefrom. Or supposing it is a chapel, in a  knight's adventure. An angel should step from the carving by the door: a  design that is half angel, half flower. But let the clock first tremble a  bit. Let the carving stir a little, and then let the spirit come forth,  that there may be a fine relation between the impersonator and the thing  represented. A statue too often takes on life by having the actor  abruptly substituted. The actor cannot logically take on more personality  than the statue has. He can only give that personality expression in a  new channel. In the realm of letters, a real transformation scene,  rendered credible to the higher fancy by its slow cumulative movement, is  the tale of the change of the dying Rowena to the living triumphant  Ligeia in Poe's story of that name. Substitution is not the fairy-story.  It is transformation, transfiguration, that is the fairy-story, be it a  divine or a diabolical change. There is never more than one witch in a  forest, one Siege Perilous at any Round Table. But she is indeed a witch  and the other is surely a Siege Perilous.    We might define Fairy Splendor as furniture transfigured, for without  transfiguration there is no spiritual motion of any kind. But the phrase  \"furniture-in-motion\" serves a purpose. It gets us back to the earth for  a reason. Furniture is architecture, and the fairy-tale picture should  certainly be drawn with architectural lines. The normal fairy-tale is a  sort of tiny informal child's religion, the baby's secular temple, and it  should have for the most part that touch of delicate sublimity that we  see in the mountain chapel or grotto, or fancy in the dwellings of  Aucassin and Nicolette. When such lines are drawn by the truly  sophisticated producer, there lies in them the secret of a more than  ritualistic power. Good fairy architecture amounts to an incantation in  itself.    If it is a grown-up legend, it must be more than monumental in its lines,  like the great stone face of Hawthorne's tale. Even a chair can reach  this estate. For instance, let it be the throne of Wodin, illustrating  some passage in Norse mythology. If this throne has a language, it speaks  with the lightning; if it shakes with its threat, it moves the entire  mountain range beneath it. Let the wizard-author-producer climb up from  the tricks of Moving Day to the foot-hills where he can see this throne  against the sky, as a superarchitect would draw it. But even if he can  give this vision in the films, his task will not be worth while if he is  simply a teller of old stories. Let us have magic shoes about which are  more golden dreams than those concerning Cinderella. Let us have stranger  castles than that of Usher, more dazzling chairs than the Siege Perilous.  Let us have the throne of Liberty, not the throne of Wodin.    There is one outstanding photoplay that I always have in mind when I  think of film magic. It illustrates some principles of this chapter and  chapter four, as well as many others through the book. It is Griffith's  production of The Avenging Conscience. It is also an example of that rare  thing, a use of old material that is so inspired that it has the dignity  of a new creation. The raw stuff of the plot is pieced together from the  story of The Tell-tale Heart and the poem Annabel Lee. It has behind it,  in the further distance, Poe's conscience stories of The Black Cat, and  William Wilson. I will describe the film here at length, and apply it to  whatever chapters it illustrates.    An austere and cranky bachelor (well impersonated by Spottiswoode Aitken)  brings up his orphan nephew with an awkward affection. The nephew is  impersonated by Henry B. Walthall. The uncle has an ambition that the boy  will become a man of letters. In his attempts at literature the youth is  influenced by Poe. This brings about the Poe quality of his dreams at the  crisis. The uncle is silently exasperated when he sees his boy's  writing-time broken into, and wasted, as he thinks, by an affair with a  lovely Annabel (Blanche Sweet). The intimacy and confidence of the lovers  has progressed so far that it is a natural thing for the artless girl to  cross the gardens and after hesitation knock at the door. She wants to  know what has delayed her boy. She is all in a flutter on account of the  overdue appointment to go to a party together. The scene of the pretty  hesitancy on the step, her knocking, and the final impatient tapping with  her foot is one of the best illustrations of the intimate mood in  photoplay episodes. On the girl's entrance the uncle overwhelms her and  the boy by saying she is pursuing his nephew like a common woman of the  town. The words actually burst through the film, not as a melodramatic,  but as an actual insult. This is a thing almost impossible to do in the  photoplay. This outrage in the midst of an atmosphere of chivalry is one  of Griffith's master-moments. It accounts for the volcanic fury of the  nephew that takes such trouble to burn itself out afterwards. It is not  easy for the young to learn that they must let those people flay them for  an hour who have made every sacrifice for them through a life-time.

Dost thou grudge    The king his bride? Or hast thou lamed thy tongue    In battle? That was never known before.    But no, for thou could'st use it fast enough    To tell me of Brunhilda's dark brown eyes    And raven tresses.      SIEGFRIED.      Prithee, say not so!      GISELHER.      How hotly he denies it! See him raise    On high three fingers, swearing that he loves    Blue eyes--light hair!      UTE.      This is an arrant rogue!    He is nor boy nor man, sapling nor tree.    And long hath he outgrown his mother's rod,    Nor ever hath he felt his father's whip.    Ungoverned is he as a yearling colt,    That's never known the bridle or the whip.    We must forgive or punish him!      SIEGFRIED.      'Twere not    So easy as you think! To break a colt    Is difficult, and many limp away    Ashamed, and cannot mount him!      UTE.      Then once more    He 'scapes his punishment!      GISELHER.      As a reward,    I'll tell a secret to thee.      KRIEMHILD.      Giselher!      GISELHER.      What hast thou to conceal? Be not afraid!    I do not know thy secret, nor will blow    The ashes from thy embers.--Never fear!      UTE.      What is it then?      GISELHER.      I have myself forgotten.    When a man's sister blushes rosy-red,    'Tis natural a brother is surprised    And seeks to know the reason.--Never mind!    The secret I'll recall before I die,    And then shall Siegfried learn it.      SIEGFRIED.      Thou may'st jeer,    For I forget my message utterly,    And ere I've given word that you should don    Your festal garments, do the trumpets blow,    And Gunther and his train bring in the bride!      GISELHER.      Dost thou not see the steward hastening?    Thy very coming told enough to him!    But I will help!      [_He goes to_ RUMOLT.]      KRIEMHILD.      A noble messenger    May not be paid with gifts!      SIEGFRIED.      Indeed he may!      KRIEMHILD (_fastens her bracelet and in so doing drops her    handkerchief)_.      SIEGFRIED (_snatches at the handkerchief)_.      This is my gift.      KRIEMHILD.      Pray, no! 'Twere all unworthy!      SIEGFRIED.      Jewels I value as another, dust.    And houses can I build of gold and silver,    Yet lack I such a kerchief!      KRIEMHILD.      Take it then!    It is my handiwork.      SIEGFRIED.      And thy free gift?      KRIEMHILD.      My noble Siegfried, yes, 'tis my free gift.      UTE.      I crave thy pardon--it is time to go!      [_Exit, with_ KRIEMHILD.]          SCENE IV      SIEGFRIED.      A Roland[2] would have stood as stood I here!    I wonder that the sparrows did not nest    Within my hair.          SCENE V      _Enter the_ CHAPLAIN.      CHAPLAIN (_advances_).      Your pardon, noble sir,    Has Brunhild been baptized?      SIEGFRIED.      She is baptized.      CHAPLAIN.      Then 'tis a Christian land from which she    comes?      SIEGFRIED.      They fear the cross.      CHAPLAIN (_steps back again_).      Perchance 'tis there as here!    Where men will place it next to Wotan's tree    Right gladly, for they do not surely know    If magic may not dwell there; as we see    Devoutest Christians hesitate to break    A heathen image, for some remnant still    Awakes within them of the olden fear    Before those staring eyes.        SCENE VI      _Flourish of trumpets_. BRUNHILDA, FRIGGA, GUNTHER, HAGEN, VOLKER,    _retainers_, KRIEMHILD _and_ UTE _approach them from the castle_.      GUNTHER.      And here's the castle!    My mother's coming now to welcome thee,    Kriemhilda too.      VOLKER (_to BRUNHILDA, _as the women approach each other_).      Are they no gain to thee?      HAGEN.      Siegfried, a word! Thy trick availed us naught.      SIEGFRIED.      Availed us naught? Was she not vanquished then?    Is she not here?      HAGEN.      What profit is in that?      SIEGFRIED.      Why, all!      HAGEN.      But nay! Who cannot take by force    Her first caress will master nevermore    This maid, and Gunther is not strong enough.      SIEGFRIED.      And has he tried?      HAGEN.      Why else should I complain?    In full sight of the castle! She at first    Resisted him, as it befits a maid,    And as our mothers may have done of old;    But when she saw that but the lightest touch    Sufficed to drive the ardent wooer forth,    She grew enraged, and, when he tarried still,    She seized and held him with her outstretched arm    Above the Rhine. A shame it was to him,    A shame to all of us.      SIEGFRIED.      She is a witch!      HAGEN.      Chide not, but help!      SIEGFRIED.      I think that if the priest    But married them--      HAGEN.      Were that old hag not there,    The woman that attends her! All day long    She spies and questions, and she sits by her    As the embodiment of wise old age.    I fear the nurse the most.      UTE (_to_ KRIEMHILD _and_ BRUNHILDA).      Now love each other,    And may the circlet that your arms have twined    In this first joyful moment widen out    Further and further to a perfect ring    Within which you may wander, side by side,    Sharing your joys in harmony complete!    Yours is a privilege that I had not,    For what I might not say unto my lord    I had to bear in silence; but at least    I could not speak complainingly of him.      KRIEMHILD.      Let us be like two sisters.      BRUNHILDA.      For your sake    Your son and brother may imprint the seal    Upon my lips that stamps me as his maid    Before the nightfall comes, for I am still    Unblemished and untouched like some young tree,    And were it not for your sweet gentleness    Forever would I hold this shame afar.      UTE.      Thou speak'st of shame?      BRUNHILDA.      Forgive me for that word;    I speak but as I feel. And I am strange    Here in your world, and as my rugged land    Would surely terrify you, were you there,    So does your land alarm me, for I feel    That here I could not have been born at all--Yet    must I live here!--Is the sky so blue    Forever?      KRIEMHILD.      Nearly all the time 'tis blue.      BRUNHILDA.      We know not blue, unless we see blue eyes,    And those we only have with ruddy hair    And milk-white faces! Is it always still,    And does the wind blow never?      KRIEMHILD.      Sometimes storms    O'erwhelm the land, and then the day is night    With thunderpeals and lightning.      BRUNHILDA.      Would it come    Today!--'Twould be a greeting from my home!    I cannot well endure the brilliant light;    It pains me and it makes me feel so bare,    As if no garment here were thick enough!    And are those flowers--red and gold and green?      KRIEMHILD. Thou ne'er hast seen them, yet thou know'st their hues?      BRUNHILDA. Of precious stones there is with us no lack--    Though never white or black ones; yet my hands    Have taught me white, and raven is my hair.      KRIEMHILD. Thou canst not know of fragrance!      [_She plucks a violet for her_.]      BRUNHILDA.      Oh how sweet!    And is't that tiny flower that breathes it forth--    The only one my eye did not observe?    I'd love to give the flower a pretty name--    But surely it is named.      KRIEMHILD.      The little flower    Is lowlier than all, and none thy foot    More easily had crushed, for it appears    To be ashamed that it is more than grass,    And so it hides its head; but yet it drew    A gentle word from thee, the first we've heard.    So let it be a token that within    Our land is much that's hidden from thy gaze    That will delight thee.      BRUNHILDA.      That I hope indeed--    For I need joy! Thou know'st not what it is    To be a woman, yet to overcome    A man in every combat and to gain    His strength that ebbs away as flows his blood,    And from the steaming blood breathe in new force--    To feel yourself grow stronger, braver yet,    And then, when victory is surer still--      [_Turning suddenly_]      Frigga, I ask again! What did I see--    Before that latest contest, what said I?      FRIGGA.      It seemed thy spirit must have seen this land.      BRUNHILDA.      This land!      FRIGGA.      Thou didst rejoice.      BRUNHILDA.      And I rejoiced!--    Thine eyes, however, flamed.      FRIGGA.      Because I saw    Thy happiness.      BRUNHILDA.      These warriors looked to me    As white as snow.      FRIGGA.      They had been ever so.      BRUNHILDA.      Wherefore didst thou conceal the dream so long?      FRIGGA.      It is but now that it is clear to me,    Now that I can compare.      BRUNHILDA.      If I rejoiced    When my prophetic vision saw this land,    I must rejoice again.      FRIGGA.      Thou surely shalt!    [Illustration: SIEGFRIED'S RETURN FROM THE SAXON WAR _From the  Painting by Schnorr von Carolsfeld_]      BRUNHILDA.       And yet it seems to me the vision dealt    With stars and metals too.      FRIGGA.      Yes, that is so.    Thou said'st the stars gleamed still more brightly here.    But yet that gold and silver were but dull.      BRUNHILDA.      Was't so?      FRIGGA (_to_ HAGEN).      Is't not the truth?      HAGEN.      I paid no heed.      BRUNHILDA.      I beg you all to treat me as a child;    Though I shall grow up faster than another.    Yet now I am no better.      (_To_ FRIGGA.)      That was all?      FRIGGA.       Yes, all!      BRUNHILDA.      Then all is well! Then all is well!      UTE (_to_ GUNTHER, _who has approached_).      My son, if she's too bitter toward thee now,    But give her time! The clamor of the crows    And ravens that she heard could never make    Her heart grow softer, but 'twill soften now    With the lark's song and with the nightingale.      HAGEN. So speaks the minstrel when he is in love,    And plays with foolish puppies. 'Tis enough!    The maiden must have time to find her heart,    But for the princess, hold her to her word;    By right of conquest she's already thine.--Then    claim thy rights!      (_He calls_.)"]]]
