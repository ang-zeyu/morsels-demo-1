The sketch shows two more  that may be added to the list. A and B are front and side views of  a lamp-screen, and C is a dumbbell. The lamp shade is particularly  useful for shading the eyes when reading or writing and, if  enameled white on the concave side, makes an excellent reflector  for drawing at night, or for microscopic work.    The standard and base, consisting of an ordinary pipe flange  bushed down to receive the upright nipple, are enameled a jet  black, and if the device is to be used on a polished table, a  piece of    [Illustration: Lamp Shade and Dumbbell]    felt should be glued to the bottom. A good way to hold the fan in  the nipple is to use a small wedge.    The dumbbells are made of short pieces of 3/4-in. pipe with  1-2-in. couplings fastened to each end by pouring melted lead in  the space between the pipes and the couplings. The appearance is  greatly improved by enameling black, and if desired the handles  may be covered with leather.  --Contributed by C. E. Warren, M. D., North Easton, Mass.        ** Sealing-Wax Bent While Cold [61]    If a piece of sealing-wax is supported in a horizontal position by  one end, as shown at A in the sketch, it will gradually bend to  the shape indicated by the dotted lines B. To attempt bending it  with the hands would result in breaking it unless a steady  pressure were applied for a long time. This peculiar property is  also found in ice.    [Illustration: Bending Cold Sealing-Wax]        ** Homemade Pottery Kiln [62]    A small kiln for baking clay figures may be built at a cost of $1.  The following shows the general plan of such a kiln which has  stood the test of 200 firings, and which is good for any work  requiring less than 1400 deg. C.    Get an iron pail about 1 ft. high by 1 ft. across, with a cover.  Any old pail which is thick enough will do, while a new one will  cost about 80 cents. In the bottom of this cut a 2-in. round hole  and close it with a cork or wood plug, A, Fig. 1, which shall  project at least 2 in. inside the pail. Make a cylindrical core of  wood, B, Fig. 1, 8 in. long and 8 in. across. Make a    [Illustration: Homemade Pottery Kiln]    mixture of clay, 60%; sand, 15%; and graphite, 25%, kneading  thoroughly in water to a good molding consistency. Line the pail,  bottom and sides, with heavy paper and cover the core with same.  Now pack the bottom of the pail thoroughly with a 2-in. layer of  the clay mixture, and on it set the paper wrapped core, carefully  centering it. The 2 in. of space between the core and the sides of  the pail all around is to be filled with clay, C, as is shown in  the sketch, using a little at a time and packing it very tight. In  like manner make the cover of the kiln, cutting the hole a little  smaller, about 1 in. At the edge or rim of the cover encircle a  2-in. strip of sheet iron, E, Fig. 2, to hold the clay mixture, C.  Set aside for a few days until well dried.    While these are drying you may be making a muffle, if there is to  be any glazing done. This is a clay cylinder (Fig. 3) with false  top and bottom, in which the pottery to be glazed is protected  from any smoke or dust. It is placed inside the kiln, setting on  any convenient blocks which will place it midway. The walls of the  muffle should be about 1/2 in. thick, and the dimensions should  allow at least 1 in. of space all around for the passage of heat  between it and the walls of the kiln. By the time the clay of the  kiln is well dried, it will be found that it has all shrunk away  from the iron about 3/8 in. After removing all the paper, pack  this space-top, bottom and sides with moist ground asbestos. If  the cover of the pail has no rim, it may be fastened to the  asbestos and clay lining by punching a few holes, passing wire  nails through and clinching them. Fit all the parts together  snugly, take out the plugs in the top and bottom, and your kiln is  ready for business. The handle of the pail will be convenient for  moving it about, and it can be set on three bricks or some more  elaborate support, as dictated by fancy and expense.    The temperature required for baking earthenware is 1250  degrees--1310 degrees, C.,; hotel china, 1330 degrees; hard  porcelain, 1390 degrees-1410 degrees. These temperatures can not  be obtained in the above kiln by means of the ordinary Bunsen  burner. If will be necessary either to buy the largest size  Bunsen, or make one yourself, if you have the materials. If you  can get a cone which can be screwed into an inch pipe, file the  opening of the cone to 1/16 in. diameter, and jacket the whole  with a 2-1/2-in. pipe. The flame end of this burner tube should be  about 4-1/2 in. above the cone opening and should be covered with  gauze to prevent flame from snapping back. When lighted, the point  of the blue flame, which is the hottest part, should be just in  the hole in the bottom of the kiln. Such a burner will be cheaply  made and will furnish a kiln temperature of 1400 degrees, but it  will burn a great deal of gas.    A plumber's torch of medium size will cost more in the beginning,  but will be cheaper in operation. Whatever burner is used, the  firing should be gradual, and with especial caution the first  time. By experiment you will find that a higher temperature is  obtained by placing a 1-in. pipe 2-ft. long over the lid hole as a  chimney. It would be still more effective to get another iron  pail, 2 in. wider than the kiln, and get a down draft by inverting  it over the kiln at whatever height proves most suitable. --G. L.  W.        ** How to Make a Small Medical Induction Coil [63]    The coil to be described is 3-1/2 in., full length of iron core,  and 3/4 in. in diameter.    Procure a bundle of small iron wire, say 1/4 in. in diameter, and  cut it 3-1/2 in. long; bind neatly with coarse thread and file the  ends smooth (Fig. 1). This done, make two wood ends, 1-1/4 by  1-1/4 in. and 3/8 in. thick, and varnish. Bore holes in the center  of each so the core will fit in snugly and leave about 1/4 in.  projecting from each end (Fig. 1).    After finishing the core, shellac two layers of  thick paper over  it between the ends; let this dry thoroughly. Wind two layers of  bell magnet wire over this, allowing several inches of free wire  to come through a hole in the end. Cover with paper and shellac as  before. Wind about 1/8 in. of fine wire, such    [Illustration: Medical Induction Coil]    as used on telephone generators, around the coil, leaving long  terminals. Soak the whole in melted paraffin and let cool; bind  tightly with black silk.    The vibrator is made of a piece of thin tin to which is soldered  the head of an iron screw and on the other side a small piece of  platinum, which can be taken from an old electric bell (Fig. 2).    Of course, a regulator must be had for the vibrator; this can be  accomplished by bending a stout piece of copper wire as shown. The  connections and the base for setting up are shown in the figures.  --Contributed by J. T. R., Washington, D. C.        ** Mechanical Trick With Cards [63]    The following mechanical card trick is easy to prepare and simple  to perform:    First, procure a new deck, and divide it into two piles, one  containing the red cards and the other the black ones, all cards  facing the same way. Take the red cards, square them up and place  in a vise. Then, with a plane, plane off the upper right hand  corner and lower left hand corner, as in Fig. 1, about 1/16 in.    Then take the black cards, square them up, and plane off about  1/16 in. on the upper left hand corner and lower right hand  corner, as in Fig. 2.    Next restore all the cards to one pack, taking care to have the  first card red, the next black, and so on, every alternate card  being the same color. Bend the pack so as to give some spring to  the cards, and by holding one thumb on the upper left-hand corner    [Illustration: Card Trick]    all the cards will appear red to the audience; place thumb in the  center at top of pack and they will appear mixed, red and black;  with thumb on upper right-hand corner all cards appear black. You  can display either color called for.  --Contributed by Ralph Gingrich, Chicago.        ** How to Make a Rain Gauge [64]    An accurate rain gauge may be easily constructed from galvanized  iron, as shown in the sketch herewith. The funnel, A, overlaps and  rests on the body, B, and discharges into the tube, C, the area of  which is one-tenth that of the top of the funnel. The depth of the  water in C is thus ten times the actual rainfall, so that by  measuring it with a stick marked off in tenths of an inch, we  obtain the result in hundredths of an inch.    A good size to make the rain gauge is as follows: A, 8 in.  diameter; C, 2.53 in. ; length of C, about 20 in. It should be  placed in an exposed location, so that no inaccuracy will occur  from wind currents. To find the fall of snow, pour a known  quantity    [Illustration: Rain Gauge]    of warm water on the snow contained in the funnel and deduct the  quantity poured in from the total amount in the tube.  --Contributed by Thurston Hendrickson, Long Branch, N.J.        ** How to Make an Aquarium [64]    In making an aquarium, the first thing to decide on is the size.  It is well not to attempt building a very large one, as the  difficulties increase with the size. A good size is 12 by 12 by 20  in., and this is inexpensive to build.    First buy one length of 3/4 by 1/8-in. angle iron for the frame, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12661"],[0,"Canada under British Rule 1760-1900 (#18)"],[1,"the  majority felt a deep bitterness in their hearts as they landed on new  shores of which they had heard most depressing accounts. More than  thirty-five thousand men, women and children, made their homes within  the limits of the present Dominion. In addition to these actual American  Loyalists, there were several thousands of negroes, fugitives from their  owners, or servants of the exiles, who have been generally counted in  the loose estimates made of the migration of 1783, and the greater  number of whom were at a later time deported from Nova Scotia to Sierra  Leone. Of the exiles at least twenty-five thousand went to the maritime  colonies, and built up the province of New Brunswick, where  representative institutions were established in 1784. Of the ten  thousand people who sought the valley of the St Lawrence, some settled  in Montreal, at Chambly, and in parts of the present Eastern Townships,  but the great majority accepted grants of land on the banks of the St.  Lawrence--from River Beaudette, on Lake St. Francis, as far as the  beautiful Bay of Quinte--in the Niagara District, and on the shores of  Lake Erie. The coming of these people, subsequently known by the name of  \"U.E. Loyalists\"--a name appropriately given to them in recognition of  their fidelity to a United Empire--was a most auspicious event for the  British-American provinces, the greater part of which was still a  wilderness. As we have seen in the previous chapters, there was in the  Acadian provinces, afterwards divided into New Brunswick and Nova  Scotia, a British population of only some 14,000 souls, mostly confined  to the peninsula. In the valley of the St. Lawrence there was a French  population of probably 100,000 persons, dwelling chiefly on the banks of  the St. Lawrence between Quebec and Montreal. The total British  population of the province of Quebec did not exceed 2000, residing for  the most part in the towns of Quebec and Montreal. No English people  were found west of Lake St. Louis; and what is now the populous province  of Ontario was a mere wilderness, except where loyal refugees had  gathered about the English fort at Niagara, or a few French settlers had  made homes for themselves on the banks of the Detroit River and Lake St.  Clair. The migration of between 30,000 and 40,000 Loyalists to the  maritime provinces and the valley of the St. Lawrence was the saving of  British interests in the great region which England still happily  retained in North America.    The refugees who arrived in Halifax in 1783 were so numerous that  hundreds had to be placed in the churches or in cabooses taken from the  transports and ranged along the streets. At Guysborough, in Nova  Scotia--so named after Sir Guy Carleton--the first village, which was  hastily built by the settlers, was destroyed by a bush fire, and many  persons only saved their lives by rushing into the sea. At Shelburne, on  the first arrival of the exiles, there were seen \"lines of women sitting  on the rocky shore and weeping at their altered condition.\" Towns and  villages, however, were soon built for the accommodation of the people.  At Shelburne, or Port Roseway--anglicised from the French _Razoir_--a  town of fourteen thousand people, with wide streets, fine houses, some  of them containing furniture and mantel-pieces brought from New York,  arose in two or three years. The name of New Jerusalem had been given to  the same locality some years before, but it seemed a mockery to the  Loyalists when they found that the place they had chosen for their new  home was quite unsuited for settlement. A beautiful harbour lay in  front, and a rocky country unfit for farmers in the rear of their  ambitious town, which at one time was the most populous in British North  America. In the course of a few years the place was almost deserted, and  sank for a time into insignificance. A pretty town now nestles by the  side of the beautiful and spacious harbour which attracted the first too  hopeful settlers; and its residents point out to the tourist the sites  of the buildings of last century, one or two of which still stand, and  can show many documents and relics of those early days.    Over twelve thousand Loyalists, largely drawn from the disbanded loyal  regiments of the old colonies, settled in New Brunswick. The name of  Parrtown was first given, in honour of the governor of Nova Scotia, to  the infant settlement which became the city of St. John, in 1785, when  it was incorporated. The first landing of the loyal pioneers took place  on the 18th of May, 1783, at what is now the Market Slip of this  interesting city. Previous to 1783, the total population of the province  did not exceed seven hundred souls, chiefly at Maugerville and other  places on the great river. The number of Loyalists who settled on the  St. John River was at least ten thousand, of whom the greater proportion  were established at the mouth of the river, which was the base of  operations for the peopling of the new province. Some adventurous  spirits took possession of the abandoned French settlements at Grimross  and St. Anne's, where they repaired some ruined huts of the original  Acadian occupants, or built temporary cabins. This was the beginning of  the settlement of Fredericton, which four years later became the  political capital on account of its central position, its greater  security in time of war, and its location on the land route to Quebec.  Many of the people spent their first winter in log-huts, bark camps, and  tents covered with spruce, or rendered habitable only by the heavy banks  of snow which were piled against them. A number of persons died through  exposure, and \"strong, proud men\"--to quote the words of one who lived  in those sorrowful days--\"wept like children and lay down in their  snow-bound tents to die.\"    A small number of loyal refugees had found their way to the valley of  the St. Lawrence as early as 1778, and obtained employment in the  regiments organised under Sir John Johnson and others. It was not until  1783 and 1784 that the large proportion of the exiles came to Western  Canada. They settled chiefly on the northern banks of the St. Lawrence,  in what are now the counties of Glengarry, Stormont, Dundas, Grenville,  Leeds, Frontenac, Addington, Lennox, Hastings and Prince Edward, where  their descendants have acquired wealth and positions of honour and  trust. The first township laid out in Upper Canada, now Ontario, was  Kingston. The beautiful Bay of Quinte is surrounded by a country full of  the memories of this people, and the same is true of the picturesque  district of Niagara.    Among the Loyalists of Canada must also be honourably mentioned Joseph  Brant (Thayendanega), the astute and courageous chief of the Mohawks,  the bravest nation of the Iroquois confederacy, who fought on the side  of England during the war. At its close he and his people settled in  Canada, where they received large grants from the government, some in a  township by the Bay of Quinte, which still bears the Indian title of the  great warrior, and the majority on the Grand River, where a beautiful  city and county perpetuate the memory of this loyal subject of the  British crown. The first Anglican church built in Upper Canada was that  of the Mohawks, near Brantford, and here the church bell first broke the  silence of the illimitable forest.    The difficulties which the Upper Canadian immigrants had to undergo  before reaching their destination were much greater than was the case  with the people who went direct in ships from American ports to Halifax  and other places on the Atlantic coast. The former had to make toilsome  journeys by land, or by _bateaux_ and canoes up the St. Lawrence, the  Richelieu, the Genesee, and other streams which gave access from the  interior of the United States to the new Canadian land. The British  government did its best to supply the wants of the population suddenly  thrown upon its charitable care, but, despite all that could be done for  them in the way of food and means of fighting the wilderness, they  suffered naturally a great deal of hardship. The most influential  immigration found its way to the maritime provinces, where many received  congenial employment and adequate salaries in the new government of New  Brunswick. Many others, with the wrecks of their fortunes or the  pecuniary aid granted them by the British government, were able to make  comfortable homes and cultivate estates in the valleys of the St. John  and Annapolis, and in other fertile parts of the lower provinces. Of the  large population that founded Shelburne a few returned to the United  States, but the greater number scattered all over the provinces. The  settlers in Upper Canada had to suffer many trials for years after their  arrival, and especially in a year of famine, when large numbers had to  depend on wild fruits and roots. Indeed, had it not been for the fish  and game which were found in some, but not in all, places, starvation  and death would have been the lot of many hundreds of helpless people.    Many of the refugees could trace their descent to the early immigration  that founded the colonies of Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. Some were  connected with the Cavalier and Church families of Virginia. Others were  of the blood of persecuted Huguenots and German Protestants from the  Rhenish or Lower Palatinate. Not a few were Highland Scotchmen, who had  been followers of the Stuarts, and yet fought for King George and the  British connection during the American revolution. Among the number were  notable Anglican clergymen, eminent judges and lawyers, and probably one  hundred graduates of Harvard, Yale, King's, Pennsylvania, and William  and Mary Colleges. In the records of industrial enterprise, of social  and intellectual progress, of political development for a hundred  years, we find the names of many eminent men, sprung from these"]]]
