Her white  folks got in debt. My papa was born in Georgia. Folks named Williams  owned him. Ma never seen her ma no more but William Hull went to  Virginia and bought her two sisters.    \"I was named Patsy after grandma in Virginia. She had twenty-one  children to ma's knowing. Ma was a light color. Pa was a Molly Glaspy  man. That means he was Indian and African. Molly Glaspy folks was nearly  always free folks. Ma was named Mattie. If they would have no children  they got trafficked about.    \"Daphney Hull was good but William Hull and his wife was both mean. They  lived on the main road to Holly Springs. Daphney Hull was a Methodist  man, kind-hearted and good. He was a bachelor I think. He kept a woman  to cook and keep his house. Auntie said the Yankees was mean to Mr.  William Hull's wife. They took all their money and meat. They had their  money hid and some of the black folks let the Yankees find out where it  was. They got it.    \"Papa was a soldier. He sent for us. We come to Memphis, Tennessee in a  wagon. We lived there five or six years. Pa got a pension till he died.  Both my parents was field hands in slavery. Ma took in washing and  ironing in Memphis.    \"I was born in De Sota County, Mississippi. I remember Forrest's battle  in Memphis. I didn't have sense to be scared. I seen black and white  dead in the streets and alleys. We went to the magazine house for  protection, and we played and stayed there. They tried to open the  magazine house but couldn't.    \"When freedom come, folks left home, out in the streets, crying,  praying, singing, shouting, yelling, and knocking down everything. Some  shot off big guns. Den come the calm. It was sad then. So many folks  done dead, things tore up and nowheres to go and nothing to eat, nothing  to do. It got squally. Folks got sick, so hungry. Some folks starved  nearly to death. Times got hard. We went to the washtub onliest way we  all could live. Ma was a cripple woman. Pa couldn't find work for so  long when he mustered out.    \"I do recollect the Civil War well.    \"I live with my daughter. I have a cough since I had flu and now I have  chills and fever. My daughter helps me all I get. She lives with me.    \"Some of the young folks is mighty good. I reckon some is too loose  acting. Times is hard. Harder in the winter than in summer time. We has  our garden and chickens to help us out in summer.\"          Interviewer: Mrs. Bernice Bowden  Person interviewed: Ada Moorehead                      2300 E. Barraque, Pine Bluff, Arkansas  Age: 82?      \"I was here in slavery times, honey, but I don't know exactly how old I  am. I was born in Huntsville, Alabama but you know in them days old  folks didn't tell the young folks no thin' and I was so small when they  brought me here. I don't know what year I was born but I believe I'm  about eighty-two. You know when a person ain't able to work and dabble  out his own clothes, you know he's gone a long ways.    \"My white folks was Ad White what owned me. Called him Marse Ad. Don't  call folks marse much now-days.    \"My father was sold away from us in Alabama and we heard he was here in  Pine Bluff so Aunt Fanny brought us here. She just had a road full of us  and brought us here to Arkansas. We walked. We was a week on the road. I  know we started here on Monday morning and we got here to the courthouse  on the next Monday round about noon. That was that old courthouse. I  reckon that ground is in the river now.    \"When we got here I saw my father. He took me to his sister--that was my  Aunt Savannah--and dropped me down.    \"Mrs. Reynolds raised me. She come to Aunt Savannah's house and hired me  the very same day I got here. I nursed Miss Katie. She was bout a month  old. You know--a little long dress baby. Don't wear then long dresses  now--gettin' wiser.    \"Mrs. Reynolds she was good to me. And since she's gone looks like I'm  gone too--gone to the dogs. Cause when Mrs. Reynolds got a dress for  Miss Katie--got one for me too.    \"My father was a soldier in the war. Last time I heard from him I know  he was hauling salt to the breastworks. Yes, I was here in the war. That  was all right to me but I wished a many a time I wasn't here.    \"I went to school two or three days in a week for about a term. But I  didn't learn to read much. Had to hire out and help raise my brother and  sister. I'm goin' to this here government school now. I goes every  afternoon.    \"Since I got old I can think bout the old times. It comes to me. I  didn't pay attention to nothin' much when I was young.    \"Oh Lord, I don't know what's goin' to become of us old folks. Wasn't  for the Welfare, I don't know what I'd do.    \"I was sixteen when I married. I sure did marry young. I married young  so I could see my chillun grown. I never married but once and I stayed a  married woman forty-nine years to the very day my old man died. Lived  with one man forty-nine years. I had my hand and heart full. I had a  home of my own. How many chillun? Me? I had nine of my own and I raised  other folks' chillun. Oh, I been over this world right smart--first one  thing and then another. I know a lot of white folks. They all been  pretty good to me.\"          Interviewer: Mary D. Hudgins  Person Interviewed: Mrs. Mary Jane (Mattie) Mooreman  Home: with son  Age: 90      \"Yes, ma'am. I've been in Hot Springs, been in Hot Springs 57 years.  That's a long time. Lots of changes have come--I've seen lots of changes  here--changed from wooden sidewalks and little wood buildings.    \"Your name's Hudgins? I knew the Hudginses--knew Miss Nora well. What's  that? Did I know Adeline? Did I know Adeline! Do you mean to tell me  she's still alive? Adeline! Why Miss Maud,\" (addressing Mrs. Eisele, for  whom she works--and who sat nearby to help in the interview) \"Miss  Maude, I tell you Adeline's WHITE, she's white clean through!\" (see  interview with Adeline Blakeley, who incidentally is as black as \"the  ace of spades\"--in pigmentation.) \"Miss Maude, you never knew anybody  like Adeline. She bossed those children and made them mind--just like  they was hers. She took good care of them.\" (Turning to the interviewer)  \"You know how the Hudgins always was about their children. Adeline  thought every one of 'em was made out of gold---made out of pure GOLD.    \"She made 'em mind. I remember once, she was down on Central Avenue with  Ross and he did southing or other that, wasn't nice. She walked over to  the umbrella stand, you remember how they used to have umbrellas for  sale out in front of the stores. She grabbed an umbrella and she whipped  Ross with it--she didn't hurt him. Then she put it back in the stand  and said to the man who ran the store, 'If that umbrella's hurt, just  charge it to Harve Hudgins.' That's the way Adeline was. So she's still  alive. Law how I'd like to see her. Bring me a picture of her. Oh Miss  Mary, I'd love to have it.    \"Me? I was born on Green river near Hartford, Kentucky. Guess I was  about a year and a half, from what they told me when my mistress  married. Don't know how she ever met my master. She was raised in a  convent and his folks lived a long way from hers. But anyhow she did.  She was just 13 when she married. The man she married was named Charles  Mooreman M-O-O-R-E-M-A-N. They had a son called Charles Wycliff  Mooreman. He was named for his mother's people. I got a son I called  Charles Wycliff too. He works at the Arlington. He's a waiter. They say  he looks just like me. Mr. Charles Wycliff Mooreman--back in Kentucky.  I still gets letters from him.    \"Miss Mary I guess I had a pretty easy time in slavery days. They was  good to us. Besides I was a house niggah.\" (Those who have been \"house  niggahs\" never quibble at the word slave or negro. A subtle social  distinction brewed in the black race to separate house servants from  field hands as far as wealthy planters from \"poor white trash.\".) \"Once  I heard a man say of my mother, 'You could put on a white boiled shirt  and lie flat down on the floor in her kitchen and not get dirty.'\"    \"Cook? No, ma'am!\" (with dignity and indignation) \"I never cooked until  after I was married, and I never washed, never washed so much as a rag.  All I washed was the babies and maybe my mistress's feet. I was a lady's  maid. I'd wait on my mistress and I'd knit sox for all the folks. When  they would sleep it was our duty--us maids--to fan 'em with feathers  made out of turkey feathers--feather fans. Part of it was to keep 'em  cool. Then they didn't have screens like we have today. So part of it  was to keep the flies off. I remember how we couldn't stomp our feet to  keep the flies from biting for fear of waking 'em up.    \"No, Miss Mary, we didn't get such, good food. Nobody had all the kinds  of things we have today. We had mostly buttermilk and cornbread and fat  meat. Cake? 'Deed we didn't. I remember once they baked a cake and Mr.  Charles Wycliff--he was just a little boy--he got in and took a whole  fistful out of the cake. When Miss found out about it, she give us all  doses of salts--enough to make us all throw up. She gave it to all the  niggahs and the children--the white children. And what did she find out?  It was her own child who had done it.    \"Yes ma'am we learned to read and write. Oh, Miss Maude now--I don't  want to recite. I don't want to.\" (But she did \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little  Star\" and \"The Playful Kitten\"--the latter all of 40 lines.) \"I think, I  think they both come out of McGuffey's second Reader. Yes ma'am I  remember's McGuffey's and the Blueback speller too.    \"No, Miss Mary, there wasn't so much of the war that was fought around  us. I remember that old Master used to go out in the front yard and  stand by a locust tree "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547"],[0,"Blackfoot Lodge Tales: The Story of a Prairie People (#18)"],[1,"their way to the Blackfoot  camp. When they got there, they told that when they had left the Cree camp  E-k[=u]s'kini was surrounded, and the firing was terrible. When  E-k[=u]s'-kini's father heard this, he got on his horse and rode through  the camp, calling out: \"My boy is surrounded; let us turn out and go to  help him. I have no doubt they are many tens to one, but he is powerful,  and he may be fighting yet.\" No time was lost in getting ready, and soon a  large party started for the Cree camp. When they came to the battle-ground,  the camp had been moved a long time. The old man looked about, trying to  gather up his son's body, but it was found only in small pieces, and not  more than half of it could be gathered up.    After the fight was over, the Crees started on down to go to their own  country. One day six Crees were travelling along on foot, scouting far  ahead. As they were going down into a little ravine, a grizzly bear jumped  up in front of them and ran after them. The bear overtook, and tore up,  five of them, one after another. The sixth got away, and came home to  camp. The Crees and the Blackfeet believe that this was the spirit of  E-k[=u]s'-kini, for thus he comes back. They think that he is still on the  earth, but in a different shape.    E-k[=u]s'-kini was killed about forty years ago. When he was killed, he was  still a boy, not married, only about twenty-four years old.            STORIES OF ANCIENT TIMES            SCARFACE    ORIGIN OF THE MEDICINE LODGE      I    In the earliest times there was no war. All the tribes were at peace. In  those days there was a man who had a daughter, a very beautiful girl. Many  young men wanted to marry her, but every time she was asked, she only shook  her head and said she did not want a husband.    \"How is this?\" asked her father. \"Some of these young men are rich,  handsome, and brave.\"    \"Why should I marry?\" replied the girl. \"I have a rich father and  mother. Our lodge is good. The parfleches are never empty. There are plenty  of tanned robes and soft furs for winter. Why worry me, then?\"    The Raven Bearers held a dance; they all dressed carefully and wore their  ornaments, and each one tried to dance the best. Afterwards some of them  asked for this girl, but still she said no. Then the Bulls, the Kit-foxes,  and others of the _I-kun-uh'-kah-tsi_ held their dances, and all those who  were rich, many great warriors, asked this man for his daughter, but to  every one of them she said no. Then her father was angry, and said: \"Why,  now, this way? All the best men have asked for you, and still you say no. I  believe you have a secret lover.\"    \"Ah!\" said her mother. \"What shame for us should a child be born and our  daughter still unmarried!\" \"Father! mother!\" replied the girl, \"pity me. I  have no secret lover, but now hear the truth. That Above Person, the Sun,  told me, 'Do not marry any of those men, for you are mine; thus you shall  be happy, and live to great age'; and again he said, 'Take heed. You must  not marry. You are mine.'\"    \"Ah!\" replied her father. \"It must always be as he says.\" And they talked  no more about it.    There was a poor young man, very poor. His father, mother, all his  relations, had gone to the Sand Hills. He had no lodge, no wife to tan his  robes or sew his moccasins. He stopped in one lodge to-day, and to-morrow  he ate and slept in another; thus he lived. He was a good-looking young  man, except that on his cheek he had a scar, and his clothes were always  old and poor.    After those dances some of the young men met this poor Scarface, and they  laughed at him, and said: \"Why don't you ask that girl to marry you? You  are so rich and handsome!\" Scarface did not laugh; he replied: \"Ah! I will  do as you say. I will go and ask her.\" All the young men thought this was  funny. They laughed a great deal. But Scarface went down by the river. He  waited by the river, where the women came to get water, and by and by the  girl came along. \"Girl,\" he said, \"wait. I want to speak with you. Not as a  designing person do I ask you, but openly where the Sun looks down, and all  may see.\"    \"Speak then,\" said the girl.    \"I have seen the days,\" continued the young man \"You have refused those who  are young, and rich, and brave. Now, to-day, they laughed and said to me,  'Why do you not ask her?' I am poor, very poor. I have no lodge, no food,  no clothes, no robes and warm furs. I have no relations; all have gone to  the Sand Hills; yet, now, to-day, I ask you, take pity, be my wife.\"    The girl hid her face in her robe and brushed the ground with the point of  her moccasin, back and forth, back and forth; for she was thinking. After a  time she said: \"True. I have refused all those rich young men, yet now the  poor one asks me, and I am glad. I will be your wife, and my people will be  happy. You are poor, but it does not matter. My father will give you  dogs. My mother will make us a lodge. My people will give us robes and  furs. You will be poor no longer.\"    Then the young man was happy, and he started to kiss her, but she held him  back, and said: \"Wait! The Sun has spoken to me. He says I may not marry;  that I belong to him. He says if I listen to him, I shall live to great  age. But now I say: Go to the Sun. Tell him, 'She whom you spoke with  heeds your words. She has never done wrong, but now she wants to marry. I  want her for my wife.' Ask him to take that scar from your face. That will  be his sign. I will know he is pleased. But if he refuses, or if you fail  to find his lodge, then do not return to me.\"    \"Oh!\" cried the young man, \"at first your words were good. I was glad. But  now it is dark. My heart is dead. Where is that far-off lodge? where the  trail, which no one yet has travelled?\"    \"Take courage, take courage!\" said the girl; and she went to her lodge.      II    Scarface was very sad. He sat down and covered his head with his robe and  tried to think what to do. After a while he got up, and went to an old  woman who had been kind to him. \"Pity me,\" he said. \"I am very poor. I am  going away now on a long journey. Make me some moccasins.\"    \"Where are you going?\" asked the old woman. \"There is no war; we are very  peaceful here.\"    \"I do not know where I shall go,\" replied Scarface. \"I am in trouble, but I  cannot tell you now what it is.\"    So the old woman made him some moccasins, seven pairs, with parfleche  soles, and also she gave him a sack of food,--pemmican of berries, pounded  meat, and dried back fat; for this old woman had a good heart. She liked  the young man.    All alone, and with a sad heart, he climbed the bluffs and stopped to take  a last look at the camp. He wondered if he would ever see his sweetheart  and the people again. \"_ Hai'-yu!_ Pity me, O Sun,\" he prayed, and turning,  he started to find the trail.    For many days he travelled on, over great prairies, along timbered rivers  and among the mountains, and every day his sack of food grew lighter; but  he saved it as much as he could, and ate berries, and roots, and sometimes  he killed an animal of some kind. One night he stopped by the home of a  wolf. \"_Hai-yah!_\" said that one; \"what is my brother doing so far from  home?\"    \"Ah!\" replied Scarface, \"I seek the place where the Sun lives; I am sent to  speak with him.\"    \"I have travelled far,\" said the wolf. \"I know all the prairies, the  valleys, and the mountains, but I have never seen the Sun's home. Wait; I  know one who is very wise. Ask the bear. He may tell you.\"    The next day the man travelled on again, stopping now and then to pick a  few berries, and when night came he arrived at the bear's lodge.    \"Where is your home?\" asked the bear. \"Why are you travelling alone, my  brother?\"    \"Help me! Pity me!\" replied the young man; \"because of her words[1] I seek  the Sun. I go to ask him for her.\"    [Footnote 1: A Blackfoot often talks of what this or that person said,  without mentioning names.]    \"I know not where he stops,\" replied the bear. \"I have travelled by many  rivers, and I know the mountains, yet I have never seen his lodge. There is  some one beyond, that striped-face, who is very smart. Go and ask him.\"    The badger was in his hole. Stooping over, the young man shouted: \"Oh,  cunning striped-face! Oh, generous animal! I wish to speak with you.\"    \"What do you want?\" said the badger, poking his head out of the hole.    \"I want to find the Sun's home,\" replied Scarface. \"I want to speak with  him.\"    \"I do not know where he lives,\" replied the badger. \"I never travel very  far. Over there in the timber is a wolverine. He is always travelling  around, and is of much knowledge. Maybe he can tell you.\"    Then Scarface went to the woods and looked all around for the wolverine,  but could not find him. So he sat down to rest \"_Hai'-yu! Hai'-yu!_\" he  cried. \"Wolverine, take pity on me. My food is gone, my moccasins worn out.  Now I must die.\"    \"What is it, my brother?\" he heard, and looking around, he saw the animal  sitting near.    \"She whom I would marry,\" said Scarface, \"belongs to the Sun; I am trying  to find where he lives, to ask him for her.\"    \"Ah!\" said the wolverine. \"I know where he lives. Wait; it is nearly  night. To-morrow I will show you the trail to the big water. He lives on  the other side of it.\"    Early in the morning, the wolverine showed him the trail, and Scarface  followed it until he came to the water's edge. He looked out over it, and  his heart almost stopped. Never before had any one seen such a big  water. The other side could not be seen, and there was no end to  it. Scarface sat down on the shore. His food was all gone, his moccasins  worn out. His heart was sick. \"I cannot cross this big water,\" he said. \"I  cannot return to the people. Here, by this water, I shall die.\"    Not so. His Helpers were there. Two swans came swimming up to the  shore. \"Why have you come here?\" they asked him. \""]]]
