[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13640"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 821, September 26, 1891 (#18)"],[1,"    Other facts also plead in favor of the transformation of a portion of  albumen into fat within the economy, notably the changing of a portion  of dead organism into what is known as \"cadaveric fat,\" and the very  rapid fatty degeneration of organs that supervenes upon certain forms of  poisoning, as by phosphorus.    The carbohydrates, or more properly speaking hydrocarbons, are regarded  by all physiologists as specially capable of producing fat, and numerous  alimentary experiments have been undertaken to prove this point.  Chaniewski, Meissl, and Munk obtained results that evidenced,  apparently, sugar and starch provide more fat than do the albuminoids.  Voit, however, disapproves this, maintaining the greater part of the  hydrocarbons is burned (furnishes fuel for the immediate evolution of  force), and that fat cannot be stored up unless a due proportion of  albuminoids is also administered. He believes the hydrocarbons exert a  direct influence only; being more oxidizable than fats, they guard the  latter from oxidation. This protective role of the hydrocarbons applies  also to the albuminoids.    We may believe, then, that the three great classes of aliment yield fat,  in some degree; that alimentary fat may be fixed in the tissues; and  that hydrocarbons favor the deposition of adipose either directly or  indirectly.    It is well understood that fat may disappear with great rapidity under  certain conditions; many maladies are accompanied by speedy emaciation;  therefore, as fat never passes into the secretions, at least not in  appreciable quantities, it probably undergoes transformation, perhaps by  oxidation or a form of fermentation, the final results of which are,  directly or indirectly, water and cadaveric acid. It is certain the  process of oxidation favors the destruction of adipose, and that  everything which inhibits such destruction tends to fat accumulation.    Since the earliest period of history, there seems to have been an  anxiety to secure some regimen of general application that would reduce  or combat obesity. Thus Hippocrates says:    Fat people, and all those who would become lean, should perform  laborious tasks while fasting, and eat while still breathless from  fatigue, without rest, and after having drunk diluted wine not very  cold. Their meats should be prepared with sesamum, with sweets, and  other similar substances, and these dishes should be free from fat.    In this manner one will be satiated through eating less.    But, besides, one should take only one meal; take no bath; sleep on a  hard bed; and walk as much as may be.    How much has medical science gained in this direction during the  interval of more than two thousand years? Let us see:    First among moderns to seek to establish on a scientific basis a regimen  for the obese, was Dancel, who forbade fats, starchy foods, etc.,  prescribed soups and aqueous aliment, and reduced the quantity of  beverage to the lowest possible limit; at the same time he employed  frequent and profuse purgation.    This regimen, which permits, at most, but seven to twelve ounces of  fluid at each repast, is somewhat difficult to follow, though it may be  obtained, gradually, with ease. Dr. Constantine Paul records a case in  which this regimen, gradually induced, and followed for ten years,  rewarded the patient with \"moderate flesh and most excellent health.\"    In Great Britain, a mode of treatment instituted in one Banting, by Dr.  Harvey, whereby the former was decreased in weight forty pounds, has  obtained somewhat wide celebrity; and what is more remarkable, it is  known as \"Bantingism,\" taking its name from the patient instead of the  physician who originated it. The dietary is as follows:    _Breakfast_.--Five to six ounces of lean meat, broiled fish, or smoked  bacon--veal and pork interdicted; a cup of tea or coffee without milk or  sugar; one ounce of toast or dry biscuit (crackers).    _Dinner_.--Five or six ounces of lean meat or fish--excluding eel,  salmon, and herring; a small quantity of vegetables, but no potatoes,  parsnips, carrots, beets, peas, or beans; one ounce of toast, fruit, or  fowl; two glasses of red wine--beer, champagne, and port forbidden.    _Tea_.--Two or three ounces of fruit; one kind of pastry; one cup of  tea.    _Supper_.--Three or four ounces of lean beef or fish; one or two glasses  of red wine.    _At bed-time._--Grog without sugar (whisky and water, or rum and water),  and one or two glasses of sherry or Bordeaux.    \"Bantingism,\" to be effective, must be most closely followed, when,  unfortunately also, it proves extremely debilitating; it is suitable  only for sturdy, hard riding gluttons of the Squire Western type. The  patient rapidly loses strength as well as flesh, and speedily acquires  an unconquerable repugnance to the dietary. Further, from a strictly  physiological point of view, the quantity of meat is greatly in excess,  while with the cessation of the regimen, the fat quickly reappears.    Next Ebstein formulated a dietary that is certainly much better  tolerated than that of Harvey and Banting, and yields as good, or even  better, results. He allows patients to take a definite quantity--two to  two and a half ounces-of fat daily, in the form of bacon or butter  which, theoretically at least, offers several advantages: It diminishes  the sensations of hunger and thirst, and plays a special role with  respect to the albuminoids; the latter may thus be assimilated by the  economy without being resolved into fat, and thus the adipose of the  organism at this period is drawn upon without subsequent renewal. The  following is the outline:    _Breakfast_.--At 6 a.m. in summer; 7:30 in winter:--Eight ounces of  black tea without either milk or sugar; two ounces of white bread or  toast, with a copious layer of butter.    _Dinner_.--2 p.m.:--A modicum of beef marrow soup; four ounces of meat,  preferably of fatty character; moderate quantity of vegetable,  especially the legumines, but no potatoes or anything containing starch;  raw fruits in season, and cooked fruits (stewed, without sugar); two or  three glasses of light wine as a beverage, and after eating, a cup of  black tea without sugar.    _Supper_.--7:30 p m.:--An egg, bit of fat roast, ham, or bacon; a slice  of white bread well buttered; a large cup of black tea without milk or  sugar; from time to time, cheese and fresh fruits.    Germain See suggests as a modification of this regimen, the abundant use  of beverage, the addition of gelatins, and at times small doses of  potassium iodide in twenty cases he claims constant and relatively  prompt results.    Whatever may be urged for Ebstein's system--and it has afforded most  excellent results to Unna and to Lube, as well as its author--it  certainly exposes the patient to the terrors of dyspepsia, when the  routine must needs be interrupted or modified; hence it is not always to  be depended upon. As between dyspepsia and obesity, there are few, I  fancy, who would not prefer the latter.    Another \"system\" that has acquired no little celebrity, and which has  for its aim the reduction as far as possible of alimentary hydrocarbons  while permitting a certain proportion of fat, is that, of Denneth, which  necessarily follows somewhat closely the lines laid down by Ebstein.    Oertels' treatment, somewhat widely known, and not without due measure  of fame, is based upon a series of measures having as object the  withdrawal from both circulation and the economy at large, as much of  the fluids as possible. It is especially adapted for the relief of those  obese who are suffering fatty degeneration of the heart. The _menu_ is  as follows:    _Breakfast_.--Pour to five ounces of tea or coffee with a little milk;  two to two and a half ounces bread.    _Dinner_.--Three or four ounces of roast or boiled meat, or moderately  fat food; fish, slightly fat; salad and vegetables at pleasure; one and  a half ounces of bread (in certain cases as much as three ounces of  farinaceous food may be permitted); three to six ounces of fruit; at  times a little pastry for dessert.--In summer, if fruit is not  obtainable, six to eight ounces of light wine may be allowed.    _Tea_,--A cupful (four to five ounces) of tea or coffee, with a trifle  of milk, as at breakfast; one and three-fourths ounces of bread; and  exceptionally (and at most) six ounces of water.    _Supper_.--One to two soft boiled eggs; four or five ounces of meat; one  and three fourths ounces of bread; a trifle of cheese, salad, or fruit;  six to eight ounces of light wine diluted with an eighth volume of  water. The quantity of beverage may be slightly augmented at each meal  if necessary, especially if there is no morbid heart trouble.    Schwenninger (Bismarck's physician), who opened a large sanitarium near  Berlin a few years since for the treatment of the obese, employs  Oertel's treatment, modified in that an abundance of beverage is  permitted, provided it is not indulged in at meals; it is forbidden  until two hours after eating.    Both Oertel's and Schwenninger's methods have procured grave dyspepsias,  and fatal albuminurias as well, according to Meyer and Rosenfield. It  has been charged the allowance of beverage upon which Schwenninger lays  so much stress in the treatment at his sanitarium has a pecuniary basis,  in other words a commission upon the sale of wines.[2]    [Footnote 2: The sanitarium is owned by a stock company, Schwenninger  being merely Medical Director.--ED.]    Thus, it will be observed that while some forbid beverage, others rather  insist upon its employment in greater or less quantities. Under such  circumstances, it would seem but rational, before undertaking to relieve  obesity, to establish its exact nature, and also the role taken by  fluids in the phenomena of nutrition.    Physiologists generally admit water facilitates nutritive exchanges,  which is explained by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13642"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 1, January 1916 (#18)"],[1,"Esq.;  and John Parker, Esq.; merchants in your city; or from Mr. Samuel  Yockney, tea-dealer, in Bedford Row.

SKETCHES OF THE BLACK BAPTIST CHURCH AT SAVANNAH, IN GEORGIA; AND OF THEIR  MINISTER ANDREW BRYAN, EXTRACTED FROM SEVERAL LETTERS      Savannah, July 19, 1790, &c.    _Dear Brother_,    \"With pleasure I receive your favor of the 20th ult. more particularly,  as I trust the correspondence may be of use to Brother Andrew's  church; concerning the origin of which, I have taken from him the  following account.    \"Our Brother _Andrew_ was one of the black hearers of _George Liele,\"_  of whom an account was given before; and was hopefully converted by his  preaching from chapter III. of St. John's Gospel, and a clause of verse  7, _Ye must be born again_; prior to the departure of _George Liele_ for  Jamaica, he came up from Tybee River, where departing vessels frequently  lay ready for sea, and baptized our Brother _Andrew_, with a wench of  the name _Hagar_, both belonging to _Jonathan Bryan_, Esq.; these were  the last performances of our Brother _George Liele_ in this quarter.  About eight or nine months after his departure, _Andrew_ began to exhort  his black hearers, with a few whites. Edward Davis, Esq.; indulged him  and his hearers to erect a rough building on his land at _Yamacraw_, in  the suburbs of Savannah for a place of worship, of which they have been  very artfully dispossessed. In this their beginning of worship they had  frequent interruptions from the whites; as it was at a time that a  number of blacks had absconded, and some had been taken away by the  British. This was a plausible excuse for their wickedness in their  interruptions. The whites grew more and more inveterate; taking numbers  of them before magistrates--they were imprisoned and whipped. _Sampson_,  a brother of _Andrew_, belonging to the same master, was converted about  a year after him, and continued with him in all their persecutions, and  does until now. These, with many others, were twice imprisoned, and  about _fifty_ were severely whipped, particularly _Andrew, who was cut  and bled abundantly_, while he was under their lashes; Brother  _Hambleton_ says, he held up his hand, and told his persecutors that he  rejoiced not only to be whipped, but _would freely suffer death for the  cause of Jesus Christ_. \"The chief justice _Henry Osborne_, Esq.; _James  Habersham_, Esq.;[1] and _David Montague_, Esq.; were their examinants,  and released them. Their kind _master_ also interceded for them; and  was much affected and grieved at their punishment.\" Brother _Hambleton_  was also an advocate for them; and further says, that at one of their  examinations _George Walton_, Esq.; spoke freely in favour of the  sufferers, saying, that such treatment would be condemned even among  barbarians. \"The chief justice _Osborne_ then gave them liberty to  continue their worship between sunrising and sun set; and their  indulgent _master_ told the magistrate, that he would give them the  liberty of his own _house or his barn_, at a place called Brampton,  about three miles from town, and that they should not be interrupted  in their worship. In consequence hereof, they made use of their  masters _barn_, where they had a number of hearers, with little or  no interruption, for about two years. During the time of worship at  Brampton Brother Thomas Burton, an elderly baptist preacher, paid them  a visit, examined and baptized about _eighteen_ blacks: at another period  while there they received a visit from our brother _Abraham Marshall_[2]  who examined and baptized about forty and gave them two certificates  from under his hand;\" copies of which follow:    This is to _certify_, that upon examination into the experiences and  characters of a number of _Ethiopians_, and adjacent to Savannah, it  appears that God has brought them out of darkness into the light of the  Gospel, and given them fellowship one with the other; believing it is  the will of Christ, we have constituted them a church of Jesus Christ,  to keep up his worship and ordinances.    (Signed) A. Marshall, V.D.M.      Jan. 19, 1788.    This is to certify, that the Ethiopian church of Jesus Christ at  Savannah, have called their beloved _Andrew_ to the work of the  ministry. We have examined into his qualifications, and believing it to  be the will of the great Head of the church, we have appointed him to  preach the Gospel, and to administer the ordinances, as God in his  providence may call.    (Signed) A. Marshall, V.D.M.        Jan. 20, 1788.    \"After the death of their master his son, Dr. _William Bryan_,  generously continued them the use of the _barn_ for worship, until the  estate was divided among the family. Our Brother _Andrew_, by consent of  parties, purchased his freedom, bought a lot at Yamacraw, and built a  residence near the dwelling house which their master had given _Sampson_  liberty to build on his lot; and which have ever been made use of for  worship. But by the division of their master's estate, the lot whereon  _Sampson_ had built a house to live in, and which until this time  continues to be used for worship, by _Andrew_, fell into the hands of an  attorney, who married a daughter of the deceased Mr. Bryan, and receives  no less than 12 l. a year for it. _Sampson_ serves as a clerk, but  frequently exhorts in the absence of his brother who has his  appointments in different places to worship.    \"Brother _Andrew's_ account of his number in full communion is TWO  HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE, and about THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY have been  received as converted followers, many of whom have not permission\" from  their owners \"to be baptized.--The whole number is judged to be about  five hundred and seventy-five, from the towns being taken to this  present July. I have consulted brother _Hambleton_, who thinks they have  need of a few Bibles, the Baptist Confession of Faith, and Catechism;  Wilson on Baptism, some of Bunyan's works, or any other that your wisdom  may think useful to an illerate [sic] people. They all join in prayers  for you and yours and beg your intercession at the throne of grace for  them, as well as for the small number of whites that dwell here; and  among them I hope you will not forget your poor unworthy brother, and  believe me, with sincere affections and brotherly love, your in the  bonds of the Gospel,    (Signed) Jonathan Clarke[3]        Concerning the church at Savannah, the late Rev. Mr. Joseph Cook, of the  Euhaw, upper Indian land, thus writes: \"From the enclosed you will see  how it became a church, and what they have suffered, which is extremely  affecting, but they now begin to rise from obscurity and to appear  great. I have some acquaintance with their pastor, and have heard him  preach; his _gifts are small_, but he is _clear in the grand doctrines_  of the Gospel.--I believe him to be _truly pious_ and he has been the  instrument of doing more good among the poor slaves than all the learned  doctors in America.\"    The friends of our adorable Redeemer will, no doubt, rejoice to find  that this large body of Christians negroes, under the patronage of some  of the most respectable persons in their city, \"have opened a  subscription for the erecting of a place of worship in the city of  Savannah, for the society of black people of the Baptist denomination--  the property to be vested in the hands of seven or more persons in trust  for the church and congregation.\"    Their case[4] is sent to England, recommended by       J.

Since the preceding account has been in the press, other letters have been  received, of which the following is an extract.        Kingston, Jamaica, May 18, 1792.    _Rev. and Dear Sir_,    In answer to yours I wrote December 18 last, and as I have not received  a line from you since, I send this, not knowing but the other was  miscarried. Mr. Green has called upon me, and very kindly offered his  service to deliver a letter from me into your hands; he also advised me  to send you a copy of our church covenant, which I have done: being a  collection of some of the principal texts of scripture which we observe,  both in America and this country, for the direction of our practice. It  is read once a month here on sacrament meetings, that our members may  examine if they live according to all those laws which they profess,  covenanted and agreed to; by this means our church is kept in scriptural  subjection. As I observe in my last the chiefest part of our society are  poor illiterate slaves, some living on sugar estates, some on mountains,  pens, and other settlements, that have no learning, no not to know so  much as a letter in the book; but the reading this covenant once a  month, when all are met together from the different parts of the island,  keeps them in mind of the commandments of God.
