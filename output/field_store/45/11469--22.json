Among the crew were the Followers of Horus  of Edfu, who were skilled workers in metal, and each of these had in his  hands an iron spear and a chain. These \"Blacksmiths\" threw out their  chains into the river and allowed the crocodiles and hippopotami to  entangle their legs in them, and then they dragged the beasts towards  the bows of the Boat, and driving their spears into their bodies, slew  them there. After the slaughter the bodies of six hundred and fifty-one  crocodiles were brought and laid out before the town of Edfu. When Thoth  saw these he said, \"Let your hearts rejoice, O gods of heaven, Let your  hearts rejoice, O ye gods who dwell on the earth. The Young Horus cometh  in peace. On his way he hath made manifest deeds of valour, according to  the Book of slaying the Hippopotamus.\" And from that day they made  figures of Horus in metal.    Then Horus of Edfu took the form of the winged disk, and set himself on  the prow of the Boat of Ra. He took with him Nekhebet, goddess of the  South, and Uatchet, goddess of the North, in the form of serpents, so  that they might make all the enemies of the Sun-god to quake in the  South and in the North. His foes who had fled to the north doubled back  towards the south, for they were in deadly fear of the god. Horus  pursued and overtook them, and he and his blacksmiths had in their hands  spears and chains, and they slew large numbers of them to the south-east  of the town of Thebes in Upper Egypt. Many succeeded in escaping towards  the north once more, but after pursuing them for a whole day Horus  overtook them, and made a great slaughter among them. Meanwhile the  other foes of the god, who had heard of the defeats of their allies,  fled into Lower Egypt, and took refuge among the swamps of the Delta.  Horus set out after them, and came up with them, and spent four days in  the water slaying his foes, who tried to escape in the forms of  crocodiles and hippopotami. He captured one hundred and forty-two of the  enemy and a male hippopotamus, and took them to the fore part of the  Boat of Ra. There he hacked them in pieces, and gave their inward parts  to his followers, and their mutilated bodies to the gods and goddesses  who were in the Boat of Ra and on the river banks in the town of Heben.    Then the remnant of the enemy turned their faces towards the Lake of the  North, and they attempted to sail to the Mediterranean in boats; but the  terror of Horus filled their hearts, and they left their boats and fled  to the district of Mertet-Ament, where they joined themselves to the  worshippers of Set, the god of evil, who dwelt in the Western Delta.  Horus pursued them in his boat for one day and one night without seeing  them, and he arrived at the town of Per-Rehui. At length he discovered  the position of the enemy, and he and his followers fell upon them, and  slew a large number of them; he captured three hundred and eighty-one of  them alive, and these he took to the Boat of Ra, then, having slain  them, he gave their carcases to his followers or bodyguard, who  presumably devoured them. The custom of eating the bodies of enemies is  very old in Egypt, and survives in some parts of Africa to this day.    Then Set, the great antagonist of Horus, came out and cursed him for the  slaughter of his people, using most shameful words of abuse. Horus stood  up and fought a duel with Set, the \"Stinking Face,\" as the text calls  him, and Horus succeeded in throwing him to the ground and spearing him.  Horus smashed his mouth with a blow of his mace, and having fettered him  with his chain, he brought him into the presence of Ra, who ordered that  he was to be handed over to Isis and her son Horus, that they might work  their will on him. Here we must note that the ancient editor of the  Legend has confounded Horus the ancient Sun-god with Horus, son of Isis,  son of Osiris. Then Horus, the son of Isis, cut off the heads of Set and  his followers in the presence of Ra, and dragged Set by his feet round  about throughout the district with his spear driven through his head and  back, according to the order of Ra. The form which Horus of Edfu had at  that time was that of a man of great strength, with the face and back of  a hawk; on his head he wore the Double Crown, with feathers and serpents  attached, and in his hands he held a metal spear and a metal chain. And  Horus, the son of Isis, took upon himself a similar form, and the two  Horuses slew all the enemies on the bank of the river to the west of the  town of Per-Rehui. This slaughter took place on the seventh day of the  first month of the season Pert,[1] which was ever afterwards called the  \"Day of the Festival of Sailing.\"    [Footnote 1: About the middle of November.]    Now, although Set in the form of a man had been slain, he reappeared in  the form of a great hissing serpent, and took up his abode in a hole in  the ground without being noticed by Horus. Ra, however, saw him, and  gave orders that Horus, the son of Isis, in the form of a hawk-headed  staff, should set himself at the mouth of the hole, so that the monster  might never reappear among men. This Horus did, and Isis his mother  lived there with him. Once again it became known to Ra that a remnant of  the followers of Set had escaped, and that under the direction of the  Smait fiends, and of Set, who had reappeared, they were hiding in the  swamps of the Eastern Delta. Horus of Edfu, the winged disk, pursued  them, speared them, and finally slew them in the presence of Ra. For the  moment there were no more enemies of Ra to be found in the district on  land, although Horus passed six days and six nights in looking for them;  but it seems that several of the followers of Set in the forms of water  reptiles were lying on the ground under water, and that Horus saw them  there. At this time Horus had strict guard kept over the tomb of Osiris  in Anrutef,[1] because he learned that the Smait fiends wanted to come  and wreck both it and the body of the god. Isis, too, never ceased to  recite spells and incantations in order to keep away her husband's foes  from his body. Meanwhile the \"blacksmiths\" of Horus, who were in charge  of the \"middle regions\" of Egypt, found a body of the enemy, and  attacked them fiercely, slew many of them, and took one hundred and six  of them prisoners. The \"blacksmiths\" of the west also took one hundred  and six prisoners, and both groups of prisoners were slain before Ra. In  return for their services Ra bestowed dwelling-places upon the  \"blacksmiths,\" and allowed them to have temples with images of their  gods in them, and arranged for offerings and libations to be made to  them by properly appointed priests of various classes.    [Footnote 1: A district of Herakleopolis.]    Shortly after these events Ra discovered that a number of his enemies  were still at large, and that they had sailed in boats to the swamps  that lay round about the town of Tchal, or Tchar, better known as Zoan  or Tanis. Once more Horus unmoored the Boat of Ra, and set out against  them; some took refuge in the waters, and others landed and escaped to  the hilly land on the east. For some reason, which is not quite  apparent, Horus took the form of a mighty lion with a man's face, and he  wore on his head the triple crown. His claws were like flints, and he  pursued the enemy on the hills, and chased them hither and thither, and  captured one hundred and forty-two of them. He tore out their tongues,  and ripped their bodies into strips with his claws, and gave them over  to his allies in the mountains, who, no doubt, ate them. This was the  last fight in the north of Egypt, and Ra proposed that they should sail  up the river and return to the south. They had traversed all Egypt, and  sailed over the lakes in the Delta, and down the arms of the Nile to the  Mediterranean, and as no more of the enemy were to be seen the prow of  the boat of Ra was turned southwards. Thoth recited the spells that  produced fair weather, and said the words of power that prevented storms  from rising, and in due course the Boat reached Nubia. When it arrived  Horus found in the country of Uauatet men who were conspiring against  him and cursing him, just as they had at one time blasphemed Ra. Horus,  taking the form of the winged disk, and accompanied by the two  serpent-goddesses, Nekhebet and Uatchet, attacked the rebels, but there  was no fierce fighting this time, for the hearts of the enemy melted  through fear of him. His foes cast themselves before him on the ground  in submission, they offered no resistance, and they died straightway.  Horus then returned to the town of Behutet (Edfu), and the gods  acclaimed him, and praised his prowess. Ra was so pleased with him that  he ordered Thoth to have a winged disk, with a serpent on each side of  it, placed in every temple in Egypt in which he (_i.e._ Ra) was  worshipped, so that it might act as a protector of the building, and  drive away any and every fiend and devil that might wish to attack it.  This is the reason why we find the winged disk, with a serpent on each  side of it, above the doors of temples and religious buildings  throughout the length and breadth of Egypt.    In many places in the text that contains the above Legend there are  short passages in which attempts are made to explain the origins of the  names of certain towns and gods. All these are interpolations in the  narrative made by scribes at a late period of Egyptian history. As it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15950"],[0,"Wilderness Ways (#18)"],[1,". In the morning stillness I could hear the cut  and rip of his claws on the wood. We call the action sharpening the  claws; but it is only the occasional exercise of the fine flexor  muscles that a cat uses so seldom, yet must use powerfully when the  time comes. The second lucivee came out of the shadow a moment later  and leaped upon the fallen tree where he could better watch the  hillside below. For half an hour or more, while I waited expectantly,  both animals moved restlessly about the den, or climbed over the roots  and trunk of the fallen tree. They were plainly cross; they made no  attempt at play, but kept well away from each other with a wholesome  respect for teeth and claws and temper. Breakfast hour was long past,  evidently, and they were hungry.    Suddenly one, who was at that moment watching from the tree trunk,  leaped down; the second joined him, and both paced back and forth  excitedly. They had heard the sounds of a coming that were too fine  for my ears. A stir in the underbrush, and Mother Lynx, a great savage  creature, stalked out proudly. She carried a dead hare gripped across  the middle of the back. The long ears on one side, the long legs on  the other, hung limply, showing a fresh kill. She walked to the  doorway of her den, crossed it back and forth two or three times,  still carrying the hare as if the lust of blood were raging within her  and she could not drop her prey even to her own little ones, which  followed her hungrily, one on either side. Once, as she turned toward  me, one of the kittens seized a leg of the hare and jerked it  savagely. The mother whirled on him, growling deep down in her throat;  the youngster backed away, scared but snarling. At last she flung the  game down. The kittens fell upon it like furies, growling at each  other, as I had seen the stranger lynxes growling once before over the  caribou. In a moment they had torn the carcass apart and were  crouched, each one over his piece, gnarling like a cat over a rat, and  stuffing themselves greedily in utter forgetfulness of the mother  lynx, which lay under a bush some distance away and watched them.    In a half hour the savage meal was over. The little ones sat up,  licked their chops, and began to tongue their broad paws. The mother  had been blinking sleepily; now she rose and came to her young. A  change had come over the family. The kittens ran to meet the dam as if  they had not seen her before, rubbing softly against her legs, or  sitting up to rub their whiskers against hers--a tardy thanks for the  breakfast she had provided. The fierce old mother too seemed  altogether different. She arched her back against the roots, purring  loudly, while the little ones arched and purred against her sides.  Then she bent her savage head and licked them fondly with her tongue,  while they rubbed as close to her as they could get, passing between  her legs as under a bridge, and trying to lick her face in return;  till all their tongues were going at once and the family lay down  together.    It was time to kill them now. The rifle lay ready. But a change had  come over the watcher too. Hitherto he had seen Upweekis as a  ferocious brute, whom it was good to kill. This was altogether  different. Upweekis could be gentle also, it seemed, and give herself  for her little ones. And a bit of tenderness, like that which lay so  unconscious under my eyes, gets hold of a man, and spikes his guns  better than moralizing. So the watcher stole away, making as little  noise as he could, following his compass of twigs to where the canoes  lay ready and Simmo was waiting.    Sometime, I hope, Simmo and I will camp there again, in winter. And  then I shall listen with a new interest for a cry in the night which  tells me that Moktaques the rabbit is hiding close at hand in the  snow, where a young lynx of my acquaintance cannot find him.          VIII. HUKWEEM THE NIGHT VOICE.    [Illustration: Hukweem]      Hukweem the loon must go through the world crying for what he never  gets, and searching for one whom he never finds; for he is the  hunting-dog of Clote Scarpe. So said Simmo to me one night in  explaining why the loon's cry is so wild and sad.    Clote Scarpe, by the way, is the legendary hero, the Hiawatha of the  northern Indians. Long ago he lived on the Wollastook, and ruled the  animals, which all lived peaceably together, understanding each  other's language, and \"nobody ever ate anybody,\" as Simmo says. But  when Clote Scarpe went away they quarreled, and Lhoks the panther and  Nemox the fisher took to killing the other animals. Malsun the wolf  soon followed, and ate all he killed; and Meeko the squirrel, who  always makes all the mischief he can, set even the peaceable animals  by the ears, so that they feared and distrusted each other. Then they  scattered through the big woods, living each one for himself; and now  the strong ones kill the weak, and nobody understands anybody any  more.    There were no dogs in those days. Hukweem was Clote Scarpe's hunting  companion when he hunted the great evil beasts that disturbed the  wilderness; and Hukweem alone, of all the birds and animals, remained  true to his master. For hunting makes strong friendship, says Simmo;  and that is true. Therefore does Hukweem go through the world, looking  for his master and calling him to come back. Over the tree-tops, when  he flies low looking for new waters; high in air, out of sight, on his  southern migrations; and on every lake where he is only a voice, the  sad night voice of the vast solitary unknown wilderness--everywhere  you hear him seeking. Even on the seacoast in winter, where he knows  Clote Scarpe cannot be--for Clote Scarpe hates the sea--Hukweem  forgets himself, and cries occasionally out of pure loneliness.    When I asked what Hukweem says when he cries--for all cries of the  wilderness have their interpretation--Simmo answered: \"Wy, he say two  ting. First he say, _Where are you? O where are you_? Dass what you  call-um his laugh, like he crazy. Denn, wen nobody answer, he say, _O  I so sorry, so sorry_! _Ooooo-eee_! like woman lost in woods. An'  dass his tother cry.\"    [Illustration: Hukweem]    This comes nearer to explaining the wild unearthliness of Hukweem's  call than anything else I know. It makes things much simpler to  understand, when you are camped deep in the wilderness, and the night  falls, and out of the misty darkness under the farther shore comes a  wild shivering call that makes one's nerves tingle till he finds out  about it--_Where are you? O where are you?_ That is just like Hukweem.    Sometimes, however, he varies the cry, and asks very plainly: \"Who are  you? O who are you?\" There was a loon on the Big Squattuk lake, where  I camped one summer, which was full of inquisitiveness as a blue jay.  He lived alone at one end of the lake, while his mate, with her brood  of two, lived at the other end, nine miles away. Every morning and  evening he came close to my camp--very much nearer than is usual, for  loons are wild and shy in the wilderness--to cry out his challenge.  Once, late at night, I flashed a lantern at the end of the old log  that served as a landing for the canoes, where I had heard strange  ripples; and there was Hukweem, examining everything with the greatest  curiosity.    Every unusual thing in our doings made him inquisitive to know all  about it. Once, when I started down the lake with a fair wind, and a  small spruce set up in the bow of my canoe for a sail, he followed me  four or five miles, calling all the way. And when I came back to camp  at twilight with a big bear in the canoe, his shaggy head showing over  the bow, and his legs up over the middle thwart, like a little old  black man with his wrinkled feet on the table, Hukweem's curiosity  could stand it no longer. He swam up within twenty yards, and circled  the canoe half a dozen times, sitting up straight on his tail by a  vigorous use of his wings, stretching his neck like an inquisitive  duck, so as to look into the canoe and see what queer thing I had  brought with me.    He had another curious habit which afforded him unending amusement.  There was a deep bay on the west shore of the lake, with hills rising  abruptly on three sides. The echo here was remarkable; a single shout  brought a dozen distinct answers, and then a confusion of tongues as  the echoes and re-echoes from many hills met and mingled. I discovered  the place in an interesting way.    One evening at twilight, as I was returning to camp from exploring the  upper lake, I heard a wild crying of loons on the west side. There  seemed to be five or six of the great divers, all laughing and  shrieking like so many lunatics. Pushing over to investigate, I  noticed for the first time the entrance to a great bay, and paddled up  cautiously behind a point, so as to surprise the loons at their game.  For they play games, just as crows do. But when I looked in, there was  only one bird, Hukweem the Inquisitive. I knew him instantly by his  great size and beautiful markings. He would give a single sharp call,  and listen intently, with head up, swinging from side to side as the  separate echoes came ringing back from the hills. Then he would try  his cackling laugh, _Ooo-ah-ha-ha-ha-hoo, ooo-ah-ha-ha-ha-hoo_, and as  the echoes began to ring about his head he would get excited, sitting  up on his tail, flapping his wings, cackling and shrieking with glee  at his own performance. Every wild syllable was flung back like a shot  from the surrounding hills, till the air seemed full of loons, all  mingling their crazy cachinnations with the din of the chief  performer. The uproar made one shiver. Then Hukweem would cease  suddenly, listening intently to the warring echoes. Before the  confusion was half ended he would get excited again, and swim about in  small circles, spreading wings and tail, showing his fine feathers as  if every echo were"]]]
