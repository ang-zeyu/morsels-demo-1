Holy men, I have revolved the matter in my mind; but the more I  think of it, the less able am I to recollect that I ever  contracted an alliance with this lady. What answer, then, can I  possibly give you when I do not believe myself to be her husband,  and I plainly see that she is soon to become a mother?    [S']AKOONTALA    [_Aside_.    Woe! woe! Is our very marriage to be called in question by my own  husband? Ah me! is this to be the end of all my bright visions of  wedded happiness?    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Beware!      Beware how thou insult the holy Sage!    Remember how he generously allowed    Thy secret union with his foster-child;    And how, when thou didst rob him of his treasure,    He sought to furnish thee excuse, when rather    He should have cursed thee for a ravisher.    [S']ARADWATA.    [S']arngarava, speak to him no more. [S']akoontala,  our part is performed; we have said all we have to  say, and the King has replied in the manner thou  hast heard. It is now thy turn to give him convincing  evidence of thy marriage.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                            [_Aside_.    Since his feeling towards me has undergone a complete revolution,  what will it avail to revive old recollections? One thing is  clear--I shall soon have to mourn my own widowhood.    [_Aloud_.]    My revered husband--    [_Stops short_.]    But no--I dare not address thee by this title, since thou hast  refused to acknowledge our union. Noble descendant of Puru! It is  not worthy of thee to betray an innocent-minded girl, and disown  her in such terms, after having so lately and so solemnly  plighted thy vows to her in the hermitage.    KING.    [_Stopping his ears_.    I will hear no more. Be such a crime far from my thoughts!      What evil spirit can possess thee, lady,    That thou dost seek to sully my good name    By base aspersions, like a swollen torrent,    That, leaping from its narrow bed, o'erthrows    The tree upon its bank, and strives to blend    Its turbid waters with the crystal stream?    [S']AKOONTALA.    If, then, thou really believest me to be the wife of another, and  thy present conduct proceeds from some cloud that obscures thy  recollection, I will easily convince thee by this token.    KING.    An excellent idea!    [S']AKOONTALA.    [_Feeling for the ring_.    Alas! alas! woe is me! There is no ring on my finger!                                    [_Looks with anguish at_ GAUTAMI.    GAUTAMI.    The ring must have slipped off when thou wast in the act of  offering homage to the holy water of [S']achi's sacred pool, near  Sakravatara[82].    KING.                                                 [_Smiling_.    People may well talk of the readiness of woman's invention! Here  is an instance of it.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Say, rather, of the omnipotence of fate. I will mention another  circumstance, which may yet convince thee.    KING.    By all means let me hear it at once.    [S']AKOONTALA.    One day, while we were seated in a jasmine-bower, thou didst pour  into the hollow of thine hand some water, sprinkled by a recent  shower in the cup of a lotus-blossom--    KING.    I am listening; proceed.    [S']AKOONTALA.    At that instant, my adopted child, the little fawn, with soft,  long eyes, came running towards us. Upon which, before tasting  the water thyself, thou didst kindly offer some to the little  creature, saying fondly:--'Drink first, gentle fawn.' But she  could not be induced to drink from the hand of a stranger; though  immediately afterwards, when I took the water in my own hand,  she drank with perfect confidence. Then, with a smile, thou didst  say;--'Every creature confides naturally in its own kind. You are  both inhabitants of the same forest, and have learnt to trust  each other.'    KING.    Voluptuaries may allow themselves to be seduced from the path of  duty by falsehoods such as these, expressed in honeyed words.    GAUTAMI.    Speak not thus, illustrious Prince. This lady was brought up in a  hermitage, and has never learnt deceit.    KING.    Holy matron,      E'en in untutored brutes, the female sex    Is marked by inborn subtlety--much more    In beings gifted with intelligence.    The wily Koil[83], ere towards the sky    She wings her sportive flight, commits her eggs    To other nests, and artfully consigns    The rearing of her little ones to strangers.    [S']AKOONTALA.                                          [_Angrily_.    Dishonourable man, thou judgest of others by thine own evil  heart. Thou, at least, art unrivalled in perfidy, and standest  alone--a base deceiver in the garb of virtue and religion--like a  deep pit whose yawning mouth is concealed by smiling flowers.    KING.                                                   [_Aside_.    Her anger, at any rate, appears genuine, and makes me almost  doubt whether I am in the right. For indeed,      When I had vainly searched my memory,    And so with stern severity denied    The fabled story of our secret loves,    Her brows, that met before in graceful curves,    Like the arched weapon of the god of love,    Seemed by her frown dissevered; while the fire    Of sudden anger kindled in her eyes.    [_Aloud_.]    My good lady, Dushyanta's character is well known to all. I  comprehend not your meaning.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Well do I deserve to be thought a harlot for having in the  innocence of my heart, and out of the confidence I reposed in a  Prince of Puru's race, entrusted my honour to a man whose mouth  distils honey, while his heart is full of poison.           [_Covers her face with her mantle, and bursts into tears_.    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Thus it is that burning remorse must ever follow rash actions  which might have been avoided, and for which one has only one's  self to blame.      Not hastily should marriage be contracted,    And specially in secret. Many a time,    In hearts that know not each the other's fancies,    Fond love is changed into most bitter hate.    KING.    How now! Do you give credence to this woman rather than to me,  that you heap such accusations on me?    [S']ARNGARAVA.                                    [_Sarcastically_.    That would be too absurd, certainly. You have heard the  proverb:--      Hold in contempt the innocent words of those    Who from their infancy have known no guile;    But trust the treacherous counsels of the man    Who makes a very science of deceit.    KING.    Most veracious Brahman, grant that you are in the right, what end  would be gained by betraying this lady?    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Ruin.    KING.    No one will believe that a Prince of Puru's race would seek to  ruin others or himself.    [S']ARADWATA.    This altercation is idle, [S']arngarava. We have executed the  commission of our preceptor; come, let us return.                                                      [_To the_ KING.      [S']akoontala is certainly thy bride;    Receive her or reject her, she is thine.    Do with her, King, according to thy pleasure--    The husband o'er the wife is absolute.    Go on before us, Gautami.                                                   [_They move away_.    [S']AKOONTALA.    What! is it not enough to have been betrayed by this perfidious  man? Must you also forsake me, regardless of my tears and  lamentations?                                          [_Attempts to follow them_.    GAUTAMI.                                             [_Stopping_.    My son [S']arngarava, see! [S']akoontala is following us, and with  tears implores us not to leave her. Alas! poor child, what will  she do here with a cruel husband who casts her from him?    [S']ARNGARAVA.                                      [_Turning angrily towards her_.    Wilful woman, dost thou seek to be independent of thy lord?                                   [[S']AKOONTALA _trembles with fear_.    [S']akoontala!      If thou art really what the King proclaims thee,    How can thy father e'er receive thee back    Into his house and home? but if thy conscience    Be witness to thy purity of soul,    E'en should thy husband to a handmaid's lot    Condemn thee, thou may'st cheerfully endure it.    When ranked among the number of his household.    Thy duty therefore is to stay. As for us, we must return  immediately.    KING.    Deceive not this lady, my good hermit, by any such expectations.      The moon expands the lotus of the night,    The rising sun awakes the lily; each    Is with his own contented. Even so    The virtuous man is master of his passions,    And from another's wife averts his gaze[120].    [S']ARNGARAVA.    Since thy union with another woman has rendered thee oblivious of  thy marriage with [S']akoontala, whence this fear of losing thy  character for constancy and virtue?    KING.                                  [_To his domestic_ PRIEST.    You must counsel me, revered Sir, as to my course of action.  Which of the two evils involves the greater or less sin?      Whether by some dark veil my mind be clouded.    Or this designing woman speak untruly,    I know not. Tell me, must I rather be    The base disowner of my wedded wife,    Or the defiling and defiled adulterer?    PRIEST.                                    [_After deliberation_.    You must take an intermediate course.    KING.    What course, revered Sir? Tell me at once.    PRIEST.    I will provide an asylum for the lady in my own house until the  birth of her child; and my reason, if you ask me, is this:  Soothsayers have predicted that your first-born will have  universal dominion. Now, if the hermit's daughter bring forth a  son with the discus or mark of empire in the lines of his  hand[84], you must admit her immediately into your royal  apartments with great rejoicings; if not, then determine to send  her back as soon as possible to her father.    KING.  I bow to the decision of my spiritual advisor.    PRIEST.    Daughter, follow me.    [S']AKOONTALA.    O divine earth, open"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#18)"],[1,"won the  case triumphantly.    Was it conceivable that he could make anything of the present case? He  had not declined it. He had certainly entertained it and was probably  thinking it over at this moment. Yet could anything be more impossible?  Here was the case of a man making his own will, probably writing it out  himself, bringing it voluntarily to a certain place and executing it in  the presence of competent witnesses. There was no suggestion of any  compulsion or even influence or persuasion. The testator was admittedly  sane and responsible; and if the will did not give effect to his  wishes--which, however, could not be proved--that was due to his own  carelessness in drafting the will and not to any unusual circumstances.  And the problem--which Thorndyke seemed to be considering--was how to  set aside that will.    I reviewed the statements that I had heard, but turn them about as I  would, I could get nothing out of them but confirmation of Mr.  Marchmont's estimate of the case. One fact that I had noted with some  curiosity I again considered; that was Thorndyke's evident desire to  inspect Jeffrey Blackmore's chambers. He had, it is true, shown no  eagerness, but I had seen at the time that the questions which he put to  Stephen were put, not with any expectation of eliciting information but  for the purpose of getting an opportunity to look over the rooms  himself.    I was still cogitating on the subject when my colleague returned,  followed by the watchful Polton with the tea-tray, and I attacked him  forthwith.    \"Well, Thorndyke,\" I said, \"I have been thinking about this Blackmore  case while you have been gadding about.\"    \"And may I take it that the problem is solved?\"    \"No, I'm hanged if you may. I can make nothing of it.\"    \"Then you are in much the same position as I am.\"    \"But, if you can make nothing of it, why did you undertake it?\"    \"I only undertook to think about it,\" said Thorndyke. \"I never reject a  case off-hand unless it is obviously fishy. It is surprising how  difficulties, and even impossibilities, dwindle if you look at them  attentively. My experience has taught me that the most unlikely case is,  at least, worth thinking over.\"    \"By the way, why do you want to look over Jeffrey's chambers? What do  you expect to find there?\"    \"I have no expectations at all. I am simply looking for stray facts.\"    \"And all those questions that you asked Stephen Blackmore; had you  nothing in your mind--no definite purpose?\"    \"No purpose beyond getting to know as much about the case as I can.\"    \"But,\" I exclaimed, \"do you mean that you are going to examine those  rooms without any definite object at all?\"    \"I wouldn't say that,\" replied Thorndyke. \"This is a legal case. Let me  put an analogous medical case as being more within your present sphere.  Supposing that a man should consult you, say, about a progressive loss  of weight. He can give no explanation. He has no pain, no discomfort, no  symptoms of any kind; in short, he feels perfectly well in every  respect; <i>but</i> he is losing weight continuously. What would you do?\"    \"I should overhaul him thoroughly,\" I answered.    \"Why? What would you expect to find?\"    \"I don't know that I should start by expecting to find anything in  particular. But I should overhaul him organ by organ and function by  function, and if I could find nothing abnormal I should have to give it  up.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Thorndyke. \"And that is just my position and my line of  action. Here is a case which is perfectly regular and straightforward  excepting in one respect. It has a single abnormal feature. And for that  abnormality there is nothing to account.    \"Jeffrey Blackmore made a will. It was a well-drawn will and it  apparently gave full effect to his intentions. Then he revoked that will  and made another. No change had occurred in his circumstances or in his  intentions. The provisions of the new will were believed by him to be  identical with those of the old one. The new will differed from the old  one only in having a defect in the drafting from which the first will  was free, and of which he must have been unaware. Now why did he revoke  the first will and replace it with another which he believed to be  identical in its provisions? There is no answer to that question. It is  an abnormal feature in the case. There must be some explanation of that  abnormality and it is my business to discover it. But the facts in my  possession yield no such explanation. Therefore it is my purpose to  search for new facts which may give me a starting-point for an  investigation.\"    This exposition of Thorndyke's proposed conduct of the case, reasonable  as it was, did not impress me as very convincing. I found myself coming  back to Marchmont's position, that there was really nothing in dispute.  But other matters claimed our attention at the moment, and it was not  until after dinner that my colleague reverted to the subject.    \"How should you like to take a turn round to New Inn this evening?\" he  asked.    \"I should have thought,\" said I, \"that it would be better to go by  daylight. Those old chambers are not usually very well illuminated.\"    \"That is well thought of,\" said Thorndyke. \"We had better take a lamp  with us. Let us go up to the laboratory and get one from Polton.\"    \"There is no need to do that,\" said I. \"The pocket-lamp that you lent me  is in my overcoat pocket. I put it there to return it to you.\"    \"Did you have occasion to use it?\" he asked.    \"Yes. I paid another visit to the mysterious house and carried out your  plan. I must tell you about it later.\"    \"Do. I shall be keenly interested to hear all about your adventures. Is  there plenty of candle left in the lamp?\"    \"Oh yes. I only used it for about an hour.\"    \"Then let us be off,\" said Thorndyke; and we accordingly set forth on  our quest; and, as we went, I reflected once more on the apparent  vagueness of our proceedings. Presently I reopened the subject with  Thorndyke.    \"I can't imagine,\" said I, \"that you have absolutely nothing in view.  That you are going to this place with no defined purpose whatever.\"    \"I did not say exactly that,\" replied Thorndyke. \"I said that I was not  going to look for any particular thing or fact. I am going in the hope  that I may observe something that may start a new train of speculation.  But that is not all. You know that an investigation follows a certain  logical course. It begins with the observation of the conspicuous facts.  We have done that. The facts were supplied by Marchmont. The next stage  is to propose to oneself one or more provisional explanations or  hypotheses. We have done that, too--or, at least I have, and I suppose  you have.\"    \"I haven't,\" said I. \"There is Jeffrey's will, but why he should have  made the change I cannot form the foggiest idea. But I should like to  hear your provisional theories on the subject.\"    \"You won't hear them at present. They are mere wild conjectures. But to  resume: what do we do next?\"    \"Go to New Inn and rake over the deceased gentleman's apartments.\"    Thorndyke smilingly ignored my answer and continued--    \"We examine each explanation in turn and see what follows from it;  whether it agrees with all the facts and leads to the discovery of new  ones, or, on the other hand, disagrees with some facts or leads us to an  absurdity. Let us take a simple example.    \"Suppose we find scattered over a field a number of largish masses of  stone, which are entirely different in character from the rocks found in  the neighbourhood. The question arises, how did those stones get into  that field? Three explanations are proposed. One: that they are the  products of former volcanic action; two: that they were brought from a  distance by human agency; three: that they were carried thither from  some distant country by icebergs. Now each of those explanations  involves certain consequences. If the stones are volcanic, then they  were once in a state of fusion. But we find that they are unaltered  limestone and contain fossils. Then they are not volcanic. If they were  borne by icebergs, then they were once part of a glacier and some of  them will probably show the flat surfaces with parallel scratches which  are found on glacier-borne stones. We examine them and find the  characteristic scratched surfaces. Then they have probably been brought  to this place by icebergs. But this does not exclude human agency, for  they might have been brought by men to this place from some other where  the icebergs had deposited them. A further comparison with other facts  would be needed.    \"So we proceed in cases like this present one. Of the facts that are  known to us we invent certain explanations. From each of those  explanations we deduce consequences; and if those consequences agree  with new facts, they confirm the explanation, whereas if they disagree  they tend to disprove it. But here we are at our destination.\"    We turned out of Wych Street into the arched passage leading into New  Inn, and, halting at the half-door of the lodge, perceived a stout,  purple-faced man crouching over the fire, coughing violently. He held up  his hand to intimate that he was fully occupied for the moment, and we  accordingly waited for his paroxysm to subside. At length he turned  towards us, wiping his eyes, and inquired our business.    \"Mr. Stephen Blackmore,\" said Thorndyke, \"has given me permission to  look over his chambers. He said that he would mention the matter to  you.\"    \"So he has, sir,\" said the porter; \"but he has just taken the key  himself to go to the chambers. If you walk across the Inn you'll find  him there; it's on the farther side; number thirty-one, second floor.\"    We made our way across to the house indicated, the ground floor of which  was occupied by a solicitor's offices and was distinguished by a  good-sized brass plate.
