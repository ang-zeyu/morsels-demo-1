Now that you found out that he  is your son you come and take all my things in Kabinbinlan, as soon  as the _Balaua_ is finished. As soon as you will get all of them I  will fly somewhere.\" So when the people went home, after the _Balaua_  was finished, Lingiwan and Dangdangayan went to follow their _alan_  mothers. As soon as they arrived in the different places where the  _alan_ lived they gave them all the things which they had and they  used their power so that all the things went to their town. When  all the things arrived in Kadalayapan the people in the town were  frightened, for there was a golden house. When the things arrived  in Kaodanan the people were frightened for there were the valuable  things which Dangdangayan took with him.    After one month passed Lingiwan said to his father Pagatipanan,  \"You go and make _pakalon_ for Aponibolinayen for I want to marry  her.\" So his father sent his wife Langa-an to Kaodanan to tell to  the father and mother of Aponibolinayen that Lingiwan wished to marry  her. So Langa-an took her hat which looked like the Salaksak [172] and  her new skirt. As soon as she dressed she started and went. When she  arrived in Kaodanan Pagbokasan was lying down in his _balaua_. \"Good  morning,\" she said to him. Pagbokasan was a in hurry to sit up and  he said to her, \"I am glad to see you, what are you coming here  for in the middle of the day.\" \"What am I coming for you say? I am  coming to see if you want Lingiwan for a son for he wishes to marry  Aponibolinayen.\" Pagbokasan took her to his house and said to his wife,  \"Here is cousin Langa-an who came to see us.\" So Ebang told him that  he should get some old _basi_ for them to drink.    As soon as they drank Ebang went to cook. As soon as she finished  cooking they ate. After they finished eating they took the big coconut  shell and filled it with _basi_ and each of them drank, and they  were all drunk, and Langa-an said, \"I like to hear from you if you  wish Lingiwan to be a son.\" Soon Pagbokasan and Ebang agreed. They  decided on the day for _pakalon_. So Langa-an went home and when she  arrived she laid down on the porch of the house for she was drunk,  and Lingiwan saw her and waked her. \"What is the matter with you?\" he  said. \"I am drunk for Pagbokasan and Ebang urged me to drink much  _basi_, so I was scarcely able to get home, that is why I slept  on the porch.\" \"Mother, you go into the house, do not sleep on the  porch.\" So she went in and Lingiwan asked her the result of her visit  to Kaodanan. \"They accepted you and we agreed to make _pakalon_ the  day after tomorrow.\" So Lingiwan was glad, and went to tell the people  about his marriage, and all the people prepared so that they might go.    As soon as the agreed day came they went to Kaodanan and they took many  pigs and _basi_ jars. When they arrived there Pagbokasan, who was the  father of Aponibolinayen, and the other people were already there and  had cooked many caldrons of rice and meat. Pagbokasan took the _gansa_  [173] and he commanded someone to play and they danced. After that  they ate. As soon as they finished to eat they played the _gansa_  again and they danced. Iwaginan of Pindayan said, \"Stop playing  the _gansas_ we are going to settle on how much they must pay for  Aponibolinayen. As soon as we agree we will dance.\" And the people  were quiet and they agreed how much Lingiwan was to pay. The father  and mother of Lingiwan offered the _balaua_ three times full of jars  which are _malayo_ and _tadogan_ and _ginlasan._ [174] The people  did not agree and they said, \"Five times full, if you do not have  that many Lingiwan may not marry Aponibolinayen.\" He was so anxious  to marry her that he told his parents to agree to what the people  said. As soon as they agreed Langa-an used magic so that all the jars  which the people wanted were already in the _balaua_--five times  full. As soon as they gave all the jars which they paid, Iwaginan  ordered them to play the gansas and they danced. After they danced,  all their relatives who went to attend _pakalon_ were anxious to go  home for they had been there one month. \"Do not detain us, for we are  one month here.\" So Pagbokasan let them go. Everyone carried home some  jars and they all went home. [175] So Pagatipanan said to Pagbokasan,  \"Now that the _pakalon_ is over we will take Aponibolinayen, because  Lingiwan wants her now.\" Pagbokasan said, \"Do not take her now. You  come and bring Lingiwan day after tomorrow.\" \"If that is what you  say we will bring him, if you will not let us take Aponibolinayen now.\"    When they started to go home Pagbokasan said to them, \"Dangdangayan  wants to marry Aponigawani who is your daughter.\" \"You will wait  until next month,\" said Langa-an. \"After Aponibolinayen and Lingiwan  are married, we will think first.\" Not long after the day on which  they agreed to take Lingiwan to Aponibolinayen came, and he carried  one jar. [176] As soon as they arrived there they made the rice  ceremony. [177] When the ceremony was over Pagatipanan and Langa-an  and the others went home and left Lingiwan.    As soon as they arrived in Kadalayapan Langa-an asked Aponigawani if  she wanted Dangdangayan to be her husband. Aponigawani said, \"If you  think it is good for me to be married now, and you think he is a good  man for my husband it is all right, for he has magical power like  us.\" As soon as the agreed month passed the parents of Dangdangayan  came to ask if they wished the marriage. They prepared a number of  _basi_ jars for them to drink from when they should arrive. When  they arrived there Pagatipanan was prepared and he met them with the  _basi_ and they all drank. After that they told all the people who  lived in their town that they were going to celebrate the arrival  of Pagbokasan and his companions. \"Ala, we do not stay long now,  _Abalayan_, [178] we want to know if you wish Dangdangayan to be  married to Aponigawani. We will have a good time during _pakalon_,\"  they said. After that Langa-an and Pagatipanan said, \"Now the meal is  ready. We are going to eat first and after that you will hear what  we say.\" And Pagbokasan and Ebang did not wish to eat for they were  in a hurry and only went to hear if they wished Dangdangayan to be  the husband of Aponigawani. \"If you do not wish to come and eat with  us, we do not want Dangdangayan to be married to Aponigawani,\" they  said. Then they all went to eat. After they ate, \"Ala now that we  have finished eating you excuse us, for we want to know if you wish  Dangdangayan to be married to Aponigawani.\" Langa-an and Pagatipanan  said, \"You will come next month, we will make _pakalon_.\" So they went  home and Dangdangayan went to meet them at the gate of the town, and  he asked at once, \"Father and mother did they accept me?\" He said,  \"Yes, if we can agree on what they want us to pay, and we have to  go there next month.\" So Dangdangayan was glad and told the people  about it, and he invited them to go the next month to make _pakalon_.    As soon as the agreed month to go to Kadalayanpan came, they went. As  soon as they arrived there they danced for one month. Lingiwan and  Aponibolinayen had their golden house, which the _alan_ had given  them. The people agreed on how much they should pay for the _pakalon_,  and Pagatipanan and Langa-an said, \"Pay just the same as we paid for  Aponibolinayen when Lingiwan married her.\" \"If that is what you say, it  is all right,\" they said. And Ebang used magic so that the _balaua_ was  five times full of jars which are _malayo, tadogan_, and _ginlasan._  So the _balaua_ was filled five times, and each of the relatives who  went to attend the _pakalon_ took some jars. As soon as the _pakalon_  was finished the people all went home, and Pagbokasan and Ebang said,  \"Ala, now that the _pakalon_ is over let us take Aponigawani,\" Langa-an  answered, \"If you make extra payment you can take Aponigawani now,\"  and Dangdangayan said to his mother, \"If they want the extra payment,  ask them how much.\" Langa-an replied, \"Another five times the _balaua_  full,\" and Ebang said to her son, \"We have to pay again the _balaua_  five times full.\" \"That is all right mother I have many jars which  my _alan_ mother gave me,\" so they gave the extra jars which they  asked. As soon as they gave all the jars they took Aponigawani of  Kaodanan with them. As soon as they arrived they made a big party, and  they invited the _alan_. As soon as the _alan_ arrived at the party  they danced and gave more presents to them. After that the _alan_  and the other people went home and Aponigawani and Dangdangayan had  their own house which the _alan_ gave them. This is all.    (Told by Lagmani of Patok.)        7    Aponitolau told Aponibolinayen that they would go to the river to wash  their hair. Not long after Aponibolinayen went with him. When they  arrived at the spring they washed their hair. As soon as they washed  their hair they went to get the _lawed_ [179] vine and they went back  home. As soon as they reached home Aponitolau said to Aponibolinayen,  \"Will you comb my hair? I am anxious to go to fight.\" So Aponibolinayen  combed his hair. As soon as she combed it he said, \"Ala, you go and  get my clout, my belt which is sewed with gold, and my striped coat,  and also get my _ambosau_.\" [180] Aponibolinayen got them and Aponitolau  dressed up. As soon as he was dressed he took his shield, his headaxe,  and spear, and went. He struck the side of his shield, and it sounded  like one hundred people. While he was walking and striking his shield  in the middle of the way, Gimbagonan, the wife of Iwaginan, heard him,  when he was near to Pindayan. When he passed by the town he continued  toward the town of Giambolan. In a short time he arrived at the well  of Giambolan. He met the young girls who were dipping water from  the well.

The town and fortifications are both built on a tongue of  land washed by the sea.    May 27th.    During the night we reached Caesarea.  With the eloquence of a  Demosthenes, our captain endeavoured to dissuade us from our project  of landing here; he pointed out to us the dangers to which we were  exposing ourselves, and the risks we should run from Bedouins and  snakes.  The former, he averred, were accustomed to conceal  themselves in hordes among the ruins, in order to ease travellers of  their effects and money; being well aware that such spots were only  visited by curious tourists with well-filled purses, they were  continually on the watch, like the robber-knights of the good old  German empire.  \"An enemy no less formidable,\" said the captain,  \"was to be encountered in the persons of numerous snakes lurking in  the old walls and on the weed-covered ground, which endangered the  life of the traveller at every step.\"  We were perfectly well aware  of these facts, having gleaned them partly from descriptions of  voyages, partly from oral traditions; and so they were not powerful  enough to arrest our curiosity.  The captain himself was really less  actuated by the sense of our danger, in advising us to abandon our  undertaking, than by the reflection of the time it lost him; but he  exerted himself in vain.  He was obliged to cast anchor, and at  daybreak to send a boat ashore with us.    Our arms consisted of parasols and sticks (the latter we carried in  order to beat the bushes); we were escorted by the captain, his  servant, and a couple of sailors.    In the ruins we certainly met with a few suspicious-looking  characters in the shape of wandering Bedouins.  As it was too late  to beat a retreat, we advanced bravely towards them with trusting  and friendly looks.  The Bedouins did the same, and so there was an  end of this dangerous affair.  We climbed from one fragment to  another, and certainly spent more than two hours among the ruins,  without sustaining the slightest injury at the hands of these  people.  Of the threatened snakes we saw not a single one.    Ruins, indeed, we found every where in plenty.  Whole side-walls,  which appeared to have belonged to private houses, but not to  splendid palaces or temples, stood erect and almost unscathed.  Fragments of pillars lay scattered about in great abundance, but  without capitals, pedestals, or friezes.    It was with a feeling of awe hitherto unknown to me that I trod the  ground where my Redeemer had walked.  Every spot, every building  became invested with a double interest.  \"Perchance,\" I thought, \"I  may be lingering within the very house where Jesus once sojourned.\"  More than satisfied with my excursion, I returned to our bark.    By three o'clock in the afternoon we were close under the walls of  Joppa.  To enter this harbour, partially choked up as it is with  sand, is described as a difficult feat.  We were assured that we  should see many wrecks of stranded ships and boats; accordingly I  strained my eyes to the utmost, and could discover nothing.  We ran  safely in; and thus ended a little journey in the course of which I  had seen many new and interesting objects, besides gaining some  insight into the mode of life among the sailors.  Frequently, when  it fell calm, our Arabs would recline on the ground in a circle,  singing songs of an inconceivably inharmonious and lugubrious  character, while they clapped their hands in cadence, and burst at  intervals into a barking laugh.  I could not find any thing very  amusing in this entertainment; on the contrary, it had the effect of  making me feel very melancholy, as displaying these good people in a  very idiotic and degrading light.    The costume of the sailors was simple in the extreme.  A shirt  covered them in rather an imperfect manner, and a handkerchief bound  round their heads protected them from a coup de soleil.  The captain  was distinguished from the rest only by his turban, which looked  ridiculous enough, surmounting his half-clad form.  Their diet  consisted of a single warm meal of pilau or beans, eaten in the  evening.  During the day they stayed their appetites with bread.  Their drink was water.    The town of Joppa, extending from the sea-shore to the summit of a  rather considerable and completely isolated hill, has a most  peculiar appearance.  The lower street is surrounded by a wall, and  appears sufficiently broad; the remaining streets run up the face of  the hills, and seem at a distance to be resting on the houses below.  Viewing the town from our boat, I could have sworn that people were  walking about on flat house-tops.    As Joppa boasts neither an inn nor a convent which might shelter a  traveller, I waited upon the Consul of the Austrian Empire, Herr D---,  who received me very kindly and introduced me to his family,  which comprised his lady, three sons, and three daughters.  They  wore the Turkish costume.  The daughters, two of whom were  exceedingly beautiful, wore wide trousers, a caftan, and a sash  round the waist.  On their heads they had little fez-caps, and their  hair was divided into fifteen or twenty narrow plaits, interwoven  with little gold coins, and a larger one at the end of each plait.  A necklace of gold coins encircled their necks.  The mother was  dressed in exactly the same way.  When elderly women have little or  no hair left, they make up with artificial silk plaits for the  deficiencies of nature.    The custom of wearing coins as ornaments is so prevalent throughout  Syria, that the very poorest women, girls, and children strive to  display as many as possible.  Where they cannot sport gold, they  content themselves with silver money; and where even this metal is  not attainable, with little coins of copper and other baser metals.    The Consul and his son were also clothed in the Turkish garb; but  instead of a turban the father wore an old cocked hat, which gave  him an indescribably ludicrous appearance.  A son and a daughter of  this worthy patron of the semi-Turkish, semi-European garb, had but  one eye, a defect frequently met with in Syria.  It is generally  supposed to be caused by the dry heat, the fine particles of sand,  and the intense glare of the chalky hills.    As I reached Joppa early in the afternoon, I proceeded in company of  the Consul to view the town and its environs.  In dirt, bad paving,  etc., I found it equal to any of the towns I had yet seen.  The  lower street, near the sea, alone is broad and bustling, with loaded  and unloaded camels passing continually to and fro.  The bazaar is  composed of some miserable booths containing common provisions and a  few cheap wares.    The neighbourhood of Joppa is exceedingly fertile.  Numerous large  gardens, with trees laden with all kinds of tropical fruits, and  guarded by impenetrable hedges of the Indian fig-tree, form a half-  circle round the lower portion of the town.    The Indian fig-tree, which I here saw for the first time, has an odd  appearance.  From its stem, which is very dwarfish, leaves a foot in  length, six inches in breadth, and half an inch in thickness, shoot  forth.  This tree seldom sends forth branches; the leaves grow one  out of another, and at the extremity the fruit is formed.  Its  length is about two or three inches.  Ten or twenty such figs are  frequently found adhering to a single leaf.    I could not conceive how it happened that in these hot countries,  without rain to refresh them, the trees all looked so healthy and  beautiful.  This fact, I found, was owing to the numerous channels  cut through the gardens, which are thus artificially irrigated.  The  heavy dews and cool nights also tend to restore the drooping  vegetation.  One great ornament of our gardens was, however, totally  wanting--a lawn with wild flowers.  Trees and vegetables here grow  out of the sandy or stony earth, a circumstance hardly noticed at a  distance, but which produces a disagreeable effect on a near view.  Flowers I found none.    The whole region round Joppa is so covered with sand, that one sinks  ankle-deep at every step.    Consul D--- fulfils the duties of two consulates, the Austrian and  the French.  From both these offices he derives no benefit but the  honour.  By some people this honour would be highly valued, but many  would rate it at nothing at all.  This family, however, seems to  have a great idea of honour; for the consul's office is hereditary,  and I found the son of the present dignitary already looking forward  to filling his place.    In the evening I was present at a real Oriental entertainment in the  house of this friendly family.    Mats, carpets, and pillows were spread out on the terrace of the  house, and a very low table placed in the centre.  Round this the  family sat, or rather reclined, cross-legged.  I was accommodated  with a chair somewhat higher than the table.  Beside my plate and  that of the Consul were laid a knife and fork, that appeared to have  been hunted out from some lumber closet; the rest ate with a species  of natural knife and fork, namely--fingers.    The dishes were not at all to my taste.  I had still too much of the  European about me, and too little appetite, to be able to endure  what these good people seemed to consider immense delicacies.    The first dish appeared in the form of a delicate pilau, composed of  mutton, cucumbers, and a quantity of spice, which rendered it more  unpalatable to me than common pilau.  Then followed sliced cucumbers  sprinkled with salt; but as the chief ingredients, vinegar and oil,  were entirely wanting, I was obliged to force down the cucumber as  best I could.  Next came rice-milk, so strongly flavoured with attar  of roses, that the smell alone was more than enough for me; and now  at length the last course was put on the table--stale cheese made of  ewe's milk, little unpeeled"]]]
