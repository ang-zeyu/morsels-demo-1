[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11615"],[0,"The Grammar of English Grammars (#18)"],[1,"what I have elsewhere said about the duties of a modern  grammarian. \"As for the diversitie of grammars, it is well and profitably  taken awaie by the King's Majesties wisdome; who, foreseeing the  inconvenience, and favorably providing the remedie, caused one kind of  grammar by sundry learned men to be diligently drawn, and so to be set out,  only every where to be taught, for the use of learners, and for the hurt in  changing of schoolemaisters.\" That is, to prevent the injury which  schoolmasters were doing by a whimsical choice, or frequent changing, of  grammars. But, says the letter, \"The varietie of teaching is divers yet,  and alwaies will be; for that every schoolemaister liketh that he knoweth,  and seeth not the use of that he knoweth not; and therefore judgeth that  the most sufficient waie, which he seeth to be the readiest meane, and  perfectest kinde, to bring a learner to have a thorough knowledge therein.\"  The only remedy for such an evil then is, to teach those who are to be  teachers, and to desert all who, for any whim of their own, desert sound  doctrine.    6. But, to return. A law was made in England by Henry the Eighth,  commanding Lily's Grammar only, (or that which has commonly been quoted as  Lily's,) to be everywhere adopted and taught, as the common standard of  grammatical instruction.[7] Being long kept in force by means of a special  inquiry, directed to be made by the bishops at their stated visitations,  this law, for three hundred years, imposed the book on all the established  schools of the realm. Yet it is certain, that about one half of what has  thus gone under the name of Lily, (\"because,\" says one of the patentees,  \"he had _so considerable a hand_ in the composition,\") was written by Dr.  Colet, by Erasmus, or by others who improved the work after Lily's death.  And of the other half, it has been incidentally asserted in history, that  neither the scheme nor the text was original. The Printer's Grammar,  London, 1787, speaking of the art of type-foundery, says: \"The Italians in  a short time brought it to _that_ perfection, that in the beginning of the  year 1474, they cast a letter not much inferior to the best types of the  present age; as may be seen in a Latin Grammar, written by Omnibonus  Leonicenus, and printed at Padua on the 14th of January, 1474; _from whom  our grammarian, Lily, has taken the entire scheme of his Grammar, and  transcribed the greatest part thereof, without paying any regard to the  memory of this author_.\" The historian then proceeds to speak about types.  See also the same thing in the History of Printing, 8vo, London, 1770. This  is the grammar which bears upon its title page: \"_Quam solam Regia Majestas  in omnibus scholis docendam prcaecipit_.\"    7. Murray was an intelligent and very worthy man, to whose various labours  in the compilation of books our schools are under many obligations. But in  original thought and critical skill he fell far below most of \"the authors  to whom,\" he confesses, \"the grammatical part of his compilation is  _principally indebted for its materials_; namely, Harris, Johnson, Lowth,  Priestley, Beattie, Sheridan, Walker, Coote, Blair, and  Campbell.\"--_Introd. to Lindley Murray's Gram._, p. 7. It is certain and  evident that he entered upon his task with a very insufficient preparation.  His biography, which was commenced by himself and completed by one of his  most partial friends, informs us, that, \"Grammar did not particularly  engage his attention, until a short time previous to the publication of his  first work on that subject;\" that, \"His Grammar, as it appeared in the  first edition, was completed in rather less than a year;\" that, \"It was  begun in the spring of 1794, and published in the spring of 1795--though he  had an intervening illness, which, for several weeks, stopped the progress  of the work;\" and that, \"The Exercises and Key were also composed in about  a year.\"--_Life of L. Murray_, p. 188. From the very first sentence of his  book, it appears that he entertained but a low and most erroneous idea of  the duties of that sort of character in which he was about to come before  the public.[8] He improperly imagined, as many others have done, that  \"little can be expected\" from a modern grammarian, or (as he chose to  express it) \"from a _new compilation_, besides a careful selection of the  most useful matter, and some degree of improvement in the mode of adapting  it to the understanding, and the gradual progress of learners.\"--_Introd.  to L. Murray's Gram._; 8vo, p. 5; 12mo, p. 3. As if, to be master of his  own art--to think and write well himself, were no part of a grammarian's  business! And again, as if the jewels of scholarship, thus carefully  selected, could need a burnish or a foil from other hands than those which  fashioned them!    8. Murray's general idea of the doctrines of grammar was judicious. He  attempted no broad innovation on what had been previously taught; for he  had neither the vanity to suppose he could give currency to novelties, nor  the folly to waste his time in labours utterly nugatory. By turning his own  abilities to their best account, he seems to have done much to promote and  facilitate the study of our language. But his notion of grammatical  authorship, cuts off from it all pretence to literary merit, for the sake  of doing good; and, taken in any other sense than as a forced apology for  his own assumptions, his language on this point is highly injurious towards  the very authors whom he copied. To justify himself, he ungenerously places  them, in common with others, under a degrading necessity which no able  grammarian ever felt, and which every man of genius or learning must  repudiate. If none of our older grammars disprove his assertion, it is time  to have a new one that will; for, to expect the perfection of grammar from  him who cannot treat the subject in a style at once original and pure, is  absurd. He says, \"The greater part of an English grammar _must necessarily  be a compilation _;\" and adds, with reference to his own, \"originality  belongs to but a small portion of it. This I have acknowledged; and I trust  _this acknowledgement_ will protect me from all attacks, grounded on any  supposed unjust and irregular assumptions.\" This quotation is from a letter  addressed by Murray to his American publishers, in 1811, after they had  informed him of certain complaints respecting the liberties which he had  taken in his work. See \"_The Friend_,\" Vol. iii, p. 34.    9. The acknowledgement on which he thus relies, does not appear to have  been made, till his grammar had gone through several editions. It was,  however, at some period, introduced into his short preface, or  \"Introduction,\" in the following well-meant but singularly sophistical  terms: \"In _a work_ which professes itself to be a _compilation_, and  which, _from the nature and design of it_, must consist chiefly of  materials selected from the writings of others, _it is scarcely necessary  to apologise_ for the use which the Compiler has made of his predecessors'  labours, or for _omitting to insert_ their names. _From the alterations_  which have been frequently made in the sentiments and the language, to suit  the connexion, and to adapt them to the particular purposes for which they  are introduced; and, in many instances, _from the uncertainty to whom_ the  passages originally belonged, the insertion of names _could seldom be made  with propriety_. But if this could have been generally done, a work of this  nature _would derive no advantage from it_, equal to the inconvenience of  crowding the pages with a repetition of names and references. It is.  however, proper to acknowledge, in general terms, that the authors to whom  the grammatical part of this compilation is principally indebted for its  materials, are Harris, Johnson, Lowth, Priestley, Beattie, Sheridan,  Walker, and Coote.\"--_Introd.; Duodecimo Gram._, p. 4; _Octavo_, p. 7.    10. The fallacy, or absurdity, of this language sprung from necessity. An  impossible case was to be made out. For compilation, though ever so fair,  is not grammatical authorship. But some of the commenders of Murray have  not only professed themselves satisfied with this general acknowledgement,  but have found in it a candour and a liberality, a modesty and a  diffidence, which, as they allege, ought to protect him from all  animadversion. Are they friends to learning? Let them calmly consider what  I reluctantly offer for its defence and promotion. In one of the  recommendations appended to Murray's grammars, it _is_ said, \"They have  nearly superseded every thing else of the kind, by concentrating the  remarks of the best authors on the subject.\" But, in truth, with several  of the best English grammars published previously to his own, Murray  appears to have been totally unacquainted. The chief, if not the only  school grammars which were largely copied by him, were Lowth's and  Priestley's, though others perhaps may have shared the fate of these in  being \"superseded\" by his. It may be seen by inspection, that in copying  these two authors, the compiler, agreeably to what he says above, omitted  all names and references--even such as they had scrupulously inserted: and,  at the outset, assumed to be himself the sole authority for all his  doctrines and illustrations; satisfying his own mind with making, some  years afterwards, that general apology which we are now criticising. For if  he so mutilated and altered the passages which he adopted, as to make it  improper to add the names of their authors, upon what other authority than  his own do they rest? But if, on the other hand, he generally copied  without alteration; his examples are still anonymous, while his first  reason for leaving them so, is plainly destroyed: because his position is  thus far contradicted by the fact.    11. In his later editions, however, there are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11620"],[0,"My Brilliant Career (#18)"],[1," felt certain as I watched  him that he had quite forgotten the incident of the little girl with the  lemons.        \"Sybylla, hurry up and get dressed. Put on your best bib and tucker, and  I will leave Harry Beecham in your charge, as I want to superintend the  making of some of the dishes myself this evening.\"    \"It's too early to put on my evening dress, isn't it, auntie?    \"It is rather early; but you can't spare time to change twice. Dress  yourself completely; you don't know what minute your uncle and his  worship will arrive.\"    I had taken a dip in the creek, so had not to bathe, and it took me but  a short time to don full war-paint--blue evening dress, satin slippers,  and all. I wore my hair flowing, simply tied with a ribbon. I slipped  out into the passage and called aunt Helen. She came.    \"I'm ready, auntie. Where is he?\"    \"In the dining-room.\"    \"Come into the drawing-room and call him. I will take charge of him till  you are at leisure. But, auntie, it will be a long time till dinner--how  on earth will I manage him?\"    \"Manage him!\" she laughed; \"he is not at all an obstreperous character.\"    We had reached the drawing-room by this, and I looked at myself in the  looking-glass while aunt Helen went to summon Harold Augustus Beecham,  bachelor, owner of Five-Bob Downs, Wyambeet, Wallerawang West,  Quat-Quatta, and a couple more stations in New South Wales, besides an  extensive one in Queensland.    I noticed as he entered the door that since I had seen him he had  washed, combed his stiff black hair, and divested himself of his hat,  spurs, and whip--his leggings had perforce to remain, as his nether  garment was a pair of closely fitting grey cloth riding-breeches, which  clearly defined the shapely contour of his lower limbs.    \"Harry, this is Sybylla. I'm sure you need no further introduction.  Excuse me, I have something on the fire which is likely to burn.\" And  aunt Helen hurried off leaving us facing each other.    He stared down at me with undisguised surprise. I looked up at him and  laughed merrily. The fun was all on my side. He was a great big  man--rich and important. I was a chit--an insignificant nonentity--yet,  despite his sex, size, and importance, I was complete master of that  situation, and knew it: thus I laughed.    I saw that he recognized me again by the dusky red he flushed beneath  his sun-darkened skin. No doubt he regretted having called me a filly  above all things. He bowed stiffly, but I held out my hand, saying:    \"Do shake hands. When introduced I always shake hands with anyone I  think I'll like. Besides, I seem to know you well. Just think of all the  apples you brought me!\"    He acceded to my request, holding my hand a deal longer than necessary,  and looking at me helplessly. It amused me greatly, for I saw that it  was he who did not know how to manage me, and not I that couldn't manage  him.    \"'Pon my honour, Miss Melvyn, I had no idea it was you, when I said--\"  Here he boggled completely, which had the effect of reviving my  laughter.    \"You had no right to be dressed like that--deceiving a fellow. It wasn't  fair.\"    \"That's the best of it. It shows what a larrikin Don Juan sort of  character you are. You can't deceive me now if you pretend to be a  virtuous well-behaved member of society.\"    \"That is the first time I've ever meddled with any of the kitchen fry,  and, by Jove, it will be the last!\" he said energetically. \"I've got  myself into a pretty mess.\"    \"What nonsense you talk,\" I replied. \"If you say another word about it,  I'll write a full account of it and paste it in my scrapbook. But if you  don't worry about it, neither will I. You said nothing very  uncomplimentary; in fact, I was quite flattered.\"    I was perched on the high end of a couch, and he was leaning with big  careless ease on the piano. Had grannie seen me, I would have been  lectured about unladylike behaviour.      \"What is your uncle at today?\" he inquired.    \"He's not at anything. He went to Gool-Gool yesterday on the jury. Court  finishes up today, and he is going to bring the judge home tonight.  That's why I am dressed so carefully,\" I answered.    \"Good gracious! I never thought of court this time as I wasn't called on  the jury, and for a wonder hadn't so much as a case against a Chinaman.  I was going to stay tonight, but can't if his worship is going to dine  here.\"    \"Why? You're surely not afraid of Judge Fossilt? He's a very simple old  customer.\"    \"Imagine dining with a judge in this toggery!\" and he glanced down his  great figure at his riding gear.    \"That doesn't matter; he's near-sighted. I'll get you put at the far end  of the table under my wing. Men don't notice dress. If you weren't so  big uncle or Frank Hawden could oblige you.\"    \"Do you think I could pass muster?\"    \"Yes; after I brush you down you'll look as spruce as a brass penny.    \"I did brush myself,\" he answered.    \"You brush yourself!\" I retorted. \"There's a big splash of mud on your  shoulder. You couldn't expect to do anything decently, for you're only a  man, and men are the uselessest, good-for-nothingest, clumsiest animals  in the world. All they're good for is to smoke and swear.\"    I fetched a clothes brush.    \"You'll have to stand on the table to reach me,\" he said, looking down  with amused indulgence.    \"As you are so impertinent you can go dusty,\" and I tossed the brush  away.    The evening was balmy, so I invited him into the garden. He threw his  handkerchief over my chest, saying I might catch cold, but I scouted the  idea.    We wandered into an arbour covered with wistaria, banksia, and Marechal  Niel roses, and I made him a buttonhole.    A traveller pulled rein in the roadway, and, dismounting, threw his  bridle over a paling of the garden fence while he went inside to try and  buy a loaf of bread.    I jumped up, frightening the horse so that it broke away, pulling off  the paling in the bridle-rein. I ran to bring a hammer to repair the  damage. Mr Beecham caught the horse while I attempted to drive the nail  into the fence. It was a futile attempt. I bruised my fingers. He took  the hammer from me, and fixing the paling in its place with a couple of  well-aimed blows, said laughingly:    \"You drive a nail! You couldn't expect to do anything. You're only a  girl. Girls are the helplessest, uselessest, troublesomest little  creatures in the world. All they're good for is to torment and pester a  fellow.\"    I had to laugh.    At this juncture we heard uncle Jay-Jay's voice, so Mr Beecham went  towards the back, whence it proceeded, after he left me at the front  door.    \"Oh, auntie, we got on splendidly! He's not a bit of trouble. We're as  chummy as though we had been reared together,\" I exclaimed.    \"Did you get him to talk?\"    \"Oh yes.\"    \"Did you really?\" in surprise.    When I came to review the matter I was forced to confess that I had done  all the talking, and young Beecham the listening; moreover I described  him as the quietest man I had ever seen or heard of.    The judge did not come home with uncle Jay-Jay as expected so it was not  necessary for me to shelter Harold Beecham under my wing. Grannie  greeted him cordially as \"Harold, my boy\", he was a great favourite with  her. She and uncle Julius monopolized him for the evening. There was  great talk of trucking sheep, the bad outlook as regarded the season,  the state of the grass in the triangle, the Leigh Spring, the Bimbalong,  and several other paddocks, and of the condition of the London wool  market. It did not interest me, so I dived into a book, only  occasionally emerging therefrom to smile at Mr Beecham.    He had come to Caddagat for a pair of bullocks which had been fattening  in grannie's home paddock. Uncle gave him a start with them next  morning. When they came out on the road I was standing in a bed of  violets in a tangled corner of the garden, where roses climbed to kiss  the lilacs, and spiraea stooped to rest upon the wallflowers, and where  two tall kurrajongs stood like sentries over all. Harold Beecham  dismounted, and, leaning over the fence, lingered with me, leaving the  bullocks to uncle Jay-Jay. Uncle raved vigorously. Women, he asserted,  were the bane of society and the ruination of all men; but he had always  considered Harold as too sensible to neglect his business to stand  grinning at a pesky youngster in short skirts and a pigtail. Which was  the greatest idiot of the two he didn't know.    His grumbling did not affect Harold in the least.    \"Complimentary to both of us,\" he remarked as he leisurely threw himself  across his great horse, and smiled his pleasant quiet smile, disclosing  two rows of magnificent teeth, untainted by contamination with beer or  tobacco. Raising his panama hat with the green fly-veil around it, he  cantered off. I wondered as I watched him if anything ever disturbed his  serenity, and desired to try. He looked too big and quiet to be ruffled  by such emotions as rage, worry, jealousy, or even love. Returning to  the house, I put aunt Helen through an exhaustive catechism concerning  him.    _Question._ Auntie, what age is Harold Beecham?    _Answer._ Twenty-five last December.    _Q._ Did he ever have any brothers or sisters?    _A._ No. His birth caused his mother's death. Q. How long has his father  been dead?    _A._ Since Harold could crawl.    _Q._ Who reared him?    A. His aunts.    _Q._ Does he ever talk any more than that? A. Often a great deal less.    _Q._ Is he really very rich?    _A._ If he manages to pull through these seasons he will be second to  none but Tyson in point of wealth.    _Q._ Is Five-Bob a very pretty place?    _A._ Yes; one of the show places of the district. Q. Does he often come  to Caddagat?    _A._ Yes, he often drops in.    _Q._ What makes his hair so black and his moustache that light colour?    A. You'll have to study science to find that out. I'm sure I can't tell"]]]
