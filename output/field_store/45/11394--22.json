Although his pay varies according to whether the tributaries of the  river are full or low, so making the moving of the logs easy or  difficult, he can earn about three pounds ten shillings a month,  paid in cash. Compared with the eighty cents a month paid only a few  miles away in the Congo Free State, and in \"trade\" goods, these are  good wages. When the log is shaped the mark of the trader is branded  on it with an iron, just as we brand cattle, and it is turned loose  on the river. At the mouth of the river there is little danger of  the log escaping, for the waves are stronger than the tide, and  drive the logs upon the shore. There, in the surf, we found these  tons of mahogany pounding against each other. In the ship's  steam-launch were iron chains, a hundred yards long, to which, at  intervals, were fastened \"dogs,\" or spikes. These spikes were driven  into the end of a log, the brand upon the log was noted by the  captain and trader, and the logs, chained together like the vertebrae  of a great sea serpent, were towed to the ship's side. There they  were made fast, and three Kroo boys knocked the spike out of each  log, warped a chain around it, and made fast that chain to the steel  hawser of the winch. As it was drawn to the deck a Senegalese  soldier, acting for the Customs, gave it a second blow with a  branding hammer, and, thundering and smashing, it swung into the  hold.     [Illustration: There, in the Surf, We Found These Tons of Mahogany,   Pounding Against Each Other.]    In the \"round up\" of the logs the star performers were the three  Kroo boys at the ship's side. For days, in fascinated horror, the  six passengers watched them, prayed for them, and made bets as to  which would be the first to die. One understands that a Kroo boy is  as much at home in the sea as on shore, but these boys were neither  in the sea nor on shore. They were balancing themselves on blocks of  slippery wood that weighed a ton, but which were hurled about by the  great waves as though they were life-belts. All night the hammering  of the logs made the ship echo like a monster drum, and all day  without an instant's pause each log reared and pitched, spun like a  barrel, dived like a porpoise, or, broadside, battered itself  against the iron plates. But, no matter what tricks it played, a  Kroo boy rode it as easily as though it were a horse in a  merry-go-round.    It was a wonderful exhibition. It furnished all the thrills that one  gets when watching a cowboy on a bucking bronco, or a trained seal.  Again and again a log, in wicked conspiracy with another log, would  plan to entice a Kroo boy between them, and smash him. At the sight  the passengers would shriek a warning, the boy would dive between  the logs, and a mass of twelve hundred pounds of mahogany would  crash against a mass weighing fifteen hundred with a report like  colliding freight cars.    And then, as, breathless, we waited to see what once was a Kroo boy  float to the surface, he would appear sputtering and grinning, and  saying to us as clearly as a Kroo smile can say it: \"He never  touched me!\"     [Illustration: A Log of Mahogany Jammed in the Anchor Chains.]    Two days after we had stored away the mahogany we anchored off  Duala, the capital of the German Cameroons. Duala is built upon a  high cliff, and from the water the white and yellow buildings with  many pillars gave it the appearance of a city. Instead, it is a  clean, pretty town. With the German habit of order, it has been laid  out like barracks, but with many gardens, well-kept, shaded streets,  and high, cool houses, scientifically planned to meet the  necessities of the tropics. At Duala the white traders and officials  were plump and cheerful looking, and in the air there was more of  prosperity than fever. The black and white sentry boxes and the  native soldiers practising the stork march of the Kaiser's army were  signs of a rigid military rule, but the signs of Germany's efforts  in trade were more conspicuous. Nowhere on the coast did we see as  at Duala such gorgeous offices as those of the great trading house  of Woermann, the hated rivals of \"Sir Alfred,\" such carved  furniture, such shining brass railings, and nowhere else did we see  plate-glass windows, in which, with unceasing wonder, the natives  stared at reflections of their own persons. In the river there was a  private dry dock of the Woermanns, and along the wharfs for acres  was lumber for the Woermanns, boxes of trade goods, puncheons and  casks for the Woermanns, private cooper shops and private machine  shops and private banks for the Woermanns. The house flag of the  Woermanns became as significant as that of a reigning sovereign. One  felt inclined to salute it.    The success of the German merchant on the East Coast and over all  the world appears to be a question of character. He is patient,  methodical, painstaking; it is his habit of industry that is helping  him to close port after port to English, French, and American goods.  The German clerks do not go to the East Coast or to China and South  America to drink absinthe or whiskey, or to play dominoes or  cricket. They work twice as long as do the other white men, and  during those longer office hours they toil twice as hard. One of our  passengers was a German agent returning for his vacation. I used to  work in the smoking-room and he always was at the next table, also  at work, on his ledgers and account books. He was so industrious  that he bored me, and one day I asked him why, instead of spoiling  his vacation with work, he had not balanced his books before he left  the Coast.    \"It is an error,\" he said; \"I can not find him.\" And he explained  that in the record of his three years' stewardship, which he was to  turn over to the directors in Berlin, there was somewhere a mistake  of a sixpence.    \"But,\" I protested, \"what's sixpence to you? You drink champagne all  day. You begin at nine in the morning!\"    \"I drink champagne,\" said the clerk, \"because for three years I have  myself alone in the bush lived, but, can I to my directors go with a  book not balanced?\" He laid his hand upon his heart and shook his  head. \"It is my heart that tells me 'No!'\"    After three weeks he gave a shout, his face blushed with pleasure,  and actual tears were in his eyes. He had dug out the error, and at  once he celebrated the recovery of the single sixpence by giving me  twenty-four shillings' worth of champagne. It is a true story, and  illustrates, I think, the training and method of the German mind, of  the industry of the merchants who are trading over all the seas. As  a rule the \"trade\" goods \"made in Germany\" are \"shoddy.\" They do not  compare in quality with those of England or the States; in every  foreign port you will find that the English linen is the best, that  the American agricultural implements, American hardware, saws, axes,  machetes, are superior to those manufactured in any other country.  But the German, though his goods are poorer, cuts the coat to please  the customer. He studies the wishes of the man who is to pay. He is  not the one who says: \"Take it, or leave it.\"    The agent of one of the largest English firms on the Ivory Coast,  one that started by trading in slaves, said to me: \"Our largest  shipment to this coast is gin. This is a French colony, and if the  French traders and I were patriots instead of merchants we would  buy from our own people, but we buy from the Germans, because trade  follows no flag. They make a gin out of potatoes colored with rum or  gin, and label it 'Demerara' and 'Jamaica.' They sell it to us on  the wharf at Antwerp for ninepence a gallon, and we sell it at nine  francs per dozen bottles. Germany is taking our trade from us  because she undersells us, and because her merchants don't wait for  trade to come to them, but go after it. Before the Woermann boat is  due their agent here will come to my factory and spy out all I have  in my compound. 'Why don't you ship those logs with us?' he'll ask.    \"'Can't spare the boys to carry them to the beach,' I'll say.    \"'I'll furnish the boys,' he'll answer. That's the German way.    \"The Elder-Dempster boats lie three miles out at sea and blow a  whistle at us. They act as though by carrying our freight they were  doing us a favor. These German ships, to save you the long pull,  anchor close to the beach and lend you their own shore boats and  their own boys to work your cargo. And if you give them a few tons  to carry, like as not they'll 'dash' you to a case of 'fizz.' And  meanwhile the English captain is lying outside the bar tooting his  whistle and wanting to know if you think he's going to run his ship  aground for a few bags of rotten kernels. And he can't see, and the  people at home can't see, why the Germans are crowding us off the  Coast.\"    Just outside of Duala, in the native village of Bell Town, is the  palace and the harem of the ruler of the tribe that gave its name to  the country, Mango Bell, King of the Cameroons. His brother, Prince  William, sells photographs and \"souvenirs.\" We bought photographs,  and on the strength of that hinted at a presentation at court.  Brother William seemed doubtful, so we bought enough postal cards to  establish us as _etrangers de distinction_, and he sent up our  names. With Pivani, Hatton & Cookson's chief clerk we were escorted  to the royal presence. The palace is a fantastic, pagoda-like  building of three stories; and furnished with many mirrors, carved  oak sideboards, and lamp-shades of colored glass. Mango Bell, King  of the Cameroons, sounds like a character in a comic opera, but the  king was an extremely serious, tall, handsome, and self-respecting  negro. Having been educated in England, he spoke much more correct  English than any of us. Of the few \"Kings I Have Met,\" both tame and  wild, his manners were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#18)"],[1," jewel by wearing it,\" he said. Timon  gave the diamond to a lord called Sempronius, and the lord exclaimed,  \"O, he's the very soul of bounty.\" \"Timon is infinitely dear to me,\"  said another lord, called Lucullus, to whom he gave a beautiful horse;  and other Athenians paid him compliments as sweet.    But when Apemantus had listened to some of them, he said, \"I'm going to  knock out an honest Athenian's brains.\"    \"You will die for that,\" said Timon.    \"Then I shall die for doing nothing,\" said Apemantus. And now you know  what a joke was like four hundred years before Christ.    This Apernantus was a frank despiser of mankind, but a healthy one,  because he was not unhappy. In this mixed world anyone with a number  of acquaintances knows a person who talks bitterly of men, but does not  shun them, and boasts that he is never deceived by their fine speeches,  and is inwardly cheerful and proud. Apemantus was a man like that.    Timon, you will be surprised to hear, became much worse than Apemantus,  after the dawning of a day which we call Quarter Day.    Quarter Day is the day when bills pour in. The grocer, the butcher, and  the baker are all thinking of their debtors on that day, and the wise  man has saved enough money to be ready for them. But Timon had not; and  he did not only owe money for food. He owed it for jewels and horses and  furniture; and, worst of all, he owed it to money-lenders, who expected  him to pay twice as much as he had borrowed.    Quarter Day is a day when promises to pay are scorned, and on that day  Timon was asked for a large sum of money. \"Sell some land,\" he said  to his steward. \"You have no land,\" was the reply. \"Nonsense! I had a  hundred, thousand acres,\" said Timon. \"You could have spent the price of  the world if you had possessed it,\" said Flavius.    \"Borrow some then,\" said Timon; \"try Ventidius.\" He thought of Ventidius  because he had once got Ventidius out of prison by paying a creditor of  this young man. Ventidius was now rich. Timon trusted in his gratitude.  But not for all; so much did he owe! Servants were despatched with  requests for loans of money to several friends:    One servant (Flaminius) went to Lucullus. When he was announced Lucullus  said, \"A gift, I warrant. I dreamt of a silver jug and basin last  night.\" Then, changing his tone, \"How is that honorable, free-hearted,  perfect gentleman, your master, eh?\"    \"Well in health, sir,\" replied Flaminius.    \"And what have you got there under your cloak?\" asked Lucullus,  jovially.    \"Faith, sir, nothing but an empty box, which, on my master's behalf, I  beg you to fill with money, sir.\"    \"La! la! la!\" said Lucullus, who could not pretend to mean, \"Ha! ha!  ha!\" \"Your master's one fault is that he is too fond of giving parties.  I've warned him that it was expensive. Now, look here, Flaminius, you  know this is no time to lend money without security, so suppose you  act like a good boy and tell him that I was not at home. Here's three  solidares for yourself.\"    \"Back, wretched money,\" cried Flaminius, \"to him who worships you!\"    Others of Timon's friends were tried and found stingy. Amongst them was  Sempronius.    \"Hum,\" he said to Timon's servant, \"has he asked Ventidius? Ventidius is  beholden to him.\"    \"He refused.\"    \"Well, have you asked Lucullus?\"    \"He refused.\"    \"A poor compliment to apply to me last of all,\" said Sempronius, in  affected anger. \"If he had sent to me at first, I would gladly have lent  him money, but I'm not going to be such a fool as to lend him any now.\"    \"Your lordship makes a good villain,\" said the servant.    When Timon found that his friends were so mean, he took advantage of  a lull in his storm of creditors to invite Ventidius and Company to a  banquet. Flavius was horrified, but Ventidius and Company, were not in  the least ashamed, and they assembled accordingly in Timon's house, and  said to one another that their princely host had been jesting with them.    \"I had to put off an important engagement in order to come here,\" said  Lucullus; \"but who could refuse Timon?\"    \"It was a real grief to me to be without ready money when he asked for  some,\" said Sempronius.    \"The same here,\" chimed in a third lord.    Timon now appeared, and his guests vied with one another in apologies  and compliments. Inwardly sneering, Timon was gracious to them all.    In the banqueting ball was a table resplendent with covered dishes.  Mouths watered. These summer-friends loved good food.    \"Be seated, worthy friends,\" said Timon. He then prayed aloud to the  gods of Greece. \"Give each man enough,\" he said, \"for if you, who are  our gods, were to borrow of men they would cease to adore you. Let men  love the joint more than the host. Let every score of guests contain  twenty villains. Bless my friends as much as they have blessed me.  Uncover the dishes, dogs, and lap!\"    The hungry lords were too much surprised by this speech to resent it.  They thought Timon was unwell, and, although he had called them dogs,  they uncovered the dishes.    There was nothing in them but warm water.    \"May you never see a better feast,\" wished Timon \"I wash off the  flatteries with which you plastered me and sprinkle you with your  villainy.\" With these words he threw the water into his guests' faces,  and then he pelted them with the dishes. Having thus ended the banquet,  he went into an outhouse, seized a spade, and quitted Athens for ever.    His next dwelling was a cave near the sea.    Of all his friends, the only one who had not refused him aid was a  handsome soldier named Alcibiades, and he had not been asked because,  having quarreled with the Government of Athens, he had left that town.  The thought that Alcibiades might have proved a true friend did not  soften Timon's bitter feeling. He was too weak-minded to discern  the fact that good cannot be far from evil in this mixed world. He  determined to see nothing better in all mankind than the ingratitude of  Ventidius and the meanness of Lucullus.    He became a vegetarian, and talked pages to himself as he dug in the  earth for food.    One day, when he was digging for roots near the shore, his spade struck  gold. If he had been a wise man he would have enriched himself quickly,  and returned to Athens to live in comfort. But the sight of the gold  vein gave no joy but only scorn to Timon. \"This yellow slave,\" he said,  \"will make and break religions. It will make black white and foul fair.  It will buy murder and bless the accursed.\"    He was still ranting when Alcibiades, now an enemy of Athens, approached  with his soldiers and two beautiful women who cared for nothing but  pleasure.    Timon was so changed by his bad thoughts and rough life that Alcibiades  did not recognize him at first.    \"Who are you?\" he asked.    \"A beast, as you are,\" was the reply.    Alcibiades knew his voice, and offered him help and money. But Timon  would none of it, and began to insult the women. They, however, when  they found he had discovered a gold mine, cared not a jot for his  opinion of them, but said, \"Give us some gold, good Timon. Have you  more?\"    With further insults, Timon filled their aprons with gold ore.    \"Farewell,\" said Alcibiades, who deemed that Timon's wits were lost; and  then his disciplined soldiers left without profit the mine which could  have paid their wages, and marched towards Athens.    Timon continued to dig and curse, and affected great delight when he dug  up a root and discovered that it was not a grape.    Just then Apemantus appeared. \"I am told that you imitate me,\" said  Apemantus. \"Only,\" said Timon, \"because you haven't a dog which I can  imitate.\"    \"You are revenging yourself on your friends by punishing yourself,\" said  Apemantus. \"That is very silly, for they live just as comfortably as  they ever did. I am sorry that a fool should imitate me.\"    \"If I were like you,\" said Timon, \"I should throw myself away.\"    \"You have done so,\" sneered Apemantus. \"Will the cold brook make you a  good morning drink, or an east wind warm your clothes as a valet would?\"    \"Off with you!\" said Timon; but Apemantus stayed a while longer and told  him he had a passion for extremes, which was true. Apemantus even made a  pun, but there was no good laughter to be got out of Timon.    Finally, they lost their temper like two schoolboys, and Timon said he  was sorry to lose the stone which he flung at Apemantus, who left him  with an evil wish.    This was almost an \"at home\" day for Timon, for when Apemantus had  departed, he was visited by some robbers. They wanted gold.    \"You want too much,\" said Timon. \"Here are water, roots and berries.\"    \"We are not birds and pigs,\" said a robber.    \"No, you are cannibals,\" said Timon. \"Take the gold, then, and may it  poison you! Henceforth rob one another.\"    He spoke so frightfully to them that, though they went away with full  pockets, they almost repented of their trade. His last visitor on that  day of visits was his good steward Flavius. \"My dearest master!\" cried  he.    \"Away! What are you?\" said Timon.    \"Have you forgotten me, sir?\" asked Flavius, mournfully.    \"I have forgotten all men,\" was the reply; \"and if you'll allow that you  are a man, I have forgotten you.\"    \"I was your honest servant,\" said Flavius.    \"Nonsense! I never had an honest man about me,\" retorted Timon.    Flavius began to cry.    \"What! shedding tears?\" said Timon. \"Come nearer, then. I will love you  because you are a woman, and unlike men, who only weep when they laugh  or beg.\"    They talked awhile; then Timon said, \"Yon gold is mine. I will make you  rich, Flavius, if you promise me to live by yourself and hate mankind.  I will make you very rich if you promise me that you will see the flesh  slide off the beggar's bones before you feed him, and let the debtor die  in jail before you pay his debt.\"    Flavius simply said, \"Let me stay to comfort you, my master.\"  "]]]
