A certain Celt  who saw this would not endure it, but taking pity on him cried: \"I will  help you, as well as I can alone.\" Then he wounded Vitellius and killed  himself. However, Vitellius did not die of the wound but was haled to the  prison, as were also his statues, while many amusing and many disgraceful  remarks were made about them. Finally, grieved to the heart at the way he  had been treated and what he was compelled to hear, he was heard to  exclaim: \"Yet I was once your emperor!\" At that the soldiers flew into a  rage and took him to the top of the Scalae Gemoniae, where they struck him  down. His head was cut off and carried about all over the city.    [Sidenote:--22--] Subsequently his wife saw to his burial. He had lived  fifty-four years [and eighty-nine days] and had reigned for a year lacking  ten days. His brother had started from Tarracina to come to his  assistance, but learned while _en route_ that he was dead. He also  encountered a detachment of men sent against him and made terms with them  on condition that his life should be spared. In spite of this he was  murdered not long afterward. The son of Vitellius, too, perished soon  after his father, notwithstanding that Vitellius had killed no relative  either of Otho or of Vespasian. After all these various events had taken  place, Mucianus came up and administered necessary details in conjunction  with Domitian, whom he also presented to the soldiers and had him make a  speech, boy though he was. Each of the soldiers received twenty-five  denarii.          DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY  66    Vespasian is made Emperor: is also designated as such by portents (chapter  1).

(A.D. 81 = a.u. 834  = Third of Titus, to September 13th).      [Sidenote: A.D. 70 (a.u. 823)] [Sidenote:--1--] Such was the course of  events on the heels of which Vespasian was declared emperor by the senate  and Titus and Domitian were given the title of Caesars. The consular  office was assumed by Vespasian and Titus while the former was in Egypt  and the latter in Palestine. Vespasian had seen portents and dreams that  long beforehand indicated that he was destined to rule. As he was eating  dinner in the country, where most of his time was spent, a cow approached  him, knelt down, and put her head beneath his feet. Another time, when he  was taking food, a dog threw a human hand under the table. And a  conspicuous cypress tree, which had been uprooted and overthrown by a  violent wind, on the next day stood upright again by its own power and  continued to flourish. From a dream he learned that when Nero Caesar  should lose a tooth, he should be emperor: and this matter of the tooth  became a reality on the following day. Nero himself in his slumbers  thought he was bringing the chariot of Jupiter to Vespasian's house. These  occurrences, of course, needed interpretation. But in addition a Jew named  Josephus, who had previously been disliked by him and imprisoned, gave a  laugh and said: \"You may imprison me now, but a year later when you become  emperor you will release me.\"    [Sidenote:--2--] Thus had Vespasian, like some others, been born for the  position. While he was as yet absent in Egypt Mucianus administered all  the details of government with the help of Domitian. Mucianus feeling that  he had himself given the sovereignty to Vespasian exulted greatly at these  facts above all,--that he was called \"brother\" by him, and that he had  authority to decide every question that he liked without the emperor's  express approval and could issue written orders by merely adding his  superior's name. For this purpose, too, he wore a finger ring that had  been sent him, which was intended to impress the imperial seal upon  documents requiring authorization. [Indeed, Domitian himself gave offices  and procuratorships to many persons, appointing prefect after prefect and  even consuls.] In fine, they behaved in every way so much like absolute  rulers that Vespasian once sent the following message to Domitian: \"I  thank you, my child, for letting me hold office and that you have not yet  dethroned me.\"    Now Mucianus gathered into the public treasury from every possible quarter  vast sums of money, showing an entire readiness to relieve Vespasian of  the censure which such a proceeding caused. He was forever declaring that  money was the sinews of sovereignty; and in accordance with this belief he  was constantly urging Vespasian to obtain funds from every quarter, and  for his own part he continued from the outset to collect revenue, thus  providing a large amount of money for the empire and acquiring a large  amount himself.    [Sidenote:--3--] In Germany various uprisings against the Romans took  place which are not worth mentioning for my purposes, but there was one  incident that must cause us surprise. A certain Julius Sabinus, one of the  foremost of the Lingones, collected by his own efforts a separate force  and took the name of Caesar, declaring that he was a descendant of Julius  Caesar. He was defeated in several engagements, whereupon he fled to a  field and plunged into a subterranean vault beneath a monument, which he  first burned to the ground. His pursuers thought he had perished in the  conflagration, but as a matter of fact he hid himself there with his wife  for nine years and had two male children by her. The troubles in Germany  were settled by Cerialis in the course of a number of battles, in one of  which so great a multitude of Romans and barbarians both were slain that  the river flowing near by was held back by the bodies of the fallen.  Domitian stood in fear of his father because of what he did and still more  because of what he intended, for his plans were on no small scale. He  happened to be spending most of his time near the Alban Mount, devoting  himself to his passion for Domitia, the daughter of Corbulo. Her he took  away from her husband, Lucius Lamia Aelianus, and at this time he had her  for one of his mistresses, but later he actually married her.    [Sidenote:--4--] Titus, who was assigned to take charge of the war with  the Jews, [undertook to win them over by certain conferences and offers;  as they would not yield, he proceeded to direct hostilities. The first  battles he fought were rather close; finally he prevailed and took up the  siege of Jerusalem. This town had three walls including that surrounding  the temple. The Romans accordingly heaped up mounds against the  fortifications and brought their engines to bear: then collecting in a  dense force they repulsed all sallying parties and with their slings and  arrows kept back all the defenders of the wall. Many persons that had been  sent by some of the barbarian kings they kept prisoners. The Jews who came  to the assistance of their countrymen were many of them from the immediate  region and many from kindred districts, not only in this same Roman empire  but from beyond the Euphrates, and they, too, kept directing missiles and  stones with considerable force on account of the higher ground, some being  flung from the hand and some hurled by means of engines. They likewise  made night and day sallies as often as occasion offered, set fire to the  engines, slew numerous combatants, and by digging out under the wall took  away earth from beneath the mound. As for the rams, they lassoed some of  them and broke the ends off, others they seized and pulled up with hooks,  while by means of thick boards well fastened together and strengthened  with iron, which they let down against the face of the wall, they turned  aside the assaults of the remainder. The Romans' chief cause of discomfort  was the lack of water; their supply was of poor quality and had to be  brought from a distance.    The Jews found their underground passages a source of strength. They had  these affairs dug from within the city out under the walls to distant  points in the country, and going out through them they would "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10891"],[0,"Algonquin Indian Tales (#18)"],[1,"the stripes remain in his back to this day.    \"Well, when he was healed enough to get around again he visited the abodes  of the human race and was very sorry to find that the diseases sent by the  other angry animals were causing much suffering and many deaths, so he  revealed the whole thing to a number of men and told them to be on their  guard. But even this was not sufficient. It was felt that, now that these  diseases were spreading among them, they must have some remedies for the  cure of them or they would all soon be destroyed.    \"While thus wondering what they should do their little friend the ground  squirrel came to their help again. He went about among the trees and  plants, who were always friendly to man, and he told them of the sad  calamities that had come to the human race.    \"When the trees and plants heard what had been done by the animals to  injure and destroy their friends they speedily held councils among  themselves and resolved that they would do all they could to overcome the  evil.    \"First the great trees held their councils, talked over the matter, and  decided what they could do in the way of furnishing remedies to cure these  diseases that were doing so much injury. The pine and the spruce and the  balsam trees said, 'We will give of our gums and balsams.' The slippery elm  said it would give of its bark to make the soothing healing drink. The  sassafras said it would give of its roots to make the healthful tea that  will bring back health again. The prickly ash and the sumach and others  volunteered their help, and spoke of the wonderful healing power there was  in them, if rightly used.    \"When the plants came to their council the numbers that wanted to help were  very great. No one was able to keep a record of them and of the healing  powers they professed to have. There was the mandrake, with its May apples,  and the wintergreen, with its pretty red berries; the catnip and the  bone-set, which are so good for colds; the lobelia, which is such a quick  emetic; the spikenard, the peppermint, the snakeroot, sarsaparilla,  gentian, wild ginger, raspberry, and scores of others. All cheerfully  offered assistance.    \"When the ground squirrel, who had for days been attending the council of  the trees and plants, had made out his list of what remedies each tree and  plant could furnish he was very much delighted, and then, thanking them for  their offered assistance, he rapidly returned to the abodes of mankind and  informed them of his great success.    \"Of course they were very much pleased, and very grateful to the ground  squirrel for his kindness and his interest in their happiness. This is the  reason why the chipmunk, or ground squirrel, lives near the homes of men.  You never see an Indian shoot them or the boys or girls try to snare them.  They are always welcome among the trees and the wigwams. The Indians love  them because they spoke up for man when the other animals turned against  him, and because it was one of their ancestors that made the trees and  plants reveal their good medicines for the cure of the sick.\"    \"Now I know why it was, when I was out with the Indian boys, that they  never would shoot an arrow at a chipmunk, even when I asked them to,\" said  Sagastao.    \"Yes,\" said Mary, \"all of the Indians have heard their fathers tell of the  kindness of the old father chipmunk in the days when the animals knew so  much and could talk, and so they warn the children against injuring these  pretty little creatures.\"    But it was now time they were returning. The light canoe was once more  pushed down into the lake, and soon they were merrily gliding along over  the clear, transparent waters to their cozy home.          CHAPTER XIII.      In the Wigwam of Souwanas--How Gray Wolf Persecuted  Waubenoo, and How He was Punished by Nanahboozhoo.    \"We have come to-day for a nice story about Nanahboozhoo,\" said Minnehaha,  as she and Sagastao lifted the deerskin door at the wigwam of Souwanas, and  entered with all the assurance of children who knew they were welcome.    \"Did he ever do anything to punish bad fellows who were cruel to their  wives and children?\" asked Sagastao. \"Because, if he did, I wish he would  come and thrash old Wakoo, that bad fellow who has been thrashing his wife  again because he said she did not snare enough rabbits to suit him.\"    Souwanas, who was one of the kind-hearted Indians, never cruel to any of  his family, was much amused at the fire and indignation with which the  young lad spoke. So after he had had comfortable seats arranged for the  children among the robes and blankets he endeavored to satisfy their  demands. \"Nanahboozhoo,\" he said, \"did such things long ago, but once,  when he was giving a good thrashing to a man who had been very cruel to his  wife, the wife, as soon as she was able, sprang up from the place where her  husband had knocked her to, seized a paddle and attacked Nanahboozhoo with  such fury that he resolved never to interfere again, if he could help it,  in a quarrel between man and wife. And,\" added the old man, with a merry  twinkle in his eye, \"it is best for everybody, if possible, to keep out of  such quarrels.\"    \"Yes, but, mismis\" (grandfather, Minnehaha's pet name for Souwanas), \"you  surely know a nice story in which Nanahboozhoo helped some one without  getting into trouble himself.\"    \"Of course I do, my grandchild,\" said the old man, \"and I know you will be  pleased with it.    \"My story is about a lovely Indian maiden who was bothered by a cruel  hunter. He was determined that she should marry him, although she did not  like him, and Nanahboozhoo came to her rescue.    \"The maiden's name was Waubenoo. She had the misfortune to lose both her  father and mother when she was about eighteen years old. There were four  children, all much younger than she, left in her sole care. They had no  uncles or aunts, or other relatives, near, to take care of them, and so  Waubenoo had to hunt and fish to get food for her little brothers and  sisters. Fortunately her father had left a number of good traps and nets,  and plenty of twine for snares, and so the industrious girl got on fairly  well. The great lake near her wigwam was well supplied with fish, and the  forests all round had in them many rabbits and partridges and other small  game. When great storms arose on the big lake, and Waubenoo could not go  out alone in her birch bark canoe to visit her nets, some of the Indians,  who were pleased to see how kind and industrious she was, would overhaul  her nets and bring in what fish were caught. Thus she toiled on, and with  the assistance of these kind Indians she did very nicely. Her little  brothers and sisters loved her dearly, and did what they could to help in  the simpler and easier part of the work. Every decent person among the  Indians was pleased with her industrious habits, and often, in their quiet  way, had some cheery words of encouragement for her.    \"But there was one exception, and this was a selfish Indian hunter who,  seeing what a fine-looking, strong woman she had become, and so clever in  her work with both nets and traps, resolved that she should be his wife, to  work for him and do his bidding. This man had been married before and, if  the reports were true which had been told, it was likely that his wife had  died because of his cruelties to her. So he resolved, in his selfishness,  to take Waubenoo from caring for her brothers and sisters to be his wife,  and to hunt and fish for him, that he might live a life of idleness.    \"Her parents being dead this selfish young Indian did not have to go to her  father to buy her to be his wife. All he thought he had to do was to go and  tell her she had to be his wife and come and do as he commanded her. So  harsh and cold were his words, and so very rough and forbidding his looks,  that, while Waubenoo was frightened, she was grave and high spirited enough  to indignantly refuse his request, and to order him never to trouble her  again.    \"This, of course, made him very angry. He refused to go, and continued to  insist on her going with him.    \"Fearing that he might revenge himself upon her by doing her or the  children some harm, she told him that it was her duty to stay with the  little ones whom the death of the parents had left in her care; that they  might perish if she now left them.    \"But nothing would turn away his anger, and if it had not happened just  then that some friendly Indians came along he would have cruelly beaten  her. Before them he durst not strike her, and so, muttering some threats,  he sulkily strode away into the forest.    \"Poor Waubenoo was now sadly troubled. Lighthearted and free, she had  cheerfully worked and toiled for her loved ones, but now here comes this  cruel, fierce-looking man, whom she could only look on with fear and dread,  and threatens to drag her away from them all. Gray Wolf, for that was his  name, had a bad reputation among the Indians. The young men shunned him and  the maidens took good care to be out of the way when he was around. That he  would persist in his attempts to get Waubenoo all were convinced, but that  he should succeed no one desired. Still, while Indian ideas on some of  these things are so peculiar that no one seemed disposed to interfere, at  the same time some of them were generally on the lookout for her  protection. As for brave Waubenoo, while certain that he would still  trouble her, she was resolved never to submit to him.    \"Thus the weeks rolled on, with Gray Wolf looking for some opportunity to  carry her off, and making several attempts to do so, which Waubenoo, ever  alert and watchful, succeeded in preventing.    \"At length his persistent attempts became so annoying that she was obliged  to neglect much of her work in order to keep on her guard. Food was getting  scarce because she dared not now go far from her wigwam to hunt for the  partridges "]]]
