O thou beautiful one, he  that suppresseth his anger earneth prosperity. That man, again, who  always giveth way to anger, reapeth adversity from his fierce anger. It  is seen in this world that anger is the cause of destruction of every  creature. How then can one like me indulge his anger which is so  destructive of the world? The angry man commiteth sin. The angry man  killeth even his preceptors. The angry man insulteth even his superiors  in harsh words. The man that is angry faileth to distinguish between  what should be said and what should not. There is no act that an angry  man may not do, no word that an angry man may not utter. From anger a  man may slay one that deserveth not to be slain, and may worship one  that deserveth to be slain. The angry man may even send his own soul to  the regions of Yama. Beholding all these faults, the wise control their  anger, desirous of obtaining high prosperity both in this and the other  world. It is for this that they of tranquil souls have banished wrath.  How can one like us indulge in it then? O daughter of Drupada,  reflecting upon all this, my anger is not excited. One that acteth not  against a man whose wrath hath been up, rescueth himself as also others  from great fear. In fact, he may be regarded to be the physician of the  two (_viz_., himself and angry man). If a weak man, persecuted by  others, foolishly becometh angry towards men that are mightier than he,  he then becometh himself the cause of his own destruction. And in  respect of one who thus deliberately throweth away his life, there are  no regions hereafter to gain. Therefore, O daughter of Drupada, it hath  been said that a weak man should always suppress his wrath. And the wise  man also who though persecuted, suffereth not his wrath to be roused,  joyeth in the other world--having passed his persecutor over in  indifference. It is for this reason hath it been said that a wise man,  whether strong or weak, should ever forgive his persecutor even when the  latter is in the straits. It is for this, O Krishna, that the virtuous  applaud them that have conquered their wrath. Indeed, it is the opinion  of the virtuous that the honest and forgiving man is ever victorious.  Truth is more beneficial than untruth; and gentleness than cruel  behaviour. How can one like me, therefore, even for the purpose of  slaying Duryodhana, exhibit anger which hath so many faults and which  the virtuous banish from their souls? They that are regarded by the  learned of foresight, as possessed of (true) force of character, are  certainly those who are wrathful in outward show only. Men of learning  and of true insight call him to be possessed of force of character who  by his wisdom can suppress his risen wrath. O thou of fair hips, the  angry man seeth not things in their true light. The man that is angry  seeth not his way, nor respecteth persons. The angry man killeth even  those that deserve not to be killed. The man of wrath slayeth even his  preceptors. Therefore, the man possessing force of character should ever  banish wrath to a distance. The man that is overwhelmed with wrath  acquireth not with ease generosity, dignity, courage, skill, and other  attributes belonging to real force of character. A man by forsaking  anger can exhibit proper energy, whereas, O wise one, it is highly  difficult for the angry man to exhibit his energy at the proper time!  The ignorant always regard anger as equivalent to energy. Wrath, however  hath been given to man for the destruction of the world. The man,  therefore, who wisheth to behave properly, must ever forsake anger. Even  one who hath abandoned the excellent virtues of his own order, it is  certain, indulgeth in wrath (if behaveth properly). If fools, of mind  without light, transgress in every respect, how, O faultless one, can  one like me transgress (like them)? If amongst men there were not  persons equal unto the earth in forgiveness, there would be no peace  among men but continued strife caused by wrath. If the injured return  their injuries, if one chastised by his superior were to chastise his  superior in return, the consequence would be the destruction of every  creature, and sin also would prevail in the world. If the man who hath  ill speeches from another, returneth those speeches afterwards; if the  injured man returneth his injuries; if the chastised person chastiseth  in return; if fathers slay sons, and sons fathers and if husbands slay  wives, and wives husbands; then, O Krishna, how can birth take place in  a world where anger prevaileth so! For, O thou of handsome face, know  that the birth of creatures is due to peace! If the kings also, O  Draupadi, giveth way to wrath, his subjects soon meet with destruction.  Wrath, therefore, hath for its consequence the destruction and the  distress of the people. And because it is seen that there are in the  world men who are forgiving like the Earth, it is therefore that  creatures derive their life and prosperity. O beautiful one, one should  forgive under every injury. It hath been said that the continuation of  species is due to man being forgiving. He, indeed, is a wise and  excellent person who hath conquered his wrath and who showeth  forgiveness even when insulted, oppressed, and angered by a strong  person. The man of power who controleth his wrath, hath (for his  enjoyment) numerous everlasting regions; while he that is angry, is  called foolish, and meeteth with destruction both in this and the other  world. O Krishna, the illustrious and forgiving Kasyapa hath, in this  respect, sung the following verses in honour of men that are ever  forgiving, \"Forgiveness is virtue, forgiveness is sacrifice, forgiveness  is the Vedas, forgiveness is the _Shruti_. He that knoweth this is  capable of forgiving everything. Forgiveness is _Brahma_; forgiveness is  truth; forgiveness is stored ascetic merit; forgiveness protecteth the  ascetic merit of the future; forgiveness is asceticism; forgiveness is  holiness; and by forgiveness is it that the universe is held together.  Persons that are forgiving attain to the regions obtainable by those  that have performed meritorious sacrifices, or those that are  well-conversant with the Vedas, or those that have high ascetic merit.  Those that perform Vedic sacrifices as also those that perform the  meritorious rites of religion obtain other regions. Men of forgiveness,  however, obtain those much-adored regions that are in the world of  Brahma. Forgiveness is the might of the mighty; forgiveness is  sacrifice; forgiveness is quiet of mind. How, O Krishna, can one like us  abandon forgiveness, which is such, and in which are established  _Brahma_, and truth, and wisdom and the worlds? The man of wisdom should  ever forgive, for when he is capable of forgiving everything, he  attaineth to _Brahma_. The world belongeth to those that are forgiving;  the other world is also theirs. The forgiving acquire honours here, and  a state of blessedness hereafter. Those men that ever conquer their  wrath by forgiveness, obtain the higher regions. Therefore hath it been  said that forgiveness is the highest virtue.\" Those are the verses sung  by Kasyapa in respect of those that are everforgiving. Having listened,  O Draupadi, to these verses in respect of forgiveness, content thyself!  Give not way to thy wrath! Our grandsire, the son of Santanu, will  worship peace; Krishna, the son of Devaki, will worship peace; the  preceptor (Drona) and Vidura called _Kshatri_ will both speak of peace;  Kripa and Sanjaya also will preach peace. And Somadatta and Yuyutshu and  Drona's son and our grandsire Vyasa, every one of them speaketh always  of peace. Ever urged by these towards peace, the king (Dhritarashtra)  will, I think, return us our kingdom. If however, he yieldeth to  temptation, he will meet with destruction. O lady, a crisis hath come in  the history of Bharatas for plunging them into calamity! This hath been  my certain conclusion from some time before! Suyodhana deserveth not the  kingdom. Therefore hath he been unable to acquire forgiveness. I,  however, deserve the sovereignty and therefore is it that forgiveness  hath taken possession of me. Forgiveness and gentleness are the  qualities of the self-possessed. They represent eternal virtue. I shall,  therefore, truly adopt those qualities.'\"      SECTION XXX    \"Draupadi said, 'I bow down unto _Dhatri_ and _Vidhatri_ who have thus  clouded thy sense! Regarding the burden (thou art to bear) thou thinkest  differently from the ways of thy fathers and grand-fathers! Influenced  by acts men are placed in different situations of life. Acts, therefore,  produce consequences that are inevitable; emancipation is desired from  mere folly. It seemeth that man can never attain prosperity in this  world by virtue, gentleness, forgiveness, straight-forwardness and fear  of censure! If this were not so, O Bharata, this insufferable calamity  would never have overtaken thee who art so undeserving of it, and these  thy brothers of great energy! Neither in those days of prosperity nor in  these days of thy adversity, thou, O Bharata, hath ever known anything  so dear to thee as virtue, which thou hast even regarded as dearer to  thee than life! That thy kingdom is for virtue alone, that thy life also  is for virtue alone, is known to Brahmanas and thy superiors and even  the celestials! I think thou canst abandon Bhimasena and Arjuna and  these twin sons of Madri along with myself but thou canst not abandon  virtue! I have heard that the king protecteth virtue; and virtue,  protected by him, protecteth him (in return)! I see, however, that  virtue protecteth thee not! Like the shadow pursuing a man, thy heart, O  tiger among men, with singleness of purpose, ever seeketh virtue. Thou  hast never disregarded thy equals, and inferiors"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11924"],[0,"The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry (#18)"],[1,"od' and adds a description of the forest in springtime solely, he  says, in order once again to recall Krishna.[51] When, at last, the poem  has come triumphantly to its close, Jayadeva again exhorts people to adore  Krishna and 'place him for ever in their hearts, Krishna the source of all  merit.'    The poem begins with a preface of four lines describing how Krishna's  romance with Radha first began. The sky, it says, was dark with clouds.  All around lay the vast forest. Night was coming up and Nanda who had  taken the youthful Krishna with him is alarmed lest in the gathering gloom  the boy should get lost. Radha, who is somewhat older, is with them, so  Nanda desires her to take Krishna home. Radha leads him away but as they  wander by the river, passion mounts in their hearts. They forget that  Nanda has told them to hurry home. Radha ignores the motherly character of  her mission and loitering in the trees, the two commence their  dalliance.[52] In this way the love of Radha and Krishna arises--the love  which is to dominate their hearts with ever-growing fervour.    The poem then leaps a period of time and when the drama opens, a crisis  has occurred. Radha, after long enjoying Krishna's passionate embraces,  finds herself abruptly neglected. Charming but faithless, Krishna is now  pursuing other girls and the jilted Radha wanders alone. Meanwhile spring  has come to the forest and the thought that others are enjoying Krishna's  love tortures her to the point of madness. As she broods on her lost joys,  a friend describes to her what is happening.[53]      Sandal and garment of yellow and lotus garlands upon his body of      blue,    In his dance the jewels of his ears in movement dangling over his      smiling cheeks,    Krishna here disports himself with charming women given to love.      He embraces one woman, he kisses another, and fondles another      beautiful one.    He looks at another one lovely with smiles, and starts in pursuit of      another woman.    Krishna here disports himself with charming women given to love.[54]    Suddenly Radha sees Krishna[55] and going into the midst of the cowgirls,  she kisses him violently and clasps him to her; but Krishna is so inflamed  by the other girls that he abandons her in a thicket.    As Radha broods on his behaviour, she is filled with bitter sadness.[56]  Yet her love is still so strong that she cannot bring herself to blame  him and instead calls to mind his charm.      I remember Krishna, the jests he made, who placed his sport in the      pastoral dance,    The sweet of whose nectar of lips kept flowing with notes of his luring      melodious flute,    With the play of whose eyes and the toss of whose head the earrings      kept dangling upon his cheeks.      I remember Krishna, the jests he made, who placed his sport in the      pastoral dance,    Whose brow had a perfect sandal spot, as among dark clouds the disc      of the moon,    Whose door-like heart was without pity when crushing the bosoms of      swelling breasts.      Desire even now in my foolish mind for Krishna,    For Krishna--without me--lusting still for the herd-girls.    Seeing only the good in his nature, what shall I do?    Agitated I feel no anger. Pleased without cause, I acquit him.    And she continues:      O make him enjoy me, my friend, that Krishna so fickle,    I who am shy like a girl on her way to the first of her trysts of love,    He who is charming with flattering words, I who am tender    In speech and smiling, he on whose hip the garment lies loosely worn.      O make him enjoy me, my friend, that Krishna so fickle,    Me who sweated and moistened all over my body with love's exertion,    That Krishna whose cheeks were lovely with down all standing on end      as he thrilled,    Whose half-closed eyes were languid, and restless with brimming      desire.      O make him enjoy me, my friend, that Krishna so fickle,    Me whose masses of curls were like loose-slipping flowers, whose      amorous words    Were vague as of doves, that Krishna whose bosom is marked    With scratches, surpassing all in his love that the science of love      could teach.      O make him enjoy me, my friend, that Krishna so fickle,    To whose act of desire accomplished the anklets upon my feet bejewelled    Vibrated sounding, who gave his kisses seizing the hair of the head,    And to whom in his passionate love my girdle sounded in eloquence      sweet.    As Radha sits longing for him in lonely sadness, Krishna suddenly  repents, is filled with remorse and abruptly goes in quest of her. He does  not know, however, where to find her and as he wanders, he expresses his  sorrow.      Radha so deeply wronged, troubled to see me surrounded by women,    She went, and I, in fear of my guilt, made no attempt to stop her,    Alas, alas, she is gone in anger, her love destroyed.      O my slender one, I imagine your heart is dejected,    I cannot console you kneeling in homage, I know not where to find      you.    If you pardon me now I shall never repeat this neglect of you ever--    O beautiful, give me your pleasure again. I burn with desire.    As Krishna searches unavailingly, Radha's friend lights upon him and  conveys news of her love-tormented state.      Armour she makes of tender lotus garlands to hide her bosom from      you,    Large garlands, as if to protect you from heavy showers of shafts from      the god of love.    She fears an attack of Love upon you, and lies away hidden;    She wastes away, Krishna, parted from you.    As he hears this, Krishna is torn with longing. He does not, however, go  immediately to Radha but instead asks the friend to bring Radha to him.  The girl departs, meets Radha and gives her Krishna's message. She then  describes Krishna's love-lorn state:      When he hears the noise of swarms of bees, he covers his ears from their      humming;    Pain he feels, night after night, of a heart in love that is parted.    He droops, separated from you, O friend, the wearer of garlands.    The girl assures Radha that Krishna is contrite and urges her to delay no  longer.      He has gone into the trysting place, full of all desired bliss, O you      with lovely hips delay no more    O go forth now and seek him out, him the master of your heart, him      endowed with passion's lovely form.      On fallen feathers of the birds, on leaves about the forest floor, he      lies excited making there his bed,    And he gazes out upon the path, looks about with trembling eyes, anxious,      looking out for your approach.      There on that bed of tender leaves, O lotus-eyed, embrace his hips, his      naked hips from whence the girdle drops,    Those hips from whence the garment falls, those loins which are a      treasure heap, the fountain and the source of all delight.    Radha would willingly go but she is now so sick with love that she can no  longer move. The girl has, therefore, to go once more to Krishna and  describe Radha's state.      In secret on every side she sees you    Drinking the honied sweet of her lips.    Where Radha stays now she wilts away,    She may live no longer without your skill,    Again and again she keeps telling her friend,    'O why must Krishna delay to come?'      Of her jewels abundant her limbs she adorns and spreads out her bed--    Imagining you on her fluttering couch of leaves--    And so to indulge, in a hundred ways, in the sport of love    She is fully resolved, arranging her bed with every adornment;    Not another night may that beautiful girl endure without you.    Why so much apathy, Krishna, beside the fig tree?    O brother, why not go to the pasture of eyes, the abode of bliss?    Despite this message, however, Krishna still delays and Radha, who has  half expected him, endures still greater anguish.      My lover has failed to come to the trysting place,    It is perhaps that his mind is dazed, or perhaps that he went to another      woman    Or lured perhaps by festive folk, that he delays,    Or perhaps along the dark fringe of the forest he wanders lost.    She imagines him toying with another cowgirl.      A certain girl, excelling in her charms unrivalled, dallies with the      sportive Krishna    Her face, a moon, is fondled by the fluttering petals in her hair,    The exciting moisture of his lips induces langour in her limbs,    Her earrings bruise her cheeks while dancing with the motion of her      head,    Her girdle by the tremor of her moving hips is made to tinkle,    She utters senseless sounds, through fever of her love,    He decorates with crimson flowers her curly tresses, curls which are      upon her lively face a mass of clouds,    Flowers with crimson flashings lovely in the forest of her tresses, haunt      of that wild creature love's desire.    And thinking of her own hapless state, Radha contrasts it bitterly with  that of the fortunate girl.      She who with the wearer of the garland lies in dalliance.    With him whose lovely mouth is like a lotus that is opening,    With him whose words are nectar in their sweetness and their tenderness,    With him who wears a garment streaked with gold, all white and      beautiful    Not made to sigh is she, my friend, derided by her girls!    Next morning Radha is standing with her girls when Krishna tries to  approach her. Now, however, he has come too late. Radha has suffered too  greatly. Her patience is at an end and although Krishna implores her to  forgive him, she rounds on him in anger, ordering him to return to the  other girl whom he has just left.[57]      Your mouth, O Krishna, darkened, enhances the crimson beauty of      your lovely body,    Enhances with a, darkness, a blackness that arises from the kissing of      eyes coloured with black unguent.    Go, Krishna, go. Desist from uttering these deceitful words.    Follow her, you lotus-eyed, she who can dispel your trouble, go to      her.      I who follow you devoted--how"]]]
