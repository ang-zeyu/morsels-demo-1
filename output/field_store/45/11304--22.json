The public opinion of the nation was strong for the Western Powers; they  feared the influence of Russia on the internal affairs of Germany; they  had not forgotten or forgiven the part which the Czar had taken in 1849;  the choice seemed to lie between Russia and England, between liberty and  despotism, between civilisation and barbarism. On this side also were  those who wished to maintain the alliance with Austria. Russia had few  friends except at the Court and in the army, but the party of the _Kreuz  Zeitung,_ the Court Camarilla, the princes and nobles who commanded the  _Garde Corps_, wished for nothing better than a close alliance with the  great Emperor who had saved Europe from the Revolution. \"Let us draw our  sword openly in defence of Russia,\" they said, \"then we may bring  Austria with us; the old alliance of the three monarchies will be  restored, and then will be the time for a new crusade against France,  the natural enemy of Germany, and the upstart Emperor.\"    The conflict of parties was keenest in the precincts of the Court;  society in Berlin was divided between the Russian and the English; the  Queen was hot for Russia, but the English party rallied round the Prince  of Prussia and met in the salons of his wife. Between the two the King  wavered; he was, as always, more influenced by feeling than by  calculation, but his feelings were divided. How could he decide between  Austria and Russia, the two ancient allies of his house? He loved and  reverenced the Czar; he feared and distrusted Napoleon; alliance with  infidels against Christians was to him a horrible thought, but he knew  how violent were the actions and lawless the desires of Nicholas. He  could not ignore the opinions of Western Europe and he wished to stand  well with England. The men by whose advice he was guided stood on  opposite sides: Bunsen was for England, Gerlach for Russia; the Ministry  also was divided. No efforts were spared to influence him; the Czar and  Napoleon each sent special envoys to his Court; the Queen of England and  her husband warned him not to forget his duty to Europe and humanity; if  he would join the allies there would be no war. Still he wavered; \"he  goes to bed an Englishman and gets up a Russian,\" said the Czar, who  despised his brother-in-law as much as he was honoured by him.    While the struggle was at its height, Bismarck was summoned to Berlin,  that his opinion might also be heard. At Berlin and at Letzlingen he had  frequent interviews with the King. In later years he described the  situation he found there:      \"It was nothing strange, according to the custom of those days,    that half a dozen ambassadors should be living in hotels    intriguing against the policy of the Minister.\"    He found Berlin divided into two parties: the one looked to the Czar as  their patron and protector, the other wished to win the approval of  England; he missed a reasonable conviction as to what was the interest  of Prussia. His own advice was against alliance with the Western Powers  or Austria; better join Russia than England; better still, preserve  neutrality and hold the balance of Europe. He had the reputation of  being very Russian, but he protested against the term. \"I am not  Russian,\" he said, \"but Prussian.\" He spoke with great decision against  the personal adherents of the King, men who looked to the Czar rather  than to their own sovereign, and carried their subservience even to  treason. As in former days, courage he preached and resolution. Some  talked of the danger of isolation; \"With 400,000 men we cannot be  isolated,\" he said. The French envoy warned him that his policy might  lead to another Jena; \"Why not to Waterloo?\" he answered. Others talked  of the danger of an English blockade of their coasts; he pointed out  that this would injure England more than Prussia.      \"Let us be bold and depend on our own strength; let us frighten    Austria by threatening an alliance with Russia, frighten Russia    by letting her think we may join the Western Powers; if it were    true that we could never side with Russia, at least we must    retain the possibility of threatening to do so.\"    The result was what we might expect from the character of the King;  unable to decide for either of the contending factors, he alternated  between the two, and gave his support now to one, now to the other. In  March, when Bismarck was still in Berlin, sudden disgrace fell upon the  English party; Bunsen was recalled from London, Bonin, their chief  advocate in the Ministry, was dismissed; when the Prince of Prussia, the  chief patron of the Western alliance, protested, he was included in the  act of disfavour, and had to leave Berlin, threatened with the loss of  his offices and even with arrest. All danger of war with Russia seemed  to have passed; Bismarck returned content to Frankfort. Scarcely had he  gone when the old affection for Austria gained the upper hand, and by a  separate treaty Prussia bound herself to support the Austrian demands,  if necessary by arms. Bismarck heard nothing of the treaty till it was  completed; the Ministers had purposely refrained from asking his advice  on a policy which they knew he would disapprove. He overcame his  feelings of disgust so far as to send a cold letter of congratulation to  Manteuffel; to Gerlach he wrote:      \"His Majesty should really see to it that his Ministers should    drink more champagne; none of the gentry ought to enter his    Council without half a bottle under his belt. Our policy would    soon get a respectable colour.\"    The real weakness lay, as he well knew, in the character of the King.  \"If here I say to one of my colleagues, 'We remain firm even if Austria  drives matters to a breach,' he laughs in my face and says, 'As long as  the King lives it will not come to a war between Austria and Prussia.'\"  And again, \"The King has as much leniency for the sins of Austria as I  hope to have from the Lord in Heaven.\"    It was a severe strain on his loyalty, but he withstood it; he has, I  believe, never expressed his opinion about the King; we can guess what  it must have been. It was a melancholy picture: a King violent and  timid, obstinate and irresolute; his will dragged now this way, now  that, by his favourites, his wife and his brother; his own Ministers  intriguing against each other; ambassadors recommending a policy instead  of carrying out their instructions; and the Minister-President standing  calmly by, as best he could, patching up the appearance of a Consistent  policy.    It was probably the experience which he gained at this time which in  later years, when he himself had become Minister, made Bismarck so  jealous of outside and irresponsible advisers; he did not choose to  occupy the position of Manteuffel, he laid down the rule that none of  his own subordinates should communicate with the King except through  himself; a Bismarck as Foreign Minister would not allow a Gerlach at  Court, nor a Bismarck among his envoys. He had indeed been careful not  to intrigue against his chief, but it was impossible to observe that  complete appearance of acquiescence which a strong and efficient  Minister must demand. Bismarck was often asked his opinion by the King  directly; he was obliged to say what he believed to be the truth, and he  often disapproved of that which Manteuffel advised. In order to avoid  the appearance of disloyalty, he asked Gerlach that his letters should  be shewn to Manteuffel; not all of them could be shewn, still less would  it be possible to repeat all he said. If they were in conflict, his duty  to the King must override his loyalty to the Minister, and the two could  not always be reconciled. To Englishmen indeed it appears most improper  that the King should continually call for the advice of other  politicians without the intervention or the knowledge of his Ministers,  but this is just one of those points on which it is impossible to apply  to Prussian practice English constitutional theory. In England it is a  maxim of the Constitution that the sovereign should never consult anyone  on political matters except the responsible Ministry; this is possible  only because the final decision rests with Parliament and the Cabinet  and not with the sovereign. It was, however, always the contention of  Bismarck that the effective decision in Prussia was with the King. This  was undoubtedly the true interpretation of the Prussian Constitution;  but it followed from this that the King must have absolute freedom to  ask the advice of everyone whose opinions would be of help to him; he  must be able to command the envoys to foreign countries to communicate  with him directly, and if occasion required it, to consult with the  political opponents of his own Ministers. To forbid this and to require  that all requests should come to him by the hands of the Ministers would  be in truth to substitute ministerial autocracy for monarchical  government.    Something of this kind did happen in later years when the German Emperor  had grown old, and when Bismarck, supported by his immense experience  and success, guided the policy of the country alone, independent of  Parliament, and scarcely allowing any independent adviser to approach  the Emperor. This was exceptional; normally a Prussian Minister had to  meet his opponents and critics not so much in public debate as in  private discussion. Under a weak sovereign the policy of the country  must always be distracted by palace intrigue, just as in England under a  weak Cabinet it will be distracted by party faction. The Ministers must  always be prepared to find their best-laid schemes overthrown by the  influence exerted upon the royal mind by his private friends or even by  his family. It may be said that tenure of office under these conditions  would be impossible to a man of spirit; it was certainly very  difficult; an able and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#18)"],[1,"it were, out of the way. Remote  recollections of former dealings with civilised human beings, in the shape  of masters and overseers, seemed to me to be the only idea not purely  idiotic in the minds of the poor old tottering creatures that gathered to  stare with dim and blear eyes at me and my children.    There were two very aged women, who had seen different, and to their faded  recollections better, times, who spoke to me of Mr. ----'s grandfather,  and of the early days of the plantation, when they were young and strong,  and worked as their children and grandchildren were now working, neither  for love nor yet for money. One of these old crones, a hideous, withered,  wrinkled piece of womanhood, said that she had worked as long as her  strength had lasted, and that then she had still been worth her keep, for,  said she, 'Missus, tho' we no able to work, we make little niggers for  massa.' Her joy at seeing her present owner was unbounded, and she kept  clapping her horny hands together and exclaiming, 'while there is life  there is hope; we seen massa before we die.' These demonstrations of  regard were followed up by piteous complaints of hunger and rheumatism,  and their usual requests for pittances of food and clothing, to which we  responded by promises of additions in both kinds; and I was extricating  myself as well as I could from my petitioners, with the assurance that I  would come by-and-bye and visit them again, when I felt my dress suddenly  feebly jerked, and a shrill cracked voice on the other side of me  exclaimed, 'Missus, no go yet--no go away yet; you no see me, missus, when  you come by-and-bye; but,' added the voice in a sort of wail, which seemed  to me as if the thought was full of misery, 'you see many, many of my  offspring.' These melancholy words, particularly the rather unusual one at  the end of the address, struck me very much. They were uttered by a  creature which _was_ a woman, but looked like a crooked ill-built figure  set up in a field to scare crows, with a face infinitely more like a mere  animal's than any human countenance I ever beheld, and with that peculiar  wild restless look of indefinite and, at the same time, intense sadness  that is so remarkable in the countenance of some monkeys. It was almost  with an effort that I commanded myself so as not to withdraw my dress from  the yellow crumpled filthy claws that griped it, and it was not at last  without the authoritative voice of the overseer that the poor creature  released her hold of me.    We returned home certainly in the very strangest vehicle that ever  civilised gentlewoman travelled in--a huge sort of cart, made only of some  loose boards, on which I lay supporting myself against one of the four  posts which indicated the sides of my carriage; six horned creatures, cows  or bulls, drew this singular equipage, and a yelping, howling, screaming,  leaping company of half-naked negroes ran all round them, goading them  with sharp sticks, frantically seizing hold of their tails, and inciting  them by every conceivable and inconceivable encouragement to quick motion:  thus, like one of the ancient Merovingian monarchs, I was dragged through  the deep sand from the settlement back to the river, where we reembarked  for the island.    As we crossed the broad flood, whose turbid waters always look swollen as  if by a series of freshets, a flight of birds sprang from the low swamp we  were approaching, and literally, as it rose in the air, cast a shadow  like that of a cloud, which might be said, with but little exaggeration,  to darken the sun for a few seconds. How well I remember my poor aunt  Whitelock describing such phenomena as of frequent occurrence in America,  and the scornful incredulity with which we heard without accepting these  legends of her Western experience! how little I then thought that I should  have to cry peccavi to her memory from the bottom of such ruts, and under  the shadow of such flights of winged creatures as she used to describe  from the muddy ways of Pennsylvania and the muddy waters of Georgia!    The vegetation is already in an active state of demonstration, sprouting  into lovely pale green and vivid red-brown buds and leaflets, though 'tis  yet early in January.    After our return home we had a visit from Mr. C----, one of our  neighbours, an intelligent and humane man, to whose account of the  qualities and characteristics of the slaves, as he had observed and  experienced them, I listened with great interest. The Brunswick Canal was  again the subject of conversation, and again the impossibility of allowing  the negroes and Irish to work in proximity was stated, and admitted as an  indisputable fact. It strikes me with amazement to hear the hopeless doom  of incapacity for progress pronounced upon these wretched slaves, when in  my own country the very same order of language is perpetually applied to  these very Irish, here spoken of as a sort of race of demigods, by negro  comparison. And it is most true that in Ireland nothing can be more  savage, brutish, filthy, idle, and incorrigibly and hopelessly helpless  and incapable, than the Irish appear; and yet, transplanted to your  northern states, freed from the evil influences which surround them at  home, they and their children become industrious, thrifty, willing to  learn, able to improve, and forming, in the course of two generations, a  most valuable accession to your labouring population. How is it that it  never occurs to these emphatical denouncers of the whole negro race that  the Irish at home are esteemed much as they esteem their slaves, and that  the sentence pronounced against their whole country by one of the greatest  men of our age, an Irishman, was precisely, that nothing could save,  redeem, or regenerate Ireland unless, as a preparatory measure, the island  were submerged and all its inhabitants drowned off?    I have had several women at the house to-day asking for advice and help  for their sick children: they all came from No. 2, as they call it, that  is, the settlement or cluster of negro huts nearest to the main one, where  we may be said to reside. In the afternoon I went thither, and found a  great many of the little children ailing; there had been an unusual  mortality among them at this particular settlement this winter. In one  miserable hut I heard that the baby was just dead; it was one of thirteen,  many of whom had been, like itself, mercifully removed from the life of  degradation and misery to which their birth appointed them: and whether  it was the frequent repetition of similar losses, or an instinctive  consciousness that death was indeed better than life for such children as  theirs, I know not, but the father and mother, and old Rose, the nurse,  who was their little baby's grandmother, all seemed apathetic, and  apparently indifferent to the event. The mother merely repeated over and  over again, 'I've lost a many, they all goes so;' and the father, without  word or comment, went out to his enforced labour.    As I left the cabin, rejoicing for them at the deliverance out of slavery  of their poor child, I found myself suddenly surrounded by a swarm of  young ragamuffins in every stage of partial nudity, clamouring from out of  their filthy remnants of rags for donations of scarlet ribbon for the  ball, which was to take place that evening. The melancholy scene I had  just witnessed, and the still sadder reflection it had given rise to, had  quite driven all thoughts of the approaching festivity from my mind; but  the sudden demand for these graceful luxuries by Mr. ----'s half-naked  dependants reminded me of the grotesque mask which life wears on one of  its mysterious faces; and with as much sympathy for rejoicing as my late  sympathy for sorrow had left me capable of, I procured the desired  ornaments. I have considerable fellow-feeling for the passion for all  shades of red, which prevails among these dusky fellow-creatures of  mine--a savage propensity for that same colour in all its modifications  being a tendency of my own.    At our own settlement (No. 1) I found everything in a high fever of  preparation for the ball. A huge boat had just arrived from the cotton  plantation at St. Simons, laden with the youth and beauty of that portion  of the estate who had been invited to join the party; and the greetings  among the arrivers and welcomers, and the heaven-defying combinations of  colour in the gala attire of both, surpass all my powers of description.  The ball, to which of course we went, took place in one of the rooms of  the Infirmary. As the room had, fortunately, but few occupants, they were  removed to another apartment, and, without any very tender consideration  for their not very remote, though invisible, sufferings, the dancing  commenced, and was continued. Oh, my dear E----! I have seen Jim Crow--the  veritable James: all the contortions, and springs, and flings, and kicks,  and capers you have been beguiled into accepting as indicative of him are  spurious, faint, feeble, impotent--in a word, pale northern reproductions  of that ineffable black conception. It is impossible for words to describe  the things these people did with their bodies, and, above all, with their  faces, the whites of their eyes, and the whites of their teeth, and  certain outlines which either naturally and by the grace of heaven, or by  the practice of some peculiar artistic dexterity, they bring into  prominent and most ludicrous display. The languishing elegance of some,  the painstaking laboriousness of others, above all, the feats of a certain  enthusiastic banjo-player, who seemed to me to thump his instrument with  every part of his body at once, at last so utterly overcame any attempt at  decorous gravity on my part that I was obliged to secede; and, considering  what the atmosphere was that we inhaled during the exhibition, it is only  wonderful to me that we were"]]]
