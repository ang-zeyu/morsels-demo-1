With them the fear  of unseen powers and the desire to obtain their favor is the  only rule of life and the only maxim taught to the people. And  it is the foundation upon which the influence and power of the  Brahmins depend. The world and all its inhabitants are at the  mercy of cruel, fickle and unjust gods; the gods are under the  influence of the Brahmins; hence the Brahmins are holy men and  must be treated accordingly. No Hindu will offend a Brahmin under  any circumstances, lest his curse may call down all forms of  misfortune. A Hindu proverb says:    \"What is in the Brahmin's books, that is in the Brahmin's heart.  Neither you nor I knew there was so much evil in the world.\"    The power of the priests or Brahmins over the Hindus is one of  the phenomena of India. I do not know where you can get a better  idea of their influence and of the reverence that is paid to  them than in \"Kim,\" Rudyard Kipling's story of an Irish boy who  was a disciple of an old Thibetan lama or Buddhist monk. That  story is appreciated much more keenly by people who have lived  or traveled in India, because it appeals to them. There is a  familiar picture on every page, and it is particularly valuable  as illustrating the relations between the Brahmins and the people.  \"These priests are invested,\" said one of the ablest writers on  Indian affairs, \"with a reverence which no extreme of abject  poverty, no infamy of private conduct can impair, and which is  beyond anything that a mind not immediately conversant with the  fact can conceive. They are invariably addressed with titles of  divinity, and are paid the highest earthly honors. The oldest  and highest members of other castes implore the blessing of the  youngest and poorest of theirs; they are the chosen recipients  of all charities, and are allowed a license in their private  relations which would be resented as a deadly injury in any but  themselves.\"    This reverence is largely due to superstitions which the Brahmins  do their best to cultivate and encourage. There are 30,000,000  gods in the Hindu pantheon, and each attends to the affairs of his  own particular jurisdiction. Most of them are wicked, cruel and  unkind, and delight in bringing misfortunes upon their devotees,  which can only be averted by the intercession of a priest. Gods and  demons haunt every hill and grove and gorge and dark corner. Their  names are usually unknown, but they go on multiplying as events  or incidents occur to which the priests can give a supernatural  interpretation. These gods are extremely sensitive to disrespect  or neglect, and unless they are constantly propitiated they will  bring all sorts of disasters. The Brahmin is the only man who  knows how to make them good-natured. He can handle them exactly  as he likes, and they will obey his will. Hence the superstitious  peasants yield everything, their money, their virtue, their lives,  as compensation for the intercession of the priests in their  behalf.    The census of 1901 returned 2,728,812 priests, which is an average  of one for every seventy-two members of the Hindu faith, and  it is believed that, altogether, there are more than 9,000,000  persons including monks, nuns, ascetics, fakirs, sorcerers, chelas,  and mendicants or various kinds and attendants employed about  the temples who are dependent upon the public for support. A  large part of the income of the pious Hindu is devoted to the  support of priests and the feeding of pilgrims. Wherever you  see it, wherever you meet it, and especially when you come in  contact with it as a sightseer, Brahminism excites nothing but  pity, indignation and abhorrence.    Buddhism is very different, although Buddha lived and died a  Hindu, and the members of that sect still claim that he was the  greatest, the wisest and the best of all Brahmins. No two religions  are so contradictory and incompatible as that taught by Buddha and  the modern teachings of the Brahmins. The underlying principles of  Buddha's faith are love, charity, self-sacrifice, unselfishness,  universal brotherhood and spiritual and physical purity. He believed  in none of the present practices of the Hindu priests. There is  a striking resemblance between the teachings of Buddha and the  teachings of Christ. Passages in the New Testament, reporting  the words of the Savior, seem like plagiarisms from the maxims of  Buddha, and, indeed, Buddhist scholars tell of a myth concerning  a young Jew who about five centuries after Buddha, and twenty  centuries ago, came from Syria with a caravan and spent several  years under instruction in a Buddhist monastery in Thibet. Thus  they account for the silence of the scriptures concerning the  doings of Christ between the ages of 12 and 20, and for the  similarity between his sermons and those preached by the founder  of their religion. Buddha taught that good actions bring happiness  and bad actions misery; that selfishness is the cause of sin,  sorrow and suffering, and that the abolition of self, sacrifices  for others and the suppression of passions and desires is the  only true plan of salvation. He died 543 years before Jesus was  born, and within the next two centuries his teachings were accepted  by two-thirds of the people of India, but by the tenth century  of our era they had been forgotten, and a great transformation  had taken place among the Indo-Ayran races, who began to worship  demons instead of angels and teach fear instead of hope, until  now there are practically no Buddhists in India with the exception  of the Burmese, who are almost unanimous in the confession of  that faith. It is a singular phenomenon that Buddhism should  so disappear from the land of its birth, although 450,000,000  of the human race still turn to its founder with pure affection  as the wisest of teachers and the noblest of ideals.    The teachings of Buddha survive in a sect known as the Jains,  founded by Jina, or Mahavira, a Buddhist priest, about a thousand  years ago, as a protest against the cruel encroachments of the  Hindus. Jina was a Perfect One, who subdued all worldly desires;  who lived an unselfish life, practiced the golden rule, harmed  no living thing, and attained the highest aim of the soul, right  knowledge, right conduct, temperance, sobriety, chastity and a  Holy Calm.    There are now 1,334,148 Jains in India, and among them are the  wealthiest, most highly cultured and most charitable of all people.  They carry their love of life to extremes. A true believer will  not harm an insect, not even a mosquito or a flea. All Hindus  are kind to animals, except when they ill treat them through  ignorance, as is often the case. The Brahmins represent that  murder, robbery, deception and every other form of crime and  vice may be committed in the worship of their gods. They teach  that the gods themselves are guilty of the most hideous depravity,  and that the sacrifice of wives, children, brothers, sisters  and friends to convenience or expediency for selfish ends is  justifiable. Indeed, the British government has been compelled to  interfere and prohibit the sacrifice of human life to propitiate  the Hindu gods. It has suppressed the thugs, who, as you have  read, formerly went about the country killing people in order  to acquire holiness; it has prohibited the awful processions  of the car of Juggernaut, before which hysterical fanatics used  to throw their own bodies, and the bodies of their children, to  be crushed under the iron wheels, in the hope of pleasing some  monster among their deities. The suppression of infanticide,  which is still encouraged by the Brahmins, is now receiving the  vigilant attention of the authorities.    Every effort has been made during the last fifty years to prevent  the awful cruelties to human beings that formerly were common in  Hindu worship, but no police intervention has ever been necessary  to protect dumb animals; nobody was ever punished for cruelty to  them; on the contrary, animal worship is one of the most general  of practices among the Hindus, and many beasts and reptiles are  sacred. But the Jains go still further and establish hospitals  for aged and infirm animals. You can see them in Bombay, in Delhi,  Lucknow, Calcutta and other places where the Jains are strong.  Behind their walls may be found hundreds of decrepit horses,  diseased cows and bullocks, many dogs and cats and every kind of  sick, lame and infirm beast. Absurd stories are told strangers  concerning the extremes to which this benevolence is carried,  and some of them have actually appeared in published narratives  of travel in India. One popular story is that when a flea lights  upon the body of a Jain he captures it carefully, puts it in  a receptacle and sends it to an asylum where fat coolies are  hired to sit around all day and night and allow fleas, mosquitoes  and other insects to feed upon them. But although untrue, these  ridiculous stories are valuable as illustrating the principles  in which the Jains believe. They are strict vegetarians. The  true believers will not kill an animal or a fish or a bird, or  anything that breathes, for any purpose, and everybody can see  that they strictly practice what they preach.    His most gracious majesty, King of Great Britain and Ireland and  Emperor of India, has more Mohammedan subjects than the Great  Turk or any other ruler. They numbered 62,458,061 at the last  census. They are a clean, manly, honorable and industrious portion  of the population. Commercially they do not rank as high as the  Parsees, who number only 94,190, or the Jains, who number 1,334,148,  but are vastly superior to the Hindus from any point of view.  They are not so ignorant nor so filthy nor so superstitious nor  so submissive to their priests. They are self-respecting and  independent, and while the believers in no other creed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11242"],[0,"The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti (#18)"],[1,"S. Peter's  which were occasioned by the project of Julius, or to comprehend the  immense annoyances to which the tomb exposed Michelangelo, without  grappling with its details. Condivi's text must serve for guide. This,  in fact, is the sole source of any positive value. He describes the  tomb, as he believed it to have been first planned, in the following  paragraph:--    \"To give some notion of the monument, I will say that it was intended  to have four faces: two of eighteen cubits, serving for the sides, and  two of twelve for the ends, so that the whole formed one great square  and a half. Surrounding it externally were niches to be filled with  statues, and between each pair of niches stood terminal figures, to  the front of which were attached on certain consoles projecting from  the wall another set of statues bound like prisoners. These  represented the Liberal Arts, and likewise Painting, Sculpture,  Architecture, each with characteristic emblems, rendering their  identification easy. The intention was to show that all the talents  had been taken captive by death, together with Pope Julius, since  never would they find another patron to cherish and encourage them as  he had done. Above these figures ran a cornice, giving unity to the  whole work. Upon the flat surface formed by this cornice were to be  four large statues, one of which, that is, the Moses, now exists at S.  Pietro ad Vincula. And so, arriving at the summit, the tomb ended in a  level space, whereon were two angels who supported a sarcophagus. One  of them appeared to smile, rejoicing that the soul of the Pope had  been received among the blessed spirits; the other seemed to weep, as  sorrowing that the world had been robbed of such a man. From one of  the ends, that is, by the one which was at the head of the monument,  access was given to a little chamber like a chapel, enclosed within  the monument, in the midst of which was a marble chest, wherein the  corpse of the Pope was meant to be deposited. The whole would have  been executed with stupendous finish. In short, the sepulchre included  more than forty statues, not counting the histories in half-reliefs,  made of bronze, all of them pertinent to the general scheme and  representative of the mighty Pontiff's actions.\"    Vasari's account differs in some minor details from Condivi's, but it  is of no authoritative value. Not having appeared in the edition of  1550, we may regard it as a _rechauffee_ of Condivi, with the usual  sauce provided by the Aretine's imagination. The only addition I can  discover which throws light upon Condivi's narrative is that the  statues in the niches were meant to represent provinces conquered by  Julius. This is important, because it leads us to conjecture that  Vasari knew a drawing now preserved in the Uffizi, and sought, by its  means, to add something to his predecessor's description. The drawing  will occupy our attention shortly; but it may here be remarked that in  1505, the date of the first project, Julius was only entering upon his  conquests. It would have been a gross act of flattery on the part of  the sculptor, a flying in the face of Nemesis on the part of his  patron, to design a sepulchre anticipating length of life and luck  sufficient for these triumphs.    What then Condivi tells us about the first scheme is, that it was  intended to stand isolated in the tribune of S. Peter's; that it  formed a rectangle of a square and half a square; that the podium was  adorned with statues in niches flanked by projecting dadoes supporting  captive arts, ten in number; that at each corner of the platform above  the podium a seated statue was placed, one of which we may safely  identify with the Moses; and that above this, surmounting the whole  monument by tiers, arose a second mass, culminating in a sarcophagus  supported by two angels. He further adds that the tomb was entered at  its extreme end by a door, which led to a little chamber where lay the  body of the Pope, and that bronze bas-reliefs formed a prominent  feature of the total scheme. He reckons that more than forty statues  would have been required to complete the whole design, although he has  only mentioned twenty-two of the most prominent.    More than this we do not know about the first project. We have no  contracts and no sketches that can be referred to the date 1505. Much  confusion has been introduced into the matter under consideration by  the attempt to reconcile Condivi's description with the drawing I have  just alluded to. Heath Wilson even used that drawing to impugn  Condivi's accuracy with regard to the number of the captives, and the  seated figures on the platform. The drawing in question, as we shall  presently see, is of great importance for the subsequent history of  the monument; and I believe that it to some extent preserves the  general aspect which the tomb, as first designed, was intended to  present. Two points about it, however, prevent our taking it as a true  guide to Michelangelo's original conception. One is that it is clearly  only part of a larger scheme of composition. The other is that it  shows a sarcophagus, not supported by angels, but posed upon the  platform. Moreover, it corresponds to the declaration appended in 1513  by Michelangelo to the first extant document we possess about the  tomb.    Julius died in February 1513, leaving, it is said, to his executors  directions that his sepulchre should not be carried out upon the first  colossal plan. If he did so, they seem at the beginning of their trust  to have disregarded his intentions. Michelangelo expressly states in  one of his letters that the Cardinal of Agen wished to proceed with  the tomb, but on a larger scale. A deed dated May 6, 1513, was signed,  at the end of which Michelangelo specified the details of the new  design. It differed from the former in many important respects, but  most of all in the fact that now the structure was to be attached to  the wall of the church. I cannot do better than translate  Michelangelo's specifications. They run as follows: \"Let it be known  to all men that I, Michelangelo, sculptor of Florence, undertake to  execute the sepulchre of Pope Julius in marble, on the commission of  the Cardinal of Agens and the Datary (Pucci), who, after his death,  have been appointed to complete this work, for the sum of 16,500  golden ducats of the Camera; and the composition of the said sepulchre  is to be in the form ensuing: A rectangle visible from three of its  sides, the fourth of which is attached to the wall and cannot be seen.  The front face, that is, the head of this rectangle, shall be twenty  palms in breadth and fourteen in height, the other two, running up  against the wall, shall be thirty-five palms long and likewise  fourteen palms in height. Each of these three sides shall contain two  tabernacles, resting on a basement which shall run round the said  space, and shall be adorned with pilasters, architrave, frieze, and  cornice, as appears in the little wooden model. In each of the said  six tabernacles will be placed two figures about one palm taller than  life (_i.e._, 6-3/4 feet), twelve in all; and in front of each  pilaster which flanks a tabernacle shall stand a figure of similar  size, twelve in all. On the platform above the said rectangular  structure stands a sarcophagus with four feet, as may be seen in the  model, upon which will be Pope Julius sustained by two angels at his  head, with two at his feet; making five figures on the sarcophagus,  all larger than life, that is, about twice the size. Round about the  said sarcophagus will be placed six dadoes or pedestals, on which six  figures of the same dimensions will sit. Furthermore, from the  platform, where it joins the wall, springs a little chapel about  thirty-five palms high (26 feet 3 inches), which shall contain five  figures larger than all the rest, as being farther from the eye.  Moreover, there shall be three histories, either of bronze or of  marble, as may please the said executors, introduced on each face of  the tomb between one tabernacle and another.\" All this Michelangelo  undertook to execute in seven years for the stipulated sum.    The new project involved thirty-eight colossal statues; and,  fortunately for our understanding of it, we may be said with almost  absolute certainty to possess a drawing intended to represent it. Part  of this is a pen-and-ink sketch at the Uffizi, which has frequently  been published, and part is a sketch in the Berlin Collection. These  have been put together by Professor Middleton of Cambridge, who has  also made out a key-plan of the tomb. With regard to its proportions  and dimensions as compared with Michelangelo's specification, there  remain some difficulties, with which I cannot see that Professor  Middleton has grappled. It is perhaps not improbable, as Heath Wilson  suggested, that the drawing had been thrown off as a picturesque  forecast of the monument without attention to scale. Anyhow, there is  no doubt that in this sketch, so happily restored by Professor  Middleton's sagacity and tact, we are brought close to Michelangelo's  conception of the colossal work he never was allowed to execute. It  not only answers to the description translated above from the  sculptor's own appendix to the contract, but it also throws light upon  the original plan of the tomb designed for the tribune of S. Peter's.  The basement of the podium has been preserved, we may assume, in its  more salient features. There are the niches spoken of by Condivi, with  Vasari's conquered provinces prostrate at the feet of winged  Victories. These are flanked by the terminal figures, against which,  upon projecting consoles, stand the bound captives. At the right hand  facing us, upon the upper platform, is seated Moses, with a different  action of the hands, it is true, from that which Michelangelo finally  adopted. Near him is a female"]]]
