She had never before met a literary man;  had no idea how the trick was done; and she asked many of those  ingenuous questions which seldom really displease the average gentleman  of this type. When not expatiating upon the heroine whom the exigencies  of \"serial rights\" demanded in his books, Charles Langholm, the talker  and the man, was an unmuzzled misogynist. But nobody would have  suspected it from his answers to Rachel's questions, or from any portion  of their animated conversation. Certainly the aquiline lady whom  Langholm had taken in, and to whom he was only attentive by remorseful  fits and penitential starts, had not that satisfaction; for her  right-hand neighbor did not speak to her at all. There was thus one  close and critical follower of a conversation which without warning took  the one dramatic turn for which Rachel was forever on her guard; only  this once, in an hour of unexpected entertainment, was she not.    \"How do I get my plots?\" said Langholm. \"Sometimes out of my head, as  they say in the nursery; occasionally from real life; more often a blend  of the two combined. You don't often get a present from the newspaper  that you can lift into a magazine more or less as it stands. Facts are  stubborn things; they won't serialize. But now and then there's a case.  There was one a little time ago. Oh, there was a great case not long  since, if we had but the man to handle it, without spoiling it, in  English fiction!\"    \"And what was that?\"    \"The Minchin case!\"    And he looked straight at her, as one only looks at one's neighbor at  table when one is saying or hearing something out of the common; he  turned half round, and he looked in Rachel's face with the smile of an  artist with a masterpiece in his eye. It was an inevitable moment, come  at last when least expected; instinct, however, had prepared Rachel,  just one moment before; and after all she could stare coldly on his  enthusiasm, without a start or a tremor to betray the pose.    \"Yes?\" she said, her fine eyebrows raised a little. \"And do you really  think that would make a book?\"    It was characteristic of Rachel that she did not for a moment--even that  unlooked-for moment--pretend to be unfamiliar with the case.    \"Don't you?\" he asked.    \"I haven't thought about it,\" said Rachel, looking pensively at the  flowers. \"But surely it was a very sordid case?\"    \"The case!\" he cried. \"Yes, sordid as you like; but I don't mean the  case at all.\"    \"Then what do you mean, Mr. Langholm?\"    \"Her after life,\" he whispered; \"the psychology of that woman, and her  subsequent adventures! She disappeared into thin air immediately after  the trial. I suppose you knew that?\"    \"I did hear it.\"    Rachel moistened her lips with champagne.    \"Well, I should take her from that moment,\" said Langholm. \"I should  start her story there.\"    \"And should you make her guilty or not guilty?\"    \"Ah!\" said Langholm, as though that would require consideration;  unluckily, he paused to consider on the spot.    \"Who are you talking about?\" inquired Mr. Venables, who had caught  Rachel's last words.    \"Mrs. Minchin,\" she told him steadily.    \"Guilty!\" cried Mr. Venables, with great energy. \"Guilty, and I'd have  gone to see her hanged myself!\"    And Mr. Venables beamed upon Rachel as though proud of the sentiment,  while the diamonds rose and fell upon her white neck, where he would  have had the rope.    \"A greater scandal,\" he went on, both to Rachel and to the lady on his  other side (who interrupted Mr. Venables to express devout agreement),  \"a greater scandal and miscarriage of justice I have never known.  Guilty? Of course she was guilty; and I only wish we could try her again  and hang her yet! Now don't pretend you sympathize with a woman like  that,\" he said to Rachel, with a look like a nudge; \"you haven't been  married long enough; and for Heaven's sake don't refuse that bird! It's  the best that can be got this time of year, though that's not saying  much; but wait till the grouse season, Mrs. Steel! I have a moor here in  the dales, keep a cellar full of them, and eat 'em as they drop off the  string.\"    \"Well?\" said Rachel, turning to Langholm when her host became a busy  man once more.    \"I should make her guilty,\" said the novelist; \"and she would marry a  man who believed in her innocence, and he wouldn't care two pins when  she told him the truth in the last chapter, and they would live happily  ever afterwards. Nobody would touch the serial rights. But that would be  a book!\"    \"Then do you think she really was guilty?\"    And Rachel waited while he shrugged, her heart beating for no good  reason that she knew, except that she rather liked Mr. Langholm, and did  not wish to cease liking him on the spot. But it was to him that the  answer was big with fate; and he trifled and dallied with the issue of  the moment, little dreaming what a mark it was to leave upon his life,  while the paradox beloved of the literary took shape on his tongue.    \"What does it matter what she was? What do the facts matter, Mrs. Steel,  when one has an idea like that for fiction? Fiction is truer than fact!\"    \"But you haven't answered my question.\"    Rachel meant to have that answer.    \"Oh, well, as a matter of fact, I read the case pretty closely, and I  was thankful the jury brought in an acquittal. It required a little  imagination, but the truth always does. It is no treason to our host to  whisper that he has none. I remember having quite a heated argument with  him at the time. Oh, dear, no; she was no more guilty than you or I; but  it would be a thousand times more artistic if she were; and I should  make her so, by Jove!\"    Rachel finished her dinner in great tranquillity after this; but there  was a flush upon her face which had not been there before, and Langholm  received an astonishing smile when the ladies rose. He had been making  tardy atonement for his neglect of the aquiline lady, but Rachel had the  last word with him.    \"You will come and see us, won't you?\" she said. \"I shall want to hear  how the plot works out.\"    \"I am afraid it's one I can't afford to use,\" he said, \"unless I stick  to foolish fact and make her innocent.\"    And she left him with a wry face, her own glowing again.    \"You looked simply great--especially towards the end,\" whispered Morna  Woodgate in the drawing-room, for she alone knew how nervous Rachel had  been about what was indeed her social debut in Delverton.    The aquiline lady also had a word to say. Her eyes were like brown  beads, and her nose very long, which gave her indeed a hawk-like  appearance, somewhat unusual in a woman; but her gravity was rather that  of the owl.    \"You talked a great deal to Mr. Langholm,\" said she, sounding her rebuke  rather cleverly in the key of mere statement of fact. \"Have you read his  books, Mrs. Steel?\"    \"Some of them,\" said Rachel; \"haven't you?\"    \"Oh, no, I never read novels, unless it be George Eliot, or in these  days Mrs. Humphrey Ward. It's such waste of time when there are  Browning, Ruskin, and Carlyle to read and read again. I know I shouldn't  like Mr. Langholm's; I am sure they are dreadfully uncultured and  sensational.\"    \"But I like sensation,\" Rachel said. \"I like to be taken out of myself.\"    \"So you suggested he should write a novel about Mrs. Minchin!\"    \"No, I didn't suggest it,\" said Rachel, hurriedly; but the beady brown  eyes were upon her, and she felt herself reddening horribly as she  spoke.    \"You seemed to know all about her,\" said the aquiline lady. \"I'm not in  the habit of reading such cases. But I must really look this one up.\"          CHAPTER XII    EPISODE OF THE INVISIBLE VISITOR      That was something like a summer, as the saying is, and for once they  could say it even on the bleak northern spurs of the Delverton Hills.  There were days upon days when that minor chain looked blue and noble as  the mountains of Alsace and hackneyed song, seen with an envious eye  from the grimy outskirts of Northborough, and when from the hills  themselves the only blot upon the fair English landscape was the pall of  smoke that always overhung the town. On such days Normanthorpe House  justified its existence in the north of England instead of in southern  Italy; the marble hall, so chill to the tread at the end of May, was the  one really cool spot in the district by the beginning of July; and  nowhere could a more delightful afternoon be spent by those who cared to  avail themselves of a general invitation.    The Steels had not as yet committed themselves to formal hospitality of  the somewhat showy character that obtained in the neighborhood, but they  kept open house for all who liked to come, and whom they themselves  liked well enough to ask in the first instance. And here (as in some  other matters) this curious pair discovered a reflex identity of taste,  rare enough in the happiest of conventional couples, but a gratuitous  irony in the makers of a merely nominal marriage. Their mutual feelings  towards each other were a quantity unknown to either; but about a third  person they were equally outspoken and unanimous. Thus they had fewer  disagreements than many a loving couple, and perhaps more points of  insignificant contact, while all the time there was not even the  pretence of love between them. Their lives made a chasm bridged by  threads.    This was not seen by more than two of their acquaintance. Morna Woodgate  had both the observation and the opportunities to see a little how the  land lay between them. Charles Langholm had the experience and the  imagination to guess a good deal. But it was little enough that Morna  saw, and Langholm's guesses were as wide of the mark as only the guesses  of an imaginative man can be.

How observing you are,\" said Betty, giving him a little  sidelong glance. \"Well, he is very agreeable, and he dances better  than many of the young men.\"    \"I wonder if Wetzel got the turkey. I have heard no more shots,\"  said Alfred, showing plainly that he wished to change the subject.    \"Oh, look there! Quick!\" exclaimed Betty, pointing toward the  hillside.    He looked in the direction indicated and saw a doe and a spotted  fawn wading into the shallow water. The mother stood motionless a  moment, with head erect and long ears extended. Then she drooped her  graceful head and drank thirstily of the cool water. The fawn  splashed playfully round while its mother was drinking. It would  dash a few paces into the stream and then look back to see if its  mother approved. Evidently she did not, for she would stop her  drinking and call the fawn back to her side with a soft, crooning  noise. Suddenly she raised her head, the long ears shot up, and she  seemed to sniff the air. She waded through the deeper water to get  round a rocky bluff which ran out into the creek. Then she turned  and called the little one. The fawn waded until the water reached  its knees, then stopped and uttered piteous little bleats.  Encouraged by the soft crooning it plunged into the deep water and  with great splashing and floundering managed to swim the short  distance. Its slender legs shook as it staggered up the bank.  Exhausted or frightened, it shrank close to its mother. Together  they disappeared in the willows which fringed the side of the hill.    \"Was not that little fellow cute? I have had several fawns, but have  never had the heart to keep them,\" said Betty. Then, as Alfred made  no motion to speak, she continued:    \"You do not seem very talkative.\"    \"I have nothing to say. You will think me dull. The fact is when I  feel deepest I am least able to express myself.\"    \"I will read to you.\" said Betty taking up the book. He lay back  against the grassy bank and gazed dreamily at the many hued trees on  the little hillside; at the bare rugged sides of McColloch's Rock  which frowned down upon them. A silver-breasted eagle sailed slowly  round and round in the blue sky, far above the bluff. Alfred  wondered what mysterious power sustained that solitary bird as he  floated high in the air without perceptible movement of his broad  wings. He envied the king of birds his reign over that illimitable  space, his far-reaching vision, and his freedom. Round and round the  eagle soared, higher and higher, with each perfect circle, and at  last, for an instant poising as lightly as if he were about to perch  on his lonely crag, he arched his wings and swooped down through the  air with the swiftness of a falling arrow.    Betty's low voice, the water rushing so musically over the falls,  the great yellow leaves falling into the pool, the gentle breeze  stirring the clusters of goldenrod--all came softly to Alfred as he  lay there with half closed eyes.    The time slipped swiftly by as only such time can.    \"I fear the melancholy spirit of the day has prevailed upon you,\"  said Betty, half wistfully. \"You did not know I had stopped reading,  and I do not believe you heard my favorite poem. I have tried to  give you a pleasant afternoon and have failed.\"    \"No, no,\" said Alfred, looking at her with a blue flame in his eyes.  \"The afternoon has been perfect. I have forgotten my role, and have  allowed you to see my real self, something I have tried to hide from  all.\"    \"And are you always sad when you are sincere?\"    \"Not always. But I am often sad. Is it any wonder? Is not all nature  sad? Listen! There is the song of the oriole. Breaking in on the  stillness it is mournful. The breeze is sad, the brook is sad, this  dying Indian summer day is sad. Life itself is sad.\"    \"Oh, no. Life is beautiful.\"    \"You are a child,\" said he, with a thrill in his deep voice \"I hope  you may always be as you are to-day, in heart, at least.\"    \"It grows late. See, the shadows are falling. We must go.\"    \"You know I am going away to-morrow. I don't want to go. Perhaps  that is why I have been such poor company today. I have a  presentiment of evil I am afraid I may never come back.\"    \"I am sorry you must go.\"    \"Do you really mean that?\" asked Alfred, earnestly, bending toward  her \"You know it is a very dangerous undertaking. Would you care if  I never returned?\"    She looked up and their eyes met. She had raised her head haughtily,  as if questioning his right to speak to her in that manner, but as  she saw the unspoken appeal in his eyes her own wavered and fell  while a warm color crept into her cheek.    \"Yes, I would be sorry,\" she said, gravely. Then, after a moment:  \"You must portage the canoe round the falls, and from there we can  paddle back to the path.\"    The return trip made, they approached the house. As they turned the  corner they saw Colonel Zane standing at the door talking to Wetzel.    They saw that the Colonel looked pale and distressed, and the face  of the hunter was dark and gloomy.    \"Lew, did you get my turkey?\" said Betty, after a moment of  hesitation. A nameless fear filled her breast.    For answer Wetzel threw back the flaps of his coat and there at his  belt hung a small tuft of black hair. Betty knew at once it was the  scalp-lock of an Indian. Her face turned white and she placed a hand  on the hunter's arm.    \"What do you mean? That is an Indian's scalp. Lew, you look so  strange. Tell me, is it because we went off in the canoe and have  been in danger?\"    \"Betty, Isaac has been captured again,\" said the Colonel.    \"Oh, no, no, no,\" cried Betty in agonized tones, and wringing her  hands. Then, excitedly, \"Something can be done; you must pursue  them. Oh, Lew, Mr. Clarke, cannot you rescue him? They have not had  time to go far.\"    \"Isaac went to the chestnut grove this morning. If he had stayed  there he would not have been captured. But he went far into the  Black Forest. The turkey call we heard across the creek was made by  a Wyandot concealed in the cave. Lewis tells me that a number of  Indians have camped there for days. He shot the one who was calling  and followed the others until he found where they had taken Isaac's  trail.\"    Betty turned to the younger man with tearful eyes, and with  beseeching voice implored them to save her brother.    \"I am ready to follow you,\" said Clarke to Wetzel.    The hunter shook his head, but did not answer.    \"It is that hateful White Crane,\" passionately burst out Betty, as  the Colonel's wife led her weeping into the house.    \"Did you get more than one shot at them?\" asked Clarke.    The hunter nodded, and the slight, inscrutable smile flitted across  his stern features. He never spoke of his deeds. For this reason  many of the thrilling adventures which he must have had will forever  remain unrevealed. That evening there was sadness at Colonel Zane's  supper table. They felt the absence of the Colonel's usual spirits,  his teasing of Betty, and his cheerful conversation. He had nothing  to say. Betty sat at the table a little while, and then got up and  left the room saying she could not eat. Jonathan, on hearing of his  brother's recapture, did not speak, but retired in gloomy silence.  Silas was the only one of the family who was not utterly depressed.  He said it could have been a great deal worse; that they must make  the best of it, and that the sooner Isaac married his Indian  Princess the better for his scalp and for the happiness of all  concerned.    \"I remember Myeerah very well,\" he said. \"It was eight years ago,  and she was only a child. Even then she was very proud and willful,  and the loveliest girl I ever laid eyes on.\"    Alfred Clarke staid late at Colonel Zane's that night. Before going  away for so many weeks he wished to have a few more moments alone  with Betty. But a favorable opportunity did not present itself  during the evening, so when he had bade them all goodbye and  goodnight, except Betty, who opened the door for him, he said softly  to her:    \"It is bright moonlight outside. Come, please, and walk to the gate  with me.\"    A full moon shone serenely down on hill and dale, flooding the  valley with its pure white light and bathing the pastures in its  glory; at the foot of the bluff the waves of the river gleamed like  myriads of stars all twinkling and dancing on a bed of snowy clouds.  Thus illumined the river wound down the valley, its brilliance  growing fainter and fainter until at last, resembling the shimmering  of a silver thread which joined the earth to heaven, it disappeared  in the horizon.    \"I must say goodbye,\" said Alfred, as they reached the gate.    \"Friends must part. I am sorry you must go, Mr. Clarke, and I trust  you may return safe. It seems only yesterday that you saved my  brother's life, and I was so grateful and happy. Now he is gone.\"    \"You should not think about it so much nor brood over it,\" answered  the young man. \"Grieving will not bring him back nor do you any  good. It is not nearly so bad as if he had been captured by some  other tribe. Wetzel assures us that Isaac was taken alive. Please do  not grieve.\"    \"I have cried until I cannot cry any more. I am so unhappy. We were  children together, and I have always loved him better than any one  since my mother died. To have him back again and then to lose him!  Oh! I cannot bear it.\"    She covered her face with her hands and a low sob escaped her.    \"Don't, don't grieve,\" he said in an unsteady voice, as he took the  little hands in his and pulled them away from her face.    Betty trembled. Something in his voice, a tone she had never heard  before startled her. She looked up at him half unconscious that he  still held her hands in his. Never had she appeared so lovely.    \"You cannot understand my feelings.\"    \"I loved my mother.\"    \"B"]]]
