Its geographical  distribution coincided with that of the llama and alpaca, whose chief  pasturage it furnished.[120] In contrast, the absence of any wild fodder  plants in Japan, and the exclusion of all foreign forms by the  successful competition of the native bamboo grass have together  eliminated pastoral life from the economic history of the island.    The Old World, on the other hand, furnished an abundant supply of  indigenous animals susceptible of domestication, and especially those  fitted for nomadic life, such as the camel, horse, ass, sheep and goat.  Hence it produced in the widespread grasslands and deserts of Europe,  Asia, and Africa the most perfect types of pastoral development in its  natural or nomadic form. Moreover, the early history of the civilized  agricultural peoples of these three continents reveals their previous  pastoral mode of life.    North and South America offered over most of their area conditions of  climate and soil highly favorable to agriculture, and a fair list of  indigenous cereals, tubers, and pulses yielding goodly crops even to  superficial tillage. Maize especially was admirably suited for a race of  semi-migratory hunters. It could be sown without plowing, ripened in a  warm season even in ninety days, could be harvested without a sickle and  at the pleasure of the cultivator, and needed no preparation beyond  roasting before it was ready for food.[121] The beans and pumpkins which  the Indians raised also needed only a short season. Hence many Indian  tribes, while showing no trace of pastoral development, combined with  the chase a semi-nomadic agriculture; and in a few districts where  geographic conditions had applied peculiar pressure, they had  accomplished the transition to sedentary agriculture.    [Sidenote: Land per capita under various cultural and geographic  conditions.]    Every advance to a higher state of civilization has meant a progressive  decrease in the amount of land necessary for the support of the  individual, and a progressive increase in the relations between man and  his habitat. The stage of social development remaining the same, the per  capita amount of land decreases also from poorer to better endowed  geographical districts, and with every invention which brings into use  some natural resource. The following classification[122] illustrates the  relation of density of population to various geographic and  socio-economic conditions.    Hunter tribes on the outskirts of the habitable area, as in Arctic  America and Siberia, require from 70 to 200 square miles per capita; in  arid lands, like the Kalahari Desert and Patagonia, 40 to 200 square  miles per capita; in choice districts and combining with the chase some  primitive agriculture, as did the Cherokee, Shawnee and Iroquois  Indians, the Dyaks of Borneo and the Papuans of New Guinea, 1/2 to 2  square miles per capita.    Pastoral nomads show a density of from 2 to 5 to the square mile;  practicing some agriculture, as in Kordofan and Sennar districts of  eastern Sudan, 10 to 15 to the square mile. Agriculture, undeveloped but  combined with some trade and industry as in Equatorial Africa, Borneo  and most of the Central American states, supports 5 to 15 to the square  mile; practised with European methods in young or colonial lands, as in  Arkansas, Texas, Minnesota, Hawaii, Canada and Argentine, or in European  lands with unfavorable climate, up to 25 to the square mile.    Pure agricultural lands of central Europe support 100 to the square  mile, and those of southern Europe, 200; when combining some industry,  from 250 to 300. But these figures rise to 500 or more in lowland India  and China. Industrial districts of modern Europe, such as England,  Belgium, Saxony, Departments Nord and Rhone in France, show a density of  500 to 800 to the square mile. [See maps pages 8 and 9.]    [Sidenote: Density of population and government.]    With every increase of the population inhabiting a given area, and with  the consequent multiplication and constriction of the bonds uniting  society with its land, comes a growing necessity for a more highly  organized government, both to reduce friction within and to secure to  the people the land on which and by which they live. Therefore  protection becomes a prime function of the state. It wards off outside  attack which may aim at acquisition of its territory, or an invasion of  its rights, or curtailment of its geographic sphere of activity. The  modern industrial state, furthermore, with the purpose of strengthening  the nation, assists or itself undertakes the construction of highways,  canals, and railroads, and the maintenance of steamship lines. These  encourage the development of natural resources and of commerce, and  hence lay the foundation for an increased population, by multiplying the  relations between land and people.    [Sidenote: Territorial expansion of the state.]    A like object is attained by territorial expansion, which often follows  in the wake of commercial expansion. This strengthens the nation  positively by enlarging its geographic base, and negatively by forcing  back the boundaries of its neighbors. The expansion of the Thirteen  Colonies from the Atlantic slope to the Mississippi River and the Great  Lakes by the treaty concluding the Revolution was a strong guarantee of  the survival of the young Republic against future aggressions either of  England or Spain, though it exchanged the scientific or protecting  boundary of the Appalachian Mountains for the unscientific and exposed  boundary of a river. The expansion to the Rocky Mountains by the  Louisiana purchase not only gave wider play to national energies,  stimulated natural increase of population, and attracted immigration,  but it eliminated a dangerous neighbor in the French, and placed a wide  buffer of untenanted land between the United States and the petty  aggressions of the Spanish in Mexico. Rome's expansion into the valley  of the Po, as later into Trans-Alpine Gaul and Germany, had for its  purpose the protection of the peninsula against barbarian inroads.  Japan's recent aggression against the Russians in the Far East was  actuated by the realization that she had to expand into Korea at the  cost of Muscovite ascendency, or contract later at the cost of her own  independence.    [Sidenote: Checks to population.]    If a state lacks the energy and national purpose, like Italy, or the  possibility, like Switzerland, for territorial expansion, and accepts  its boundaries as final, the natural increase of population upon a fixed  area produces an increased density, unless certain social forces  counteract it. Without these forces, the relation of men to the land  would have tended to modify everywhere in the same way. Increase in  numbers would have been attended by a corresponding decrease in the  amount of land at the disposal of each individual. Those states which,  like Norway and Switzerland, cannot expand and which have exploited  their natural resources to the utmost, must resign themselves to the  emigration of their redundant population. But those which have remained  within their own boundaries and have adopted a policy of isolation, like  China, feudal Japan during its two and a half centuries of seclusion,  and numerous Polynesian islands, have been forced to war with nature  itself by checking the operation of the law of natural increase. All the  repulsive devices contributing to this end, whether infanticide,  abortion, cannibalism, the sanctioned murder of the aged and infirm,  honorable suicide, polyandry or persistent war, are the social  deformities consequent upon suppressed growth. Such artificial checks  upon population are more conspicuous in natural regions with sharply  defined boundaries, like islands and oases, as Malthus observed;[123] but  they are visible also among savage tribes whose boundaries are fixed not  by natural features but by the mutual repulsion and rivalry  characterizing the stage of development, and whose limit of population  is reduced by their low economic status.    [Sidenote: Extra-territorial relations.]    There is a great difference between those states whose inhabitants  subsist exclusively from the products of their own country and those  which rely more or less upon other lands. Great industrial states, like  England and Germany, which derive only a portion of their food and raw  material from their own territory, supply their dense populations  through international trade. Interruption of such foreign commerce is  disastrous to the population at home; hence the state by a navy protects  the lines of communication with those far-away lands of wheat fields and  cattle ranch. This is no purely modern development. Athens in the time  of Pericles used her navy not only to secure her political domination in  the Aegean, but also her connections with the colonial wheat lands  about the Euxine.    The modern state strives to render this circle of trade both large and  permanent by means of commercial treaties, customs-unions, trading-posts  and colonies. Thus while society at home is multiplying its relations  with its own land, the state is enabling it to multiply also its  relations with the whole producing world. While at home the nation is  becoming more closely knit together through the common bond of the  fatherland, in the world at large humanity is evolving a brotherhood of  man by the union of each with all through the common growing bond of the  earth. Hence we cannot avoid the question: Are we in process of evolving  a social idea vaster than that underlying nationality? Do the Socialists  hint to us the geographic basis of this new development, when they  describe themselves as an international political party?

They liked her Bohemianism, her wit, her geniality,  her audacious slang, and her collection of droll epithets that  fittingly described her venomous critics of a self-appointed nobility.  When she could not reach the heights of such superior persons she  proceeded to ridicule them with a tongue that rattled out vivid  invective which outmatched anything they could say of _her_. It  probably made her more enemies, but it satisfied her temper and  pleased her admirers. She never appears to have been conscious of any  inferiority in herself. We are inclined to agree with the opinion  expressed by the naval lieutenant at Naples, who said \"She was a very  handsome, vulgar woman.\" All her portraits confirm what the sailor  says about her beauty, and the most reliable records are confirmatory  so far as his view of her vulgarity is concerned.    But in any case, whatever may have been her physical dimensions, they  were not understated by the crowd who gave vent to their aversion in  this and in many other deplorable ways. There are only a few  evidences of Nelson being aware of and resenting some of the  disparaging remarks made about his \"wife in the sight of Heaven,\" and  these do not seem to have diminished his infatuation for her. He was  accustomed to say in connection with his professional duties that  whenever he followed his own head he was in general much more correct  in his judgment than by following other people's opinions. He carried  this plan into his private life so far as Emma was concerned, but men  and women who were his intimate friends would not support the view  that by following his head in _this_ particular case his judgment was  sound. We may term the infatuation a deteriorated state of mind, but  _he_ was sustained by the belief that she was a spirit unto him while  he lived, and with his last gasp, as he was passing into the shadows,  he bestowed her as a legacy to his country. We shall have something to  say hereafter as to how the British Government dealt with their great  Admiral's dying injunction.    The Neapolitan atmosphere was vile enough, and might well have made  even men and women who knew the loose side of life shrink from it, but  it can never be claimed that it had a demoralizing influence on Emma,  who at an early age became familiar with unspeakable vices which left  her little to learn at the time Greville sold her to his uncle, who  took her to a centre of sordid uncleanness, there to become his wife  after a brief association as his mistress. We may have no misgiving as  to her aptitude in acquiring anything she chose that was left for her  to learn from a community of debauchees and parasites.    The wonder is that her brain did not succumb to the poisonous  influences by which she was surrounded, and that the poor girl did not  sink into the depths of that luxurious sensuality which characterized  Neapolitan society at that time. It was a more distinguished and  fascinating type of debauchery than that which she had known in other  days in England, and from which Greville had rescued her. The  temptation to plunge into the boisterous merriment of a higher order  of depravity than that to which she had been accustomed must have been  very great to such a temperament as hers. But she worthily kept her  wild, wayward spirit under restraint, and, according to Sir William  Hamilton, she conducted herself in a way that caused him to be  satisfied with his reforming guidance. She adapted herself to the ways  of the more select social community of her new existence, and at the  time Nelson made her acquaintance she had really become a creditable  member of the society in which she moved. In every respect she was  congenial to him. He never lost a chance of applauding her gifts and  brazenly exempting himself from all moral restrictions, except, as I  have said before, when he was seized with a spontaneous fit of  goodness. He would then clumsily try to conceal the passion that  obsessed him. He did not brood long over trifles of this kind, merely  because he had lost, if ever he possessed, the power of consecutive  reasoning in matters of moral convention. His Neapolitan associates  were a cunning, lying, luxury-loving, depraved lot, and however  strongly his principles were fixed, there can be but one opinion--that  such an atmosphere was harmful to him. He speaks of Naples himself as  being a country of poets, whores, and scoundrels; and Southey does not  attempt to mince words, for in vigorous terms he describes England's  \"alliances to superannuated and abominable governments of the  Continent.\" These are the states that we shed British blood and  squandered British money over, and in truth Southey describes them as  they were!    The King of Naples was a great hero to stand up against the bravest,  best-trained troops the world! He shivered at the thought of Nelson  going out of his sight, and whimpered him into staying to guard him  and his rotten kingdom. It was at this period of his gallant activity  that Nelson became the victim of fulsome flattery and the associate of  the most cunning, knavish charlatans in the world. These creatures  never ceased to inveigh against the wrongs they were suffering for the  uplifting of human rights, and because their great British ally was in  need of their disinterested and distinguished co-ordination. Nelson  was well aware of all this, but could not shake himself free. He  loathed the slavering way in which flattery was extended to him,  because it had a sickly resemblance to weeping. He declares of the  Neapolitan officers, \"They are boasters of the highest order, and when  they are confronted with the duty of defending hearth and home, their  courage ends in vapour.\" He avers that they \"cannot lose honour, as  they have none to lose,\" and yet he makes no serious effort to  unshackle himself from a detestable position. Emma, the Queen, and  King of Naples, and others, have a deep-rooted hold on him, and he  cannot give up the cheap popularity of the Neapolitans. He persuades  himself that the whole thought of his soul is \"Down, down, with the  French,\" and that it shall be his \"constant prayer.\" Throughout the  whole course of his brilliant career it was never doubted that the  French were his great aversion, because they were his country's  enemies. But the hysterical tears of Lady Hamilton and those of the  Neapolitan Queen proved too strong for him. The King's beseeching  fears were also added to an already difficult situation, which, he  persuaded himself, could not be ignored without damaging the interests  he was sent to protect; so his stay in the reeking cesspool of  Neapolitanism was prolonged, but there is no reason for supposing that  his \"constant prayer\" for the extinction of the French was any the  less ardent. The fatal day of their catastrophe was only postponed.  The praying went on all the same, with more or less belief in the  Almighty's preference for Englishmen.      VIII    This is a form of cant to which those whom we regard as great men are  a prey. But this pride of race is not confined to the mighty men of  valour. The humble soldier and sailor, and poorest and richest of  civilians, have the same inherent belief in British superiority. They  talk to the Great Giver of all power in the most patronizing way, and  while they profess to believe in His ordinances they treat them as  though He were their vassal and not their Lawgiver. They call upon Him  to break His own laws and help them to smite those whom they regard as  enemies, never doubting the righteousness of their cause. The enemy,  on the other hand, believe that _they_ have a monopoly of God, and  avow that _their_ cause is His, and _being_ His, they grimly ask Him  to settle the dispute by coming down on their side; but should they  win the fight, the glory of it is seldom given to the Power whose  assistance is implored, but ascribed to their own genius.    Cromwell is a singular and distinguished exception. He always gave all  the glory to God. Take as an example the battle of Dunbar (though  there are many instances of a similar character that could be quoted  during the Civil War). The battle-cry of the Parliament forces was  \"The Lord of Hosts,\" and at the opportune moment the commander of the  Parliament army shouted, \"Now let God arise, and His enemies shall be  scattered.\" The Ironsides made a fearless and irresistible rush at  their foes, and almost immediately Cromwell saw the Covenanters in  confusion; again he shouted, \"They run! I profess they run!\" The  quotation from the 68th Psalm was always an inspiration to these  religious warriors. Old Leslie, the Scotch Covenanting general, with  the patience of stupidity, had been mumbling petitions for hours to  the God of the Anointed to form an alliance with him to crush the  unholy rebellion against King and Covenant. \"Thou knowest, O God, how  just our cause is, and how unjust is that of those who are not Thy  people.\" This moth-eaten crowd of canting hypocrites were no match for  the forces who believed that they were backed by the Lord of Hosts,  and they were completely routed.    Sir Jacob Astley, another Royalist, on one occasion during the Civil  War breathed a simple prayer with uplifted eyes. \"O Lord,\" said he,  \"Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not  Thou forget me.\" Then he gave the word of command to \"March.\" He was  nevertheless defeated at Stow, and seems to have been offended at the  Deity for His forgetfulness, as he bitterly reproached his conquerors  by telling them that they might go to play unless they fell out  amongst themselves.    Napoleon carried on warfare under a sterner and more self-reliant  code. He had confidence in and depended on his own genius and on  nature's laws. There are shoals of"]]]
