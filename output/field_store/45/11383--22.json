Under the  corn-bin lies a lady who had two husbands and fifteen children,  _Antigone in parentes, Porcia in conjuges, Sempronia in liberos_; while  a few yards further east, less agreeably placed, is an ecclesiastic of  the Gorrevod family, who reckoned Prince and Bishop and Baron among his  titles. The nave of this Church of S. Michael accommodates thirty  horses, and the north aisle thirteen; the south is considered more  select, and is boarded off for the decani, in the shape of officers'  chargers. The north side of the chancel gives room for six horses, and  the south side for a row of saddle-blocks. It had been an oversight on  the part of the original architect of the church that no place was  prepared for the daily hay; a fault which the military restorers have  remedied by improvising a lady-chapel, where the hay for the day is  placed in the morning. With Spelman in my mind, I asked if the stables  were not unhealthy; but the soldiers said they were the healthiest in  the town.[45]    The Glaciere of Vaise had proved, as has been seen, to be a  mare's-nest; and yet, after all, it produced a foal; for while I was  endeavouring to overcome the evening heat of Besancon in a  _specialite_ for ice, I found that the owner of the establishment was  also the owner of the two glacieres of Vaise; and in the course of the  conversation which followed, he told me of the existence of a natural  glaciere near the village of Arc-sous-Cicon, twenty kilometres from  Pontarlier, which he had himself seen. As I had arranged to meet my  sisters at Neufchatel, in two days' time, for the purpose of visiting  a glaciere in the Val de Travers, this piece of information came very  opportunely, and I determined to attempt both glacieres with them.    Some of the trains from Besancon stop for an hour at Dole in passing  towards Switzerland by way of Pontarlier, and anyone who is interested  in the Burgundian and Spanish wars of France should take this  opportunity of seeing what may be seen of the town of Dole and its  massive church-tower. The sieges of Dole made it very famous in the  later middle ages, more especially the long siege under Charles  d'Amboise, at the crisis of which that general recommended his soldiers  to leave a few of the people for seed,[46] and the old sobriquet _la  Joyeuse_ was punningly changed to _la Dolente_. It has had other claims  upon fame; for if Besancon possessed one of the two most authentic Holy  Shrouds, Dole was the resting-place of one of the undoubted miraculous  Hosts, which had withstood the flames in the Abbey of Faverney. It was  for the reception of this Host that the advocates of the Brotherhood of  Monseigneur Saint Yves built the Sainte Chapelle at Dole.[47]      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 38: One of the rights of the sovereigns of Burgundy was known  by this name. The sovereign had the power of sending one soldier  incapacitated by war to each abbey in the County, and the authorities of  the abbey were bound to make him a prebendary for life. In 1602, after  the siege of Ostend, the Archduke Albert exercised this right in favour  of his wounded soldiers, forcing lay-prebendaries upon almost all the  abbeys of the County of Burgundy. The Archduchess Isabella attempted to  quarter such a prebendary upon the Abbey of Migette, a house of nuns,  but the inmates successfully refused to receive the warrior among them  (Dunod, _Hist. de l'Eglise de Besancon_, i. 367). For the similar right  in the kingdom of France, see Pasquier, _Recherches de la France_, l.  xii. p. 37. Louis XIV. did not exercise this right after his conquest of  the Franche Comte, perhaps because the Hotel des Invalides, to which the  Church was so large a contributor, met all his wants.]    [Footnote 39: '_Quand on veut du poisson, il se faut mouiller_;'  referring probably to the method of taking trout practised in the Ormont  valley, the habitat of the purest form of the patois. A man wades in the  Grand' Eau, with a torch in one hand to draw the fish to the top, and a  sword in the other to kill them when they arrive there; a second man  wading behind with a bag, to pick up the pieces.]    [Footnote 40: 'Swift-foot Almond, and land-louping Braan.']    [Footnote 41: The sentry-box is omitted in the accompanying  illustration.]    [Footnote 42: Believed to be derived from _Collis Dianae_. Dunod found  that _Chaudonne_ was an early form of the name, and so preferred _Collis  Dominarum_, with reference to the house of nuns placed there.]    [Footnote 43: Schmidt was not without the support of example in the  indulgence of his warlike tastes. Thirty-eight years before, the  religious took so active a part in the defence of Dole against Louis  XIII., that the Capuchin Father d'Iche had the direction of the  artillery; and when an officer of the enemy had seized the Brother  Claude by the cowl, the Father Barnabas made the officer loose his hold  by slaying him with a demi-pique. When Arbois was besieged by Henry IV.,  the Sieur Chanoine Pecauld is specially mentioned as proving himself a  _bon harquebouzier._]    [Footnote 44: There is a painting by Vander Meulen, representing this  siege, in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.]    [Footnote 45: The Church of S. Philibert, in Dijon, now a forage  magazine, has an inscription let into the wall almost ludicrously out of  keeping with the present desecrated state of the building,--_Dilexi  Domine Decorem Domus tuae_, 1648.]    [Footnote 46: 'Qu'on les laisse pour grain!']    [Footnote 47: In the year 1648, it was suspected that some decay was  going on in the material of this Host, and the following translation  from the Latin describes the investigation entered into by the Dean and  a large body of clergy and laity, in order to quiet the public  mind:--'Apres que tous les susnommes (viz. the Dean, Canons, President  of the Parliament, &c.) etant presents eurent adores le S. Sacrement, la  custode fut ouverte avec tout le respect possible; et alors le dit Doyen  apercut un vermisseau roule en spirale, qu'il saisit avec la pointe  d'une epingle et placa sur un corporal ou chacun l'examina; puis on le  brula avec un charbon pris dans l'encensoir, et ses cendres furent  jetees dans la piscine. On put alors constater tout le dommage que ce  miserable petit animal avait cause aux especes sacrees dont les debris  ici tombaient en poussiere, la se trouvaient ronges et laceres, de telle  sorte que l'Hostie n'avait presque plus rien de sa forme circulaire, et  presentait de profondes decoupures partout ou le vermisseau s'etait  livre a ses sinueus es evolutions.']             *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER VII.    THE GLACIERE OF MONTHEZY, IN THE VAL DE TRAVERS.      I rejoined my sisters at Neufchatel on the 5th of July, and proceeded  thence with them by the line which passes through the Val de Travers.  One of them had been at Fleurier, in 1860, on the day of the opening of  this line, and she added an interest to the various tunnels, by telling  us that a Swiss gentleman of her acquaintance, who had taken a place in  one of the open carriages of the first train, found, on reaching the  daylight after one of the tunnels, that his neighbour had been killed by  a small stone which had fallen on to his head. Where the stone came  from, no one could say, nor yet when it fell, for the unfortunate man  had made no sign or movement of any kind.    Every one must be delighted with the wonders of the line of rail, and  the beauties through which the engineer has cut his way. In valleys on a  less magnificent scale, cuttings and embankments on the face of the hill  are sad eyesores, as in railway-ruined Killiecrankie; but here Nature's  works are so very grand, that the works of man are not offensively  prominent, being overawed by the very facts over which they have  triumphed. When we reached the more even part of the valley, where the  Reuse no longer roars and rushes far below, but winds quietly through  the soft grass on a level with the rail, the whole grouping was so  exceedingly charming, and the river itself so suggestive of lusty trout,  and the village of Noiraigue[48] looked so tempting as it nestled in a  sheltered nook among the headlong precipices, that I registered in a  safe mental pigeon-hole a week at the auberge there with a fishing-rod,  and excursions to the commanding summit in which the _Creux de Vent_ is  found. The engine-driver knew that he was in a region of beauties, and,  when he whistled to warn his passengers that the train was about to move  on, he remained stationary until the long-resounding echoes died out,  floating lingeringly up the valley to neighbouring France.    We had no definite idea as to the _locale_ of the glaciere we were now  bent upon attacking. M. Thury's list gave the following  information:--'_Glaciere de Motiers, Canton de Neufchatel, entre les  vallees de Travers et de la Brevine, pres du sentier de la Brevine_;'  and this I had rendered somewhat more precise by a cross-examination of  the guard of the train on my way to Besancon. He had not heard of the  glaciere, but from what I told him he was inclined to think that Couvet  would be the best station for our purpose, especially as the 'Ecu' at  that place was, in his eyes, a commendable hostelry. Some one in Geneva,  also, had believed that Couvet was as likely as anything else in the  valley; so at Couvet we descended.[49]    This is a very clean and cheerful village, devoted to the lucrative  manufacture of _absinthe_, and producing inhabitants who look like  gentlemen and ladies, and promenade the ways in bonnets and hats,  after a most un-Swiss-like fashion. They carefully restrict  themselves to the making of the poisonous product of their village,  and have nothing to do with the consumption thereof:[50] hence nature  has a fair chance with them, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14020"],[0,"The Works of Horace (#18)"],[1,"blood is devoted to  perdition, shall destroy her: and this land shall again be possessed by  wild beasts. The victorious barbarian, alas! shall trample upon the  ashes of the city, and the horsemen shall smite it with the sounding  hoofs; and (horrible to see!) he shall insultingly disperse the bones of  Romulus, which [as yet] are free from the injuries of wind and sun.  Perhaps you all in general, or the better part of you, are inquisitive  to know, what may be expedient, in order to escape [such] dreadful  evils. There can be no determination better than this; namely, to go  wherever our feet will carry us, wherever the south or boisterous  south-west shall summon us through the waves; in the same manner as the  state of the Phocaeans fled, after having uttered execrations [against  such as should return], and left their fields and proper dwellings and  temples to be inhabited by boars and ravenous wolves. Is this  agreeable? has any one a better scheme to advise? Why do we delay to go  on ship-board under an auspicious omen? But first let us swear to these  conditions--the stones shall swim upward, lifted from the bottom of the  sea, as soon as it shall not be impious to return; nor let it grieve us  to direct our sails homeward, when the Po shall wash the tops of the  Matinian summits; or the lofty Apennine shall remove into the sea, or a  miraculous appetite shall unite monsters by a strange kind of lust;  Insomuch that tigers may delight to couple with hinds, and the dove be  polluted with the kite; nor the simple herds may dread the brindled  lions, and the he-goat, grown smooth, may love the briny main. After  having sworn to these things, and whatever else may cut off the  pleasing: hope of returning, let us go, the whole city of us, or at  least that part which is superior to the illiterate mob: let the idle  and despairing part remain upon these inauspicious habitations. Ye, that  have bravery, away with effeminate grief, and fly beyond the Tuscan  shore. The ocean encircling the land awaits us; let us seek the happy  plains and prospering Islands, where the untilled land yearly produces  corn, and the unpruned vineyard punctually flourishes; and where the  branch of the never-failing olive blossoms forth, and the purple fig  adorns its native tree: honey distills from the hollow oaks; the light  water bounds down from the high mountains with a murmuring pace. There  the she-goats come to the milk-pails of their own accord, and the  friendly flock return with their udders distended; nor does the bear at  evening growl about the sheepfold, nor does the rising ground swell with  vipers; and many more things shall we, happy [Romans], view with  admiration: how neither the rainy east lays waste the corn-fields with  profuse showers, nor is the fertile seed burned by a dry glebe; the king  of gods moderating both [extremes]. The pine rowed by the Argonauts  never attempted to come hither; nor did the lascivious [Medea] of  Colchis set her foot [in this place]: hither the Sidonian mariners never  turned their sail-yards, nor the toiling crew of Ulysses. No contagious  distempers hurt the flocks; nor does the fiery violence of any  constellation scorch the herd. Jupiter set apart these shores for a  pious people, when he debased the golden age with brass: with brass,  then with iron he hardened the ages; from which there shall be a happy  escape for the good, according to my predictions.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XVII.    DIALOGUE BETWEEN HORACE AND CANIDIA.      Now, now I yield to powerful science; and suppliant beseech thee by the  dominions of Proserpine, and by the inflexible divinity of Diana, and by  the books of incantations able to call down the stars displaced from the  firmament; O Canidia, at length desist from thine imprecations, and  quickly turn, turn back thy magical machine. Telephus moved [with  compassion] the grandson of Nereus, against whom he arrogantly had put  his troops of Mysians in battle-array, and against whom he had darted  his sharp javelins. The Trojan matrons embalmed the body of the  man-slaying Hector, which had been condemned to birds of prey, and dogs,  after king [Priam], having left the walls of the city, prostrated  himself, alas! at the feet of the obstinate Achilles. The mariners of  the indefatigable Ulysses, put off their limbs, bristled with the hard  skins [of swine], at the will of Circe: then their reason and voice were  restored, and their former comeliness to their countenances. I have  suffered punishment enough, and more than enough, on thy account, O thou  so dearly beloved by the sailors and factors. My vigor is gone away, and  my ruddy complexion has left me; my bones are covered with a ghastly  skin; my hair with your preparations is grown hoary. No ease respites me  from my sufferings: night presses upon day, and day upon night: nor is  it in my power to relieve my lungs, which are strained with gasping.  Wherefore, wretch that I am, I am compelled to credit (what was denied,  by me) that the charms of the Samnites discompose the breast, and the  head splits in sunder at the Marsian incantations. What wouldst thou  have more? O sea! O earth! I burn in such a degree as neither Hercules  did, besmeared with the black gore of Nessus, nor the fervid flame  burning In the Sicilian Aetna. Yet you, a laboratory of Colchian  poisons, remain on fire, till I [reduced to] a dry ember, shall be  wafted away by the injurious winds. What event, or what penalty awaits  me? Speak out: I will with honor pay the demanded mulct; ready to make  an expiation, whether you should require a hundred steers, or chose to  be celebrated on a lying lyre. You, a woman of modesty, you, a woman of  probity, shall traverse the stars, as a golden constellation. Castor and  the brother of the great Castor, offended at the infamy brought on  [their sister] Helen, yet overcome by entreaty, restored to the poet his  eyes that were taken away from him. And do you (for it is in your power)  extricate me from this frenzy; O you, that are neither defiled by family  meanness, nor skillful to disperse the ashes of poor people, after they  have been nine days interred. You have an hospitable breast, and  unpolluted hands; and Pactumeius is your son, and thee the midwife has  tended; and, whenever you bring forth, you spring up with unabated  vigor.        CANIDIA'S ANSWER.      Why do you pour forth your entreaties to ears that are closely shut  [against them]? The wintery ocean, with its briny tempests, does not  lash rocks more deaf to the cries of the naked mariners. What, shall  you, without being made an example of, deride the Cotyttian mysteries,  sacred to unrestrained love, which were divulged [by you]? And shall  you, [assuming the office] of Pontiff [with regard to my] Esquilian  incantations, fill the city with my name unpunished? What did it avail  me to have enriched the Palignian sorceress [with my charms], and to  have prepared poison of greater expedition, if a slower fate awaits you  than is agreeable to my wishes? An irksome life shall be protracted by  you, wretch as you are, for this purpose, that you may perpetually be  able to endure new tortures. Tantalus, the perfidious sire of Pelops,  ever craving after the plenteous banquet [which is always before him],  wishes for respite; Prometheus, chained to the vulture, wishes [for  rest]; Sisyphus wishes to place the stone on the summit of the mountain:  but the laws of Jupiter forbid. Thus you shall desire at one time to  leap down from a high tower, at another to lay open your breast with the  Noric sword; and, grieving with your tedious indisposition, shall tie  nooses about your neck in vain. I at that time will ride on your odious  shoulders; and the whole earth shall acknowledge my unexampled power.  What shall I who can give motion to waxen images (as you yourself,  inquisitive as you are, were convinced of) and snatch the moon from  heaven by my incantations; I, who can raise the dead after they are  burned, and duly prepare the potion of love, shall I bewail the event of  my art having no efficacy upon you?           *       *       *       *       *        THE SECULAR POEM OF HORACE.    TO APOLLO AND DIANA.      Phoebus, and thou Diana, sovereign of the woods, ye illustrious  ornaments of the heavens, oh ever worthy of adoration, and ever adored,  bestow what we pray for at this sacred season: at which the Sibylline  verses have given directions, that select virgins and chaste youths  should sing a hymn to the deities, to whom the seven hills [of Rome] are  acceptable. O genial sun, who in your splendid car draw forth and  obscure the day, and who arise another and the same, may it never be in  your power to behold anything more glorious than the city of Rome! O  Ilithyia, of lenient power to produce the timely birth, protect the  matrons [in labor]; whether you choose the title of Lucina, or  Genitalis. O goddess multiply our offspring; and prosper the decrees of  the senate in relation to the joining of women in wedlock, and the  matrimonial law about to teem with a new race; that the stated  revolution of a hundred and ten years may bring back the hymns and the  games, three times by bright daylight restored to in crowds, and as  often in the welcome night. And you, ye fatal sisters, infallible in  having predicted what is established, and what the settled order of  things preserves, add propitious fates to those already past. Let the  earth, fertile in fruits and flocks, present Ceres with a sheafy crown;  may both salubrious rains and Jove's air cherish the young blood!  Apollo, mild and gentle with your sheathed arrows, hear the suppliant  youths: O moon, thou horned queen of stars, hear the virgins. If Rome be  your work, and the Trojan troops arrived on the Tuscan shore (the part,  commanded [by your oracles] to change their homes and city) by a  successful navigation: for"]]]
