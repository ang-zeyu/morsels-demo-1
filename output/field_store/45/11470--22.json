Thus there never was nor could be amity  between her and her sister and her foe, Elizabeth, who was justly  aggrieved by her assumption of the English arms, while Elizabeth  quartered the arms of France.  Again, the ratification of the Treaty as  regarded Mary's rebels depended on their fulfilling certain clauses  which, in fact, they instantly violated.    Preachers were planted in the larger town, some of which had already  secured their services; Knox took Edinburgh.  \"Superintendents,\"--by no  means bishops--were appointed, an order which soon ceased to exist in the  Kirk: their duties were to wander about in their provinces,  superintending and preaching.  By request of the Convention (which was  crowded by persons not used to attend), some preachers drew up, in four  days, a Confession of Faith, on the lines of Calvin's rule at Geneva:  this was approved and passed on August 17.  The makers of the document  profess their readiness to satisfy any critic of any point \"from the  mouth of God\" (out of the Bible), but the pace was so good that either no  criticism was offered or it was very rapidly \"satisfied.\"  On August 24  four acts were passed in which the authority of \"The Bishop of Rome\" was  repudiated.  All previous legislation, not consistent with the new  Confession, was rescinded.  Against celebrants and attendants of the Mass  were threatened (1) confiscation and corporal punishment; (2) exile; and  (3) for the third offence, Death.  The death sentence is not known to  have been carried out in more than one or two cases.  (Prof. Hume-Brown  writes that \"the penalties attached to the breach of these enactments\"  (namely, the abjuration of Papal jurisdiction, the condemnation of all  practices and doctrines contrary to the new creed, and of the celebration  of Mass in Scotland) \"were those approved and sanctioned by the example  of every country in Christendom.\"  But not, surely, for the same  offences, such as \"the saying or hearing of Mass\"?--' History of  Scotland,' ii. 71, 72: 1902.)  Suits in ecclesiastical were removed into  secular courts (August 29).    In the Confession the theology was that of Calvin.  Civil rulers were  admitted to be of divine institution, their duty is to \"suppress  idolatry,\" and they are not to be resisted \"when doing that which  pertains to their charge.\"  But a Catholic ruler, like Mary, or a  tolerant ruler, as James VI. would fain have been, apparently may be  resisted for his tolerance.  Resisted James was, as we shall see,  whenever he attempted to be lenient to Catholics.    The Book of Discipline, by Knox and other preachers, never was ratified  by the Estates, as the Confession of Faith had been.  It made admirable  provisions for the payment of preachers and teachers, for the  Universities, and for the poor; but somebody, probably Lethington, spoke  of the proposals as \"devout imaginations.\"  The Book of Discipline  approved of what was later accepted by the General Assembly, The Book of  Common Order in Public Worship.  This book was not a stereotyped Liturgy,  but it was a kind of guide to the ministers in public prayers: the  minister may repeat the prayers, or \"say something like in effect.\"  On  the whole, he prayed \"as the Spirit moved him,\" and he really seems to  have been regarded as inspired; his prayers were frequently political  addresses.  To silence these the infatuated policy of Charles I. thrust  the Laudian Liturgy on the nation.    The preachers were to be chosen by popular election, after examination in  knowledge and as to morals.  There was to be no ordination \"by laying on  of hands.\"  \"Seeing the miracle is ceased, the using of the ceremony we  deem not necessary\"; but, if the preachers were inspired, the miracle had  not ceased, and the ceremony was soon reinstated.  Contrary to Genevan  practice, such festivals as Christmas and Easter were abolished.  The  Scottish Sabbath was established in great majesty.  One \"rag of Rome\" was  retained, clerical excommunication--the Sword of Church Discipline.  It  was the cutting off from Christ of the excommunicated, who were handed  over to the devil, and it was attended by civil penalties equivalent to  universal boycotting, practical outlawry, and followed by hell fire:  \"which sentence, lawfully pronounced on earth, is ratified in heaven.\"  The strength of the preachers lay in this terrible weapon, borrowed from  the armoury of Rome.    Private morals were watched by the elders, and offenders were judged in  kirk-sessions.  Witchcraft, Sabbath desecration, and sexual laxities were  the most prominent and popular sins.  The mainstay of the system is the  idea that the Bible is literally inspired; that the preachers are the  perhaps inspired interpreters of the Bible, and that the country must  imitate the old Hebrew persecution of \"idolaters,\" that is, mainly  Catholics.  All this meant a theocracy of preachers elected by the  populace, and governing the nation by their General Assembly in which  nobles and other laymen sat as elders.  These peculiar institutions came  hot from Geneva, and the country could never have been blessed with them,  as we have observed, but for that instrument of Providence, Cardinal  Beaton.  Had he disposed of himself and Scotland to Henry VIII. (who  would not have tolerated Presbyterian claims for an hour), Scotland would  not have received the Genevan discipline, and the Kirk would have groaned  under bishops.    The Reformation supplied Scotland with a class of preachers who were pure  in their lives, who were not accessible to bribes (a virtue in which they  stood almost alone), who were firm in their faith, and soon had learning  enough to defend it; who were constant in their parish work, and of whom  many were credited with prophetic and healing powers.  They could  exorcise ghosts from houses, devils from men possessed.    The baldness of the services, the stern nature of the creed, were  congenial to the people.  The drawbacks were the intolerance, the  spiritual pretensions of the preachers to interference in secular  affairs, and the superstition which credited men like Knox, and later,  Bruce, with the gifts of prophecy and other miraculous workings, and  insisted on the burning of witches and warlocks, whereof the writer knows  scarcely an instance in Scotland before the Reformation.    The pulpit may be said to have discharged the functions of the press (a  press which was all on one side).  When, in 1562, Ninian Winzet, a  Catholic priest and ex-schoolmaster, was printing a controversial  tractate addressed to Knox, the magistrates seized the manuscript at the  printer's house, and the author was fortunate in making his escape.  The  nature of the Confession of Faith, and of the claims of the ministers to  interfere in secular affairs, with divine authority, was certain to cause  war between the Crown and the Kirk.  That war, whether open and armed, or  a conflict in words, endured till, in 1690, the weapon of excommunication  with civil penalties was quietly removed from the ecclesiastical armoury.  Such were the results of a religious revolution hurriedly effected.    The Lords now sent an embassy to Elizabeth about the time of the death of  Amy Robsart, and while Amy's husband, Robert Dudley, was very dear to the  English queen, to urge, vainly, her marriage with Arran.  On December 5,  1560, Francis II. died, leaving Mary Stuart a mere dowager; while her  kinsmen, the Guises, lost power, which fell into the unfriendly hands of  Catherine de Medici.  At once Arran, who made Knox his confidant, began  to woo Mary with a letter and a ring.  Her reply perhaps increased his  tendency to madness, which soon became open and incurable by the science  of the day.    Here we must try to sketch Mary, _la, Reine blanche_, in her white royal  mourning.  Her education had been that of the learned ladies of her age;  she had some knowledge of Latin, and knew French and Italian.  French was  to her almost a mother-tongue, but not quite; she had retained her Scots,  and her attempts to write English are, at first, curiously imperfect.  She  had lived in a profligate Court, but she was not the wanton of hostile  slanders.  She had all the guile of statesmanship, said the English  envoy, Randolph; and she long exercised great patience under daily  insults to her religion and provocations from Elizabeth.  She was  generous, pitiful, naturally honourable, and most loyal to all who served  her.  But her passions, whether of love or hate, once roused, were  tyrannical.  In person she was tall, like her mother, and graceful, with  beautiful hands.  Her face was somewhat long, the nose long and straight,  the lips and chin beautifully moulded, the eyebrows very slender, the  eyes of a reddish brown, long and narrow.  Her hair was russet, drawn  back from a lofty brow; her smile was captivating; she was rather  fascinating than beautiful; her courage and her love of courage in others  were universally confessed. {118}    In January, 1561, the Estates of Scotland ordered James Stuart, Mary's  natural brother, to visit her in France.  In spring she met him, and an  envoy from Huntly (Lesley, later Bishop of Ross), who represented the  Catholic party, and asked Mary to land in Aberdeen, and march south at  the head of the Gordons and certain northern clans.  The proposal came  from noblemen of Perthshire, Angus, and the north, whose forces could not  have faced a Lowland army.  Mary, who had learned from her mother that  Huntly was treacherous, preferred to take her chance with her brother,  who, returning by way of England, moved Elizabeth to recognise the  Scottish queen as her heir.  But Elizabeth would never settle the  succession, and, as Mary refused to ratify the Treaty of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1597"],[0,"Andersen's Fairy Tales (#18)"],[1,"this. He found whole figures which  represented a written word; but he never could manage to represent just  the word he wanted--that word was \"eternity\"; and the Snow Queen had  said, \"If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master,  and I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new  skates.\" But he could not find it out.    \"I am going now to warm lands,\" said the Snow Queen. \"I must have a look  down into the black caldrons.\" It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna  that she meant. \"I will just give them a coating of white, for that is  as it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes.\"  And then away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of  ice that were miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought  and thought till his skull was almost cracked. There he sat quite  benumbed and motionless; one would have imagined he was frozen to death.    Suddenly little Gerda stepped through the great portal into the palace.  The gate was formed of cutting winds; but Gerda repeated her evening  prayer, and the winds were laid as though they slept; and the little  maiden entered the vast, empty, cold halls. There she beheld Kay: she  recognised him, flew to embrace him, and cried out, her arms firmly  holding him the while, \"Kay, sweet little Kay! Have I then found you at  last?\"    But he sat quite still, benumbed and cold. Then little Gerda shed  burning tears; and they fell on his bosom, they penetrated to his  heart, they thawed the lumps of ice, and consumed the splinters of the  looking-glass; he looked at her, and she sang the hymn:    \"The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there  the children to greet.\"    Hereupon Kay burst into tears; he wept so much that the splinter rolled  out of his eye, and he recognised her, and shouted, \"Gerda, sweet little  Gerda! Where have you been so long? And where have I been?\" He looked  round him. \"How cold it is here!\" said he. \"How empty and cold!\" And he  held fast by Gerda, who laughed and wept for joy. It was so beautiful,  that even the blocks of ice danced about for joy; and when they were  tired and laid themselves down, they formed exactly the letters which  the Snow Queen had told him to find out; so now he was his own master,  and he would have the whole world and a pair of new skates into the  bargain.    Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they grew quite blooming; she kissed his  eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and feet, and he  was again well and merry. The Snow Queen might come back as soon as she  liked; there stood his discharge written in resplendent masses of ice.    They took each other by the hand, and wandered forth out of the large  hall; they talked of their old grandmother, and of the roses upon the  roof; and wherever they went, the winds ceased raging, and the sun burst  forth. And when they reached the bush with the red berries, they found  the Reindeer waiting for them. He had brought another, a young one, with  him, whose udder was filled with milk, which he gave to the little ones,  and kissed their lips. They then carried Kay and Gerda--first to the  Finland woman, where they warmed themselves in the warm room, and  learned what they were to do on their journey home; and they went to  the Lapland woman, who made some new clothes for them and repaired their  sledges.    The Reindeer and the young hind leaped along beside them, and  accompanied them to the boundary of the country. Here the first  vegetation peeped forth; here Kay and Gerda took leave of the Lapland  woman. \"Farewell! Farewell!\" they all said. And the first green buds  appeared, the first little birds began to chirrup; and out of the wood  came, riding on a magnificent horse, which Gerda knew (it was one of the  leaders in the golden carriage), a young damsel with a bright-red cap on  her head, and armed with pistols. It was the little robber maiden, who,  tired of being at home, had determined to make a journey to the north;  and afterwards in another direction, if that did not please her. She  recognised Gerda immediately, and Gerda knew her too. It was a joyful  meeting.    \"You are a fine fellow for tramping about,\" said she to little Kay; \"I  should like to know, faith, if you deserve that one should run from one  end of the world to the other for your sake?\"    But Gerda patted her cheeks, and inquired for the Prince and Princess.    \"They are gone abroad,\" said the other.    \"But the Raven?\" asked little Gerda.    \"Oh! The Raven is dead,\" she answered. \"His tame sweetheart is a  widow, and wears a bit of black worsted round her leg; she laments most  piteously, but it's all mere talk and stuff! Now tell me what you've  been doing and how you managed to catch him.\"    And Gerda and Kay both told their story.    And \"Schnipp-schnapp-schnurre-basselurre,\" said the robber maiden; and  she took the hands of each, and promised that if she should some day  pass through the town where they lived, she would come and visit them;  and then away she rode. Kay and Gerda took each other's hand: it was  lovely spring weather, with abundance of flowers and of verdure. The  church-bells rang, and the children recognised the high towers, and the  large town; it was that in which they dwelt. They entered and hastened  up to their grandmother's room, where everything was standing as  formerly. The clock said \"tick! tack!\" and the finger moved round; but  as they entered, they remarked that they were now grown up. The roses  on the leads hung blooming in at the open window; there stood the little  children's chairs, and Kay and Gerda sat down on them, holding each  other by the hand; they both had forgotten the cold empty splendor of  the Snow Queen, as though it had been a dream. The grandmother sat in  the bright sunshine, and read aloud from the Bible: \"Unless ye become as  little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.\"    And Kay and Gerda looked in each other's eyes, and all at once they  understood the old hymn:    \"The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet, And angels descend there  the children to greet.\"    There sat the two grown-up persons; grown-up, and yet children; children  at least in heart; and it was summer-time; summer, glorious summer!          THE LEAP-FROG    A Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could  jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else  besides who chose to come to see the festival. Three famous jumpers were  they, as everyone would say, when they all met together in the room.    \"I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,\" exclaimed the King;  \"for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump for.\"    The Flea was the first to step forward. He had exquisite manners, and  bowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and was,  moreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that makes a great  difference.    Then came the Grasshopper. He was considerably heavier, but he was  well-mannered, and wore a green uniform, which he had by right of birth;  he said, moreover, that he belonged to a very ancient Egyptian family,  and that in the house where he then was, he was thought much of. The  fact was, he had been just brought out of the fields, and put in a  pasteboard house, three stories high, all made of court-cards, with the  colored side inwards; and doors and windows cut out of the body of  the Queen of Hearts. \"I sing so well,\" said he, \"that sixteen native  grasshoppers who have chirped from infancy, and yet got no house built  of cards to live in, grew thinner than they were before for sheer  vexation when they heard me.\"    It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of  themselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a Princess.    The Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion, that  he therefore thought the more; and when the housedog snuffed at him  with his nose, he confessed the Leap-frog was of good family. The old  councillor, who had had three orders given him to make him hold his  tongue, asserted that the Leap-frog was a prophet; for that one could  see on his back, if there would be a severe or mild winter, and that  was what one could not see even on the back of the man who writes the  almanac.    \"I say nothing, it is true,\" exclaimed the King; \"but I have my own  opinion, notwithstanding.\"    Now the trial was to take place. The Flea jumped so high that nobody  could see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not jumped at  all; and that was dishonorable.    The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's  face, who said that was ill-mannered.    The Leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought; it was  believed at last he would not jump at all.    \"I only hope he is not unwell,\" said the house-dog; when, pop! he made a  jump all on one side into the lap of the Princess, who was sitting on a  little golden stool close by.    Hereupon the King said, \"There is nothing above my daughter; therefore  to bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made; but for this,  one must possess understanding, and the Leap-frog has shown that he has  understanding. He is brave and intellectual.\"    And so he won the Princess.    \"It's all the same to me,\" said the Flea. \"She may have the old  Leap-frog, for all I care. I jumped the highest; but in this world  merit seldom meets its reward. A fine exterior is what people look at  now-a-days.\"    The Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was  killed.    The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank, and reflected on worldly  things; and he said too, \"Yes, a fine exterior is everything--a fine  exterior is what people care about.\" And then he began chirping his  peculiar melancholy song, from which we have taken this history; and  which may, very possibly, be all untrue, although it"]]]
