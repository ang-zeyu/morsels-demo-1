But the trembling kept up. For more  than an hour the old man prayed to all the saints in the calendar,  but the earthquake still shook the house.    Then the earthquake stopped a moment, and a voice called him to  come outside. His daughters begged him not to go, for said they,  \"You never can stand such a terrible earthquake.\" Taking his saw,  his axe, and his long bolo, the old man went down, only to find  everything quiet outside. He began to explore the surroundings of  the house to see if he could find the cause of the disturbance, and  fell over the rope. With that he began to curse and swear, saying,  \"May lightning blast the one of ill-omened ancestry who has shaken  my house, frightened my family, and broken my bones,\" and many other  harsh things, but he got no answer but a laugh, and the young man  had his revenge.      CHAPTER 18    The Queen and the Aeta Woman.    There was once a king who was sick unto death. Though he was already  married to a beautiful and charming woman, he promised to marry any  woman who could save his life or recall him after death. Then he died  and after his death the queen was superintending the preparations  for burial and getting ready the collation for the mourners. While  she was busy, an Aeta (Negrito) woman, black, ill-favored, dirty,  and smelling like a goat went into the room. Kneeling by the body,  she began pulling out pins from the flesh, and soon the king awoke,  but his mind was lost. He clasped the Aeta woman to him and showered  on her terms of endearment, thinking that she was the queen, while  all the time the real queen was without.    Seeing how matters stood, the Aeta woman called the queen, \"Maria,  Maria, bring food for the king,\" and she forced the queen to obey  her and work as a slave in the kitchen, while she wore the queen's  robes and lay on the queen's couch. Of course this made a scandal,  but no one could interfere until at last a soldier passed through the  kitchen and seeing the queen's face red with the fire and noting her  beauty, he called the king's attention to her. Then the king remembered  Maria and that she was the real queen, and that the other was only a  hideous Aeta usurper, and he had the Aeta woman tied in a sack with  stones and thrown into the sea.      CHAPTER 19    The Child Saint.    Once there was a child who was different from other children. She  was very quiet and patient, and never spoke unless she was spoken  to. Her mother used to urge her to play in the streets with the other  children, but she always preferred to sit in the corner quietly and  without trouble to any one. When the time came for the child to enter  school, she begged her mother to get her a book of doctrines and let  her learn at home. So her mother got a book of doctrines for her,  and she was able to read at once without being taught. Day after day  she sat in the corner reading her books and meditating.    When she became a little larger she asked to have a little room built  away from the house, where she might remain free from the intrusion  of any earthly thought.    Her mother had this done, and there in the tight little room with no  one to see her she sat. She never tasted the food or drink placed at  her door, and finally her mother, becoming alarmed, made a tiny hole  and peeped through the wall. There sat the child reading her book,  with a huge man standing beside her, and all manner of beasts and  serpents filling the little room.    More frightened than ever, the mother ran to the priest, who told  her that those were devils tempting the child, but not to fear, for  she would certainly become a saint. And it was so, for afterwards the  evil shapes were gone. Then the priest and the people built a costly  shrine and placed her in it, and there the people used to go and ask  her to intercede for them. But at last the shrine was found empty,  and surely she was taken alive into heaven and is now a saint.      CHAPTER 20    Tagalog Babes in the Woods.    Once upon a time there was a cruel father who hated his twin children,  Juan and Maria, and drove them from the house on every occasion.    The children used to live on the grains of rice that fell through  the bamboo floor, and such food as their mother could smuggle to them.    At last, when they were about six years old, their father took them  off into the forest and left them without food or drink. They wandered  for three days, being preserved by such fruits and leaves as they  could gather.    Finally poor Maria said she could go no farther, but that she would  die. Juan cut a mountain bamboo and from its hollow joints gave Maria  a refreshing drink. Then he climbed a tree and in the distance saw  a house. After much exertion they reached it and called out, \"Tauo  po.\" [19] A voice from within said, \"Come in, children.\" They went in  and found a table set, but no one was there, though the same voice  said, \"Eat and drink all you want.\" They did so, and after saying,  \"Thank you, good-by,\" they started to go away, but again they were  bidden to stay. So they stayed on for a long time until Juan was a  young man and Maria a young woman. From a great chest that stood in  the corner they took out new clothing as their old wore out, and the  chest was never empty, and there was always food in the magic dishes  on the table.      CHAPTER 21    The King, the Princess, and the Poor Boy.    There was once a king who loved his daughter very much, so much in  fact that he did not wish her to marry; so he built for her a secret  house or vault under the ground, and there he kept her away from all  but her parents and her maid servants.    There was also an old man in the same city who had a son. The old man  said to his son, \"Come, lad, let us go into the country and plant crops  that we may live,\" for they were very poor. After they had worked a  short time in the country, the old man died and the boy returned to  the king's city and then went up and down the street crying, \"Oh! who  will buy me for a slave, that I may bury my father?\" A kind-hearted  rich man saw him and inquired his troubles, and the boy told him that  he was greatly grieved because his father was dead and he had no money  for the funeral. The rich man told him not to grieve, that his father  would be buried with all the ceremonies given to any one. After the  funeral the boy went to live with the rich man as his servant, and  served him faithfully; so faithfully, indeed, that the rich man, who  was childless, adopted him and gave him every advantage of education.    One day the boy wrote a sentence and placed it in the window, \"You may  hide your treasure with every care, and watch it well, but it will be  spent at last.\" Now the boy had no idea of any hidden meaning in this  sentence, but the king chanced to pass that way and read it. Angrily  he called the rich man to his carriage, and demanded of him what  it meant. \"I do not know, most exalted king,\" said the rich man,  \"I have only now seen it. It must have been written by a poor boy to  whom I have given shelter since his father died.\" \"Drive him away,\"  said the king; \"if he comes back he shall be put to death.\"    So the rich man with a heavy heart, for he loved the boy, sent him  out into the world. The boy wandered far and long, till at last he  came to a house. He called out to those within, \"Honorable people,\"  and heard them answer, \"Come in.\" Inside there was no one but only  two statues, and one of these spoke, bidding him return to his own  town and beg of his master princely clothing, a princely carriage,  all gilt, and a music box that could play many tunes.    So the poor boy returned to his master, who sent for the tradesmen  and tailors and had them make all manner of princely clothing.    Then he got into his carriage and drove around for a while, till  he met a boy. To the boy he gave the music box and a piece of money  and told him to play it everywhere but to sell it to nobody, and to  report to him if any one wanted it. So the boy got into the carriage  and took the music box with him, while the poor boy went back to the  rich man's house.    Soon the king saw the beautiful carriage and heard the sweet music of  the music box. The king asked the boy who the owner was, and wished  to buy them. The boy told the king that he must tell his employer,  and soon the carriage and the music box were sent to the king for  a present.    The king was much pleased, for he knew the princess would be delighted,  so he had the carriage and the music box taken into her vault, and  played on the music box a long time. After he had gone, out stepped  the poor boy from a secret compartment of the carriage, and knelt  before her telling his love in gentle tones. She listened to him,  much frightened at first, but later more composedly, till at last  she gave him her heart and promised him her hand.    When the king came in again he found them sitting holding each other's  hands. He demanded in a loud voice, \"Who are you? Why are you here? How  did you come?\" To this the boy modestly replied, saying that he had  come concealed in the carriage, and told the king that \"You may hide  your treasure with every care, and watch it well, but it will be spent  at last.\" But the princess entreated for him, and finally the king  gave his consent to their marriage, and they lived happily ever after.      CHAPTER 22    Hidden Treasure.    There were once a husband and his wife who were very poor. They had  a little plot of ground that helped to sustain them, but as the man  was sick the woman went to work alone.    As she was weeding in the fields she found a malapad, [20] and after  a little she found another, and so on until she had a sec-apat. [21]  With this she returned home and bought rice, but she was afraid to  tell her husband lest he be jealous.  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#18)"],[1," on the solid rock were pointed out.    At the fountain of Cozcapan, sorcerers met him, minded to prevent his  departure:--    \"Where are you going?\" they asked. \"Why have you left your capital? In  whose care is it? Who will perform the sacred rites?\"    But Quetzalcoatl answered:--    \"You can in no manner hinder my departure. I have no choice but to go.\"    The sorcerers asked again: \"Whither are you going?\"    \"I am going,\" replied Quetzalcoatl, \"to Tlapallan. I have been sent for.  The Sun calls me.\"    \"Go, then, with good luck,\" said they. \"But leave with us the art of  smelting silver, of working stone and wood, of painting, of weaving  feathers and other such arts.\"    Thus they robbed him, and taking the rich jewels he carried with him he  cast them into the fountain, whence it received its name _Cozcapan_,  Jewels in the Water.    Again, as he journeyed, a sorcerer met him, who asked him his  destination:--    \"I go,\" said Quetzalcoatl, \"to Tlallapan.\"    \"And luck go with you,\" replied the sorcerer, \"but first take a drink of  this wine.\"    \"No,\" replied Quetzalcoatl, \"not so much as a sip.\"    \"You must taste a little of it,\" said the sorcerer, \"even if it is by  force. To no living person would I give to drink freely of it. I  intoxicate them all. Come and drink of it.\"    Quetzalcoatl took the wine and drank of it through a reed, and as he drank  he grew drunken and fell in the road, where he slept and snored.    Thus he passed from place to place, with various adventures. His servants  were all dwarfs or hunchbacks, and in crossing the Sierra Nevada they  mostly froze to death. By drawing a line across the Sierra he split it in  two and thus made a passage. He plucked up a mighty tree and hurling it  through another, thus formed a cross. At another spot he caused  underground houses to be built, which were called Mictlancalco, At the  House of Darkness.    At length he arrived at the sea coast where he constructed a raft of  serpents, and seating himself on it as in a canoe, he moved out to sea. No  one knows how or in what manner he reached Tlapallan.[1]    [Footnote 1: These myths are from the third book of Sahagun's _Historia de  las Cosas de Nueva Espana_. They were taken down in the original Nahuatl,  by him, from the mouth of the natives, and he gives them word for word, as  they were recounted.]    The legend which appears to have been prevalent in Cholula was somewhat  different. According to that, Quetzalcoatl was for many years Lord of  Tollan, ruling over a happy people. At length, Tezcatlipoca let himself  down from heaven by a cord made of spider's web, and, coming to Tollan,  challenged its ruler to play a game of ball. The challenge was accepted,  and the people of the city gathered in thousands to witness the sport.  Suddenly Tezcatlipoca changed himself into a tiger, which so frightened  the populace that they fled in such confusion and panic that they rushed  over the precipice and into the river, where nearly all were killed by the  fall or drowned in the waters.    Quetzalcoatl then forsook Tollan, and journeyed from city to city till he  reached Cholula, where he lived twenty years. He was at that time of light  complexion, noble stature, his eyes large, his hair abundant, his beard  ample and cut rounding. In life he was most chaste and honest. They  worshiped his memory, especially for three things: first, because he  taught them the art of working in metals, which previous to his coming was  unknown in that land; secondly, because he forbade the sacrifice either of  human beings or the lower animals, teaching that bread, and roses, and  flowers, incense and perfumes, were all that the gods demanded; and  lastly, because he forbade, and did his best to put a stop to, wars,  fighting, robbery, and all deeds of violence. For these reasons he was  held in high esteem and affectionate veneration, not only by those of  Cholula, but by the neighboring tribes as well, for many leagues around.  Distant nations maintained temples in his honor in that city, and made  pilgrimages to it, on which journeys they passed in safety through their  enemy's countries.    The twenty years past, Quetzalcoatl resumed his journey, taking with him  four of the principal youths of the city. When he had reached a point in  the province of Guazacoalco, which is situated to the southeast of  Cholula, he called the four youths to him, and told them they should  return to their city; that he had to go further; but that they should go  back and say that at some future day white and bearded men like himself  would come from the east, who would possess the land.[1]    [Footnote 1: For this version of the myth, see Mendieta, _Historia  Eclesiastica Indiana_, Lib. ii, caps, v and x.]    Thus he disappeared, no one knew whither. But another legend said that he  died there, by the seashore, and they burned his body. Of this event some  particulars are given by Ixtlilxochitl, as follows:[1]--    [Footnote 1: Ixtlilxochitl, _Relaciones Historicas_, p. 388, in  Kingsborough, vol. ix.]    Quetzalcoatl, surnamed Topiltzin, was lord of Tula. At a certain time he  warned his subjects that he was obliged to go \"to the place whence comes  the Sun,\" but that after a term he would return to them, in that year of  their calendar of the name _Ce Acatl_, One Reed, which returns every  fifty-two years. He went forth with many followers, some of whom he left  in each city he visited. At length he reached the town of Ma Tlapallan.  Here he announced that he should soon die, and directed his followers to  burn his body and all his treasures with him. They obeyed his orders, and  for four days burned his corpse, after which they gathered its ashes and  placed them in a sack made of the skin of a tiger.    The introduction of the game of ball and the tiger into the story is not  so childish as it seems. The game of ball was as important an amusement  among the natives of Mexico and Central America as were the jousts and  tournaments in Europe in the Middle Ages.[1] Towns, nations and kings were  often pitted against each other. In the great temple of Mexico two courts  were assigned to this game, over which a special deity was supposed to  preside.[2] In or near the market place of each town there were walls  erected for the sport. In the centre of these walls was an orifice a  little larger than the ball. The players were divided into two parties,  and the ball having been thrown, each party tried to drive it through or  over the wall. The hand was not used, but only the hip or shoulders.    [Footnote 1: Torquemada gives a long but obscure description of it.  _Monarquia Indiana_, Lib. xiv, cap. xii.]    [Footnote 2: Nieremberg, \"De septuaginta et octo partibus maximi templi  Mexicani,\" in his _Historia Naturae_, Lib. viii, cap. xxii (Antwerpt,  1635). One of these was called \"The Ball Court of the Mirror,\" perhaps  with special reference to this legend. \"Trigesima secunda Tezcatlacho,  locus erat ubi ludebatur pila ex gumi olli, inter templa.\" The name is  from _tezcatl_, mirror, _tlachtli_, the game of ball, and locative ending  _co_.]    From the earth the game was transferred to the heavens. As a ball, hit by  a player, strikes the wall and then bounds back again, describing a curve,  so the stars in the northern sky circle around the pole star and return to  the place they left. Hence their movement was called The Ball-play of the  Stars.[1]    [Footnote 1: \"_Citlaltlachtli_,\" from _citlalin_, star, and _tlachtli_,  the game of ball. Alvarado Tezozomoc, _Cronica Mexicana_, cap. lxxxii. The  obscure passage in which Tezozomoc refers to this is ingeniously analyzed  in the _Anales del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, p. 388.]    A recent writer asserts that the popular belief of the Aztecs extended the  figure to a greater game than this.[1] The Sun and Moon were huge balls  with which the gods played an unceasing game, now one, now the other,  having the better of it. If this is so, then the game between Tezcatlipoca  and Quetzalcoatl is again a transparent figure of speech for the contest  between night and day.    [Footnote 1: _Anales del Museo Nacional_, Tom. ii, p. 367.]    The Mexican tiger, the _ocelotl_, was a well recognized figure of speech,  in the Aztec tongue, for the nocturnal heavens, dotted with stars, as is  the tiger skin with spots.[1] The tiger, therefore, which destroyed the  subjects of Quetzalcoatl--the swift-footed, happy inhabitants of Tula--was  none other than the night extinguishing the rays of the orb of light. In  the picture writings Tezcatlipoca appears dressed in a tiger's skin, the  spots on which represent the stars, and thus symbolize him in his  character as the god of the sky at night.    [Footnote 1: \"Segun los Anales de Cuauhtitlan el _ocelotl_ es el cielo  manchado de estrellas, como piel de tigre.\" _Anales del Mus. Nac._, ii, p.  254.]    The apotheosis of Quetzalcoatl from the embers of his funeral pyre to the  planet Venus has led several distinguished students of Mexican mythology  to identify his whole history with the astronomical relations of this  bright star. Such an interpretation is, however, not only contrary to  results obtained by the general science of mythology, but it is  specifically in contradiction to the uniform statements of the old  writers. All these agree that it was not till _after_ he had finished his  career, _after_ he had run his course and disappeared from the sight and  knowledge of men, that he was translated and became the evening or morning  star.[1] This clearly signifies that he was represented by the planet in  only one, and that a subordinate, phase of his activity. We can readily  see that the relation of Venus to the sun, and the evening and morning  twilights, suggested the pleasing tale that as the light dies in the west,  it is, in a certain way, preserved by the star which hangs so bright above  the horizon.
