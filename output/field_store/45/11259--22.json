Oh, the manifold miseries! who shall be able to tell them?  E'en before crossing the meadows, and while we were yet at a distance,  Saw we the dust; but still from hill to hill the procession  Passed away out of our sight, and we could distinguish but little.  But when at last we were come to the street that crosses the valley,  Great was the crowd and confusion of persons on foot and of wagons.  There, alas! saw we enough of these poor unfortunates passing,  And could from some of them learn how bitter the sorrowful flight was,  Yet how joyful the feeling of life thus hastily rescued.  Mournful it was to behold the most miscellaneous chattels,--  All those things which are housed in every well-furnished dwelling,  All by the house-keeper's care set up in their suitable places,  Always ready for use; for useful is each and important.--  Now these things to behold, piled up on all manner of wagons,  One on the top of another, as hurriedly they had been rescued.  Over the chest of drawers were the sieve and wool coverlet lying;  Thrown in the kneading-trough lay the bed, and the sheets on the mirror.  Danger, alas! as we learned ourselves in our great conflagration  Twenty years since, will take from a man all power of reflection,  So that he grasps things worthless and leaves what is precious behind him.  Here, too, with unconsidering care they were carrying with them  Pitiful trash, that only encumbered the horses and oxen;  Such as old barrels and boards, the pen for the goose, and the bird-cage.  Women and children, too, went toiling along with their bundles,  Panting 'neath baskets and tubs, full of things of no manner of value:  So unwilling is man to relinquish his meanest possession.  Thus on the dusty road the crowded procession moved forward,  All confused and disordered. The one whose beasts were the weaker,  Wanted more slowly to drive, while faster would hurry another.  Presently went up a scream from the closely squeezed women and children,  And with the yelping of dogs was mingled the lowing of cattle,  Cries of distress from the aged and sick, who aloft on the wagon,  Heavy and thus overpacked, upon beds were sitting and swaying.  Pressed at last from the rut and out to the edge of the highway,  Slipped the creaking wheel; the cart lost its balance, and over  Fell in the ditch. In the swing the people were flung to a distance,  Far off into the field, with horrible screams; by good fortune  Later the boxes were thrown and fell more near to the wagon.  Verily all who had witnessed the fall, expected to see them  Crushed into pieces beneath the weight of trunks and of presses.  So lay the cart all broken to fragments, and helpless the people.  Keeping their onward way, the others drove hastily by them,  Each thinking only of self, and carried away by the current.  Then we ran to the spot, and found the sick and the aged,--  Those who at home and in bed could before their lingering ailments  Scarcely endure,--lying bruised on the ground, complaining and groaning,  Choked by the billowing dust and scorched by the heat of the noonday.\"    Thereupon answered and said the kind-hearted landlord, with feeling:  \"Would that our Hermann might meet them and give them refreshment                                                     and clothing!  Loath should I be to behold them: the looking on suffering pains me.  Touched by the earliest tidings of their so cruel afflictions,  Hastily sent we a mite from out of our super-abundance,  Only that some might be strengthened, and we might ourselves be made easy.  But let us now no longer renew these sorrowful pictures  Knowing how readily fear steals into the heart of us mortals,  And anxiety, worse to me than the actual evil.  Come with me into the room behind, our cool little parlor,  Where no sunbeam e'er shines, and no sultry breath ever enters  Through its thickness of wall. There mother will bring us a flagon  Of our old eighty-three, with which we may banish our fancies.  Here 'tis not cosey to drink: the flies so buzz round the glasses.\"  Thither adjourned they then, and all rejoiced in the coolness.    Carefully brought forth the mother the clear and glorious vintage,  Cased in a well-polished flask, on a waiter of glittering pewter,  Set round with large green glasses, the drinking cups meet for the                                                       Rhine wine.  So sat the three together about the highly waxed table,  Gleaming and round and brown, that on mighty feet was supported.  Joyously rang at once the glasses of landlord and pastor,  But his motionless held the third, and sat lost in reflection,  Until with words of good-humor the landlord challenged him, saying,--  \"Come, sir neighbor, empty your glass, for God in His mercy  Thus far has kept us from evil, and so in the future will keep us.  For who acknowledges not, that since our dread conflagration,  When He so hardly chastised us, He now is continually blessing,  Constantly shielding, as man the apple of His eye watches over,  Holding it precious and dear above all the rest of His members?  Shall He in time to come not defend us and furnish us succor?  Only when danger is nigh do we see how great is His power.  Shall He this blooming town which He once by industrious burghers  Built up afresh from its ashes, and afterward blessed with abundance,  Now demolish again, and bring all the labor to nothing?\"    Cheerfully said in reply the excellent pastor, and kindly:  \"Keep thyself firm in the faith, and firm abide in this temper;  For it makes steadfast and wise when fortune is fair, and when evil,  Furnishes sweet consolation and animates hopes the sublimest.\"    Then made answer the landlord, with thoughts judicious and manly:  \"Often the Rhine's broad stream have I with astonishment greeted,  As I have neared it again, after travelling abroad upon business.  Always majestic it seemed, and my mind and spirit exalted.  But I could never imagine its beautiful banks would so shortly  Be to a rampart transformed, to keep from our borders the Frenchman,  And its wide-spreading bed be a moat all passage to hinder.  See! thus nature protects, the stout-hearted Germans protect us,  And thus protects us the Lord, who then will be weakly despondent?  Weary already the combatants, all indications are peaceful.  Would it might be that when that festival, ardently longed for,  Shall in our church be observed, when the sacred _Te Deum_ is rising,  Swelled by the pealing of organ and bells, and the blaring of trumpets,--  Would it might be that that day should behold my Hermann, sir pastor,  Standing, his choice now made, with his bride before thee at the altar,  Making that festal day, that through every land shall be honored,  My anniversary, too, henceforth of domestic rejoicing!  But I observe with regret, that the youth so efficient and active  Ever in household affairs, when abroad is timid and backward.  Little enjoyment he finds in going about among others;  Nay, he will even avoid young ladies' society wholly;  Shuns the enlivening dance which all young persons delight in.\"    Thus he spoke and listened; for now was heard in the distance  Clattering of horses' hoofs drawing near, and the roll of the wagon,  Which, with furious haste, came thundering under the gateway.      TERPSICHORE    HERMANN    Now when of comely mien the son came into the chamber,  Turned with a searching look the eyes of the preacher upon him,  And, with the gaze of the student, who easily fathoms expression,  Scrutinized well his face and form and his general bearing.  Then with a smile he spoke, and said in words of affection:  \"Truly a different being thou comest! I never have seen thee  Cheerful as now, nor ever beheld I thy glances so beaming.  Joyous thou comest, and happy: 'tis plain that among the poor people  Thou hast been sharing thy gifts, and receiving their blessings                                                    upon thee.\"    Quietly then, and with serious words, the son made him answer:  \"If I have acted as ye will commend, I know not; but I followed  That which my heart bade me do, as I shall exactly relate you.  Thou wert, mother, so long in rummaging 'mong thy old pieces,  Picking and choosing, that not until late was thy bundle together;  Then, too, the wine and the beer took care and time in the packing.  When I came forth through the gateway at last, and out on the high-road,  Backward the crowd of citizens streamed with women and children,  Coming to meet me; for far was already the band of the exiles.  Quicker I kept on my way, and drove with speed to the village,  Where they were meaning to rest, as I heard, and tarry till morning.  Thitherward up the new street as I hasted, a stout-timbered wagon,  Drawn by two oxen, I saw, of that region the largest and strongest;  While, with vigorous steps, a maiden was walking beside them,  And, a long staff in her hand, the two powerful creatures was guiding,  Urging them now, now holding them back; with skill did she drive them.    [Illustration: HERMANN HANDS TO DOROTHEA THE LINEN FOR THE EMIGRANTS  Ludwig Richter]    Soon as the maiden perceived me, she calmly drew near to the horses,  And in these words she addressed me: 'Not thus deplorable always  Has our condition been, as to-day on this journey thou seest.  I am not yet grown used to asking gifts of a stranger,  Which he will often unwillingly give, to be rid of the beggar.  But necessity drives me to speak; for here, on the straw, lies  Newly delivered of child, a rich land-owner's wife, whom I scarcely  Have in her pregnancy, safe brought off"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11128"],[0,"The Red Thumb Mark (#18)"],[1,"to settle in his own mind the vexed question of her  relations with and sentiments towards our unfortunate client; but what  conclusions he arrived at I was unable to discover, for he was by no  means communicative after she had left. Nor was there any repetition of  the visit--greatly to my regret--since, as I have said, he was able, in  a day or two, to resume his ordinary mode of life.    The first evidence I had of his renewed activity appeared when I  returned to the chambers at about eleven o'clock in the morning, to find  Polton hovering dejectedly about the sitting-room, apparently  perpetrating as near an approach to a \"spring clean\" as could be  permitted in a bachelor establishment.    \"Hallo, Polton!\" I exclaimed, \"have you contrived to tear yourself away  from the laboratory for an hour or two?\"    \"No, sir,\" he answered gloomily. \"The laboratory has torn itself away  from me.\"    \"What do you mean?\" I asked.    \"The Doctor has shut himself in and locked the door, and he says I am  not to disturb him. It will be a cold lunch to-day.\"    \"What is he doing in there?\" I inquired.    \"Ah!\" said Polton, \"that's just what I should like to know. I'm fair  eaten up with curiosity. He is making some experiments in connection  with some of his cases, and when the Doctor locks himself in to make  experiments, something interesting generally follows. I should like to  know what it is this time.\"    \"I suppose there is a keyhole in the laboratory door?\" I suggested, with  a grin.    \"Sir!\" he exclaimed indignantly. \"Dr. Jervis, I am surprised at you.\"  Then, perceiving my facetious intent, he smiled also and added: \"But  there _is_ a keyhole if you'd like to try it, though I'll wager the  Doctor would see more of you than you would of him.\"    \"You are mighty secret about your doings, you and the Doctor,\" I said.    \"Yes,\" he answered. \"You see, it's a queer trade this of the Doctor's,  and there are some queer secrets in it. Now, for instance, what do you  make of this?\"    He produced from his pocket a leather case, whence he took a piece of  paper which he handed to me. On it was a neatly executed drawing of what  looked like one of a set of chessmen, with the dimensions written on the  margin.    \"It looks like a pawn--one of the Staunton pattern,\" I said.    \"Just what I thought; but it isn't. I've got to make twenty-four of  them, and what the Doctor is going to do with them fairly beats me.\"    \"Perhaps he has invented some new game,\" I suggested facetiously.  \"He  is always inventing new games and playing them mostly in courts of law,  and then the other players generally lose. But this is a puzzler, and no  mistake. Twenty-four of these to be turned up in the best-seasoned  boxwood! What can they be for? Something to do with the experiments he  is carrying on upstairs at this very moment, I expect.\" He shook his  head, and, having carefully returned the drawing to his pocket-book,  said, in a solemn tone--\"Sir, there are times when the Doctor makes me  fairly dance with curiosity. And this is one of them.\"    Although not afflicted with a curiosity so acute as that of Polton, I  found myself speculating at intervals on the nature of my colleague's  experiments and the purpose of the singular little objects which he had  ordered to be made; but I was unacquainted with any of the cases on  which he was engaged, excepting that of Reuben Hornby, and with the  latter I was quite unable to connect a set of twenty-four boxwood  chessmen. Moreover, on this day, I was to accompany Juliet on her second  visit to Holloway, and that circumstance gave me abundant mental  occupation of another kind.    At lunch, Thorndyke was animated and talkative but not communicative. He  \"had some work in the laboratory that he must do himself,\" he said, but  gave no hint as to its nature; and as soon as our meal was finished, he  returned to his labours, leaving me to pace up and down the walk,  listening with ridiculous eagerness for the sound of the hansom that was  to transport me to the regions of the blest, and--incidentally--to  Holloway Prison.    When I returned to the Temple, the sitting-room was empty and hideously  neat, as the result of Polton's spring-cleaning efforts. My colleague  was evidently still at work in the laboratory, and, from the  circumstance that the tea-things were set out on the table and a kettle  of water placed in readiness on the gas-ring by the fireplace, I  gathered that Polton also was full of business and anxious not to be  disturbed.    Accordingly, I lit the gas and made my tea, enlivening my solitude by  turning over in my mind the events of the afternoon.    Juliet had been charming--as she always was--frank, friendly and  unaffectedly pleased to have my companionship. She evidently liked me  and did not disguise the fact--why should she indeed?--but treated me  with a freedom, almost affectionate, as though I had been a favourite  brother; which was very delightful, and would have been more so if I  could have accepted the relationship. As to her feelings towards me, I  had not the slightest misgiving, and so my conscience was clear; for  Juliet was as innocent as a child, with the innocence that belongs to  the direct, straightforward nature that neither does evil itself nor  looks for evil motives in others. For myself, I was past praying for.  The thing was done and I must pay the price hereafter, content to  reflect that I had trespassed against no one but myself. It was a  miserable affair, and many a heartache did it promise me in the lonely  days that were to come, when I should have said \"good-bye\" to the Temple  and gone back to my old nomadic life; and yet I would not have had it  changed if I could; would not have bartered the bitter-sweet memories  for dull forgetfulness.    But other matters had transpired in the course of our drive than those  that loomed so large to me in the egotism of my love. We had spoken of  Mr. Hornby and his affairs, and from our talk there had emerged certain  facts of no little moment to the inquiry on which I was engaged.    \"Misfortunes are proverbially sociable,\" Juliet had remarked, in  reference to her adopted uncle. \"As if this trouble about Reuben were  not enough, there are worries in the city. Perhaps you have heard of  them.\"    I replied that Walter had mentioned the matter to me.    \"Yes,\" said Juliet rather viciously; \"I am not quite clear as to what  part that good gentleman has played in the matter. It has come out,  quite accidentally, that he had a large holding in the mines himself,  but he seems to have 'cut his loss,' as the phrase goes, and got out of  them; though how he managed to pay such large differences is more than  we can understand. We think he must have raised money somehow to do it.\"    \"Do you know when the mines began to depreciate?\" I asked.    \"Yes, it was quite a sudden affair--what Walter calls 'a slump'--and it  occurred only a few days before the robbery. Mr. Hornby was telling me  about it only yesterday, and he recalled it to me by a ridiculous  accident that happened on that day.\"    \"What was that?\" I inquired.    \"Why, I cut my finger and nearly fainted,\" she answered, with a  shamefaced little laugh. \"It was rather a bad cut, you know, but I  didn't notice it until I found my hand covered with blood. Then I turned  suddenly faint, and had to lie down on the hearthrug--it was in Mr.  Hornby's study, which I was tidying up at the time. Here I was found by  Reuben, and a dreadful fright it gave him at first; and then he tore up  his handkerchief to tie up the wounded finger, and you never saw such an  awful mess as he got his hands in. He might have been arrested as a  murderer, poor boy, from the condition he was in. It will make your  professional gorge rise to learn that he fastened up the extemporised  bandage with red tape, which he got from the writing table after rooting  about among the sacred papers in the most ruthless fashion.    \"When he had gone I tried to put the things on the table straight again,  and really you might have thought some horrible crime had been  committed; the envelopes and papers were all smeared with blood and  marked with the print of gory fingers. I remembered it afterwards, when  Reuben's thumb-mark was identified, and thought that perhaps one of the  papers might have got into the safe by accident; but Mr. Hornby told me  that was impossible; he tore the leaf off his memorandum block at the  time when he put away the diamonds.\"    Such was the gist of our conversation as the cab rattled through the  streets on the way to the prison; and certainly it contained matter  sufficiently important to draw away my thoughts from other subjects,  more agreeable, but less relevant to the case. With a sudden remembrance  of my duty, I drew forth my notebook, and was in the act of committing  the statements to writing, when Thorndyke entered the room.    \"Don't let me interrupt you, Jervis,\" said he. \"I will make myself a cup  of tea while you finish your writing, and then you shall exhibit the  day's catch and hang your nets out to dry.\"    I was not long in finishing my notes, for I was in a fever of impatience  to hear Thorndyke's comments on my latest addition to our store of  information. By the time the kettle was boiling my entries were  completed, and I proceeded forthwith to retail to my colleague those  extracts from my conversation with Juliet that I have just recorded.    He listened, as usual, with deep and critical attention.    \"This is very interesting and important,\" he said, when I had finished;  \"really, Jervis, you are a most invaluable coadjutor. It seems that  information, which would be strictly withheld from the forbidding  Jorkins, trickles freely and unasked into the ear of the genial Spenlow.  Now, I suppose you regard your hypothesis as having received very  substantial confirmation?\"    \"Certainly, I do.\"    \"And very justifiably. You see"]]]
