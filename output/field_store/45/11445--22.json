Mr. King, my new  master, then made a reply, and said the reason he had bought me was on  account of my good character; and, as he had not the least doubt of my  good behaviour, I should be very well off with him. He also told me he  did not live in the West Indies, but at Philadelphia, where he was  going soon; and, as I understood something of the rules of  arithmetic, when we got there he would put me to school, and fit me  for a clerk. This conversation relieved my mind a little, and I left  those gentlemen considerably more at ease in myself than when I came  to them; and I was very grateful to Captain Doran, and even to my old  master, for the character they had given me; a character which I  afterwards found of infinite service to me. I went on board again, and  took leave of all my shipmates; and the next day the ship sailed. When  she weighed anchor I went to the waterside and looked at her with a  very wishful and aching heart, and followed her with my eyes and tears  until she was totally out of sight. I was so bowed down with grief  that I could not hold up my head for many months; and if my new master  had not been kind to me I believe I should have died under it at last.  And indeed I soon found that he fully deserved the good character  which Captain Doran had given me of him; for he possessed a most  amiable disposition and temper, and was very charitable and humane. If  any of his slaves behaved amiss he did not beat or use them ill, but  parted with them. This made them afraid of disobliging him; and as he  treated his slaves better than any other man on the island, so he was  better and more faithfully served by them in return. By his kind  treatment I did at last endeavour to compose myself; and with  fortitude, though moneyless, determined to face whatever fate had  decreed for me. Mr. King soon asked me what I could do; and at the  same time said he did not mean to treat me as a common slave. I told  him I knew something of seamanship, and could shave and dress hair  pretty well; and I could refine wines, which I had learned on  shipboard, where I had often done it; and that I could write, and  understood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the Rule of Three. He  then asked me if I knew any thing of gauging; and, on my answering  that I did not, he said one of his clerks should teach me to gauge.    Mr. King dealt in all manner of merchandize, and kept from one to six  clerks. He loaded many vessels in a year; particularly to  Philadelphia, where he was born, and was connected with a great  mercantile house in that city. He had besides many vessels and  droggers, of different sizes, which used to go about the island; and  others to collect rum, sugar, and other goods. I understood pulling  and managing those boats very well; and this hard work, which was the  first that he set me to, in the sugar seasons used to be my constant  employment. I have rowed the boat, and slaved at the oars, from one  hour to sixteen in the twenty-four; during which I had fifteen pence  sterling per day to live on, though sometimes only ten pence. However  this was considerably more than was allowed to other slaves that used  to work with me, and belonged to other gentlemen on the island: those  poor souls had never more than nine pence per day, and seldom more  than six pence, from their masters or owners, though they earned them  three or four pisterines[Q]: for it is a common practice in the West  Indies for men to purchase slaves though they have not plantations  themselves, in order to let them out to planters and merchants at so  much a piece by the day, and they give what allowance they chuse out  of this produce of their daily work to their slaves for subsistence;  this allowance is often very scanty. My master often gave the owners  of these slaves two and a half of these pieces per day, and found the  poor fellows in victuals himself, because he thought their owners did  not feed them well enough according to the work they did. The slaves  used to like this very well; and, as they knew my master to be a man  of feeling, they were always glad to work for him in preference to any  other gentleman; some of whom, after they had been paid for these poor  people's labours, would not give them their allowance out of it. Many  times have I even seen these unfortunate wretches beaten for asking  for their pay; and often severely flogged by their owners if they did  not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time; though  the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had  worked for sometimes for more than half the day before they could get  their pay; and this generally on Sundays, when they wanted the time  for themselves. In particular, I knew a countryman of mine who once  did not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and though  he brought it the same day to his master, yet he was staked to the  ground for this pretended negligence, and was just going to receive a  hundred lashes, but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty. This  poor man was very industrious; and, by his frugality, had saved so  much money by working on shipboard, that he had got a white man to buy  him a boat, unknown to his master. Some time after he had this little  estate the governor wanted a boat to bring his sugar from different  parts of the island; and, knowing this to be a negro-man's boat, he  seized upon it for himself, and would not pay the owner a farthing.  The man on this went to his master, and complained to him of this act  of the governor; but the only satisfaction he received was to be  damned very heartily by his master, who asked him how dared any of his  negroes to have a boat. If the justly-merited ruin of the governor's  fortune could be any gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed,  he was not without consolation. Extortion and rapine are poor  providers; and some time after this the governor died in the King's  Bench in England, as I was told, in great poverty. The last war  favoured this poor negro-man, and he found some means to escape from  his Christian master: he came to England; where I saw him afterwards  several times. Such treatment as this often drives these miserable  wretches to despair, and they run away from their masters at the  hazard of their lives. Many of them, in this place, unable to get  their pay when they have earned it, and fearing to be flogged, as  usual, if they return home without it, run away where they can for  shelter, and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive.  My master used sometimes, in these cases, to agree with their owners,  and to settle with them himself; and thereby he saved many of them a  flogging.    Once, for a few days, I was let out to fit a vessel, and I had no  victuals allowed me by either party; at last I told my master of this  treatment, and he took me away from it. In many of the estates, on the  different islands where I used to be sent for rum or sugar, they would  not deliver it to me, or any other negro; he was therefore obliged to  send a white man along with me to those places; and then he used to  pay him from six to ten pisterines a day. From being thus employed,  during the time I served Mr. King, in going about the different  estates on the island, I had all the opportunity I could wish for to  see the dreadful usage of the poor men; usage that reconciled me to my  situation, and made me bless God for the hands into which I had  fallen.    I had the good fortune to please my master in every department in  which he employed me; and there was scarcely any part of his business,  or household affairs, in which I was not occasionally engaged. I often  supplied the place of a clerk, in receiving and delivering cargoes to  the ships, in tending stores, and delivering goods: and, besides this,  I used to shave and dress my master when convenient, and take care of  his horse; and when it was necessary, which was very often, I worked  likewise on board of different vessels of his. By these means I became  very useful to my master; and saved him, as he used to acknowledge,  above a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he scruple to say I was of more  advantage to him than any of his clerks; though their usual wages in  the West Indies are from sixty to a hundred pounds current a year.    I have sometimes heard it asserted that a negro cannot earn his master  the first cost; but nothing can be further from the truth. I suppose  nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the West Indies are negro  slaves; and I well know the coopers among them earn two dollars a day;  the carpenters the same, and oftentimes more; as also the masons,  smiths, and fishermen, &c. and I have known many slaves whose masters  would not take a thousand pounds current for them. But surely this  assertion refutes itself; for, if it be true, why do the planters and  merchants pay such a price for slaves? And, above all, why do those  who make this assertion exclaim the most loudly against the abolition  of the slave trade? So much are men blinded, and to such inconsistent  arguments are they driven by mistaken interest! I grant, indeed, that  slaves are some times, by half-feeding, half-clothing, over-working  and stripes, reduced so low, that they are turned out as unfit for  service, and left to perish in the woods, or expire on a dunghill.    My master was several times offered by different gentlemen one hundred  guineas for me; but he always told them he would not sell me, to my  great joy: and I used to double my diligence and care for fear of  getting into the hands of those men who did not allow a valuable slave  the common support of life. Many of them even used to find fault with  my "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15446"],[0,"Vocal Mastery (#18)"],[1," professional; he was a business man who at the same  time was a good musician. Instead of starting me with a lot of scales  and exercises, we began at once with the operas. I was twelve years old  when I began, and after one year of this kind of study, made my debut in  the role of Inez, in _L'Africaine_. About this time I lost my kind  instructor, who passed away. I then worked by myself until I was  sixteen, when I began to study technic systematically. As you see, then,  I am practically self-taught. It seems to me, if one has voice and  intelligence, one can and should be one's own teacher. No one else can  do as much for you as you can do for yourself. You can tell what the  sensations are, what parts are relaxed and what parts are firm, better  than any one else. You can listen and work on tone quality until it  reaches the effect you desire. I do not neglect vocal technic now, for I  know its value. I do about three quarters of an hour technical practice  every day--scales and exercises.      MEMORIZING    \"I memorize very easily; it only takes a few weeks to learn an operatic  role. I spent three weeks on _Coq d'Or_, and that is a difficult part,  so many half tones and accidentals. But I love that music, it is so  beautiful; it is one of my favorite roles. Some parts are longer and  more difficult than others. Of course I know most of the Italian operas  and many French ones. I should like to sing _Mireille_ and _Lakme_ here,  but the Director may wish to put on other works instead.      SPANISH OPERA    \"Yes, we have native opera in Spain, but the works of our operatic  composers are little known in other lands. The Spanish people are  clannish, you see, and seem to lack the ambition to travel abroad to  make their art known to others; they are satisfied to make it known to  their own people. Casals and I--we are perhaps the ones who regularly  visit you, though you have several Spanish singers in the opera who  reside here permanently.    \"As for Spanish composers of instrumental music, you are here somewhat  familiar with the names of Grovelez and Albeniz; Granados you know also,  both his opera, _Goyescas_, which was performed at the Metropolitan, and  his personality. He came to America to witness the premier of his opera,  and while here proved he was a most excellent pianist as well as a  composer of high merit, which fact was revealed in his piano and vocal  compositions. The American people were most kind and appreciative to  him. When the disaster came and he was lost at sea, the testimonial they  sent his orphaned children was a goodly sum, though I hardly think the  children appreciated your goodness.    \"Among the composers in Spain who have turned their gifts toward  operatic channels I can mention Pedrell, Morea, Falla, Vives and Breton.  Vives is now writing an opera for me, entitled _Abanico_. Gradually, no  doubt, the music of our country, especially its opera, will find its  way to other lands. Even in England, I am told, Spanish music is very  little known; our many distinguished modern musicians are hardly even  names. Of course the world knows our Toreador songs, our castanet  dances, and the like; perhaps they think we have little or no serious  music, because it is still unknown. Spanish music is peculiar to the  country; it is permeated with the national spirit and feeling.\"    Asked if she would sing in South America during the vacation, the singer  answered:    \"I have sung there with great success. But I shall not be able to go  there this summer. My little boy has been placed in a school in France;  it is the first time we have been separated, and it has been very hard  for me to have the ocean between us. I shall sing at Atlanta, the first  week of May, and then sail the middle of the month for France. Yes,  indeed, I hope to return to America next season.    \"I trust you have been able to understand my poor English,\" she said  smiling, as she parted with her visitor; \"we speak several languages  here in my home--Spanish with my mother and friends, French and Italian  with others in the household. But there seems little necessity for using  English, even though I am living in the heart of the metropolis.  Perhaps next year, I shall master your language better.\"    And the picture of her, as she stood in her artistic, home-like salon,  with its lights, its pictures and flowers, is even more lasting than any  to be remembered on the operatic stage.          XVI    =CLAUDIA MUZIO=    A CHILD OF THE OPERA    [Illustration: CLAUDIA MUZIO]    In tales of romance one reads sometimes of a gifted girl who lives in a  musical atmosphere all her life, imbibing artistic influences as  naturally and almost as unconsciously as the air she breathes. At the  right moment, she suddenly comes out into the light and blossoms into a  full fledged singer, to the surprise and wonder of all her friends. Or  she is brought up behind the scenes in some great Opera House of the  world, where, all unnoticed by her elders, she lives in a dream world of  her own, peopled by the various characters in the operas to which she  daily listens. She watches the stage so closely and constantly that she  unconsciously commits the roles of the heroines she most admires, to  memory. She knows what they sing, how they act the various parts, how  they impersonate the characters. Again, at the right moment, the leading  prima donna is indisposed, there is no one to take her place; manager  is in despair, when the slip of a girl, who is known to have a voice,  but has never sung in opera, offers to go on in place of the absent one.  She is finally permitted to do so; result, a popular success.    Some pages of Claudia Muzio's musical story read like the romantic  experiences of a novel-heroine. She, too, was brought up in great opera  houses, and it seemed natural, that in due course of time, she should  come into her own, in the greatest lyric theater of the land of her  adoption.    When she returned to America, a couple of years ago, after gaining  experience in Europe, she arrived toward the end of the season preceding  her scheduled debut here, to prepare herself more fully for the coming  appearance awaiting her.    I was asked to meet and talk with the young singer, to ascertain her  manner of study, and some of her ideas regarding the work which lay  before her.           *       *       *       *       *    \"It was always my dream to sing at the Metropolitan, and my dream has  come true.\"    Claudia Muzio said the words with her brilliant smile, as her great soft  dark eyes gazed luminously at the visitor.    The day was cold and dreary without, but the singer's apartment was of  tropical warmth. A great bowl of violets on the piano exhaled delicious  fragrance; the young Italian in the bloom of her oriental beauty, seemed  like some luxuriant tropical blossom herself.    Claudia Muzio, who was just about to take her place among the personnel  of the Metropolitan, is truly to the manner born,--a real child of the  opera. She has lived in opera all her life, has imbibed the operatic  atmosphere from her earliest remembrance. It must be as necessary for a  singer who aspires to fill a high place in this field of artistic  endeavor, to live amid congenial surroundings, as for a pianist,  violinist or composer to be environed by musical influences.    \"Yes, I am an Italian,\" she began, \"for I was born in Italy; but when I  was two years old I was taken to London, and my childhood was passed in  that great city. My father was stage manager at Covent Garden, and has  also held the same post at the Manhattan and Metropolitan Opera Houses  in New York. So I have grown up in the theater. I have always listened  to opera--daily, and my childish imagination was fired by seeing the art  of the great singers. I always hoped I should one day become a singer,  so I always watched the artists in action, noting how they did  everything. As a result, I do not now have to study acting as a separate  branch of the work, for acting comes to me naturally. I am very  temperamental; I feel intuitively how the role should be enacted.    \"All tiny children learn to sing little songs, and I was no exception. I  acquired quite a number, and at the age of six, exhibited my  accomplishments at a little recital. But I never had singing lessons  until I began to study seriously at about the age of sixteen. Although I  did not study the voice till I reached that age, I was always occupied  with music, for I learned as a little girl to play both harp and piano.    \"We lived in London, of which city I am very fond, from the time I was  two, till I was fourteen, then we came to America. After residing here a  couple of years, it was decided I should make a career, and we went to  Italy. I was taken to Madame Anna Casaloni at Turino. She was quite  elderly at that time, but she had been a great singer. When she tried my  voice, she told me it was quite properly placed--so I had none of that  drudgery to go through.    \"At first my voice was a very light soprano, hardly yet a coloratura. It  became so a little later, however, and then gradually developed into a  dramatic soprano. I am very happy about this fact, for I love to portray  tears as well as laughter--sorrow and tragedy as well as lightness and  gayety. The coloratura manner of singing is all delicacy and lightness,  and one cannot express deep emotion in this way.    \"We subsequently went to Milano, where I studied with Madame Viviani, a  soprano who had enjoyed great success on the operatic stage.    \"After several years of serious study I was ready to begin my career. So  I sang in Milan and other Italian cities, then at Covent Garden, and now  I am in the Metropolitan. In Italy I created the role of Fiora in _Amore  del tre Re_, and sang with Ferrari-Fontana. I also created Francesca in  _Francesca da Rimini_, under its composer, Zandonai. I have a repertoire  of about thirty"]]]
