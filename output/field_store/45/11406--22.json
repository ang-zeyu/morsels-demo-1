[2 grains]    Chloral hydrate,      gr. i. [1 grain]    Syrup,                M x. [10 minims]    Aq. menth. pip., ad   3 i. [1 dram]    After this has been taken the child should be laid down for a quarter  of an hour until soundly asleep. Then very gently he can be carried to  his mother and the nipple inserted. If in this way a few days of sound  sleep and less disturbed digestion can be secured, the difficulty will  in most cases permanently be overcome. The steadier suction and more  efficient emptying of the breast will promote a freer flow of milk,  and the deeper and more prolonged sleep will lower greatly the needs  of the child for food. Most of the babies who show this fault are  thin, meagre, and fidgety, and with some increase of muscular tone.  The head is held up well, the limbs are stiff, the hands clenched, the  abdomen retracted, with the outline of the recti muscles unusually  prominent. If we can relax this exaggerated state of nervous tension,  if we can help them to become fatter and to put on weight, the  dyspepsia will disappear with the other symptoms.    It is a question still to be answered whether the rare conditions of  pyloric spasm and pyloric hypertrophic stenosis are not further  developments of the same disturbance. Certainly these grave  complications appear most commonly in infants with a pronounced  nervous inheritance, and, as might be expected, they are more commonly  found in private practice than among the hospital classes.    In passing, we may note that there are babies who exhibit the opposite  fault, and in whom the contrary regimen must be instituted. Premature  children, children born in a very poor state of nutrition, and  children born with great difficulty, so that they are exhausted by the  violence of their passage into the world, are apt to show the opposite  fault of extreme somnolence. They are so little stimulated by their  surroundings, and they sleep so profoundly, that the sucking reflex is  not aroused. Put to the breast they continue to slumber, or after a  few half-hearted sucking movements relapse into sleep. We must rouse  such children by moving them about and stirring them to wakefulness  before we put them to the breast.    Once the child has been got to the breast, once the milk has become  firmly established, we have overcome the first great difficulty which  besets us in the management of nervous little babies, but it is by no  means the last. Restlessness and continual crying must be combated or  digestion suffers, and may show itself in a peculiar form of explosive  vomiting, which betokens the reflex excitability and unrest of the  stomach.    The sense of taste is as acute as all other sensations. If the child  is bottle-fed, the slightest change in diet is resented because of the  unfamiliar taste, and the whole may promptly be rejected. The tendency  to dyspeptic symptoms is apt to lead to much unwise changing of the  diet, and everything tried falls in turn into disrepute, until perhaps  all rational diets are abandoned, and some mixture of very faulty  construction, because of its temporary or accidental success, becomes  permanently adopted--a mixture perhaps so deficient in some necessary  constituent that, if it is persisted with, permanent damage to the  growth of the child results. We must pay less attention to changes of  diet and explore our management of the child to try and find how we  can make his environment more restful.    It is wise to accustom a nervous child from a very early age to take a  little water or fruit juice from a spoon every day. Otherwise when  breast-feeding or bottle-feeding is abandoned one may meet with the  most formidable resistance. Infants of a few months can be easily  taught; the resistance of a child of nine months or a year may be  difficult to overcome. The difficulty of weaning from the breast  recurs with great constancy in nervous children. By this time the  influence of environment has become clearly apparent. The child is  often enough already master of the situation, and is conscious of his  power. Such children will sometimes prefer to starve for days  together, obstinately opposing all attempts to get them to drink from  a spoon, a cup, or even a bottle. When this happens, sometimes the  only effective way is to change the environment and to send the baby  to a grandmother or an aunt, where in new surroundings and with new  attendants the resistance which was so strong at home may completely  disappear. When weaning is resented, and difficulties of this sort  arise, it is clear that the mother, whose breast is close at hand, is  at a great disadvantage in combating the child's opposition.    For nervous infants, alas! broken sleep is the rule. What, then, is to  be done? It is astonishing to me that any one who has studied the  behaviour of only a few of these nervous and restless infants should  uphold the teaching that the crying of the young infant is a bad  habit, and that the mother who is truly wise must neglect the cry and  leave him to learn the uselessness of his appeals. It is true that the  youngest child readily contracts habits good or bad. Either he will  learn the habit of sleep or the habit of crying. Mercifully the  inclination of the majority is towards sleep. But to encourage habits  of restlessness and crying there is no surer way than to follow this  bad advice and to permit the child to cry till he is utterly exhausted  in body and in mind. It is unwise _always_ to rock a baby to sleep; it  is also unwise to allow him to scream himself into a state of  hysteria. A quiet, darkened room, the steady pressure of the mother's  hand in some rhythmical movement, will often quiet an incipient  storm. The longer he cries, the more trouble it is to soothe him.  Sleep provokes sleep, so that often we find restlessness and sound  sleep alternating in a sort of cycle, a good week perhaps following a  bad one. The nurse who is quick to cut short a storm of crying and to  soothe the child again to sleep is helping him to form habits of  sleep. The nurse who leaves him to cry, believing that in time he will  of his own accord recognise the futility of his behaviour, is making  him form habits of crying. A rigid routine in sleep is a good thing,  but the routine belongs to the baby, not to the nurse. The child must  be educated to sleep, not taught to cry. A baby has but little power  of altering his position when it becomes strained or uncomfortable. He  cannot turn over and nestle down into a new posture. If we watch him  wake, the first stirring may be very gradual, and in a moment he may  fall again to sleep. A few minutes later he stirs again more strongly,  and is wider awake and for longer. It may only be after a third  waking, by a summation of stimuli, that he is finally roused and  breaks into loud crying. The nurse who is on the watch, who, sleeping  beside him, wakes at the slightest sound and is quick to turn him over  and settle him into a new position of rest, will probably report in  the morning that the baby has had a good night. The nurse who lets the  child grow wide awake and start crying loudly, will spend perhaps many  hours before quiet is again restored. Of the voluntary, purposive  crying of infants a little older I am not here speaking. Infants in  the second six months are quite capable of establishing a \"Tyranny of  Tears\" and feeling their power. Fortunately it requires no great  experience to distinguish one from the other, and to adopt for each  the appropriate treatment.    Again, in elementary teaching upon the management of infants stress is  laid, rightly enough, upon the importance of regularity in the times  of feeding, and on the observance in this respect also of a very  strict routine. But in the case of the very nervous infant a certain  latitude should be allowed to an experienced nurse or mother. We may  wreck everything by a blind adhesion to a too rigid scheme, which may  demand that we leave the child to scream for an hour before his meal,  or that, when at length he has fallen into a sound sleep after hours  of wakefulness, we should proceed to wake him.    Symptoms of dyspepsia which are due to continued nervous excitement  demand treatment which is very different from that which would be  appropriate to dyspepsia which is due to other causes, such as  overfeeding or unsuitable feeding. The temporary restriction of food,  which is commonly ordered in dyspepsia from these causes, is very  badly supported by the nervous infant. Hunger invariably increases the  unrest, and the unrest increases the dyspepsia.    The difficulties of managing a nervous infant are very real, and call  for the most exemplary patience on the part of the mother and the  clearest insight into the nature of the disturbance.          CHAPTER IX    MANAGEMENT IN LATER CHILDHOOD      In the early days in the nursery the actions of the infant, for the  most part, follow passively the traction exercised by nurses and  mothers, sometimes consciously, but more often unconsciously. We have  now to consider a period when the child becomes possessed of a driving  force of his own, and moves in this direction or that of his own  volition. In this new intellectual movement through life he will not  avoid tumbles. He will feel the restraints of his environment pressing  upon him on all sides, and he will often come violently in contact  with rigid rules and conventions to which he must learn to yield. From  time to time we read in the papers of some terrible accident in a  picture-palace, or in a theatre. Although there has been no fire,  there has been a cry of fire, and in the panic which ensues lives are  lost from the crowding and crushing. Yet all the time the doors have  stood wide open, and"]]]
