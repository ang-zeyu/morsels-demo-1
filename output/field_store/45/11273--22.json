I know you for a man with a fine sporting reputation,  and therefore I don't doubt your word. But Mr. Paul Harley disappeared  last night.\"    At last Nicol Brinn was moved. A second time he took the cigar from his  mouth, gazed at the end reflectively, and then hurled the cigar across  the room into the hearth. He stood up, walked to a window, and stared  out. \"Just sit quiet a minute,\" came the toneless voice. \"You've hit me  harder than you know. I want to think it out.\"    At the back of the tall, slim figure Detective Inspector Wessex stared  with a sort of wonder. Mr. Nicol Brinn of Cincinnati was a conundrum  which he found himself unable to catalogue, although in his gallery of  queer characters were many eccentric and peculiar. If Nicol Brinn should  prove to be crooked, then automatically he became insane. This Wessex  had reasoned out even before he had set eyes upon the celebrated  American traveller. His very first glimpse of Nicol Brinn had confirmed  his reasoning, except that the cool, calm strength of the man had done  much to upset the theory of lunacy.    Followed an interval of unbroken silence. Not even the ticking of a  clock could be heard in that long, singularly furnished apartment. Then,  as the detective continued to gaze upon the back of Mr. Nicol Brinn,  suddenly the latter turned.    \"Detective Inspector Wessex,\" he said, \"there has been a cloud hanging  over my head for seven years. That cloud is going to burst very soon,  and it looks as if it were going to do damage.\"    \"I don't understand you, sir,\" replied the detective, bluntly. \"But I  have been put in charge of the most extraordinary case that has ever  come my way and I'll ask you to make yourself as clear as possible.\"    \"I'll do all I can,\" Nicol Brinn assured him. \"But first tell me  something: Why have you come to me for information in respect to Mr.  Paul Harley?\"    \"I'll answer your question,\" said Wessex, and the fact did not escape  the keen observing power of Nicol Brinn that the detective's manner had  grown guarded. \"He informed Mr. Innes, his secretary, before setting  out, that he was coming here to your chambers.\"    Nicol Brinn stared blankly at the speaker. \"He told him that? When?\"    \"Yesterday.\"    \"That he was coming here?\"    \"He did.\"    Nicol Brinn sat down again upon the settee. \"Detective Inspector,\" said  he, \"I give you my word of honour as a gentleman that I last saw Mr.  Paul Harley at ten-fifteen on Wednesday night. Since then, not only have  I not seen him, but I have received no communication from him.\"    The keen glance of the detective met and challenged the dull glance of  the speaker. \"I accept your word, sir,\" said Wessex, finally, and he  sighed and scratched his chin in the manner of a man hopelessly puzzled.    Silence fell again. The muted sounds of Piccadilly became audible in the  stillness. Cabs and cars rolled by below, their occupants all unaware  of the fact that in that long, museum-like room above their heads lay the  key to a tragedy and the clue to a mystery.    \"Look here, sir,\" said the detective, suddenly, \"the result of Mr. Paul  Harley's investigations right up to date has been placed in my hands,  together with all his notes. I wonder if you realize the fact that,  supposing Mr. Harley does not return, I am in repossession of sufficient  evidence to justify me in putting you under arrest?\"    \"I see your point quite clearly,\" replied Nicol Brinn. \"I have seen my  danger since the evening that Mr. Paul Harley walked into this room: but  I'll confess I did not anticipate this particular development.\"    \"To get right down to business,\" said Wessex, \"if Mr. Paul Harley did  not come here, where, in your idea, did he go?\"    Nicol Brinn considered the speaker meditatively. \"If I knew that,\" said  he, \"maybe I could help. I told him here in this very room that the pair  of us were walking on the edge of hell. I don't like to say it, and you  don't know all it means, but in my opinion he has taken a step too far.\"    Detective Inspector Wessex stood up impatiently. \"You have already  talked in that strain to Mr. Harley,\" he said, a bit brusquely. \"Mr.  Innes has reported something of the conversation to me. But I must  ask you to remember that, whereas Mr. Paul Harley is an unofficial  investigator, I am an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department,  and figures of speech are of no use to me. I want facts. I want plain  speaking. I ask you for help and you answer in parables. Now perhaps I  am saying too much, and perhaps I am not, but that Mr. Harley was right  in what he believed, the circumstances of his present disappearance go  to prove. He learned too much about something called Fire-Tongue.\"    Wessex spoke the word challengingly, staring straight into the eyes of  Nicol Brinn, but the latter gave no sign, and Wessex, concealing his  disappointment, continued: \"You know more about Fire-Tongue than you  ever told Mr. Paul Harley. All you know I have got to know. Mr. Harley  has been kidnapped, perhaps done to death.\"    \"Why do you say so?\" asked Nicol Brinn, rapidly.    \"Because I know it is so. It does not matter how I know.\"    \"You are certain that his absence is not voluntary?\"    \"We have definite evidence to that effect.\"    \"I don't expect you to be frank with me, Detective Inspector, but I'll  be as frank with you as I can be. I haven't the slightest idea in the  world where Mr. Harley is. But I have information which, if I knew where  he was, would quite possibly enable me to rescue him.\"    \"Provided he is alive!\" added Wessex, angrily.    \"What leads you to suppose that he is not?\"    \"If he is alive, he is a prisoner.\"    \"Good God!\" said Nicol Brinn in a low voice. \"It has come.\" He took a  step toward the detective. \"Mr. Wessex,\" he continued, \"I don't tell you  to do whatever your duty indicates; I know you will do it. But in the  interests of everybody concerned I have a request to make. Have me  watched if you like--I suppose that's automatic. But whatever happens,  and wherever your suspicions point, give me twenty-four hours. As I  think you can see, I am a man who thinks slowly, but moves with a rush.  You can believe me or not, but I am even more anxious than you are to  see this thing through. You think I know what lies back of it all, and I  don't say that you are not right. But one thing you don't know, and that  thing I can't tell you. In twenty-four hours I might be able to tell  you. Whatever happens, even if poor Harley is found dead, don't hamper  my movements between now and this time tomorrow.\"    Wessex, who had been watching the speaker intently, suddenly held out  his hand. \"It's a bet!\" he said. \"It's my case, and I'll conduct it in  my own way.\"    \"Mr. Wessex,\" replied Nicol Brinn, taking the extended hand, \"I think  you are a clever man. There are questions you would like to ask me, and  there are questions I would like to ask you. But we both realize the  facts of the situation, and we are both silent. One thing I'll say: You  are in the deadliest peril you have ever known. Be careful. Believe me I  mean it. Be very careful.\"        CHAPTER XIV. WESSEX GETS BUSY    Innes rose from the chair usually occupied by Paul Harley as Detective  Inspector Wessex, with a very blank face, walked into the office. Innes  looked haggard and exhibited unmistakable signs of anxiety. Since he  had received that dramatic telephone message from his chief he had not  spared himself for a moment. The official machinery of Scotland Yard was  at work endeavouring to trace the missing man, but since it had proved  impossible to find out from where the message had been sent, the  investigation was handicapped at the very outset. Close inquiries at the  Savoy Hotel had shown that Harley had not been there. Wessex, who was a  thorough artist within his limitations, had satisfied himself that none  of the callers who had asked for Ormuz Khan, and no one who had loitered  about the lobbies, could possibly have been even a disguised Paul  Harley.    To Inspector Wessex the lines along which Paul Harley was operating  remained a matter of profound amazement and mystification. His interview  with Mr. Nicol Brinn had only served to baffle him more hopelessly than  ever. The nature of Paul Harley's inquiries--inquiries which, presumably  from the death of Sir Charles Abingdon, had led him to investigate the  movements of two persons of international repute, neither apparently  having even the most remote connection with anything crooked--was a  conundrum for the answer to which the detective inspector sought in  vain.    \"I can see you have no news,\" said Innes, dully.    \"To be perfectly honest,\" replied Wessex, \"I feel like a man who is  walking in his sleep. Except for the extraordinary words uttered by  the late Sir Charles Abingdon, I fail to see that there is any possible  connection between his death and Mr. Nicol Brinn. I simply can't fathom  what Mr. Harley was working upon. To my mind there is not the slightest  evidence of foul play in the case. There is no motive; apart from which,  there is absolutely no link.\"    \"Nevertheless,\" replied Innes, slowly, \"you know the chief, and  therefore you know as well as I do that he would not have instructed  me to communicate with you unless he had definite evidence in his  possession. It is perfectly clear that he was interrupted in the act of  telephoning. He was literally dragged away from the instrument.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#18)"],[1,"was possessed of  a spirit that cannot rest, so to speak, unless at work. He was able to  do almost anything _after a fashion_, and was never idle for a moment.  Even when his hands chanced to be unemployed, his brows were knitted,  busily planning what to do next.    \"Well now, gentlemen,\" resumed the captain, \"let us consider the order  of business. The first thing that must be done now is to unstow the hold  and deposit its contents on the small island astern of us, which we  shall call Store Island, for brevity's sake. Get a tent pitched there,  Mr. Bolton, and bank it up with snow. You can leave Grim to superintend  the unloading.--Then, Mr. Saunders, do you go and set a gang of men to  cut a canal through the young ice from the ship to the island.  Fortunately the floes there are wide enough apart to let our  quarter-boats float between them. The unshipping won't take long. Tell  Buzzby to take a dozen men with him and collect moss; we'll need a large  quantity for fuel, and if another storm like this comes it'll be hard  work to get down to it. Send Meetuck to me when you go on deck; I shall  talk to him as to our prospects of finding deer hereabouts, and arrange  a hunt.--Doctor, you may either join the hunting-party, or post up the  observations, etc., which have accumulated of late.\"    \"Thank you, captain,\" said Singleton; \"I'll accept the latter duty, the  more willingly that I wish to have a careful examination of my botanical  specimens.\"    \"And what am I to do, captain?\" inquired Fred.    \"What you please, lad.\"    \"Then I'll go and take care of Meetuck; he's apt to get into mischief  when left--\"    At this moment a tremendous shout of laughter, long continued, came from  the deck, and a sound as if numbers of men dancing overhead was heard.    The party in the cabin seized their caps and sprang up the companion  ladder, where they beheld a scene that accounted for the laughter, and  induced them to join in it. At first sight it seemed as if thirty Polar  bears had boarded the vessel, and were executing a dance of triumph  before proceeding to make a meal of the crew; but on closer inspection  it became apparent that the men had undergone a strange transformation,  and were capering with delight at the ridiculous appearance they  presented. They were clad from head to foot in Esquimau costume, and now  bore as strong a resemblance to Polar bears as man could attain to.    Meetuck was the pattern and the chief instrument in effecting this  change. At Upernavik Captain Guy had been induced to purchase a large  number of fox-skins, deer-skins, seal-skins, and other furs, as a  speculation, and had them tightly packed and stowed away in the hold,  little imagining the purpose they were ultimately destined to serve.  Meetuck had come on board in a mongrel sort of worn-out seal-skin dress;  but the instant the cold weather set in he drew from a bundle which he  had brought with him a dress made of the fur of the Arctic fox, some of  the skins being white and the others blue. It consisted of a loose coat,  somewhat in the form of a shirt, with a large hood to it, and a short  elongation behind like the commencement of a tail. The boots were made  of white bear-skin, which, at the end of the foot, were made to  terminate with the claws of the animal; and they were so long that they  came up the thigh under the coat, or \"jumper,\" as the men called it, and  thus served instead of trousers. He also wore fur mittens, with a bag  for the fingers, and a separate little bag for the thumb. The hair on  these garments was long and soft, and worn outside, so that when a man  enveloped himself in them, and put up the hood, which well-nigh  concealed the face, he became very much like a bear or some such  creature standing on its hind legs.    Meetuck was a short, fat, burly little fellow by nature; but when he put  on his winter dress he became such a round, soft, squat, hairy, and  comical-looking creature, that no one could look at him without  laughing, and the shout with which he was received on deck the first  time he made his appearance in his new costume was loud and prolonged.  But Meetuck was as good-humoured an Esquimau as ever speared a walrus or  lanced a Polar bear. He joined in the laugh, and cut a caper or two to  show that he entered into the spirit of the joke.    When the ship was set fast, and the thermometer fell pretty low, the men  found that their ordinary dreadnoughts and pea-jackets, etc., were not a  sufficient protection against the cold, and it occurred to the captain  that his furs might now be turned to good account. Sailors are  proverbially good needle-men of a rough kind. Meetuck showed them how to  set about their work. Each man made his own garments, and in less than a  week they were completed. It is true, the boots perplexed them a little,  and the less ingenious among the men made very rare and curious-looking  foot-gear for themselves; but they succeeded after a fashion, and at  last the whole crew appeared on deck in their new habiliments, as we  have already mentioned, capering among the snow like bears, to their  own entire satisfaction and to the intense delight of Meetuck, who now  came to regard the white men as brothers--so true is it that \"the tailor  makes the man!\"    \"'Ow 'orribly 'eavy it is, _h_ain't it?\" gasped Mivins, after dancing  round the main-hatch till he was nearly exhausted.    \"Heavy!\" cried Buzzby, whose appearance was such that you would have  hesitated to say whether his breadth or length was greater--\"heavy, d'ye  say? It must be your sperrits wot's heavy, then, for I feel as light as  a feather myself.\"    \"O morther! then may I niver sleep on a bed made o' sich feathers!\"  cried O'Riley, capering up to Green, the carpenter's mate, and throwing  a mass of snow in his face. The frost rendered it impossible to form the  snow into balls, but the men made up for this by throwing it about each  other's eyes and ears in handfuls.    \"What d'ye mean by insultin' my mate?--take that!\" said Peter Grim,  giving the Irishman a twirl that tumbled him on the deck.    \"Oh, bad manners to ye!\" spluttered O'Riley, as he rose and ran away;  \"why don't ye hit a man o' yer own size?\"    \"'Deed, then, it must be because there's not one o' my own size to hit,\"  remarked the carpenter with a broad grin.    This was true. Grim's colossal proportions were increased so much by his  hairy dress that he seemed to have spread out into the dimensions of  two large men rolled into one. But O'Riley was not to be overturned with  impunity. Skulking round behind the crew, who were laughing at Grim's  joke, he came upon the giant in the rear, and seizing the short tail of  his jumper, pulled him violently down on the deck.    \"Ah, then, give it him, boys!\" cried O'Riley, pushing the carpenter flat  down, and obliterating his black beard and his whole visage in a mass of  snow. Several of the wilder spirits among the men leaped on the  prostrate Grim, and nearly smothered him before he could gather himself  up for a struggle; then they fled in all directions while their victim  regained his feet, and rushed wildly after them. At last he caught  O'Riley, and grasping him by the two shoulders gave him a heave that was  intended and \"calc'lated,\" as Amos Parr afterwards remarked, \"to pitch  him over the foretop-sail-yard!\" But an Irishman is not easily overcome.  O'Riley suddenly straightened himself and held his arms up over his  head, and the violent heave, which, according to Parr, was to have sent  him to such an uncomfortable elevation, only pulled the jumper  completely off his body, and left him free to laugh in the face of his  big friend, and run away.    At this point the captain deemed it prudent to interfere.    \"Come, come, my lads!\" he cried, \"enough o' this. That's not the morning  work, is it? I'm glad to find that your new dresses,\" he added with a  significant smile, \"make you fond of rough work in the snow; there's  plenty of it before us.--Come down below with me, Meetuck; I wish to  talk with you.\"    As the captain descended to the cabin the men gave a final cheer, and in  ten minutes they were working laboriously at their various duties.    Buzzby and his party were the first ready and off to cut moss. They drew  a sledge after them towards the red-snow valley, which was not more than  two miles distant from the ship. This \"mossing,\" as it was termed, was  by no means a pleasant duty. Before the winter became severe, the moss  could be cut out from the beds of the snow streams with comparative  ease; but now the mixed turf of willows, heaths, grasses, and moss was  frozen solid, and had to be quarried with crowbars and carried to the  ship like so much stone. However, it was prosecuted vigorously, and a  sufficient quantity was soon procured to pack on the deck of the ship,  and around its sides, so as to keep out the cold. At the same time, the  operation of discharging the stores was carried on briskly; and Fred, in  company with Meetuck, O'Riley, and Joseph West, started with the  dog-sledge on a hunting-expedition.    In order to enable the reader better to understand the condition of the  _Dolphin_ and her crew, we will detail the several arrangements that  were made at this time and during the succeeding fortnight. As a measure  of precaution, the ship, by means of blasting, sawing, and warping, was  with great labour got into deeper water, where one night's frost set  her fast with a sheet of ice three inches thick round her. In a few  weeks this ice became several feet thick; and the snow drifted up her  hull so much that it seemed as if she were resting on the land, and had  taken final leave of her native element. Strong hawsers were then  secured to Store Island, in order to guard against the possibility of  her being carried away by any sudden disruption of the ice. The  disposition of the masts, yards, and sails was next determined on. The  "]]]
