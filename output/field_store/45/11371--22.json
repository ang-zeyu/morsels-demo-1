Pack in hot jars or cans to within 1/2 inch from top. Add 1  teaspoonful salt per quart. Put on a good rubber and partially seal  the jar, completely seal tin cans.    7. Place jars or cans in canner and process in _boiling_ water for  three hours. Three hours sterilization will insure the keeping of all  varieties of fish, providing fresh products are used and the blanching  and other work is carefully done. If canning with a steam-pressure  canner or a pressure cooker sterilize for one hour and a half under 10  to 15 lbs. pressure.    8. At the end of the sterilizing period cool the jars quickly after  sealing completely. The tin cans may be cooled by immersing them in  cold water.    9. Store for future use.      SOFTENING OF BONES IN FISH    This can be done satisfactorily under pressure. The bones of fish are  composed of large quantities of harmless lime, bound by a matrix of  collagen, which is insoluble under ordinary conditions. When subjected  to a high temperature under pressure this collagen is converted into  gelatin and dissolved, leaving the bones soft and friable and even  edible. Bony fish, such as herring and shad, which are too small to  use otherwise are greatly improved when subjected to steam under  pressure.    The bones in herring are softened in 37 minutes at a temperature of  240 degrees; shad in 1 hour; flounder 1 hour. Other fish are fully  cooked and the bones softened in times approximately proportionate to  the size of the bones.    The following table was made after many experiments and gives the time  required to soften the bones in many common species of fish.    The term \"softening\" means the point in cooking when the small bones,  ribs, etc., are soft, but when the large vertebrae are not yet  sufficiently soft to be consumed along with the meat. In some of the  larger fishes where the large bones could scarcely be eaten, even if  they were softened, it would appear to be a waste of time and fuel to  carry them to a point of complete cooking, and in such cases it ought  to be sufficient to soften the small bones and sterilize the contents  of the can. For such a purpose, the \"softening\" rather than the \"soft\"  point, may be used.    The time periods are measured from the point when the given pressure  and temperature are reached (at the top of the cooker) to the time  when the heat is shut off. The heating-up and cooling-off period of  time are therefore not included. The fish were salted, but no water  was added.    Samples of fish canned during the course of these experiments were  kept six weeks at room temperature (about 68 deg. F.) and were then  incubated at 98 deg. F. for 48 hrs. All were sterile.

Clean the fish and remove entrails. Split along the back and remove  backbone.    2. Place in brine strong enough to float an Irish potato.

Lewis, lacking his rival's magnetic and emotional qualities,  cold, scholarly, and accurate in performance, was regarded as a  statesman of high promise[127]. Other Cabinet members, as is the custom  of coalitions, were more free in opinion and action than in a strict  party ministry where one dominating personality imposes his will upon  his colleagues.    Lord John Russell, then, in foreign policy, was more than the main voice  of the Government; rather, save in times of extreme crisis, governmental  foreign policy was Russell's policy. This was even more true as regards  American than European affairs, for the former were little understood,  and dependence was necessarily placed upon the man whose business it was  to be familiar with them. Indeed there was little actual parliamentary  or governmental interest, before midsummer of 1861, in the American  question, attention in foreign affairs being directed toward Italian  expansion, to the difficulties related to the control of the Ionian  islands, and to the developing Danish troubles in Schleswig-Holstein.  Neither did the opposition party venture to express a policy as regards  America. Lord Derby, able but indolent, occasionally indulged in caustic  criticism, but made no attempt to push his attack home. Malmesbury, his  former Foreign Secretary, was active and alert in French affairs, but  gave no thought to relations across the Atlantic[128]. Disraeli, Tory  leader in the Commons, skilfully led a strong minority in attacks on the  Government's policy, but never on the American question, though  frequently urged to do so by the friends of the South. In short for the  first year of the Civil War, 1861, the policy of Great Britain toward  America was the policy of Lord John Russell, unhampered by friend  or foe.    This being the case, what did Russell know about the American crisis?  Briefly, no more than has already been stated as derived from the  reports of British officials in the United States, and from the pages of  the public press. The salient facts known to Russell were few. Lincoln's  Cabinet had been named. Lincoln himself was absolutely an unknown  quantity, but it was unbelievable that a man of his origins and history  could be more than a mere figurehead--an opinion then held as widely in  America as in England. But someone must determine American policy, and  by universal consent, this would be Seward.    The new Secretary of State was at the moment better known in England  than any other American statesman, with the possible exception of  Charles Sumner, whose visits and personal contacts had established a  circle of British friendships. Both men were accepted as champions of  anti-slavery, Sumner for his vigorous denunciations and his so-called  \"martyrdom\" under the physical violence of the South Carolinan, Brooks;  and Seward for his clever political anti-Southern leadership in the  United States Senate. But Seward's reputation in this respect was offset  by the belief that he was anti-British in his personal sentiments, or at  least that he was very ready to arouse for political ends the customary  anti-British sentiment of his Irish constituents in the State of New  York. In 1860, on the occasion of the visit to the United States of the  Prince of Wales, Seward is alleged to have stated to the Duke of  Newcastle that in case he became Secretary of State it would then  \"become my duty to insult England, and I mean to do so\"--a threat,  whether jocose or not, that aroused much serious and anxious speculation  in British governmental circles[129]. Moreover Seward's reputation was  that of a wily, clever politician, rather unscrupulous in methods which  British politicians professed to disdain--a reputation serving to dim  somewhat, as indeed it did in America also, the sincere idealisms and  patriotism of the statesman. Altogether, Seward was regarded in Great  Britain as a rather dangerous man, yet as the inevitable guiding power  in the new Republican administration.    This estimate was shared by many in the United States also, but not by  all. The new American Minister to London, Charles Francis Adams, himself  a most stiffly upright politician, both regarded Seward as the only  possible leader of Republican party policy and rejoiced that this was  so, having great confidence in his chief's integrity and wisdom. Adams  himself was well suited to his new post. He was known as having early in  1849 fought the battle of anti-slavery as a \"Free Soil Whig,\" and later  as a leading Republican member of Congress from Massachusetts.  Principally, however, he was suited to his post by education, family,  and character. He had been taken as a boy to Russia during his father's  ministry at St. Petersburg, and later had been educated in England. His  father and grandfather, John Quincy Adams and John Adams, both  Presidents of the United States, had both, also, been American Ministers  at London. Intensely patriotic, but having wide acquaintance through  training and study with European affairs, especially those of Britain,  and equipped with high intellectual gifts, Adams was still further  fitted to his new post by his power of cool judgment and careful  expression in critical times. His very coolness, sometimes appearing as  coldness and stiff dignity, rendered him an especially fit agent to deal  with Russell, a man of very similar characteristics. The two men quickly  learned to respect and esteem each other, whatever clash arose in  national policies.    But meanwhile Adams, in April, 1861, was not yet arrived in London. The  Southern Government organized at Montgomery, Alabama, but soon  transferred to Richmond, Virginia, was headed by Jefferson Davis as  President and Alexander Stephens as Vice-President. Neither man was well  known in England, though both had long been prominent in American  politics. The little British information on Davis, that he had served in  the United States Senate and as a Cabinet member, seemed to indicate  that he was better fitted to executive duties than his rival, Lincoln.  But Davis' foreign policy was wholly a matter for speculation, and his  Cabinet consisted of men absolutely unknown to British statesmen. In  truth it was not a Cabinet of distinction, for it was the misfortune of  the South that everywhere, as the Civil War developed, Southern  gentlemen sought reputation and glory in the army rather than in  political position. Nor did President Davis himself ever fully grasp the  importance to the South of a well-considered and energetic foreign  policy. At first, indeed, home controversy compelled anxious attention  to the exclusion of other matters. Until war cemented Southern  patriotism, Davis, himself regarded as an extremist, felt it necessary  in denial of an asserted unreasonableness of personal attitude, to  appoint to office men known for their earlier moderate opinions on both  slavery and secession[130]. \"The single exception to this general  policy[131]\" was the appointment as agents to Europe of Yancey, Rost and  Mann, all of them extreme pro-slavery men and eager secessionists. Of  these Mann was the only one with any previous diplomatic experience.  Yancey's choice was particularly inappropriate, for he at least was  known abroad as the extreme fire-eating Southern orator, demanding for  ten years past, that Southern action in defence of states rights and  Southern \"interests,\" which now, at last, the South was attempting[132].    Yancey and Rost, starting on their journey on March 16, reached London  on April 29[133]. Meanwhile in this same month of April, conditions in  America, so long confused and uncertain, were being rapidly clarified.  The South, earlier than the North, had come to a determined policy, for  while during January and February, at the Montgomery convention, there  had been uncertainty as to actively applying the doctrinaire right of  secession, by March the party of action had triumphed, and though there  was still talk of conferences with the North, and commissioners actually  appointed, no real expectation existed of a favourable result. In the  North, the determination of policy was more slowly developed. Lincoln  was not inaugurated until March 4, and no positive pronouncement was  earlier possible. Even after that date uncertainty still prevailed.  European correspondents were reporting men like Sumner as willing to let  the South go in peace. The Mayor of New York City was discussing the  advisability of a separate secession by that financial centre from  Nation and State alike--and of setting up as a \"free town.\" Seward, just  appointed Secretary of State, was repudiating in both official and  private talk any intention to coerce the South by force of arms[134]. It  is no wonder that British statesmen were largely at sea over the  American situation.    But on April 13, 1861, the Stars and Stripes floating over Fort Sumter  in Charleston harbour was lowered in surrender of a Federal fortress  under the armed attack of the newly-born Confederacy. That event drove  away as by magic the uncertainty of the North, and removed the last  vestiges of Southern doubt. A great wave of militant patriotism swept  over both sections[135]. Hurriedly both North and South prepared for  war, issuing calls for volunteers and organizing in all accustomed  warlike preparations. The news of Sumter reached London on April 27, and  that civil war seemed certain was known on April 29. On April 17, Davis,  since the South lacked a navy, approved a proclamation offering to issue  letters of marque and reprisal.
