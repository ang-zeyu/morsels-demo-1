The whole subject resolved       itself into this: Representation. One hundred years ago, one of our       distinguished statesmen in England, Charles James Fox, said that       \"representation was the sovereign remedy for all evils,\" and that       was what was contended for by Imperial Federation. He would now       venture to make some allusion to one of the most distinguished       statesmen in South Africa, who attended the Conference in       London--he alluded to Mr. Hofmeyr--who made a most remarkable       speech. He was sorry it was too long to read, but he would select a       portion of that very statesmanlike address. Referring to the fourth       and eighth subjects proposed for discussion--viz., the feasibility       of promoting a closer union between the various parts of the       British Empire by means of an Imperial tariff of Customs, to be       levied independently of the duties payable under existing tariffs       on goods entering the British Empire from abroad, the revenue       derived from such tariffs to be devoted to the general defence of       the Empire--he said: \"I have taken this matter in hand with two       objects, to promote the union of the Empire, and at the same time       to obtain revenue for general defence. It would establish a       connecting link between the Colonies mutually, as well as between       the Colonies, and the Empire also, such as is not at present in       existence, and which might fuller develop, by-and-by, into a most       powerful bond of union.\" Again, speaking of how this was to be       effected, he said: \"A body would be required with legislative, and,       to some extent, administrative powers; in other words, you would       have a limited fiscal Parliament by the side of the British       Parliament and the various Colonial Parliaments. This small body,       which would have to be created, would perhaps be the germ of an       Imperial Federation afterwards.\" He thought those were most       remarkable, and striking words. If people would think the subject       out in a calm judicial, and fair spirit, they would see in it the       fulfilment of what would not only promote the best interests of the       British Empire, but would also be the handmaiden of civilization to       others as well, because in it there was no idea of aggrandisement.       He had recently made a most remarkable tour through this       interesting country, and since he landed in Cape Town, on the 24th       May, had seen a great deal of it. He had visited Kimberley, and       gone down in a bucket to see one of the diamond mines; he had       travelled to Vryburg, and across the treeless desert in the       south-western portion of the Transvaal to Klerksdorp; thence on to       Johannesburg and down the gold mines, and further on to Pretoria,       where he had an interview with President Kruger, and attended       meetings of the Volksraad. He had been 150 miles north of Pretoria,       and dwelt for a fortnight in the open veldt, without going near a       house, and had seen the Kafirs in their kraals. He had crossed the       Transvaal, through Heidelburg and Newcastle, in Natal, down to       Durban, he had visited Port Elizabeth and Grahamstown, and had now       returned to Cape Town. What he had seen of this great country had       astonished him, and he thought it had a vast future before it; but       it required to be governed in the most enlightened and satisfactory       manner, and he appealed to both races--Dutch and English--to       co-operate and unite in developing its wonderful resources. It was       by this way alone--by cordial co-operation and a generous feeling       towards one another, that this would be realized. He believed that       Imperial Federation would be the best solution of the difficulties       which had arisen. He had heard whispers of what was called       Republicanism. We worshipped words rather than things; but the       British Constitution, especially when it would be expanded by       Federation, would be practically a Republic with a Queen as       President. He would, therefore, appeal once more to the judgment of       thoughtful men to weigh the principles contended for, calmly,       wisely, and without prejudice or passion. The flippant, the       superficial, the thoughtlessly ambitious, and those who did not       take a fair, judicial, and comprehensive view of the great issues       involved in it to each portion of the Empire over which the British       Crown held sway, might deride and condemn it, but he, as one of its       most ardent pioneers and supporters, recommended it to all       colonists as well as to his countrymen at home, as the best       preservation of their commercial, social, and political interests       in the future, which they would lose altogether if they abandoned       it in favour of the disintegration of the British Empire. He had       studied this question for some years, and by a sort of instinct he       felt that it was the right thing to be brought about. He had       brought before them proofs that some distinguished men were already       feeling the desirability of some such thing being effected, and he       could not but help thinking that their ranks would be augmented by       other people of influence and power, who may hereafter be brought       to think seriously and carefully over this great question. He took       the opportunity himself, some three years ago, to put a letter in       the London _Times_ suggesting that as the question had now been       some years before the public, both in the Colonies and the Mother       Country, it would be very desirable indeed if a Royal Commission of       Inquiry were sent out, under distinguished auspices, for the       purpose of ascertaining the opinions of the various Colonies. This       could be carried out on parallel lines to the celebrated Commission       sent to Canada, and which resulted in the consolidation of the       Dominion. The obtaining of these opinions would be invaluable       evidence as to the consensus of feeling in the Colonies on the       subject. If the question was to be more than a dream, and became       one of practical politics, it would require all the Colonies to       express an opinion on the subject. He could not conceive that       anything could be more desirable than to take the evidence of       distinguished representative men on such a great National question.       Those were the views he expressed in the leading journal; they were       individual ideas, which did not yet appear to be acceptable, though       he could not help hoping that the day would arrive when some such       Royal Commission might be appointed, which would give an impetus to       the question--and, at all events, afford all those who took such a       deep interest in it an opportunity of seeing how far, in the       opinion of the various Colonies, such a change in the British       Constitution could be effected, to the entire satisfaction of all       concerned. There was no desire on the part of the Mother Country,       in propounding questions like this, to take any advantage of the       Colonies, or do anything which would not be for their benefit.       There was no hurry on the part of the Mother Country, which simply       asked the Colonies to help to govern and take part in the National       politics of the British Empire.         Mr. J.A. BAM proposed a vote of thanks to Sir Frederick Young for       his able and instructive lecture, which was heartily accorded.         SIR FREDERICK YOUNG having acknowledged the compliment, the       proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the President.

We walked with a regular  step, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the  slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is  unaccustomed on the earth; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound  than air, in the ratio of four to one.  At this period the earth sloped  downwards; the light took a uniform tint.  We were at a depth of a  hundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six  atmospheres.    At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun, though feebly; to  their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest  state between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was  not necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet.  At this  moment Captain Nemo stopped; he waited till I joined him, and then  pointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance.    \"It is the forest of the Island of Crespo,\" thought I; and I was not  mistaken.        CHAPTER XVI    A SUBMARINE FOREST    We had at last arrived on the borders of this forest, doubtless one of  the finest of Captain Nemo's immense domains.  He looked upon it as his  own, and considered he had the same right over it that the first men  had in the first days of the world.  And, indeed, who would have  disputed with him the possession of this submarine property?  What  other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark  copses?    This forest was composed of large tree-plants; and the moment we  penetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck by the singular  position of their branches--a position I had not yet observed.    Not an herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed the  trees, was either broken or bent, nor did they extend horizontally; all  stretched up to the surface of the ocean.  Not a filament, not a  ribbon, however thin they might be, but kept as straight as a rod of  iron.  The fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to  the density of the element which had produced them.  Motionless yet,  when bent to one side by the hand, they directly resumed their former  position.  Truly it was the region of perpendicularity!    I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position, as well as to the  comparative darkness which surrounded us.  The soil of the forest  seemed covered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid.  The submarine  flora struck me as being very perfect, and richer even than it would  have been in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are  not so plentiful.  But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the  genera, taking animals for plants; and who would not have been  mistaken?  The fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this  submarine world.    These plants are self-propagated, and the principle of their existence  is in the water, which upholds and nourishes them.  The greater number,  instead of leaves, shoot forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised  within a scale of colours pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown.    \"Curious anomaly, fantastic element!\" said an ingenious naturalist, \"in  which the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!\"    In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt; I, for my part,  was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariae,  the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows.    This short rest seemed delicious to me; there was nothing wanting but  the charm of conversation; but, impossible to speak, impossible to  answer, I only put my great copper head to Conseil's.  I saw the worthy  fellow's eyes glistening with delight, and, to show his satisfaction,  he shook himself in his breastplate of air, in the most comical way in  the world.    After four hours of this walking, I was surprised not to find myself  dreadfully hungry.  How to account for this state of the stomach I  could not tell.  But instead I felt an insurmountable desire to sleep,  which happens to all divers.  And my eyes soon closed behind the thick  glasses, and I fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone had  prevented before.  Captain Nemo and his robust companion, stretched in  the clear crystal, set us the example.    How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge, but, when  I woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon.  Captain Nemo had  already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an  unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.    A few steps off, a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches  high, was watching me with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.  Though my diver's dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of  this animal, I could not help shuddering with horror.  Conseil and the  sailor of the Nautilus awoke at this moment.  Captain Nemo pointed out  the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun  knocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in  terrible convulsions.  This incident reminded me that other animals  more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose  attacks my diving-dress would not protect me.  I had never thought of  it before, but I now resolved to be upon my guard.  Indeed, I thought  that this halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was  mistaken, for, instead of returning to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo  continued his bold excursion.  The ground was still on the incline, its  declivity seemed to be getting greater, and to be leading us to greater  depths.  It must have been about three o'clock when we reached a narrow  valley, between high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five  fathoms deep.  Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were  forty-five fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed  on man as to his submarine excursions.    I say seventy-five fathoms, though I had no instrument by which to  judge the distance.  But I knew that even in the clearest waters the  solar rays could not penetrate further.  And accordingly the darkness  deepened.  At ten paces not an object was visible.  I was groping my  way, when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light.  Captain Nemo had  just put his electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same,  and Conseil and I followed their example.  By turning a screw I  established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and  the sea, lit by our four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of  thirty-six yards.    As we walked I thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could not  fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch.  But if they did  approach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from the  hunters.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, put his gun to his  shoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on.  At last, after  about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end.  A wall of  superb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of gigantic  blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but  which presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island of  Crespo.  It was the earth!  Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  A gesture  of his brought us all to a halt; and, however desirous I might be to  scale the wall, I was obliged to stop.  Here ended Captain Nemo's  domains.  And he would not go beyond them.  Further on was a portion of  the globe he might not trample upon.    The return began.  Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his little  band, directing their course without hesitation.  I thought we were not  following the same road to return to the Nautilus.  The new road was  very steep, and consequently very painful.  We approached the surface  of the sea rapidly.  But this return to the upper strata was not so  sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might  have produced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on  internal lesions, so fatal to divers.  Very soon light reappeared and  grew, and, the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the  different objects with a spectral ring.  At ten yards and a half deep,  we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous  than the birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game  worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze, when at that moment I saw the  Captain shoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the  shrubs.  He fired; I heard a slight hissing, and a creature fell  stunned at some distance from us.  It was a magnificent sea-otter, an  enhydrus, the only exclusively marine quadruped.  This otter was five  feet long, and must have been very valuable.  Its skin, chestnut-brown  above and silvery underneath, would have made one of those beautiful  furs so sought after in the Russian and Chinese markets: the fineness  and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch L80.  I admired this  curious mammal, with its rounded head ornamented with short ears, its  round eyes, and white whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet  and nails, and tufted tail.  This precious animal, hunted and tracked  by fishermen, has now become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the  northern parts of the Pacific, or probably its race would soon become  extinct.    Captain Nemo's companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,  and we continued our journey.  For one hour a plain of sand lay  stretched before us.  Sometimes it rose to within two yards and some  inches of the surface of the water.  I then saw our image clearly  reflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical group  reflecting our movements and our actions; in a word, like us in every  point, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet  in the air.    Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which  formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these  "]]]
