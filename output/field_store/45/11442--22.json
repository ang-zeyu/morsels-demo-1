He has his  buildings and the property in them valued; and pays a certain rate per  cent. on such valuation. A fund is thus raised out of which any member  suffering loss by fire is paid the amount for which the property was  insured. When the fund is exhausted, it is again supplied by a tax  assessed upon the members in proportion to the amounts for which they  are respectively insured.          Chapter XXV.    The Militia.        Sec.1. It is the practice of governments to keep their respective countries  prepared to defend themselves against foreign enemies. For this purpose  all men liable to do military duty are enrolled, and are required to  meet on certain days every year for instruction in the art of war, in  order to be ready for actual service whenever it shall be required. The  body of soldiers thus enrolled are called the _militia_. There are other  words which are sometimes applied to bodies of soldiers; as _infantry_,  which means the soldiers or troops who serve on foot; _cavalry_, the  troops on horses; _artillery_, those who manage the cannon and other  heavy weapons of war. But all troops are comprehended in the general  term, _militia_.    Sec.2. The militia of a state, or a portion of them, may also be needed to  aid in executing the laws of the state, and in suppressing insurrection  or rebellion. An _insurrection_ is a rising against the public  authority, or the attempt of persons to prevent the execution of a law.  _Rebellion_ generally means nearly the same as _insurrection_; but more  properly it signifies a revolt, or an attempt to overthrow the  government to establish a different one. As it is the duty of an  executive to see the laws executed, power is given by the constitution  to the governor to call out a sufficient military force for this  purpose.    Sec.3. All able-bodied white male citizens of the United States, between  the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, are liable to perform  military service in the states in which they reside, except such as are  exempt by the laws of the states and of the United States. Persons  exempt by the laws of the states are generally the following: Ministers  of the gospel; commissioned officers of the militia having served a  certain number of years; members of uniformed companies having served  for a specified time; members of fire companies; certain public officers  while in office; and in some states teachers and students of colleges,  academies, and common schools; and a few others.    Sec.4. Persons exempt by the laws of the United States are the  vice-president, the subordinate executive and all the judicial officers  of the government of the United States; members of congress and its  officers; custom-house officers and their clerks; post-officers and  drivers of mail stages; ferrymen employed at ferries on post-roads;  pilots and mariners.    Sec.5. By the constitutions of the several states, the governors are made  the commanders-in-chief of the militia of their respective states; and  by the constitution of the United States, the president is made  commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and also  of the militia of the states when called out into actual service. It has  already been remarked, (Sec.2,) that the military force of the state is at  the command of the executive to protect the government and its citizens.  So the president was thought the proper person to have command of the  public forces, to execute the laws of the United States, to repel  invasion, and to carry on war. Hence the governors and the president are  not among the public officers who are exempt from military duty.    Sec.6. Persons who, having been duly notified, refuse to appear at  military parades, or, appearing without being equipped as the law  directs, are tried by a military court, called _court martial_,  consisting usually of three military officers, or of such other persons  as may be appointed according to the law of the state. If the persons  tried do not show good cause for their delinquency, they are fined in  such sums as the law prescribes. In certain cases courts may consist of  more than three members.    Sec.7. The highest militia officer, except the governor, is the  _adjutant-general_ of the state; who keeps a list of all the higher  commissioned officers, containing the dates of their commissions, their  rank, the corps (pronounced _core_) they belong to, the division,  brigade, and regiment, and their places of residence. He distributes all  orders from the commander-in-chief (the governor,) to the several  divisions; attends public reviews where the commander-in-chief reviews  the militia; and obeys all orders from him relative to carrying into  execution the system of military discipline established by law.    Sec.8. There is also in some states a _commissary-general_, who has the  care of the arsenals and magazines, and the articles deposited in them.  An _arsenal_ is a building in which are kept cannon, muskets, powder,  balls, and other warlike stores; all of which are to be kept in repair  and ready for use.    Sec.9. There are persons who, believing all wars to be wrong, can not  conscientiously do military service. As it is the object of our  government to secure to every person the liberty of conscience as well  as other rights, the constitutions of many of the states provide, that  those who are averse to bearing arms, may be excused by paying annually  a sum of money instead of rendering the service. But it may well be  doubted whether compelling a man to pay the money is not itself a  violation of the right of conscience. Many persons conceive it to be no  less morally wrong to commute for the service than to perform it. In  some states, all persons belonging to the society of Friends, usually  called Quakers, are exempt without the payment of an equivalent in  money.    Sec.10. In the states of New York and Ohio, the rank and file of the  militia are not required to train in time of peace. Persons liable to  perform military service, except those connected with the uniformed  companies, are enrolled in the militia; but instead of doing duty, they  pay annually a small tax, which is in New York fifty cents, and in Ohio  fifty cents, or a day's highway labor.    Sec.11. Laws abolishing trainings and musters of the great body of the  militia, are, it is believed, growing into favor, and for these among  other reasons: First, the militia system produces no material  improvement in discipline; secondly, the expenditure of time and money  in these useless exercises, and for arms and equipments, are burdensome  to many citizens; and thirdly, there is no probability of an occasion  requiring a large portion of the militia to be so suddenly called into  service as to allow no time for preparation. Volunteer companies like  those kept up and disciplined in the states above named, and the  standing army of the nation, are deemed sufficient for any supposable  emergency.    Sec.12. Happily the practice of settling disputes between nations by war,  is becoming less popular in civilized and Christian communities. War is  a dreadful evil, and ought to be discouraged, and, if possible, avoided.  Were governments so disposed, they might in most cases settle their  differences as individuals do, by submitting them to the judgment of a  third party. If the love of military honor were less encouraged, and the  principles of peace duly inculcated, the time would be hastened when  \"nations shall learn war no more.\"            Government of the United States.          Chapter XXVI.    Causes of the Revolution.        Sec.1. The plan of government in this country is peculiar. To a person  previously unacquainted with our political institutions, it might seem  strange, after having read the foregoing description of the state  governments, to be told that there is still another and a different  government to which the people are subject. How the people of more than  thirty states, all having complete and distinct governments, can at the  same time be subject to another government, also complete in all its  parts, he would not immediately understand. He would not know what is  meant by the government of the United States. How the states, all having  governments of their own, can be _united_ in one government, he would  not readily perceive.    Sec.2. We shall therefore proceed to a description of the government of the  United States, from which will appear the relation between that  government and the state governments. It will also appear that the state  governments, each of which has in itself a great deal of machinery, all  move in harmony with the great political machine--the government of the  United States. It is easy to see that a knowledge of these governments  is important to the people who live under them, as every freeman  exercises a part of the governing power, both in the government of his  own state, and in the general government.    Sec.3. To assist the reader in understanding the constitution and  government of the United States, we shall first give a sketch of the  governments which preceded, and of the principal causes which led to the  revolution in the government of this country. Most of the youth who are  of sufficient age to study this work, probably know that our present  forms of government were not established by the early settlers in this  country. The first inhabitants were _colonists_. A _colony_ is a  settlement of persons in a distant place or country, who remain subject  to the government of the state or country from which they removed. The  American colonies which have become the \"United States,\" were chiefly  settled from Great Britain, and were under her jurisdiction.    Sec.4. The political rights and privileges enjoyed by the colonists as  British subjects, were very limited, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#18)"],[1,"or because of some  other reason I know not, but I soon fell into a sound sleep from which  I did not awaken until the chambermaid knocked at the door at eight  o'clock. Neither did I experience any return of those terrifying  nightmares which had disturbed my slumbers earlier in the night.    My breakfast despatched, I smoked a pipe on the bench in the porch,  and Mr. Martin, who evidently had few visitors, became almost  communicative. Undesirable patrons, he gave me to understand, had done  his business much harm. By dint of growls and several winks he sought  to enlighten me respecting the identity of these tradekillers. But I  was no wiser on the point at the end of his exposition than I had been  at the beginning.    \"Things ain't right in these parts,\" he concluded, and thereupon  retired within doors.    Certainly, whatever the reason might be, the village even in broad  daylight retained that indefinable aspect of neglect, of loneliness.  Many of the cottages were of very early date--and many were empty. A  deserted mill stood at one end of the village street, having something  very mournful and depressing about it, with its black, motionless  wings outspread against the blue sky like those of a great bat  transfixed.    There were rich-looking meadows no great way from the village, but  these, I learned, formed part of the property of Farmer Hines, and  Farmer Hines was counted an inhabitant of the next parish. It was,  then, this particular country about Upper Crossleys over which the  cloud hung; and I wondered if the district had been one of  those--growing rare nowadays--which had flourished under the  protection of the \"big house\" and had decayed with the decay of the  latter. It had been a common enough happening in the old days, and I  felt disposed to adopt this explanation.    My brief survey completed, then, I returned to the Abbey Inn for my  stick and camera, and set out forthwith for Friar's Park.    From certain atmospherical indications which I had observed, I had  anticipated a return of the electrical storm which a few days before  had interrupted the extraordinary heat-wave. And now as I left the  village behind and came out on the dusty highroad a faint breeze  greeted me--and afar off I discerned a black cloud low down upon the  distant hills.          CHAPTER XIII    DR. DAMAR GREEFE      As the crow flies Friar's Park was less than two miles from the Abbey  Inn; but the road, which according to a sign-board led \"to  Hainingham,\" followed a tortuous course through the valley, and when  at last I came to what I assumed to be the gate-lodge, a thunderous  ebony cloud crested the hill-top above, and its edge, catching the  burning rays of the sun, glowed fiercely like the pall of Avalon in  the torchlight. Through the dense ranks of firs cloaking the slopes a  breeze presaging the coming storm whispered evilly, and here in the  hollow the birds were still.    I stared rather blankly at the ivy-covered lodge, which, if  appearances were to be trusted, was unoccupied. But I pushed open the  iron gate and tugged at a ring which was suspended from the wall. A  discordant clangor rewarded my efforts, the cracked note of a bell  which spoke from somewhere high up in the building, that seemed to be  buffeted to and fro from fir to fir, until it died away, mournfully,  in some place of shadows far up the slope.    In the voice of the bell there was something lonesome, something akin  to the atmosphere of desertion which seemed to lie upon the whole  neighborhood--something fearful, too, as though the bell would  whisper: \"Return! Beware of disturbing the dwellers in this place.\"    The house, one wing of which I have said was visible from the inn  window, could not be seen at all from the gate. Indeed I had lost  sight of it at the moment that I had set out and had never obtained a  glimpse of it since.    Ten minutes before, I had inquired the way from a farm-laborer whom I  had met on the road, and he had answered me with a curiosity but  thinly veiled. His directions had been characterized by that rustic  vagueness which assumes in the inquirer an intimate knowledge of local  landmarks. But nevertheless I believed I had come aright. I gathered  from its name that Friar's Park was in part at least a former monastic  building, and certainly the cracked bell spoke with the voice of  ancient monasteries, and had in it the hush of cloisters and the sigh  of renunciation.    Although I had mentioned nothing of the purpose of my journey to mine  host of the Abbey Inn or to any of his cronies--and these were few in  number--I had hoped to find Hawkins at the lodge; and a second time I  awoke the ghostly bell-voice. But nothing responded to its call; man,  bird and beast had seemingly deserted Friar's Park.    Faintly I detected the lowing of cattle in some distant pasture; the  ranks of firs whispered secretly one to another; and the pall above  the hills grew blacker and began to stretch out over the valley.    Amid this ominous stillness of nature I began to ascend the  cone-strewn path. Evidently enough the extensive grounds had been  neglected for years, and that few pedestrians and fewer vehicles ever  sought Friar's Park was demonstrated by the presence of luxurious  weeds in the carriage-way. Having proceeded for some distance, until  the sheer hillside seemed to loom over me like the wall of a tower, I  paused, peering about in the ever growing darkness. I was aware of a  physical chill; certainly no ray of sunlight ever penetrated to this  tunnel through the firs. Could I have mistaken the path and be  proceeding, not towards the house, but away from it, and into the  gloom of the woods? Or perhaps the deserted lodge was that of some  other, empty establishment.    There was something uncomfortable in this reflection; momentarily I  knew a childish fear of the dim groves. I thought of the \"darkness  'broidered with luminous eyes,\" and I walked forward rapidly,  self-assertively. Ten paces brought me to one of the many bends in the  winding road--and there, far ahead, as though out of some cavern in  the very hillside, a yellow light shone.    I pressed on with greater assurance, until the house became visible.  Now I perceived that I had indeed strayed from the carriage sweep in  some way, for the path that I was following terminated at the foot of  a short flight of moss-covered steps. I mounted the steps and found  myself at the bottom of a terrace. The main entrance was far to my  left and separated from the terrace by a neglected lawn. That portion  of the place was Hanoverian and ugly, whilst the wing nearest to me  was Tudor and picturesque. Excepting the yellow light shining out from  a window on the right of the porch, no illuminations were visible  about the house, although the brewing storm had already plunged the  hollow into premature night.    My conception of Friar's Park had been wide of the reality--and there  was no sign of occupancy about this strange-looking mansion, which  might have hidden forgotten for centuries in the horse-shoe of the  hills. The stillness of the place was of that sort which almost seems  to be palpable; that can be seen and felt. A humid chill arose  apparently from the terrace, with its stone pavings outlined in moss,  and crept up from the wilderness below and down from the fir woods  above.    I had crossed the terrace and the lawn, and now stood looking through  the open French window from which light had proceeded into a room that  evidently adjoined the hall. A great still darkness had come, and on a  littered table in this room a reading-lamp was burning.    The room was furnished as a library. Every available foot of wall  space was occupied by laden bookcases. The volumes were nearly all old  and many of them were in strange, evidently foreign, bindings. Items  of chemical apparatus and cases of specimens were visible also as well  as an amazing collection of Egyptian relics strewn about the place in  the utmost disorder.    At the table a man was seated, deep in study of a huge leather-bound  volume. He was strangely gaunt, and apparently very tall. His  clean-shaven face resembled that of Anubis, the hawk-headed god of  Ancient Egypt, and his hair, which was growing white, he wore long and  brushed back from his bony brow. His skin was of a dull, even yellow  color, and his long thin brown hands betrayed to me the fact that the  man was a Eurasian. The crunching of a piece of gravel under foot  revealed my presence. The man looked up swiftly.    I started. Those widely-opened black eyes were truly hawk-like in  their dark intensity of gaze, and the uncanny resemblance to Anubis  was heightened by them. More than ever convinced that I had made a  mistake:    \"Forgive me for so rudely disturbing you,\" I said, \"but I was under  the impression that this was Friar's Park, whereas I fear I have  trespassed.\"    The intense gaze never left my face for a moment, but:    \"There is no trespass,\" answered the man at the table, speaking in a  high harsh voice and with a marked but evasive accent. \"All visitors  are welcome--chance ones, or otherwise. But you have certainly lost  your way; this is the Bell House.\"    \"And am I far from Friar's Park?\"    \"No great distance. May I ask if Lady Coverly knew of your proposed  visit?\"    \"She did not,\" I said with surprise.    \"Then I fear your journey has been fruitless. She is an invalid and  can receive no one.\"    There was something peremptory and imperious in his manner which I  resented, and evidently perceiving this resentment:    \"I am Lady Coverly's medical adviser,\" added the Eurasian. \"Possibly I  can afford you some assistance. In any event I fear you will have to  accept my poor hospitality for the nonce. The alternative is a  drenching.\"    Even as he spoke, the hollow was illuminated by a blinding flash of  lightning, and indeed his last words were drowned in the thunder that "]]]
