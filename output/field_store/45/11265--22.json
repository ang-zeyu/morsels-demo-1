Earth, one time, put on a frolic mood,    Heaved the rocks and changed the mighty motion    Of the deep, strong currents of the ocean;    Moved the plain and shook the haughty wood,    Crushed the little fern in soft, moist clay,    Covered it and hid it safe away.    Oh, the long, long centuries since that day!    Oh, the changes! Oh, life's bitter cost!    Since the useless little fern was lost.      Useless? Lost? There came a thoughtful man    Searching Nature's secrets far and deep;    From a fissure in a rocky steep    He withdrew a stone o'er which there ran    Fairy pencilings, a quaint design,    Leafage, veining, fibers clear and fine,    And the fern's life lay in every line!

Charlotte  had taken time to consider. But now this glimpse of the Baroness into  Edward's heart changed what had been but a suggestion at once into a  settled determination; and the more rapidly she made up her mind about  it, the more she outwardly seemed to flatter Edward's wishes. Never was  there any one more self-possessed than this lady; and to have mastered  ourselves in extraordinary cases, disposes us to treat even a common  case with dissimulation--it makes us inclined, as we have had to do so  much violence to ourselves, to extend our control over others, and  hold ourselves in a degree compensated in what we outwardly gain for  what we inwardly have been obliged to sacrifice. To this feeling there  is often joined a kind of secret, spiteful pleasure in the blind,  unconscious ignorance with which the victim walks on into the snare. It  is not the immediately doing as we please which we enjoy, but the  thought of the surprise and exposure which is to follow. And thus was  the Baroness malicious enough to invite Edward to come with Charlotte  and pay her a visit at the grape-gathering; and, to his question whether  they might bring Ottilie with them, to frame an answer which, if he  pleased, he might interpret to his wishes.    Edward had already begun to pour out his delight at the beautiful  scenery, the broad river, the hills, the rocks, the vineyard, the old  castles, the water-parties, and the jubilee at the grape-gathering, the  wine-pressing, etc., in all of which, in the innocence of his heart, he  was only exuberating in the anticipation of the impression which these  scenes were to make on the fresh spirit of Ottilie. At this moment they  saw her approaching, and the Baroness said quickly to Edward that he had  better say nothing to her of this intended autumn expedition--things  which we set our hearts upon so long before so often failing to come to  pass. Edward gave his promise; but he obliged his companion to move more  quickly to meet her; and at last, when they came very close, he ran on  several steps in advance. A heartfelt happiness expressed itself in his  whole being. He kissed her hand as he pressed into it a nosegay of wild  flowers which he had gathered on his way.    The Baroness felt bitter in her heart at the sight of it. Even whilst  she was able to disapprove of what was really objectionable in this  affection, she could not bear to see what was sweet and beautiful in it  thrown away on such a poor paltry girl.    When they had collected again at the supper-table, an entirely different  temper was spread over the party. The Count, who had in the meantime  written his letter and dispatched a messenger with it, occupied himself  with the Captain, whom he had been drawing out more and more--spending  the whole evening at his side, talking of serious matters. The Baroness,  who sat on the Count's right, found but small amusement in this; nor did  Edward find any more. The latter, first because he was thirsty, and then  because he was excited, did not spare the wine, and attached himself  entirely to Ottilie, whom he had made sit by him. On the other side,  next to the Captain, sat Charlotte; for her it was hard, it was almost  impossible, to conceal the emotion under which she was suffering.    The Baroness had sufficient time to make her observations at leisure.  She perceived Charlotte's uneasiness, and occupied as she was with  Edward's passion for Ottilie, she easily satisfied herself that her  abstraction and distress were owing to her husband's behavior; and she  set herself to consider in what way she could best compass her ends.    Supper was over, and the party remained divided. The Count, whose object  was to probe the Captain to the bottom, had to try many turns before he  could arrive at what he wished with so quiet, so little vain, but so  exceedingly laconic a person. They walked up and down together on one  side of the saloon, while Edward, excited with wine and hope, was  laughing with Ottilie at a window, and Charlotte and the Baroness were  walking backward and forward, without speaking, on the other side. Their  being so silent, and their standing about in this uneasy, listless way,  had its effect at last in breaking up the rest of the party. The ladies  withdrew to their rooms, the gentlemen to the other wing of the castle;  and so this day appeared to be concluded.          CHAPTER XI      Edward went with the Count to his room. They continued talking, and he  was easily prevailed upon to stay a little time longer there. The Count  lost himself in old times, spoke eagerly of Charlotte's beauty, which,  as a critic, he dwelt upon with much warmth.    \"A pretty foot is a great gift of nature,\" he said. \"It is a grace which  never perishes. I observed it today, as she was walking. I should almost  have liked even to kiss her shoe, and repeat that somewhat barbarous but  significant practice of the Sarmatians, who know no better way of  showing reverence for any one they love or respect, than by using his  shoe to drink his health out of.\"    The point of the foot did not remain the only subject of praise between  two old acquaintances; they went from the person back upon old stories  and adventures, and came on the hindrances which at that time people had  thrown in the way of the lovers' meetings--what trouble they had taken,  what arts they had been obliged to devise, only to be able to tell each  other that they loved.    \"Do you remember,\" continued the Count, \"an adventure in which I most  unselfishly stood your friend when their High Mightinesses were on a  visit to your uncle, and were all together in that great, straggling  castle? The day went in festivities and glitter of all sorts; and a part  of the night at least in pleasant conversation.\"    \"And you, in the meantime, had observed the back-way which led to the  court ladies' quarter,\" said Edward, \"and so managed to effect an  interview for me with my beloved.\"    \"And she,\" replied the Count, \"thinking more of propriety than of my  enjoyment, had kept a frightful old duenna with her. So that, while you  two, between looks and words, got on extremely well together, my lot, in  the meanwhile, was far from pleasant.\"    \"It was only yesterday,\" answered Edward, \"when we heard that you were  coming, that I was talking over the story with my wife and describing  our adventure on returning. We missed the road, and got into the  entrance-hall from the garden. Knowing our way from thence as well as we  did, we supposed we could get along easily enough.    \"But you remember our surprise on opening the door. The floor was  covered over with mattresses on which the giants lay in rows stretched  out and sleeping. The single sentinel at his post looked wonderingly at  us; but we, in the cool way young men do things, strode quietly on over  the outstretched boots, without disturbing a single one of the snoring  children of Anak.\"    \"I had the strongest inclination to stumble,\" the Count said, \"that  there might be an alarm given. What a resurrection we should have  witnessed.\"    At this moment the castle clock struck twelve.    \"It is deep midnight,\" the Count added, laughing, \"and just the proper  time; I must ask you, my dear Edward, to show me a kindness. Do you  guide me tonight, as I guided you then. I promised the Baroness that I  would see her before going to bed. We have had no opportunity of any  private talk together the whole day. We have not seen each other for a  long time, and it is only natural that we should wish for a confidential  hour. If you will show me the way there, I will manage to get back  again; and in any case, there will be no boots for me to stumble over.\"    \"I shall be very glad to show you such a piece of hospitality,\" answered  Edward; \"only the three ladies are together in the same wing. Who knows  whether we shall not find them still with one another, or make some  other mistake, which may have a strange appearance?\"    \"Do not be afraid,\" said the Count; \"the Baroness expects me. She is  sure by this time to be in her own room, and alone.\"    \"Well, then, the thing is easy enough,\" Edward answered.    He took a candle, and lighted the Count down a private staircase leading  into a long gallery. At the end of this, he opened a small door. They  mounted a winding flight of stairs, which brought them out upon a narrow  landing-place; and then, putting the candle in the Count's hand, he  pointed to a tapestried door on the right, which opened readily at the  first trial, and admitted the Count, leaving Edward outside in the dark.    Another door on the left led into Charlotte's sleeping-room. He heard  her voice, and listened. She was speaking to her maid. \"Is Ottilie in  bed?\" she asked. \"No,\" was the answer; \"she is sitting writing in the  room below.\" \"You may light the night-lamp,\" said Charlotte; \"I shall  not want you any more. It is late. I can put out the candle, and do  whatever I may want else myself.\"    It was a delight to Edward to hear that Ottilie was writing still. She  is working for me, he thought triumphantly. Through the darkness, he  fancied he could see her sitting all alone at her desk. He thought he  would go to her, and see her; and how she would turn to receive him. He  felt a longing, which he could not resist, to be near her once more.  But, from where he was, there was no way to the apartments which she  occupied. He now found himself immediately at his wife'"]]]
