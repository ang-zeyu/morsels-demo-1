Eggs must be fresh, or  they will not heal well: it is better to separate the yelks from the  whites always, though it is a more troublesome process; but for some  things it is essential to do so: when they are to be mixed with milk,  let it cool after boiling, or the eggs will poach; and only set it on  the fire a few minutes, to take off the raw taste of the eggs, stirring  it all the time. Currants require washing in many waters to cleanse  them; they must be picked and well dried, or they will stick together.  Almonds should be put in hot water till the skins will slip off, which  is called blanching; they must always be pounded with rose or orange  flower water, to prevent their oiling. When cream is used, put it in  just before the mixture is ready; much beating will decompose it. Before  a pudding or cake is begun, every ingredient necessary for it must be  ready; when the process is retarded by neglecting to have them prepared,  the article is injured. The oven must be in a proper state, and the  paste in the dishes or moulds, ready for such things as require it.  Promptitude is necessary in all our actions, but never more so than when  engaged in making cakes and puddings. When only one or two eggs are to  be used, cooks generally think it needless to beat them--it is an error:  eggs injure every thing, unless they are made light before they are  used. Cloths for boiling puddings should be made of German sheeting; an  article less thick, will admit the water, and injure the pudding.           *       *       *       *       *    RICE MILK FOR A DESSERT.    Boil half a pint of rice in water till tender, pour off the water, and  add a pint of milk with two eggs beaten well, stirred into it; boil all  together two or three minutes; serve it up hot, and eat it with butter,  sugar, and nutmeg. It may be sweetened and cooled in moulds, turned out  in a deep dish, and surrounded with rich milk, with raspberry marmalade  stirred into it, and strained to keep back the seeds--or the milk may be  seasoned with wine and sugar.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE PUFF PASTE.    Sift a quart of flour, leave out a little for rolling the paste, make up  the remainder with cold water into a stiff paste, knead it well, and  roll it out several times; wash the salt from a pound of butter, divide  it into four parts, put one of them on the paste in little bits, fold it  up, and continue to roll it till the butter is well mixed; then put  another portion of butter, roll it in the same manner; do this till all  the butter is mingled with the paste; touch it very lightly with the  hands in making--bake it in a moderate oven, that will permit it to  rise, but will not make it brown. Good paste must look white, and as  light as a feather.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE MINCEMEAT FOR PIES.    Boil either calves or hogs' feet till perfectly tender, rub them through  a colander; when cold, pass them through again, and it will come out  like pearl barley; take one quart of this, one of chopped apples, the  same of currants, washed and picked, raisins stoned and cut, of good  brown sugar, suet nicely chopped, and cider, with a pint of brandy; add  a tea-spoonful of pounded mace, one of cloves and of nutmegs; mix all  these together intimately. When the pies are to be made, take out as  much of this mixture as may be necessary; to each quart of it, add a  tea-spoonful of pounded black pepper, and one of salt; this greatly  improves the flavour, and can be better mixed with a small portion than  with the whole mass. Cover the moulds with paste, put in a sufficiency  of mince-meat, cover the top with citron sliced thin, and lay on it a  lid garnished around with paste cut in fanciful shapes. They may be  eaten either hot or cold, but are best when hot.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE JELLY FROM FEET.    Boil four calfs' feet, that have been nicely cleaned, and the hoofs  taken off; when the feet are boiled to pieces, strain the liquor through  a colander, and when cold, take all the grease off, and put the jelly in  a skillet, leaving the dregs which will be at the bottom. There should  be from four feet, about two quarts of jelly: pour into it one quart of  white wine, the juice of six fresh lemons strained from the seeds, one  pound and a half of powdered loaf sugar, a little pounded cinnamon and  mace, and the rind thinly pared from two of the lemons; wash eight eggs  very clean, whip up the whites to a froth, crush the shells and put with  them, mix it with the jelly, set it on the fire, stir it occasionally  till the jelly is melted, but do not touch it afterwards. When it has  boiled till it looks quite clear on one side, and the dross accumulates  on the other, take off carefully the thickest part of the dross, and  pour the jelly in the bag; put back what runs through, until it becomes  quite transparent--then set a pitcher under the bag, and put a cover all  over to keep out the dust: the jelly looks much prettier when it is  broken to fill the glasses. The bag should be made of cotton or linen,  and be suspended in a frame made for the purpose. The feet of hogs make  the palest coloured jelly; those of sheep are a beautiful amber-colour,  when prepared.           *       *       *       *       *    A SWEETMEAT PUDDING.    Make a quart of flour into puff paste; when done, divide it into three  parts of unequal size; roll the largest out square and moderately thin,  spread over it a thin layer of marmalade, leaving a margin all round  about an inch broad; roll the next largest in the same manner, lay it  on, cover that with marmalade, leaving a margin; then roll the smallest,  and put it on the other two, spreading marmalade; fold it up, one fold  over the other, the width of your hand--press the ends together, tie it  in a cloth securely, and place it in a kettle of boiling water, where it  can lie at length without doubling; boil it quickly, and when done, pour  melted butter with sugar and wine in the dish.           *       *       *       *       *    TO MAKE AN ORANGE PUDDING.    Put two oranges and two lemons, into five quarts of water--boil them  till the rinds are quite tender; take them out, and when cold, slice  them thin, and pick out the seeds; put a pound of loaf sugar into a pint  of water--when it boils, slice into it twelve pippins pared and  cored--lay in the lemons and oranges, stew them tender, cover the dish  with puff paste, lay the fruit in carefully, in alternate layers--pour  on the syrup, put some slips of paste across, and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    AN APPLE CUSTARD.    Pare and core twelve pippins, slice them tolerably thick, put a pound of  loaf sugar in a stew pan, with a pint of water and twelve cloves: boil  and skim it, then put in the apples, and stew them till clear, and but  little of the syrup remains--lay them in a deep dish, and take out the  cloves; when the apples are cold, pour in a quart of rich boiled  custard--set it in water, and make it boil till the custard is set--take  care the water does not get into it.           *       *       *       *       *    BOILED LOAF.    Pour a quart of boiling milk over four little rolls of bread--cover them  up, turning them occasionally till saturated with the milk; tie them  very tight in cloths, and boil them an hour; lay them in the dish, and  pour a little melted butter over them; for sauce, have butter in a boat,  seasoned with wine, sugar, and grated nutmeg.           *       *       *       *       *    TRANSPARENT PUDDING.    Beat eight eggs very light, add half a pound of pounded sugar, the same  of fresh butter melted, and half a nutmeg grated; sit it on a stove, and  keep stirring till it is as thick as buttered eggs--put a puff paste in  a shallow dish, pour in the ingredients, and bake it half an hour in a  moderate oven; sift sugar over it, and serve it up hot.           *       *       *       *       *    FLUMMERY.    One measure of jelly, one of cream, and half a one of wine; boil it  fifteen minutes over a slow fire, stirring all the time; sweeten it, and  add a spoonful of orange flower or rose water; cool it in a mould, turn  it in a dish, and pour around it cream, seasoned in any way you like.           *       *       *       *       *    BURNT CUSTARD.    Boil a quart of milk--and when cold, mix with it the yelks of eight  eggs; stir them together over the fire a few minutes; sweeten it to your  taste, put some slices of savoy cake in the bottom of a deep dish, and  pour on the custard; whip the whites of the eggs to a strong froth, lay  it lightly on the top, sift some sugar over it, and hold a salamander  over it until it is a light brown; garnish the top with raspberry  marmalade, or any kind of preserved fruit.           *       *       *       *       *    AN ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING.    Beat eight eggs very light, add to them a pound of flour sifted, and a  pound of powdered sugar; when it looks quite light, put in a pound of  suet finely shred, a pint of milk, a nutmeg grated, and a gill of  brandy; mix with it a pound of currants, washed, picked, and dried, and  a pound of raisins stoned and floured--tie it in a thick cloth, and boil  it steadily eight hours.           *       *       *       *       *    MARROW PUDDING.    Grate a large loaf of bread, and pour on the crumbs a pint of rich milk  boiling hot; when cold, add four eggs, a pound of beef marrow sliced  thin, a gill of brandy, with sugar and nutmeg to your taste--mix all  well together, and either bake or boil it; when done, stick slices of  citron over the top.           *       *       *       *       *    SIPPET PUDDING.    Cut a loaf of bread as thin as possible, put a layer of it in the bottom  of a deep dish, strew on some slices of marrow or butter, with a handful  of currants or stoned raisins; do this till the dish is full;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#18)"],[1,"west.  Teembo, the capital of the Foolah king, is about 270 miles inland from the  entrance of the Rio Noonez. The paths for trade and communication with the  interior, from this position, are at the king's pleasure, and he opens and  shuts them by his mandate. The Foolahs are tall, well-limbed, robust and  courageous, grave in their deportment, are well acquainted with commerce,  and travel over an astonishing space of the country. Their religion is a  mixture of Mahomedanism, idolatry, and fetishism. One of their tenets,  which inculcates the destruction of those they term infidels, is peculiarly  friendly to slavery, and as the greater part of their neighbouring tribes  are of that description, they are continually practising every violence,  and, are frequently engaged in wars. When I suggested to a chief of very  considerable intelligence, and one of the Foolah king's head men, whom I  met in the Rio Pongo, the enormity of their injustice to the surrounding  tribes, and how displeasing it was to the God they prayed to, his reply  was, \"True, this be bad fashion to Foolah, or Mandingo man, but these  people we make war against never pray to God, nor do we make war with those  who give God Almighty service.\" While this barbarism exists, and the slave  trade is continued, humanity will have to, bewail the miserable condition  of the African slave. For this, and various other reasons that might be  urged, and considering the position and extensive influence of the Foolah  nation, their king claims a high consideration in a combined scheme of  establishment upon the coast.    So impressed was this chief, of the beneficial advantages to be derived  from agriculture, that he tendered land, cattle, men, &c. to the agents of  the Sierra Leone Company, only requesting from them, in return, a delegated  superintendance; but, strange to tell, this disposition was not cultivated  nor improved; nor was the further offer of the king of Laby, and his high  priest, to place their sons under the protection of the Company, to be sent  to England and educated. A more important step could not have been taken to  attain the object of the Directors, than this of attaching the Foolah  nation to their interest.    The women of this nation are handsome, and of a sprightly temper, and their  countenances are more regular than those of the common Negroes; the hair in  both men and women is much longer, and not so woolly, but they have a most  disgusting custom of forming it into ringlets, bedaubed with oil and  grease, which gives them a very barbarous appearance. The Foolah tongue, is  different from that of the surrounding nations, and its accent is more  harmonious.    To the southward of the Rio Pongo, to Sierra Leone, lie the countries of  the Bagoes, Soosees, Mandingos, Timminees, and Boolams, all idolaters  except the Mandingos, who, like the Foolahs, associate in their religion a  mixture of fetishism and Mahomedanism. The Timminees are a more harmless  race of men than any of the other _infidel_ nations, and their dispositions  are more calculated to industrious avocations than their neighbours.    I have already noticed the Mandingos, but, as I consider this nation and  the Foolahs of the first consequence, from their power and influence over  the other nations of this part of the coast, I shall add a few more  observations upon them.    From what I have before stated, it will appear that the Mandingos are a  numerous people in Africa, gaining a daily influence and authority in the  district now under consideration. Besides the tribes of this people who  inhabit the countries between the Soosees and Timminees, there are various  others established in the country of Bambouk, and on the borders of the  Gambia, but the great body occupy an extensive territory above the sources  of that river.    The empire of the Mandingos is not, however, so considerable as that of the  Foolahs, but from their increasing influence over the western countries,  from their docile and cunning dispositions, their knowledge in merchandize,  and acquirements in book-knowledge, their power must, in process of time,  be greatly increased; and it will be of the utmost moment to civilize them,  in order to acquire an influence over the more barbarous states.    Notwithstanding the cunning and dissimulation which characterizes these  people, they are generous, open, and hospitable, and their women are  aimiable and engaging: they are more zealous Mahomedans than the Foolahs;  their colour has a mixture of yellow, but their features are more regular  than the other nations of Africa which I have seen. The Foolahs, the  Mandingos, and the Joliffs, bordering on the Senegal, are the most handsome  Negroes on this part of Africa; the hair of the latter, however, is more  crisped and woolly, their nose is round, and their lips are thick; this  nation, in particular, is blacker than those approximating towards the  line; nor are the Negroes in the Krew coast, and towards Palmas, so black  as the nation I now speak of; which may tend to prove, that the colour of  the Africans does not arise from a vertical sun, but from other physical  causes yet unknown.    There is a characteristic feature between the Mahomedan nations of Africa,  particularly those from the shores of the Mediterranean (whom I have seen  in my travels in that quarter) which, with their almost universal  profession of the Mahomedan religion, sanctions the idea, that this part of  the coast has been peopled from the eastern parts of the continent; but the  visible difference in religion, complexion, and feature, of the nations  towards Cape Palmas, give rise to other conjectures. An obvious difference  may be observed among these numerous nations; their language and their  customs are various, and are frequently without affinity or relation. From  the shores of the Mediterranean to this part of Africa, the majority of the  nations are Mahomedans, but towards Cape Palmas they are gross idolaters,  with a mixture Mahomedanism and superstition; many of them erect temples,  and dedicate groves to the devil. I have seen several of these, which  exhibit no outward sign or object of worship, but consist of stumps of  trees, in a circular form, covered with leaves, or a thatched roof, in the  centre of which stands a square altar of mud, without any image of  adoration. The reason assigned by them for their  omission in this  instance, is, \"that they never look the Devil or evil spirit, therefore  they do not know how to make any thing like him.\" To the good spirit they  neither make offering nor sacrifice, considering it as unnecessary to  obtain his favours, from his disposition to do nothing but good, which of  course he will administer to them.    From every thing that I have observed, I conceive that idolatry, and fetish  worship, is the predominant religion of Africa, and that Mahomedanism has  been propagated by the Moore and Arab's. It may not here be unopportune to  introduce the Mandingo man's prayer, which I obtained from a very  intelligent  chief of that nation: viz.      _Mandingo Arabic_.    Subbohanalahe Rabila'ademy  abodehe. Subbohanala rabila  Allah. Subbohana arabe. Inye  allamante, nafuse wa amutate  sue wakefurella. Teyatelillahe  tebates allivatuelub lahey.  Sillamaleko ayo hanabehe, obara  katolahe Sullamalina Ihannabe,  lebadelahe Salihenee\"    The address to Mahomet follows,  viz.    Sahadala elahe idillaha  Mahomedo, arasoolo lahi  man Mahomedo aboodaho.    _In their idiom of English._    God lives and, is not dust.  God be master of all and is  above his slaves. God knows  his slave, and is not made of  earth; but above all. (Before  the next sentence, Subbohana  arabe, &c. he bows twice.)    Suppose I die, I can look you  to-morrow, and thank you, and  be out of trouble, and free from  the Devil.    (Teyatelillahe, &c. accompanied  by a motion of the fingers)    I beg in my prayers again,  God, I may die to day, I look to  thank you again to-morrow,  my people and family may  then get into trouble, and I  then pray to you.    To Mahomet.    Mahomet be man, born of  woman, the prophet of God,  and speak to him for man.      In this system of prayer there is a mixture of fetishism, Mahomedanism, and  a strong analogy to the Christian system; and it is no inconsiderable  argument in favour of the mediation of the Saviour, that in the worship of  heathen nations a mediator is uniformly associated with the object of  adoration. Virgil in his Aeneid, and other classic writers, illustrate a  belief of the ancient heathens in the omniscience of the deity, and they  clearly elucidate the importance they attached the mediatorial efficacy of  offerings and sacrifice.    The form of worship adapted to the foregoing prayer, is to squat down upon  the ground, placing the palm of their hands  flat thereon twice, touching  the earth the same number of times with their foreheads; then rubbing their  arms from the wrist to the elbow, with that which is contracted by this  operation, when the hands are applied to the face, and the forefingers put  into the ears.    I have dwelt more minutely upon this people and their present condition  compared with the Foolahs, because I consider these nations have it much in  their power to shut and open the  paths of intercourse with the interior  countries, therefore they become of importance, in the contemplation of any  pursuits upon this district of Africa.    The Mandingoes inhabiting Galam, and the countries interior to the Gambia,  carry on the principal trade with those of Bambouk, &c. where gold is  procured.  This precious metal is obtained from the surface of the earth,  and from the banks of  the falls of the rivers in the rainy season; it is  first washed in a calabash; and when the water is poured off, the dust, and  sometimes large grains remain. The natives have no idea of mining;  but it  appears from hence, that mines of this metal"]]]
