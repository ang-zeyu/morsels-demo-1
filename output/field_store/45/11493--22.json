He said, in justification of  the act, that his trust was now in God, and that the power which once,  with five loaves and two small fishes, fed abundantly three thousand  men, could easily make half a loaf suffice for them.    The loaf was accordingly divided, the beggar was supplied, and,  delighted with this unexpected relief, he went away. Alfred turned his  attention again to his reading. After a time the book dropped from his  hand. He had fallen asleep. He dreamed that a certain saint appeared  to him, and made a revelation to him from heaven. God, he said, had  heard his prayers, was satisfied with his penitence, and pitied his  sorrows; and that his act of charity in relieving the poor beggar,  even at the risk of leaving himself and his friends in utter  destitution, was extremely acceptable in the sight of Heaven. The  faith and trust which he thus manifested were about to be rewarded.  The time for a change had come. He was to be restored to his kingdom,  and raised to a new and higher state of prosperity and power than  before. As a token that this prediction was true, and would be all  fulfilled, the hunting party would return that night with an ample and  abundant supply.    Alfred awoke from his sleep with his mind filled with new hopes and  anticipations. The hunting party returned loaded with supplies, and in  a state of the greatest exhilaration at their success. They had fish  and game enough to have supplied a little army. The incident of  relieving the beggar, the dream, and their unwonted success confirming  it, inspired them all with confidence and hope. They began to  form plans for commencing offensive operations. They would build  fortifications to strengthen their position on the island. They would  collect a force. They would make sallies to attack the smaller parties  of the Danes. They would send agents and emissaries about the kingdom  to arouse, and encourage, and assemble such Saxon forces as were yet  to be found. In a word, they would commence a series of measures for  recovering the country from the possession of its pestilent enemy, and  for restoring the rightful sovereign to the throne. The development  of these projects and plans, and the measures for carrying them into  effect, were very much hastened by an event which suddenly occurred in  the neighborhood of Ethelney, the account of which, however, must be  postponed to the next chapter.    [Footnote 1: The name is spelled variously, Ethelney, AEthelney,  Ethelingay, &c. It was in Somersetshire, between the rivers Thone and  Parrot.]    [Footnote 2: As this incident has been so famous, it may amuse the  reader to peruse the different accounts which are given of it in the  most ancient records which now remain. They were written in Latin and  in Saxon, and, of course, as given here, they are translations. The  discrepancies which the reader will observe in the details illustrate  well the uncertainty which pertains to all historical accounts that go  back to so early an age.    \"He led an unquiet life there, at his cow-herd's. It happened that, on  a certain day, the rustic wife of the man prepared to bake her bread.  The king, sitting then near the hearth, was making ready his bow and  arrows, and other warlike implements, when the ill-tempered woman  beheld the loaves burning at the fire. She ran hastily and removed  them, scolding at the king, and exclaiming, 'You man! you will not  turn the bread you see burning, but you will be very glad to eat it  when it is done!' This unlucky woman little thought she was addressing  the King Alfred.\"    In a certain Saxon history the story is told thus:    \"He took shelter in a swain's house, and also him and his evil wife  diligently served. It happened that, on one day, the swain's wife  heated her oven, and the king sat by it warming himself by the fire.  She knew not then that he was the king. Then the evil woman was  excited, and spoke to the king with an angry mind. 'Turn thou these  loaves, that they burn not, for I see daily that thou art a great  eater!' He soon obeyed this evil woman because she would scold. He  then, the good king, with great anxiety and sighing, called to his  Lord, imploring his pity.\"    The following account is from a Latin life of St. Neot, which still  exists in manuscript, and is of great antiquity:    \"Alfred, a fugitive, and exiled from his people, came by chance and  entered the house of a poor herdsman, and there remained some days  concealed, poor and unknown.    \"It happened that, on the Sabbath day, the herdsman, as usual, led his  cattle to their accustomed pastures, and the king remained alone in  the cottage with the man's wife. She, as necessity required, placed a  few loaves, which some call _loudas_, on a pan, with fire underneath,  to be baked for her husband's repast and her own, on his return.    \"While she was necessarily busied, like peasants, on other offices,  she went anxious to the fire, and found the bread burning on the other  side. She immediately assailed the king with reproaches. 'Why, man! do  you sit thinking there, and are too proud to turn the bread? Whatever  be your family, with your manners and sloth, what trust can be put in  you hereafter? If you were even a nobleman, you will be glad to eat  the bread which you neglect to attend to.' The king, though stung by  her upbraidings, yet heard her with patience and mildness, and,  roused by her scolding, took care to bake her bread thereafter as she  wished.\"    There is one remaining account, which is as follows:    \"It happened that the herdsman one day, as usual, led his swine to  their accustomed pasture, and the king remained at home alone with the  wife. She placed her bread under the ashes of the fire to bake, and  was employed in other business when she saw the loaves burning, and  said to the king in her rage, 'You will not turn the bread you see  burning, though you will be very glad to eat it when done!' The king,  with a submitting countenance, though vexed at her upbraidings not  only turned the bread, but gave them to the woman well baked and  unbroken.\"    It is obvious, from the character of these several accounts that each  writer, taking the substantial fact as the groundwork of his story,  has added such details and chosen such expressions for the housewife's  reproaches as suited his own individual fancy. We find, unfortunately  for the truth and trustworthiness of history, that this is almost  always the case, when independent and original accounts of past  transactions, whether great or small, are compared. The gravest  historians, as well as the lightest story tellers, frame their  narrations for _effect_, and the tendency in all ages to shape and  fashion the narrative with a view to the particular effect designed  by the individual narrator to be produced has been found entirely  irresistible. It is necessary to compare, with great diligence and  careful scrutiny, a great many different accounts, in order to learn  how little there is to be exactly and confidently believed.]          CHAPTER IX.    REASSEMBLING OF THE ARMY.      Ethelney, though its precise locality can not now be certainly  ascertained, was in the southwestern part of England, in  Somersetshire, which county lies on the southern shore of the Bristol  Channel. There is a region of marshes in that vicinity, which  tradition assigns as the place of Alfred's retreat; and there was,  about the middle of this century, a farmhouse there, which bore the  name of Ethelney, though this name may have been given to it in modern  times by those who imagined it to be the ancient locality. A jewel of  gold, engraved as an amulet to be worn about the neck, and inscribed  with the Saxon words which mean \"Alfred had me made,\" was found in the  vicinity, and is still carefully preserved in a museum in England.  Some curious antiquarians profess to find the very hillock, rising out  of the low grounds around, where the herdsman that entertained Alfred  so long lived; but this, of course is all uncertain. The peculiarities  of the spot derived their character from the morasses and the woods,  and the courses of the sluggish streams in the neighborhood, and these  are elements of landscape scenery which ten centuries of time and of  cultivation would entirely change.    Whatever may have been the precise situation of the spot, instead of  being, as at first, a mere hiding-place and retreat, it became, before  many months, as was intimated in the last chapter, a military camp,  secluded and concealed, it is true, but still possessing, in a  considerable degree, the characteristics of a fastness and place of  defense. Alfred's company erected something which might be called a  wall. They built a bridge across the water where the herdsman's boat  had been accustomed to ply. They raised two towers to watch and guard  the bridge. All these defenses were indeed of a very rude and simple  construction; still, they answered the purpose intended. They afforded  a real protection; and, more than all, they produced a certain moral  effect upon the minds of those whom they shielded, by enabling them  to consider themselves as no longer lurking fugitives, dependent for  safety on simple concealment, but as a garrison, weak, it is true, but  still gathering strength, and advancing gradually toward a condition  which would enable them to make positive aggressions upon the enemy.    The circumstance which occurred to hasten the development of Alfred's  plans, and which was briefly alluded to at the close of the last  chapter, was the following: It seems that quite a large party of  Danes, under the command of a leader named Hubba, had been making a  tour of conquest and plunder in Wales, which country was on the other  side of the Bristol Channel, directly north of Ethelney, where Alfred  was beginning to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#18)"],[1,"Gandhara, was at least  encouraged by it.    But though coins and sculpture bring clearly before us a medley of  deities corresponding to a medley of human races, they do not help us  much in tracing the growth of thought, phases of which are preserved  in a literature sufficiently copious though the record sometimes fails  at the points of transition where it would be of most interest. It is  natural that sacred books should record accepted results rather than  tentative innovations and even disguise the latter. But we can fix a  few dates which enable us to judge what shape Buddhism was taking  about the time of the Christian era. The Tibetan historian Taranatha  is not of much help, for his chronology is most confused, but still he  definitely connects the appearance of Mahayanist texts with the reign  of Kanishka and the period immediately following it[178] and regards  them as a new phenomenon. Greater assistance is furnished by the  Chinese translators, whose dates are known with some exactitude. Thus  the earliest Buddhist work rendered into Chinese is said to be the  sutra of forty-two sections, translated by Kasyapa Matanga in 67 A.D.  It consists of extracts or resumes of the Buddha's teaching mostly  prefaced by the words \"The Buddha said,\" doubtless in imitation of the  Confucian Analects where the introductory formula \"The master said\"  plays a similar part. Its ideas and precepts are Hinayanist:[179] the  Arhat is held up as the ideal and in a remarkable passage[180] where  the degrees of sanctity are graded and compared no mention is made of  Bodhisattvas. This first translation was followed by a long series of  others, principally from the Sutra-Pitaka, for very little of the  Vinaya was translated before the fifth century. A great number of  Hinayanist sutras were translated before 300 A.D. but very few after  450. On the other hand portions of the sutra about Amida's Paradise,  of the Prajna-paramita, and of the Avatamsaka were translated about  150 A.D. and translations of the Lotus and Lalita-vistara appeared  about 300.    Great caution is necessary in using these data and the circumstances  of China as well as of India must be taken into account. If  translations of the Vinaya and complete collections of sutras are late  in appearing, it does not follow that the corresponding Indian texts  are late, for the need of the Vinaya was not felt until monasteries  began to spring up. Most of the translations made before the fifth  century are extracts and of indifferent workmanship. Some are retained  in the Chinese Tripitaka but are superseded by later versions. But  however inaccurate and incomplete these older translations may be, if  any of them can be identified with a part of an extant Sanskrit work  it follows that at least that part of the work and the doctrines  contained in it were current in India or Central Asia some time before  the translation was made. Applying this principle we may conclude that  the Hinayana and Mahayana were flourishing side by side in India and  Central Asia in the first century A.D. and that the Happy Land sutras  and portions of the Prajna-paramita already existed. From that time  onwards Mahayanist literature as represented by Chinese translations  steadily increases, and after 400 A.D. Hinayanist literature declines,  with two exceptions, the Vinaya and the Abhidharma books of the  Sarvastivadins. The Vinaya was evidently regarded as a rule of life  independent of theology, but it is remarkable that Hsuean Chuang after  his return from India in 645 should have thought it worth while to  translate the philosophy of the Sarvastivadins.    Other considerations render this chronology probable. Two conspicuous  features of the Mahayana are the worship of Bodhisattvas and idealist  philosophy. These are obviously parallel to the worship of Siva and  Vishnu, and to the rise of the Vedanta. Now the worship of these  deities was probably not prevalent before 300 B.C., for they are  almost unknown to the Pali Pitakas, and it was fully developed about  the time of the Bhagavad-gita which perhaps assumed its present form a  little before the Christian era. Not only is the combination of  devotion and metaphysics found in this work similar to the tone of  many Mahayanist sutras but the manifestation of Krishna in his divine  form is like the transformation scenes of the Lotus.[181] The chief  moral principle of the Bhagavad-gita is substantially the same as that  prescribed for Bodhisattvas. It teaches that action is superior to  inaction, but that action should be wholly disinterested and not  directed to any selfish object. This is precisely the attitude of the  Bodhisattva who avoids the inaction of those who are engrossed in  self-culture as much as the pursuit of wealth or pleasure. Both the  Gita and Mahayanist treatises lay stress on faith. He who thinks on  Krishna when dying goes to Krishna[182] just as he who thinks on  Amitabha goes to the Happy Land and the idea is not unknown to the  Pali texts, for it finds complete expression in the story of  Matthakundali.[183]    The idea of a benevolent deity to be worshipped with devotion and  faith and not with ceremonies is strange to old Buddhism and old  Brahmanism alike. It was a popular idea which became so strong that  neither priests nor Bhikshus could ignore it and in its ultimate  result it is hard to say whether Buddhist or Brahmanic elements are  more prominent. Both Avalokita and Krishna are Devas. The former has  the beauty of holiness and the strength which it gives, but also the  weakness of a somewhat abstract figure: the latter is very personal  and springs from the heart of India but to those who are not Hindus  seems wanting in purity and simplicity. The divine character of both  figures is due to Brahmanism rather than Buddhism, but the new form of  worship which laid stress on a frame of mind rather than on ceremonial  and the idea of Avataras or the periodic appearance of superhuman  saviours and teachers indicate the influence of Buddhism on  Brahmanism.    There is a similar parallel between the newer Buddhist philosophy and  the Vedantist school represented by Sankara, and Indian critics  detected it. Sankara was called a Pracchanna-bauddha or  crypto-buddhist by his theological opponents[184] and the resemblance  between the two systems in thought, if not in word, is striking. Both  distinguish relative and absolute truth: for both the relative truth  is practically theism, for both absolute truth is beyond description  and whether it is called Brahman, Dharma-kaya or Sunyata is not  equivalent to God in the Christian or Mohammedan sense. Just as for  the Vedantist there exist in the light of the highest knowledge  neither a personal God nor an individual soul, so the Madhyamika Sutra  can declare that the Buddha does not really exist. The Mahayanist  philosophers do not use the word Maya but they state the same theory  in a more subjective form by ascribing the appearance of the  phenomenal world to ignorance, a nomenclature which is derived from  the Buddha's phrase, \"From ignorance come the Sankharas.\"    Here, as elsewhere, Buddhist and Brahmanic ideas acted and reacted in  such complex interrelations that it is hard to say which has borrowed  from the other. As to dates, the older Upanishads which contain the  foundations but not the complete edifice of Vedantism, seem a little  earlier than the Buddha. Now we know that within the Vedantist school  there were divergences of opinion which later received classic  expression in the hands of Sankara and Ramanuja. The latter rejected  the doctrines of Maya and of the difference between relative and  absolute truth. The germs of both schools are to be found in the  Upanishads but it seems probable that the ideas of Sankara were  originally worked out among Buddhists rather than among Brahmans and  were rightly described by their opponents as disguised Buddhism. As  early as 520 A.D. Bodhidharma preached in China a doctrine which is  practically the same as the Advaita.    The earliest known work in which the theory of Maya and the Advaita  philosophy are clearly formulated is the metrical treatise known as  the Karika of Gaudapada. This name was borne by the teacher of  Sankara's teacher, who must have lived about 700 A.D., but the high  position accorded to the work, which is usually printed with the  Mandukya Upanishad and is practically regarded as[185] a part of it,  make an earlier date probable. Both in language and thought it bears a  striking resemblance to Buddhist writings of the Madhyamika school and  also contains many ideas and similes which reappear in the works of  Sankara.[186] On the other hand the Lankavatara Sutra which was  translated into Chinese in 513 and therefore can hardly have been  composed later than 450, is conscious that its doctrines resemble  Brahmanic philosophy, for an interlocutor objects that the language  used in it by the Buddha about the Tathagatagarbha is very like the  Brahmanic doctrine of the Atman. To which the Buddha replies that his  language is a concession to those who cannot stomach the doctrine of  the negation of reality in all its austerity. Some of the best known  verses of Gaudapada compare the world of appearance to the apparent  circle of fire produced by whirling a lighted torch. This striking  image occurs first in the Maitrayana Upanishad (VI. 24), which shows  other indications of an acquaintance with Buddhism, and also in the  Lankavatara Sutra.    A real affinity unites the doctrine of Sankara to the teaching of  Gotama himself. That teaching as presented in the Pali Pitakas is  marked by its negative and deliberately circumscribed character. Its  rule is silence when strict accuracy of expression is impossible,  whereas later philosophy does not shrink from phrases which are  suggestive, if not exact. Gotama refuses to admit that the human soul  is a fixed entity or Atman,"]]]
