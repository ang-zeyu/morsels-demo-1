The teams took their places; a hush fell on the crowd; the  referee's whistle sounded; the ball went up. Washington's center knocked  it toward her basket; Sahwah, darting out from under the basket, caught  it, sent it flying back to center; center threw it to the other  Washington forward; Sahwah jumped directly behind Marie Lanning,  received the ball from the other forward and shot the basket. Time, one  minute from the sending up of the ball. The Washington team machine was  working splendidly. A deafening roar greeted the first score. Marie bit  her lip angrily. She had vowed to keep Washington from scoring. But  Sahwah had not watched Marie play for nothing. She saw that she put up a  wonderful guard when confronting her girl, but she was not always quick  in turning around. Sahwah's plan of action was to keep away from her as  much as possible and to get hold of the ball when she was behind Marie's  back and throw for the basket before Marie could turn around. Guarding  is only effective when you have some one to guard and Marie discovered  she was really playing a game of tag with Sahwah, who was continually  running away from her. With the wonderful team work which the Washington  team had developed and their perfect understanding of each other's  movements, Sahwah could get widely separated from Marie and be sure to  receive the ball at just the right moment to throw a basket. Twice she  made it; three times; four times. Pandemonium reigned. \"Guard her,  Marie!\" shrieked the Mechanicals.    The score stood 8 to in favor of Washington at the end of the first five  minutes. Marie was white with rage. Was this a girl she was trying to  guard, or was it an eel? She would get her cornered with the ball,  Sahwah would measure Marie's height with her eye, locate the basket with  a brief glance, stiffen her muscles for a jump, and then as Marie stood  ready to beat down the ball, as it rose in the air, Sahwah would  suddenly relax, twist into some inconceivable position, shoot the ball  low to center and be a dozen feet away before Marie could get her hands  down from the air.      \"B-R-E,    DOUBLE-U, S,    T-E-R,    BREWSTER!\"    sang the Washington rooters in ecstasy. It was maddening. There was no  hope of keeping her from scoring. The time came when Sahwah and Marie  both had their hands on the ball at the same time and it called for a  toss-up. As the ball rose in the air Marie struck out as if to send it  flying to center, but instead of that, her hand, clenched, with a heavy  ring on one finger, struck Sahwah full on the nose. It was purely  accidental, as every one could see. Sahwah staggered back dizzily,  seeing stars. Her nose began to bleed furiously. She was taken from the  game and her substitute put in. A groan went up from the Washington  students as she was led out, followed by a suppressed cheer from the  Carnegie Mechanics. Marie met Joe's eye with a triumphant gleam in her  own.    Sahwah was beside herself at the thing which had happened to her. The  game and the championship were lost to Washington. The hope of the team  was gone. The girl who took her place was far inferior, both in skill in  throwing the ball and in tactics. She could not make a single basket.  The score rolled up on the Mechanicals' side; now it was tied. Sahwah,  trying to stanch the blood that flowed in a steady stream, heard the  roar that followed the tying of the score and ground her teeth in  misery. The Mechanicals were scoring steadily now. The first half ended  12 to 8 in their favor. But if Marie had expected to be the heroine of  the game now that Sahwah was out of it she was disappointed. The girl  who had taken Sahwah's place required no skilful guarding; she would not  have made any baskets anyhow, and there was no chance for a brilliant  display of Marie's powers. Marie stood still on the floor after the  first half ended, listening to the cheers and expecting her name to be  shouted above the rest, but nothing like that happened. The yells were  for the team in general, while the Washingtons, loyal to Sahwah to the  last, cheered her to the echo.    The noise penetrated to the dressing room where she lay on a mat:      \"Ach du lieber lieber,    Ach du lieber lieber,    BREWSTER! No, ja, bum bum!    Ach du lieber lieber,    Ach du lieber lieber,    BREWSTER! No, ja!\"    Sahwah raised her head. Another cheer rent the air:      \"B-R-E,    DOUBLE-U, S,    T-E-R,    BREWSTER!\"    Sahwah sat up.    \"BREWSTER! BREWSTER! WE WANT BREWSTER!\" thundered the gallery. Sahwah  sprang to her feet. Like a knight of old, who, expiring on the  battlefield, heard the voice of his lady love and recovered  miraculously, Sahwah regained her strength with a rush when she heard  the voice of her beloved school calling her.    When the teams came out for the second half Sahwah came out with them.  The gallery rocked with the joy of the Washingtonians. The whistle  sounded; the ball went up; the machine was in working order again.  Washington was jubilant; Carnegie Mechanics was equally confident now  that it was in the lead. Sahwah played like a whirlwind. She shot the  ball into the basket right through Marie's hands. Once! Twice! The score  was again tied. \"12 to 12,\" shouted the scorekeeper through her  megaphone. Like the roar of the waves of the sea rose the yell of the  Washingtonians:      \"Who tied the score when the score was rolling?    Who tied the score when the score was rolling?    Brewster, yes?    Well, I guess!    _She_ tied the score when the score was rolling!\"    Then Sahwah's luck turned and she could make no more baskets. She began  to feel weak again and fumbled the ball more than once. Marie laughed  sneeringly when Sahwah failed to score on a foul. The game was drawing  to a close. \"Two more minutes to play!\" called the referee. The ball was  under the Mechanicals' basket. The Washington guards got possession of  it and passed it forward to Sahwah, who threw for the basket and missed.  The ball came down right in the hands of Marie. The Mechanicals were  excellently placed to pass it by several stages down to their basket.  Instead of throwing it to center, however, she tried to make a  grandstand play and threw it the entire length of the gymnasium to the  waiting forward. It fell short and there was a wild scramble to secure  it. Washington got it. \"One minute to play!\" called the referee. A score  must be made now by one side or the other or the game would end in a  tie. The Washington guard located Sahwah. The Mechanicals closed in  around her so that she could not get away by herself. Marie towered over  her triumphantly. At last had come the chance to use her famous method  of guarding. The crowd in the gallery leaned forward, tense and silent.  The Mechanicals' forwards ran back under their basket to be in position  to throw the ball in when Marie should send it down to them. The  Washington guard threw the ball toward the massed group in the center of  the floor. As a tiger leaps to its prey, Sahwah, with a mighty spring,  jumped high in the air and caught the ball over the heads of the  blocking guards. Before the Mechanicals had recovered from their  surprise she sent it whirling toward the distant basket. It rolled  around the rim, hesitated for one breathless instant and then dropped  neatly through the netting. It was a record throw from the field.    \"Time's up,\" called the referee.    \"Score, 14 to 12 in favor of Washington High,\" shouted the scorekeeper.    The pent-up emotions of the Washington rooters found vent in a prolonged  cheer; then the crowd surged across the floor and surrounded Sahwah, and  she was borne in triumph from the gymnasium.    Joe Lanning and his cousin Marie, avoiding the merry throng, left the  building with long faces and never a word to say.          CHAPTER IX.      THE THESSALONIAN PLAY.    It was the custom each year for the Thessalonians, the Boys' Literary  Society of Washington High School, to give a play in the school  auditorium. This year the play was to be a translation of Briand's  four-act drama, \"Marie Latour.\" After a careful consideration of the  talents of their various girl friends, Gladys was asked to play the  leading role and Sahwah was also given a part in the cast. It was the  play where the unfortunate Marie Latour, pursued by enemies, hides her  child in a hollow statue of Joan of Arc. In order to produce the piece a  large statue of the Maid of Orleans was made to order. It was  constructed of some inexpensive composition and painted to look like  bronze. In the one scene a halo appears around the head of the Maid  while she is sheltering the child. This effect was produced by a circle  of tiny lights worked by a storage battery inside the statue. For the  sake of convenience in installing the electric apparatus and the wiring,  one half of the skirt--it was the statue representing Joan in woman's  clothes, not the one in armor--was made in the form of a door, which  opened on hinges. The base of the statue was of wood. It was not  finished until the day before the play and was used for the first time  at the dress rehearsal, when it was left standing on the stage.    Joe Lanning was in rather a dark mood these days. In the first place, he  had lost his winter's allowance of pocket money by staking it on the  Washington-Carnegie Mechanics game. After this he was treated coolly by  a large number of his classmates, and, not knowing that the story of his  treachery was being privately circulated around the school, he could not  guess the reason. The keenest desire of his life was to be made a member  of the Thessalonian Literary Society, and if he had kept his record  unsmirched he would have been taken in at the February election. He  confidently expected to be elected, and was already planning in his mind  the things he would do and say at the meetings, and what girls he would  take to the Thessalonian dances. He received a rude "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11734"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 460, October 25, 1884 (#18)"],[1,"Londoners  what fire could do if their metropolis were built on the New York plan. The  City, however, as we have remarked, is an exceptional part of London, and,  taking the British metropolis as it is, with its hundreds of square miles  of suburbs, and contrasting its condition with that of New York, we are led  to adopt the opinion that London, with its excellent fire brigade, is safe  from a destructive conflagration. It was stated above, and it is repeated  here, that the fire brigade of New York is unsurpassed for promptness,  skill, and heroic intrepidity, but their task, by contrast, is a heavy one  in a city like New York, with its numerous wooden buildings, wooden or  asphalt roofs, buildings from four to ten stories high, with long unbraced  walls, weakened by many large windows, containing more than ten times the  timber an average London house does, and that very inflammable, owing to  the dry and hot American climate. But this is not all. In New York we find  the five and six story tenement houses with two or three families on each  floor, each with their private ash barrel or box kept handy in their rooms,  all striving to keep warm during the severe winters of North America. We  also find narrow streets and high buildings, with nothing to arrest the  extension of a fire except a few small parks, not even projecting or  effectual fire-walls between the several buildings. And to all this must be  added the perfect freedom with which the city authorities of New York allow  in its most populous portions large stables, timber yards, carpenters'  shops, and the manufacture and storage of inflammable materials. Personal  liberty could not be carried to a more dangerous extent. We ought to be  thankful that in such matters individual freedom is somewhat hampered in  our old-fashioned and quieter-going country.--_London Morning Post_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE LATEST KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GAPES.      The gape worm may be termed the _bete noir_ of the poultry-keeper--his  greatest enemy--whether he be farmer or fancier. It is true there are some  who declare that it is unknown in their poultry-yards--that they have never  been troubled with it at all. These are apt to lay it down, as I saw a  correspondent did in a recent number of the _Country Gentleman_, that the  cause is want of cleanliness or neglect in some way. But I can vouch that  that is not so. I have been in yards where everything was first-rate, where  the cleanliness was almost painfully complete, where no fault in the way of  neglect could be found, and yet the gapes were there; and on the other  hand, I have known places where every condition seemed favorable to the  development of such a disease, and there it was absent--this not in  isolated cases, but in many. No, we must look elsewhere for the cause.    Observations lead me to the belief that gapes are more than usually  troublesome during a wet spring or summer following a mild winter. This  would tend to show that the egg from which the worm (that is in itself the  disease) emerges is communicated from the ground, from the food eaten, or  the water drunk, in the first instance, but it is more than possible that  the insects themselves may pass from one fowl to another. All this we can  accept as a settled fact, and also any description of the way in which the  parasitic worms attach themselves to the throats of the birds, and cause  the peculiar gaping of the mouth which gives the name to the disease.    Many remedies have been suggested, and my object now is to communicate some  of the later ones--thus to give a variety of methods, so that in case of  the failure of one, another will be at hand ready to be tried. It is a  mistake always to pin the faith to one remedy, for the varying conditions  found in fowls compel a different treatment. The old plan of dislodging the  worms with a feather is well known, and need not be described again. But I  may mention that in this country some have found the use of an ointment,  first suggested by Mr. Lewis Wright, I believe, most valuable. This is made  of mercurial ointment, two parts; pure lard, two parts; flour of sulphur,  one part; crude petroleum, one part--and when mixed together is applied to  the heads of the chicks as soon as they are dry after hatching. Many have  testified that they have never found this to fail as a preventive, and if  the success is to be attributed to the ointment, it would seem as if the  insects are driven off by its presence, for the application to the heads  merely would not kill the eggs.    Some time ago Lord Walsingham offered, through the Entomological Society of  London, a prize for the best life history of the gapes disease, and this  has been won by the eminent French scientist M. Pierre Megnin, whose essay  has been published by the noble donor. His offer was in the interest of  pheasant breeders, but the benefit is not confined to that variety of game  alone, for it is equally applicable to all gallinaceous birds troubled with  this disease. The pamphlet in question is a very valuable work, and gives  very clearly the methods by which the parasite develops. But for our  purpose it will be sufficient to narrate what M. Megnin recommends for the  cure of it. These are various, as will be seen, and comprise the experience  of other inquirers as well as himself.    He states that Montague obtained great success by a combination of the  following methods: Removal from infested runs; a thorough change of food,  hemp seed and green vegetables figuring largely in the diet; and for  drinking, instead of plain water, an infusion of rue and garlic. And Megnin  himself mentions an instance of the value of garlic. In the years 1877 and  1878, the pheasant preserves of Fontainebleau were ravaged by gapes. The  disease was there arrested and totally cured, when a mixture, consisting of  yolks of eggs, boiled bullock's heart, stale bread crumbs, and leaves of  nettle, well mixed and pounded together with garlic, was given, in the  proportion of one clove to ten young pheasants. The birds were found to be  very fond of this mixture, but great care was taken to see that the  drinking vessels were properly cleaned out and refilled with clean, pure  water twice a day. This treatment has met with the same success in other  places, and if any of your readers are troubled with gapes and will try it,  I shall be pleased to see the results narrated in the columns of the  _Country Gentleman_. Garlic in this case is undoubtedly the active  ingredient, and as it is volatile, when taken into the stomach the breath  is charged with it, and in this way (for garlic is a powerful vermifuge)  the worms are destroyed.    Another remedy recommended by M. Megnin was the strong smelling vermifuge  assafoetida, known sometimes by the suggestive name of \"devil's dung.\" It  has one of the most disgusting oders possible, and is not very pleasant to  be near. The assafoetida was mixed with an equal part of powdered yellow  gentian, and this was given to the extent of about 8 grains a day in the  food. As an assistance to the treatment, with the object of killing any  embryos in the drinking water, fifteen grains of salicylate of soda was  mixed with a pint and three-quarters of water. So successful was this, that  on M. De Rothschild's preserves at Rambouillet, where a few days before  gapes were so virulent that 1,200 pheasants were found dead every morning,  it succeeded in stopping the epidemic in a few days. But to complete the  matter, M. Megnin adds that it is always advisable to disinfect the soil of  preserves. For this purpose, the best means of destroying any eggs or  embryos it may contain is to water the ground with a solution of sulphuric  acid, in the proportion of a pennyweight to three pints of water, and also  birds that die of the disease should be deeply buried in lime.    Fumigation with carbolic acid is an undoubted cure, but then it is a  dangerous one, and unless very great care is taken in killing the worms,  the bird is killed also. Thus many find this a risky method, and prefer  some other. Lime is found to be a valuable remedy. In some districts of  England, where lime-kilns abound, it is a common thing to take children  troubled with whooping-cough there. Standing in the smoke arising from the  kilns, they are compelled to breathe it. This dislodges the phlegm in the  throat, and they are enabled to get rid of it. Except near lime-kilns, this  cannot be done to chickens, but fine slaked lime can be used, either alone  or mixed with powdered sulphur, two parts of the former to one of the  latter. The air is charged with this fine powder, and the birds, breathing  it, cough, and thus get rid of the worms, which are stupefied by the lime,  and do not retain so firm a hold on the throat. An apparatus has recently  been introduced to spread this lime powder. It is in the form of an  air-fan, with a pointed nozzle, which is put just within the coop at night,  when the birds are all within. The powder is already in a compartment made  for it, and by the turning of a handle, it is driven through the nozzle,  and the air within the coop charged with it. There is no waste of powder,  nor any fear that it will not be properly distributed. Experienced pheasant  and poultry breeders state that by the use of this once a week, gapes are  effectually prevented. In this case, also, I shall be glad to learn the  result if tried.
