The outlook of alchemy on the world outside human beings was  essentially anthropomorphic. In the image of man, the alchemist  created his universe.    In the times when alchemy was dominant, the divine scheme of creation,  and the place given to man in that scheme, were supposed to be  thoroughly understood. Everything had its place, designed for it from  the beginning, and in that place it remained unless it were forced  from it by violent means. A great part of the business of experimental  alchemy was to discover the natural position, or condition, of each  substance; and the discovery was to be made by interpreting the facts  brought to light by observation and experiment by the aid of  hypotheses deduced from the general scheme of things which had been  formed independently of observation or experiment. Alchemy was a part  of magic; for magic interprets and corrects the knowledge gained by  the senses by the touchstone of generalisations which have been  supplied, partly by the emotions, and partly by extra-human authority,  and accepted as necessarily true.    The conception of natural order which regulates the life of the savage  is closely related to that which guided the alchemists. The essential  features of both are the notion that everything is alive, and the  persuasion that things can be radically acted on only by using life as  a factor. There is also an intimate connexion between alchemy and  witchcraft. Witches were people who were supposed to make an unlawful  use of the powers of life; alchemists were often thought to pass  beyond what is permitted to the creature, and to encroach on the  prerogative of the Creator.    The long duration of alchemy shows that it appealed to some  deep-seated want of human beings. Was not that want the necessity for  the realisation of order in the universe? Men were unwilling to wait  until patient examination of the facts of their own nature, and the  facts of nature outside themselves, might lead them to the realisation  of the interdependence of all things. They found it easier to evolve a  scheme of things from a superficial glance at themselves and their  surroundings; naturally they adopted the easier plan. Alchemy was a  part of the plan of nature produced by this method. The extraordinary  dominancy of such a scheme is testified to by the continued belief in  alchemy, although the one experiment, which seems to us to be the  crucial experiment of the system, was never accomplished. But it is  also to be remembered that the alchemists were acquainted with, and  practised, many processes which we should now describe as operations  of manufacturing and technical chemistry; and the practical usefulness  of these processes bore testimony, of the kind which convinces the  plain man, to the justness of their theories.    I have always regarded two facts as most interesting and instructive:  that the doctrine of the essential unity of all things, and the  simplicity of natural order, was accepted for centuries by many, I  think one may say, by most men, as undoubtedly a true presentation of  the divine scheme of things; and, secondly, that in more recent times  people were quite as certain of the necessary truth of the doctrine,  the exact opposite of the alchemical, that the Creator had divided his  creation into portions each of which was independent of all the  others. Both of these schemes were formed by the same method, by  introspection preceding observation; both were overthrown by the same  method, by observation and experiment proceeding hand in hand with  reasoning. In each case, the humility of science vanquished the  conceit of ignorance.    The change from alchemy to chemistry is an admirable example of the  change from a theory formed by looking inwards, and then projected on  to external facts, to a theory formed by studying facts, and then  thinking about them. This change proceeded slowly; it is not possible  to name a time when it may be said, here alchemy finishes and  chemistry begins. To adapt a saying of one of the alchemists, quoted  in a former chapter; alchemy would not easily give up its nature, and  fought for its life; but an agent was found strong enough to overcome  and kill it, and then that agent also had the power to change the  lifeless remains into a new and pure body. The agent was the accurate  and imaginative investigation of facts.    The first great step taken in the path which led from alchemy to  chemistry was the substitution of one Principle, the Principle of  Phlogiston, for the three Principles of salt, sulphur, and mercury.  This step was taken by concentrating attention and investigation, by  replacing the superficial examination of many diverse phenomena by the  more searching study of one class of occurrences. That the field of  study should be widened, it was necessary that it should first be  narrowed.    Lead, tin, iron, or copper is calcined. The prominent and striking  feature of these events is the disappearance of the metal, and the  formation of something very unlike it. But the original metal is  restored by a second process, which is like the first because it also  is a calcination, but seems to differ from the first operation in that  the burnt metal is calcined with another substance, with grains of  wheat or powdered charcoal. Led thereto by their theory that  destruction must precede re-vivification, death must come before  resurrection, the alchemists confined their attention to one feature  common to all calcinations of metals, and gave a superficial  description of these occurrences by classing them together as  processes of mortification. Sulphur, wood, wax, oil, and many other  things are easily burned: the alchemists said, these things also  undergo mortification, they too are killed; but, as \"man can restore  that which man has destroyed,\" it must be possible to restore to life  the thing which has been mortified. The burnt sulphur, wood, wax, or  oil, is not really dead, the alchemists argued; to use the allegory of  Paracelsus, they are like young lions which are born dead, and are  brought to life by the roaring of their parents: if we make a  sufficiently loud noise, if we use the proper means, we shall bring  life into what seems to be dead material. As it is the roaring of the  parents of the young lions which alone can cause the still-born cubs  to live, so it is only by the spiritual agency of life, proceeded the  alchemical argument, that life can be brought into the mortified  sulphur, wood, wax, and oil.    The alchemical explanation was superficial, theoretical, in the wrong  meaning of that word, and unworkable. It was superficial because it  overlooked the fact that the primary calcination, the mortification,  of the metals, and the other substances, was effected in the air, that  is to say, in contact with something different from the thing which  was calcined; the explanation was of the kind which people call  theoretical, when they wish to condemn an explanation and put it out  of court, because it was merely a re-statement of the facts in the  language of a theory which had not been deduced from the facts  themselves, or from facts like those to be explained, but from what  were supposed to be facts without proper investigation, and, if facts,  were of a totally different kind from those to which the explanation  applied; and lastly, the explanation was unworkable, because it  suggested no method whereby its accuracy could be tested, no definite  line of investigation which might be pursued.    That great naturalist, the Honourable Robert Boyle (born in 1626, died  in 1691), very perseveringly besought those who examined processes of  calcination to pay heed to the action of everything which might take  part in the processes. He was especially desirous they should consider  what part the air might play in calcinations; he spoke of the air as a  \"menstruum or additament,\" and said that, in such operations as  calcination, \"We may well take the freedom to examine ... whether  there intervene not a coalition of the parts of the body wrought upon  with those of the menstruum, whereby the produced concrete may be  judged to result from the union of both.\"    It was by examining the part played by the air in processes of  calcination and burning that men at last became able to give  approximately complete descriptions of these processes.    Boyle recognised that the air is not a simple or elementary substance;  he spoke of it as \"a confused aggregate of effluviums from such  differing bodies, that, though they all agree in constituting by their  minuteness and various motions one great mass of fluid matter, yet  perhaps there is scarce a more heterogeneous body in the world.\"  Clement of Alexandria who lived in the end of the 2nd, and the early  part of the 3rd, century A.D., seems to have regarded the air as  playing a very important part in combustions; he said--\"Airs are  divided into two categories; an air for the divine flame, which is the  soul; and a material air which is the nourisher of sensible fire, and  the basis of combustible matter.\" Sentences like that I have just  quoted are found here and there in the writings of the earlier and  later alchemists; now and again we also find statements which may be  interpreted, in the light of the fuller knowledge we now have, as  indicating at least suspicions that the atmosphere is a mixture of  different kinds of air, and that only some of these take part in  calcining and burning operations. Those suspicions were confirmed by  experiments on the calcination of metals and other substances,  conducted in the 17th century by Jean Rey a French physician, and by  John Mayow of Oxford.

The old man receives him very kindly and  told him he long wished to see him, and that he would go through his  work like a man and come back safe and sound. \"To-night,\" said he, \"I  will give you rest; there shall nothing come to disturb you, so that you  may not feel sleepy for to-morrow. And you must mind to get up middling  early, for you've got to go and come all in the same day; there will be  no place for you to rest within thousands of miles of that place; and if  there was, you would stand in great danger never to come from there in  your own form. Now, my young prince, mind what I tell you. To-morrow,  when you come in sight of a very large castle, which will be surrounded  with black water, the first thing you will do you will tie your horse to  a tree, and you will see three beautiful swans in sight, and you will  say, 'Swan, swan, carry me over in the name of the Griffin of the  Greenwood,' and the swans will swim you over to the earth. There will  be three great entrances, the first guarded by four great giants with  drawn swords in their hands, the second by lions, the other by fiery  serpents and dragons. You will have to be there exactly at one o'clock;  and mind and leave there precisely at two and not a moment later. When  the swans carry you over to the castle, you will pass all these things,  all fast asleep, but you must not notice any of them.    \"When you go in, you will turn up to the right; you will see some grand  rooms, then you will go downstairs through the cooking kitchen, and  through; a door on your left you go into a garden, where you will find  the apples you want for your father to get well. After you fill your  wallet, you make all speed you possibly can, and call out for the swans  to carry you over the same as before. After you get on your horse,  should you hear anything shouting or making any noise after you, be sure  not to look back, as they will follow you for thousands of miles; but  when the time is up and you get near my place, it will be all over. Well  now, my young man, I have told you all you have to do to-morrow; and  mind, whatever you do, don't look about you when you see all those  frightful things asleep. Keep a good heart, and make haste from there,  and come back to me with all the speed you can. I should like to know  how my two brothers were when you left them, and what they said to you  about me.\"    [Illustration: The Castle of Melvales         Swan Swan,       Carry me over,       In the name of the Griffin of Greenwood.]    \"Well, to tell the truth, before I left London my father was sick, and  said I was to come here to look for the golden apples, for they were the  only things that would do him good; and when I came to your youngest  brother, he told me many things I had to do before I came here. And I  thought once that your youngest brother put me in the wrong bed, when he  put all those snakes to bite me all night long, until your second  brother told me 'So it was to be,' and said, 'It is the same here,' but  said you had none in your beds.\"    \"Well, let's go to bed. You need not fear. There are no snakes here.\"    The young man went to bed, and had a good night's rest, and got up the  next morning as fresh as newly caught trout. Breakfast being over, out  comes the other horse, and, while saddling and fettling, the old man  began to laugh, and told the young gentleman that if he saw a pretty  young lady, not to stay with her too long, because she might waken, and  then he would have to stay with her or to be turned into one of those  unearthly monsters, like those he would have to pass by going into the  castle.    \"Ha! ha! ha! you make me laugh so that I can scarcely buckle the  saddle-straps. I think I shall make it all right, my uncle, if I see a  young lady there, you may depend.\"    \"Well, my boy, I shall see how you will get on.\"    So he mounts his Arab steed, and off he goes like a shot out of a gun.  At last he comes in sight of the castle. He ties his horse safe to a  tree, and pulls out his watch. It was then a quarter to one, when he  called out, \"Swan, swan, carry me over, for the name of the old Griffin  of the Greenwood.\" No sooner said than done. A swan under each side,  and one in front, took him over in a crack. He got on his legs, and  walked quietly by all those giants, lions, fiery serpents, and all  manner of other frightful things too numerous to mention, while they  were fast asleep, and that only for the space of one hour, when into the  castle he goes neck or nothing. Turning to the right, upstairs he runs,  and enters into a very grand bedroom, and sees a beautiful Princess  lying full stretch on a gold bedstead, fast asleep. He gazed on her  beautiful form with admiration, and he takes her garter off, and buckles  it on his own leg, and he buckles his on hers; he also takes her gold  watch and pocket-handkerchief, and exchanges his for hers; after that he  ventures to give her a kiss, when she very nearly opened her eyes.  Seeing the time short, off he runs downstairs, and passing through the  kitchen to go into the garden for the apples, he could see the cook  all-fours on her back on the middle of the floor, with the knife in one  hand and the fork in the other. He found the apples, and filled the  wallet; and on passing through the kitchen the cook near wakened, but he  was obliged to make all the speed he possibly could, as the time was  nearly up. He called out for the swans, and they managed to take him  over; but they found that he was a little heavier than before. No sooner  than he had mounted his horse he could hear a tremendous noise, the  enchantment was broke, and they tried to follow him, but all to no  purpose. He was not long before he came to the oldest brother's house;  and glad enough he was to see it, for the sight and the noise of all  those things that were after him nearly frightened him to death.    \"Welcome, my boy; I am proud to see you. Dismount and put the horse in  the stable, and come in and have some refreshments; I know you are  hungry after all you have gone through in that castle. And tell me all  you did, and all you saw there. Other kings' sons went by here to go to  that castle, but they never came back alive, and you are the only one  that ever broke the spell. And now you must come with me, with a sword  in your hand, and must cut my head off, and must throw it in that well.\"    The young Prince dismounts, and puts his horse in the stable, and they  go in to have some refreshments, for I can assure you he wanted some;  and after telling everything that passed, which the old gentleman was  very pleased to hear, they both went for a walk together, the young  Prince looking around and seeing the place looking dreadful, as did the  old man. He could scarcely walk from his toe-nails curling up like ram's  horns that had not been cut for many hundred years, and big long hair.  They come to a well, and the old man gives the Prince a sword, and tells  him to cut his head off, and throw it in that well. The young man has to  do it against his wish, but has to do it.    No sooner has he flung the head in the well, than up springs one of the  finest young gentlemen you would wish to see; and instead of the old  house and the frightful-looking place, it was changed into a beautiful  hall and grounds. And they went back and enjoyed themselves well, and  had a good laugh about the castle.    The young Prince leaves this young gentleman in all his glory, and he  tells the young Prince before leaving that he will see him again before  long. They have a jolly shake-hands, and off he goes to the next oldest  brother; and, to make my long story short, he has to serve the other two  brothers the same as the first.    Now the youngest brother began to ask him how things went on. \"Did you  see my two brothers?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How did they look?\"    \"Oh! they looked very well. I liked them much. They told me many things  what to do.\"    \"Well, did you go to the castle?\"    \"Yes, my uncle.\"    \"And will you tell me what you see in there? Did you see the young  lady?\"    \"Yes, I saw her, and plenty of other frightful things.\"    \"Did you hear any snake biting you in my oldest brother's bed?\"    \"No, there were none there; I slept well.\"    \"You won't have to sleep in the same bed to-night. You will have to cut  my head off in the morning.\"    The young Prince had a good night's rest, and changed all the appearance  of the place by cutting his friend's head off before he started in the  morning. A jolly shake-hands, and the uncle tells him it's very probable  he shall see him again soon when he is not aware of it. This one's  mansion was very pretty, and the country around it beautiful, after his  head was cut off. Off Jack goes, over hills, dales, valleys, and  mountains, and very near losing his apples again.    At last he arrives at the cross-roads, where he has to meet his brothers  on the very day appointed. Coming up to the place, he sees no tracks of  horses, and, being very tired, he lays himself down to sleep, by tying  the horse to his leg, and putting the apples under his head. Presently  up come the other brothers the same time to the minute, and found him  fast asleep; and they would not waken him, but said one to another, \"Let  us see what sort of apples he has got under his head.\" So they took and  tasted them, and found they were different to theirs. They took and  changed his apples for theirs, and off to London as fast as they could,  and left the poor fellow sleeping.    After a while he awoke, and, seeing the tracks of other horses, he  mounted and off with him, not thinking anything about the apples being  changed. He had still a long way to go, and by the time he got near  London he could hear all the bells in the town ringing, but did not know  what was the matter till he rode up to the"]]]
